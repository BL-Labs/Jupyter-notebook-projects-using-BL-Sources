Get out of my sight, will you ? And take care to shut my door, and both the passage doors, so that I may lose some of that maddening music.\" Lilian, ten years old to-day, and the eldest of my flock, looked at me earnestly. Her wondering eyes grew moist, her mouth drooped and quivered. \" It's m-m-my birthday party, Daddy dear,\" she murmured wistfully. \" Then go and enjoy it \u2014 if you can,\" I retorted. And she went, trying to hide her tears, and to walk proudly."], [10, "A Month os Madness. 2 The child's fortitude stung me sharply. Yet, when one's mind is savage and bitter, there is a certain satisfaction in playing the brute. I had spoiled the little thing's pleasure, which she had been hugging to herself for six months or more \u2014 and I was glad, in a sort of way. \" Do you feel any better for that ? \" asked my friend Yarmshaw, who was smoking with me in my study \u2014 the only room free from the children's-party atmosphere that had been filling the house for the last week, from attic to basement. \" Would you like to join the children ? \" I rejoined savagely, adding more quietly \u2014 for my mood was oddly changeful \u2014 \" to tell the truth, I wish you would, old fellow. I'm not fit company for any one to-night, and the little rogues must be badly off for a master of the revels.\" \" I know that,\" he answered coolly ; \" but as far as I can judge, the master of the house"], [11, "A Month os Madness. 3 is the person most in need of assistance under this roof to-night. What has come to you, Hal ?\" I could not at first answer the question. Yarmshaw is a man of cold, cynical tempera- ment, who dominates me at all times when the mind has free play. In moments of action, when the blood rules us, I take the lead ; but as soon as passions cool, and muscles are at rest, I drop back into his wake again. We fell into these respective parts years ago in our Winchester days, and have retained them ever since. Yarmshaw has the calculating, and combinative faculty of a great strategist. I could never have been anything more than a hot-headed rough- and-tumble company officer. The muscular moments, too \u2014 those few and far between epochs in which I got my chance and won my spurs \u2014 have nearly always been led up to by Yarmshaw. He used to make the quarrels, and never until the battle was"], [12, "A Month os Madness. 4 joined did I succeed in thrusting him aside. In truth, he is innately combative, as well as destructive. He cannot work off the slaughterous spirit, which seems common to most men, by ordinary process of sport, as I can ; his pleasure of the chase consists mainly in hunting down man's ideals and aspirations. He would have set all Utopia by the ears in a week. With him, the ordinarily sound maxim : \" What's up is truth, what's down is heresy,\" must be read backwards. At the present time, for instance, he is a pronounced Radical, because the Tories happen to hold possession of the state coach ; but I am well assured that the moment the latter tumble from the box seat, that quiet, smooth - flowing tongue, whose bitter power the House of Commons knows so well, will be turned upon his former friends. But whithersoever he turns, and whatsoever be his latest whim, I know well that he will take me with him : that"], [13, "A Month os Madness. 5 his party will be my party ; his opinions mine : that his latest theory \u2014 whether as to the shape of a hat or the future of the universe \u2014 will possess and dominate me, until \u2014 it shall please him to change it again. \"What has come to you ?\" he repeated, after a pause, with his strong, sad eyes, which always master me so, calmly investi gating mine. For answer, I took up a volume that lay upon my smoking-table, and tossed it over to him. \" My book,\" he said indifferently; \"well, what of it ? \" \" Are its conclusions deliberate ? Am I to take them for truth ? \" \"My dear Hotspur\" \u2014 he addressed me by the old nickname which followed me from Winchester to Oxford, and which I fear will cling to me to the end of the chapter \" I wish you were not so impressible.\" \" Don't put me off with such stuff as"], [14, "6 A Month of Madness. that!\" I cried angrily, \"but let me know once for all whether or not that book, ' The Moods of a Human Automaton,' sets forth your real convictions.\" \" The convictions of one mood, no doubt ; but put a penny in another slot, stimulate another group of brain-cells, and you'd haply get a very different book from me \u2014 a theo logical work, say, or, for aught I know, an apology for cannibalism. How can you trouble your head about the convictions of any man when you know that they hinge upon the state of the weather, or of his digestive organs ? With a little practice in a certain kind of analysis you could easily trace back every theory propounded in that book to brain-fag, dyspepsia, or what-not.\" \" I see that you meant what you said, and mean it still. Man is nothing but a deli cately adjusted automaton, having no more moral responsibility than an insect or a mollusc.\""], [15, "A Month of Madness. 7 \" Psha ! Burn the book, and forget all about it \u2014 as most sensible people have done already.\" \" I can't forget it, for, as I will explain shortly, something has occurred that makes the truth or falsity of your views of im mediate and vital importance to me.\" \" You are working yourself up into a state, I perceive, just in your old fashion. Have you been visiting that hospital again ? \" \" Several times lately.\" \" Ah, I thought as much ! \" \u2014 Yarmshaw snapped out the words rather fiercely for so serene and emotionless a man \u2014 \" I've told you many times that you are not fit to go among suffering people. Why, shall I ever forget that day at Winchester when you had to take me up for a flogging ? You never could bear to witness pain : that's your weak side, and you ought to guard it constantly.\" \" It's impossible to do so, as I have proved"], [16, "8 A Month of Madness. by trial. Pain confronts one at every turn ; and the Problem of Pain has been harassing me all my life. I shall- never shake myself clear of it ! \" \"You are an odd fellow, Hal; at once morbid and reckless, soft-hearted and hot blooded.\" \" Well, from your point of view, it's morbid to feel anything intensely, and reckless to carry any idea through to its logical issue.\" \" Carry an idea, man ? You never did such a thing in your life. The idea has to carry you ! You mount on its back, hide your spurs in it, and gallop madly on till you've ridden the thing to death, and so got for yourself a stunning fall, which it takes you a month to recover. There's that hos pital, now \u2014 why couldn't you content your self with pouring out your money in the endowment of a new ward, and leaving your wife, the best and most sensible of women, and \u2014 save where your friend Yarmshaw is"], [17, "A Month of Madness. 9 concerned \u2014 the most charitable, to do the visiting ? You kept your sanity pretty well until you took to thrusting your nose among the sick and suffering. Under some circum stances the practise of philanthropy may be more vicious than vice itself.\" \" Shall I tell you the secret of my late hospital visiting, Yarmshaw ? \" \" No need, I assure you : it lies in your temperament, and is no secret to me. Haven't I witnessed a score of your Hotspur gallopings ? \" \" You are wrong for once,\" I answered quietly ; \" the secret lies this time in an accidental discovery, which came about thus. I happened to visit ' our ward,' as we call it, one day when my wife was out of town, and one of the patients \u2014 a poor devil evidently marked for death, and who had been suffer ing acutely for months \u2014 gave me a full history of his ailment, as sick men are so apt to do.\""], [18, "A Month os Madness. 10 \" Well ? \" \"Well, I have, within the last few days, discovered in myself precisely the symptoms that marked the incipient stage of his disease. Yarmshaw, I have no earthly reason to doubt that I am booked for the same weary jour ney, broken by painful operations, that he has just completed. The man died this morning.\" Yarmshaw started from his chair. I could see from his frightened stare that he thought my reason was going. \" There's no madness about me,\" I con tinued brokenly, \"save that of despair. If you care to consult the senior surgeon of our hospital, who examined me to-day and was forced to admit that my fears are well grounded, he will corroborate what I have told you.\" My friend accepted this statement in per fect silence. He turned away from me, and we remained for some moments apart"], [19, "A Month os Madness. 11 and motionless. Then, the craving for human sympathy being strong upon me, I walked across and laid my hand upon his shoulder. \" Say something, old fellow,\" I murmured ; \" give me a word of some sort, for the burden is more than I can bear alone. Help me, for I'm in sore need. You are my guide and leader ; I have founded myself upon you. If you can't help me, no one can.\" \" You may be utterly mistaken, Vellacott. Again, even if this surgeon's diagnosis be sound, you have a fine constitution, and with your power of vitality you may be well able to shake off what has been fatal to many weaklings.\" \" Yes, there is that small hope, and I hug it close ; yet I must shape my life on the assumption that it will probably come to an end shortly. If the symptoms continue, and if the approved remedies, after a fair trial, fail to arrest the disease, it would be"], [20, "A Month of Madness. 12 absurd for any one holding our views to go on wading through the morass of suffering which must needs precede death in the ordinary course, would it not ? \" \" You mean \u2014 \" Suicide ? \u2014 of course I do. What else could a Human Automaton mean ? \" I paused expectantly ; but Yarmshaw would not give me even an acquiescent glance, much less the cordial word of ap proval for which I longed. He seemed vexed with me for coming to a conclusion that was but the logical outcome of his teaching. \" It seems, then, that you will fail me in my hour of need ? \" I cried bitterly. \" Your philosophy of nihilism, which you have im posed upon me with all your force, has darkened ten years of my life, yet you now grudge the one boon that it has power to bestow upon me \u2014 the right of ceasing to exist at will ? \""], [21, "A Month os Madness. 13 Still my friend answered nothing : he had the look of one who, having constructed a deadly engine, fears to see it set in motion. \"Well, Yarmshaw, I won't dwell further on that at present ; but I do ask your sym pathy for the plan of campaign upon which I am now about to enter.\" \"Campaign against what?\" his words came reluctantly : his face was full of a vague disquiet, not unmixed, it seemed, with resentment. \" Against Human Suffering ; the plan of which the idea has been in my mind for I know not how long, and which, under the stress of this personal trouble, cries aloud to me, as it has never cried before. Put your self in my place for a moment. The mental attitude which is common to us both leads you and me to very different issues. You take a cynical pleasure in the assurance that whatever is, is wrong, that human life is a tangle of pains and futilities which nothing"], [22, "A Month of Madness. 14 can ever put right. But to me the groaning of the world has an appeal and a meaning : I can't acquiesce in it as it stands. I'm a man under sentence of death, with perhaps but a few weeks to work in \u2014 but something I must do!' \" Do pull yourself together and cease your raving,\" he muttered sulkily. \"Your chance lies in keeping your mind steady, and \" \" A curse on your commonplaces ! \" I cried. \" You ought to be the last man in the world to inflict them upon me.\" Yarmshaw leaned back in his chair with a fretful sigh, muttering, \" I ought to have left you in happy possession of the old fictions ; with your peculiar temperament you are fitted for nothing else.\" That was all the sympathy he was capable of offering me. He had always seemed somewhat callous to the sufferings of \"the general,\" but somehow I had looked for a"], [23, "A Month os Madness. 15 different attitude from him in this case, the person concerned being his chosen friend. He appeared even to resent my being in trouble, to be anxious to get away from me. \" It is too late to talk of ' the old fictions,' \" I answered after a moment's pause ; \" you've crushed them to powder long ago. But if you could see your way to some small modifi cation of your views, if there were anywhere a weak spot in your absolutism \" He stopped me with a quick shake of his head. The man was always bitterly honest, and rigidly consistent to any theory that happened to possess him. I do not believe he would soften a thought, or pare down a hypothesis that he considered sound, to save the life of his nearest friend. Moreover, his philosophy knew not a semitone : his hatred of compromise was even more fervid than my own. \" Well, well, then stick to your all-round"], [24, "16 A Month os Madness. negations, and listen to my Plan of Cam paign, which is nothing but their logical expression in deed and action.\" \" I wish to hear nothing about it, Vella cott.\" \" Then you shall hear it ! \" I retorted hotly. \" You've always pressed your views upon me without regard to my wishes, and without giving a thought to the hopes and aspirations which you've killed, and it is but fair that you should know whither they have at last led me.\" Then I dropped my voice to a whisper \u2014 and the whispered words sent the blood flying from his face. He listened for a few moments, with lips white as death, unable to find voice enough to interrupt me. At length he drew himself up with a shiver, muttering hoarsely, \" My God ! \u2014 with such a maggot in your brain as that, you're not fit to go loose about the world ! \" \" I'm what you have made me, Yarmshaw"], [25, "A Month os Madness. 17 \u2014 a piece of your own handiwork. Upon this one point I am mad, if you will, and perhaps my state of health has to answer for it ; but, right or wrong, my mind's made up, and though I have but a few weeks to work in \" At this moment, through the opening of some door, a gush of dance music, mixed with children's laughter, came sweeping down the passage \u2014 a dreadful sound to me just now, so dreadful that I bowed myself down to indulge my anguish for a space. \" I'll have you locked up, by God, if you stick to this ! \" Yarmshaw jerked out the words in the tone of one who, after a fierce struggle, has suddenly got his heel upon the neck of some deadly reptile. \"As you please,\" I answered dully; \"by doing so you would relieve me of an awful burden \u2014 the hardest ever laid upon a man by the stern task-master, Duty. But of course, in that case, I should feel no 2"], [26, "18 A Month os Madness. obligation to go on living ; and I need hardly tell you that, my resolution being what it is, I carry the means of death about with me. \" Where ? \" That is my secret. Enough that I can snap the life-thread at a touch. As the poet says truly \u2014 ' There are blind ways provided, the fordone Heart-weary worker in this pageant world Slips out by, letting the main masque defile By the conspicuous portal.' \" At this point Yarmshaw rose, saying hastily, \" I'm going now.\" \" Do you intend to take steps against my liberty, or to leave me alone ? \" \" To leave you alone, Hal, hoping that you will come to your senses after a night's rest, and sweep all that cursed stuff out of your mind.\" \" Good night, then, Yarmshaw.\" \" Good night. I'll look you up again in a day or two.\""], [27, "A Month of Madness. 19 He left me quite reassured, as he thought ; but Yarmshaw had no skill in deception, and I read his face without difficulty. He had it in mind to thwart me, and half an hour's reflection would doubtless complete any half-formed decision. I had to count Yarmshaw, the only soul who knew the secret of my scheme, as an enemy \u2014 one who would strike quickly, too. There was not a moment to lose. I had been immersed nearly all day in a certain problem, and must now accept on the instant one or other of the solutions \u2014 all more or less inadequate \u2014 that had offered themselves. The problem, now further complicated by Yarmshaw's knowledge of my intentions, was as follows : \u2014 For the carrying out of my purpose or plan I required a period of four or five weeks, during which I must be living in close con tact with other men, yet absolutely secluded from every soul that knew me. I must, in fact, be dead to my friends. Meanwhile"], [28, "A Month os Madness. 20 Yarmshaw must be satisfied that I have given up all thought of my mad scheme, and am safe for the present; and, further, my anxious wife, who is already troubled about me, must be freed from concern during my absence. These were the cardinal points ; the minor details will keep for the present. Now, in this difficult juncture, I was lucky enough to have two favourable chances offered me. For, as it happened, I was under an engagement to join my cousin, Charles Vellacott, who had taken a piece of trout-fishing on the Spanish side of the Pyrenees, and three days ago I had been actually on the point of starting thither, being only withheld at the last moment by the state of my health. Moreover, my wife, thinking my ailment to be of the nervous kind to which I was subject, and which usually yielded to a few weeks' change of air, had been strongly urging me to make"], [29, "A Month os Madness. 21 the effort and give the fishing a chance. So there was an exit from the home circle ready provided for me. Furthermore, I had received this evening, just before Yarm shaw's arrival, a telegram from my sailing master at Southampton, to the effect that my new forty-rater, the Imogen, had been run down at her moorings by a coasting ketch. This message I had, in my troubled state, tossed aside without giving it a thought, but I now perceived that it would come pat to my purpose. The message, in fact, provided me with a ready-made excuse for leaving town at once, by the first train I could catch, while the fishing excursion would give me four or five weeks clear at a stroke. For listen. I had but to tell my wife that I had fallen in with her views, and hoped in a day or two to muster energy enough for the Spanish journey ; in short, that, after seeing to the repairs of the yacht, I"], [30, "A Month of Madness. 22 might very likely go straight on from South ampton, vid Havre \u2014 and my cable would be cut. She was accustomed to my head longs habits, and would be relieved to find that my old spirit was returning. Then to-morrow, or next day, I should be seen on board the Havre boat by some of my yacht's crew ; and afterwards, by an arrange ment which had occurred to me earlier in the day, and which will be set before you in due course, letters descriptive of my angling adventures, gradual recovery of health, and so on, would arrive from Spain every three or four days, the while I was actually at home in England \u2014 perhaps not fifty miles from London. By this means I should sever every rope which bound me to home and friends, save that leading through my cousin Charles, whom I could trust entirely, and who, when duly hoodwinked, would I knew be a mere puppet in my hands. Were Yarmshaw to"], [31, "A Month os Madness. 23 call next day, he would hear of my departure, and be reassured as to my state by those at home ; and, should he follow me to South ampton, it would only be to hear from the yacht's crew of my departure for the Con tinent. To him also I miobt write from Seganza, the Pyrenean village, with assur ances of my return to sanity. Yes, I had it all clear now \u2014 there remained only to put my simple plan of self-effacement into execution. The first step would be to ring for my sen-ant, and order out the already-packed luggage. That seemed a simple thing to do, yet there were agonized moments to be got through before I could accomplish it. My agitation was at first overmastering. That bell-pull was to me the throttle-valve of an engine whose machinery, once set in motion, I should have no power to check. Once clear of home, there could be no going back, no return to the arms of a beloved wife, to the clinging"], [32, "A Month os Madness. 24 hands of my little children. I was doomed not merely to death, but to the carrying through of a fearful task, the accomplishment of which, were there no \"blind way pro vided,\" must, in the present constitution of society, make of me an outcast among men. Brief as was the parting scene, my forti tude barely sufficed to carry me through it. My wife came at my summons, and stood before me, radiant and smiling as though with the reflected light of all the happy little faces from whose midst she had emerged. With affected indignation I showed her the telegram, exclaiming \u2014 \" There, you see ! Our smart little craft but just fitted out, yet smashed up already by some lubberly coasting skipper ! \" \" Well, that is vexing, dear ! I see you mean to be off at once. Are you well enough for the journey, Harry ? \" \" Oh dear, yes ; this exasperating accident"], [33, "A Month os Madness. 25 has shaken me clear of the megrims. I'm well enough.\" o But her tender eyes were clouding with anxiety. \"Let me go with you, dearest,\" she urged. \" I could be ready dressed for the journey in an hour, and Lady St. Petrock would take charge of our little guests. What train shall we catch ? \" She little knew how torturing was her solicitude ! I had to maintain a feigned fury of impatience, to allay her fears, promise a shower of letters and telegrams, broach my intention of probably going on to Spain, the while her eyes searched and probed me. I declined even to have the little ones extracted from their ball-room, insisting that the cab would be at the door immediately, and that it would be a pity to break in upon their enjoyment. But enough ; I could not bring myself to dwell upon that parting even it were"], [34, "26 A Month os Madness. necessary. Suffice it that I did contrive to reassure, at least partially, that sweet wife whom I was deceiving ; and so got fairly away into the hall. Here, however, Lilian caught me, clinging round my neck with a hundred kisses, and, with her fresh young cheek laid against mine, forcing from me many lying promises of a speedy return. But at length I found myself seated, half dazed, in a cab, bowling smoothly away towards Waterloo Station \u2014 bound, as you know, upon a dark and terrible journey, but the full horrors of which you can as yet but guess at. In truth, O reader-friend, I would entreat you to pause a moment before deciding to follow me into the pit whither my path now leads me. I feel that it is my solemn duty to tell the tale of that journey, now while it still rings in my brain, because it may chance to save some soul, stricken as I was, from a madness like that which befell me."], [35, "A Month os Madness. 27 Yet let not the whole man, who needs not the surgeon's knife, draw near to the operating table ; and let the fortunate one, who has never yet broken forth from the Happy Valley, remember that he cannot leave it in my company without tasting of worse things than ever befell the Prince of Abyssinia."], [36, "A Month of Madness. 28 CHAPTER II. T is curious to note how a scheme 1B^1 which months of hard thinking have left in the embryonic stage will develop suddenly at the first touch of action. Make a move of some sort, take a step, howsoever feeble and tentative, and, lo ! the formless thing, upon which all the grinding of your brain seems to have made no impression, becomes a tool shaped and fashioned to your purpose. Such, at least, was my experience that night ; for hardly had my train drawn clear of the terminus when my Plan of Campaign, an hour or two ago so vague that I could give but the crudest outline of it to Yarmshaw,"], [37, "A Month of Madness. 29 stood forth crisp and clear to my gaze. I knew then just what I had to do, and with that knowledge came a quickening of my courage, a hardening of my purpose ; I felt all the audacity of a fanatic who has given a first stroke to that iron wedge wherewith he hopes to rive the world asunder. As I stretched out of the train window to look back, it seemed to me that all the pain and misery of the great city were rising up like a smoke, which, as in some Eastern story, was shaping itself into the form of a mighty genie \u2014 the demon against whom so many of the great, the good, the wise, have striven in vain. Yet this monster, together with all his dark brethren, I, Henry Vellacott, a mere ordinary man, equipped with nothing newer than a fervent love of humanity and a dogged resolve to carry a certain idea to its logical conclusion, was about to assail single-handed."], [38, "A Month os Madness. 30 Thus did I begin my journey full of a strange exaltation, which yet somehow had in it more of pain than beatitude. Before the real work could begin, however, there were yet some preliminaries to be dealt with, and to these a few sentences must be devoted. Next morning, my courage being no whit abated, the business at Southampton was readily transacted. I faced many old friends at the Yacht Club, and by them was con doled with, and questioned as to the Imogen. With them I discussed the best method of bringing the ketch's master to book, the chances of the coming racing season, my Spanish expedition, and so on ; in short, I went through all the solemn mockery that was needful. Then I handed my damaged ship over to a well-known firm, heard their surveyor's report, and gave all necessary orders to my sailing-master. Next morning I was free to sail for Havre, and was"], [39, "A Month os Madness. 31 actually seen on board by several friends. Thus I had got clear of Yarmshaw, and had left behind me sufficient evidence of my changed state to relieve his mind \u2014 I had, in fact, obliterated my trail. Havre was not in my programme, save as a halting-place. I disembarked there only to await my cousin's answer to a letter sent off on the morning of my arrival at Southampton. This letter contained a con fession, partly true, and an earnest appeal to his old friendship. I told him the truth as to my state of health, since nothing more suitable to my purpose could well have been invented. That groundwork of fact made an excellent foundation for the requisite superstructure of fiction. Charles was informed of my scheme of self-obliteration for a period, but not of its true object, which was set forth as the sparing of my wife the weeks of anxiety and suspense that must pass before my"], [40, "A Month os Madness. 32 disease either succumbed to treatment or attained the point where all hope of cure must be given up. I laid stress on this possibility of final cure, and of the immense gain that must accrue from my plan of benevolent deception. The whole trouble, as I pointed out, might be made a blank page to my wife, and might so continue to the end of her life. My kind-hearted cousin would assuredly fall in with so commendable a scheme. As I conned the letter I felt certain that I had him fast. I told him that, by my surgeon's advice, I was going to move quietly about from one watering-place to another, now on this side of the Channel, now on that, mean while giving all the approved remedies for my case a thorough trial. The letters to my wife, which from time to time would be forwarded to him for postage, would keep her mind at ease during this period ; and, further, the seclusion from all my friends which would"], [41, "A Month os Madness. 33 thus be made complete was precisely what my medical advisers desired. How could Charles fail to be hoodwinked ? He knew me for an honest hot-head who had never deceived a soul : by no conceivable possibility could he guess at the madness that now possessed me. Well, I was not to be disappointed. Charles's answer was all that I had hoped for, and on receipt of it I at once started back for England. I well remember going on board the Southampton boat, rejoicing in my now perfectly achieved freedom, yet with my satisfaction still backed, as it were, by a dark belt of fathomless depression. I seemed to be standing upon a lonely isle, sunlit and flower-strewn, but girt about by dense mists, beneath which a black sea of death was weltering in slow breathless heaves ; soundless and colourless, though its ebon surface was rising inch by inch as it 3"], [42, "A Month os Madness. 34 brimmed up, ever higher and higher, in its effort to swallow the narrowing islet that was my last refuge. During most of that short voyage, and the subsequent train journey, I must have been in a state of semi-stupor, for I remember scarcely anything that passed. Indeed, memory seems to strike the mind in waves which, in falling back to gather fresh force, leave successive blank spaces that have neither colour nor meaning. In look ing back upon the pregnant stormful period upon which I was now entering, and of which I believe there was hardly an hour but brought its soul-shock of power enough, one would think, to stamp itself upon the consciousness for ever, I yet find some spaces that are dark to me ; though on emerging from these, I always find myself plunging anew into a past so vividly real that not a pang of it is spared to me. The next wave of memory brings back"], [43, "A Month os Madness. 35 to me the platform of a country railway station. The adjacent town was my goal, or at least my first goal ; though, if the luck were against me, or the conditions unfavourable here, I might have to try several others. In point of size, however, distance from London, and one or two other points which will appear hereafter, it promised to suit me well. I was curious to see what sort of impres sion I might make upon porters and others, for my dress, and even my luggage, had been designed with a special end in view. My clothes, though old, were well cut ; my other belongings meagre, but respectable. I inquired anxiously for a cheap hotel, as near the middle of the town as possible. The porters answered me respectfully, but there was none of the eager civility to which one is accustomed. They seemed to take me for a gentleman, but one of small consequence \u2014 even as I desired. I"], [44, "A Month os Madness. 36 requested them to take charge of my two small portmanteaus, upon which my new name, \" Hamo Vincent,\" was painted, while I went to make inquiries at an hotel which they named. The attitude of the people at the inn, which called itself an hotel, proved equally reassuring. They received me without surprise or effusion ; and, as I wished to evoke no curiosity, but to sink quietly into the life of the place, it seemed well to give myself out at once as an artist who had come hither for sketching purposes. The landlord, after looking me patron izingly up and down, accepted my account of myself as so perfectly natural that he forthwith lost all interest in me \u2014 another tribute to my successful performance of a chosen role. Indeed, in an hour or two, the Lion knew all that it cared to know about me : I was fairly established at my first base of operations \u2014 a humble artist-stranger, free"], [45, "A Month os Madness. 37 to come or go at will ; and, though within an hour's journey of town, as completely cut off from all friends and acquaintances as if I were at the Antipodes. Yet, alas, how little did I realize how soon, how very soon, my deadly work was to begin ! After a meal, which in my present highly wrought condition was rather a tribute to respectability than anything else, I strolled forth to inspect the little town. The High Street, running past the doors of the Lion, led me over a bridge that spanned a muddy river, and so on through the most popular parts of the place. I walked right through it, leaving the shops behind me, and passed out into a country road, shadowed by elms, and fringed with villas and gardens. My impressions were altogether favourable. It seemed likely that I should find just what I wanted \u2014 a society of quiet-going gentlefolks living in a compact group, into which, by the help of a little"], [46, "A Month os Madness. 38 skill and judgment, I might hope to intro duce myself without difficulty. After this preliminary reconnaissance, I turned back as far as the bridge, and stood gazing into the turbid flood, for such the river was, as it ran bank-full with a steady vehemence that one hardly realized upon first inspection. Late rain-storms had not only filled the channel, but stirred up its bed of clay in such wise that one seemed to be standing over a great stream of yellow soup. There was something curiously impressive, too, about this quiet, unbroken rush, with its foamless, swirling eddies. As one leaned upon the bridge-rail, there was no sound of waters, no fierce hiss or deep gurgle to give a hint of the power that was beneath one's feet. It was not until a great elm branch came shooting through the central arch into the glare of the bridge lamps that I could judge fairly of the speed and might of this voiceless tide. Afterwards I watched many"], [47, "A Month of Madness. 39 other floating objects as they emerged into the belt of yellow light, to glide smoothly away into the silent blackness beyond. Presently a puff of wind, blowing straight up the course of the river, brought to my ears a deep booming sound which at once arrested my attention, as suggesting the fall of a great mass of water over some weir or lock. I had a strong desire to see this deep stealthy tide break forth into an angry rapid, or hurl itself in thunder over some barrier ; and I began at once to search for a passage downstream. The left bank was blocked with houses ; the right held a long perspective of coal sheds, along the back of which a road of some sort would doubtless run. This, in fact, proved to be the case ; and, after crossing the bridge, I turned down a dark opening, to find myself splashing through inky puddles, between ranks of grimy sheds heaped high with coal."], [48, "A Month os Madness. 40 As I proceeded, the low sound increased to a definite, hoarse roar. Pressing forward with an eagerness which, though I could hardly account for it, was irresistible, I presently emerged upon an open wharf \u2014 a wide space covered, like the road, with slimy pools, and looking gruesome enough under the sullen light of the night sky. The lock, or weir, was still at some distance. On my left I could just detect the black, silent tide, with hardly a gleam on it, curving away into the darkness. Now that I was out of sight and sound of the town, the solitude of the place oppressed me. As I stepped upon the towpath the dark river was like a stealthy foe beside me. Yet something drove me along. I could not stop or turn back. Stumbling forward too hurriedly, I presently caught my foot in a broken oar, and so barely escaped a plunge into deep water that I almost felt its cold, slimy embrace. Only by clutching at the"], [49, "A Month of Madness. 41 woodwork of the wharf did I check myself upon its brink. This narrow escape scared me horribly. The sweat poured from my forehead as I realized how even a strong swimmer, once in the grip of that steady flow, would be swept like a straw into the turmoil below, which was now growing loud in my ears. To die thus alone in the darkness, without a soul hear one's cries, was a ghastly thought even to a man with such a task as mine before him. After this I had not the nerve to follow the towpath further, but blundered along among anchors, tar-barrels, and other such obstacles, in a direction as nearly parallel to it as I could contrive. Some ten minutes of this difficult pro gression brought me once more into a clear space. On my right stood a little wooden building, probably a wharfinger's or coal merchant's office, from the window of which"], [50, "A Month of Madness. 42 a bar of dim light, as from a feeble lamp, wavered out into the darkness, emphasizing, rather than not, the loneliness of the place. I gave this but a passing glance, however ; the roar of waters on my left front captured my senses and drew me on, thrilled and fascinated. Hurrying across the open space, I found myself drawing near to a deep lock basin, into which the whole volume of the narrowed river was hurling itself with a deafening roar. I could not at first bring myself to the brink of this seething cauldron ; yet neither could I keep myself away from it. Soon I was creeping forward foot by foot until I could lean upon the opened lock-gate, every timber of which creaked and shuddered under pressure of the maddened waters. I hung over the trembling baulks, just above the gleaming crest of the fall, or rather water-slope, and realized what my fate must"], [51, "A Month os Madness. 43 have been had I fallen from the wharf above. A heavy chain was stretched across the lock's mouth, the bight of it just touching the crest of the liquid slide ; and with this the water played, tossing it to and fro as though it were a mere child's garland. Just below the chain the waters were plaited and folded together like vast thigh-muscles of a giant ; and then, as they struck the paved floor of the lock, there arose a great wall like wave, quivering up almost to the brim of the deep basin, and on the lower side falling away into a confused welter of swirl ing eddy and tossing foam which glimmered away into the darkness. The gliddery slope between the gates, just before it bored its way under the great wall-wave, held me fascinated ; its smooth faced fury impressed me far more than all the noise and violence below. I awaited, with quickened pulses, the passage of some"], [52, "A Month os Madness. 44 branch down the water-slide ; and in a moment or two something better still came sliding end-on out of the darkness of the upper river \u2014 a small raft, such as boys might use for poling about among the barges. As this drew close I perceived a small rough-haired dog crouching upon it, with his staring eyes bent upon the deadly pit before him. He moaned feebly as he caught sight of me. I could have done almost any mad thing to save him. Then, as though aware that I was helpless, he turned his eyes upon the chain, half-rising as though to snap at it. But the raft was too near the lock-gate, where the chain curved up high above the water ; in a moment it was swept down the cruel slide, and literally swallowed by the great wave at its foot. I strained my eyes to catch the raft's emergence, but it never rose until far below the lock-basin, when the upward heave of"], [53, "A Month os Madness. 45 some eddy thrust it forth, to disappear again immediately. At that moment I heard, amid the roar of waters, a sound which startled me ex ceedingly \u2014 that of a human sigh or faint groan ; and, jerking round apprehensively, I found a tall woman's figure almost at my elbow. Her hollow dead-white profile was turned towards me, for she also was staring down stream after the raft. \" The dog didn't suffer much, I reckon ? \" she muttered half aloud. \"No! for there was no struggle The life was beaten out of him the moment he went under.\" \" Who be you, sir ? \" she then asked, with a dim weary curiosity that seemed to evaporate even as she spoke. \" You were thinking that this tearing stream would give a quicker death than any still water could do, weren't you ? \""], [54, "A Month os Madness. 46 \"How d'ye know that?\" she cried sharply, starting back from me a pace. \" By right of sympathy ; for I too am one of the miserable.\" \"Why, you're a gentleman. I know that well enough by your voice.\" \"A rich man too \u2014 yet I spoke the truth all the same.\" \" You miserable ? \" \" In one respect I'm even worse off than you. I have a weary task to perform before \u2014 - I can take the step that you are meditating. But never mind me ; tell me about yourself. You've lost your husband?\" \" I don't wear black for he,\" she put in fiercely ; \" he weren't worth it ! \" \" Ah, he was a drunken, unfaithful brute, who wasted all your earnings as well as his own ; and now you're too much broken to work any more ? \" \" Be you a wizard-man ? \" she asked fearfully."], [55, "A Month os Madness. 47 \" Psha ! Any one could guess straight with such a face as yours to prompt him, though you were a handsome lively girl ten or twelve years ago.\" \" Ay, so I was ; an' Tom was a sprack enough lad when I married un \u2014 under-keeper to Sir John, with a nice cottage an' all.\" \" That makes it the worse for you now, with nothing before you but the House \u2014 and then the grave ? \" \" Maybe it does, sir. \" I see that much of the country is under water. Have you been flooded out of your cottage ? \" \" Ay, you're mighty quick, mister,\" she retorted, with a bitter smile ; \" and I am flooded out. But you han't put your finger on the worst sore yet. Look'ee here ! \" The woman then threw back a fold of her cloak and showed me a sleeping child \u2014 a sickly emaciated little object wrapped in a piece of blanket."], [56, "A Month of Madness. 48 \"You'll hardly rear it,\" I said quietly. \" There's no vital force in that little frame.\" \" A cripple from the womb \u2014 thanks to he !\" she cried hysterically. \" A cripple ; and to be bred up in the workhouse, with a hopeless, healthless, wretched life before it \u2014 poor mite ! \" \"Ay, ay, ay; that's where it is,\" she moaned. \" I might pluck up heart and work for un ; but where's the use ? His father has took care as the little un's life shall be a burden to un.\" \" So it seems ; and though charitable people will see that you don't starve, you can never be rich enough to give the child the best advice, the best food, and the other things which might alleviate his lot. Ten years hence you'll be just where you are now, only more bitter ; and he'll be old enough to know his own wretchedness. Why not put him to sleep really ? \" She understood me at once, and quavered"], [57, "A Month of Madness. 49 away from me, rocking the child and moan ing over it. \" I weren't thinking of letting the little un die alone ; I was going with un myself.\" She threw the words resentfully over her shoulder, as though I had insisted upon their separation. \" It would be better so. What have you to live for ? \" \" I meant to do it half a mile down,\" she muttered, striding moodily to and fro, \" but the quiet water scared me. My clo'es might ha' held me up : I thought it might be a long job.\" \"And so you were drawn to this rush of water ? \" \" Lord, don't it boil an' roar, an' tear at the lock-gates, and spurt up them slippery walls?\" \" Ah, you're more afraid of it now than of the quiet dark places ? \" \"No, I ain't afeard \u2014 'cept for the little 4"], [58, "A Month os Madness. 50 un. Wouldn't it strike dreadful cold on him?\" \"If you were to plunge off this lock-arm, well out into the stream, I should think you'd be drawn down the fall and under the foam before you could feel anything.\" \" D'ye think so ? Well, I believe I be afeard, after all.\" She drew back a step or two from the basin's edge, stooping and cringing as though from a threatened blow. \" There would be no disgrace, no talk of suicide among your friends, for I would give evidence to the effect that I saw you stumble and fall into the river while hasten ing along the towpath.\" \" No, no \u2014 you shan't ! \" she cried, with a new ring of angry defiance in her voice, and a sudden straightening of her figure. \" My friends, as you call 'em, shall know the truth. They've one an' all been down on me ever since I was wedded to Tom,"], [59, "A Month os Madness. 51 and they shall know what they've drove me to. I'll spite 'em all, I will ! \" I felt now that I should succeed. The desire to spite these people would supply the final spur-prick that was needful. A word or two more, and I should see her drown before my eyes. I had to turn from her to wrestle with myself, to battle with the pseudo-merciful instincts of a lifetime. I had to fight against all the pleading and the passion of my own soul. The yearning to drag her from the fatal brink, to cry, \"Live, live, live ! \" so mastered me, that I durst not turn another glance upon the woman ; I tottered, loose-kneed and trembling, to the gate and clutched at the timber for support. It would have been so easy to soothe her despair with money \u2014 with promises of a steady flow which would make want impos sible. \" Take comfort,\" a voice whispered in 'my ear, \"let the warmth slide back into your heart ; save this poor woman by a"], [60, "A Month os Madness. 52 word, then go home and thank God on your knees for your conquest over the demon that possessed you ! \" Almost \u2014 almost had I yielded to that sweet-false persuasion ; but there followed another voice, harsher, more strident \u2014 \" Coward, will you shrink at the first touch of the knife ? Will you continue to sprinkle your droplets of charity upon the vast con flagration of Human Pain ? What of the hundred other wretched ones whom you have sworn to yourself to save ? \" As I leaned upon the gate, with the clang of my thoughts drowning even the roar of the waters, the woman drew near to me again, whispering \u2014 \" Suppose there be somethin' in the parson's talk, arter all ? I wouldn't do nothin' to separate him and me. The little un might be took up to heav'n, while I \" \" There's nothing,\" I answered \u2014 \" nothing. There's nothing before you but dreamless"], [61, "A Month os Madness. 53 sleep. You are responsible to no one outside the community of your fellow creatures, who must needs gain by your loss ; for the removal of the sick or helpless cannot but be a lightening of the general burden, a gain to the general happiness.\" \" You're sure there's no chance \u2014 I shall die like that dog, and ha' done with the worry for ever ? \" \" Quite sure : better men than I have settled it.\" \" Then help me up on to the gate, mister \u2014 will 'ee ?\" She was trembling violently, but the drawn face was firm-set, the eyes fixed and hard under stress of the tense will. I helped her on to the low arm of the lock-gate which, running in prolongation of the basin wall, stretched far out over the smooth water above. For a moment or two the tall figure towered, swaying, over me, as she edged"], [62, "A Month os Madness. 54 her way outwards inch by inch ; but, when she was almost beyond my reach, a sudden choking cry escaped her : \" I can't, I can't ! Oh, for the love of God help me down ! \" Then, for her own poor sake, I put a last strain upon my tottering will, and with a fierce thrust of my left arm sent her, with the child wrapped to her heart, far out into the darkling river. Before they had time even to sink they were flashed down the fall, and so driven under the surging mass of the upper basin. Then, even as I staggered from the effort of the thrust, a frenzy of remorse seized me. A low hoarse murmur escaped my lips as I ran madly down the basin. Checking myself at the lower gates, I saw a hand thrust upward from the brown welter at my feet, and in an instant I had plunged from the wall and was fighting with the waters. I was sucked under at once \u2014 sucked into fathomless depths, as it seemed. I was"], [63, "A Month os Madness. 55 breathless, helpless, crushed and twisted by wrestling currents and eddies \u2014 and at length flung suddenly to the surface, as the raft had been. The woman was just ahead of me \u2014 a dark blotch upon the waters. I could swim now, though the undertow dragged at my feet. By a strenuous effort, I got hold of the woman, and clutched her by the hair, then flung myself on my back and found myself swerving away with my burden into a milder stream. At this moment we were hovering, I suppose, between the main current and a backwater which swept round a bay just below the lock. In a second or two more we were fairly in the backwater, gliding swiftly past the black woodwork of the tow path. I shouted with all my strength, and heard the beat of running feet. We were getting near the lower gates again, and in danger of being swept once more into the main stream, when I made a last fierce effort,"], [64, "56 A Month os Madness. and found my hand closing upon a wooden beam. We had been swept for a moment right against the bank. Then, as strong hands fell upon my arms and began to drag us upwards, I lost consciousness. Those restful moments of oblivion were brief enough, and my revival was as a sudden awakening into a new personality. For, though the same scene lay around me, and the roar of waters boomed on with the same toneless monotony, a deep change had come over my inmost self. I had passed through a belt of fire which had burned away hope \u2014 burned it to the very roots, so that for me, it seemed, it could never more put forth leaf or bud. Neither could there any more be fever or fret, for I had passed into a land of passionless despair. The passage must have occurred at the moment of my awakening, when my eyes fell upon the little dark heap that lay upon"], [65, "A Month os Madness. 57 the coaly towpath. That was the dead child \u2014 my first victim. The woman lay a little further on, and was partly concealed by the stooping figure of a man. I knew at once that the latter was a doctor, and that he was trying the regulation methods for restoring the half drowned. I felt, too \u2014 for though I was too weak to move, my mental perceptions were strangely acute \u2014 that he had as little of human warmth as Yarmshaw himself. He was manipulating the woman in a quiet business-like fashion ; one could tell, even from the pose of his head and the way his shoulders worked, that he was performing a recognized duty with perfectly official sangfroid. Nor had I much care as to the result of his efforts ; whether or no the woman returned to life, I was still a mur derer. Up to this moment something might have intervened to arrest my purpose ; some voice from heaven \u2014 the hope of"], [66, "58 A Month os Madness. which, as I now knew, had still lingered on in some dark recess of my mind \u2014 might have turned me back ; might have turned me home \u2014 home. But now I was an out cast for ever from that home, a stained soul \u2014 with a fatal brand upon me that no tears, nor contrition, nor corroding remorse, could ever wear away. Presently the doctor muttered in a level, indifferent sort of tone \u2014 \" No use, Brand ; I must persevere with the farce for some time longer, but I believe she's as dead as a door-nail. The man will recover.\" I now became aware that I was lying on my side, and that the man addressed as Brand was kneeling just behind me. He answered immediately, \" I hope he will ; I hope he will ! \" As Brand bent anxiously over me, I closed my eyes, that he might think me still unconscious. How much had either of them seen ? That must be ascertained"], [67, "A Month os Madness. 59 before I would decide upon my next move. If they knew me for what I was, I should not be long with them. The doctor, without relaxing his pro fessional efforts, soon put a question which elicited just the information I required. \" How did this happen, Brand ? How much did you see of the affair ? \" \" That is soon told, Dr. Philby. I was staying on late in my little office yonder to straighten up some accounts, and fell asleep over my work. A woman's scream, or what I took for one, awoke me; and, rushing to the door, I could just discern a tall black figure poised upon the lock arm, and a man close behind it. Then, as I stood for a moment, half-dazed at her danger, he gave a clutch as though to pull her back, and she went headlong into the darkness. Imme diately he ran madly down the lock, and plunged in at the lower end of the basin. The horror of the thing froze me for a second"], [68, "A Month os Madness. 60 or two ; and when I got to the bank here, he was swimming on his back holding her by the hair. Jove ! how he did stick to the poor thing. I thought they must have drowned together. But the backwater swept them in here, and you came up just in time to lend me a hand.\" \" The man must be an impulsive fool, who ever he may be, Brand.\" \"He's a hero \u2014 a hero!\" cried the clerk eagerly. \" Think so ? Well, label him as you please \u2014 I call him a fool. But he'll recover, as I said. Lucky for him that you were over there, and that one of my old ' chronics ' brought me down the towpath to-night. As you're so keen about the hero, you may as well run over to the house by the gasworks, and fetch some brandy.\" Brand ran off eagerly, after carefully lay ing my head upon his coat, which he had rolled up for the purpose. During his"], [69, "A Month of Madness. 61 absence the young doctor stuck to his mechanical task without once throwing a glance at me. He had a lantern placed upon the ground near him, and each time he pressed the woman's arms down, after raising them, his face came into its stream of light. A hand some face it was, clean-shaved, with mouth and eyebrows curving downwards ; full of intelligence, passionless, cynical. I envied the temperament and character suggested by the features which I thus caught in glimpses. This man would never be troubled with a morbid yearning, no wearing enthusiasm of humanity would ever possess him. He lived to investigate and observe : the plain facts of nature would serve to satisfy his soul for twice threescore years and ten. Man's future would never interest him. The exist ence or non-existence of a Creator would never concern him. A pietist would be to him as strange a creature as a fervid"], [70, "62 A Month os Madness. philanthropist. The only thing that could disturb him seriously would be the sudden cessation of all the physical ills that flesh is heir to. With luck to favour him, he might be a great pathologist some day ; and so, perchance, a more beneficent factor in the sum of things than one like myself could ever hope to be \u2014 ay, though for love of that suffer ing humanity which was to him nothing but a vast experimental laboratory, I had cast away all that was dear to me. All this I seemed to gather from his countenance as I lay there watching him, though doubtless much of it comes from after knowledge of the man. For me there was now no prospect of escape ; Brand's description of the late scene had been as it were a re-locking of my prison door. The perverse and cruel fate that was driving me forward had contrived to establish me, not as a half-crazed murderer, but as a hero-stranger who had risked his life in the"], [71, "A Month of Madness. 63 vain effort to save a poor suicide. To-morrow the little town would be ringing with my exploit ; I should be so firmly established in a position so exactly suited to the furtherance of my miserable scheme, that I must needs go through with it to the bitter end. Well, since it must be so, my work should be speedy. Pale Death should stalk through the town and neighbourhood as though some fell plague were poisoning the very air. And soon, very soon, the stricken community must needs find me out ; when, my task being accomplished, my power for good exhausted, the lesson I would teach driven home by action, as neither written nor spoken words could have driven it, I should be free to pass into that eternal sleep for which my soul longed."], [72, "A Month os Madness. 64 CHAPTER III. T RANGE that, after the tragedy of the previous night, and the black despon dency and physical prostration that followed upon it, I should awake refreshed, almost cheerful ; but so it was. Yarmshaw would have doubtless explained the reaction simply enough by telling me that the brain-cells, nerve-centres, or what-not used last night, had become wearied out, and so quiescent ; but such explanations fall rather flatly upon one who is used to consider man in the light of a suffering throbbing creature, rather than of a self-acting machine. Howbeit, my outlook upon the world, as I sat breakfasting in the coffee-room of the Lion, was, from my"], [73, "A Month os Madness. 65 own point of view, an irrationally bright one. I was even minded, now that the theoric stage had passed into the practical, to take up the cudgels with this friend who had denounced my craze as the maddest piece of folly that ever hatched itself in the brain of man ; to call him up in thought, and relate to him exactly what I had done, concluding my imaginary harangue somewhat in this fashion : \" So the child, you see, is saved from the years of punishment and pain that Nature had in store for him, the mother from the sordid struggle to which Chance had practically condemned her. Humanity, moreover, has gained more by their loss than would at first sight appear ; being saved, not only the burden of supporting them, but all the sum of that dejection which the contemplation of misfortune breeds in lookers-on. How many kind souls, think you, would have suffered through their 5"], [74, "A Month of Madness. 66 trouble, drunk in their atmosphere of de pression ? Again, all other strugglers must gain by the elimination even of one unit in the Great Competition. Nor did either of them suffer for more than a second or two.

Yes ; I may yet hope to attain my object, which, as you will see later on, is chiefly and first of all to \" What my friend, so conjured, would have answered, I know not, for at this moment Dr. Philby was ushered into the coffee-room, and with him a little dry-looking man in parson's clothes, whom he forthwith intro duced as Mr. Nowell, the rector of the parish. Dr. Philby, who seemed to be as well-bred as he was handsome, then gave up the charge of the interview, in a neat phrase or two, to the rector, and quietly took post in"], [75, "A Month of Madness. 67 the background. He had the look of a politely indifferent spectator ; but, thanks to the peril in which, despite my apparently complete success so far, I really stood, and the intensely alert state of my perceptions, I was somehow aware that he took a pro found interest in me. The bystander was my real critic, the one to whom my explan ations must really be addressed, with whose trained powers of scrutiny and deep sus picious interest I must needs reckon. What his suspicions might be I could not tell ; but something told me that Fate had pitted us against one another, that the duel between us would be to the death ; that even now, before we had apparently joined battle, a second's loss of nerve might cost me dear. From the rector I had nothing to fear. He had the look, it is true, of a shrewd clever man, but also of an honest unsuspect ing one, who could never, by any possibility, penetrate a design such as mine. He was"], [76, "A Month os Madness. 68 an odd-looking little fellow, too ; with black beady eyes, scarcely on a level with my shoulder, as he stood questioning me, with his head on one side, after the manner of a small bird. There was a smile in his eyes the while, which, as I afterwards found, hardly ever left them ; and, his mouth being also quaint and humorous, one gathered, by way of first impression, that he was always joking. When he held out his frank hand to me, I was strangely loth to touch it, but, with Philby's eye upon me, I durst not indulge such a feeling. \" I hope you are none the worse for your gallant attempt to rescue that poor thing, Mr. I beg your pardon \" \u2014 the dry little chip of a man broke into a chuckle, as though some subtle comedy were involved in the question \u2014 \" but we none of us know your name yet ? \" \" Vincent \u2014 Hamo Vincent. I fear the"], [77, "A Month of Madness. 69 name is unfamiliar to you, though, as an artist, I could wish it were other.\" The wrinkles came round his eyes again, but the chuckle was regretful this time ; the little man was plainly sympathetic. \" Well, Mr. Vincent, could you in a friendly way tell me anything about that poor woman, Mrs. Grimes \u2014 for that was her name \u2014 or would you prefer to keep all your evidence for the coroner ? I venture to ask because I have been interesting myself about her lately, and rather hoped I had persuaded her to put aside the morbid notions upon which she was evidently brooding. Do you think it possible that her fall into the river was accidental ? \" But for the presence of my enemy I would gladly have preserved the poor creature's shred of reputation ; but as it was, any needless deception would be a deliberate playing with edged tools. \" I fear there's no possibility of that,\" I"], [78, "A Month os Madness. 70 i answered ; then proceeded in the quietly explanatory manner of a stranger whose interest in the affairs was but accidental and episodic. \" You see, I was loitering upon the bridge when the thunder of the lock attracted me, and hardly had I found my way to the side of the basin, when I became aware of a dark figure on my left, raised high above the water. Turning, I saw that it was a woman, poised upon the lock-arm ; but, though I ran my hardest, I got but one futile clutch at her before she launched herself.\" \" Poor thing, poor thing ! \" muttered the parson. \" ' One more unfortunate, weary of breath.' . . . Well, well, her heart must have been black indeed \u2014 and to think that a single word of kindness or encouragement, had it come in the nick of time, might have saved her ! . . . Then you plunged into the basin \u2014 in a very gallant manner, if you'll let me say so \u2014 and nearly drowned yourself in trying to rescue her ? \""], [79, "A Month os Madness. 71 \" I couldn't get hold of her until we were well below the lock, after which I remember little until I found myself returning to con sciousness upon the towpath.\" While I spoke, Philby was glancing at a newspaper ; but I knew well that he was listening intently, weighing every sentence as it fell from my lips. \" Your courageous effort is the only bright spot upon this sad business, then,\" com mented the rector, with the smile of his eyes growing dim. \" However, that bright spot is a veritable jewel, which I shall purse up for future enjoyment. Now, pray let us do something for you, Mr. Vincent ? You are a stranger, and an artist \u2014 do you mean sketching, may I ask ? \" \" I meant to put up here for a night or two, and if I found any suitable subjects, to look out for a quiet lodging with a view to a longer stay. Here are some of my sketches.\" I opened a portfolio that lay"], [80, "A Month of Madness. 72 upon the table. \" You'll see at a glance in what groove my small talent runs.\" Now I had been drawing at odd moments ever since my school-days, and could sketch a yacht on a wind, or an animal in motion with some show of skill, while my water colour painting was just good enough to pass for that of a fourth or fifth-rate artist. This modicum of artistic knowledge and skill was now, as you perceive, to be pressed into the service of my Great Cause. The brush offered a perfectly simple and natural excuse for my presence here in a pasture strewn district. \" That trotting horse, and those cows pressing eagerly into the shallow, look to me wonderfully alive,\" my new critic said after a brief inspection of a sketch or two. \" I could even affirm that the horse would be a rough trotter\u2014 trust the instincts of a bad rider for spotting the feature ! But somehow your colour seems \""], [81, "A Month os Madness. 73 \"Ah, yes,\" I put in regretfully, \"my colour faculty is poor enough, and that's how I always find myself ' skied.' However, I manage to earn my bread in a small way, and happily have no wife or children depen dent upon me.\" \" You're a lonely man, I fear ? \" The little man peered kindly up into my face. \" Most lonely ! \" I cried, weakly giving way to my feelings for a moment. Philby never looked up ; but I had been fool enough to dangerously sharpen his curiosity by these two words. \" Well, I think,\" proceeded Mr. Nowell, whose face was now all a-twinkle again, \" that you should meet with some good subjects in our pasture meadows here, and about the valley farms ; perhaps, too, in the barge-life of the river. You would hardly find a few weeks spent in our neigh bourhood wasted, I think ; yet I must tell you frankly that I'm anxious to keep you,"], [82, "A Month of Madness. 74 so don't treat my judgment as perfectly unbiased.\" \" Thanks. I believe, with you, that I shall find matter enough here to keep me at work at least for a time. Do you happen to know of any quiet lodging that would suit me ? \" \" Let me see. What do you think, Philby? How would Miss Wilmington's do ? \" \" The High Street would hardly suit a landscape painter, I imagine.\" Philby affected to shake himself clear of the newpaper with a polite effort. \" Would not one of the outlying farms be more suitable ? \" \" I shouldn't object to the town,\" I interposed, \"for after a long day's work in the solitary fields one welcomes a little life and movement. But I hope Miss Wilming ton is an easy-going sort of landlady, for I have one rather tiresome sort of fad \u2014 chemistry. Dabbling with chemicals has always been a favourite recreation of mine.\" This was either a stroke of genius, or a"], [83, "A Month of Madness. 75 profound blunder \u2014 even now I can hardly decide which ; but at any rate I made it deliberately. For I conceived that Philby, with a view to solving the mystery that puzzled him, would certainly press into further acquaintance with me and be fre quently in and out of my lodgings, in which case he must soon discover for himself that I was experimenting with poisonous drugs. \" You see,\" I proceeded casually,\" paint ing occupies the hand and imagination, but the analytical parts of the brain very little \u2014 at least, in so far as my simple compositions go ; so I have always found a little scientific reading, varied by small experiments, a useful solace. However, I may say for myself that people generally find me a quiet sort of lodger. I dine early, keep no dog, and am seldom fussy about trifles.\" \" Oh, Miss Wilmington will do,\" chuckled the rector. \" She's a vain inquisitive little creature \u2014 just of my inches, Mr. Vincent ! \u2014"], [84, "A Month os Madness. 76 but I know she'll study your comfort, and your chemical experiments will impress her vastly. We must take him to number fifty, Philby. Don't you think so ? \" \" I shall be happy to show you that place, or any other,\" said the young doctor, turn ing to me very civilly. \" And, if you are anything of a chemist, I shall be anxious to discuss one or two points with you, for, to tell you the truth, in my ardent pursuit of pathology, I have rather neglected the higher branches of chemistry. On the other hand, I may be of some slight service to you, for my rounds take me in several directions, and, if you would care for a seat in my trap, you might reconnoitre the country-side thoroughly before committing yourself to a sketching-ground.\" I thanked him cordially, accepting his offer with hypocritical frankness ; indeed, I pro posed to myself that the very intimacy at which his curiosity was aiming should be made"], [85, "A Month of Madness. 77 to subserve my purpose. Thus did I conceive the situation, detecting in it, moreover, some germs of a revenge that would be far from tasteless ; for as my craze deepened in intensity, so did my hatred of all who should let or hinder me take me a more biting edge. Indeed, I was already becoming aware that my yearning to benefit the race was breeding in me a fearful and deadly indifference to the life of the individual ; al ready last night's remorse was merging into something not far removed from thirst for another victim. After some further friendly talk, Philby went off to see a town patient, promising to return later on to pilot me to the lodgings. The rector lingered some little time longer, and was easily persuaded to talk of the parish and its people. Men will some times thus unlock themselves more frankly to a sympathetic stranger than even to a near friend ; and as the little man chatted on"], [86, "A Month of Madness. 78 in his light jerky way, caustic but always charitable, I became possessed of much valuable information. Just before leaving, however, my uncon scious visitor was fated to plunge me at a stroke into a blacker remorse than that from which I had seemed to emerge so easily. Standing upon the threshold, after shaking hands with me, he said \u2014 \" By-the-by, I haven't yet told you one most distressing feature of last night's affair \u2014 that Mrs. Grimes's troubles were really over before she took the fatal leap. The fact is, I have for some time been working upon a brother of hers, a certain well-to-do miller who has lived estranged from her on account of that unfortunate marriage. He was stubborn enough, but even British prejudice yields in time to a well-oiled tongue, and only last night, shortly before the poor thing met her death, I extracted from him a promise to take her home, to"], [87, "A Month of Madness. 79 care for her as a sister, and to see to the treatment of the crippled child. So, you see, after many dark years she was on the brink of happiness. Well, don't forget that you're to come and see us at the rectory whenever your work permits ; and now, good-bye, in sober truth, for I'm sure you've seen enough of me for one morning.\" He went ; and I staggered back into the coffee-room, and sank down half-fainting, while a Giant Despair laid his heel upon my soul."], [88, "80 A Month os Madness. CHAPTER IV. ISflY one o'clock I was fairly established in my new quarters, at No. 50, Myrtle Terrace, in the upper part of the Hio-h Street. I had made friends with Miss Wilmington, unpacked, and rearranged my little upstair sitting-room. There was nothing to be done, pending the arrival of my midday meal, but to sit at the window looking out upon the little town which was to be the scene of my strange terrible venture. As for my new remorse, it was short lived, but most bitter. For a time I gave myself up to it, since, by this method, I find you give Despair room for self-exhaustion. \" Woe doth the heavier sit,\" says the poet,"], [89, "A Month of Madness. 81 \"where it perceives it is but faintly borne.\" Even so, but when not borne at all, when given way to utterly, the demon will burn himself, as it were, with his own fire, leaving but cold ashes to be swept from your mind. At least, this holds good with a perfervid temperament like mine, as I have many times proved. My complete prostration was, as last night, followed by a reaction as complete. I was soon cool enough to perceive that Mrs. Grimes's case involved a coincidence that was most unlikely to repeat itself. Not one in a hundred blighted lives bursts into sudden sunshine as, but for me, hers would have done. Most often, almost always I think, the burden, once fairly settled upon the shoulders, grows hourly heavier ; the clouds, once banked up, thicken ; and so the weary pilgrim gropes along his darkling way until the heart slowly breaks \u2014 \"and Death unloads him.\" 0"], [90, "A Month os Madness. 82 Yet, even though my purpose was shaping itself afresh, I remember how, as I sat with my elbows upon the open window, while the spring breeze caressed my forehead, the weirdness of my situation oppressed me. My whole environment was so natural, so commonplace, so utterly at variance with the brooding tragedy of my thoughts. The room itself was a snug little chamber ; just one for an honest bank clerk to come home to for his evening meal- \u2014 -to sit smoking in, or dreaming of his sweetheart, or chatting with an honest comrade. And outside my glance fell upon the peaceful little street, with its peaceful simmer of traffic, its groups of townsfolk, who, could they see into the heart and mind of the fanatic now seated at this upper window, would assuredly tear him limb from limb rather than let him go through with his fell designs. Along the pavement opposite my windows some of the old soldiers and sailors who"], [91, "A Month of Madness. 83 composed the chief society of the place were strolling up from the club ; schoolboys in flannels were striding along arm-in-arm ; country parsons' wives driving home from shopping ; farmers pulling up and dismount ing at the Blue Boar, just down the street, where their ordinary was held. Peaceful and happy, peaceful and happy \u2014 with the promise of summer above and around them ; with happy homes before them, bright faces to greet them, green country, and flower trimmed gardens to bathe their hearts in when the day's work was done \u2014 where was the world's misery that had oppressed me so ? What place had I here ? \u2014 what right to breathe the same air as these simple honest folks ? Within the house, too, there was a like mocking atmosphere to disturb me. Cheer ful sounds were rising up from the ground floor, to clash with my thoughts and vex my reason. Old Miss Wilmington was seated at her midday meal, chattering with"], [92, "A Month os Madness. 84 her servant. Threescore years and ten, at least, was the old lady, but full as she ever could have been of good spirits and gossipry. She had \" lived house keeper,\" as she told me, in a great family for half a lifetime ; and the family still looked after her. She had not a care in the world, or an ache worth mentioning. Nor did I find in her the assertive arrogance of her class, but only a healthily active vanity that filled up her days most pleasantly. No one in this town, I should suppose, dressed more richly, or gave more un stinted thought to the question of a new mantle than did my landlady. She had a child's gaiety, a young woman's vanity, an old woman's philosophy. Her servant was a lively country girl, fresh -cheeked, pleasant - voiced, given to carolling over her work. Trouble seemed a thing apart from this household ; the life of it was bright as a fairy-tale."], [93, "A Month os Madness. 85 Yet even as I looked forth upon the sunny street, with a creeping sense of having taken up a false standpoint, the old, old note crept into the picture, \" the still sad music \" that goes on and on beneath all the blare with which we seek to drown it, became audible once more. Up from the High Street on my left, of which Myrtle Terrace was the con tinuation, I beheld a man drawing a bath chair along the near side of the road. \"Some invalid lady,\" thought I. But the occupant of the chair was not a woman ; a strange sort of invalid, in sooth \u2014 a young man, sun-burned and bright of hue, with dark eyes and long wavy moustaches. Surely no invalid proper, but rather some devil-may-care young subaltern lamed by an accident ? Ah, would that my guess had hit the mark ! But no, it was poor old Ned Lang ton ; well known and well loved about here ;"], [94, "A Month of Madness. 86 young, dashing, reckless ; pulsing, as it seemed, with life and spirit \u2014 yet doomed. It was the first time I ever set eyes on Ned ; and, but for the pressure of those later things, which I yearn so to pour out and have done with for ever, I would gladly linger over that moment. He was talking eagerly just then to one or two friends who were escorting him home from the club \u2014 Major This, and Colonel That, as one could see at a glance. The man who was drawing him was walking un steadily, with liquorish lurchings and sudden recoveries. \" D \u2014 n you, Mike, for a drunken hound ! \" Ned roared out, just as the party came abreast of my window. \" You've been at some pothouse half the morning, I sup pose r Thus abjured, Mike made a violent effort to steady himself, and in doing so lurched outwards from the kerbstone, dragging the"], [95, "A Month os Madness. 87 chair into the middle of the road, and there falling flat upon his face. Ned laughed boisterously, but his friends on the pavement looked apprehensively over their shoulders, while one white-haired old colonel ran out into the road, holding both arms up and shouting lustily. Then, follow ing their glance, I saw a farmer seated in a gig, pulling furiously at a young horse that was bolting up the street with him. Ned, slewing round in his chair, perceived that he was right in the path of the runaway. He never flinched a whit, as far as I could see, but only called to the old soldier \u2014 \" Get back out of the road, colonel ; what's the odds whether I'm smashed up or not ? \" His was an unnatural courage \u2014 the Pro methean audacity of one who has nothing left to live for. I knew that ; but I couldn't stop myself, and death was even less to me than to poor Ned. I went headlong down the stairs, launched myself through"], [96, "A Month os Madness. 88 the open doorway, and seized the runaway by the head when he was within a few lengths of Ned's chair. I was thrown down in a moment, but managed to drag the horse towards myself; and, as I felt him coming down upon me, just managed to wriggle myself clear. There was a crash as he fell, and both shafts went to matchwood. The farmer was thrown on to the road, and lay stunned and bleeding. The near wheel of the gig just grazed the bath-chair, turning it over, though not violently. I was half-stunned, but just conscious that the old colonel was leading me into the house again. \" There, take care of the gentleman, Miss Wilmington,\" he seemed to be saying, \" for he's worth it ! \" Then I found myself sinking into an arm chair, while the old lady, trembling with agitation, leaned over me. In a moment or two, as I supposed, but"], [97, "A Month of Madness. 89 I was too much confused to judge well of time, Ned Langton was brought in, dead white and fainting. Colonel Watson, as they called him, at once got rid of Ned's bearers, banged the front door in the faces of the eager throng without, and promptly locked it. \" There, we're well rid of those gaping fools ! \" he said curtly. My brain was steadying now : I was able to stand with a little help from the furniture. Ned Langton, whom they had laid upon the sofa, was revived enough to swallow some brandy when the colonel held it to his lips. I scanned him eagerly as they raised him up to drink it. One got a truer vision of poor Ned now, as the wreck of a once-splendid young fellow. The fine frame was wasted ; the clothes hung upon him as upon a lay figure ; the hectic colour had left his cheek ; the hand that held the glass was but a bunch of bones."], [98, "A Month os Madness. 90 Yet, even so, there was incredible pluck and fire in the man : never had I seen such a scapegrace-gleam in any pair of human eyes as shone from Ned's when his faintness passed. As I looked, I called up that visionary Yarmshaw who so often had to answer my summons. \" What sort of Human Automaton is this?\" I asked. \" How comes this soul-flame in a piece of machinery that's worn out \u2014 on the point of falling to pieces ? \" But I was soon to forget the visionary friend : the real living Ned before me held me as though he had mesmerized me ; I could no more take my thoughts from him than I could my eyes. The old colonel had struck rather a pompous attitude at the foot of the sofa, as though pluming himself upon having brought the patient round so quickly. Up and down between him and the table was tottering and fluttering old Miss Wilmington"], [99, "A Month os Madness. 91 \u2014 a pitiable-funny figure ; with her old face blanched, her beautiful lace cap clinging to one ear. Ned, after surveying them both, turned his eyes to mine, and solemnly winked ! The quaintness of his glance, and the pathetical absurdity of his trying to get a joke out of the situation at all, affected me so oddly that I only choked down a burst of hysterical laughter by firmly gripping the table with both hands. \" Oh dear, oh dear ! what will the admiral say ? \" twittered my landlady. \" I expect he'll say, ' damn ! ' \u2014 he often does, you know.\" Sh ! \" cried the colonel reprovingly. \" Oh, Mr. Ned, you're a sad fellow. Will nothing ever sober you, sir ? \" The old lady's smile as she said this epitomized, as it now seems to me, the attitude of all Ned's world towards him. I have seen that tender-sorrowful, regretfully"], [100, "A Month of Madness. 92 indulgent look at one time or another upon the face of every one of the friends that used to surround him. Colonel Watson's had just the same look a moment afterwards, as he shook his head, muttering, \" A mad lad \u2014 a mad lad ! \" \" I wonder whether that old coffin-on wheels of mine is smashed up ? \" asked Ned, as he tried to raise himself to a sitting posture. \" The chair's all right,\" said the colonel, \"thanks to \" He bowed civilly in my direction. \"Ah!\" Ned exclaimed heartily, stretching out a hand towards me with a smile that passed straight into my heart. \" You're an awfully good sort \u2014 though who the deuce you may be I don't know\u2014 but as reckless a cuss as ever I saw! Do you often run amuck at bolting three-year-olds, Mr. Thing umbob?\" \"Try 'Vincent,'\" I said, while his thin fingers closed on mine."], [101, "A Month os Madness. 93 \"All right, I will. And I say, Vincent, you're such a good fellow that I'm sure you'll do me another service : you'll punch that chairman's head for me, won't you ? \u2014 unless he's dead, by-the-by. Has Mike joined the majority, Colonel Watson ? \" \" The rogue never got a scratch, and is blubbering outside the door at this moment.\" \"Hale him in, hale him in!\" cried the mad invalid. \"I want to see the d\u2014(dun derhead, Miss Wilmington ! ) wopped. Mr. Vincent won't leave a rag on him, I expect?\" Here the old lady uttered a terrified little squawk, and Ned laughed till he fell back in a violent fit of coughing. While he was recovering, we held a council of war. Colonel Watson sensibly decided to hurry off at once to Ned's home, and so to be beforehand with any breathless exag gerations of the accident that might reach Admiral Langton ; Miss Wilmington accept ing meanwhile, with true feminine satisfaction,"], [102, "A Month of Madness. 94 the charge and responsibility of the invalid. I also acquiesced gladly in the colonel's departure, because I wanted to have Ned to myself. This desire of mine was presently gratified, for, after a brief repose, Ned sat up and began to fling about the sofa-cushions ; pro ceeding next, to his nurse's horror, to stride shakily up and down the little room. \" Oh, sir,\" she cried, \" don't 'ee now ; you might go faint again ; and it makes my poor heart palpitate so ! \" \"But you mustn't let it,\" Ned retorted, with a mock-stern gesture, \" for I want you to perform the most sacred and essential duty that ever falls to woman \u2014 in a word, to cook for me. You must have a quiet mind as well as a steady hand for that ; an underdone cut let, Miss Wilmington, might at this juncture cause a lifelong coolness between us.\" \" Cook for you, sir ? \" she repeated with a half-scared chuckle, and a movement of the"], [103, "A Month os Madness. 95 fingers, as though they were itching to tie an apron over her smart black dress ; \" that's what I've been looking forward to this half hour, Mr. Langton.\" I seized this ready-made opening at once, by suggesting that Mr. Langton should join me in the upper sitting-room, thus saving Miss Wilmington the trouble of preparing two meals. Ned accepted the suggestion cordially. Indeed, some natural affinity was drawing us together ; I felt that our liking was mutual \u2014 that we were passing into friendship with a swiftness unknown to men of cooler habit. Also, I thought I knew how to take poor Ned. He was a proud man, for all his reckless unreserve, which, in truth, was part of his pride, and must on no account be pitied. After helping him up the steep little flight of stairs, I got him into an armchair by the window; then, without comment of"], [104, "96 A Month of Madness. any kind, I poured him out a reviving draught. \"Why, you must be a doctor,\" he ex claimed, after drinking off the medicine. \" No, only a dabbler in drugs. I always carry some of that pick-me-up about with me.\" 7, \" Then you carry youth and health about in your Gladstone. I'm fresh as paint now!\" Yet he was languid enough in reality, and glad to be quiet for a time. I watched him furtively as I moved about the room, already feeling that Ned Langton was no subject for me. Whatever might be his sufferings, I could never bring myself to hasten his end. He was absolutely safe from me : I could never think of touching Ned. My heart insisted that with him at least I should be free. In his one case I declined once for all to battle with myself ; for I felt that with out this one relief, this one refuge-place from the cruel tyranny of my craze, I should be"], [105, "A Month os Madness. 97 but too likely to rebel against my task, and cast it from me with loathing. This decision of itself seemed to throw a kind of halo round Ned, to bind him to me with a sacred and peculiar bond. After a meal and a glass of Madeira, Ned was greatly revived, and quite willing to tell me about himself. He had always been, it appeared, a rollick ing devil-may-care fellow ; had escaped ex pulsion from a public school by the skin of his teeth ; had got a commission in a Hussar regiment by a side wind ; rampaged about Aldershot and The Curragh pretty much like any other unbroken young colt ; had gone out to India for sport or fighting, or anything else that might turn up ; and some few months ago had come home to die. He ought to have been dead and buried ere this, but persisted in living on, just to \" sell the doctors,\" as he said. Briefly, he was a mere ordinary, worthless young scapegrace. 7"], [106, "A Month os Madness. 98 Such was his account of himself; but I took leave to see rather more in Ned than he as yet cared to offer for my inspection. Meanwhile he reclined, discoursing volubly and smoking countless cigarettes, in my arm chair. The strong light from the window fell upon his face, which told a better tale than he allowed his tongue to do \u2014 a face tanned by constant exposure to wind and sun, for nothing could keep Ned indoors, yet pathetically hollow : worn, yet full, as I have said, of vivid life ; the eyes still brilliant, the white teeth gleaming out to give point to each reckless laugh. We did not tire of each other ; neither of us felt that the other was a stranger. We seemed to plunge into friend ship as one does into the heart of a story, when intensity of interest precludes quiet perusal. Happily, no anxious parent came to inter rupt us ; indeed, as Ned inferred from his"], [107, "A Month of Madness. 99 non-appearance, the admiral turned out to be away in the country lunching with an old shipmate, and as yet knew nothing of his son's mishap. We sat on at the window far into the after noon, with the lazy sunlit street making a kind of backing for Ned's life-story, which came out bit by bit as our mutual liking deepened. His first rough sketch proved to be, as I had expected, quite inadequate. The real Ned was not in it ; indeed, the man's inner nature had never confessed itself, I believe, save to one human being. Intimate as we became \u2014 for from this time we met day after day, and, in truth, half-lived to gether \u2014 I should never have really known him but through his relation with one per sonage, the story of whom I was not to gather fully for some time. The person in question was the rector's only daughter, Estelle Nowell. Ned did, in fact, mention her name to me"], [108, "A Month of Madness. 100 once this afternoon, and his mode of pro nouncing the one word \" Estelle \" was in itself a revelation \u2014 I knew that the question of Estelle would come up for discussion sooner or later. Already the sense of comradeship had become a kind of anodyne to me. The mere discovery that it was still possible for a true-hearted man \u2014 for Ned was that, whatsoever might be his failings \u2014 to be drawn to me was strangely soothing, and the subsequent compact with myself as to the inviolability of Ned's life had warmed my very soul. The relief born of that permission to keep my hands from touch ing but one failing life might, indeed, be looked upon as the measure of my real despair ; yet for the moment I was living in that relief, resolutely barring off thought from the outer darkness that lay around it. In sooth, I was enjoying one of those interludes of peace, none the less heart-"], [109, "A Month os Madness. 101 easing for their brevity, which I now regard as the most refined of all the cruelties that Fate practised upon me \u2014 rests granted as it seemed for the sole purpose of refitting me for fresh sufferings, by the demon who was urging me forward."], [110, "A Month of Madness. 102 CHAPTER V. UR long colloquy was brought to a |BB\u00b0' close by the appearance of Dr. Philby, at whose entrance my peace of mind collapsed like an eggshell under the stroke of a hammer. My enemy had come to see how his friend Langton was progressing, and to take his new acquaintance Vincent for a drive round the country. Philby 's dog-cart was at the door, with a handsome chestnut mare in the shafts, and a smart groom at her head. It hardly seemed a suitable turn-out for a young country doctor, but I soon learnt that Philby was a man of considerable private means, and had, in fact, entered upon a"], [111, "A Month of Madness. 103 short course of general practice simply as a useful preparation for a greater career. \" It doesn't do to turn specialist all at once,\" as he explained to me on a later occasion. \" Specialism should be built upon a broad firm basis of the general knowledge which you can only acquire in this kind of practice. I might have gone through it in town, but country air, I find, favours hard reading of a night, which is a necessity at the outset of one's career.\" Before starting we saw Ned safely into his chair, in charge of the contrite and sobered Mike ; then Philby, after dismissing his man, drove off at a rapid pace. Almost immediately we were out of the town and deep among the flower-scented hedgerows. Philby was in high spirits, on account of a peculiar and difficult case, which, after puzzling every doctor in the neighbourhood, had at length yielded its secret to his subtler diagnosis, and so had"], [112, "A Month os Madness. 104 been treated successfully. His mood was a fortunate one for me : the man was all doctor, saturated for the time being with the different problems presented by the case, and so quite unfitted for the probing of his companion's secrets. Feeling, on this account, as safe as though the rector were beside me, I soon sank back into the mood lately induced by Ned's comradeship. A pleasing half-stupor crept over my faculties. As we drove westward, with the low sun blazing in our faces, the scent of the May began to intoxicate me, as the breath of no other flower can ever do. It took me back into the heart of an old springtime, when there was no burden upon my soul ; when, on such an evening as this, lustrous and rich and softly breath ing, I stood with my love, looking down the windings of the Torridge Vale ; with her hand in mine, her first love-whisper stealing upon my ear \u2014 a time when the melting"], [113, "A Month of Madness. 105 beauty of combe and stream was almost too great a load for a heart so weighted with happiness, until a labouring sigh relieved it, and the burden of ecstasy poured itself forth in one low-muttered \" Thank God ! \" An epoch ? Ay, a most transcendent epoch, for I thought then that I had the Secret of the Universe in my hand \u2014 that I knew once and for ever that God lived. My welling gratitude declared it, the snow of sunlit blossom around us proclaimed it ; the up lifted face of my love, and her streaming eyes, forced the truth into the very core of my soul. Twelve years ago, and never an unloving word between us since \u2014 and, but for the destructive intellect of one friend, she and I might be standing there now upon the old sacred spot, with, in place of the old ecstasy, a still and quiet happiness, from which, perchance, there might issue a \" Thank God \" deep as that of ecstasy itself. The old fictions \u2014 the old fictions ! Would"], [114, "A Month os Madness. 106 to God I had them back for one moment, so that I might die before the moment passed ! As we got deeper into the country, the woods thickened about the road until the very atmosphere seemed to be tinged with the bronze-green of young oak foliage. Philby pulled up once to descend at a lodge gate in the heart of a woodland, but was on his seat again in a moment or two ; the incident was too slight to check the current of my broodings. Mile after mile we traversed, until the oaken screen, which had somehow been shutting out from me the present with all its realities, opened on a sudden, and from a summit that we had gradually attained, we found our selves gazing along a stretch of the lazy winding river. The lap of its valley was a sheet of green, fading away into warm mists that brooded over the low western hills ; close under us rose the smoke of a"], [115, "A Month os Madness. 107 quiet homestead, red-roofed, compassed round with tree and blossom. \" I had selected that farm,\" said Philby, pointing down at it with his whip, \" as a sort of daily head-quarters for you. 'Blossom Farm ' it is called, and the present occupier, Richard Prowse, is a very decent sort of fellow ; rather a hypochondriac, perhaps \u2014 possibly even a little wrong in the head, though I haven't quite made up my mind on that point \u2014 but cultured above his class, and quite worth a chat with in the intervals of your work. He has a pretty daughter, whom of course he dotes on, and they live an idyllic life together in this retired nook. You could get over here on a bicycle, if you're not above that sort of thing, in a couple of hours, and spend the day among his meadows. He has plenty of cattle, and the views about here are the finest in our neighbourhood. They are hospitable people, too, and would be glad enough to get your"], [116, "A Month of Madness. 108 company now and then. However, as I have received an urgent call hither, I pre sume either Prowse or his daughter has been taken ill. We shall see in a few minutes, for I must hurry on.\" Philby then drove rapidly down the hill, pulling up sharply at the garden gate of the homestead. The building itself, which had the look of an ancient manor-house, was constructed of mellow old brick, and basking peacefully in the slant sun-rays. The porch and half the walls were buried in a mass of creepers ; the garden was a breadth of blossom, across which, from the orchards beyond, came the fluting of many blackbirds. Here, surely, was to be found the poet's \" haunt of ancient peace \" \u2014 a resting-place for sober home joys, rather than merriment or jocund revel ; a quiet corner for the spring to linger in, for the departing summer to sigh over regretfully, for rich autumn to enfold lovingly ;"], [117, "A Month of Madness. 109 a home from whose bowered doorway care and shame and pain must surely turn aside, as strangers who could look for no welcome within. Such, to me at least, seemed the atmo sphere of the homestead into which my companion now disappeared for a space. I sat, well content to be alone, drinking in the scene, yearning back as before to the old days, essaying to drown the present in a deep stream of memory. For some time the mirage of peace re mained with me, with its fair mocking colours, its memory-flowers that I scarcely dared to breathe upon, its sad musical refrain of \" might-have-been, might-have been \" \u2014 then, without hint of warning, a cry of agony came from the old house, piercing the quietude like a rod of white-hot iron. My heart stood still ; I leaned forward in the trap, crushing my hands together."], [118, "A Month os Madness. 110 Another cry ; another, and another \u2014 until I had well-nigh made the sufferer's torture my own. The old trouble, the old trouble \u2014 the world with its crust of beauty and its core of deadly pain ! How much longer must I endure it ? Why not throw up my task now at once, and have done with the problem for ever ? Philby came running out hastily, his face full of vivid interest and excitement. I saw in it none of the compassion that was consuming me. \" Prowse's daughter has been run over by a laden waggon, and can hardly live. One leg, perhaps both, must be amputated immediately, though it's a hopeless chance almost. I must have assistance and instru ments. Could you drive at once to \u2014 but stay, you could hardly find your way among the cross lanes. I'll go for Yelland my self; he'll be in at this hour. Are you coming ? \""], [119, "A Month os Madness, 111 \" No ; you'll go faster with a lighter trap.\" I jumped down as I spoke. \" Go away into the fields, then. Keep clear of the house ; you're unnerved already, I see, and could be of no use there.\" He was off at a hand-gallop, the cart leaping beneath him. I looked at the fields with inexpressible longing. Close at hand was an open gate leading into a meadow a-gleam with butter cups. Thither I stole on tiptoe \u2014 as though moving towards crime, not away from it. Reaching the gate, I steadied myself against the post. A cuckoo was calling from a copse hard by, breathing forth the very heart of the spring. I would go on, on ; deep into the dewy peace of the meadows \u2014 far out of sound of that miserable house. I had gone some distance into the field, when another cry from the house stopped me. I tried to fling myself forward, but"], [120, "A Month os Madness. 112 my feet dragged ; I stopped dead for a moment or two, then wavered away towards the copse on the right. Once buried in that thick undergrowth, no sound from the house would reach me. There was a gap in the hedge ; I avoided it, as though weakly hoping for an easier one. All along the copse-hedge I crept stealthily \u2014 towards the house now. This brought me back to a point near the gate, where I should have turned and fled. It was my last chance \u2014 I could not take it. Through the open gateway, into the road once more \u2014 the clipped-yew hedge of the garden before me, the garden wicket a little beyond. A stream of commiseration has quenched my will, and drives me along, helpless, half-drowned ; up the flower-bor dered path to the bowered porch, into a hall hung with spurs and hunting-crops. On the table a pair of lady's gloves, and a dainty little toy of a whip\u2014 hers, I know,"], [121, "A Month os Madness. 113 and used to-day. On my right hand an open parlour door \u2014 she is in there. A deep voice comes from that room \u2014 \" I have watched you, sir, and I think you had best keep away. I know your sort ; you can't bear to see pain, nor yet prevail on yourself to give it a wide berth. You had best go \u2014 there's worse to come when your friend comes back with t'other doctor.\" Strange how a strong man's voice can stiffen one's heart and mind. I am firm again already, able to walk steadily into the little parlour. The man advances a step or two to meet me \u2014 a massive, big-framed man, with bronzed face, stern mouth, and eyes full of power. \" You must forgive this intrusion, Mr. Prowse ; but can I do any little thing to help you ? \" The farmer drew a deep breath, which in a weaker man would have ended in a moan, and in silence placed a chair for me. s"], [122, "A Month os Madness. 114 Then my gaze fell upon her \u2014 a mere girl ; hardly eighteen, I should think. She lay upon a sofa by the window. I could see that she was marked for death ; for that perceptive instinct, of which I have spoken, had come to be a species of clairvoyance \u2014 I could tell at a glance whether or no an injured person were mortally struck. I breathed more freely now, seeing that the blessed shadow of death lay upon this face. It was a fair face, which mortal anguish had not yet robbed of its beauty ; the eyes were closed, the rich brown hair flung, as though by a fierce wind, about the pillows. The window was wide open, the serene smile of the evening rested on fold upon fold of the rolling landscape which it com manded. Into this scene the father, who, without taking further heed of me, had seated himself at the table, was soon gazing so fixedly that nothing but the outer frame of the man seemed to be present with us ;"], [123, "A Month os Madness. 115 he seemed to have forgotten even his stricken daughter. The man's abstraction affected me oddly. It was discordant and puzzling; more than puzzling \u2014 contrary even to reason and nature. That a brutal man, or an utterly cold-natured one, should be callous, even to the point of hurting one, at such a juncture, were conceivable ; but the farmer was neither of these. There was power, and a certain stern melancholy in his face ; but beneath the sternness no one having any love of his kind could fail to detect the presence of strong passion and deep tenderness. Nor yet had he the stony impassiveness of despair ; there was some- thing in his fixed gaze, even in his pose as he leaned upon the table, chin in hand, against which speculation broke itself as against a wall. There must be more in this affair than the keenest scrutiny of a stranger could hope to pierce as yet."], [124, "A Month os Madness. 116 The child \u2014 for one's pitifulness found a kind of comfort in regarding her as such \u2014 lay perfectly still for some moments ; then her eyelids fluttered, and her eyes opened upon me with a look of terror that froze me. \" No, no ! \" I exclaimed, reading her thought clearly enough, \" don't fear me ; I'm not a doctor, only a stranger who feels for you.\" \" Save me from them, save me ! \" she rejoined in a quick keen whisper. \" He has gone for his I can't bear it ! Oh, father, for the love of God keep them away ! Stand at the threshold and never let them cross it. Don't you love me a little still ? Have you no pity left for me ? I couldn't live through the torture ; only let me die in peace ! \" For a moment the strong man collapsed, falling forward against the table and burying his face in his hands. One felt that when he raised himself his verdict, for or against the"], [125, "A Month os Madness. 117 girl, would be delivered at once. He was not one to hesitate long, even in so difficult a crisis, or to vary by a hair's breadth a decision once given. We should know in a moment or two, without so much as a spoken word, whether his daughter was to be given into the hands of the doctors or not. I can judge now, by the light of what followed, of the shape and drift of his thoughts. His half-stunned brain was ex tangled among the \" old fictions,\" from which men infer, as they needs must, the law of sacredness of life. Starting from the old false premiss, the existence of the soul and its Maker, they reach the inevitable conclusion that the release of the soul is not, save in war, or in the case of gross crime, in man's hands. \" We must not kill,\" they say, \"that is the law;\" its corollary being, \" we must not kill, even nega tively, by withholding means of recovery,"], [126, "A Month os Madness. 118 or endangering life wantonly. Life is a ' sacred thing,' which we dare not play with.\" And in the present instance, as we shall shortly see, the father had a special reason, over and above his natural paternal longing, for keeping within the bounds of what was to him a sacred law. In face of the verdict that I felt was coming, something must be done to save this girl ; though I began to fear that I should be unable to detach, until too late, the straining gaze which never moved from his bowed head. I dared not make a move or utter a word, I could only put my whole will into my eyes, and fix them upon her. So we remained for a space, staring fixedly, my eyes upon the face of the girl, hers upon her father. Slowly, very slowly, she turned her head ; and our eyes met. I could express myself then, at least in some measure, without the help of words. Wrought up as we both were,"], [127, "A Month os Madness. 119 our minds seemed to be in actual contact with one another. \" I fear there is little hope ; he will go against you,\" I said with my eyes. The despair of her face deepened as she read the message ; I saw that she agreed with me. I looked at the window, affecting to listen intensely. She understood me at once \u2014 \" the doctors will be here soon.\" \"If his verdict should be as we fear, send him out of the room ; get rid of him, and I will help you ! \" She seemed to be at a loss here ; but by look and gesture I contrived to drive the message home. She shot a glance of wonder, and hope, and terror towards me. There was no time for another signal. The father's bent head was slowly raised ; his bronzed cheek had paled ; the quietude of his face was gone, broken up like the still surface of a pool by warring winds."], [128, "A Month os Madness. 120 \" My child,\" he murmured in a voice thin as a woman's, \"there is a chance; the doctor said so. I dare not throw it away.\" She clutched the coverlet with both hands to steady them. I could almost see the child's will wrestling with the weak flesh, working itself up for a supreme effort. \" As you please, father,\" she said softly ; \" if it be your will, I must bear it. . . . And, father dear, would you fetch my mother's Bible, which lies upon my dressing-table ? I should like you to read to me from it until \u2014 they come.\" The broad figure moved solemnly from the room ; the receding step grew faint along the hall ; the stairs creaked as he began to ascend. A mist was coming over my eyes \u2014 I could hardly see the girl's face. This time I had none of the firmness which had helped Mrs. Grimes to her end ; I could supply no persuasion ; my victim must help me or nothing could be done."], [129, "A Month os Madness. 121 A little hand was raised an inch or two ; then fell back again, too feeble to complete its pitiful little beckoning gesture. It was enough. I moved to her side. \" What is it ? \" she whispered ; \" what can you do for me ? \" I opened my hand, showing her in the palm of it a little silver matchbox. \" There's death in that,\" I muttered \u2014 \" easy, painless death.\" \" Oh, don't mock my despair. Do you really mean \" Opening the box-lid, I touched the spring of its secret compartment, and showed her that the minute chamber was packed with silvery white powder. \" That is an Eastern poison,\" I said ; \" the smallest grain of which contains what you desire.\" \" You're sure \u2014 sure ? You would not deceive me ? \" \" I could not.\""], [130, "A Month os Madness. 122 \" Is it rapid ? No pain, you said.\" \" It's action is instantaneous \u2014 far too rapid to permit of pain.\" \" My poor father would \u2014 \" Your father will know nothing. It will be assumed that you have succumbed to your injuries.\" The girl's features were no longer con tracted. Intensity of emotion seemed to have killed her pain ; as for me, it had killed all sight and sound. I could see nothing, hear nothing \u2014 the chorusing of the birds outside had ceased on a sudden. I never saw her put it to her lips ; but only felt the touch of her hand as she took the case from me ; after which my stupor deepened still more. From this state I emerged, half-dazed, as though from the influence of an an\u00e6sthetic. The strewn hair was before me again ; and, ah ! the pale sweet face, from which the"], [131, "A Month of Madness. 123 anguish had been smoothed for ever. The sublime repose which already rested upon it touched me like a strain of noble music heard from afar ; incomprehensible, bearing no message which the mind can read, yet suffusing the soul with a sense that there is somewhere awaiting it the place of rest and peace for which it has cried and longed in vain. \" And by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache ? \" We do end it, once and for ever. Through what unspeakable cowardice do we shun this quiet sleep, which permits even a weak girl to defy man's utmost malice ? Yet, even as I began to mutter these thoughts aloud, a strong hand was laid upon my shoulder. The father was beside me. \" What have you given her ? What right had you to give her anything ? \" he asked in a deep, harsh whisper. \" Rose, my child, what has come to you ? Speak to me, Rose! \""], [132, "A Month of Madness. 124 \"She'll never speak again,\" I said with difficult firmness. \" The shock of her in juries, intensified by the dread of the coming operation, has killed her.\" He stood before me, holding both my wrists in his iron grasp, and staring into my eyes. \" You lie, sir \u2014 you lie ; you've poisoned her ! \" His voice was still subdued ; neither of us spoke quite aloud throughout this strange scene. \" What makes you think that ? \" I mut tered weakly. \" Take some of the powdery stuff that I see in your silver case and swallow it your self,\" he retorted sternly, \" and perhaps that'll straighten things between us.\" At that moment, when Death seemed to be standing within arm's length of me, I made what was to me the blackest of all possible discoveries \u2014 that I had lost my willingness"], [133, "A Month of Madness. 125 to die. My readiness, or rather earnest wish for the end, had hitherto been my one prop. So long as that held good I could go through anything, feeling the \" blind way \" of escape always open to me. I was now like a close-hunted fugitive panting up to the gate of a city of refuge, only to find it barred and bolted. I could not face death now : the intensity of my cowardice brought great sweat-drops to my forehead. What had changed me so utterly ? I could not tell ; I only knew that the \"blind way\" had become on a sudden an alley leading to some unknown horror, before which my soul quailed. \" Well, I see how 'tis clear enough,\" said the farmer ; \" but, after all, you shan't touch the poison \u2014 you don't deserve such an easy death. I'll give you up to justice.\" That threat revived me somewhat. A courage of despair was coming to replace that older courage which had left me so"], [134, "126 A Month os Madness. suddenly, and the sharp sting of man's in gratitude was spurring my numbed faculties into life again. To sacrifice one's self in the cause of humanity, it appeared, was simply to beckon the hangman to one's side. By ante dating the child's last sleep by a few hours, I had saved her from untold anguish \u2014 and for this her father would reward me with a rope. When, loosing one of my hands, he stretched out his own to seize the open box that lay upon the child's breast, my arresting voice was firm enough. \" Touch that,\" I said quietly, \" and you are a dead man.\" He recoiled violently \u2014 as a giant will do, if King Death but whisper to him. I took the little case into my own hand, and turned to confront him. Even in the midst of his recoil the man had checked himself, and he now faced me with arms half-raised, like one scared by a sudden onset, but sworn to flinch no further."], [135, "A Month os Madness. 127 \" That's well,\" I said ; \" keep so if you please. But if you attempt to lay a finger upon me I'll finish you and myself too ! \" \"Who be you?\" he asked in a strange voice. \" Who be you, in God's name, to come around poisoning folks that you've never seen before ? \" My life being practically at the man's mercy, it seemed best to take him into my confidence, and if possible to win him, even partially, to my views. It was a poor chance, but the only one I had, of escaping im mediate betrayal to Philby and the other doctor. I therefore compressed into as few words as possible my scheme of mercy, as I considered it, explaining how it was to me the logical consequence of what I had been taught. \" But 'tis agen the command of the Al mighty,\" he muttered gropingly. \" I tell you there is no such person as the God whom you worship. You're"], [136, "128 A Month of Madness. clinging to an effete superstition handed down from credulous ages. There may be an Inscrutable Existence, or a Persistent Force, or something of that sort ; but there's no Person left to rule the conduct of plain men like you and me. We're free, I say, free to live our own lives, recognizing only 'our duty to our fellow-man on human grounds,' as a great authority has put it ; and to me the lessening of human suffering is the first duty of all. You propose to hang me for essaying to carry out that duty in the only way which, after years of think ing, seems to me to promise any real result.\" \" But there is a God, I tell you ! \" \" You may say so ; but of what value is your assertion in face of the great thinkers whom I mentioned just now ? \" \" Put any one of 'em in my place, and he'd say the same as I do,\" he answered in a low grim tone that seemed to burn his words into me."], [137, "A Month of Madness. 129 \" In your place ! How do you mean ? \" \" I'm sworn to do a murder, that's all.\" For the first time I recurred to Philby's half-doubtful expression as to the farmer's mental state. If, as he had hinted, there were any taint of unsoundness, the child's accident might well But here he cut short my speculations by proceeding hastily \u2014 \" I'm sworn to kill a man ; and I know \u2014 how I can't tell you, but 'tis deep down in the heart of me, deeper than hope or despair \u2014 that the deed will be an outrage upon Him who made me.

You guess the story now ? \" \" The old, old story,\" I muttered. \" I sup pose she threw herself under the waggon ? \" \" Ay \u2014 confessed it to me between her groans. But, look you, that same old story has many versions ; the use of the word 9"], [138, "A Month os Madness. 130 ' betrayal ' is sometimes no better than a piece of fooling. But 'tis the right word to use this time \u2014 'tis as black a story of treachery as ever you heard.

That's where she sinned, an' 'twas because of that sin that I dursn't comply with the poor child's wish about the doctor. I thought, somehow, that if she was to go through with it, to bear all patiently, 'twould be a set-off against her act of self-destruction. Hows'ever, the devil sent you along, and that's all past. I reckon the Evil One has you an' me pretty fast now : you've made my crime a certainty \u2014 for Rose might have lived through the trouble but for you, who knows ? \u2014 and you've got to share it!' \" I'll have no hand in your crime \u2014 though I feel much for you.\""], [139, "A Month os Madness. 131 \" I don't want your feelings.

Swear solemn to see me through with this act of retribution.\" I swore ; and with a sigh of relief he sank down beside the dead girl, and for a moment or two indulged his grief. Just as he rose, the sound of wheels and of a horse's rapid trot cleft the stillness of the evening. \" Now listen ! \" I said, going close to him, and pouring my words into his ear, \" to help you, I must be absolutely free from suspicion. Remember that I did not enter the house until after your daughter's death. You went up to fetch the Bible : returned to find her dead, and your sudden cry brought me in from the garden where I was waiting.\" Ay,\" he answered, \" never fear.\" The firm voice, suggestive of the massive strength of will that lay behind it, was like"], [142, "A Month os Madness. 134 an elixir to me. I scarcely dreaded Philby's arrival now. A moment later, the mare, panting heavily and streaked with sweat, was pulled up at the gate, and Philby sprang lightly to the ground. Even the few seconds which followed served to demonstrate the man's consummate nerve and self-possession. Every movement was rapid, perfect, exact. He seemed to be in no hurry, yet was half-way up the path with his case of instruments, before the other doctor could disentangle himself from the dog-cart. \" That's Mr. Yelland from Rushlands. You've saved him something \u2014 he loved my girl.\" After whispering this to me, the farmer turned to the door, proceeding to greet Philby with the quiet dignity of a man, grief-laden, but master of himself. \" You're too late, sir,\" he murmured, with"], [143, "A Month os Madness. 135 a solemn gesture in the direction of the couch, \"my child has been taken from me. Soon after you left her strength ebbed quite sudden-like. I was coming into the room at the time with that Bible of her mother's. She tried to speak, but there was naught but a faint moan. As I stooped over her, she passed away.\" One swift steel-glance was shot at me from Philby's eyes, but, supported by the perfect self-command of my ally, and the quiet ease of his dissimulation, I too was strong. The doctor's scrutiny left me com pletely unmoved ; there was no shadow of a tremor to justify suspicion. \" Were you in the room when this happened ? \" he asked, trying to address me without apparent eagerness. \" No ; I did not venture to intrude upon Mr. Prowse, until \" \" Ah, you heard me cry out, sir, I expect,\" put in the farmer simply, \" and I haven't"], [144, "136 A Month os Madness. yet thanked you for your kindness. Your friend, doctor, was down in the lane, await ing your return, I suppose ; he came in to me promptly and kindly when I called out.\" Philby kept those handsome, clean-cut features of his under perfect control, yet I knew that he was puzzled and disquieted, that a whirl of thought and speculation was going on beneath his calm exterior. He was playing a part, though not so skilfully as was the farmer, the depth and intensity of whose purpose had given him a power of dissembling which, even at this crucial juncture, I found time to marvel at. He seemed verily to have forgotten our existence, save when a question was put to him ; to be standing apart in the loneliness of his grief, as though no possible develop ment of human events could interest him any more. To us three, standing together thus in"], [145, "A Month os Madness. 137 hypocritical calmness, there entered the other doctor. Yelland was a simple fellow, fair-haired and ruddy, with weak kindly eyes. He entered shrinkingly, stopping short as the little scene unfolded to him its simple-seem ing story. No one spoke to him. One could see, from the single glance which Philby vouchsafed to his colleague, that he looked upon this village doctor as a person of no account. Nor did the latter regard us much, but with shuffling ungainly steps moved to the side of the couch. Then he raised the child's small hand, and I saw his tears falling. \" I loved her, Mr. Prowse,\" he murmured. \" You knew it, didn't you ? \" \" Ay, sir \u2014 I knew it well.\" \" Poor Rose ! How did the accident happen ? \" asked the honest fellow, without attempting to conceal his grief. \" Why, sir, it was the fault of Stokes, my"], [146, "A Month of Madness. 138 waggoner \u2014 or rather my fault for not dis charging of him months ago. He was the worse for liquor at the time, and gives but a confused account of it ; but it seems he was driving down One-ash hill rather fast, and, just as he turned the big corner, Rose fell from a high bank where she had been picking primroses \u2014 and rolled right under his near wheel afore he could pull up. They brought me her flower-basket and some o' the primroses that were scattered about the bank from which she fell. They're on the table yonder ; perhaps you'd like to take 'em, Mr. Yelland ? \" \" Thank you. I shall value them.\" Rose, too, had been acting ; arranging with what simple cunning she had that her suicide might bear the colour of mere accident. The humble doctor was just now the only piece of honesty within one's mental horizon. \" She died of collapse, poor thing ! \" he murmured, as he reverently gathered up"], [147, "A Month os Madness. 139 the primroses ; \" and, after Dr. Philby's account of her injuries, I'm scarcely sur prised that it was so.\" \"Collapse \u2014 no doubt,\" repeated Philby mechanically. The two medical men con ferred apart for a few moments \u2014 about the signing of the death certificate I pre sumed \u2014 and then Philby rather abruptly announced his intention of starting. He was not actually suspicious, I think, at this time, the farmer's perfectly acted simplicity having almost completely befooled him ; but there was a kind of fog in his mind which might condense into suspicion later on, and in face of which the farmer's next move struck me as profoundly injudicious. Indeed, I now perceived that the craze which pos sessed my partner in crime was likely to prove more dangerous in its workings than my own. For all his outward self-command the balance of his mind was going ; and the very strength and power of his character"], [148, "A Month os Madness. 140 would presently make its inner collapse more complete. \" I've got no one here to advise me, gentlemen,\" he now observed, \" and if you, sir\" (nodding his head in my direction), \" would be kind enough to stop on with me for an hour or two, until I get a bit steadier in my mind, I should be greatly obliged ? I could send you home later in the gig.\" What could have been more calculated to stimulate any suspicion on Philby's part than the suggestion of partnership thus con veyed ? Yet I dared not refuse the man ; to thwart him in any way might be fatal. I acquiesced mildly, with a half-surprised glance at Philby, as though to say \u2014 \"per haps I had better humour the poor fellow.\" He nodded ; and immediately afterwards the doctors drove off, leaving me alone with this quasi-madman into whose clutches Fate had thrust me."], [149, "A Month of Madness. 141 At first I was so enraged that I railed at Prowse in the Hotspur fashion of my old lost self. He listened calmly, as though all my hot talk went wide of him ; then, dropping the mask from his face, and allowing his eyes to blaze out eagerly, he asked peremptorily for my silver box. My quiet refusal to let him have this sent him, in wild haste, to the window. But the doctors were safe out of sight and sound, and before his wrath could find any other vent I was able to impress upon him the deadly properties of the little machine. Tilting it up, and so pouring its little store of wax matches upon the table, I showed him that one remained, as though glued to the bottom of the box. This match, I explained, was nothing but a cunningly contrived dummy \u2014 a tube full of deadly poison ; and the minute steel point, just visible at the end, leaped forth when the"], [150, "A Month os Madness. 142 head was pressed, like the sting of an insect, ejecting at the same time a single poison drop. The tube was, in fact, for all its diminutive size, as perfect a lethal weapon as any poisoned dagger. Further, the box was so constructed that the metal wall against which rested the point of the weapon as it lay in its groove was soft enough to give upon slight pressure. \"I see, I see,\" he said eagerly; \"a single pinch at the right place with finger and thumb, as the box lies in your hand, and you'd be in kingdom come ! And you designed the match-box as a thing that you could always carry about, and be fingering at your will, without exciting suspicion ? Well, it'll need a clever detective to take you alive, mister ! \" \" Yes ; but don't you see that a moment's carelessness would put an end to the holder of this box ?

Give me the white powder ; that'll serve me well enough.\" Feeling sure that he would ask for this, I had hoped, by going off with Philby, to win time for the preparation of an innocuous powder, to be palmed off upon this madman in place of the deadly dust ; but I was now helpless in his toils. Could I get rid of him for a few minutes, however, something might yet be done. \" You can't carry this sudden death about in a wisp of paper,\" I suggested, after a moment's deliberation. \" You had better fetch a small bottle or other suitable re ceptacle for it ?\" \"So I will, mister\" \u2014 his grim smile was like a hand upon my throat \u2014 \"and you'll go along with me ! \" If he had let himself go and blustered at me I could have borne it better, and haply"], [152, "A Month of Madness. 144 even have recovered my lost nerve. As it was, he cowed and quelled my spirit ; the deep scorn of his glance as he read my thoughts fell cold upon me ; the still and steadfast might of him as he stood carelessly leaning upon the table was like a gravestone upon my heart. Steadfast and still he seemed ; but within him, I was now well assured, was a madman's fire, ready to blaze forth at a touch, and with a madman's strength to back it. A single false step, and he would choke the life out of me with his bare hands. Overborne by his glance, I turned weakly to look at the dead face by the window, upon which the cool twilight lingered caress ingly. Of this, too, I was afraid. Fearful thoughts came crowding into my mind. The light seemed to fade suddenly from the grey face, as though the Angel of Death were overshadowing it, and pale forms to be gliding about the corners of the chamber."], [153, "A Month of Madness. 145 I heard a mutter of oaths above my head \u2014 a creeping whisper of blasphemies such as no human wretch in his agony can ever have conceived. The voices thickened and multiplied ; grew inarticulate as they became interwoven one with another. No words came now, but all the air tingled with whispering horror as I tottered across, with labouring breath and limbs unstrung, to grasp at the man whose touch a moment since I had dreaded more than death. Apparently my hallucination was intense enough to impose itself upon his mind also, for he muttered, with a low jeering laugh : \" Pretty nigh dead, are you ? Well, the room be full of devils, I reckon ; but where's the harm, ye shivering coward ? I'm not afeard myself, because \u2014 my mind's goin' \u2014 I be goin' mad, d'ye hear? \u2014 mad!\" Then, with a strange rattle of laughter, fierce and sudden as a thunder-clap, he strode from the room, dragging me with him. 10"], [154, "A Month of Madness. 146 CHAPTER VI. HEN I recovered consciousness, which had left me at the close of the scene just narrated, it was to find myself in an upstair room, with lights burning brightly. All my hallucinations vanished as my eyes opened upon this homely chamber, with its carved oak bedstead, dressing-table draped in snow-white linen, and its atmo sphere laden with the scent of old lavender. It was clearly a guest-chamber, of which the trimness and speckless purity spoke to the hospitable and civilized instincts of Blossom Farm. Surely, surely such a house as this must contain simple, wholesome folk with whom one might communicate,"], [155, "A Month os Madness. 147 and so win some way to escape from this madman's clutches ? I arose from the deep chair in which I found myself, pulsing with hope, and feeling more like my natural self than I had done since the girl's cry first drew me into the farmhouse. But my next discovery was a heart-shaking one. On trying the door, I found it locked \u2014 I was a prisoner. Further, I caught the sound of a man's heavy step passing up and down the landing outside. Well I knew whose it was. I walked back on tiptoe to the chair, and sank into it again, essaying to collect my faculties. A sickening thought struck me. I was the only living creature cognisant of his murderous design, and he already suspected my intention of thwarting it ; could he be waiting for me to awake from my swoon before killing me \u2014 shunning, as some wild beasts are said to do, to strike a victim when asleep or unconscious ?"], [156, "148 A Month of Madness. In an agony of suspense I waited, for I know not how long ; but still the leaden iteration of the tramp, tramp, fell upon my ears. At last I would bear it no more, and had risen to do I know not what \u2014 perhaps to dash myself wildly against the door, and call for help with all the voice that was left me \u2014 when the step grew slower, slower, and in a moment or two paused at the door. Some poor ghost of my lost hardihood must have come back to me while he fumbled at the lock, for as he entered I was standing firmly, poison-tube in hand, ready to fight for my life. And so I must have done \u2014 for, as after events proved, my terrified instinct had been sound enough \u2014 but for one thing ; he had not yet learned all that he wished about the proper method of using the poison. So soon as he had got possession of the drug, and knew exactly how to handle it, it would serve his interest to be rid of me ; but not till then."], [157, "A Month os Madness. 149 \" Ah, ye've recovered, I see. \" The naturalness of his tone, so strangely at variance with my expectation, was as re viving as a dash of cold water in the face. His self-possession was as perfect as it had been throughout the scene with the doctors, his frenzy had utterly departed \u2014 or so at least I thought for the moment. \"Now for the powder, mister\" \u2014 he held out a small bottle as he spoke \u2014 \"pour it in here, will 'ee ? If you've played hokey-pokey with it, why \" For a second or two he allowed his eyes to say their worst, and the folly of my hasty conclusion was apparent. \" I haven't touched it \u2014 you'll find it all right.\" I said this as indifferently as I could, while pouring the powder into the bottle. \" I hope it is \u2014 for your sake,\" he retorted, with a grim nod ; \" but I'm going to try it before you leave this room.\" \" On whom ? \""], [158, "A Month of Madness. 150 \" Don't fret yourself, mister \u2014 on a dog. Will it do in any liquid, or must it be dry ? Tell me exactly how it should be administered.\" \"Any way you like : it doesn't matter. A single grain will suffice.\" His fierce glance searched me once more ; then he turned and went, locking the door after him. Suspense again, but less poignant this time. I was now strong enough to think clearly, to pit my cunning against his. He returned unsteadily. The intoxication of rapid success had shaken him so that it was evident he had to labour hard to keep any hold upon himself. His great frame swayed as he sank heavily into a chair, muttering, \" 'Twas grand \u2014 grand !

Why should he have sent off the servants, whose presence could not possibly affect his plans as unfolded so far ? I jumped to the conclusion that, guess ing my intention of hindering by hook or crook the contemplated murder of his land lord, he meant to rid himself of me. I fully believed that he proposed to murder me at the farm, take my body with him in the gig, and throw it into the river which we were to cross. By this means he would rid him self of the only living creature who held the key of his intention and had power to thwart it. \" Well, I suppose I must go with you now, though, as you know, I would rather not.\" I said this with an air of candour which told well. \" Don't you be afeard, sir. You won't be"], [161, "A Month of Madness. 153 called upon to do the trick, for I wouldn't hand over to any one the privilege of killing him. You can sit outside in the gig, if you'll hand me over the match-box afore I go in. Your little pricker'll just meet the case, d'ye see ? I shall drive it into's open palm as I shake him by the hand. By the way, you may as well pass it over now, so as I can practise the handling on't.\" He held out his hand simply enough, and quite steadily ; but I was not to be imposed upon. \" Oh, d \u2014 n it ! \" I cried in a tone half angry, half-genial. \" You've got powder enough to poison a parish in that bottle of yours. I shall keep the box to myself.\" Not daring to meet his eyes, lest they should read the terror in mine, I could not see how he took this. Yet, despite my agitation, there was now a definite spring of courage welling up beneath my terror. At last, now that I was driven against the wall,"], [162, "A Month of Madness. 154 fairly pitted, in the arena of this lonely farm house, against the madman in whose path I stood, my manhood was coming back to meet my desperate need. I was ready to match cunning with cunning, watchfulness with watchfulness, and, when the moment should come, to strike hard for dear life. And, my brain having now cleared, there were no more hallucinations to be feared, no more ghostly whisperings to unnerve me. My adversary now turned to the door, and, striding into the passage, called loudly, \" I say, missis, be you gone yet ? \" My clanging pulses might have drowned the answer for me, had there been one ; but there was none. I was now alone with him, utterly alone, cut off from all human aid. He strode back into the room, his face doggedly set to conceal his exultation. I advanced boldly to meet him. \" The road's clear, sir, you see. We've nothing to do now but to stiffen ourselves"], [163, "A Month of Madness. 155 with a glass of brandy-grog afore we start for the Grange.\" \" All right,\" I answered readily ; \" lead the way, and I'm your man.\" \" Won't you go afore me, sir ? \" \" Oh, d \u2014 n ceremony ! \" I cried impatiently. \" I suppose you know your confounded stair cases and passages better than I do ?\" Well for me that I thus took the bull by the horns, for our way lay first along a dark passage. He went slowly down this, with the regretful step of one who thinks he is missing a chance ; most stealthily, too, for, aided perhaps by the darkness which pre cluded the necessity of keeping in check his facial muscles, the conception of the coming death-scene was now dominating him com pletely. When the clock at the stair-head before us began to strike, with its sudden burr and rattle of wheels, he started violently ; then paused, until the nine strokes were completed."], [164, "A Month os Madness. 156 That halt suggested nervousness, and so tended to encourage me. \" One of us two,\" I whispered to myself, \" has in all likelihood heard a clock strike for the last time ; but, somehow, I don't think it is I.\" Shortly afterwards there came another, and far more terrible, pause. He had proceeded noiselessly about half-way down the winding stairs, while I followed him in the same cat like fashion, when he halted again. I could just discern the massive shoulders below me, and the movement of the head as it turned. The face was no more than a blurr upon the darkness, yet I felt somehow that it had dropped its mask, that murder was now writ clear upon the features which were blank to me. Nevertheless, I could not, strike as I might, from our relative positions, have done it effectively ; there must be movement, or an open threat on his part, ere I could bring my hand to slay him. So we stood \u2014 waiting: with no sound in the"], [165, "A Month of Madness. 157 lonely house but that of our laboured breath ing, and the solemn ticking of the ancient clock. At length the head turned again, and our stealthy progress was resumed. Close to the stair-foot he paused once more ; but here a thin streak of light from the kitchen made us visible to each other ; and for me at least the strain was lessened. Moreover, a single glance down the hall showed me that the house-door was ajar : my best line of retreat was still open. With a couple of yards' start I might have made a bolt for this door at once ; but he was careful to keep within arm's length of me. \"You won't object to taking a seat in the kitchen while we drink our liquor ? \" he whispered. The mere supposition that he was still deceiving me showed how rapidly his mad ness had progressed ; it seemed incredible that, hearing his own dreadful whisper, he"], [166, "A Month os Madness. 158 did not realize the true state of the case. I could only assume that he really supposed his voice to be what he wished it, firm and natural. Yet his cunning was not altogether ex hausted \u2014 unless, as was probable enough, he was at the present moment carrying out automatically a plan conceived while his head was still clear \u2014 for a very shrewd pitfall was awaiting me. The kitchen, which we now entered, was dimly lighted ; but he ostentatiously trimmed and turned up the lamp, inviting me at the same time, and still in a husky whisper, to take a seat. I selected a chair having its back against a table, and sat down with calmness enough to impose upon him in his present condition. Then he murmured, with a rapid glance round the room \u2014 \" Kettle's here, I see, and the brandy ; but she seems to have forgotten the glasses ?\""], [167, "A Month os Madness. 159 I noticed that his glance dwelt for a moment upon the near corner of the dresser, and my sharp-sightedness probably saved my life. \" Well, make yourself at home, mister \" \u2014 there was a marked rally in his voice now \u2014 \"and I'll be back with the glasses in three or four minutes. Must find the key of the second parlour cupboard, for I reckon that fool of a woman has locked up every tumbler I possess.\" He had, in fact, stripped the kitchen of everything in the shape of a drinking vessel. With an apologetic nod, he then strode away down the passage with a step as audible as he could make it. I was to feel myself alone and free for afew moments ; but why so ? What might I be expected to do, supposing I had suspicions ? Surely to look for some weapon other than the poison-tube, which, as he knew all about it,"], [168, "A Month os Madness. 160 I could hardly take in hand without giving him warning, and which, in a tussle, was as likely to kill me as my opponent. That was what I was actually doing. I moved quietly across to the dresser upon which his glance had rested, and there lay a short, strong carving-knife. My hand was in truth stretched out for it, my fingers in the act of closing upon it, when his scheme exposed itself to me in a flash. The man's cunning appalled me. He had put himself in my place, looked at the situation through my eyes ; had thought it all out point by point. If I had taken his bait, the carving-knife, he would know that I was on the alert and so most unlikely to swallow the poison, and in that case would probably have fallen upon me from behind, and strangled me before I could raise a finger. Were he to find the knife untouched on his return he would as sume that all was well, and proceed by the safer method of poison."], [169, "A Month of Madness. 161 For an instant this discovery quite un manned me ; I stood, swaying to and fro, drawing my breath in gasps. The brandy \u2014 in that lay the only chance of steadying myself in time to face him. I felt almost certain that he was now poisoning my glass, and had left the brandy bottle alone. At any rate, I must risk it. I seized the bottle and gulped down a draught of the raw spirit. My blood flowed once more. Then, sweeping the room with a glance of agonizing scrutiny, I detected the gleam of steel on a small shelf in a distant corner. Thither I hastened with the quickness of thought, and there I saw several knives lying together, half hidden behind some plates and dishes. One of these knives was safe under the breast of my coat before his returning step became audible. I now had a serviceable weapon, and one which he knew nothing about. Upon re-entering he found me seated in ii"], [170, "162 A Month os Madness. the chair as before, impatiently drumming upon the floor with my heels. He looked hastily at both my hands, which were open for his inspection, and at the side pocket in which lay the match-box, its shape per fectly visible through the cloth. \" If you don't look sharp,\" I exclaimed, \" your landlord will decline to see us to night.\" \" All right, sir ; all right. We'll just toss off a friendly glass, then my young horse will bowl us over to the Grange in twelve or fourteen minutes.\" He then set the two glasses on the table just behind me and poured some brandy into either. His hand was now trembling with agitation, though his mouth was firm set. \" I don't think I shall drink anything, after all, Mr. Prowse.\" \" What !\" he cried savagely, with his rigid face breaking into quivering lines."], [171, "A Month of Madness. 163 \" Oh, well, sill away, as you are so press- ing ! As he reached forward for the kettle, I sauntered away to the end of the long table, which would otherwise have cut off my retreat to the door. After filling the glasses, he set one steam ing jorum down, and, raising the other, cried loudly \u2014 \" Come, now, let us drink success to the expedition !\" In a moment he thought to see me fall at his feet, and his triumphant grin made me half mad with wrath. \" Give me your glass,\" I shouted in a burst of fury ; \" take the drugged one your self, you hulking devil ! \" For one instant he was dumbfounded ; then he rushed upon me with a snarl like a dog's. I ripped the knife from under my coat, and, as he came close upon me, faced round in the doorway, offering to"], [172, "A Month os Madness. 164 stab him to the heart if he advanced another inch. As he hung back for a moment, glaring and yelling at me, I saw that the front door was still ajar, and, before he could recover himself, I had bolted down the hall, with the fresh air streaming in my face and liberty before me. Before me \u2014 but, alas, still out of reach ! The door, though open about six inches, never gave to my wrench ; it was jammed in that position by small wedges. I had fallen into another trap. I was now well-nigh as frenzied as my pursuer, whose great bulk loomed dark against the outpour of lamplight from the kitchen. Knowing that I was safe in his clutches, he was advancing slowly, quietly gathering himself up for a spring. I saw that he carried a long knife in his hand. We were now on equal terms as regards weapons."], [173, "A Month os Madness. 165 The only coign of vantage I could dis cover was the parlour doorway, into which I stepped, kicking the mat aside and plant ing myself firmly upon the boards. He could not get a fair rush at me now, owing to the narrowness of the hall. He advanced stoopingly, the knife held straight before him, his left arm bent across his chest ; then leaped forward suddenly with a fierce lunge of the steel. This swift movement drove me back against the door, which yielded to the impact of my weight. As I staggered back into the room his hoarse laugh rang out ; but I had driven my knife through the fleshy part of the arm which thrust at me \u2014 his weapon dropped from his hand, clattering down upon the boards. In a moment he had it in his hand again. But now he stood upon the defensive ; that first rally had checked his ardour. While he stood hesitating in the doorway,"], [174, "166 A Month os Madness. I had time to look about me, even to think ; for, strange to say, the moment the strain was lessened, my mind began to disentangle itself from my adversary. Thoughts began to trickle, then to flow through my brain. What was I fighting for ? my life \u2014 the broken thing that I had been yearning to renounce ? Through the window on my left a pale aftershine from the west was stealing down upon a restful solemn figure ; for on the couch, which had been drawn close into the bay, lay the child in her grave-clothes, sleeping the dreamless sleep which all save one stranger would have denied her. Why not follow her to whom I had given a repose so perfect ? The stroke of this madman's knife, driven home by his power- ful arm, were as easy an exit road as any ; and the late terror was dwindling, passing away \u2014 there was no love of life to feed it now. I would let him strike."], [175, "A Month of Madness. 167 He moved a step forward, stoopingly as before. Oh, miserable coward, I was racked with fear once more ! Let him strike ? I would fight to the uttermost verge of my strength to save myself from one steel-prick ! If he turned to flee, I would stab him from behind to make sure of him ; no particle of mercy or pity for another was left in me. I wanted safety, and would sacrifice a score of lives to save my own skin. My opponent was now cooler, therefore more dangerous, than when he first assailed me. The slight loss of blood had perhaps served to steady him. There would be no headlong rush now ; I had to deal with a foe wary, powerful, pitiless as myself. There was to be no quarter asked or given ; the little parlour was an arena in which one of us must die \u2014 a strange arena, truly, with the dead girl for sole spectator of a strange combat. Just beyond the middle space of the room,"], [176, "168 A Month os Madness. upon which fell the faint western light, I stood, knife in hand ; conscious, too, now that the moment had come, of something like an eagerness for the fray. Here was a man's work before me, a fair fight for life with an equally armed foe \u2014 something better, at least, than the thrusting of helpless women into roaring waters. Prowse now began to advance inch by inch, his eyes gleaming in the darkness. As he came into the light-patch opposite the window, I could see every detail of him. His right sleeve was drawn up to give the wrist free play ; blood was dripping slowly from the arm whose great corded muscles rose and fell with the working of his hand. Still advancing, with the same stealthy creeping motion, he paused almost within arm's length of me ; then feinted at my breast, swerved suddenly, and lunged des perately at my left side. I caught his knife with my own, but the fury of his thrust"], [177, "A Month of Madness. 169 drove the weapon from my hand. It clat tered down upon the floor just as his had done in the first encounter. But the triumph only flustered him. In stead of using his knife at once, he knocked me down with a single blow of his left fist ; then fell upon me, stabbing at random, and so driving his own steel into the boards. There leaving it, he clapped both hands to my throat. I lost all power of breathing ; death was but a matter of seconds. But as I drew up my right hand in agony, my fingers closed upon the haft of his knife ; with a last supreme effort I jerked it from the boards, and thrust it deep into his side. With a groan and a convulsive shudder, he rolled clear of me, and lay motionless just beyond the verge of the light-patch. Even as he did so, and the sense of my release from death seemed to crash into my brain, there came once more that whisper of hellish laughter, and I fell, grovelling in"], [178, "A Month os Madness. 170 terror upon the floor. It grew louder as before, swept round and round the corpse, and about the corners of the room, flickered and hissed in my ears. Sweating and shud dering, I crawled over to the couch, and laid my hands upon the crossed hands of the corpse, drawing comfort in the extremity of my anguish from the touch even of this dead human clay \u2014 because it was human. I tried to whisper to the dead girl, to im plore her pardon for the man who had tampered with her soul \u2014 stood between her and her Maker. But no whisper would come : my frozen lips were motionless. I could only cling to her until the awful whisperings died away, when I sank back upon the floor, and a sleep of utter exhaustion fell upon and possessed me."], [179, "A Month os Madness. 171 CHAPTER VII. OW ought success to act upon a man E\u2122\" \u2014 a fortnight or more of unbroken success ? It ought, I presume, to have such an effect as a friend can note with pleasure ; in which case, how came it Ned Langton had been greeting me morning after morn ing with some such words as these \u2014 \" Well, Vincent, how are you ? Why, hang me if you don't look worse again ; you seem to get thinner and more haggard every day, old boy ! \" That speech, in truth, or something like it, had latterly sprung every day to Ned's lips when Mike brought him, panting, to the head of my stairs ; and, as a rule, I had"], [180, "A Month of Madness. 172 found myself equal to turning it off with a laugh. But there came at length a morning when success appeared to cling about my spirits like a sodden garment, and I helped him to his chair in the window without a word. After a surprised look at me, he turned to his servant, saying in his ordinary tone \u2014 \" Now, you get along, Mike, and mind you come back with the chair at the proper time. If you cross the threshold of your house of call in the mean time, I'll wring your neck \u2014 remember that ! \" \" No fear o' my takin' a drain, sir,\" sniggered Mike ; \" the admiral pretty nigh blowed my head off week afore last ; an' I wouldn't go through such a rampin' roar in' thunderstorm o' cussin' again for all the liquor in the Bridge Brewery.\" \" Get along, then, and keep your thirst till to-night, when you can get drunk in peace.\""], [181, "A Month os Madness. 173 As the man disappeared, Ned turned to me with a face of concern. \" Come, old fellow, there's a screw loose somewhere; couldn't we tighten it up between us ? You give ear to all my maunderings ; let me have an innings of listening for once.\" In truth, there were so many screws loose, that the automatic machine called Hotspur Vellacott (to borrow a Yarmshaw phrase) was threatening to come to pieces. And yesterday the pains of success had been aggravated by a visit to the hotel at Shingleton-on-Sea, to which address my cousin Charles had agreed to forward my letters. A little budget was awaiting me there \u2014 a note from Yarmshaw commending my return to sanity, but cold, formal, and tinged, as I thought, with a vague distrust ; also a letter from my wife, full of tender solicitude, breathing upon me as the flower scents of Eden might have done upon the mythical Adam after his expulsion. That"], [182, "A Month os Madness. 174 was hard to bear ; yet a worse awaited me. There was a third missive, from little Lilian, full of child-spelling and home-phrases, that brought the little thing into my very presence, brought her cheek to mine, the silken kiss of her hair to my lips. After answering these, I returned to the scene of my labours in a state that might well account for my looks this morning. \"You were away all yesterday, weren't you ? \" continued Ned. \" Yes ; I went down the line again with my sketchbook, but found myself too seedy for work.\" You did not see Philby last night ?\" No \u2014 I returned late.\" \" Ah, then I have one good piece of news for you ; I met him just now, and he told me that Farmer Prowse would probably recover. You've been worrying yourself about that man, I know ? \" \"Not much,\" I answered indifferently; for"], [183, "A Month os Madness. 175 in truth I had done my best for the wounded man ere leaving him. On awaking from my sleep of exhaustion to find him still breathing, I had endeavoured to revive him ; nor had I left his side until relieved by the farm people who came about the place in the early morn ing. My conscience was now inditing of quite other matters. \" Has he recovered consciousness ? \" I asked presently. \" I'm told not ; but they seem to think his state favourable, and perhaps the blood letting may save him from permanent lunacy. I didn't understand all Philby's jargon, but gathered that the doctors wouldn't be sur prised to see him wake up sane. You may have done the poor devil a service, and, any how, there's no earthly blame attachable to you for defending your life against a mad man. They have buried his daughter, of course.\" There had been no inquest, I knew ;"], [184, "176 A Month os Madness. so one or other of the doctors must have signed the death certificate. In this one matter of poor Rose it appeared I had com pletely hoodwinked the astute Philby. The farmer, too, was safe for the present ; and, even were he to recover consciousness and sanity, they would hardly attach much weight to anything that he might put forward against me. Once more Fate, after checking me with terrible warnings, seemed to be standing aside, as though to see how far a desperate man could be driven by the devil that pos sessed him. Strange that in Ned's presence I was always a \" desperate man ; \" in his absence, an \"effective automaton.\" But for him, I should have by now become a veritable machine perfectly adapted for the attainment of my ends. His friendship, however, for which I never ceased to hunger with irra tional avidity, kept me human ; the moment his voice sounded on the stairs, the emotional"], [185, "A Month of Madness. 177 side of me woke up, my sodden conscience began to prick and burn. And stranger still, the crime which, of all others, pressed most heavily upon me just now, was that of Ned's deception. That he should be encouraged thus to blindly live in closer-growing intimacy with a \" tainted wether\" like myself, seemed an intolerable baseness. Indeed, this craze within a craze had latterly assumed such dimensions, that I perceived it must soon end in one of two things \u2014 confession or stark madness. Perhaps, when he knew all, he would turn from me (the mere mention of a \" perhaps \" in the matter may serve to give you the accurate measure of my derange ment) ; but, in any case, nothing mattered much now. I felt that I was getting near the end of my tether, rapidly approaching the terrible climax-stroke which had been in my mind from the beginning, and the nature of which, if you care to follow a stricken man to the bitter end, you will learn in due course. 12"], [186, "A Month os Madness. 178 By way of diverting me from my gloom this morning, Ned chose what, in his sim plicity, he considered an impersonal topic \u2014 not a very cheerful one, he admitted, yet hardly to be avoided, seeing that it was in everybody's mouth. At every gathering, gentle or simple, in street or market-place, in church-porch or office, drawing-room or humble parlour, nothing else was talked about. At the club it was impossible to get up a rubber of whist or a game of pool ; day or night, all the old soldiers and sailors were to be found gathered into one group in the smoking-room, discussing this one absorbing question \u2014 to wit, the epidemic of death that was now ravaging the town and neighbour hood. \"Indeed, by this time,\" said Ned, \"the whole community must be in a state of ferment and terror, for this morning again there are rumours of another batch of deaths.

They either commit suicide, or succumb without a struggle to whatever disease they happen to be suffering from. I don't know how many lives have flickered out in this way during the last two or three weeks. To begin with, there was Mrs. Grimes, whom you tried to save ; then came the affair at Blossom Farm \u2014 though, as being an accident, that hardly comes in the same category. Ever since that, by Jove, the deaths have been coming thick and fast, thicker and faster. Yesterday afternoon there was that old publican \u2014 Branding, of the Bridge Inn, I mean. He had cancer, but, according to Philby, ought to have lived a couple of months longer at least ; as also should the two consumptives in Rush Lane. Then, again, there was that old tramp \u2014 have you heard about him ? \""], [188, "A Month os Madness. 180 \" Which tramp ? \" \" she wall-eyed old rogue who has been knocking about here lately. He has been looking out for work, like all the loafers, with a little mild thieving thrown in as play, no doubt. Anyhow, our sharp little rector got hold of him, as he does of every poor devil in the parish, and persuaded one of the farmers to give him a trial at hop-pole tarring. Well, Mr. Tramp gets through one day's work, and at the end of it quietly deposits himself in the nearest pond, which happens to be in our grounds. How's that for a rum go ? But queerer still was the scrawl found in a willow stump hard by when they raked him out yester day afternoon. I saw it at the police station this morning and can give it you almost word for word. This was how it ran : \u2014 \" 'Mr. Crown er, \" ' This be a case of deliberate sooicide, so don't let your ass-headed jury bring in temp'ry insanity,"], [189, "A Month of Madness. 181 or anythink o' that I'm as sane as you be, an' more.

What a future before that race, then ! Enough of struggle left to give salt to existence ; gallant strife, wholesale emulation ; but no longer the ever-grinding mill of toil that kill the worker's heart, and puts hatred between him and his fellow.

Harsh word ? \u2014 this was all the harshness I got from Ned. \" Dear old lad,\" he said. \" I know you too well to accept your wild nonsense. Talk on, if that eases your heart ; but you can't impose upon me. There's but a corner of your brain busy with this chimera ; you're not really speaking yourself.

For instance, why do you think the letter of that poor devil of a tramp impressed me so that I could repeat it to you almost word for word ? \" I answered nothing, for my own thoughts were drowning Ned's words. I was sullenly conscious of being as much of a coward as any of my party. Ned's affection had grown too precious ; I should never rise to the point of voluntarily blackening myself in his eyes. \" Why, the truth is, I was once on the"], [197, "A Month of Madness. 189 verge of drowning myself in that same pond.

I couldn't bear myself then, and made straight for the pond, which is but a hundred yards or so from our house.\" \"Well?\" \" Estelle found me on the brink, hanging over the deep water, and drew me away.\" I could not listen to Ned further. His infatuation for this girl, the whole story of which was now familiar to me, never failed to throw me into a state of dumb rigid sulkiness. From his point of view she might be all that he declared ; but to me, though I had never yet come within speak ing distance of her, she was neither more nor less than a bitter antagonist. This Estelle seemed to be always unconsciously standing in my path, making naught of my plans for helping others, transmitting into remorse the poor scraps of comfort that sometimes fell to my lot. The rector's"], [198, "A Month os Madness. 190 influence I could counteract, as had been proved in the cases of Mrs. Grimes and of the stranger-tramp, and in many others also ; but the daughter had proved, save in one instance only, too strong for me. Once a man had come well under her influence, I could do nothing for him. There was some strange power of sympathy, or what not, about the girl, in presence of which I found myself helpless. Miss Nowell had never cared for Ned, save in a sisterly way ; his wildness, I think, had always been an effectual barrier between them \u2014 -yet no other living creature had so powerful a hold upon him. It was owing to her that he had passed from his old state of flat rebellion against Fate into one of something like humble acquiescence, which now underlay, though I was but just beginning to realize this, his mask of defiant gaiety. In truth, Ned's present condition, I should imagine, much resembled"], [199, "A Month os Madness. 191 that of poor Heine when, after prolonged suffering, he wrote to Campe \u2014 \" I have be come no pietist, but all the same I wish to play no more with the good God.\" Ned talked on about Estelle now ; and a strange contrast to my late self-revelation was this present outpouring of his. He had travelled far on my road, only to turn back ; had passed through a madness deep as mine, to find at last a patience that seemed to me inexplicable. I could only listen perfunctorily, for I dared not look too closely at the gulf that lay between his mental peace and the fierce despair which, so soon as my heat was expended, had again laid its hand upon me. Quickly perceiving, however, that his vein of talk oppressed me, Ned fell back into his old buoyant genial nonsense.

Thanks to the affair at the town-lock and the mad farmer's assault upon me, I had become too notorious for such a course. The plan could not have been carried out quietly, and in fact it became an impossi bility. Wherefore I had quickly decided to confine myself to the lower social stratum, into which, by the help of the rector and Dr. Philby, I had been introduced readily enough. How fell had been my success, and what kind of satisfaction it had brought me, you already know. Hope had left me ; fear had almost passed away with it ; my strength was failing ; I felt that I had run my course and could work no more. One final stroke \u2014 the climacteric one that had been in my mind from the beginning \u2014 I might perhaps achieve ; but even this was doubtful."], [203, "A Month of Madness. 195 Pleading illness, I had latterly declined to see any visitor. Isolation had, indeed, become a necessity of existence, since a word of friendliness from any honest man must needs, in my present state, have driven me mad. I could only endure the thought of Ned's kindness by right of the compact of confession that I had made with myself, and had sworn to carry out at our next interview. I craved but to see him once more, to feel the grip of his honest hand, to hear for one last time the old ring in his voice \u2014 then he should know all. My seclusion was, of course, imperfect. I could shut out visitors, but could not bar myself against such communications from the outer world as filtered through the people of the house. The servant would talk, though she had ceased to sing, and her speech was full of foreboding and woe. She told me that not only the sick, but in some cases the sound, were now dying of"], [204, "196 A Month os Madness. sheer terror ; that folk were now going about whispering to one another, \" Who next ? \" The outbreak of any known disease, how soever it might have ravaged the little community, would not have scared it half so terribly ; it was the sense that Death was in their midst, moving to and fro in some undiscoverable disguise, shorn of the pomp and circumstance that warn men of his approach and stimulate them to resistance, that had paralyzed them so completely. Poor old Miss Wilmington, for all her youthful health and spirits, had been so affected by the prevailing terror as to become a feeble, querulous old woman living in hourly terror of her end. Every report that was brought, every tolling bell that sounded through the empty street, every whisper of the summer breeze, as it seemed, spoke to the havoc I had wrought. Having now lost count of the days, I knew not how many had passed since Ned's last"], [205, "A Month os Madness. 197 visit ; but there had been ample time for me to get used to his absence, had that been possible. Expectation, thwarted morning after morning, must by this have lost its edge, had it been working along ordinary channels ; yet every day it grew keener, more biting. I could find no analogy for my state of intense feverish desire to get one more glimpse of him. No physical lone liness that I could conceive was comparable to the fathomless isolation of soul which was my lot. A man cast upon a desert island, cut off from human fellowship by the breadth of an ocean, would surely find some solace in the thought that physical space alone, potentially conquerable, however wide, sepa rated him from heart and voice of human kind ; but the moral gulf that surrounded my prison could nevermore be crossed. I clung with a terrible desperation to that one companion, whom a single whisper would drive across the gulf; my desire to hear one"], [206, "198 A Month os Madness. more friendly word from him was becoming a frenzy. I could not find in any \" place of my soul one drop of patience,\" save in the thought of that interview. One morning, about the hour when Ned's voice should have been sounding in the hall, and when by consequence my sick craving was at its height, I had a summons from below. Miss Wilmington sent many apolo gies, but, as she was still too unwell to mount the stairs, would I be so kind as to come down for a few minutes ? I descended at once, and thereupon found myself caught in a trap. The rector was in Miss Wilmington's sitting-room, and with him another visitor, whom for the present my eyes avoided. The little man came forward with a cordial greeting, chuckling at his own slyness. \"You must forgive our little piece of trickery, Mr. Vincent, but how else could I get a glimpse of you ? I call and call,"], [207, "A Month of Madness. 199 and hear gloomy accounts of your health, but am never allowed to penetrate into your castle.\" So he talked on for a moment or two, but I perceived that the shock produced by my haggard appearance made his tongue move stiffly. He was changed himself, too ; upon his face, as upon the face of every soul that passed my window, I could trace my handiwork. Before this pastor, whose flock I had been frightening, poisoning, worrying to death, I now stood stupidly staring, noting his saddened eye, the deepened lines of his forehead, rather than attending to what he said ; but presently the one word \" intro duce \" caught my ear, and the other visitor came forward from Miss Wilmington's sofa, over which she had been bending, and bowed to me. It was Estelle. For the moment I was too much excited to gather any impression of her outward"], [208, "A Month of Madness. 200 appearance ; I could think of her only as the able antagonist with whom I had been waging bitter, but stealthy war. How strange was the relation that knit us together ! Here was an enthusiast like myself, and in the self-same cause. We had been attacking the problem of pain from our separate stand- points, our respective teachings had been clashing at every turn. She, I repeat, not her father, had been my true opponent ; for the girl was tender as well as strong \u2014 she had gone among the pain-racked and de- spondent with a woman's heart, a man's will, and an audacity of spirit peculiarly her own. In every case, as I have said, where this girl had had time to make her mark and take her grip, my persuasive efforts had been vain. Though this was our first face-to- face meeting, we had been, metaphorically speaking, crossing swords again and again ; and in every case save one her skill of fence had baffled me. Old Josiah Branding, the"], [209, "A Month of Madness. 201 innkeeper by the bridge, was my one triumph ; he was her pet and protdgi ; I had released him in spite of her. It seemed strange that none of my failures had betrayed me, but, in truth, my craze had developed in me special powers of cunning. If, after some probing, a case appeared hopeless, I was hypocrite enough to swing round smoothly, praise the sufferer's faith and fortitude, commend the teaching of the rector and his daughter, and depart in search of a fresh quarry. And in the only case where this method had failed \u2014 sudden death had cut off the would-be betrayer. As my nerves grew steadier I fell to examining with a certain grim curiosity this girl who had so many times thwarted me. My glance fell upon a tiny figure, half a head shorter than the small parson, clad from head to foot in glistening white \u2014 by way of protest, I supposed, against the prevailing gloom of the place. The face, too, was"], [210, "A Month of Madness. 202 small, with power in it as well as beauty ; the mouth tender, but resolute ; the great dark eyes both forceful and appealing. A worthy antagonist, as I could not but admit : not one of the sweet angelic women who kiss the foot that tramples upon them ; rather one who would demand fair treatment and a fair hearing ; capable of large generosity and love, but by no means inclined to throw such pearls before swine. Meanwhile Estelle was returning my scrutiny so frankly and fearlessly that I thought her eyes must needs pierce me through and through ; but it was not so. This girl, like every other person with whom I had been brought in contact, save Philby alone, read me as being my old self, before the poison had begun to work in me. When she spoke, her quick eager tones were full of friendliness. \"We have heard so much of you from Mr. Langton, that you are hardly a stranger"], [211, "A Month os Madness. 203 to us ; so you must forgive me if I'm rather interfering. But you are ill, Mr. Vincent ; you need looking after. I have come upon your track many times lately, and all my sick people speak of your kindness ; yet I think you should go off to the seaside for a week or two, or to your own people. You are not fit to breathe the air of this grief-stricken place in your present state of health.\" \" Grief-stricken, indeed,\" put in Miss Wil mington with a lachrymose sigh. \" Ay, to be sure, ' man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets : or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken.' Mourners \u2014 mourners passing one's window all the day long : scarce a family I know out of black now. 'Tis the will of the Lord, maybe ; but I can't abear to look upon it, and the sooner I'm taken the better!\" \" Tut \u2014 tut ! \" cried the little parson cheer fully. \" It is a sad time ; but let us face the"], [212, "A Month os Madness. 204 visitation bravely, and help each other to bear up like Christian men and women.\" \"There \u2014 look there!\" moaned the poor old lady. \" Ah me, God have mercy upon us all ; but that's poor old Branding now, Miss Estelle!\" We all turned to the window, whither she was pointing. A humble funeral procession was passing along the street, now empty and lifeless, as though the plague were raging about it. It was the old innkeeper's funeral, as I could read in Estelle's eyes \u2014 the outward sign and visible proof of my one triumph over her. We both gazed at the little pro cession as it crept silently past. The girl's hands shook, and her eyes were moist, but she spoke steadily enough to Miss Wil mington. \"It is poor old Branding ; he has suffered greatly, and is now past all pain.\" \" Ay, miss ; but they do say as he killed"], [213, "A Month of Madness. 205 himself. I'm told Dr. Philby isn't satisfied about the old man's death, and says he ought to have lived two or three months more.\" \" I shall try not to believe it,\" returned Estelle, firmly ; \" indeed, I flatly refuse to believe it. He promised me faithfully and solemnly to do nothing to hasten his end.\" The rector said nothing : he evidently knew the truth. Estelle, dismissing the subject with a wave of the hand, and mastering what I could see was a natural repugnance to cowardice, gave herself up to soothing the pseudo-invalid. For myself, I felt too much stunned and bewildered to take any further part in the proceedings. Presently the little parson, after begging me to consult a doctor and give more serious attention to my health, departed upon his rounds ; thus leaving me free to return to my solitude. Yet it was difficult to leave Estelle, who seemed to have a curious power over me. I was unable either to ignore her"], [214, "206 A Month of Madness. presence or to get away from her. During this short interview with her my depression had multiplied itself tenfold. It seemed that I could not endure the contact of any clean and honest soul; for, just as with Ned, my burden had become so intolerable that I was now verging towards wild defiance of Fate. I was minded to seize the girl and hold her fast, to pour my black story into her ears whether she would or no. Had Estelle been aware of my state even her courage must have failed ; but, as I still kept my place by the window, my face was hidden from her. So we remained for a time, until Miss Wilmington had passed through the stage of feeble wailing, and was beginning to wax cheerful over the shortcomings of her dress maker ; when my antagonist left the couch side, not without a sigh of satisfaction. \" I am so interested in the friendship between you and Mr. Langton,\" she began"], [215, "A Month of Madness. 207 abruptly ; \" and I wish you would talk of it. I never saw him grow so fond of any one in so short a time as he has of you.\" I only muttered something inaudible, declining to turn round. \" He has been very ill again, but hopes to be out once more to-day or to-morrow. You'll be glad to see him ? \" \" Glad ? \" I repeated savagely ; \" what do you know of my gladness or sorrow ? You have no knowledge whatever of the man to whom you are speaking.\" She faced me as I turned, flushing with amazement at my tone. \" What of this Branding ? \" I continued jeeringly. \" He has escaped you, it seems ! You thought to keep him fast bound to the rack for a few months longer, but he has slipped from your clutches. I tell you, he poisoned himself. Some enemy came stealthily following in your track, sowed tares among your wheat, undid your teaching,"], [216, "A Month os Madness. 208 loosed your victim. He has mocked at your preaching, and has gone into painless darkness for ever ! \" \" He has gone to his Maker,\" said the girl firmly, but with tears dimming her eyes ; \"and I pray that He who has known his agony will pardon his crime \u2014 if crime there was.\" \" But who can have loosed your prisoner ? Have you no hope of discovering the traitor ? \" So far I had proceeded, when a sudden change in Estelle's look and manner checked me. She made a hasty gesture as though to deprecate her late warmth of temper, and, coming close enough to lay a hand upon my arm, said appealingly \u2014 \"I set myself up for a nurse, yet lack the first requisite for nursing \u2014 decent com mand of temper. Do let me speak to you as a real sick nurse now. I know there is some secret illness preying upon you.\""], [217, "A Month of Madness. 209 \" 'Tis just the prevailing despair that has gotten hold of him,\" murmured the invalid on the couch ; \" and no wonder, for every one speaks of his pitifulness.\" \" Nonsense ! \" retorted Estelle sharply. \" I won't have that ugly word ' despair ' mentioned at all. Have you no relation who would come and look after you, Mr. Vincent ? \" \" I am utterly alone in the world.\" \" Oh, I'm so sorry ! \" The sympathy of the girl's eyes and voice so unhinged me \u2014 for I was now a mere straw blown hither or thither by every breath of emotion \u2014 that I was half beside myself. When her hand stole out again to touch my arm, I shook her off roughly, crying in a broken voice \u2014 \" Don't touch me ; I'm a wretch not fit to stand in your presence ! \" She thought I was veritably raving, and for a moment seemed nonplussed and 14"], [218, "A Month os Madness. 210 frightened ; but speedily regained her self command. \" Come, Mr. Vincent,\" she said quickly, \" you must calm yourself. You should go up to your room and lie down quietly, and Miss Wilmington shall send you up a cup of coffee. In case Mr. Langton does not appear soon, I shall insist upon sending some other friend to see you.\" Then, as I wandered away to the door, she turned to the trembling old woman \u2014 \" Now, Miss Wilmington, there's nothing to be alarmed about ; tell me more about that new silk mantle \u2014 all such things are interesting to us women, are they not ? \""], [219, "A Month of Madness. 211 CHAPTER IX. HAD not long regained my room when I heard Mike's familiar knock at the front door \u2014 familiar, yet now most strange ! It was the last time I should ever hear that knock, and lean out of the window to wave my hand as poor old Ned was helped out of his chair. The necessity of confession had laid itself upon me in such wise that there could be no more procrastination. I knew that, so surely as I lived and breathed, Ned and I were going to clasp hands to-day for the last time. I wondered dully how this craze within a craze had taken so firm a hold upon me ; it was though in some corner of"], [220, "A Month os Madness. 212 my charred soul one strong flame of desire still burned \u2014 of craving to wipe out that one stain of Ned's deception. Some small easement of my burden might come of this confession, the one difficult act of honesty might make me feel human again ; but, whether such a hope were vain or no, he must be told all. It would take but few words to undeceive him and let him know the worst, for all the remaining power of my soul would be in them. The perfect inevitableness of what was coming even carried with it a kind of dim happiness ; for, knowing that I was strong to face the worst, utterly resolved to face it, I could afford for a brief space to warm myself at Ned's heart fully and freely. \" Well, old fellow,\" he now began, as his man carried him into the room, \" how are you ? I'm as fit as a fiddle myself, though I've been too full of cricketing engagements to look you up lately.\""], [221, "A Month os Madness. 213 \"Good Lord!\" muttered Mike, \"what'll he say next ? \" But it was well to meet Ned half-way when the reckless mood was upon him. I returned his greeting in like vein. Ned almost fainted when we got him into the armchair, though he jeered at his own weakness. He was greatly altered for the worse ; his cheeks were more sunken, his great dark eyes looked out of deeper hollows. He was so near death that my confession could rob me of but little of his company. \" You treat me like a d \u2014 d old woman in an almshouse,\" he grumbled, when I pro ceeded to lay cushions for him and to pour out his draught of elixir. I then nodded a dismissal to Mike, and, as soon as he had closed the door, drew my chair up close to Ned's. Once more we were in our old position, looking forth into the street, as we had done day after day since our first meeting."], [222, "A Month of Madness. 214 \" I have news for you, Ned : I've seen the wonderful Miss Nowell.\" \" Have you ? \" he exclaimed, with a sudden change in his whole aspect. \" Now what a beast I am to be cursing and swearing on the brink of the grave ! She isn't in the house now ? \" \"Yes; she is below with Miss Wilming- ton.\" \" I'm sorry to hear it. She must have seen me hauled in by Mike, which would certainly distress her. And I'm sorry I swore so hard as he shoved me up the stairs.\" \" She's a strange girl, Ned, though I admit her fascination.\" \" Strange indeed ! She can make a man repent without ever mentioning his sins. Lucky for her that she never cared for me, Vincent ; and lucky for me, too, I think, for as it is I can bear to die without being so deuced sorry for myself. I can't talk"], [223, "A Month os Madness. 215 about this to any one except you ; but here we are, you and I, a pair of old crocks without a shilling's worth of vital force between us, who can afford to speak of the end of the innings. My poor old dad can't bear to think of my taking off my pads and laying down my bat \u2014 and I hope he won't be present at the operation. I should like to die here, old boy, in your armchair, with \u2014 yes, with her to give me a smile at the finish. Pity we can't bring off the event now that she's below ! But somehow I always feel stronger here : the sense of freedom is vitalizing ; there's no one to be humbugged, no need to wear a mask. Jove, how dead the little street looks ! And hark, there's another tolling bell just beginning ; that's the tin kettle of the iron chapel just below the river. There's another poor devil dead of fright, I suppose ? By-the-by, have you heard the last new theory as to the mysterious plague that's"], [224, "A Month os Madness. 216 raging ? They seem to think there's some scoundrel going about among the sick, and either scaring them to death or poisoning them by some undiscoverable process. I thought Philby was too sharp a man for such mare's-nest hunting ; but he's the theorist, they tell me. He is a cousin of our member, Sir Clive Rawson, and has been up at The Towers several times lately to meet that queer northern M.P. \u2014 can't remember the man's name at this moment ; but anyway I expect the three have been putting their heads together, and this detective is the outcome of their palaver.\" \" Detective ? \" \" Yes \u2014 there's one now in our midst, ready to nose out the mare's nest and lay the mythical murderer by the heels. He came down yesterday and is lodging just opposite you, at No. 5, on the first floor \u2014 behind that little window garden, do you see ?\""], [225, "A Month os Madness. 217 \" What is he like to look at ? \" \" Oh, a common sort of fellow, with pallid face and long black whiskers ; looks like a commercial traveller, and is to pass for such, I believe. However, I was told all this by a friend who swore me to secrecy \u2014 I had forgotten that. They make a mighty to-do about this mysterious bogie-man, I can assure you ; but in any case there's no harm in speaking of him to a hermit like you, old boy\u2014 you re not likely to interfere with their new bloodhound ! \" \" Why are you so dead against Philby's theory ? Do you forget the tramp's letter, which you repeated to me ? \" \" That went for nothing. I understood the man's state perfectly, having often felt like that myself. Depend upon it, he was a wild dog who wanted no persuasion to suicide ; he was his own counsellor, his own judge, his own executioner. Look, here's actually a moving object on the road ;"], [226, "218 A Month of Madness. some one is at last going to invade our City of Death ! It's a tandem-cart, and I recog nize that bright bay in the shafts. Only Sir Clive drives such cattle. Look at the beauties ! \u2014 isn't it a pleasure to see such life and dash after all the dreary funerals ? That's Sir Clive driving, with his friend beside him, I see. Ah, now I remember the man's name \u2014 it's Yarmshaw, and he's member for North Lingshire. There's Philby sitting behind them \u2014 the whole con clave, you perceive. They've driven in to interview the new-comer, no doubt \u2014 the detective-commercial.\" My heart throbbed painfully, but my nerves were steady ; I felt ready for any emergency. My enemies were closing in, working steadily up to their quarry : I might be hunted down, for all I knew, within the hour. It seemed fitting that the pursuers of my life \u2014 that grim and fearful jest that was now so nearly played out \u2014 should be,"], [227, "A Month os Madness. 219 on the one hand, my quondam friend whose persistent teaching, acting upon my weaker parts, had induced thte craze for which I was to die ; the other, one who, had he been cursed with human sympathy, must, logically speaking, have applauded my crimes. How much did they know ? Upon that question hung the fragment of a future that was left me. I might have but a few hours to live, or a few days ; and, but for that climax stroke at which I have hinted, it would have mattered little either way. Yet, now that there was so palpable a danger of immediate capture, my lessening desire to accomplish this was suddenly intensified. And I had this advantage over my enemies ; they would think me unsuspicious, ready to be trapped, whereas, thanks to Ned's revelation, I should be watching their every movement. \" Hullo ! there's the detective at the window,\" cried Ned, suddenly. \" Now, I'll give them an excuse for pulling up, and we"], [228, "20 A Month of Madness. 220 shall see whether any signals pass between the confederates. It will be quite a little comedy, eh ? \" Ned leaned out of the window and waved his hand to Sir Clive just as the leader came within a few lengths of the house. Sir Clive pulled up sharply almost abreast of us. I watched intently, sheltered by the muslin curtains. Sir Clive hailed the window in a loud cheerful voice. \"Well, Ned, how are you getting on ? Haven't seen you about lately ; was afraid you were laid up again.\" Ned answered in his usual fashion, and so they talked on for a few minutes. I could hear no more of their dialogue, for Yarmshaw was before me ; so near, indeed, that I could have tossed a biscuit on to his knees. Here was the friend for whom I had fought at school ; who had, by his innate"], [229, "A Month os Madness. 221 power, and without thought of malice, brought my life to such fearful shipwreck. He looked as steadfast, as haughty, as immobile as ever. Upon his straight firm profile was written the old contempt for the world of automatons around him. Yet I thought he seemed a little worn ; wearied, perhaps, by the in soluble problems among which he lived. Did he guess that I, his ancient comrade, was the mysterious criminal to whose capture he was committed ? And, if so, would any memory of old times give him pause ? I thought not. I seemed to be gauging, for the first time in all these years, the hidden depths of this man. To my wife's vehement assertions of his fundamental coldness and hardness I had always replied with as vehement declarations as to the heart-warmth which he concealed so effectually. Now it was borne in upon me that she had been right \u2014 in this, as in all things. The icy chambers of the man's heart and intellect"], [230, "A Month os Madness. 222 seemed at length to lie open to my gaze ; and his juxtaposition with Philby, who occa sionally turned on his seat to exchange a word with him, seemed to emphasize this new-born clearness of vision. For I had often mentally compared these two, affixing to both the same fancy label, whereas I now perceived that they differed at the core. Philby had enthusiasm, mainly intellectual, perhaps, but very real ; he was capable of sacrificing himself to science, of slaving in a garret or risking his life to make a dis covery. Again, though narrow-hearted, and somewhat ruthless in the pursuit of his healing art, he was not without natural affections ; while Yarmshaw was a man with no bowels \u2014 one who had never smiled upon a child, or caressed his mother willingly. So, at least, I thought \u2014 though God knows how savage a bitterness consumed me as I stood building up my indictment against the man who had ruined me."], [231, "A Month os Madness. 223 I thought Philby exchanged a nod with the detective, but I could not be certain. Nor did I concern myself much on this head; for something told me that my confession to Ned would actually take place to-day, and that to-night the climax would be achieved \u2014 and, for the rest, I had no care, no hope, no wish. \" Odd fellow, that Yarmshaw,\" muttered Ned, as the trap drove off, \" and the queerest part of him is that he reminds me of you ! I can't make it out, for you're not in the least alike. He has extraordinary ability, they say, and would be Prime Minister some day if he had but human weakness enough to throw in his lot defi nitely with one party or the other. Have you ever heard him speak in public ? \" \" Many times.\" \" Well, what do you think of him ? Do you agree with the general voice in calling him one of the greatest of our living orators ? \""], [232, "A Month of Madness. 224 \" The greatest, Ned, in some directions. His tongue is like a hammer, one stroke of which will crush your noblest aspiration or highest ideal to powder.\" \" So others tell me ; but I differ from you all. Now I remember hearing him speak once to a Yorkshire audience in support of a local candidate at a bye election. He made an extraordinary speech, which yet somehow chilled one to the bone ; he never got a cheer, the listeners were dead as so much frozen meat. The local candidate looked pretty blue, I can tell you ; but in the midst of the icy silence a man who sat next to Yarmshaw on the platform got up \u2014 a man named Veil \u2014 something. Vellacott, that was it. Hotspur Vellacott they called him, and a hothead he proved to be. Gad, he soon warmed them up ! Began by saying he couldn't let some of his friend Yarmshaw's destructive statements pass without comment, then slanged his friend into heaps. Praised"], [233, "A Month of Madness. 225 him all the time, too \u2014 it was the queerest performance ! They roared and laughed, and cheered him to the echo. So did I, though he was a beastly Radical \u2014 I couldn't help myself. The man was so hot and reckless, yet somehow so generous. I've heard a lot about him since : he's immensely rich, and gives away thousands in charity ; has done more for the London hospitals, I've heard, than any man of our time. I liked that fellow, and couldn't help going up to shake hands with him afterwards, though I told him candidly how I hated his political principles. Ah, now I know why Yarmshaw reminded me of you a few minutes ago ; you're like Vellacott, with whom the other man is asso ciated in one's mind \u2014 not so strong or straight ; much thinner and older ; but still like him. You might be Vellacott's first cousin. Have you ever come across him ? \" Here, as it seemed, was the noblest of 15"], [234, "A Month of Madness. 226 opportunities. Hotspur Vellacott, the philan thropist, might perchance teach Ned to accept, as a human creature, Hamo Vincent, the criminal ; the consummation for which I had yearned with an ever-waning hope might even yet be achieved \u2014 Ned might almost bring himself to hear my black tale through without turning from me in utter hatred and loathing. But for his sake I must needs withhold the stroke yet a short time longer : for his eager talk had exhausted him ; he fell back now, faint and white, and well-nigh pulseless. It was almost a pleasure to me to have him thus for a few moments. He was help less as a sick child in my hands ; for this one last time I could minister to him without offence, as to my friend and brother. Poor old Ned ! \u2014 to force the truth upon him now that he was resigned, at peace with all men, and with, in all probability, a quiet end await ing him in so many hours, were surely a"], [235, "A Month os Madness. 227 gross barbarity ; but, as I have said, I was fate-driven, and he must suffer with me. As I crouched forward in my chair, watch ing his slow rally from the faintness, it seemed as though the earth were passing out of its course into some space of darkness, falling away into some remote outer region ; while the sun's warmth grew fainter and fainter, and his light waned, and the weary voices of men sank to whispers, and all living things began to sink and droop, and to grope feebly about for some place to die in. From this waking dream Ned's voice aroused me suddenly. \" I'm much better, Vincent \u2014 all right again \u2014 almost. What were we talking about when the weakness overtook me ? \" \" You feel really stronger, Ned ? Drink this dose. There, now I can allow you to talk.\" \" What has come to your voice, dear old boy? It's like some tender woman's. Did you think I was dying ? \""], [236, "228 A Month os Madness. \" No ; but I have to tell you a story that will pain you ; and it hurts me to do that, Ned.\" \" A story ! \u2014 about whom ? \" About the man you call Hotspur Vella- cott.\" I had pulled down the last barrier \u2014 nothing stood between me and my con fession now. I looked long at Ned, drink ing in the last brother-glance that his eyes would ever give back to mine. \" Ned, has it ever struck you that I set a strange value upon our friendship \u2014 an almost unnatural one, seeing that it has lasted barely a month ? Do you see nothing abnormal, overstrained, about my clinging to you in this fashion ? \" \" Well, to be perfectly frank, it does seem odd ; though, on the other hand, I'm more or less tarred with the same brush.\" \" You think so ; yet, in plain truth, the strength of your affection is to mine as a"], [237, "A Month os Madness. 229 giant's clutch to a pigmy's, because your state is normal ; mine is not. My hunger for human kindness is like a starved animal's for food.\" Already I saw in Ned's face something I had never seen before\u2014 the handwriting of fear. I seemed to be raving ; and the thought, which now perhaps assailed him for the first time, that I was really mad, brought alarm and repulsion with it. Most naturally, even inevitably ; yet none the less did my heart sink. If a single wild sentence, having a tincture of madness about it, could affect him thus, what must I look for later on ? He might wish to kill me before I could finish the tale of my crimes \u2014 as a piece of human vermin, to spare whom were a cruelty to others. If so, he should have my full leave to strike ; most gladly would I die by Ned's hand. Nevertheless, I was resolved first to plead my cause to the utmost of my ability. I would compel him to hear me, to"], [238, "A Month of Madness. 230 feel in some measure with me, to realize the height and depth of my despair as no other would ever do ; for, whether I lived or died, I would never more offer excuse or palliation to any human being. So deep-rooted was my desire to set my case fairly before this, my chosen judge, that I had power to command the tumult of my senses. In spite of bounding pulse and straining nerve, I could force myself to speak smoothly and quietly \u2014 at least during the first stage of my narrative. Ned's slight knowledge of my old self and of Yarmshaw helped me materially at the outset. I told him that I was intimately acquainted with Vellacott, and wished to speak of him at length. My very quietude, maintained so rigidly, yet by so obvious an effort, impressed my listener at once. He heard with close attention the story of that earlier Hotspur, which has been scarcely touched upon in this narrative; of"], [239, "A Month os Madness. 231 his first stirrings of sympathy with human pain, and of its gradual development into a craze or passion ; of how, under the double influence of this craze and of Yarm shaw's crushing negations, the man was driven hither and thither as by furies ; and lastly how a final stroke was dealt to his staggering senses by the discovery that he was a doomed man, with but a few weeks left to wrork in. \" You mean that Vellacott went mad, then ? \" said Ned at this point. \" Not so ; he would flady refuse to make any such plea for mercy. The soul of him may have been distraught, but he had not, and has not now such physical disease as strips crime of its guilt.\" \" He's still alive. I suppose, for I've seen nothing of his death in the papers ? \" \" Still alive ; and suffering.\" \" Why ? \u2014 why ? What has he done ? \" Ned's cheek was flushing, his eyes shining"], [240, "A Month os Madness. 232 with uneasy light. \" I can't make you out to day, Vincent : you talk as though you \" \" As though I were the man himself.\" He half-rose from his chair, with a quick fearful glance at me. I answered the glance immediately \u2014 \" No, I'm not out of my mind, but as sane and coherent as you are. You are to be my judge \u2014 that is an old resolution of mine. You have to judge me whether you like it or not ; and I scorn to claim the privileges of a lunatic. No madman would speak to you as I am doing now ; and I solemnly declare to you that my name's Henry Vellacott, not Hamo Vincent.\" At this point Ned fell back again suddenly, dumb and rigid with amazement. \" I can easily convince you, for I perfectly remember that meeting in Yorkshire where Yarmshaw spoke first and I followed him ; and how, when you came up to me, you said, \u00ab I hate your d \u2014 d Radicalism, but"], [241, "A Month os Madness. 233 you're a good sort in spite of it. Shake hands, Mr. Hotspur!' Then do you re member my retort : ' You're a Hotspur yourself; I can see it in your eyes'? I had a vague sense of recognition when I first saw you in your chair down here, and small wonder that it went no further. Suffer ing has changed you ; while, as for me, I hardly know my own face in the glass.\" \" But why, for God's sake, have you been masquerading in this place as a poor landscape-painter ? Can you explain that ? \" \"That is what you have yet to learn.\" \" I can't believe you, Vincent ! Either you're suffering under some delusion, or you're playing off some cursed joke upon me, which \u2014 would be quite unlike you.\" \" Will you look at this bundle of letters ? You see they are all directed to me in Spain, re-directed to Shingleton-on-Sea. You will readily guess now the object of my supposed sketching excursions down the line. Will"], [242, "A Month os Madness. 234 you do me a last favour, Ned, and read this \u2014 my little daughter's last ? \" Ned took the letter mechanically, without relaxing his puzzled frown. As he read, the little thing's child-phrases brought the glint of a smile to his eyes. \" Before going further,\" I continued, \" I wanted you to realize that you have not been utterly mistaken as to the character of Hotspur Vellacott. A brutal or heartless man, look you, would never have received such a letter from any child. The love you get from a child is only the reflection of your own \u2014 you know that ? \" \" Psha ! everybody knows what a soft hearted fellow this Hotspur is. And your way of holding the child's letter, of caressing it with your eyes, is very significant. You're convincing me, though only gradually.\" But I could not pass from the topic im mediately ; I had to linger for a few moments over my lost home and little children. Ned"], [243, "A Month os Madness. 235 changed again as I did so ; his glance softened as he listened. Then I tore myself from that brief resting place ; and at once the waters seemed to close over me. I had looked for a straining up-hill task, but it proved to be more : rather a cleavage of thick black waters that clogged my limbs and choked my breathing. For a time I could not see Ned, could see nothing around me ; and unburdened myself of each slow sentence as though by a prodigious muscular effort. I was conscious only that the will force, built up through the weary days during which Resolve had been at work, must not slacken for a moment, and that I was fighting such a battle against nature as I should never be called upon to fight again \u2014 could never fight again unless I were born anew and with superhuman powers. At length I found myself climbing"], [244, "236 A Month os Madness. upwards ; there came an easing of the strained heart \u2014 I breathed and saw once more. Ned was now lying before me, inert and rigid ; his cheek grey as ashes. But his drawn face showed that my story was eating its way into his brain, that the first stage of it had already opened for him the terrible vista of what was to come. I could hear my own words now ; I was upon the brink of the lock, allaying the terrors of my first miserable victim. The words came quickly enough, had probably done so from the first ; the slowness must have been an illusion brought about by intense strain. Swiftly and smoothly, with out misplacing a word, I went through my duologue with Mrs. Grimes. Ned shivered through his length when she mounted on to the lock-arm. But he had not yet realized my guilt to the full. When I came to the final thrust"], [245, "A Month os Madness. 237 which sent her headlong into the roaring waters, he gave vent to a low snarl of indignation. When I plunged in after her, he shivered again, working himself from side to side. His distress was terrible to me. My intense pity for the woman, my craze of humanity, my awful crime, together made a chaos of his mind. A plain confession of murder from any ordinary motive, leaving him free to hate and denounce me, would have been as nothing to this. He knew not at this moment whether to loathe or to pity me. But I could spare neither him nor myself now. The labour and strain of the begin ning were gone ; the tide of confession, now that I was launched upon it, bore me away like a straw. Without a moment's pause I was hurried along into the scene at the farm. With such words of fire as have never come to me before or since, I painted the anguish of poor Rose, as she lay, with"], [246, "A Month os Madness. 238 the mocking peace of eventide around her, awaiting the return of her executioner ; the mingled joy and fear that my first promise of relief evoked ; the sudden passing of the pain and the terror when my powder touched her lips. I was bearing Ned with me now ; for the moment the spell of my intense conviction had taken firm hold upon him, profound compassion for the girl, born of my fierce eloquence, had submerged his mind \u2014 he uttered a sigh of relief when Rose ceased to breathe. My encounter with the farmer, too, excited and inflamed him ; his heart seemed as warm wax in my hands. A strange mad triumph possessed me, there was a sound of clanging bells in my ears. I would yet take him with me to the end ; he should not turn from me \u2014 I would yet bear one good wish of his with me into the Infinite Unknown towards which we were both hastening. Vain fool! frenzied by my own eloquence, I"], [247, "A Month os Madness. 239 thought to crush with arguments the deepest instinct of man's higher nature, to scatter with a storm of words that God-sent abhor rence of murder which is the very core and marrow of his conscience. Yet the madness was short-lived ; for, just as in the actual enactment my despair had deepened as event succeeded event, so now in the narra tion I found myself plunging ever deeper into the morass. After the scene at Blossom Farm, my story, from being the fierce out pouring of a zealot, degenerated into the wail of a lost soul. As I passed once more from door to door among the sick and struggling, pouring my subtle poison into the ear of each selected sufferer, I slunk away from Ned, and, with lowered head, muttered forth the black remainder of my history. Nothing was suppressed, nothing exaggerated, nothing excused. Every sen tence carried conviction with it ; every nerve and muscle of Ned's frame proclaimed that,"], [248, "A Month of Madness. 240 as his belief in the story deepened, so did his loathing of the narrator. At length I ceased ; and, turning, caught the damning verdict of his eyes. He raised one trembling hand in condem nation as his dry lips muttered hoarsely \u2014 \" A devil in human shape \u2014 unfit to live, unfit to breathe the same air with men who have souls ! . . . Oh, you're mad, mad',' he groaned after a pause ; \" for God's sake, admit it, then I can bear to speak to you ! \" \" You know well that I'm not mad. My crimes have been the logical outcome of my views, and no madman was ever logical.\" \" What's the good of logic, when your premiss is a lie ? I say your views spring from the most accursed lie that ever one man breathed into the ear of another. . . . Why have you not numbered me among your victims ? You've seen me suffer ; where has your logic been in my case ? \" \" I couldn't, Ned,\" I cried brokenly. \" I"], [249, "A Month of Madness. 241 love you as a brother. I couldn't touch a hair of your head ! \" \" I think you've \u2014 killed me now. ... I feel myself going.\" My heart stood still as I looked at Ned, and saw that it was so. An ashen pallor was overspreading his face ; he could scarcely draw his breath. Knowing that he would take nothing from my hand, my decision was made at once. In a moment I was at the stair-head calling loudly to Miss Nowell. She answered at once, but was too late to see him alive. I turned back into the room, only to find that I had added one more to my list of victims. The poison of my narrative had killed the only one to whom I had dared offer no other means of death. 16"], [250, "A Month os Madness. 242 CHAPTER X. URELY that last delusion of mine was the strangest of all that I had laboured under ? The supposition that any possible easement to myself could issue from an avowal of my crimes, or that Ned could by any possible means be cajoled into condo nation of any one of them, surely marked the spring-tide limit of my craze. What had come of the outpouring for which my sick mind had craved ? Ned Langton's denunciation of me, springing hot from his heart, as \" a devil in human shape ; unfit to live ! \" That, coming from the mouth of one who had been to me as a brother, who had felt"], [251, "A Month os Madness. 243 the pulse of my despair, and listened to every word of my impassioned appeal, must be taken as a final verdict. Nothing more merciful could ever be extracted from the race for whose sake I had mocked and out raged my Maker through four long weeks of crime. I was finally established as a tainted wretch, fit only to be hunted down, torn in pieces, and trodden into a dunghill. As I lay on my bed, with such thoughts as the above trickling through my conscious ness \u2014 for my brain would only work at intervals \u2014 I laughed aloud. I had become heartless and soulless. I was no longer a human creature. Even Ned's death was nothing to me now ; he had died, for me at least, at the moment when his glance first damned me. Not a look, containing the least hint of human kindness, had he given me after that. Later on I had heard, quite unmoved, his father's first cry upon catching sight of Ned's dead body ; and the tramp"], [252, "A Month os Madness. 244 of the men who had come to carry it away. I had not even cared to deaden the sound by closing my bedroom door. When I had been lying thus for many hours, sometimes thinking, sometimes with my mind blank as the wall at which I gazed, I became conscious of a slight leaning to wards movement. It might be that I had lost power to stir a limb, and, in truth, it scarcely seemed worth while to put this to the proof ; but as the inclination became a little more pronounced, I made a sudden effort, lifted myself into a sitting posture, and slowly lowered my feet to the ground. I could just stand without the help of a chair. After a brief pause I found myself strong enough to totter towards the door, and so across the small landing into my sitting-room. The room was a blaze of red, as though stained with blood. At first I could not realize that this"], [253, "A Month os Madness. 245 seeming stain, which lay upon every object before me, was a natural effect ; my hair bristled at the thought that the blood of my many victims had risen from the earth to bear witness against me. But the sharp stroke of terror quickly restored the use of my faculties. I perceived that the little chamber was filled with the ruddiness of a flaming sunset. While I rested, propping myself against the door-post and breathing heavily, I heard the sound of voices below. There was a man in colloquy with my landlady. He seemed to be just leaving the room ; his firm strong tones, rising up the staircase, were loud in my ears. I had never heard the voice before, but an indefinable sense of danger stole upon me. Though I strove hard to collect myself, it was impossible to do more than listen stupidly ; nothing like a plan or theory of escape would form itself in my mind. \" Don't you move, ma'am. I wouldn't put"], [254, "A Month os Madness. 246 you out for worlds,\" said the strong voice ; \"but, if you're agreeable, I'll just look in upon the gentleman, and maybe he'll let me cast an eye over the rooms. I shouldn't keep him three minutes.\" There was a heavy tread upon the stairs. My heart sank low, my flesh trembled ; but I could neither move nor think. The man cleared his throat as he mounted. By that sound alone \u2014 for he had been strong enough to keep his speaking voice perfectly steady \u2014 I knew that his nerves were strung to a high pitch. I was still leaning, motion less, against the door-post when he stepped upon the landing. \" Beg your pardon, sir,\" he began, with an awkward bow, \"but your landlady she tells me there's some thought of your leaving these apartments. She says you're out of health, and your friends are trying to get you away. Well, I'm looking out for rooms myself, not being comfortable where I am,"], [255, "A Month os Madness. 247 and I thought, maybe, you'd let me have a look round these ? \" For all the man's will, his voice grew husky during the delivery of this brief speech. \" Certainly,\" I answered mechanically. \" Will you walk in ? \" As he stepped across my threshold the gush of crimson light struck full upon him. He was pale-faced and wore black whiskers ; false ones, as I could see at a glance \u2014 false as his commercial appearance. My visitor was Yarmshaw's detective. No coward would thus have ventured into my den alone. Yet, brave man as he was, when he found himself shut up in that little upper chamber with the mysterious murderer who had wrought such havoc in the community, whose poisoning methods none had been able to fathom, his nerve failed him. He glanced wistfully through the window in a way which, had I needed a warning, would at once have supplied it."], [256, "248 A Month os Madness. Following his glance, I noticed two police men plodding slowly up and down the pavement. A third man, dressed in plain clothes, and apparently engrossed in the contents of a shop window, I felt instinctively to be a confederate. My visitor had come, then, not merely to reconnoitre my strong hold, but to effect a capture ? In this rapid procedure I detected Yarmshaw's hand. Awake now to the full sense of my extreme peril, I found my powers returning to me, the blood once more pouring through my veins. It had been my intention, if let alone, to give myself up : I might yet do so \u2014 -in my own time, when my last work was accomplished \u2014 but I would be hunted down like a mad dog. My old powers were indeed returning to me, but not my old self; my hand was now against every man, as every man's against me. Even the catastrophic finish to my career which I had planned seemed now to be"], [257, "A Month os Madness. 249 poor and inadequate. It was to have con sisted of a great rescue, but it now came into my mind in the guise of a great revenge \u2014 and at the same time it flashed back into my memory that to-morrow was the day. Absorbed in my confession, I had for gotten that to-morrow was to be the great Thursday at Springwells Infirmary. I knew the place well ; Philby had several times taken me over there. I knew that on this Thursday Sir Francis Singleton, the great surgeon, was coming down to conduct a great batch of operations, and my old intention had been to put every one of his intended victims out of the way by means of my poison-tube. Well, if I escaped to night I would yet do so \u2014 not now out of compassion for the sufferers, but to gratify my spite against mankind at large. Ay, let me once get free, and safely over the five or six miles that separated this town from Springwells, and I would burn the"], [258, "A Month of Madness. 250 infirmary to the ground with every soul in it rather than miss my aim. As my courage rose, my visitor's oozed away. He seemed to read his approaching doom in my face, or to drink in the im pression of it from the blood-red atmosphere of the room ; yet he strove manfully against his fears. A month ago, had the same crisis arisen, I should, if only out of respect for his courage, have mastered him by superior strength \u2014 for he would have been as nothing in my hands \u2014 and drugged him off to sleep while I made my escape. Now I had no thought of sparing him. The man stood in my path \u2014 and he must die. With clenched hands, and eyes not daring to leave mine for an instant, the doomed man edged towards the window. I began thereupon to soothe him by talking uncon cernedly about the rooms, and about Miss Wilmington's good nature. He at once showed symptoms of recovery, answering"], [259, "A Month of Madness. 251 thickly, yet with growing confidence. But, after this brief respite, I threw him into a cold sweat again by proffering the flask of whisky which stood upon the table. He shuddered visibly, anxiously apologizing for his refusal. I now began to see the game that he had hoped to play. He had thrown away what would seem to have been his best chance \u2014 an immediate attack upon first entering the room. He might then have dashed his fist through the window as a signal to his myrmidons, and have held me at bay while they rushed to his rescue. But I now felt sure that, his special aim being to take me alive, he meant first to secure my box of poison ; whose existence he had become aware of by some means or other, but whose precise properties, unfortunately for himself, he had yet to discover. Such, at least, was my sur mise \u2014 and it met with a speedy confirmation."], [260, "A Month os Madness. 252 To make more sure of the man, I en couraged him again ; and, taking a seat at the table, drank a little whisky, at the same time inviting him to be seated also. Concealed by the table-cloth, and close to my hand, was a small drawer, in which lay my revolver. He refused, with an apologetic smile, to sit down, but changed his mind as to the liquor ; though, even while drinking it, he watched me intently. I next proceeded to pull out a cigarette case and my silver match-box. His glance leaped hungrily to the latter, and his face began to clear. I waited to see how he would get possession of it. His face was now flushed and eager; it was apparent that his pluck and confidence were quite restored to him. Still talking, I lighted a cigarette, leaving the match-box open upon the table. His eyes blazed with hope. \" That's mighty good whisky of yours, sir,\""], [261, "A Month os Madness. 253 he suggested presently ; \"and I don't mind if I have another pull at the flask ? \" \" There it stands ; help yourself. You don't want any water with it, do you ? \" \" O Lord, no ! What's the good of spoil ing good liquor ? I'm a smoker, too \u2014 where's my 'baccy pouch ? \u2014 left it in my lodgings, have I ? \" \" Try one of my cigarettes \"Thankee, sir, I will; and perhaps\" \u2014 his voice shook from intense excitement now, not from fear \u2014 \" you'd let me have a match also ? \" As I pushed the box over to him he clutched it with a suppressed growl ; then, exactly as I had expected \u2014 because he was a brave man \u2014 he forgot his own safety in his anxiety to secure me ; rushed straight to the door instead of the window, set his back against it, and whipped out a pocket derringer. \" My God ! I have you now,\" he muttered"], [262, "A Month os Madness. 254 huskily. \" Come within arm's length, and I shoot ! \" Then, in an instant, he remembered the window, and raised the box to hurl it against the glass. One loud tap would doubtless have been a sufficient signal. Drawing my weapon from the drawer, I planted myself between him and his mark. But the poor doomed creature had no chance against me. Even as his hand went up to make the cast, he squeezed the box tightly between his fingers : for a fraction of a second his face was convulsed ; then he fell, a quiver ing heap, upon the floor. He was dead before I reached him. The crimson light faded suddenly as he dropped ; and a shudder passed over me of momentary remorse and of fear for myself. For my position was now desperate\u2014 far more desperate than when the madman was hunting me down in his lonely farmhouse. Before me in the street were the three men ;"], [263, "A Month os Madness. 255 and in all likelihood others, with Yarmshaw and Philby in charge of them, were lurking close at hand. At the back also escape seemed hopeless. The door in the high wall which enclosed the gardens of the terrace was always kept locked, and, in any case, there would certainly be a sentinel stationed in the lane outside to guard it. To gain a moment or two, I strolled to the window, cigarette in mouth ; and, turning my back to it, nodded once or twice, as though still conversing with the detective. Then, snatching the box from the dead hand, and tossing the body aside, I passed swiftly into my bedroom at the back. Throwing a glance along the narrow row of gardens, I perceived a servant taking clothes from a line in the next strip but one ; otherwise they were, as far as I could see, untenanted. The dividing walls, though high enough to be difficult, were not impassable. Over them, and so down one or other of the"], [264, "A Month os Madness. 256 further gardens into the lane beyond, lay my only hope of escape. I stole down the stairs, rapidly but stealthily. Miss Wilmington was in her sitting-room chattering with the maid ; the back premises were quite deserted. In a moment I was in the garden, writh the even ing air blowing freshly upon me. I saw that the door leading into the lane was open an inch or two \u2014 but that trap was not to catch me. After one glance upwards at the backs of the houses, I leaped at the right-hand wall like a cat, drawing myself up noiselessly by strength of arm ; and so with the next and the next. The garden in which the servant girl was at work must now be crossed. As soon as my head rose above the wall, I called to her eagerly, but in a voice scarcely above a whisper \u2014 \" Have you seen that brute of a cat \u2014 the"], [265, "A Month of Madness. 257 black one ? She has been stealing our fish again.\" \" Oh, lor, sir \u2014 it ain't our cat, I do assure you. \" No ; she's your neighbour's, I believe \" \u2014 and with that I dashed past the girl, pausing on the next wall as though searching about for my quarry. But the rapid climbing was exhausting me, and there might be a scream or shout from some back window at any moment ; it was high time to make my dash for the lane into which the gardens opened. The next house but one belonged to a veterinary surgeon, whose strip of garden ended in a stable and coach-house. These were generally open, and through one or other of their doors lay the only chance of escape worth toss of coin. Collecting myself for a final effort, I crossed the remaining walls, and dropped into the right garden. '7"], [266, "258 A Month os Madness. The house windows were open, and the place seemed deserted, save by a groom whose hissing was audible down in the stable premises. Without a moment's hesitation I walked down the garden, threw open the small inner door of the coach-house, and called authoritatively to the man. \" Your master told me to go out through his back premises by way of short cut to the rectory. I take the middle path across the churchyard, I suppose ? \" \" Oh, the master be come back, then, sir ? I reckoned he was three mile away by now. Yes, the middle path's the one, and you turn short off to the right at the end on't.\" The big door of the coach-house was thrown half back, almost blocking up the narrow lane. Through a chink in it I caught sight of two men planted one on either side of Miss Wilmington's garden exit. But they were bent low, in listening"], [267, "A Month of Madness. 259 attitudes ; and, even if one of them were to raise his head for a glance in this direction, the big projecting door would cover me for several yards. Thus I had a fair chance of gaining in safety a curve in the lane which occurred almost immediately. So far, luck was befriending me. Nodding to the man, who thereupon fell to his work again, I strolled out into the lane, keeping close to the right-hand wall, and so under cover of the door. It protected me perfectly almost up to the corner. Then came a crucial moment. To gain the shelter of the bend I had to cross the open lane in full view of the two watchers, should they chance to be looking down it. Reaching this danger-point, I caught a glimpse of them over my left shoulder. They were still bending low, listening in tently ; their whole attention was concentrated upon the garden and its exit. Seeing which,"], [268, "260 A Month os Madness. I lounged quietly across the short space that intervened between me and shelter, with my right hand clutching the revolver in my pocket. In a second or two I was round the bend, in a short row of dirty cottages. There I paused a moment, but there was no sound of scurrying feet. I was undetected. There remained only to march briskly across the churchyard ; which done, I found myself upon a country road, in comparative safety. The town and rectory now lay behind me ; and, after passing a few scattered villas, I should be among fields and hedges, with the deepening twilight to further favour my escape. I had now gained a breathing-space for the consideration of my next move. The infirmary at Springwells was my objective ; that was unalterably fixed. But how to attain it ?"], [269, "A Month of Madness. 261 Without doubt I should have now to reckon with two shrewd heads, backed by a roused and maddened neighbourhood. True, some preliminary confusion might fairly be calculated on ; the discovery of my escape from the house would assuredly be followed by distracted searchings of all possible hiding-places in and about the Terrace. But such men as Philby and Yarmshaw would not long be at a loss. The former, indeed, would be only too likely, so soon as his brain got fairly to work, to hit upon my design against Spring wells ; for he had, as I have said, taken me over there several times, and knew that I had a peculiar hankering after the place. He would not be long in guessing that, were I minded to add a climacteric stroke to my month of madness, the great building full of sick people would fit itself perfectly to my intention. Moreover, they would readily assume that I should aim at some"], [270, "262 A Month os Madness. such final coup, father than at escape from the country, since, had the latter idea been in my mind at all, I should have fled long ere this. Briefly, they knew me for a reckless, desperate man, to whom but two courses were possible \u2014 a last despairing outburst, or immediate suicide. Now a branch of the main line ran to Springwells, and there were several evening trains thither. Supposing the hue-and-cry were delayed but another ten or twelve minutes I might gain the station by skirting the lower end of the town, and But even as I stood weighing the chances under the shadow of a hedgerow elm, a great clangour of discordant bells broke out from the church tower in my rear. This could have but one meaning \u2014 that the detective' s death and my flight were discovered. The news would be spreading like wildfire, the frenzied townfolk searching every hole and corner, blocking up every"], [271, "A Month os Madness. 263 avenue of retreat. Escape by rail had already become an impossibility. Nor was there any hope of doing the dis tance on foot and across country ; for, very soon \u2014 as soon perhaps as the first searchings were over and my flight from the town defi nitely ascertained, \u2014 I felt certain that Philby's mind would flash off to Springwells. The infirmary was well out of the town, and a mile distant from the nearest telegraph office ; but he would certainly wire to the latter, and would probably send men gallop ing along the main road as well. My only plan would be to get a horse and ride my hardest through the country lanes. Philby might jump at once to the right conclusion ; but, on the other hand, there might be a little delay \u2014 upon which slender thread hung my one chance. Some three hundred yards beyond me, and just short of the first turning towards Springwells, stood a good-sized inn from"], [272, "264 A Month os Madness. which I had several times hired a hack for my excursions. The risk of a call at this inn must at once be faced. I ran thither at the top of my speed, and entered, panting and crying loudly \u2014 \" There's been a bad accident in the town: a house has fallen and buried a lot of people \u2014 and our doctors' hands are so full that I'm going to gallop over to Madlow for mote medical help. Put the saddle on the chestnut mare and bring her round \u2014 look sharp, some of you ! \" \" Good Lord, sir,\" cried the landlord, tum bling hastily out of the bar, \" is that why they're makin' such a blessed row with them bells ? Now then, Bob, Jim \u2014 where be you all ? Can't you hear what Mr. Vincent is a-shoutin' ? \" There was delay \u2014 maddening delay. I could only support it by drinking hard. The landlord, knowing me for a quiet-going artist, was amazed, almost scared, to see me toss off glass after glass."], [273, "A Month os Madness. 265 \" Did you see the house fall, sir ? You be all of a tremble. And, excuse me, sir, but you'll scarce sit a horse with your skin much fuller o' brandy than it be a' ready ? \" \" Damn your talk ! \" I retorted savagely. \" Go and see after the mare.\" She came round at last. I leaped into the saddle and drove my heels into her. I rode off along the Madlow Road at a rapid trot, passing the mouth of the Spring wells Lane, because both landlord and ostler were looking after me ; then turned, walking my horse slowly back again. Now that I was fairly started, it seemed that the brandy had only steadied me ; I was firmer, more collected, than I had yet been. Well for me that it was so, for danger was already imminent. As I made stealthily back towards the turning, I caught sight of a single horseman approaching from the direction of the town. He was riding slowly ; when I quickened"], [274, "A Month of Madness. 266 my pace he did the same. The mouth of the lane was about half-way between us. We approached each other rapidly. In a few seconds the man was near enough for his shape to outline itself against the light from the west \u2014 and I at once recognized Yarmshaw. He was evidently patrolling the road upon which, in the unlikely event of my getting clear of the houses, I should be found. The sight of him set my blood boil ing ; but my brain worked clearly none the less. The light being full in my face, there was evidently no chance of stealing past him unrecognized ; and, even supposing I were to get clear away from him at the start, he would certainly make straight for Spring wells by the main road, picking up others as he passed through the town ; and so I should be cut off by a party on emergence from the network of country lanes through"], [275, "A Month of Madness. 267 which lay my course. My pursuer must be lured away from the town at all hazards. I reached the turning just before him, and seeing clearly that he recognized me, dashed down it, waving my hat to him with a wild shout of derision. This was answered at once by the rattle of his horse's hoofs : he was hot upon my track. The lane ran at first between garden walls, then past a mill, and through flat river meadows. Having a fair, though not a long start, I rode only at a hand-gallop. If he came up with me, well and good ; indeed, I fully intended that he should do so ere long, and that we should have it out together once for all. My only fear was lest he should prove wary and prudent enough to drop the chase and make for the town. I shouted again as we got between the hedges, and made as though urging my horse to the utmost. He gained on me rapidly."], [276, "268 A Month os Madness. I laughed grimly to myself to think that for once I was outman\u0153uvring the man who had held me in the hollow of his hand all my life. Some quarter of a mile before us the narrow road leaped the river upon an ancient structure of brick and stone called White Bridge. That was to be the crucial point in our death-ride ; and as I was resolved that Yarmshaw should never cross the bridge alive, it seemed likely that in a very short space of time Her Majesty's Opposition would have lost its most notable member, and the country a potential prime minister. Upon reaching the wood, it being neces sary to gain a moment or two, I gave the mare her head, and sent her along like a rocket. Just beyond the bridge, on the left side of it, thick alders lined the river bank. Behind these I pulled up sharp ; then drew my revolver, rested its barrel in the fork of a branch, and waited."], [277, "A Month os Madness. 269 I now covered with my weapon the high crown of the bridge. It was distant but a few yards. Yarmshaw would be a dead man if he rode on to it, as, in his present heat and excitement, he would assuredly do. Clat-clat-clatter ! he wras riding hard 0 enough. In a second or two man and horse came hurding forth from the gloom of the trees. But the rider's hands were down, his weight thrown back ; and, with a powerful wrench, he pulled up his beast as they rose the bridge. They came to a standstill upon the very crown of the arch, the horse almost upon his haunches, the man's form rigid and motionless. The friend-enemy, whom I had wor shipped and fought for and loved, who was now hunting me down like a beast of prey, without one ache of heart or pang of con science, was delivered into my hand. Yet that hand, which had been about his"], [278, "A Month os Madness. 270 neck a hundred times in school days, whose clasp was familiar to his hand as a brother's, refused to do my bidding. The bells which had sounded my death-knell were now silent ; the quiet river shimmered soundless in the twilight ; the stealthy mist crept along the meadow borders \u2014 no jarring pistol-shot broke upon the quietude. For me life and the world had come to a standstill. For a long-drawn second or two I re mained thus spell-bound ; then I walked my horse across the turf and back into the road. Yarmshaw's horse came forward at the same time ; he seemed to be too much astounded or scared to check him. I held the butt of my pistol towards him, and said \u2014 \" You see, I intended to shoot you from behind the alders ; but I couldn't do it. Let us fight fair, if only for the sake of old times. You're armed, no doubt ? Let us dismount on the grass here ; then choose"], [279, "A Month os Madness. 271 your distance and give the word yourself. One of us has got to die, it appears, and the sooner we settle which it is to be the better.\" He nodded curtly in acceptance of my terms, and I turned my horse's head towards the grass again. Scarcely had I done so, when he fired. His bullet grazed my ear, and blood poured down my neck. I rode at him in a frenzy, seized him by the throat, tore him off his horse, and cast him upon the ground. His horse, wild with fright, galloped away along the lane. Yarmshaw lay motionless upon the road side ; stunned or shamming dead, I could not tell which. Had he moved a limb I might have killed him. Yet I know not \u2014 0 enough that I spared this once more. The road to Springwells lay open before me ; and, with a strange mixture of sick heartedness and exultation, I gripped my saddle and gave my horse his head."], [280, "A Month os Madness. 272 CHAPTER XL 0 far Yarmshaw's pursuit had delayed me but a few moments ; and very soon I was able to make capital out of it, for I succeeded in catching his horse. The scared animal, hearing my mare's hoofs behind him, bolted through the broken fence of a small enclosure, in a corner of which I secured him without much difficulty. Thus I exchanged an ordinary second-rate hack for a powerful hunter. I now rode hard, but not wildly \u2014 fitting my horse's speed, with such nicety of judg ment as I possessed, to the distance and the ground that we had to traverse. A stony lane first ; then sandy by-ways, a"], [281, "A Month of Madness. 273 couple of village commons, the corner of a park \u2014 across which, by a couple of easy leaps, I contrived a short cut \u2014 then more lanes ; a tangled network of them, among whose intricacies, but for the risen moon, I must have gone astray more than once. Yet the pressing work that I was engaged in seemed only to stimulate the rush of my thoughts. As hedge and pale, copse and village, flashed by me, I found myself rehearsing, after the fashion of a drowning man, all the capital incidents of my life. They broke upon me with such force and in such bewildering detail, that the very mass of evidence thus presented hindered self-arraignment. There seemed to be, not a single man, but a whole group to be judged. There was the schoolboy Vella cott, champion of the oppressed, picker-up of gauntlets for the weak ; then the impul sive lover, the devoted husband (for, with all my failings, God knows I was that), the 18"], [282, "A Month os Madness. 274 too-fond father ; the passionate philanthro pist, the blood-stained fanatic. Then, follow ing closely upon this procession of vivid memories, came not less vivid waking dreams. All my victims seemed to come back to me from the place whither they had gone. Not one of them upbraided me openly, but from each one who had yielded to my persuasion, I gathered that I had done him or her an irreparable injury. Mrs. Grimes held up her empty arms, and I knew that, for a time at least, she had lost her child. The farmer's daughter uttered not a word, but her sad smile declared that even for her I had done passing ill. And so with the others ; I heard not a single harsh whisper, but their looks filled me with sadness unutterable. Lastly, I returned once more to my home, whither the tale of my misdeeds had preceded me ; and the white despair of a beloved face so wrought upon me that I groaned aloud\u2014"], [283, "A Month os Madness. 275 \" I was mad, mad ; I had lost myself hope lessly even as I have now lost you. Touch me with your lips once more before I die.\" Then a voice sounded in the air above me \u2014 \" Oh, my love \u2014 my poor love \u2014 my dear, dear love ! \" \u2014 and I seemed to feel my wife's lips upon my forehead. But the dream passed away suddenly, and I was back again in the saddle. My hand lay upon my reeking horse's neck ; his labour ing breath was loud in my ears ; the moon light fell in streaks and splashes upon the flying ground beneath us ; great oaks and ashes hemmed us in and arched us over. We were passing through a thick wood which bordered the main road to Springwells \u2014 in three minutes' time we should be in sight of the infirmary gates. Upon emerging into the broad road, I walked my horse slowly along under the trees. There was hardly a trot left in him now, much less a gallop ; any further call"], [284, "A Month os Madness. 276 upon him, howsoever great the need, would be useless. But, upon nearing the infirmary, I found all quiet. The great grey building stood back from the road some forty yards, having before it an open gravelled space protected by tall railings. The lamps at the entrance gate had not been lighted ; and, the moon being now screened by a thick cloud-bank, the dusk of its surroundings threw the lighted upper stories of the building into strong relief. The row of windows to the right of the second story claimed my chief interest, as belonging to the ward in which, if late arrangements held good, would be found all the women and children who, in their own pathetic slang, were \"going to the theatre\" to-morrow. The operating theatre itself was away at the back of the building. Hard by the infirmary was an orchard, and into this I led my jaded beast. In a corner under the hedge we came upon a small pond,"], [285, "A Month os Madness. 277 and, though every moment was precious, he had shown such pluck and endurance that I could not resist taking off the bridle to let him drink his fill. There, after washing the blood from my neck, I left him to his devices. I should need him no more : there was to be no more flight ; I was already weary of being hunted \u2014 and the end was near. A crowd of pursuers would soon be upon me, coming, if I mistook not, from two directions, for the first few words flashed along the wire to Springwells would serve to start the hue and-cry there also. Any moment almost the deep stillness of the night might be invaded by a shouting mob. Nor would there be any chance of fulfilling my old intention to sur render. The officers of justice would be too few to make head against a maddened rabble; the roughs would have it all their own way \u2014 they would batter my head in with stones, or hang me up to the cross-bar of the entrance gate."], [286, "278 A Month os Madness. My revolver might as well be thrown away now, there being no hope of self-defence ; yet, on second thoughts, I kept it \u2014 for revenge. There was just a chance that Yarmshaw, whose doggedness I knew of old, might crop up again before they finished me, in which case I swore to myself to put a bullet through him. Leaving the orchard, I marched quickly along the road, passed through the outer gates of the infirmary, and round to a side door, which I knew would be the only one unlocked. I opened the door gently, though not too stealthily, and stood for a few moments in a dimly lighted passage, listening. No one came. I locked the door hastily, dropping the key into my pocket. Hitherto I had been acting almost mechanically, but now a throb of intense excitement shook me. Before I had moved many steps I was confronted, at the foot of some stairs, by two"], [287, "A Month of Madness. 279 nurses who had just descended from the first floor. Happily I knew them both, having indeed become acquainted, through my fre quent visits, with almost every member of the infirmary staff. I explained at once that, as I happened to be in Springwells this evening, Dr. Philby had entrusted me with a message to their head surgeon ; and also that our rector wanted me to see a couple of his sick people, if I might be allowed to do so. \" Well,\" replied the elder of the two nurses, \" I'm afraid you'll find it difficult to get a word either with Mr. Paulett or Mr. Fernie, for they are very busy in the theatre, making preparations for to-morrow. You know that we are expecting Sir Francis down by the first express ? \" \" Yes, yes ; that's why the rector wished me to see those poor girls. He said they would be low and miserable with thinking of to-morrow's trouble.\""], [288, "280 A Month os Madness. \" You mean numbers five and eight in the 'Mary' ward, I expect ? Miss Nowell is up there with them now.\" \" In that case I will see her for a moment at the door, and come away. Do not trouble the surgeons, as they are so much engaged ; I'll leave a note for Mr. Paulett on my way down. And pray don't trouble to come up with me now \u2014 your ins and outs are quite familiar to me, as you know. Good night.\" \" Good night, Mr. Vincent. The pair passed on, and I mounted rapidly, with my heart hammering my ribs. Estelle Nowell in the ward ? Let her stay, then, and perish with the rest. My final triumph over her was at hand now ; nothing could avert it. Fate, instead of thwarting me at the eleventh hour, was smoothing my path. Nothing could have been more favourable to my design than the present condition of the infirmary. Doctors,"], [289, "A Month os Madness. 281 porters, nurses seemed all to have been drawn away to the theatre at the back, on no other occasion should I have found the stairs and passages that I had to traverse thus deserted. I mounted steadily upwards, unquestioned, uninterrupted ; and so gained the second floor, passed down the last long passage, and halted, sweating and trembling, at the door of the doomed ward. Then, opening the door noiselessly, I found myself in the chamber that was to be the scene of my last effort, the crown and climax of the frenzy which had made the closing month of my life a hell. The familiar aspect of the ward was wanting ; its very form and general hue struck strangely upon me. At this hour the lights should have been turned down, the nurses moving noiselessly, the whole chamber hushed.

The shadow of to-morrow lay heavily upon these fluttering souls \u2014 so heavily that my own worn and shattered heart was throbbing in unison with theirs. Howbeit, beneath the creeping dread that oppressed them there seemed to be an underlining, as it were, of far different emotion \u2014 some thing of a nobler texture, that I could not yet comprehend. It was as though an angel had whispered a single word to them, and they were waiting in hushed expectation of hearing the whisper once again, and of knowing for certain that the blessed word was \u2014 \" Hope.\" The rows of pallid faces were all turned one way, and, following the gaze of those many anxious eyes, I saw a small figure in"], [291, "A Month of Madness. 283 delicate shining white standing, with bent head, at the far end of the room. It was Estelle Nowell. Whether she had been singing to them, praying for them, or only speaking to them, I could not tell ; but she it was who, by some means or other, had cast over them a spell that I could feel. I waited, breathless as the rest, for the small head to raise itself and the trembling lips to complete the message or prayer, whatsoever it might be, for which the very silence seemed to be longing. But Estelle was for the moment speechless, held in check, perhaps, by a noble shame at the impression she had produced. Nor was I ever to learn the nature of that unfinished message, for, even as she turned with panting bosom and fluttering lashes towards them, there came from the darkness outside a growling murmur as of many voices, rising swiftly, deepening, hoarsening, and swelling into a"], [292, "284 A Month os Madness. mighty roar. None could doubt the mean ing of that sound \u2014 a sound such as, in the days of the bloody Inquisition, must have fallen upon the ears of many a quailing heretic on his way to the stake \u2014 the cry of a maddened multitude for its ordained victim. A horrified whisper, broken here and there by a whimper of terror, hissed round the ward. All eyes were still turned to Miss Nowell, including those of two nurses who were sitting apart at a table. She shuddered with amazement, but, regaining her self-control by an effort, raised a hand as though to calm them. I took a step backward to the door, turned the key in the lock, and broke it there. The clash of the iron brought every head round ; the terrified eyes seemed to leap at me all together, in one confused glare. \" Who are you ? . . . what \u2014 what are you doing ? \" cried Miss Nowell, advancing swiftly down the room."], [293, "A Month os Madness. 285 For answer I strode across to the window opposite me and tore aside the curtain. The window was wide open. I thrust forth my head, and a score of lanterns and torches flared up at me. A yell of execration broke from the crowd as they recognized their prey. The jostling roaring mob filled the wrhole space in front of the building. The long vista of road, too, was black with hurrying figures ; the whole town of Springwells was pouring forth its living contents in a frenzied stream. For the moment I was appalled \u2014 I shrank back from the window as though the torch flames had singed my face. \" Burst the doors open, damm ye ! \" \" Throw un down for us to tear and trample.\" \" Come down, you spawn o' hell, and we'll send 'ee to your proper place. \" ' ' You've done your last murder, d'ye hear, Vincent ?

The intoxication of the crowd was passing into my own brain. I leaned out of the window again to give back jeer for jeer ; and even as a fresh yell arose, and a great stone crashed through the glass above my head, I saw Yarmshaw, with others at his heels, come spurring up to the outskirts of the throng. They opened out at first, with shouts of \" Make way for Yarmshaw ; he'll have un out of it fast enough ! \" The sight of the man whom I had twice spared to-night goaded me to madness. I raved at him for a moment, forgetting my pistol ; then I dragged it from my pocket, rested my jerking wrist and arm upon the window-sill, and, waiting till his horse was"], [295, "A Month os Madness. 287 fairly embedded in the crowd, and his cold eyes were upturned to mine, I fired twice into his breast. He sank down among the swaying heads, disappearing like a shot beast in storm-swept waters. For the space of one heart-beat there was a dead silence, and then, my God, what a roar of fury broke against the great stone building ! Then, before the windows had ceased to rattle in response to that thunder-roll of sound, I became aware of a loud knocking behind me. They were trying to force the door of the ward. Dropping my pistol and darting across the room, I heard the scuffle of many feet ; they were lifting something forward of weight enough to beat in the panels. There was not a second to lose. My eyes fell upon a tenantless bed close at hand ; I dragged at it with superhuman strength, hauled it along sideways, and jammed it hard and fast against the lower half of the door. As 0"], [296, "A Month os Madness. 288 I looked breathlessly round for something to pile upon it, the scuffling increased, and a great baulk of wood came rending and crashing through the upper panels. Turning to pick up my pistol for a shot through the opening, my glance fell upon a scene of terror that even at this moment checked and awed me. Some of the unhappy creatures whom I had come to destroy lay motionless in their beds, paralyzed with fright ; some were huddled together in a dishevelled heap at the far end of the room ; one \u2014 a girl of scarce fifteen years \u2014 lay upon the floor at my feet, stone-dead from shock. I stared, fascinated, into the dead eyes, and ere I could recover myself a pistol was discharged close to my ear. For a moment I clutched at the air, sway ing and staggering, but the bullet had not touched me. My sight cleared \u2014 I saw Estelle Nowell, with her back against the window-sill,"], [297, "A Month os Madness. 289 fumbling with the hammer of my revolver. Failing to draw it back for another shot, she seized the weapon by the barrel, and, raising it over her head, advanced upon me. The girl's eyes blazed ; her face was trans figured with fury \u2014 there was not a line of fear in it. \" You demon ! \" she cried hoarsely. \" I know you now. Have you come here for a last batch of victims, you murderous devil ? You shan't touch one of them while I'm alive ! \" The small hand descended. I laughed in her face as I caught the little wrist, wrenched away the pistol, and hurled it through the open window. \" Yes, I've come on my usual errand ; but there's no chance of a painless death for this lot of victims \u2014 we must all burn together. You can't save them. There's no time even to preach ; you had better say your last prayer.\" 19"], [298, "A Month os Madness. 290 With that I tossed her aside on to the floor, and, seizing the lamp, broke off the glass chimney and applied the flame to the hanging table-cloth. The table was covered with picture-papers and scraps of needlework ; the flame had them fast in an instant. With fierce haste I threw on more papers, screens \u2014 every thing inflammable that I could lay hands on. Already the ward was full of suffocating smoke. I darted to the window with a torch of flaming newspaper, and fired the curtains. Estelle, half-rising as I drew back, clutched at me so fiercely that I fell to the floor with her. At the same time a final shout of triumph rose from below as the heavy front door at length yielded to their battering. One heard the roaring trampling mob surging into the hall and bursting up the stairways. Cursing and raving, I tore at the girl's wrists, but not until her strength gave way suddenly could I free myself."], [299, "A Month of Madness. 291 Then I struggled to my feet, with her form lying limp and flaccid across my arm, raised her high above my head with both hands, and strode once more to the window. The doorway below was blocked by a struggling mass of people now ; the whole gravelled space was covered by a forward striving crowd of those who had failed to gain entrance. I shouted to them scoffingly, holding the girl aloft with stiffened arms. A sea of faces was turned up to me, gleaming redly in the torchlight. Behind and around me the flames leaped and crackled while choking smoke swirled and eddied in the draught from the window. Silence fell upon the crowd as I stood thus : not a voice rose up to answer me \u2014 they shrunk and cowered, seeing that I was about to cast my burden upon their heads. I paused for a moment to gloat over them, then swung the slight figure back, and with all my force hurled it"], [300, "A Month os Madness. 292 forward into the reddened air.

Not to fatigue you further, however, with talk of a convalescence, during which I must have been a burden to every one about me, I may say at once that my old friend's prognosis proved to be a sound one.

Yet at last a day came when this decrepit hope of mine began to shake off its feeble ness, to tremble and stir with new life. I had left my doctor and my sick-room, the house that no longer had any savour of home, the stale flat atmosphere of the sun-scorched city, and was speeding westward with my beloved nurse. We spoke but little, for I think she saw that a change was coming, and so was too happy to be other than silent. As we journeyed I looked dreamily out upon elm-shaded meadows, reaches of sun-steeped river, breadths of mellow corn land ; and the bland repose of nature seemed to pass into my heart \u2014 to affect me, in truth, miraculously, though doubtless I had really progressed so far that there needed but a touch to transform me. \"How long a stay shall we make at Exeter ? \" I asked, rousing myself after a"], [315, "A Month os Madness. 307 prolonged silence ; \" we should settle that point, I think ? \" \" You suggested a day or two, dear ? \"A week at least \u2014 I shall fear to go on sooner.

But when at length we left the road, and turned into the familiar drive with its fringes of tall osmunda, my courage revived on a sudden. The atmosphere of the old place was like strong wine in my blood ; I laughed away my fears, and leaned forward to get the first glimpse of our honeymoon house. My wife was the least capable of the two now ; I began for the first time since the illness to take command of her.

But I was too restless to taste the old-time flavour of our proceedings ; and Lilian, feeling that I was screwing up my courage for a certain plunge afterwards, soon became as anxious as myself. \" I am going for a walk through the larch wood,\" I remarked carelessly, when she could find no further excuse for linger ing over the teacups ; \" and \u2014 perhaps as far as the orchard gate.

The elder Le Marchant, the unheroic hero, the bewitch ing and heartless Lady Constance, and, above all, Mrs. Farquhar, have, as far as we know, no counterparts in fiction.

It is a shrewd and wise saying which Mr. Norris puts in the mouth of Maxwell, that ' let a man's memory be never so good, the utmost it can do for him is to retain facts ; it cannot hold emotion.' Not less true, in spite of its cynicism, is the remark that nowadays 4 a man may run away with his neighbour's wife, and resume his place in society when he chooses, if he will only show his penitence by deserting her.

Perhaps those readers whose fount of tears lies some what close to their eyes ought to be warned against it as likely to make too large a demand upon their sympathies ; but the ordinary reader who does not mind being a little affected with that melancholy of which the charm has been sung by an English poet, will find it well worthy of perusal. W7e are not ashamed to confess that we have ourselves followed the simple and unaffected narrative with an interest and a pleasure which other more exciting and sensational works have failed to arouse in us.

Dollie Maynard, too, is a fascinating young personage, and the way in which she gradually awakens to the merits of her somewhat grave and old fashioned lover is charmingly depicted. But the most striking and original portrait in the book is that of Janet St. John, the sister-in-law of the heroine, and wife of Maurice St. John, the hard-working East-end clergyman.

In her latest novel she has been truer to this principle than in any other of her works, and it is this quality which makes us say 4 Mrs. liligh ' will give more pleasure than any other of the series. The book is a truer picture of woman's love, of her sacrifice of it to a girl, and of the woman's only possible reward, than any Miss Broughton has yet given us. Time, practice, and a sense of literary art have produced in her a form of skill in writing which is apparent upon every page of her new story. How the story is worked out Miss Broughton's readers will see for themselves, and we repeat that she has given them a novel more worthy of remembrance than any she has yet written.\" \u2014 The Pall Mall Gazette. i\u00ab CLEVEDEN. By Maey Linskill (\" Stephen Yorke\"). \"The heroine's story is told, and her character drawn with much delicacy of touch, and our sympathy is powerfully enlisted for the timid and affectionate nature that leans upon love, and the religiousness, vague but strong, that bears her through all the dreariness of her desertion by her first lover, and the trust and dependence that drew her gradually towards the less fascinating, but far deeper and stronger nature of the man who becomes her husband. Stephen Yorke's sketches of dale scenery are beautiful, and clearly the work of one who not only knows them intimately and loves them dearly, but whose tasteful and poetic feeling can appreciate the minuter delicacies of varying seasons and weather, and can^gather from Nature in all her aspects her deeper and higher meanings.\"\u2014 The Spectator."], [348, "28 BENTLEYS' FAVOURITE NOVELS. i\u00ab FOR LILIAS. By Eosa Nouchette Caeey. \" The materials from which the story has been constructed have been managed, not only with exceedingly delicate and tender handling, but with such unusual ingenuity and fertility of resource, that the result is a novel which not only abounds in graceful and touching passages, but may be fairlv said to possess the merit of originality. All the characters are excellently drawn, with strong strokes and in decided outlines, yet always with the utmost delicacy and refinement of touch.\" \u2014 The Guardian. \" The story is decidedly interesting, especially as it is impossible to foresee at any given point what wUl follow \u2014 an increasingly rare phenomenon. The novel is well written and the various characters well described.\" \u2014 The Graphic. \"Just the kind of tale which a kindly, shrewd, and sensible woman might write, and in its thorough womanliness we have found its principal charm. It is a simple, earnest, and withal very interesting story ; well conceived, carefully weirked out and sympathetically told.\" \u2014 Vanity Fair. \"* AUNT ANNE. By Mrs. W. K. Clifford. \" Mrs. Clifford has achieved a success of a very unusual and remarkable kind in this book. She has had the extreme daring to take for the subject of her story the romance of an old woman, and to till her canvas with this one figure. . . . She and her treatment are quite original and new. She is often laughable, but always touching ; her little figure is full of an old fashioned grace, though grace combined with oddity ; her sense of her 4 position,' her susceptibilities in that respect, her boundless generosity, are always delightful. Indeed, we do not know when we have met with a more loving and recognisable, as well as attractive personage in fiction.\" \u2014 The Spectator. \" One of the most memorable creations of modern fiction. The character of Aunt Anne is not a mere tour de force. It is one of those \u2014 one is almost tempted to say immortal \u2014 creations whose truth mingles so insistently with its charm in every touch that it is hard to say whether it is its truth which makes the charm or the charm which persuades you into believing in its truth.\" \u2014 The Sunday Sun. \" Mrs. Clifford has given us a book which will compel attention \u2014 a really strong book, with a vivid technique, a delicacy and faithfulness in the presentment of character, which are much to seek in contemporary fiction. . . . Mrs. Clifford is one of the half-dozen women in whose hands, far more than in those of the men, the future of the English novel rests.\" \u2014 The Pall Mall Gazette. \"The tale, as a whole, is as skilful as it is fresh in scheme and tone.

We knew the writer of ' Mrs. Keith's Crime,' but we were not prepared for the originality, completeness, delicacy, sub acid humour, and pathetic power of this remarkable novel. The dignified, eccentric, huffish, sentimental, extravagant, generous, unreasonable, pre posterous, but never for a moment ridiculous old lady is by far the most charming person to whom any novelist has introduced us for a very long time.\"\u2014 The World. i\" THE SOUL OF LILITH By Maeie Coeelli. 44 A weird but fascinating novel, intensely exciting, and deals with a strangeness of character that will give even the jaded and habitual novel reader a thrill and an emotion, and yet the story is one of to-day. ...

Passages of dignity and melody are of frequent occur rence. Happy metaphor and brilliant illustration spring readily to hand.

By Maey Linskill. \"If Miss Linskill had written only her fine 'Tales of the North Riding,' they would have been sufficient to fix her title of Novelist of the North. Her characters are portraits of northern folk, as they who have lived among them will recognise, and her scenery is precisely what one's memory recalls.\" \u2014 The Sheffield Daily Telegraph. \"What Mr. Hardy is to 'the Wessex country, Mary Linskill might have become to the North Riding of Yorkshire, had her life been spared a little longer. The ' Tales of the North Riding ' give many evidences of her real ability, and, in the second story, 4Theo's Escape,' Miss Linskill rises to the level of her best novel, and in it she displays the strongly artistic faculty which is never absent from any of her books.\"\u2014 The Manchester Examiner. 146 GOD'S FOOL. By Maarten Maartens. \"The story of Elias, God's Fool, is in some respects beautiful, in all curious, and thickset with gems of thought. The picture of the creature with the clouded brain, the missing senses, the pure and holy soul, and the unerring sense of right, living in his deafness and darkness by the light and the law of love, is a very fine conception, and its contrast with tbe meanness and wickedness of his surroundings is worked out with high ait.\"\u2014 The World."], [350, "BENTLEYS' FAVOURITE NOVELS. 30 \"A very able, and, what is perhaps more rare, a moving psychological study. From first to last nothing but compassion is excited by the ill starred Elias Lossell, shut out, as the result of an accident, from com munication with the world around him ; and yet, within the narrow bounds of a half -deadened mind, capable of generous as well as emotional feeling.\" \u2014 The Morning Post. \"A very interesting and charming story. Elias Lossell only became a fool gradually, as the result of an accident which happened to him in early youth. Gradually the light of this world's wisdom died out for him ; gradually the light of God's wisdom dawns and develops in him. The way these two lights are opposed and yet harmonized is one of the most striking features of the book. As a subtle study of unusual and yet perfectly legitimate combination of effect, it is quite first-rate.\" \u2014 The Guardian. LOVER OR FRIEND ? 117 By Eosa Nouchette Carey.
