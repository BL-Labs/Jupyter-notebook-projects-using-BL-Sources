CHAPTER I. LINKS A WANTING. TSABEL ELLIOTT started involuntarily as they entered the lighted drawing-room. Her father was very pale, and his face had a drawn, haggard look. He looked years older than he had done an hour earlier. ' Father ! ' she exclaimed, ' you must not take it for granted that there is anything seriously amiss. There may be some explanation, or some merely trifling accident may have happened.' Her words fell cold on her own heart, heavy with a dread which seemed almost to be a cer- tainty that something must be very seriously amiss. For all his answer, Mr. Elliott began to move restlessly about the room.

' I do not mean that. In general appearance, size, and build. Is it likely that in imperfect light he might be mistaken for me % ' ' Hardly, I think. He may be about your height, but he is quite a differently built man. What makes you ask such a question ? ' ' I have a horrible dread upon me \u2014 horrible ! ' He gave a long shudder. ' Well, do not let us discuss the point until we hear what has really happened. Do come and sit down, father. You will do your foot a serious mischief, if you do not let it rest.' ' Confound my foot ! ' he replied, as he threw himself down upon the sofa, and pressed his hand upon his eyes. Even then absolute stillness seemed unendurable to him, and he kept moving restlessly on his seat, while his daughter sat straining her ears for any sound, and hearing nothing but the heavy throbbing of her own heart. Thus the n.inutes dragged on their weary length, until nearly"], [11, "DUNCAN MORAY. 3 an hour had passed. Then Marion Boswell ap peared at the door, with tears running down her cheeks. ' Peter's come back, sir,' she said. ' It's nae been a lang hunt. They found him lying under the rock, just where the road takes the turn, under the big pine tree.' ' Do you mean that he is dead ? ' gasped Isabel. The question seemed to choke her. ' They think not. But he's awfu' sair hurt. There was a hantle o' people had come, an' Dr. Fleming was there, sae they just got a stretcher an' carried him hame at once. Peter says he maun just hae fa'en ower, through no kenning the road weel, an' it being a bit dark there.' ' Nonsense, woman,' exclaimed Mr. Elliott sharply. ' Peter is a fool. Tell him to come here directly.' Marion retired. ' What do you mean, father ? ' Isabel asked. ' What else can have happened ? ' ' Time enough to discuss that when we hear more. But Mr. Moray was not a man born in a town, and only used to walk along level streets at night, by gas light. Go down at once,' he said to"], [12, "4 DUNCAN MORAY.

Do not allow any one to go near the edge of the craig, and keep off it yourself. As soon as you are sure every one is away, go down to Rossan, and tell the policeman to come the moment it is light, and examine the place before any one tramples about it. Tell Mrs. Blair to lock the lodge gates, and allow no one to pass until after the policeman has been in the morning.' ' Oh, father,' Isabel exclaimed, in a slightly tremulous voice, as the door closed behind Peter, ' what is it you fear ? Surely it can only have been an accident ? ' ' As far as Mr. Moray was concerned, perhaps. But you must see yourself it is most improbable that a man used to the country should have fallen over a place like that on a not very dark night. Even had he never been on the road, he knew its general character. The suggestion is absurd. If it was an accident, there must have been some cause.

I fear it will hardly be to sleep much, but at least you will rest, and you look sorely in need of it. This has given you a terrible shock. You look very white.' There was an almost wistful tenderness in his tone. His daughter tried to smile faintly. ' I think, if faces are an index, you need rest more than I do,' she said. ' No, my dear,' he replied. ' I have been used to a wild life. Sudden death, even murder, do not come to me with any shock of novelty. Had I not a special reason for feeling very deeply about this occurrence, I fear I should take it in a way which would seem to you very heartless. Go and try to rest. I will send up to Craignellan the first thing in the morning.' ' Oh, no, do not do that. I will go up myself before breakfast. I would not, for the world, his son should think me indifferent. You cannot think how kind and good the dear old man was to me ' \u2014 a sob choked her utterance. 'Poor child, poor child,' muttered Mr. Elliott"], [14, "6 DUNCAN MORAY. hoarsely. ' There, do not linger, my love,' he added, almost impatiently. ' If you can rest a little, it will help to steady your nerves.' Isabel obeyed, and went her way to the rest of silence and solitude, if not of sleep. That Adam Moray's death, if not already a fact, was a certainty, she never for a moment doubted, and her grief was deeper than she would even herself have expected. And the shock was almost greater than the grief. She had been too young when her mother died to have more than a vague recollection of her, so that it was the first time that death had come closely within the range of her personal experience : come with au element of dread and mystery wholly un connected with an ordinary death bed, or even with a clearly explained accident. The mellow beauty lighting up the evening of a life of purity, honourable integrity, and genial kindliness, had richly adorned Adam Moray's old age, and had deeply impressed itself on a character inately noble in thought and sentiment, aud doomed to dwell among the depressinginfluences of constant associa tion with the petty aims and low moral standard"], [15, "DUNCAN MORAY. 7 of ordinary life, and she had learned, in that short time, dearly to love the stately old man who had shown such fatherly kindness towards her. And he was gone \u2014 struck down within a few hours of the time she had seen him in the full vigour of a hale old age ; and \u2014 cruellest, thought of all \u2014 he had lain for hours bleeding, dying, among those pitiless stones, while she, in ease, health, and com fort, sat reading by the fire, not a quarter of a mile away. Then, as if this in itself was not a heavy enough sorrow, the hasty utterances of his son, the words and actions of her own father, had mingled with the grief an element of horror and dread. That a suspicion of foul play was in the minds of both was evident. Yet how was it possible that both, total strangers to each other and each other's affairs, could dread one and the same danger? Were the powers of evil so actively at work in the peaceful Rossan valley, that danger of foul play from more than one quarter had threatened a singularly blameless benevolent life? An element of mystery as well as of horror seemed to pervade this, her first experience of the dark side of life."], [16, "DUNCAN MORAY. 8 She did not shed many tears. She was a genuine Elliott, and the Elliotts, like most of the old families who have made history in Scotland, were not a crying race. But her face was pale and worn, and in her eyes was the weary, heavy look born of sorrow and sleeplessness, when she descended the stairs early the following morning. On the gravel before the house her father was standing, in deep discussion with the local police man. The man was holding in his hand a hat, which, on her appearance, he hastily thrust behind him. Isabel intuitively divined the reason of his action, and her pale face grew even paler as she asked her father \u2014 'Have you succeeded in making' out anything?' He shook his head. ' Very little,' he said. ' There are certainly some rather suspicious ap pearances, but the ground is so dry and hard just now that little impression is made upon it by any thing. There are no distinct marks of footsteps, which were what I hoped we might find.' 'Do you think it impossible that Mr. Moray may have fallen over the craig by accident?'"], [17, "DUNCAN MORAY. 9 Isabel asked, turning to the policeman. The only alternative was, to her, so horrible, tbat she longed to hear anyone support the opinion that the fall might be purely accidental. ' I couldna think it likely ony man wad fa' ower there on sic a nicht as last nicht, unless he'd been drinking, an' that's what naebody ever kent Mr. Moray to do. But the doctor has settled that point. There's a blow on the heid that he says was na caused by the fall.' Isabel shuddered, as all the worst fears gather ing round the fatal fact thus received strong con firmation. ' Who could have done it ? ' she said, in a low tone. ' Ah, that's the difficulty. It was naebody be longing to these parts, that's easy kent. There's nae twa men in Scotland mair likit an' respectit than Mr. Moray an' his son. But I've been ques tioning a' about the place, an' I canna hear o' ony strangers having been seen about. There's but few tramps on the road just noo.' Mr. Elliott smiled faintly a slightly contemp tuous smile over local acuteness. ' The man who"], [18, "DUNCAN MORAY. 10 came into the neighbourhood with any such pur pose in his mind,' he said, ' would be pretty sure to take good care not to be seen.' The policeman shot a quick sharp glance at him. ' Ye dinna ben these thinly inhabited dis tricts sae weel as I do, sir, or ye'd ken it was no sae easy for a man to come into them an' escape a' notice. Besides, we dinna ken that he came wi' ony sic purpose.' ' He must have been at a most convenient spot for its accomplishment, just at the right moment. It looks uncommonly like it.' ' Weel, we'll see what the Fiscal maks o't when he comes. I doubt he'll be wanting to see baith yersel an' Miss Elliott, sir. I suppose ye'll no be far frae home the day ? ' ' You may make sure of that. But if the Fiscal wants to see me, you must send some sort of trap for me. I have neither carriage nor horses here yet, and I could not possibly walk so far as Rossan.' Heartily thankful that she had not to pass through the village, Isabel set out for Craignellan,"], [19, "DUNCAN MORAY. 11 all the pleasant memories of the past seeming only to intensify the darkness of the present, as she crossed the valley, and climbed the hill. Never again would the kindly old man welcome her with tho genuine warmth which told her how much he prized her visits. Never again would the atmosphere of peace and love which seemed to pervade the house invigorate her with its in spiriting and yet soothing power. It would have been better, she said bitterly to herself, to have lived on her lonely, loveless life, with no experi ence of any other, than to have had this passing glimpse of one so purely and abidingly bright, only to be thrust back into the chilling gloom which had hitherto been her lot. She passed quietly round to the back door, when she reached the house, and tapped gently. The grief-stricken face of Joan Clark almost in stantly appeared. 'Eh, Miss Elliott, is that yersel? Sic a like time for ye to be astir ! Just come awa in.' ' Is he living? ' Isabel asked. 'Ah, mem, he's living yet, but frae what Dr."], [20, "12 DUNCAN MORAY.

' He's nae been conscious ava, that I ben, an' I doubt ' \u2014 she paused as if listening, and Duncan Moray's voice was heard, gently calling her name. ' Is that Miss Elliott ? ' Isabel heard him ask. Then in reply to Joan's affirmative, he said \u2014 ' Ask her to come upstairs.' Without a moment's hesitation Isabel obeyed the summons. Duncan Moray was standing at the head of the stairs, and a pang of keen self-reproach shot through the girl's heart at the remembrance of the selfish grief which had ruled her musings during her morning walk, as she looked up at the sternly composed face above her, aged and lined, with something almost fierce in its rigid stillness."], [21, "DUNCAN MORAY. 13 What was her grief, beside that which lay beneath the outwardly calm exterior of the strong man's unflinching endurance ? A strange spasm crossed his face for a moment, as his eyes met Isabel's. But he only said, in a low voice \u2014 ' I knew ye would come. I was watching for ye. I want ye to come an' see him. Ye need have nae fear. There is nothing to distress ye. His face is no injured.' Without a word Isabel followed him to the side of the bed on Avhich the unconscious sufferer lay, and stood motionless beside it. There was no sign of pain or uneasiness upon the still calm face. But for the quick irregular breathing, he might have been quietly sleeping. Suddenly she looked up, to meet again the strange expression in Duncan Moray's eyes. ' Is there no hope ? ' Her lips formed the words, but they were hardly even an audible whisper. Duncan shook his head without speaking. Then he bent forward, and taking hold of one of Isabel's hands, and of one of his father's, which was lying"], [22, "14 DUNCAN MORAY. on the quilt, he placed them in each other, and gently pressed them together. ' Kiss him, Miss Elliott,' he said, in a low whis per ; ' ye've little idea how he loved ye. The doctor thinks he may be conscious yet, for a wee while. I'd fain tell him ye came an' kissed him, ere he gaed awa for ever.' Isabel mutely obeyed. With one hand clasping the nerveless one which had so often fondly re turned its pressure, she printed a lingering kiss on the pale cheek. ' Thank you,' Duncan Moray said. ' If I've a chance to tell him that, it'll be mair to him than ye can rightly understand.' Silently they walked together to the head of the stairs, and there Isabel held out her hand. He took it in his, looked at her for a moment still with that strange expression, the meaning of which she could not fathom, and then pressed it to his lips. But he did not speak, and without any further salutation Isabel glided noiselessly down the stairs. Her father met her at the door of the house on"], [23, "DUNCAN MORAY. 15 her return, and she answered at once the eager almost strained expression of his face. 'He has not been conscious, the housekeeper thinks. The doctor says he may possibly become so for a short time ; but there is no hope.' Mr. Elliott drew a long deep breath, and leaned back against the door post. ' No hope,' he re peated. ' None.' ' Poor old man ! Poor old man ! Isabel passed into the house without speaking again. Not a word did she say of her interview with Duncan Moray, and his strange conduct. The tenderness and consideration her father had shown towards herself had both touched and soothed her, yet it had by no means so removed her abiding consciousness of a total want of sym pathy between them, as to inspire her with any wish to take him into her confidence. Those sen sitive spiritual nerves which convey to the soul sonsations almost too delicate to give birth therein to distinct perceptions, were already warning her that though, for some reason not understood by"], [24, "16 DUNCAN MORAY. her, her father was mucb shaken and agitated by what had happened, the death of Adam Moray was not in itself an event he regarded with much regret. Towards midday a message came to say that as circumstances had turned out, it would be un necessary for the Procurator Fiscal to trouble Mr. Elliott to come to Rossan. He would, however, like to see both him and Miss Elliott, and would call hunself during the afternoon. He came about three o'clock. ' I am glad,' he said, ' to be able to spare you the inconvenience of attending a formal investigation. Most fortun ately, Mr. Moray had a brief lucid interval, just after my arrival, and I was able to take his deposi tion. The clearness of his mind was shown by his instantly recognising me, and understanding why I was there. It is, I am sorry to say, a case of murder. He named his murderer, a total stranger in these parts, James Carfrae.' Isabel uttered a faint exclamation. Mr. Elliott started up in agitation. ' Good God ! Then my worst fears are justified."], [25, "DUNCAN MORAY. 17 The poor old man has been murdered in mistake for me.' ' Ha ! what makes you think so ? ' ' The Carfraes were old retainers of our family. This man was, as a young fellow in my service. He got into trouble, and was dismissed. I have had begging letters from him, from time to time, all through my life, and threatening ones since I refused to help him any further. Some little time since I received one, saying he had heard I had succeeded to my cousin's property, and threaten ing dire vengeance if I did not help him. I wrote rather a sharp answer, deeming it best to show no fear of him. And this is the result.' ' No, Mr. Elliott, I think you are distressing yourself needlessly. What I have heard leaves me no doubt that, whatever may have been the man's intentions as regards yourself, his attack on Mr. Moray was deliberate. In fact, you have yourself supplied the strongest possible reason for his making it. Mr. Moray's brief statement was supplemented by important information from his sou. It appears that the elder Moray knew this 2 B"], [26, "18 DUNCAN MORAY. man many years since, in Australia, and was wit ness to his committing a murder. Lately he met him again, in a town not far from here, where he was making close inquiries about this neighbour hood. Mr. Moray was convinced the man neither recognised him, nor suspected that he was himself recognised. In both opinions he Avas evidently mistaken. The fellow has probably been secreted in the neighbourhood, watching for a chance to remove the only man who might have rendered begging visits to you dangerous. Mr. Moray's account is quite clear. The man sprang upon him from behind the pine tree, just as he passed. He recognised him, and involuntarily uttered his name. They grappled, but Mr. Moray's foot slipped, and before he could re cover himself, a tremendous blow on the head stunned him. Then no doubt the scoundrel threw him over the craig, hoping he would be killed in stantaneously, and his death be attributed to acci dent. You are, I am sure, distressing yourself needlessly, in believing yourself the unintentional cause of the murder.'"], [27, "DUNCAN MORAY. 19 Mr. Elliott twisted his features into a faint semb lance of a smile. ' Your hypothesis would be more consolatory,' he replied, with cold sarcasm of tone, ' if it explained how it came about that a man who had not the faintest reason to suppose that Mr. Moray and 1 were even acquainted, should have been waiting for him within my private grounds at eight o'clock at night ! ' ' That hypothesis,' replied the Fiscal, evidently a little nettled by the tone, 'is surely not more im probable than that a man who had much to hope from your life, and nothing to gain from your death, should have come here merely to murder you? ' The improbability would be less manifest to you, if you were better acquainted with the cir cumstances. Carfrae knows me quite well enough to know what it means when I write in a certain strain, aud he is one of the most vindictive fellows I ever knew. The important question, however, is what are you going to do ? ' 'Try to find the man, of course,' but the diffi culty is that we have not the faintest idea of his"], [28, "20 DUNCAN MORAY. appearance. Though, by the bye, that is perhaps not the case now. Can you describe him, Mr. Elliott ? ' He shook his head. ' I have not seen him for more than twenty years, and as he is a man near my own age he will be greatly altered probably.' ' Probably not, I think, as Mr. Moray recognised him, after a much longer interval.' ' Well, as I remember him, he was a man near about my own height, but a heavier built man, and I think rather fairer in general colouring than I am.' ' And about your age ? ' 'Yes. My impression is that he is a few years older than I am. But put him doAvn at from sixty to sixty-fi\\re, and for all practical purposes you Avill not be far wrong.' The Fiscal made a note in his pocket-book, then he turned to Isabel : ' I understand you met Mr. Moray yesterday afternoon,' he said. ' Did he say anything that might imply he had any suspicion of this man being in the neighbourhood ? '"], [29, "DUNCAN MORAY. 21 'Not a word. But I certainly thought him looking grave and anxious.' ' Did he allude to his intended visit to Mr. Elliott?' ' Yes. We spoke of it.' ' Was it possible that this man might have been within hearing ? ' ' Quite impossible. We met a little beyond the forge. Just Avhere no one could have been within hearing, without being seen.' ' You are on the right tack, however,' remarked Mr. Elliott, quietly. ' If you can find out that Mr. Moray mentioned his intention of coming here to anyone, you may chance to light upon a clue. Otherwise you have not the ghost of a chance. Carfrae is one of the shrewdest, cleverest fellows I ever knew.' ' We shall, of course, leave no stone unturned,' replied the Fiscal, coldly, as he rose to leave. ' I am not Avithout hope we may get help from out side. The news of the murder is spreading far and wide. In a thinly populated country like this, there is every hope some one may have"], [30, "22 DUNCAN MORAY. obseiwed the man. If so, Ave shall soon hear of it.' With that he took his leave, and Mr. Elliott threw himself back on a sofa, Avith an air of rest less Aveariness. Isabel rose to leave the room, feeling as if she could better face in solitude the crowd of conflicting, painful sensation aroused by the Fiscal's recital. She fervently hoped that his opinion was the correct one; still, there Avas at least a possibility that the life of the father, fur whom she had never felt any sentiment very much warmer than friendly neutrality, had been pre served at the cost of the life of the old man who had so quickly won a prominent place in her affections, and the mere consciousness of such a possibility was bitter enough, without the instinc thTe perception which folloAved that it was one on which it would do to reflect. As she was passing close to her father, however, he caught her hand and detained her. ' Has my life been purchased at too dear a cost, Isabel ? ' he asked, in a tone which was half bitter, half mournful. She coloured involuntarily. The question"], [31, "DUNCAN MORAY. 23 seemed to give substance and shape at once to the vague, troubled perceptions which were oppressing her. But what strange metamorphosis Avas this which had made her father, of all people, thus keenly perceptive of her moods ? With a sudden rush of impulse, she replied, almost A'ehemently. ' I am too much bewildered to knoAv what I do feel ; but were it so, father, Avould the fault be mine ? You have always been kind to me, but ask yourself if, in all my life, until the last few days, I have ever received proof of anything Avhich could be called love from you ? How different it was with Mr. Moray you cannot, of course, tell. But you ought never to have asked a question I should studiously have avoided allowing to take shape in my own thoughts.' ' I know it all,' he replied. ' You have no need to parade my sins and shortcomings before me, Isabel. I am painfully aware that a harvest has suddenly sprung up from seed Avhich I deemed had lost all vitality, and I confess I am a little inclined to say, \" My punishment is greater that I can bear.\" Perhaps you Avill hardly believe me"], [32, "24 DUNCAN MORAY. when I say that to find that such deep sorrow is brought upon you by the death of one who, but for some of my earlier errors, might yet be alive aud well, is a heavy addition to my burden.' ' He spoke with such intense sadness of tone that the girl's heart was touched, and she stooped and kissed his forehead. ' Are you quite sure you are right there ? I cannot but think the Fiscal was right. It was more probable the mau was designedly seeking Mr. Moray, than intending to murder you.' ' Neither you nor the Fiscal know quite all that I know, though of course this story of earlier con nection between Mr. Moray and Carfrae was neAv to me. But even granting that Mr. Moray was the intended victim, Carfrae would never have come into this neighbourhood but for me. Still, there is more than you know or ever will know, I hope ; and though, from the time I married your mother, my life has been, I believe, as blameless as most men's, I have known for some time that I stood in danger of total shipwreck.

But to the last day of my life I shall feel that I am Mr. Moray's murderer.' ' Oh, no. Not that' ' I feel it so now. Whether the impression will wear off, or deepen, I cannot tell. One thing is certain. I am growing an old man. Five and twenty years since, the whole business would not have cost me a night's sleep. Noav I feel as if I had had a shaking I shall never get over. Isabel, what is it?' She had turned very Avhite, and her hand had tightened upon his with a sudden nervous tre mour, as a sharp pang of terror darted across her.

A strange expression crossed Mr. Elliott's face, but he answered boldly at once \u2014 ' You need have do fear about that, my dear child. I don't suppose the fellow has been known as Carfrae, save to myself, for the last thirty years. If a dead man could rise suddenly out of his grave, commit a murder, and go back to it again, they would be as likely to arrest him.

For Isabel Elliott no such soothing opiate was available. She Avas forced to wear her crown of thorns, and face the indis putable truth, that just when her father most needed such filial tenderness as she found it possible to bestoAv on him, the fact asserted itself with peculiar vividness that his influence on her life was by no means au altogether inspiriting one.

' Should the day eArer come when ye dinna ken whar to seek a friend, never fear but ye'll find a father's loA'e waiting for ye at Craignellan.' How often she had lovingly lingered, in memory, upon those words, the first which had ever brought to her the consciousness of being the object of a strong disinterested affection. And Avhere was noAv that love ?

She had a very clear perception also of Avhat Avould be the influence of these startling occur rences on current theories. That the man about whose antecedents there was 'something wrong,' should be immediately traced to his new home by one bent upon murdering him, would raise some thing more than a mere amiable inclination to congratulate him on his miraculous escape. All round, her outlook seemed very gloomy ; but whatever she might feel, the right course for her was clear; to bide her own feelings as much as possible ; to strive to cheer her father's gloomy depression; and to stand, as much as might be, betAveen him and condolences and inquiries which Avould simply be sharp criticism in masquerade.

Still the desolation's awfu' to think on.' With that Joan departed, and Isabel joined her father in the dining-room, Avhere breakfast was waiting. He was standing before the fire, Avith bis arm resting on the mantelpeice, and his head leaned upon it. ' Who was that you were talking to in the breakfast-room ? ' he asked. ' The housekeeper from Craignellan. She came to say that Mr. Moray died about midnight.' Mr. Elliott drew a long deep sort of sobbing sigh, but he made no remark, and Isabel made no mention of the request Joan had brought. She tried to speak on other subjects, but her father made little effort to aid her in keeping up a"], [41, "DUNCAN MORAY. 33 desultory conversation, and silence soon settled down upon them. 'If you take my advice, father,' she said, as she rose to leave the table, ' you will keep yourself well out of the way to-day.' 'Why?' 'Do you need to ask? Do you suppose that Avhere the carcase of a great sensation lies, the eagles will not be gathered together? ' ' Ah, I suppose so. And you, my dear child ! Shall you go out? ' ' No,' she answered, rather shortly. ' I shall stay and face it out.' ' It Avill be hard for you.' ' So are many things one has to do.'

Hoav could she better do that, than by resolutely hiding her own feelings, and appearing ready to discuss the tragedy with any one, and explain all the cir cumstances ; so that no element of mystery might, as far as she and her father were concerned, appear to enter into the case, and stimulate feverish thirst for information, AA'ith the fierce ex citement of some possible scandal, connected with Mr. Elliott, which this untoAvard event might yet bring to light. The resolution was heroic ; but once convinced it was the right thing to do, no thought of flinching crossed her mind. She had not miscalculated. She had a full dra-wing-room that day, and she faced it out, from first to last, with undaunted composure, appar ently unmoved either by Mrs. Fordyce's prompt improvement of the opportunity, Avith respect to the uncertainty of life, and the unsatisfactoriness of mere blameless living, without evidence of clear and distinct religious views; or by Mrs. Griersou's or Mrs. Millar's strange hypotheses, and irritating suggestions.

They all went away Avith little more to feel, if they did not actually say it, than that it was a mercy it was only an old farmer, and not a man of county importance, who had met Avith such a sad fate. But Isabel was very pale and worn, and there were very dark lines under her eyes, Avhen she and her father met at dinner. He looked at her almost Avith contrition. ' You have had a hard time of it, my child.' ' It is over. There is no one noAv but Lady Sinclair. I am not afraid of her. What she may say will not be wanting either in good sense or good feeling.' She started for Craignellan the following after noon, carrying a basket containing all the choicest flowers at her command.

He explained his presence at once, with the manly frankness which, more than any other quality he possessed, inspired the unhesitating confidence reposed in him by all who knew him.

' I thought ye Avould'nt mind my coming so far to meet ye,' he said. ' I'd nought particular to do just the now, an' it's ill work sitting alone brooding.

For all her ansAver, Isabel bent her head do-wn on the gate, and burst into tears. It was too"], [46, "38 DUNCAN MORAY. much for her overstrained endurance, this unex pected revelation that the dying man's last thoughts had been for her; that almost his last earthly effort had been to repair, as far as it could be repaired, that loss, the untold importance of which for her he had seemed even in that supreme moment to recognize, rendering it almost a solemn duty to the dead for her, should need arise, to seek the aid of the man to whom she had beeu intrusted, and who, in his simple untutored chivalry, had claimed her acceptance of his father's charge in words Avhich removed at once all diffidence, which she might otherwise have folt, about making any such appeal. There was a brief silence, only broken by the sobs she heroically strove to battle down. Then she felt Duncan Moray's hand laid almost hesi tatingly on her shoulder, and he said in a Ioav tremulous tone \u2014 ' Dinna greet sae sair, lassie. The past is gane, an' we canna call it back.

An' ye see, though I might partly do his bidding, whether ye will or no, I could na do it effectually, if ye'll no promise to trust me, as ye would have trusted him.' She raised her tearful face and held out her hand. ' I promise,' she said. ' I will look to you for aid, if I need it, as fearlessly as to your father. And I will trust to you for the descretion which was not needed in his case.' He pressed her hand firmly for a moment, then, without speaking, opened the gate, and they pursued their Avay in silence to the house, and up to the room where the dead man lay. Joan was standing just by the door, with some flowers in her hand. ' The young leddies frae the manse brocht these,' she said, with, it seemed to Isabel, a half frightened look.

But I wad na let them, sae they just left them wi' a heap o' messages I canna weel mind.' 'Ye've nae need,' replied Duncan, shortly. 'Ye did quite right.' ' An' will ye tak the flowers? 'No.' ' AVhat will I do wi' them, then ? ' ' Whatever ye please. Put them in the kitchen fire, if ye like. There's nae flowers to gae in my father's coffin, forbye what Miss Elliott hersel' puts there.' With that he opened the door, and motioned to Isabel to pass. Calm and peaceful, as if in slumber, the old man lay, -with bands folded on his breast; and quietly aud deftly Isabel per formed her task, Duncan Moray standing the while motionless beside the coffin, with the fierce expression settled down again upon his face, which had passed from it during their conversa tion. ' Thank you,' he said, when her task was accom plished. ' That does take off something o' the"], [49, "DUNCAN MORAY. 41 gloomy look, an' he was aye fond o' flowers.

I mean the touch o' yer hands wi' the floAvers, an' yer kiss, shall be the last mortal touch that shall rest upon him.' Isabel obeyed in silence, and then Duncan Moray walked with her as far as the door. There he paused. ' There's one thing, Miss Elliott,' he said, with a certain stiff constraint of manner. ' Of course the laird will have got a funeral letter. Ye'll please to tell him, I'll no expect to see him. I ken he'll no be able to walk without discomfort, an' seeing he is quite a stranger to my father there's no use in his being put to pain an' incon venience just for a useless compliment to him.' ' I Avill tell him,' she replied, as she turned away, and there was just the faintest possible shade of coldness in her tone, the outward indica tion of a slight stirring of resentment on her father's account. Duncan Moray had merely ex pressed a Avish to spare Mr. Elliott a ceremonial"], [50, "DUNCAN MORAY. 42 courtesy which, under all the circumstances, he would hardly have liked to neglect, in spite of the inconvenience it must have occasioned him. But through this outward seeming protruded, most unmistakably, the expression of a very distinct desire, on his part, that the laird should absent himself on the occasion. Only too evident did it seem that Mr. Elliott was the ultimate cause of the terrible catastrophe ; but surely the deep distress which that indisputable fact occasioned bim was quite enough, without a half stigma being attached to him, as though some direct blame rested on him. Poor Isabel, she was far quicker to perceive possible causes of undefined prejudice against her father, than to read the meaning of her own extreme sensitiveness upon the subject. It almost seemed as if Duncan Moray was minded with one hand to undo the gracious kindly acts of the other in requiring that she\u2014 the daughter of that house Avhose connection Avith the Morays had been so fatal to them \u2014 should be the one to pay the last tribute of loA^e to the man who, as her father had himself put it,"], [51, "DUNCAN MORAY. 43 might, but for some of his earlier errors, have been still alive and well. She gave the message with some little uneasiness, merely as a message which Mr. Moray had sent ; and not deterred by a sense of veracity from some what colouring up his anxiety to saA-e Mr. Elliott pain and inconvenience. To her great satisfaction, an expression of extreme relief came over her father's face. He at least did not see, or did not heed any ulterior motives. 'I am most thankful he acts so sensibly,' he said. 'I got the notice this morning. Of course I could have gone, though my sprain is not so entirely an imposture as to have enabled me to do so without inconvenience. Still, the Scotch are so particular on these points, I should have baldly dared to absent myself.

It was somewhat of a disappointment to Isabel Elliott's English ideas to feel that she must not be openly present at Adam Moray's funeral, and she was mournfully arranging the flowers she intended to take, herself, in the afternoon, to lay on the neAvly made grave, wheu, to her no small surprise, Lady Sinclair was announced. She came in dressed entirely in black. ' Oh,' she said, as she greeted Isabel, glancing at the flowers, ' I see you intend going to the funeral.' ' No, indeed. I wish I could. But I am told it is not the custom. I am going to the churchyard afterwards.' ' Stuff and nonsense. I thought how it might be, so made a groom drh^e me over in the dog-cart, that you might have someone to go with you. I should have gone, anyway, myself.

' Oh, dear,' exclaimed Isabel, in distress, ' and I have nothing black.' ' I thought of that. I have brought a hat of mine, and a long black ulster belonging to my maid. She is just about your height and size. The box is in the hall. Get ready at once. We shall not have much more than time to reach the churchyard before they come.' ' Hoav kind and good you are, Lady Sinclair.' 'I am not generally held to merit the latter adjective, my dear. But at auyrate I can appreciate goodness, aud I can feel for those Avho mourn.

He looks very haggard and worn.' 'Mr. Elliott,' said Lady Sinclair, in a tone of surprise. ' But he did not know Mr. Moray. Surely you are the one to feel it the most.' ' To feel the loss, perhaps, but not the shock. My father feels convinced that he Avas, himself, the intended victim. But even if not, he feels that the man Avould never probably have come into this neighbourhood but for his being here ; so he says he shall always feel as if he was, himself, Mr. Moray's murderer.' 'I see. Yes, it must be very painful,' Lady Sinclair replied, and she did not speak again for some time. 'Mither,' exclaimed Mrs. Hamilton's youngest hope, darting breathless into the house a short time after, ' there's Leddy Sinclair and Miss Elliott, a' in black, Avi' an aAvfu' heap o' floAvers, aAva' up the road to the kirk.

But Lady Sinclair did, and made a mental note. They Avaited quietly, standing a little apart, until the earth had been filled in upon the coffin of the murdered man, and then came fonvard to lay the Avreaths upon the newly made grave. Duncan Moray came back from among the slowly dis persing group of mourners, and stood beside them in silence. ' This is a great honour ye've done us, Leddy Sinclair,' he said, as she rose from hor knees, after arranging the floAvers to her mind, and silently hold out her hand to him, ' au' I thank ye frae my heart.

He raised bis hat as he spoke, and turned away. Lady Sinclair's eyes were full of tears as she watched him pass out of the churchyard gate and join the friends who were waiting for him outside. Isabel, too, was watching him, but there were no tears in her eyes. They were only large and grave and wistful."], [57, "DUNCAN MORAY. 49 CHAPTER TTI. LADY SINCLAIR'S HYPOTHESES. ' TYTILL you not send your man home, and stay and dine and sleep at Beechwood? ' Isabel asked as she and Lady Sinclair turned in at the lodge gates. ' We have horses now, though no carriage ; but as you do not mind a dogeart, we could easily get the loan of one for you to go back in to-morrow. I can find all you Avant for the night.' ' No, I must uot do that,' she replied. ' Sir Robert is not quite well. I should not like to be absent so long. But I am uot timorous about night driving, I Avill stay and dine Avith you, Avith pleasure. I told Sir Robert I might perhaps dine at the Rowans, so he Avas not to expect me until late to-night.'

' You must let me away then by ten o'clock. The night will not be dark. We shall do it in two hours. Let us go to the stables, I Avaut to see your horses, and I can tell my man when to be ready.' ' In the stable-yard they found Mr. Elliott, who Avas forthwith duly introduced. Was it fancy? Isabel wondered, or was Lady Sinclair's manner a shade more cold and constrained than she had yet seen it ? 'I am delighted to make the acquaiutance of the wife of my old antagouist,' Mr. Elliott said, laughing ; ' though, upon my word, Lady Sinclair, the mere sight of you inclines me to ache all over. I Avonder if Sir Robert has quite forgotten the awful thrashing he gave me ? ' ' By no means.

Sir Robert is not able to pay visits at a distance now, at least, so rarely, that he thinks it better to give up the practice entirely. And noAv let me see what you have been doing in horses.' Isabel stood silently by during the inspection, watching both her father and Lady Sinclair with interest. It seemed to her that the manner of neither was quite natural : a touch of overstrained courtesy on the one side, and a slight stiffening in the usual frank good nature in the other.' ' I fear you will not find either my daughter or myself very lively companions, Lady Sinclair,' Mr. Elliott said, as they strolled slowly back towards the house. 'This terrible catastrophe has been a very severe shock to both of us, and not inclined us to be very cheerful.' ' Of course, that is only natural.' ' It is a curious fragment of the great drama of life, is it not ? ' he Aveut on.

Then she said : ' It is useless speculating over these things. Some of the links in the chain are Avanting. Unless the man is caught, we are never likely to be able to supply them, and mere hypotheses are not links Avhich Avill stand much strain.' There Avas certainly a touch of coldness in her manner, and again Isabel Elliott experienced some stirrings of resentment on her father's behalf. That Duncan Moray should be perfectly fair towards him Avas more than could be reasonably expected, but there was no justification for other people seeming to imply that blame was due to him because boyish indiscretions of more than forty years ago had unexpectedly produced unhappy consequences, Avhich no one could have foreseen less than himself. If everyone was thus judged, for what might they not be held responsible? It Avas the old story \u2014 a dog with a bad name.

Rarely had Isabel felt so cordially drawn towards her father, as at that moment ; and she answered some remark that Lady Sinclair made to her with a touch of asperity in her tone which drew a quick penetrating glance upon her from the speaker. Mr. Elliott was standing alone in the drawing room, with his back to the fire, when Isabel came down before dinner, and under pressure of her generous partizanship she went up to him with more animation in her manner than was usual with her, when he was in question, and lightly clasping her hands on his arm, said : ' I hope I did right in asking her to stay to dinner? ' ' Unquestionably, my dear child,' Mr. Elliott said, laying his hand with a sort of caressing touch on her shoulder. ' Under any circumstances it would have been judicious; as it is, the results are most satisfactory. I like her very much. Do not you? ' Then he had not observed the manner, perhaps could not do so, having had no previous acquaint-"], [63, "DUNCAN MORAY. 55 ance with Lady Sinclair. Isabel was far too wise to betray herself. She answered readily. ' Yes, I do, more and more, as I come to know her better. She is a little wanting in refinement sometimes, but she is very kind, and so thoroughly genuine.' ' I suspect she has gone through a good deal of experience, which tends to rub off the finer edges of refinement ; but I am glad you like her, very glad. She Avill be a staunch true friend to you, should you ever need one.' He spoke with the emphasis of some strong undercurrent of unexpressed feeling, but Lady Sinclair's entrance at the moment prevented any further discussion. In the drawing-room, after dinner, Lady Sinclair soon contrived to reinstate herself in Isabel Elliott's good graces. 'My dear Miss Elliott,' she exclaimed, as soon as they were alone, ' Your father is surely terribly shaken ? ' ' There is no doubt of that.' ' Of course, not knowing him, it is difficult for me to judge accurately, but he has quite the"], [64, "DUNCAN MORAY. 56 appearance of a man who has had a severe shock. It is surely strange he should feel it so much? He does not look like a weak-nerved man.' ' He is very far from that ; but, whether he is right or Avrong, he holds to the belief that the man murdered Mr. Moray in mistake for him ; at least attacked him under that mistake. That is what he feels so keenly.' Lady Sinclair reflected for a short time in silence, with a slightly knitted brow. Then she said \u2014 ' I think you should try to get him away for a time.1 ' I had thought of that. Of course he cannot go for a little time, until it appears certain there is no chance of the man being caught. But, eAren then, I hardly know where to propose going.' She was sitting on a Ioav seat close beside Lady Sinclair's chair. Lady Sinclair laid her hand on her arm, and said earnestly \u2014 ' My dear girl, take my advice. Do not go with him yourself.

It Avas certainly AAdth a lightened heart that Isabel returned to the drawing-room, after seeing Lady Sinclair start for her long night drive. Into her cordial friendliness of manner there had come suddenly a touch of tenderness, and affectionate sympathy, Avhich was very grateful to the girl in her not newly-born, but newly-revived sense of loneliness. Lady Sinclair had at least one char acteristic in common Avith the Morays, she rang true. And the kiss and silent pressure of the hand Avith which she had bade her young hostess good night, had done more to cheer her than anything which had happened since the terrible night of the murder. She told her father of Lady Sinclair's proposition, as soon as he followed her back to the drawing room ; and she caught the look of relief that crossed his face. 'It is an excellent suggestion for us both, Isabel,' he said. 'I have been feeling I could not face the whole Avinter here, and it is perfectly true that I could find more distraction for my thoughts alone than if you were with me, while you will certainly"], [67, "DUNCAN MORAY. 59 find more diversion at Heathfield. Lady Sinclair is a very sensible Avoman.' ' She said she saAV you were terribly shaken.' ' How can she tell ? ' he asked, with a frown. ' She never saw me before.' ' She said you had all the appearance of having had a very severe shock.' He Avas silent for a moment, but the frown deepened. ' A shock which has astonished me more than anyone else,' he said, at last. ' I begin to understand the feelings, now, of a reck less rider, who after some years out of the saddle finds, to his amazement, he does not like the look of even a light fence. The iron nerves of my younger days have become terribly relaxed during my humdrum life of London decorum. You will soon have a doited old father to take care of, Isabel.' She kissed him with more than usual warmth, and Avishing him good night, left the room rather abruptly. His words brought back too strongly the first conversation at Craignellan.

Lady Sinclair was sitting opposite to him, employing about tAvo minutes out of every ten, upon some fancy work, and for the rest of her time gazing meditatively into the fire. ' A penny for your thoughts, Bertha,' he said at last. ' They are worth a great deal more than that.' ' I do not mind going as far as sixpence.' She dreAv a heavy sigh, aud her face half saddened as she rose from her seat, and drawing a low stool beside Sir Robert's arm-chair, sat down close beside him. Her husband seemed to under stand the action. He gently smoothed her hair Avith his hand, and let his arm fall carelessly round her shoulders.

The face seems familiar to me, and to be connected with something pain ful ; still I cannot recall anything distinctly. But 0, Robert, he is a bad one.

But the idea of a man of his type being so much affected because an old man he never saAv in his life Avas murdered in mistake for him, is a little too much.' ' Well, but you surely do not suspect him of having murdered Mr. Moray himself,' said Sir Robert, laughing. ' As the old man had a son, one's Avildest conjectures cannot hit upon a motive.' ' I should have been strongly inclined to suspect that instead of this man Carfrae having murdered Mr. Moray in mistake for Mr. Elliott, it Avas Mr. Elliott murdered him in mistake for Carfrae, were it not for the old man's own testimony to the fact that he clearly saw aud recoguised Carfrae. But how came the man to be at that exact spot just at the right moment?

Of course it is impossible to do anything more than surmise ; but that he knows more than he is supposed to knoAv, I feel convinced.' Sir Robert meditated for a little in silence. ' Certainly,' he said, after a little, ' the fact that the man Avas lying in wait, at that exact spot, is a point which needs elucidation. But I don't suppose anything more will ever be heard about it.' 'Not unless the man is caught, which, for the poor girl's sake, may heaven forbid. It would kill her, I think, if anything of that sort came to light. I doubt if she has the faintest suspicion that her father is not now everything that a man of his age and position should be.' 'You must try and get her married.' ' Just what I mean to do. I made another discovery, Robert. There are the elements of a magnificent tragedy floating about. Duncan Moray adores her.'

A CURT REB U FF. ' T7\"ES, indeed,' said Mrs. Fordyce, drinking tea in the drawing-room at Beechwood, 'We all think it very strange. I have heard many remarks made on the subject myself. Duncan Moray always professed such extreme affection for his father, and yet he seems perfectly apathetic about the subject of the murder. He does not show the least anxiety, even, that the murderer should be caught, and brought to justice. I think it very inconsistent, and most unnatural, but Duncan Moray was never a favourite of mine, I must admit.' She spoke Avith a good deal of asperity. As she had Avalked up the drive with her eldest daughter, she had seen Peter, who was working near the house, go towards it hastily, on catching sight ot her; and on entering the drawing-room, where she"], [78, "70 DUNCAN MORAY. found Miss Elliott alone, her sharp eyes instantly lighted upon a half finished cup of tea, standing amid a litter of papers and magazines, on a small table near the fire, from which a large easy chair appeared to have been pushed back. She had drawn her own deductions, and her moral condi tion, at the moment, was not such as to bode that the lash would be lightly applied to any back slidings on the part of the parishioners of Rossan. Isabel answered with icy coldness. ' You must be an exception to general rules, I think. I doubt if anyone else ever heard Mr. Moray profess anything- at all about his father. Old Mr. Moray himself was not slow to speak of his son's extraordinary devotion to him, and the fact was patent to everyone who knew them well. But I never heard of any protestations on the son's part.' ' Perhaps not,' replied Mrs. Fordyce tartly, ' but then you have known the neighbourhood less than six months, while I have known it for some thirty years.' ' That makes a difference, certainly,' replied"], [79, "DUNCAN MORAY. 71 Isabel, smiling at the point her adversary had scored. ' But when a man has been a devoted son throughout his father's life, he may surely be left to do as he pleases, unmolested, after his death.' ' Oh, certainly. I am sure I have no wish to interfere with him. But I cannot help having my own opinion, all the same. And I know it is shared by a great many other people.' It was of the nature of the precious balms of Mrs. Fordyce's administering, that they had a tendency to break the head of the recipient, which fact affords evidence of the continuity of human characteristics. Isabel Elliott felt much irritated by her remarks, all the more because she was inwardly conscious that there was some colouring for them. She had seen very little of Duncan Moray since the day of his father's funeral, but in his whole action, from the first moment, a strong and only too fatally justified conviction that the old man had been murdered, seemed to be linked with a strange apathy regarding any efforts to bring the murderer to justice. Yet none could note his aged worn face, and almost stern constraint"], [80, "72 DUNCAN MORAY. of manner, and doubt that the blow which had fallen upon him was as cruel a one as it ever taxed the strength of a strong man to bear. A fortnight had passed since the murdered man had been laid in his grave, and Mr. Elliott was no longer a stranger in Rossan, at least in appearance. Both on foot and on horseback he had been often seen in the village and neighbourhood, and his dark, aud certainly not genial face, and somewhat cold reserve of manner, had not made a favour able impression. The ordinary mind runs more to omens than logic, and not wholly without argu ments to support its position. It was felt to be a sort of omen that Mr. Elliott, with suspicious antecedents to start with, should have been thus immediately on his arrival at Beechwood, the accidental cause of the murder of a much respected dweller in the neighbourhood. The oldest in habitants were all prepared to affirm, as the result of their recollections of the personal reminiscences of those who had actually seen the wicked Colonel, that Mr. Elliott was more like him, both in face"], [81, "DUNCAN MORAY. 73 and ways, than any previous successor of that re nowned sinner had been. ' I think we might begin to prepare for a move now, Isabel,' he said to his daughter one evening. ' There cannot, now, be the least chance anything more will ever transpire about this unhappy business. I think we might go to Heathfield early next week, and 1 could go on from thence to Paris a few days later.' 'I will write to Lady Sinclair to-morrow, and propose it,' she answered. ' But mind, father, I do not pledge myself to stay there until you choose to come back. I like Lady Sinclair, but I am by no means so certain I shall like her house. If I do not I shall return here.' 'It seems a strange supposition that this gloomy house, in the dead of winter, could possibly be more attractive to you than Heathfield. But I have only one wish, my dear child, that you should be as happy as I can make you, so please yourself. I would suggest your joining me abroad, in such a case, if I thought you would like it. If any such"], [82, "74 DUNCAN MORAY. wish should come to you, Isabel, you have only to write to me, and I will arrange it at once.' ' You are very kind, father,' she answered, 'but if I do not stay at Heathfield, I think I would rather return here. It is such a new sensation to me to have a home, in the sense in which Beech wood is home to an Elliott, that I do not as yet feel disposed to stray far away.' She spoke with a slight feeling of contrition, for she felt that her declaration of independence had been a trifle aggressive in tone, and her father's reply had brought to her a renewed perception of the fact that be had not failed to show of late, in sundry ways, that his expressed desire to do more than he had hitherto done to promote her happi ness had been no mere idle phrase. ' There is one thing, Isabel, I should very much like to do, before I leave Beechwood. But I think I shall not be able to manage it without your help.' 'What is that?' ' Well,' he replied, speaking with evident effort, ' there is only one way in which I can make any sort of reparation, to myself, for whatever uninten-"], [83, "DUNCAN MORAY. 75 tional share I may have had in the death of that old man ; and, after the manner of the world in general,' he added, with a bitter smile, ' I meditate doing it more at the expense of someone else, than of myself. I want at once to make over the Rig Mains to Mr. Duncan Moray, without any further questioning about the matter. ' Oh, father,' \u2014 and there she paused abruptly \u2014 her first delighted sense of the vindication of her father's character, by evidence that he was pre pared to be not merely just, but generous, checked by the sudden question : ' Would Duncan Moray hear of any such proposal ? ' ' Well ? You did not think I had so much good in me I suppose. But the question is, how I am to put the matter in train ? I confess I do not care for a personal interview with this man. I can quite understand his feelings, and it would be painful to me. Do you think you can be negotiator of the business, Isabel ? ' ' I rarely or ever meet him, and I could not ask him to come here \u2014 to come up that road.'"], [84, "76 DUNCAN MORAY. 'No, no. Clearly out of the question. But could you not see him at his own house ? ' 'I hai-dly like to go there now, father. You know Mr. Moray is comparatively a young man, and he is not married.' ' Exactly, and I should be the last person to wish you should make a practice of going there. But I do not think, under the peculiar circumstances, an appointment made with my full cognizance, really to transact business on my account, would be open to objection, as I understand Mr. Moray is a man of reputable life, and honourable character. I am very anxious to settle the business before I leave, and I see no other way.' ' Very well. I will arrange to see him at once. I am very glad you are going to make the sugges tion. Whatever comes of it, it will at least show that you are more under the influence of honour able feelings than previous Elliotts have been.' ' Pshaw, Isabel,' he answered, irritably. 'Don't go off with any such sentimental nonsense in your head. I am simply a victim to a remorse which is about as logical as if I blamed myself because a"], [85, "DUNCAN MORAY. 77 gun which had once belonged to me burst and killed some man ; but 1 cannot shake it off. I merely want to do something which I may think of as a sort of consolation, and, as I said, at your expense.' She was silent. Was this half contemptuous repudiation of the right motive for doing the right thing really a genuine expression of sentiment, or was he merely posturing as a cynic, out of dread of being thought to posture as an exceptionably honourable character? She could not tell, but fate seemed to have decreed that whenever her father touched her with some manifestation of tenderness, he should immediately after succeed in undoing the result by repelling her with some especially repugnant sentiment. She had n ever set out for Craignellau with so much reluctance as on the day she had appointed for the interview. It seemed, now, as if there was scarcely any possible element of pain which did not mingle in the question of the disputed land, and she felt a positive dread of broaching the subject of her father's intentions, with Duncan Moray."], [86, "78 DUNCAN MORAY. He met her himself at the door of the house, with a cordial, but deferential welcome. 'I'm proud to see ye here again, Miss Elliott,' he said. ' I was wearying for a sight o' ye, for Gillespie told me ye were for away soon, an' I feared I might'nt see ye again.' ' I should not have gone without wishing you goodbye. But one never sees you about now.' ' No, that's true. Save to Kirkness on market days, I've scarce been off the farm since the day o' my father's funeral. There's a heap o' folk I've no seen yet, since it happened, an' I doubt it's like the pain o' a wound, getting worse as it begins to cool. I seem to shrink every day more from the thought o' meeting auld acquaintances.' ' But it cannot be good for you to shut yourself up here. It must be fearfully lonely.' ' Lonely ! Have ye any notion what it is ? ' he said bitterly. 'But a man should face the fate that's laid on him, an' no complain. I've no mind to run about whining an' lamenting. I can bear wi'out crying out. What I can't face is a heap o' silly questions. One would think, to hear people"], [87, "DUNCAN MORAY. 79 talk, it's no my father's death I should be troubled about so much as bringing his murderer to justice.' ' Yes,' said Isabel, hesitating a little. ' I know some people have thought you seemed a little indifferent about that. Sometimes I have wished you had shown a little more anxiety about it ; just that there may not seem the least disrespect to your father's memory.' ' I know better than you or anyone else how to honour my father's memory.' The words were so shortly and sternly spoken that Isabel could not repress a start. But ere she had time to reply, he continued, jn a gentler tone. 'I'd give my right hand to bring the man to justice, but it's no possible. I know that, an' I wouldn't say but it's nigh on the heaviest part o' my burden to know he's got off scot free. But like a' the rest, that's a sorrow must be borne. There's no a soul could swear to the man, if he was caught ; an' I think it would drive me fair mad if some innocent man got suspected, an' could'nt clear himsel'. I seem to breathe freer every day that passes an' no one laid hold of.'"], [88, "80 DUNCAN MORAY. ' There seems little chance of that now, so my father thinks it is not necessary for him to stay here any longer. This has been a terrible shock aud distress to him also, Mr. Moray.' ' No doubt. It couldn't but be that to any man ; but, I suppose, it was no that he wished ye to come an' tell me ? ' ' No,' replied Isabel, hesitating. She had never felt so ill at ease in Duncan Moray's company. He darted a keen glance at her, and then, assuming a more cordial manner, though with evident effort, he said. ' Ye must tell me what it is then. Ye must for- give me if I seem rather short. If ye'd lost yer own father in such a way, Miss Elliott, ye'd find it no easy not to be hard an' bitter.' ' I know, I know,' she replied eagerly, ' and it makes me very glad we are going away, so that there may be nothing to remind you. My father quite understands too. That is why he did not like to seek an interview with you. But he wishes more than ever, now, to settle about the laud before he leaves.'"], [89, "DUNCAN MORAY. 81 ' I'll no hear a word o' that, Miss Elliott.' 'No, but you do not understand. My father does not wish there should be any discussion at all about the matter. He wishes to have title-deeds made out at once, and the land handed over to you without a single further word about it.' Duncan Moray passed his hand over his eyes for a moment in silence. Then he asked : ' Was that all the laird wished ye to say to me?' < Yes, all.' ' Very well. I'll no send an answer by you. I'll send down a note.' 'My father will be seeing Mr. Dempster to morrow afternoon,' Isabel said, with some hesita- tion. ' He shall have a note by breakfast time. ' Then, I had better say good-bye, Isabel said, rising. ' We are going away early next week.' 'I'll walk across the field wi' ye,' he replied. ' There's a new gate, an' it's a bit stiff to open.' ' For how long will ye be away ?

I was so happy before alone at Beechwood, I thought I should never care to be long away. But now, I am not quite certain. I think it would be very different now.' He did not answer, did not speak again until they had reached the gate, and he had opened it for her. Then he detained the hand she gave him, and said in a low, earnest voice : ' Ye'll no carry away an ill memory o' me, Miss Elliott, will ye ? I've no treated ye the day as I fain would have done, no as my fatber would approve. But ye'll forgive me, will ye no. I've been sorely tried, an' whiles the thought o' it a' gets the better o' me. Ye'll no go back from yer promise to trust me as ye would have trusted him because I seem a bit short in the temper whiles.' ' How can you ask such a question ? Do you think I have no feeling? I do not believe I shall ever trust anyone as I trust you.' ' Ye'll never repent it. I'm glad ye're to be away for a while.

Craignellan's a sad, lonely place now, an' I'll feel it the worse for there being no chance to meet ye once in a while, or to know that there's one near at hand loved my father so well, an' can understand something o' what my sorrow is.' Could Lady Sinclair have seen the look in Duncan Moray's eyes then, she would not have given Isabel Elliott five minutes' grace, had he chosen, then and there, to ask her to come and brighten his lonely lot. But Isabel saw nothing. Her own eyes were far too dim with tears. She only answered by a warm pressure of the hand she held, then hastily withdrawing hers, she turned away and hurried down the hill. A note addressed in Duncan Moray's hand to Mr. Elliott was on the table when she came down to breakfast the next morning. Her father shortly followed, and taking it up, opened and read it as he stood on the hearthrug with his back to the fire. His most sardonic smile was on his face as he replaced it in its envelope, and tossing it on to the table by his daughter's side, remarked :"], [92, "84 DUNCAN MORAY. 'I cannot say your friend's manners are sugges tive of the highest possible breeding. I think my proposal merited somewhat less abrupt treatment.' Isabel took up the note in silence. It was very brief. Duncan Moray merely coldly thanked Mr. Elliott for the proposition communicated by Miss Elliott, and begged, once for all, to decline accepting it, or any other proposal with respect to the Rig Mains. It was certainly not a gracious epistle, and Isabel felt her resentment stir a little again. ' You must not be hard upon him, father. It has been a fearful blow to him, and all the cir cumstances are exceptionally painful. I fear we have made a mistake. I was afraid so from his manner yesterday. I fear he looks upon it as a sort of attempt on your part to offer him compen sation.' ' Compensation ! For what ? Good Lord ! ' exclaimed Mr. Elliott, in a startled tone, ' I never thought of the possibility of such a thing ! Surely he could not suppose I had any such idea ! Yet I do not know. Perhaps you may be right. I"], [93, "DUNCAN MORAY. 85 believe I was looking so much at the subject from my own point of view that I quite forgot his was a different one. I am awfully sorry if I have made such a mistake.' ' It might have been better to wait. A very sore heart is not always a very reasonable one. Perhaps we are all a little too much under the in fluence- of the shock yet, to see things quite clearly.' ' What shall I do ? Shall I write some ex pression of regret ? ' ' Oh, no, no, that would only make bad worse.' On whatever point Isabel might be doubtful, she was very confident of being in the right in pre venting her father from making the least attempt to communicate in any way with Duncan Moray. ' Very well. You know the man, I do not, I will be guided by you. I confess I cannot altogether regret, first that you will not be a loser, second that I am spared all need for further com munication with so impracticable an individual. Thank heaven that detestable land question is settled now, for ever. After such a curt refusal of"], [94, "86 DUNCAN MORAY. my offer, the idea of it ever being entertained again would be a palpable absurdity. Give me that note, Isabel. It is a document which should be carefully preserved. If any future Moray should take it into his head to hold himself aggrieved because that question is not allowed to go on simmering until the crack of doom, he will have to blame his own ancestors, not the Elliotts.' With a somewhat heavy heart, Isabel set about the task of dismantling the sombre old home of all the decorations which, during the summer, she had spent so many quietly happy hours in arrang ing, and in storing away in darkness such house hold gods as she had dared to intrude upon the grim solemnity of the old furniture which had always seemed to her to be silently and mockingly, crying out to her, ' We could tell you a great deal about your ancestors which you do not, and never will know ! We could tell you whether that story about the missing paper is true or not ? ' By the evening of the day prior to that fixed for their departure, her task was done, and the rooms all wore much the same hard unlovely aspect which"], [95, "DUNCAN MORAY. 87 they had worn on the day on which she first entered the house. ' You have made a great clearance, Isabel,' Mr. Elliott said, when he joined her in the drawing room after dinner, with a ring of sarcasm in his voice. It does not look as if you had much faith in being drawn back, by Arcadian yearnings, from the modern glitter of Heathfield, to the lonely gloom of Beechwood in the dead of winter. By the way, though, I have a parcel for you here, which was thrust upon me by a small boy, as I came up the drive this afternoon. I could not find you when I came in, and I forgot it after wards.' He took from his pocket, and handed to her a small packet, addressed in Duncan Moray's hand. 'That is the fist of your somewhat short-tempered friend at Craignellan, I think. I have not the least doubt of your discretion, Isabel, but you will do well to remember that, socially, you and Mr. Moray are somewhat in the ' so near and yet so far ' position. A man of his stamp is quite able, and not unfrequently fatally apt to appreciate"], [96, "88 DUNCAN MORAY. keenly a woman of superior advantages in the way of education and refinement. It is for his sake, not for yours, that I would suggest you should be specially guarded in your treatment of him.' Isabel reddened suddenly, and then grew very pale ; but she made no further reply than hastily to unfasten the parcel. On an inner paper was simply written, ' Please accept enclosed, D. M.' A small but remarkably good likeness of Adam Moray lay within the papers. She handed the whole thing to her father, saying laughingly, ' You can see for yourself, that his communications are both cold and laconic' Mr. Elliott took the parcel from her hand, with a slightly surprised look. Then, as he saw what it contained, he made a quick, sudden movement, and half turning in his chair, to catch the full light from the lamp, he closely scrutinized the likeness. ' I suppose it is old Mr. Moray,' he said. ' Is it a good likeness, Isabel ? ' ' Very good.' ' Strange,' said Mr, Elliott. ' I seem to know"], [97, "DUNCAN MORAY. 89 that face. I must have seen him somewhere, at sometime. Was he ever abroad, do you know ? ' ' In Australia.' ' Oh yes, of course. But my wanderings never took me so far as that. I mean in any part of Europe. Save a brief excursion into Asia Minor, I was never out of Europe in my life.' ' I never heard him speak of having been abroad. Indeed, until his death, I never knew that he had been in Australia.' ' Well. It may be only a likeness, but certainly I should say I have met that man somewhere. The communication is a harmless one, unquestion ably; still, my dear child, you will do well to bear my caution in mind. You must remember, Isabel, that you are of a type far more likely to excite a deep absorbing passion in the breast of a manly, straightforward fellow of the Moray class, than to attract the dancing society men you meet in Lon don ball-rooms. The danger, in such a case, is one your experience of life hardly enables you to discern. Mr. Moray has cause enough to rue our families ever having come in contact with each"], [98, "90 DUNCAN MORAY. other. Don't give him cause to rue it far more deeply and bitterly.' He left the room as he spoke, having done, from his point of view, about as much mischief as men generally do manage to accomplish, when they take upon them to handle such fragile topics. He had suggested to his daughter the occupation of critically analyzing men of the Moray type, to whom he had pronounced her attractive, and con trasting them sharply against those dancing men whom he had declared her unlikely to attract. No end could have been further from his wish and intention, and the mistake was not one he would have been likely, under ordinary circumstances, to make. But the possibility which had suddenly presented itself before him confused his thoughts, and upset his judgment."], [99, "DUNCAN MORAY. 91 CHAPTER V. LOCAL THEORIES. ' QO the Elliotts come to-morrow I understand,' Sir Robert Sinclair said to his wife, when they were left alone after dinner, on that same evening during which Mr. Elliott turned his daughter's thoughts all unwittingly in a new direction. ' Yes, they will be here by dinner time.' ' And are we to make a family party, Bertha ? That will hardly be inspiriting for them.' ' Oh dear, no. Sundry people are coming and going. And I am going to ask Walter Millar and one of his sisters to come and stay for some time.' ' My dear Bertha, your audacity positively takes my breath away ! After the way you have treated those people, have you the effrontery to ask, or the cool assurance to expect they will come and stay here?"], [100, "DUNCAN MORAY. 92 ' They would not, if he had as much strength as he has spirit, but he has not.

Mrs. Millar had hardly been able to conceal her flutter of delighted anticipation when she received Lady Sinclair's note, proposing to drive over and lunch with her, as she was anxious to enlist her good nature in the cause of a common friend. News did not travel more slowly in the Rossan district than in other like districts, and Mrs. Millar had been speedily informed that Lady Sinclair had driven over in a dog-cart to Beechwood, had accompanied Miss Elliott to Mr. Moray's funeral, and had spent the rest of the day with her. The common friend, Mrs. Millar assumed, could be no one save Miss Elliott. But what could Lady Sinclair possibly want to say to her on that subject ? However, she was coming in quite an informal"], [101, "DUNCAN MORAY. 93 way, which seemed almost to indicate possibilities of intimacy. That was enough. Lady Sinclair vaunted the advantages of audac ity, the truth being that no other tactics was open to her. She was, by nature, far too blunt and out spoken for any sort of ' craft or subtility.' Where such qualities were needed, she did not succeed. So, without circumlocution, as soon as she and Mrs. Millar were alone in the drawing-room after luncheon, she said : ' You must wonder what I want to say to you, but the fact is my note was a trifle misleading. I did not deem it expedient to be more explicit in writing. But I am meditating a daring interference in your family affairs, which I feel would be utterly unjustifiable unless I ascer tain your sentiments beforehand.' ' You certainly puzzle me greatly,' Mrs. Millar said. ' Well, to come to the point. The question is : Would you and Mr. Millar have any objection to Miss Elliott as a daughter-in-law ? ' Mrs. Millar uttered a faint exclamation. To have this pet scheme thus coolly suggested as a possi-"], [102, "DUNCAN MORAY. 94 bility, by Lady Sinclair, was a sort of mental electric shock. ' I like her extremely,' she said at length, not choosing to show too much of her own hand until she saw more of her companion's game. ' I am very glad to hear it, as I hope it augurs well for my little scheme. I like Miss Elliott my self, very much, and her position is not a very satisfactory one. I should much like to see her well married. But then I fear her fortune will be very small. So few men in a suitable position for her can afford to marry without regard to fortnne. You son is more lucky. He is free to choose where he pleases, without having to take account of mercenary considerations.' ' Certainly he is,' replied Mrs. Millar, expanding as Lady Sinclair thus clearly unfolded her projects ; ' and I may frankly say that if his choice fell upon Miss Elliott, it would be a great satisfaction both to Mr. Millar and myself.' 'Presuming that he could induce Miss Elliott to regard him with favour,' added Lady Sinclair, with a slight intonation which Mrs. Millar was not quick"], [103, "DUNCAN MORAY. 95 enough to catch. All unconsciously, however, she at once humbled herself. 'Exactly. My eldest daughter and I have spoken of such a possibility. Helen is very shrewd. She says Walter has not a chance.' ' What leads Miss Millar to this conclusion ? ' ' Well, I think chiefly because she says Walter is not strong enough.' ' Oh,' said Lady Sinclair, with difficulty repress ing a smile. ' I suppose she thinks Miss Elliott woitld require a sort of Young Lochinvar wooing. Well, though perhaps you will smile at such an assertion, under the circumstances, I am no match maker. But it is really so. My intervention never goes beyond just giving young people good chances of finding out if they have a fancy for each other ; and thinking that this would be a case in which it would be worth trying, I thought I would consult you. I should not like to move actively in bringing a girl into any family without being sure she would be welcome.' ' She would be most welcome in ours,' said Mrs. Millar, warming into enthusiasm. ' We like her"], [104, "96 DUNCAN MORAY. very much. Mr. Millar was particularly taken with her. And, as you say, fortune is of no conse quence. Mr. Millar has always said, that if Walter made a match he approved he would give up Southend to him, and buy some other place for himself. 1 am sure, in this case, he would do it with most hearty good will.' ' Very well. Then we must now begin to dis semble, and that is why I worded my note as I did. This terrible catastrophe at Beechwood has of course been a great shock to both Mr. and Miss Elliott. I strongly urged upon them leaving the place altogether for a time, and it has been settled that Mr. Elliott shall go abroad, and Miss Elliott come and stay for some time with me. I expect them to-moiTow. I shall ask your son and one of your daughters to come on a visit to Heathfield, on the plea of their prior acquaintance with Miss Elliott enabling them to help me to amuse and divert her. The rest must follow. You must play into my hands.' ' Indeed I will. And please ask my younger daughter, Laura. She and Miss Elliott drew more"], [105, "DUNCAN MORAY. 97 together than was the case with Helen. And Laura and Walter have always been fast friends.' ' Very good. I shall send invitations im mediately. Poor Miss Elliott is really very much shaken. She had formed quite an affection for old Mr. Moray.' ' Yes, indeed. I confess I was more than sur prised at the terms they were on. I thought it a little, well, defiant of Miss Elliott. It was the only thing which made me a little doubtful about her.' ' Oh, well, you know,' replied Lady Sinclair, with praiseworthy gravity, ' old Mr. Moray was a very exceptional man. You will not often, in any circle, come across one just like him.' ' Indeed ? I never saw him that I know of.' ' No, of course he did not come in your way at all ; but he was greatly respected by all who knew him. Now be sure you do not give a hint to any one, save Mr. Millar, of what is on the carpet, or you will ruin all.' With that they parted, making mutual com ments on their subsequent reflections. ' What a 2 G"], [106, "98 DUNCAN MORAY. difference in the woman when she is interested enough to forget herself, and be easy and natural, and give up behaving properly,' Lady Sinclair said to herself. ' Lady Sinclair is much pleasanter in a friendly visit, such as she made to-day, than in society,' Mrs. Millar reported at dinner. ' She is blunt and outspoken, but not nearly so domineering aud abrupt' 'My prescription has not been long in beginning its work,' Lady Sinclair said to Isabel that evening, after they had left the dining-room. Your father looks brighter already.' ' Yes indeed. He seemed to brighten up before we were many miles from Beechwood,' she answered. But later at night, Lady Sinclair appeared, as she often did, in her husband's dressing-room, and seating herself on an easy chair, she asked \u2014 ' Well, what is your verdict ? ' ' I never came across a case in which the child was so completely father to the man. He is in credibly little altered. I really think I should"], [107, "DUNCAN MORAY. 99 have known him, and I do not think he can have been more than thirteen the last time I saw him.' ' I suspect it is the type you recognise. It is often very strongly marked in those old families, especially when they are strong characters. Generation after generation, existing under just the same conditions, must have an influence. But what of the type as I meant it, the social type ? ' Sir Robert shook his head. ' It is quite as strongly marked as the other. You will certainly do well, Bertha, if you get that poor girl safely married off as soon as possible. I should say in finite possibilities of disaster were suspended over her head by a very slender cord. How long does her estimable father remain? ' ' Only till the day after to-morrow.' ' She is handsome, certainly. Might you not do better for her than this Millar connection ? ' ' I am playing at worldly wisdom. Should that sword ever descend with special force, still Walter Millar remains \u2014 I have been picking up informa tion \u2014 the grandson of a workhouse boy, allied with some of the bluest blood in all Scotland. It"], [108, "100 DUNCAN MORAY. would be different if her husband had a waggon load of grandfathers of his own. I have a strong impression that sword will descend some day. Therefore I act as I am doing.' ' Humph ! There is something in that, certainly, and unquestionably women of very high type do contrive to go through life very contentedly, tied to most commonplace men, so perhaps it may answer well enough. Though I am by no means certain, Bertha, that the Millars are quite the sort of people to be depended on for generous action, if that particular sword did descend.' 'Perfectly ideal matches are not to be found in this world, Robert. There is always something to be risked. Neither, in truth, am I going to try and make the match. I am merely going to give them the chance to make it for themselves, if it so pleases them.' ' What do you think I have done for you ? ' she said to Isabel, the next day. ' Something very good-natured, I have no doubt' ' I have asked your dear friends the Millars ;"], [109, "DUNCAN MORAY. 101 that is to say, Walter Millar and his younger sister, to come and stay here.' ' Have they accepted ? ' The emphasis of Miss Elliott's intonation might almost have suggested to Lady Sinclair that the acceptance of the invitation would not further her schemes. But she only laughed heartily, her clear, merry, though slightly unrefined laugh. ' They come to-morrow. But you must not therefore think ill of them. Those two members of the family do not merit your superb disdain, my dear. Had I merely asked them, in the ordinary course, to pay a visit here, I am certain I should have met with an instant rebuff. I represented to them how much you had gone through, and plainly asked them to come and help me to amuse you, and divert your attention from the painful shock you have had. I can assure you the answers I received dwelt with most edifying frankness on their sympathy with you, and readiness to do any thing in their power to aid you in any way.' ' And with your wide circle of acquaintances, why in the world have you pitched upon them ? '"], [110, "102 DUNCAN MORAY. A little mild dissimulation was not beyond Lady Sinclair's powers, and she replied, readily enough. ' Firstly, you already know them, and I know that you have a friendly feeling for them ; and one can never tell how such a logical and keenly critical young person may take people. Secondly, they suit me because of Sir Robert's uncertain health. His tendency is rather to ill-developed gout, and he often feels ill and out of humour for playing host when one can hardly say there is much the matter. Of course he is not bound to pay so much attention to a young fellow of Mr. Millar's age, as to older men. I never, now, ask men who may be any tax upon him, for more than a two days' visit. She will be a companion for you, and he will make a good escort. There will be plenty of other people coming and going, so I hope you will not find it dull.' ' After Beechwood ? ' ' Heathfield is not Beechwood, my dear. It has no past to speak of. The thousand, phantoms of byegone centuries are not always whispering into your spiritual ears weird legends of the past, so"], [111, "DUNCAN MORAY. 103 faintly that the sound is overwhelmed by the trivialities of the present, and you only dimly reproduce them in your dreams. You might feel oppressed, if your nerves were weak, even become a prey to superstitious terrors at Beechwood ; but I cannot fancy your feeling mere dulness, such as you would feel here, if you were alone, and the weather was bad.' 'What strange ideas you have ! ' 'For a middle-aged, unromantic woman? yes. But everyone who is not hopelessly, stupidly, devoid of imagination, has a vein of romance somewhere, which will occasionally crop up in unexpected places. You will come, in time, to appreciate the difference I have pointed out' So Mr. Elliott went his way, and the Millars came and stayed, while many other guests came and went. Isabel Elliott could not but admit that Heathfield Castle was a very pleasant winter sojourn \u2014 a place where every one did as he pleased, and where the guiding hand of the mis tress was so deftly used that its interference was perceived only in an apparently fortuitous con-"], [112, "104 DUNCAN MORAY. currence of pleasant experiences, and harmonious associations. None the less, an undercurrent of disquieting perceptions somewhat shadowed Isabel Elliott's enjoyment of the most inspiriting and brightest spell of existence she had ever known. The mercury in her spiritual barometer had risen again, and every fresh experience of its rises and falls indicated for her, more and more strongly, the fact that they depended solely on one condi tion \u2014 the presence or absence of her father. Apart from all consideration of the recent tragedy, she could not be blind to the only conclusion deducible from the results of their few weeks of isolated existence at Beechwood. Their natures were in some way antagonistic. It had only needed enforced and continuous companionship to bring that antagonism into prominence, and that prominence seemed now to be almost more pain fully emphasized by negation. A weight seemed to be lifted off her the moment he had left Heath field. And her more vivid perception of this antagonism was coincident with a manifestation"], [113, "DUNCAN MORAY. 105 on his part of far more parental affection than he had ever before shown towards her, with, indeed, an assumption, at times, of an attitude towards her which was almost imploring, as though he were mutely beseeching her to respond to his warmer sentiments. That it should be so brought her a sensation almost approaching remorse. Yet where was there room for any rude feeling ? Love could not be forced. She knew she had strenuously exerted herself to do for him all that affection would have prompted. She could do no more than that. To seek to win and hold his love was a duty she owed to him whose almost last thought of earth had been for her ; but she was beginning to perceive that the happiness he had prophesied as the result for both, would not be for her. She might and would strive to be the best of daughters, but it would always be a striving, an effort to do the right, in spite of repelling force preventing her from doing it spontaneously, as the outcome of natural feeling. And, unless she married, a contingency which did not bulk largely in Isabel Elliott's day-dreams,"], [114, "106 DUNCAN MORAY. those few weeks spent with her father at Beech wood would be, less the tragic element, fairly representative of the whole future course of her life, so long as he lived. In that very clearly defined prospect lay, perhaps, the strongest force at work in favour of Lady Sinclair's schemes. Walter Millar showed to more advantage at Heathfield, than at Southend. The total absence of the skeletons of home gave more ease and brightness to his manner, and Sir Robert Sinclair, not being a woman blunted into some coarseness by hardening experiences, was quite incapable of any such manifestations as those which had roused Isabel's wrath so fiercely at Southend, so Walter was more at home with him. He was very commonplace, there was no doubt about that ; but he was a straightforward, kindly-natured young fellow, and those characteristics were important under the existing phase of circumstances. He was very sympathetic over the Beechwood tragedy, and drew Isabel to speak more of it to him than she had done to anyone else. ' I cannot tell you how awfully grieved I was"], [115, "DUNCAN MORAY. 107 when I heard what had happened,' he said. ' He was such a fine old man.' 'I did not know you knew him.' ' Yes. I met him once. It was at an agricul tural show. I sat beside him at dinner. We got into rather close conversation over a variety of topics, and he showed so much good sense, and such a high tone of feeling altogether. He was a man one felt obliged to respect. I do not in the least wonder that you felt such a strong regard for him. I was very anxious to get a high reward offered for the apprehension of the murderer. I would willingly have found the money myself. But, strangely enough, the thing fell through in consequence, chiefly, of the resolute opposition of his son.' ' I never heard of that' ' No. The matter was allowed to drop. One could not press it against Mr. Moray's strongly expressed wish.' ' What objection did he urge ? ' 'He seemed to have an almost overstrained dread of some innocent person being laid under"], [116, "DUNCAN MORAY. 108 suspicion. I suggested to him that Mr. Elliott would probably be able to identify the man, or at least to set the police on the track to identify him. But he held to it that what Mr. Elliott had himself said showed that it would be extremely unsafe to trust to his recognition, while, should he make any mistake, he would almost certainly doom the man. In fact, he showed so much repugnance to the idea, altogether, that we felt obliged to let it drop. I thought it rather strange.' ' There is something in his argument,' Isabel replied. ' I know my father was very doubtful whether he would recognise the man. It would have been very terrible had he made any mistake. He at least would be very thankful to be spared any such awful risk.' It was a mild, sunny winter afternoon, Isabel was strolling slowly up and down the terrace before the castle, with Walter and Laura Millar. Lady Sinclair, who had just superintended the departure of a tribe of visitors, had seated herself on a seat, in a sheltered corner, and there Laura Millar almost immediately joined her."], [117, "DUNCAN MORAY. 109 ' What are those two discussing with such ab sorbing interest ? ' Lady Sinclair asked. 'The stock subject, old Mr. Moray's murder. They have a common interest in it' ' No. Have they ? ' asked Lady Sinclair, with sudden animation. ' Yes. Walter had met him somewhere, and was immensely taken with him. He quite shares Miss Elliott's admiration for the old man. I think Miss Elliott speaks more on the subject to him than to any one else. But have you heard the strange stories that are flying about on the sub ject, Lady Sinclair?' 'No.' ' Mrs. Fordyce lunched at Southend the day we came here, and she was telling us all about it. She is a dreadful little gossip, you know. It seems \u2014 perhaps you know \u2014 I did not, but mother had heard something of it \u2014 that the late Mr. Elliott had a family iu Edinburgh. The story going about now is that his eldest sou is the murderer ; that he attacked Mr. Moray, mistaking him for Mr. Elliott ; and that Mr. Elliott concealed"], [118, "DUNCAN MORAY. 110 him about the house afterwards, and helped him to escape as soon as the search had a little re laxed.' ' How very disinterested of him,' Lady Sinclair replied, laughing. ' Oh, they are all ready with reasons. They say there is no doubt there was a marriage, and that he really is the rightful possessor of the pro perty, and that Mr. Elliott knows it, and that that is the reason he was so anxious to save him. Of course, Mr. Elliott has him completely in his power now, and he dare not cross him ; whereas, if he had been hung for the murder, there would have been nothing to prevent the next brother from taking up the case, aud claiming the pro perty. They are beginning to say that it was in reality over this marriage that Mr. Elliott and the old laird were at enmity ; and that Mr. Elliott has all along known all about it, and that the question would crop up whenever he succeeded.' 'Most ingenious, certainly. But still there is the little difficulty of old Mr. Moray having recog nised and named the man who attacked him.'"], [119, "DUNCAN MORAY. 111 ' That is the strangest part of the story. The theory is that the Morays had paid such court to Miss Elliott because they saw she is almost roman- tically generous, and they thought they would be able, one day, to get the land from her ; and that old Mr. Moray knew there was some chance this marriage might be proved, aud was just as anxious as anyone else Mr. Elliott's claim to the property should not be disputed. They say he was sensible for longer than was known, and put his son up to this story, having chanced to know that the Carfraes and Elliotts had been connected, just to turn off suspicion, aud that that accounts for Mr. Moray's strange disinclination that any active steps should be taken to trace the murderer. And you know, Lady Sinclair,' she added, in a lower tone, ' it is rather odd ; but the Procurator-Fiscal did tell my father that Mr. Elliott seemed much startled and agitated when he told him that Mr. Moray had named this Carfrae as his murderer.' ' My dear Miss Millar, the latter part of the story is a moral impossibility, because it all hinges on perhaps the two most honourable and upright men"], [120, "DUNCAN MORAY. 112 in the county being capable of most detestable meanness. For the rest, take my advice, and do not say a word about it to anyone. It can do no good, and such idle chatter often results in much pain and sorrow to the innocent. Now I am going in. I feel it chilly.' She rose as she spoke, and Miss Millar rejoined her brother and Isabel. Lady Sinclair looked very grave and thoughtful as she walked towards the house, and her exhortations to her informant to keep silence, did not prevent her at once repeat ing, herself, the whole story to Sir Robert. ' A queer story,' was his brief comment. 'Ay, Robert, and fits the circumstances to a nicety, save only the theory of the Morays' motives. But then that is not a part of the story it is difficult to fill up more credibly. Think what it would be to that honourable high-spirited girl if such doings on her father's part came to light. Duncan Moray loves her, there is no question of that, and 1 believe the old man's affection for her was something quite remarkable. They would be quite capable of trying to hush up the matter out of regard for her."], [121, "DUNCAN MORAY. 113 Oh, Robert, that poor girl is lying on the top of a volcano ! ' she added, with almost a sob. ' Not a worse one than exploded under poor Amy, when she ran away with Lowther, my dear. You saved her then. I daresay you would manage to save Miss Elliott now. But you must not allow plausible hypotheses to run away with you, Bertha. The most doubtful thing here is that the story fits so well. The truth rarely does fit the appearance so accurately, when you don't know everything. I say more emphatically than ever \u2014 get her married. How does your scheme go on ? ' ' Excellently. They have found a common interest in old Mr. Moray, for whom it seems young Millar had a very great regard. Give two young people a common subject of interest, and plenty of time to discuss it, and the rest will follow. I thought until to-day the thing was possible ; now I regard it as probable. When I begin to see their cordial friendliness of demeanor changing to reserve and constraint, I shall feel that the probability is approaching certainty.\" \u20222 11"], [122, "DUNCAN MORAY. 114 CHAPTER VI. VERY NEAR THE BREAKING POINT. sPHE visit of the Millars could not, however, be indefinitely prolonged; and when, after a sojourn of nearly a fortnight, they departed, the cordial friendliness of Isabel Elliott's manner to Walter Millar was still wholly unclouded. ' I do not believe the idea has dawned upon her yet,' Lady Sinclair said to her husband, ' and I am rather glad it is so, for it cannot be denied that he is very commonplace. She is appallingly critical when she chooses. If the thought came to her now, she might begin to vivisect him. If she gets more used to him, without any such incentive to critical analysis, she will be less likely to detect his deficiencies so readily.' ' Love does not seem to go for much in your calculations, Bertha.' A slight cloud passed across Lady Sinclair's"], [123, "DUNCAN MORA Y. 115 face, but on that subject she was not disposed to speak out all her mind to her husband. ' Indeed you are mistaken,' she said. ' That is the very reason I do nothing more than give them the chance of finding out if they do love one auother. I would never advise any girl to marry a man un less she loved him. But women of a very high class not only, as you said, get on very well, but do often really love men who are greatly their inferiors. I suspect poor Isabel's path in life has lain far more in the cold shadow of neutrality, than in the warm sunshine of love. She would be likely to be less exacting than more richly en dowed favourites of fortuue, and might, I think, come to love an honest kind-hearted fellow like Walter Millar well enough.' Lady Sinclair's penetration, however, failed her a little, or it might perhaps rather be that the quiet self-controlled manner which Isabel Elliott could so well maintain when it suited her to do so, baffled her. The girl was by no means blind to the probability that she might some day have it in her power to decide whether Southend should be"], [124, "116 DUNCAN MORAY. her home. The perception had come slowly to her, during the last week of the Millars' stay, and had cost her many hours of grave, half sad reflec tion. A few months earlier she would have dis missed the idea promptly, as one not requiring a single moment's consideration ; but at that time she had not basked in the sunny moral atmosphere of Craignellan, and the fatherly tenderness of Adam Moray, with life at Beechwood, and the constant companionship of her father, set over against it. She was not herself aware what a revolution in all her sentiments these two ex- periences had wrought, quickening her sensibility to both joy and sorrow, but rendering the calm patience with which she had faced her monotonous life in London no longer a possibility. The first two months of her life at Beechwood had been a sort of blissful dream. The last month had brought her to the point of sometimes revolving in her secret musings the possibility of a favourable consideration of Walter Millar's suit. It was a vague and pointless kind of revolving, for she did not at all regard the contingency as imminent In"], [125, "DUNCAN MORAY. 117 fact, she held her admirer to be only so lightly fettered, that it was by no means impossible some more attractive rival might yet intervene. But did he continue in his present frame of mind, what should her decision be ? She never reached any answer to that question. Such a strange yearning sadness would come creeping over her whenever she had listlessly mused over it for a little while, that she would resolutely put it away, resolving to enjoy the present moment, and leave the future to develop itself. She was very happy. She was in fact enjoying all the pleasures, without any of the pains of society, all the amusements, without any of the responsibility. Visitors came and went There had been a ball at Heathfield, and sundry large dinner parties, besides other gaieties. She had made the acquaintance of various county magnates, beyond the range of Beechwood, and had been taken to the Duke's, and received by the Duchess in a way which quite guaranteed the position of au Elliott of Beechwood, being thus accorded, in the most decisive manner possible,"], [126, "DUNCAN MORAY. 118 the freedom of the county. But Lady Sinclair's almost boisterous energy of management prevented her from ever requiring any aid from her guest in the task of entertaining, so Isabel had no penance of occasional boredom to go through. She had a pretty little private sitting-room adjoining her bed-room, and was perfectly free to spend her time there alone if she pleased. Thus some two months had slipped away. Mr. Elliott gave no hint of any intention of returning to Beechwood, and a suggestion from Isabel that it was time she should think of going home, had been promptly crushed. ' Why in the world do you want to go and mope alone in that gloomy solitude through these dull short winter days? Your nerves will give way ; you will begin to see ghosts ; and end up in the county asylum.' ' I have no particular wish to return there,' she answered, not without a half sigh. ' But 1 think I have quartered myself quite long enough upon you.' ' My dear Isabel,' Lady Sinclair replied, with"], [127, "DUNCAN MORAY. 119 less bluntness than was usual with her, ' you will find it hard to do that. Your society has made this winter a very pleasant one to me. Unless for some private reason you really wish to go home, do not think of leaving us until your father returns.

Not many days after that decisive settlement of the question of Miss Elliott's movements, as she Avas one morning writing letters in her sitting room, the door opened, aud Lady Sinclair herself entered, merely sayiug \u2014 ' I have brought you a visitor, Isabel.'

I came partly to see him.' ' Ah, then I am consoled. I must leave you to Miss Elliott now. I shall see you at luucheon, Mr. Moray.' ' Ye're very kind,' replied Duncan quietly, but firmly, ' but I promised to be back at my friend's farm for dinner.' ' Oh that was very stupid of you. Let me send over a message.' ' I cannot do that, Leddy Sinclair. I promised.' ' Then I know it is no use to expostulate. Well, Isabel, you must bring Mr. Moray to my boudoir, to say good-bye to me before he leaves.' With that she went her way, aud Isabel, with something a trifle less than her usual composure, bade her unexpected visitor welcome. ' I need not ask how ye are, Miss Elliott,' he said.

Theu, iu a year's time, we can see if I'm minded to sell, au' he to buy the place, or no. He's a kind-hearted man, an' right glad to give me a helping hand in this trouble.' Isabel had listened in silence to this explanation, though she had grown a trifle paler. She only said \u2014 ' It seems an admirable arrangement. Have you quite concluded it? '"], [132, "124 DUNCAN MORAY. ' Yes. We've been corresponding about it this some time past, an' it's settled now. I thought if I'd a mind to do it, the sooner the better.

I couldn't think to go away for so long without saying goodbye to ye, so I just took the chance to ride over an' see you an' my auld friend the same day.' ' I am very glad you came. I should have been very grieved if you had gone without my seeing you again. I am sure you are taking a very wise course. Still I shall hope the change may be only for a time.' ' That's what time only can show. I'll be in no hurry to come to a decision I cannot take back' ' Beechwood has already lost some of its charm for me,' Isabel said bitterly. 'It will not tend to diminish that process, to feel that our coming there has been the means of driving you from your home.' ' Never think o't that way, Miss Elliott.

Ye brought nothing wi' ye but a kind o' pleasure that was new to my father an' me, an' which gave a wonderful sort o' a brightness to his life. If others marred yer good work, that was no fault o' yours.' ' Quite true,' she replied, with her pitiless logic, 'still the fact remains. Had we remained in Lon don your father would in all probability have been still alive and well, and a life-long source of bitter pain would have been averted from you. That view of the matter is often before me as it is. It will not be the less so when I have to add to it that the same contingency would have saved you from being driven into exile.' ' To take it that way's no facing the future bravely,' he said, with a faint attempt at a smile. ' No. It is looking the inevitable boldly iu the face. Do you suppose, as I walk about, the house at Craignellan will not always seem to be looking down at me with reproachful eyes ? ' She ended with something like a sob. Duncan Moray turned very pale, and made a hasty motion,"], [134, "126 DUNCAN MORAY. as if to put out his hand towards her. Then checking himself, he said \u2014 ' Ye must not let such notions get a hold on ye, Miss Elliott. They soon grow into a kind o' a morbid feeling. Never think I'm for giving in altogether because I'm down for the moment. I'll aye live as an honest upright man should, an' I've no doubt thiugs will brighten for me in time. Ye'll make it harder for me to go if I leave ye so douuhearted, an' I'll wish I'd never come nigh ye, or told ye aught. Then ye'd no have known why I went away.' 'I should probably have imagined something much worse. One's imagination always does the worst for one under such circumstances.' ' Well, only remember that to think ye're no happy would add a weary weight to the trouble I'll have to fight through. For my father's sake try no to fret. There's nothing would grieve him more, could he ken it. Ye know almost his last thoughts were for you, an' the hope ye'd be happy. But before I go there's something I want ye to undertake for me.'"], [135, "DUNCAN MORAY. 127 ' I know,' she said, with tears in her eyes. ' You surely do not need to ask?' He smiled. ' I couldn't suffer to think his grave was neglected. An' when the weather is fit ye might make a wee picture for me o' the church an' churchyard, where ye can see the grave. An' now there's but one thing more. Ye'll no forget yer promise because I'm away ? ' ' What promise ? ' ' That if ye were in any trouble, an' I could help ye, ye'd come to me. It doesn't seem like as there could be anything to make ye want help, or I thiuk I'd have the courage to stay an' face every thing. But if anything should come that ye think I could give ye help ye'd rather have from me than from others, ye'll write to me, will ye no ? I've the address here for ye, an' I could always make an excuse to come to Craignellan. Because I'm no strong enough to face the fight, ye'll no take from me the chance to fulfil my father's last commands, will ye ? ' Isabel could not answer. She only held out her hand in silence. He took it, and without speaking,"], [136, "DUNCAN MORAY. 128 as he had once done before, pressed it to his lips. Then, as he laid the address on her writing book, he said \u2014 ' 1 mustn't linger now. Keep up a brave heart. We'll maybe meet in happier days yet. Now ye must take me to Leddy Sinclair.' That was a fairly long pilgrimage, and Duncan Moray was not devoid of tactical skill. He paused to admire a fine prospect from a window here, to ask about a picture there, as they passed along the broad corridors; so that by the time they reached Lady Sinclair's boudoir, not even the sharp eyes of that astute dame could detect any trace of agitation on the face of either. She received Duncan Moray very cordially, and rose several points in Isabel's estimation. Her manner softened almost to winning courtesy. There was nothing in it of the blunt brusqueness which in her own social circle was merely Lady Sinclair's way, but which, with Duncan Moray, might have seemed a half insolent assumption of superiority. She discussed his plans, duriug the brief time he stayed, with friendly interest ; ap-"], [137, "DUNCAN MORAY. 129 plauded the wisdom of his decision, and spoke of the future with a cheering confidence which had evidently a brightening influence upon him. Then they walked down to the Castle terrace together, and Lady Sinclair sent him off with the nearest approach to a hearty laugh which Isabel had heard from him since the death \u00a7of his father, by telling him his horse was an unmitigated brute, and that he looked so well on horseback he deserved a better mount. A faint sensation of something approaching resentment stirred in Miss Elliott's breast as she stood looking on. ' How admirably you treated him,' she said. ' You quite brightened him up. I felt so stupid, quite tongue-tied. He seemed so terribly down cast when talking to me, and I could not think of a single cheering word to say which did not seem as if I was urging him not to grieve about his father's death.' ' My dear, you are in a measure fellow sufferers, and therefore your sympathetic feelings mutually excite, rather than soothe your grief. A cheering sympathy can only come from one who is practi- 2 i"], [138, "130 DUNCAN MORAY. cally unconcerned. It is a good thing for both of you that he is going away. It will greatly tend to prevent there being anything to remind either of you of so dismal a tragedy.' It chanced, however, that Lady Siuclair and Isabel were alone that day. They were in the midst of an interregnum of visitors, and Sir Robert had not appeared. After dinner they be took themselves to Lady Sinclair's boudoir, and there she again brought up the subject of Duncan Moray. ' The blow has told upon him most terribly, she said. ' I think I never saw a strong man, in the prime of life, so completely knocked down by any thing.' ' But did you ever know such a horrible thing happen to anyone in such a horrible way ? ' Lady Sinclair dropped her hands, which were trifliug with some knitting, in her lap, and lying back in her easy chair gazed thoughtfully into the fire. After a few moments' pause, she said \u2014 ' To tell you the truth, I am a little misty about what actually did happen, at least, beyond the"], [139, "DUNCAN MORAY. 131 bare facts. The accounts we heard were so con fused, some of them so contradictory ; and I never liked to question you at all closely about it' ' I do not in the least mind telling you exactly what happened, if you care to hear. Of course I have got over the first dreadful shock, when I could not bear to speak about it ; and you will not make exasperating comments or draw obvious morals. I really believe Mrs. Alison regards the whole thing as providentially designed to prove how entirely she has always been in the right iu affirming that the road up to Beechwood ought to be strongly fenced.' Lady Sinclair laughed. ' I can fancy it striking her in that light If it really does not distress you, my dear, I should very much like to hear an accurate account of the whole circumstances.' Isabel Elliott, being clear-headed, was a good narrator, and she told the whole story distinctly, from the time of sending the note to ask Mr. Moray to come to Craiguellan. Lady Sinclair listened with keen attention. 'It is most mysterious,' she said."], [140, "132 DUNCAN MORAY. ' I really do believe my father must be right,' Isabel said, ' that he was himself the intended victim. Mr. Gillespie told me that he had asked Mr. Duncan Moray whether he thought his father had meutioned to anyone his intention of going to Beechwood that evening, aud he said he believed no one knew it but himself. It is impossible the man could have known of the arrangement' ' It seems so, certainly,' Lady Sinclair replied, ' Certainly neither my father nor I had men tioued it' ' Did not your servants know ? ' ' Not till about half an hour before the time Mr. Moray was expected. When Marion took the lamps into the library, my father told her he ex pected Mr. Moray, and she was to take him straight to the library when he came. She never said anything. You know we had hardly any servants then. She did not tell the girl, and Peter was busy in the stable. There is one thing,' she added, thoughtfully, ' which has always been rather a puzzle to me.' ' What ? '"], [141, "DUNCAN MORAY. 133 ' Well, something had happened between the Tuesday when my father sent his note, aud the Friday which had quite changed all Mr. Moray's iutentious about the land.' ' Really ? ' said Lady Sinclair, in a rather startled tone. ' How do you know that? ' ' When I met him that afternoon he told me that when he received my father's letter he had not come to any decision what he would do. But that he had, since then, quite resolved that he would not hear of the question being re-opened.' ' But that proves nothing beyond the fact that he had made up his mind upon a question he had uot previously decided.' ' He was not a man to act in that hesitating sort of way. If he had been undecided, after receiving the note, he would have remained so until after he had heard what my father wished to say to him, unless, meantime, something had happened which had made him take his resolution. Aud that is what I feel quite certaiu was the case.' ' Does his son know anything of this? ' ' I have never mentioned the subject, but I think"], [142, "134 DUNCAN MORAY. he must. My father wished, afterwards, to make over the laud to him absolutely, without any further discussion. He refused, quite abruptly, to have anything to do with it on any terms. There is some mystery about that part of the transaction, I feel certain, and sometimes I think that mystery must be the key to the whole disaster. But we shall never know now.' ' Can that mystery be in any way connected with the other mystery of Duncan Moray's strange apparent apathy about the murderer being brought to justice?' asked Lady Sinclair, furtively watching her as she spoke. ' I don't know. He is not really apathetic. You must not do him that injustice. He told me he would give his right hand to bring him to justice ; aud that the heaviest part of his burden was the feeling that it was hopeless to think it could ever be done.' Lady Sinclair almost gasped. 'Could it be possible that for once scandal had chanced to light upon the truth ? The story which had seemed to fit so well when she first heard it, fitted even"], [143, "DUNCAN MORAY. 135 better, now she knew more of the undoubted facts of the case. It only needed to foist into the trans action the hypothesis of some unsuspected com munication which had convinced Adam Moray of the probability the reputed claimant had some ground for holding himself the rightful heir, and his action regarding the land was fully explained. If Mr. Elliott had, for his own interests, made him self accessory after the fact by concealing the murderer, his apparently mysterious escape was easy to explain; and if the faintest suspicion of the possibility of such a transaction had crossed the Morays' thoughts, Duncan's subsequent conduct was satisfactorily accounted for. Not even to bring his father's murderer to justice, would he be in the least likely to run the most remote risk of drawing down such an avalanche as that upon Isabel Elliott's head. \u2022 It seems to me,' Sir Robert said, when she told him the substance of Isabel's communications, ' that Miss Elliott's story suggests an even more probable hypothesis.' ' How so ? '"], [144, "DUNCAN MORAY. 136 ' If there was really any question of a marriage \u2014 and I do remember some scandals flying about, when I was young, about Beechwood and some woman \u2014 it is not improbable this man Carfrae may have known something of it, having been a retainer in the family. In which case I think it is far from improbable he may have communicated with Mr. Moray, hoping to induce him to condone his past sins through holding out a chance of a weapon which would enable him to make his own terms with Mr. Elliott about the land. And that disappointed in that hope, he resolved on the murder as his only means of clearing the way for making use of his knowledge with Mr. Elliott him self. In that case, of course he was foiled by the old man living long enough to make a deposition. It is a strange business anyway. But for Miss Elliott's sake I most devoutly hope it may be one which will remain a mystery for all time.'"], [145, "DUNCAN MORAY. 137 CHAPTER VII. WALTER MILLAR'S ZENITH AND NADIR. A BEAUTIFUL sunny afternoon, early in May, found Isabel Elliott seated beside Lady Sinclair on the Castle terrace at Heathfield, in a rather sombre mental condition. Mr. Elliott was on his way home, and she was to return to Beech wood the following day, to prepare for his almost immediate arrival. She had been very happy at Heathfield, and had come to feel somethiug more than mere friendly regard for Lady Sinclair. But for the catastrophe at Beechwood she might pro bably have continued for loug to regard her with somewhat mingled feelings. But that untoward event had brought her face to face with the true woman, existing behind those less attractive aspects, respecting which longer acquaintance had only confirmed her first suspicions, that they were of the nature of defensive armour \u2014 the weapons employed against a society which Lady Sinclair"], [146, "138 DUNCAN MORAY. knew courted her for its own ends, while it held her in covert disdain. Aud now Isabel Elliott was contemplating, at the very least without any enthusiasm, her im pending return to the place which less than a year since had seemed a perfect Elysium ; aud if Walter Millar \u2014 whose visits to Heathfield had been pretty frequent during the winter\u2014 and Southend, were not absolutely in her thoughts in that connection, they certainly lay very close be hind them. The thought of Beechwood, with her father's society superadded, it may be safely said, did not exercise a prejudicial influence on young Millar's chances. Suddenly Lady Sinclair broke a short silence. ' I shall miss you horribly, Isabel. I have no personal grudge against your father, but I do wish he had fallen a victim to the charms of some richly dowered southern beauty, and settled him self for good in some Italian palace. Then you might have remained here.' Isabel laughed, but sighed at the same time. 'I have been here six months,' she said."], [147, "DUNCAN MORAY. 139 ' It does not seem like six weeks.' Then in a jesting tone, which had nevertheless an under current of serious purpose, she added \u2014 'If I could get your father satisfactorily married, would you come aud live with me ? ' Isabel shook her head. ' If I could reach the moon, should I find it possible to breathe there ? Your suggestion is both kind and flattering, Lady Sinclair, but too far out of the range of possibilities for me to get a firm grasp of it' ' Why. Your father is a fine looking man. Why should he not marry again ? ' ' If you make any attempts to bring about such a contingency, I think you will soon discover where the difficulty lies. You see my father enjoys some of the advantages of both matrimony and bachelorhood. He has a home, and a natural pro tector, and is, at the same time, free to roam about as he pleases.' ' But he must be aware that that is a state of things, on the continuance of which he cannot build.' ' How so ? '"], [148, "140 DUNCAN MORAY. ' He can hardly suppose that he is never to be called upon to resign his natural protector. I think he might then find Beechwood both a dull and a dangerous abode.' ' I do not think he troubles himself much about any such perils. He told me lately, with remark able candour, I was not very likely to attract the sort of men to be met with in society. I daresay he thinks he is quite certain of my company for the term of his natural life.' ' My dear Isabel,' Lady Sinclair said, ' if you are really sheltering yourself behind that delusion, it is quite time you were hunted out of it. You must be very blind, my dear, if you do not see that sooner or later, you will have to decide whether or not you intend to remove yourself from Beechwood to Southend?' ' 1 certainly am not blind,' was the quiet reply, and Lady Sinclair noted a ring of pathos in the tone, and a wistful pleading look which came into the girl's eyes. ' Then is it permitted to a friend to ask what you intend ? Remember, Isabel, that I am not"], [149, "DUNCAN MORAY. 141 asking under any commission to sound you as to your sentiments. I know that Walter Millar admires you very much, and I know that his family would give you a hearty welcome ; and, knowing that, I made him free of the house, leav ing him to make use of his opportunities as he chose. It is for you to determine whether the advantages he has to offer, counterbalance the disadvantages. I do not even know if he is aware that I suspect what he intends.' Isabel was silent for a moment. Then she said \u2014 ' It is certainly permitted to ask, but I fear it is not possible to answer ; for I simply do not know myself what I intend.' ' For a resolute young person like yourself that is surely a strange state of indecision ? ' ' Perhaps. But then, you know, all the con ditions of my life have undergone such strange changes within the last year, that it is a little bewildering.' ' Do you care for him ? ' I like him very much. There is something loveable enough about him to make me think one"], [150, "DUNCAN MORAY. 142 might become much attached to him. But then, on the other hand, I have a lurking dread that one might possibly grow very tired of him. In fact, to tell the truth, I believe I am rather in a condition of neutrality, drifting along in hope circumstances may give a decided turn one way or another.' Lady Sinclair turned towards her with an anxious expression on her face. ' What do you mean by circumstances ? ' she asked. ' Anything which may give a decided bent to my present neutral condition.' ' My dear Isabel, whatever you do, be sure you do not allow any \" bent \" as you term it, save the certainty that you love him, to induce you to marry any man. Do not make my mistake.' ' Yours ? ' ' Yes. Sir Robert and I have been for long, now, such excellent friends, that I have no hesita tion in admitting that I married him without loving him. It was a strange affair.

He is nearly twenty years older than I am, and he was always very kind to me. They were a bad lot about my father's house, and a regular plot was laid to induce him to back heavily, for a steeple chase, a horse of my father's, whose jumping powers were quite phenomenal, but so also was his temper. Sir Robert did not know that though he would jump freely enough in cold blood, when he got excited in the field, uo one save myself could do anything with him. I found out, quite at the last moment, what was going on, and I knew Sir Robert was hard up, and that to lose would be ruin to him. I was awfully angry, it was such a rascally proceeding, and I determined I would pull him through. I was a slim girl of seventeen, and I dressed myself up as a jockey and rode myself. It wasn't Sir Robert who was ruined, but there was a tremendous uproar. The horse had never shown himself in such splendid form, and it was all over the place, at once, that the rider must be either Bertha Ashton, or the devil. I was engaged then to a young fellow I really did love, but his family were"], [152, "DUNCAN MORAY. 144 all against us. They made the most of the scandal and the engagement was broken off. Perhaps it was as well. I think he can hardly have cared very much for me, or he would have stood by me. Sir Robert was terribly cut up about it, and he entreated me to marry him, as the best way of putting the matter right. 1 was reck less, and I agreed. But there was no real love between us, and for years we were not very happy. Indeed it would, I believe, have been utter shipwreck, only that we mutually felt we owed a debt to the other, and we could not forget that, if we could forget we were husband and wife. But I know full well what a marriage without love is, to a young woman ; and I do most emphatically say, Isabel, never marry any man unless you are certain you love him.' ' Then you most certainly say to me, do not marry Walter Millar.' ' At present, yes. But wait and see. I honestly believe him to be a man with whom any woman if she really loved him, might be very happy.'"], [153, "DUNCAN MORAY. 145 ' He once told me he was not strong, in character I mean, not in health.' ' That, my dear,' said Lady Sinclair, laughing through the unwonted gravity of her mood, ' is, as far as other people are concerned, a strong reason for your marrying him. You have quite strength enough for both, and when two very strong people get together, they are apt to ride it terribly rough shod over everyone sometimes. But, my dear girl, I beseech you let no thought of marriage, merely as an escape from a life which is distasteful to you, cross your thoughts. For you there is no such wretched alternative. Where ever I am there will always be a home for you. Do not let anything tempt you to marry any man with the least shadow of feeling in the background that you would not have done so had you been differently situated. I do not think Walter Millar is likely to press you closely just at present. Leave the matter in abeyance, and decide when the time comes, solely on the one consideration.' Sir Robert indulged in a hearty fit of laughter"], [154, "146 DUNCAN MORAY. when he heard such parts of this conversation as his wife thought fit to retail to him. 'Well done, Bertha!' he exclaimed. You have reversed the orthodox order of proceeding. You went out to bless, and you have remained to curse. This is all you can do for that poor young man, after encouraging him to the utmost of your ability to singe his wings. It is a most abominable shame. Just like the heartlessness of women. Well, it is clearly no use for you to play at match making. You have broken down hopelessly.' 'My encouragement to him to singe his wings,' she replied gravely, ' was before Duncan Moray came here. Had Southend been a few hundred miles away, I might have been more eloquent in his favour. But I would not encourage her to marry a man, with no strong feeling of love for him, when that marriage would settle her for good within a few miles of Craignellan.' 'Oh, ho ! Is the case so serious as that ? ' ' I do not know that there is any case at all, on her side. But I have seen what is the influence of a love which is half worship on a very fine type of"], [155, "DUNCAN MORAY. 147 masculine humanity. I am not going to run any risks.' It was, thus, in far from an exultant mood, that Isabel Elliott returned to Beechwood, and began the task of disinterring and re-arranging the household gods. But she made the house look very bright, and did her best to put on a corres ponding appearance when she welcomed her father home. He greeted her very affectionately. ' The sight of you removes my last lingering qualm of conscience,' he said, laughing. 'Why?' ' Because you have improved so amazingly in appearance that I am sure you must have passed the winter very pleasantly. I have been occasion ally troubled by prickings of conscience when I was enjoying myself, as to whether you might not be finding it very dull at Heathfield.' ' Dull ; in Lady Sinclair's house ? ' 'Well, I suppuse that is not a very probable occurrence. I suspect neither of us would have felt quite so lively to-day, Isabel, had we passed"], [156, "148 DUNCAN MORAY. the winter alone in this sweetly sequestered Arcadia of ours.' ' You have certainly gained much from the change,' she replied. ' You look a good many years younger than you did when you left' ' Yes. I feel very much like my old self. The few weeks I spent here seem like some horrible nightmare. I mean to try and wipe them wholly out of my memory, and consider that I am now appearing in the character of the laird of Beech wood for the first time. If you take my advice, you will try and adopt a similar resolution.' She only answered with a faint smile. Never had she felt more painfully conscious, than at that moment, how wide was the gulf which yawned between her and her father. There had been a certain constraint in their very meeting, of which she bad never before been conscious. And now, the best advice he had to give her was that she should root up from her memory the brightest period of her whole life, a brief span of perfect enjoyment, which seemed to be only intensified by the tragic gloom in which it had disappeared."], [157, "DUNCAN MORAY. 149 There seemed to be nothing for her to do save to fall back as much as possible into their old London life of independence, aud to fill up her time with the more congenial occupations of a country life. ' I never see Mr. Moray about anywhere,' her father said to her one day, shortly after his return to Beechwood. ' Does he shut himself up entirely at Craignellan ? ' ' He has left Craignellan. Did you not know that ? ' ' Left Craignellan ! ' exclaimed Mr. Elliott, with sudden animation. ' No. How should I ? You never told me ? ' ' I thought Mr. Gillespie might have done so.' ' I never heard of it. You do not mean that he is gone for good ? ' Isabel explained the arrangement, her father listening with the keenest interest ' Pray Heaven he may make up his miud to sell,' he said. ' I feel almost inclined to say that if he were clear away from the neighbourhood, for good, I should have nothing left to wish for.'"], [158, "150 DUNCAN MORA Y. Isabel made no answer, only her lips tightened in a way which gave a set hard look to her face. ' It seems an inhuman sort of thing to say,' Mr. Elliott continued, after a moment's silence, ' but I cannot help the feeling. If the family were completely removed, so that there might be nothing any longer to call to mind the whole wretched story of their connection with this property, it would be a sort of new life to me. If he does make up his mind to sell, I wonder if he will have the grace to give me the refusal of the place. I would make a great effort to buy it back for your sake.' ' I rather imagine, if he does so,' Isabel replied, with a stony manner, ' it will be a friendly arrangement with his cousin.' ' What is this cousin's name ? ' Campbell.' Have you any notion what sort of a man he is?' ' Mr. Gillespie told me he seems a shrewd, intelligent, well-informed man. I have not seen him.'"], [159, "DUNCAN MORAY. 151 Mr. Elliott made no further remark, but his daughter could not fail to observe, subsequently to the receipt of that information about Duncan Moray, a certain brisk alertness about him, which she had never seen in him since the day when the news reached him, in London, that he had become possessor of Beechwood. He threw himself with ardour into the work of improving the place, aud of getting together the long deferred establish ment, which would, he said, enable them to live like social beings, instead of like hermits. Aud he almost startled her sometimes with the prospects he seemed to be forming for the future. Certainly his fears that she might find herself heavily taxed, through inability on his part to find occupation and amusement for himself in the country, were turning out, for the moment, exceedingly ground less. It was she, who as time passed on, felt often dull, and even depressed, and almost inclined to think that her father's activity was suggestive of a sort of feverish restlessness. For dull and depressed she certainly did often feel, and she was a little disposed to find the"], [160, "152 DUNCAN MORAY. reason in pure contradictiousuess. She had been as happy as the day was long, spending nearly all her time alone, with only Marion and a little kitchen maid to attend to her, and all excursions bounded by her walking powers ; and now she felt often sad and listless, with an establishment sufficient for all their requirements, and a carriage always at her command, so that an enlivening interchange of hospitalities with the neighbouring country houses was constantly kept up. Certainly her life would have seemed to an onlooker sufficiently enjoyable for a girl who had no taste for living in a whirl of dissipation. Mrs. Grierson was cordial as ever, and a good deal less didactic, although she often impressed on Miss Elliott that she had been fortunate beyond her deserts in getting thus established in the county, after her obstinate defiance of local traditions. ' Well, you see,' Isabel one day told her, ' it is just a proof that if one means to sin, one should sin boldly. Half-hearted measures never answer. Had I sinned in a tentative hesitating sort of"], [161, "DUNCAN MORAY. 153 way, I should have been kicked out of Asgard, and regarded with suspicion in Midgard. Now I have made good my footing in both, and can roam from one to the other at my own sweet will. Lay the lesson to heart, Mrs. Grierson, and never sin by halves.' Mrs. Grierson changed the subject. She did not quite like Miss Elliott in that particular mood, failing frequently to understand her allusions, and gathering only a general idea that she had a strain of her father's cynicism about her. Mrs. Fordyce affirmed, with high delight, that she really did not know whether Walter aud Laura Millar lived most at Southend or at Beech wood. The assertion savoured of hyperbole, still, without any doubt, the interchange of visits was frequent ; and Lady Sinclair keenly watching what went on, was inclined to think that Walter Millar's chances were improving. Yet now she could not but admit that the chance of that occurring which she had herself tried at least to bring within the range of possibility, filled her more with anxiety than with satisfaction ; and"], [162, "DUNCAN MORAY. 154 Mrs. Millar, in a moment of confidence, contrived to deepen that anxiety. ' I think things look favourable for Walter's hopes,' she said. ' Miss Elliott makes no sign, but that I should not expect from her. She is naturally so reserved and self-possessed. Still, I am sure she is no coquette, and I think she must see what he means. She always receives him most cordially at Beechwood.' ' Oh, you mustn't build too much on that,' Lady Sinclair replied. ' You know, in that respect, her position is a little difficult, being mistress of her father's house. And the Elliotts were always given to hospitality.' ' There is something in that. But, do you know, I doubt if Miss Elliott is very happy. She seems to me to have grown graver and quieter of late. I could quite fancy that her father is not the pleasantest of men to live with.

It makes me feel a little anxious. I should not like to think Miss Elliott accepted Walter only because she was unhappy, and wanted to get away from Beechwood.' ' I think she will not do that. I am sure you need have no fear. She and Mr. Elliott were here for a couple of days last week. She seemed to me much as usual. And I thiuk you are quite wrong about Mr. Elliott, He is certainly not pre possessing, but he and Isabel are excellent friends. I have often heard her contrast her own position favourably with that of other girls similarly situated. There is nothing small about him. He would never be a petty tyrant' ' Well, we shall see. How long are you to remain abroad ? ' ' Till towards the end of September I think.'

' I really must say Miss Elliott makes herself rather ridiculous, taking a sketch of old Mr. Moray's grave, indeed ; to hang up in her room I suppose, and sentimentalize over. I should have given her credit for penetration enough to see through their self-interested attentions. But flattery is an offering some people cannot possibly resist' Isabel's prediction to Duncan Moray had not been falsified. The white house at Craignellan seemed to look down at her with mournful eyes, across the peaceful valley, mutely protesting against the baleful influence which had crept over from the sombre pine woods and stem granite boulders of Beechwood, to rob it of all the moral warmth and sunshine which had harmonized so well with its material conditions ; aud more than once a wish had stolen over her that she could go"], [165, "DUNCAN MORAY. 157 there again, and perhaps thus succeed in breaking the spell, by associating strangers with the scene of so many sad reminiscences. But she did not know the Campbells, and had no excuse for introducing herself; independently of a feeling that an Elliott was hardly likely to be a specially desired visitor by a relation of the Morays. But one afternoon, when she was putting the finishing touches to her little sketch, she saw Mr. Campbell, whom she knew well enough by sight, draw up his gig at the gate of the field in which she was at work, and after fastening his horse to the fence, come straight towards her. A slight air of embarrassment which was perceptible in him, as he drew near, prompted her frank genial courtesy to take the initiative. ' Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell,' she said, with a bright smile.' Are you come to look at my little sketch?' ' I'll be prood if ye'll let me see it, mem,' he replied. ' But I wad ua hae made sae free as to come an' ask ye to show it to me.'"], [166, "158 DUNCAN MORAY. ' It is just finished,' she said, holding it up for his inspection.' ' Weel, mem,' he said, 'it's nae for me to pretend to understand sic things; but it's a bonny wee picture. An' I hope ye'll no tak' it amiss if I venture to say that I think if ye wad let Duncan hae a copy it wad be the greatest pleasure ye could gie him.' ' This is for Mr. Moray. He asked me before he left to do one for him. You know it was through making a sketch I first learned to know his father.' ' Ay, sae he tauld me. It was about Duncan I made sae bauld as to come an' speak to ye, mem. My wife's had a lang letter frae him. Duncan doesna like letter writing, ye ken, an' we do not hear aften. But he tells a heap o' news about himsel' and the place, an' there are messages to you ; and my wife thocht she wad like ye to see the letter, if perhaps, some day when ye're near hand, ye wad na mind just looking in.' ' I shall be very glad to do so. It is very kind of Mrs. Campbell to suggest it I will come up to-morrow afternoon. I hope Mr. Moray is well.'"], [167, "DUNCAN MORAY. 159 ' Yes, he says so ; an' that he feels sure he did wisely to gang awa frae here. But it seems to me he writes kind o' sad like. However, ye'll see the letter yersel', mem. Ye'll excuse my no stopping noo. The lane is but narrow ; I wad na like to leave the horse lang lest onything should come by. We'll be prood to see ye to-morrow.' So the following day Isabel once more took her way across the valley, aud up the path she had never trodden since the day she had been the bearer of her father's ill-received proposition to Duncan Moray. Mrs. Campbell, a pleasant, sensi ble-looking woman, received her with very deferential cordiality. ' I'm prood ye did na tak' our asking ye to come amiss, Miss Elliott. But I didna like just to send ye Duncan's letter, an' I was sure ye wad like to see it' ' I shall indeed ; and I am very much obliged to you for giving me the chance.

I canna say it reads to me as if Duncan was in extra gude spirits, but I suppose that winna come yet awhile. It was an awfu' sair crash. My husband said, when he heard it, he didn't see how Duncan wad ever get ower it. He was aye that fond o' his father. An' yet, for a' that, by what I hear he seems to hae been fair set against ony great effort to bring the man to justice. The police-officer tauld my husband mair might hae been done had he nae rather set his face against it.' ' I know some people thought that. But what ever Mr. Moray did, you may be sure he had some good reason for it. I shall like very much to read his letter more at leisure, and I will return it to you shortly.' ' Oh, dinna fash yersel' about that. I've nae need o't I just sat doun an' answered it at once. I tauld Duncan ye were weel, an' that John wad gie ye his messages the first chance.

The letter seemed to her to justify Mrs. Camp bell's penetration. Duncan Moray declared himself to be improved in both health and spirits. He slept better, and felt more able to take an interest in all that was going on around him. But there was an undercurrent of sadness very perceptible in all he wrote, and Isabel, after sitting for some time apparently lost in thought, with the open letter lying on her knee, rose with a heavy sigh, and took the envelope off the table, intending to replace the letter. As she was about to do so another half sheet of paper within the envelope caught her eye, and drawing it out she read a postscript, which had evidently either wholly escaped Mrs. Campbell's eye, or which she had in advertently omitted to remove before giving Miss Elliott the letter. ' As to the story of Miss Elliott being to marry young Mr. Millar, I don't believe a word of it. It'll 2 l"], [170, "162 DUNCAN MORAY. be some of the clash of that old chatterbox at the manse.

It was with very flushed cheeks, and a strange sort of flash in her eyes, that Miss Elliott carefully replaced both letter and postscript in the envelope and committed it to the fire."], [171, "DUNCAN MORAY. 163 CHAPTER VIII. THE MARCH OF CIVILIZATION. i T odd intervals, for some year past, Rossan had been stirred up to uneasy excitement by rumours ot a possible railway invading its peaceful retirement. Near the mouth of the Corran there stood a large fishing village, judged to be a place likely to grow into one of some importance were it placed in direct railway communication with the interior of the country and some of the larger towns there situated ; and such communication would be most easily effected by a railway down the Corran valley. Iu Rossan there had been the usual diversity of opinion on the advantages of such a scheme ; the older inhabitants looking with distrust on new fangled notions which Rossan had done well enough without through the unnum bered years of its previous existence ; the younger people chiefly fixing their attention upon coals,"], [172, "DUNCAN MORAY. 164 which, they held, would certainly be cheaper when they had not to be carted all the way from Kirk ness. Still, the project had never hitherto taken a sufficiently definite shape to allow interest therein to grow very keen. Not long, however, after Isabel Elliott's return from Heathfield these rumours began to increase both in number and in definiteness, and soon it became known that the railway was really a thing resolved upon ; the only point still undecided being the exact course it should follow from Rossan to Dalmuir, the fish ing village aforesaid. ' It'll just be the ruin o' the place,' affirmed old Mrs. Howieson, veritably the oldest inhabitant, and now approaching her century by leaps and bouuds. ' Nae gude comes o' a' this makin' o' railroads, till naebody's content to bide at hame, the half o' his time. I mind when nae mair than ae carrier's cairt passed through Rossan in the week, an' the place was a sicht better then than ever it's been since.

If a railway comes it'll just be a deal worse. Nae a pound o' butter, or a drap o' milk, but'll be awa to the big toons.' 'Hoot woman,' exclaimed Mrs. Hamilton, 'I wonder to hear ye talk ! Think ye I've nae heard my father talk o' they auld times, an' he was born a year before ye were. Mony a day hae I heard him tell hoo ye were a' like to perish wi' the cauld whiles, in the deid o' winter, because coals could na win to ye for the roads a' blocked wi' snaw.

Nae doubt the gentry an' the farmers is a,' for railways, but it's an ill day for puir folk when they come intil a place.' \u2022 It was not, however, until just about the beginning of the shooting season, when all the couutry houses were full, that events so far developed themselves as to show the exact course which it was designed the railway should follow ; and then a mighty storm arose. The railway com pany proposed to carry their line along the flat sur face of the Corran valley. Every farmer whose land would be invaded declared that his best fields would be cut up, and half their value destroyed. The quarrymen were furious, for an alteration in the high road would be required, which would considerably increase the length of their daily walk to and from work. Mrs. Grierson was almost frantic, affirming that the Rowans would be unin habitable while the work was going on, and not worth living in afterwards. Even Mr. Gillespie"], [175, "DUNCAN MORAY. 167 looked grave about some liberties proposed to be taken with the Corran, which he thought it more than probable that insulted river would avenge in unexpected and disastrous ways, during heavy floods. From further down the valley, from Glen and Southend, was heard the up-lifted voice of wrathful protest. Why could not the company carry their line along the slope of the hill? Any extra expense in excavating and embanking would be more than met by the decreased cost of land, both absolutely and indirectly, of much smaller value. Mr. Elliott laughed sardonically at the disturb ance. 'I never heard such nonsense,' he said to his daughter, one afternoon, as they were riding homewards up the valley, after a visit to Glen, where the matter had been eagerly discussed. ' I am inclined to think Gillespie is in the right. It is a very dangerous thing to meddle with these rapid streams, especially when they are subject to sud den and heavy floods. But as for all the rest, its all nonsense. It is only because the railway peo ple have chosen that particular line. If they had"], [176, "168 DUNCAN MORAY. proposed the higher route first, there would have been just as great a riot about that' ' But it does seem hard on the quarrymen,' Isabel said. ' The distance is not more than a mile and a half now, if so much, a full third of that distance added on, especially in bad weather, is a good bit \u2014 an extra six miles walking in the week. Three hundred and twelve miles in the year, father. How many extra pair of boots does that represent ? ' ' Bless me, what an arithmetician you are ! I should have needed pencil, paper, and leisure to make out that sum. It doesn't represent a single extra pair of boots. The poaching rascals will only have so much less time to spend in doing their boots infinitely more harm. Ah, here comes the Admiral. I hear he is almost foaming at the mouth. Well, Admiral, I hope you have not been to look for us ? ' ' Yes, I have, and am very glad to have met you.' ' Come back and dine,' said Mr. Elliott. ' Not to-day, thank you. We have people with"], [177, "DUNCAN MORAY. 169 us. It was about this railway I wanted to see you.' 'Naturally. Has anyone been heard of, in the whole length of the valley, who wants to see any body about anything else ? ' ' Oh, well,' replied Admiral Grierson, a trifle nettled by his bantering tone, ' it is all very well for you. You are safe enough up in that fortress of yours ; and of course you are thinking about your larches. I see you have a good many which should be cut. But it is a confounded nuisance for us.' ' I am by no means so safe as you think Gillespie has universal deluge on the brain. I believe he is building au ark already. I should be the greatest sufferer from heavy floods.' ' The company would be bound to give com pensation.' ' Of course, aud a nice piece of business that is. In any case the mere chance of flooding must depreciate the value of the land. That sort of thing is far worse than merely seeing trains pass"], [178, "DUNCAN MORAY. 170 rather close to you several times in the day. You will soon get used to that' ' Perhaps, if that was all. But the simple truth is the thing will be a nuisance to a heap of people where they want to put it, and not a bit in any one's way where we want them to put it. They'll give in, if we make disturbance enough. They are only trying it on, just to raise a row, and then get better terms through professing themselves willing to be accommodating. But the fact is, Elliott, the thiug has a political as well as merely social aspect. That is what I am looking at, quite as much as anything else.' ' Ah. How is that ? ' ' Well, I've had a hint or two that the radicals have their eye on us. I believe it is quite a safe seat, still it does not do to make too sure. We have a couple of years at least before us yet.

He must come over, and swear he will"], [179, "DUNCAN MORAY. 171 devote every moment of his time in the House to hindering the project, until they change the route. It'll be as good as an electioneering campaign to him.' ' I see. There'll be some amusement to be had out of the thing, certainly in that case.' ' Malcolm will do it well, too. He is an energetic fellow, and a capital speaker. I am going to get him to come over and meet us all at the Rowans. You and Miss Elliott must come, and we'll get the Alisons, and Millars, and one or two others, further down, who are bitten, to meet him also ; and then we'll set a regular agitation on foot' ' By all means. It will be something to pass the time.' 'You are not going to have a shooting party, then ? ' ' Not this season. My predecessor did the best he could to annihilate the stock. We did not fire a gun last season, and I shall not do more than take a quiet day or two, this season, with the keeper.'"], [180, "DUNCAN MORAY. 172 ' Very well. I'll write aud let you know what day Malcolm can come.' ' By Jove,' Mr. Elliott said, as they rode on up the valley. ' I hope Malcolm will like his position, as member for the Rowans. Much of all this we should have heard if Mrs. Grierson had not been shuddering at the outrage of occasionally seeing a railway train out of her drawing-room window. Well, there is nothing like a division of labour. You can play at philanthropy, Isabel, and air your arithmetic, and your theories about the quarry men's boots. I will swear, on any number of platforms they like, that the safety of the empire is at stake. What a pity the Siuclairs are abroad ! Could'nt they be induced to come home and die for their country, think you ? ' ' How could they interfere in a matter which does not in the very least concern them ? ' asked his daughter. \u2022 ' My dear, that is the very reason why they should interfere.

It will be immensely amusing. I anticipate no end of fun out of the whole thing. They will all be so tremendously in earnest' ' That at least will be a new phase of character in the most of them,' replied his daughter senten tiously. It shortly appeared, however, that the great railway disturbance was to be even a more im portant breaking up of the fountains of the great deep, than had been anticipated. Being in the neighbourhood of Craignellan one day, after the conversation with Admiral Grierson, Isabel dropped in to drink a cup of tea with the Camp bells, as she was in the habit of doing, occa sionally. ' I've had Mrs. Fordyce here the day, mem,' Mrs. Campbell said, in a fine taking.' 'What about?' ' This railway. It'll be a benefit to the place in the end, nae doubt. But I'm thinking it'll do a heap o' mischief first. It'll set them a' by the ears.'"], [182, "DUNCAN MORAY. 174 ' But what does it matter to Mrs. Fordyce ? ' ' Ob, it's this notion o' getting it carried along the hill,' interposed Mr. Campbell, ' that has set them a' in a ferment at the manse. She cam' an' tackled me about it in the yaird. She was ill pleased that the wife seemed sae careless about it. If they take it along the hill, onybody can see the course'll nae doubt rin close abune the birkyaird an' manse.

It'll be a sicht mair expense to take in ground the ither side, an' she's settin' some o' the sma' heritors on that tack. There's naue o' them, by what I can make oot, has ony land down in the valley, so they dinna care what's dune down there ; an' they're bent on"], [183, "DUNCAN MORAY. 175 backing the railway people up to stick to their line as they've proposed it' ' And which side do you take?' ' Oh, neither. The way I'm in here I wad na in terfere ony way. An' its nae odds to Craignellan one way or the ither. I doubt Duncan wad na care a haet which course was chosen. When there's interests on both sides o' a question its best left to those to settle that has onything at stake. I doubt teu years hence folk'll aye wonder what there was in the matter ava to mak sic a stir ower.' Mr. Elliott, his daughter found, had also heard rumours of this rival agitation. ' I met Fordyce myself,' he said, ' in Rossan, and he buttonholed me instantly. I told him he could hardly expect me to take his view of the matter, seeing that 1 believed engineers would admit that Gillespie's fear of flooding is about the most valid objection to the valley scheme that exists, and that it is one which is of more consequence to me than to any one else. He could hardly expect me to be so Quixotic as to invite that catastrophe on myself,"], [184, "176 DUNCAN MORAY. out of a philanthropic interest in his glebe and garden.' \u25a0 ' I do not suppose the poor man is his own mas ter in the business.' ' He was equal to the situation, anyway. He assured me with a sublime confidence, which could spring only from crass ignorance, that Gillespie's fears were quite unfounded ; and drew a fearful picture of what it would cost the heritors, a few years hence, to enlarge the churchyard, if the railway blocked it up on that side. I got rather tired of it, so told him that, as far as I could see, unless he took to filling the churchyard by artificial means, it would last my time, and there fore that point would only concern my successor. This so shocked him that he let me go. But, upon my word, I take the greatest delight in throwing fuel upon the flames. It is immensely amusing. I have not felt so lively since I became the happy possessor of this mouldy old dungeon.' Of this fact there could be no doubt, and his attitude towards the whole question was another of the many surprises which his doings of late had"], [185, "DUNCAN MORAY. 177 occasioned his daughter. She could see and laugh herself at the absurd exaggeration of the whole agitation, in which as a jostling assemblage of purely selfish motives, arrayed in the fine feathers of zeal for the public welfare, or of kindly sympathy in the risk of injury to other peo ple's property, paraded themselves as very fine birds indeed. But she could not understand her father's readiness to throw himself into any such movement. It was at any time unlike him to take an active share in any such discussions, and not only did his cynical remarks show that he regarded the whole thing as overdone and absurd, but in his private conversations -with his daughter he had admitted that he believed the danger of flooding was one which it would need no great engineering skill to overcome. It seemed, there fore, as if with no possible personal interest at stake, he was voluntarily taking a prominent part in a movement he held to be ridiculous. It some times seemed to Isabel as if a restless desire for occupation of any kind had more to do with his action than anything else. It was certainly diffi- 2 M"], [186, "DUNCAN MORAY. 178 cult for her to recognize in him now the coldly, imperturbable father she had often known vainly urged in London to take the least active part in any local or public question. The projected dinner party at the Rowans took place about a week later, and there was some desultory discussion of the question during dinner. But after the men were left alone in the dining room the course of events began to make itself apparent. ' It is quite clear,' said Colonel Malcolm, ' that you must have a meeting in Rossan. Get one up any day next week you like, aud I'll attend. I'm primed up to the muzzle. A regular radical scheme ; the party of progress taking credit them selves for pressing on all works of public utility, and showing themselves totally indifferent to the rights aud interests of individuals, in so doing. As if the general public was a sort of abstraction, apart from the individuals which compose it \u2014 all that sort of thing you know. And then the conservatives, so much more cautious, moviug slowly in order to effect changes with as little evil"], [187, "DUNCAN MORAY. 179 result to individuals as possible. It will really make a very telling speech. Miss Elliott's contri bution of the quarrymen's boots is admirable. Conservatives really the working man's friends, thoughtful not only for the landed and farming interest, but taking the rights of the humblest labourer into careful consideration.' There was a general laugh. 'It'll do admirably.' Mr. ElUott said : ' We must get up a meeting at once.' ' You must take the chair, Elliott,' said Admiral Grierson. ' That I most certainly will not do.' ' Why not? You are the most fitting chairman.' 'Possibly, under different circumstances. But you must remember that, practically, 1 have been here little over three months. I do not know enough of the people or the place. At a meeting like this you should always have a chairman who has plenty of local knowledge.' ' That is quite true,' remarked Col. Malcolm. ' I would venture to suggest that you take the"], [188, "180 DUNCAN MORAY. chair yourself, Admiral. Mr. Elliott can make a speech.' ' Yes, I'll do that I'll constitute myself the re presentative of the quarrymen, and air my daughter's theories. It will be good for my pheasants, if it does no other good. We'll work up the meeting directly.' In the drawing-room, meanwhile, Mrs. Grierson had been excitedly declaiming on the same sub ject. They could never live at The Rowans while the railway was being made ; that, she supposed, would be hardly possible, even if it followed the higher line, it would bring too many bad char acters about the neighbourhood. But if it came so close past the house as the other course pro posed, the place would never be habitable again. Mrs. Alison, Mrs. Millar, and others, were also quite ready to take up their parable, and wearied at last of the whole subject, Isabel Elliott quietly left her seat, and passed out of the open window, into the soft semi-darkness of the warm summer night. Mrs. Grierson gave a hasty glance after her, and then, with a mysterious air, produced a"], [189, "DUNCAN MORAY. 181 newspaper which she had by her, hidden behind a sofa cushion. ' I have done an excellent stroke of business,' she said, drawing her chair a little nearer to her listeners, ' but I did not want her to hear about it. I am sure they never see the paper, the Kirhness Argus. This is it. A smart clever young fellow came over from Kirkness, the other day, to ask the Admiral all about the railway. The Admiral was out, so I had him in and told him all about it. He took down everything I said, and then he asked, \" Hadn't you a queer murder about here, not very long since ? \" I told him the whole story, and he noted that down too. I asked him why he did that, and he said he could work it all in easily, and it would make a very smart article, and that people would be much more certain to read it, with such a story in it. I thought that was an excellent notion, and he has done it so cleverly. Here it is. He begins about the railway being a radical job, to catch the middle aud small trading class, and therefore, as the line it follows makes no difference to them, it is to be"], [190, "DUNCAN MORAY. 182 carried out without the least regard to land owners, farmers, and others, who are mostly Con servatives. Then he goes on, \" One of the most spirited and determined opposers of the projected route is, we understand, Mr. Elliott of Beechwood, on whose estate the well-known Corran granite quarry is situated, and whose place, it may be re membered, was the scene, last year, of the mysterious murder of Mr. Moray, the much respected proprietor of Craignellan, etc.\" Then he goes on really to tell the whole story, and dis cuss the extraordinary escape of the murderer. He has managed it most cleverly. He has mixed it all up in such a way that people are sure to read the whole article. I hope, though, the Elliotts will not see it. I don't think they would like it much.' ' Well, no, I should think not,' said Mrs. Alison. ' You remember what strange things were said.' ' All most contemptible gossip and nonsense,' said Mrs. Millar, tartly. ' Mr. Millar was speaking of it, a short time since, to the senior partner in"], [191, "DUNCAN MORAY. 183 the Dempsters' firm. He says those Edinburgh people have not a shadow of a case.' ' Oh, he's bound to say that, of course,' retorted Mrs. Alison. Isabel Elliott, meantime, had strolled along a gravel walk which led through the shrubberies down to the bank of the Corran, in that listless meutal condition, when it is difficult to say if one is thinking about anything at all. She had certainly no further defined intention than to keep out of the drawing-room for as long as she could venture to do so without running the risk of attracting notice. Suddenly her senses brought her back into a more coherent frame of mind. Her nose took in the scent of a cigar, and her eyes that specially shaped and sized expanse of white, shining out from the surrounding gloom, which indicated the close proximity of a shirt front. Walter Millar had just emerged from a side path. Isabel Elliott blessed the friendly darkness which prevented her suddenly deepened colour from being perceptible \u2014 and misleading. The encounter was the last she would willingly have"], [192, "184 DUNCAN MORAY. risked. She had seen very little of Walter Millar for some weeks, as little as possible, indeed, since the day when Mrs. Campbell's unlucky indiscretion had allowed her to become aware that Duncan Moray regarded it as utterly impossible that she could ever fall below herself so much as to think of marrying a man whom she had undoubtedly, in a desultory, indeterminate sort of fashion, occa sionally thought of as a possible husband. And as Walter Millar had thought he observed a slight coolness about her, and had begun to attribute it to a possible opinion on Miss Elliott's part that he was hanging back too long, it must be admitted the encounter was fraught with perilous conditions. ' I hope I did not startle you, Miss Elliott,' he said, as he threw away his cigar, perceiving her abrupt halt. I imagine we are both fugitives from the same wearisome topic' ' I suppose so. I am sure I shall soon have railway engines on the brain, and dream every night of an army of ferocious navvies breaking into the house.' 'They are at it hard in the dining-room. I"], [193, "DUNCAN MORAY. 185 could not stand it any longer, so slipped out of the window unobserved, under cover of looking at a picture.' He had placed himself at her side, and Miss Elliott pursued her walk, discreetly making for a path which would soon bring her back to the house. She was apparently now by no means averse to discuss the railway. ' What a ridiculous agitation it seems,' she said ; ' does it not ? I suppose this sort of thing always goes on whenever a railway is first made in a neighbourhood; but that is such a rare occurrence now.' ' Oh, yes.

No, that was not what I was thinking about. But really the course the line would take, whichever scheme is adopted, makes very little difference to Southend. There are some advantages and some disadvantages in both. From a commercial point of view I do not think it would make the least difference. I was thinking of personal preference. I do not now feel so certain about the future of Southend.' ' At any rate,' replied Miss Elliott, firmly cling ing to the railway, ' it must be an advantage to have a railway near.' ' I wonder which course you would think the preferable one for Southend ? ' he suddenly said. ' I wish you would come and give us your advice.

A NEWSPAPER PjiRAGRAPH. sPHE budding journalist who had interviewed -*- Mrs. Grierson had certainly good cause to be satisfied with the result of his labours. His smart column was very effective, and promptly drew the Glentrae Sentinel, which angrily inquired if the people of Rossan and the neighbourhood were going to allow dust to be thrown in their eyes in that way, just to prevent them from seeing how the landowners, and the Conservative farmers with whom they had taken good care to pack the country, were trying to carry everything their own way, without the least regard to the welfare of the trading classes, who would after all be the best supporters of the railway ?

That was a story which, under any circumstances, a Conservative paper had better leave alone : but the Glentrae Sentinel did not suppose the Kirkness Argus had ability enough at its command to secure a really good article on such a subject, without a heap of ridiculous padding being thrown in. There was much reading of both these articles in Rossan, and much hurling of the rival arguments at the heads of political opponents. 01 course some sincere friend sent off copies, at once, of both papers to Duncau Moray, with the paragraphs marked, and the red herring specially underlined. Never was red herring more successfully used. No one who reached that paragraph thought any more about how the interests of the trading classes had been sacrificed. What did the question mean ? The Sentiixel would never have asked it without meaning something. What connection could there"], [200, "192 DUNCAN MORAY. be between the murder of old Mr. Moray, and the course of the new railway ?

Of course Mrs. Fordyce got hold of the story, but this was a case too grave for any trifling, and Mr. Fordyce promptly silenced her by a few threats, uttered in a tone which she did not often hear him assume."], [203, "DUNCAN MORAY. 195 Mr. Elliott was not given to the study of local papers, so he remained wholly unconscious of the evil reputation which was rendering him an object of mingled terror and fascination, at least to all the women and children in Rossan. The village saw a good deal of him, for there were sundry arrangements to be made with respect to the projected meeting, and he certainly appeared to be in most excellent spirits. A mirthful Mephis topheles they would have called him, had then erudition been at all on a par with their imagina tion. ' It's bad eneuch when a man's just extra bad,' they said.

Rossan possessed a very fair hall for meetings, calculated to hold, when well packed, some three hundred people, and a vigorous cleaning was going on, which was watched with keen interest. Then there was much stir at the Beechwood Arms, where Mrs. Dunn was busy with many prepara tions inside, while ostlers were making room for an unusual influx of carriages. There were not probably more than half-a-dozen houses in Rossan where tea was anything more than a remote possi bility, when the first of the quarrymen appeared in the distance, returning from work. The legitimate sources of distraction, moreover, were not the only ones with which Rossan was favoured that day. A new and wholly unexpected object of curiosity suddenly appeared, and gave rise to a host of excited conjectures. A group of alert matrons had been gathered around Mrs. Hamilton's door, about three o'clock in the after noon, eagerly speculating- on what might be the meaning of the arrival at the Beechwood Arms of a groom from The Rowans, with a note, for an"], [205, "DUNCAN MORAY. 197 answer to which he appeared to be waiting, when Mrs. Hamilton, glancing in the opposite direction, exclaimed : ' Why, wha's yon man comin' doun the street ? I dinna think I ken him.' Every eye was at once fixed upon the stranger, and the groom, after receiving a note from Mrs. Dunn herself, rode away unobserved. The man was walking slowly down the street, looking about him in a half hesitating way. All that was evident about him was that he was tall, elderly, sufficiently well dressed to indicate comfortable circumstances, and wholly unknown to anyone in Rossan. There was not even room for the exciting hope that he might turn out to be Mrs. Donaldson's first hus band, whose death at sea had never been absolutely proved, because Captain Haigg had been under five feet six, and the stranger was certainly six feet in height. He came at last to where the women were standing, eyeing him in absorbed silence. Then he paused, and asked : ' Can ye tell me the way to Craignellan ? ' ' To Craignellan ?

The stranger meanwhile slowly pursued his way, ascending the hill with leisurely steps, and pausing not unfrequently to look about him ; but more with the air of a man tired by a long walk, than with that of one interested in what he saw. He was not altogether a pleasing looking person. His dress and bearing suggested a respectable position, but his face bore traces of habits of dissipation. His knock at the door of the house at Craig nellan was answered by Mrs. Campbell herself. ' Does Mr. Moray live here ? ' he asked. ' He did ; but he doesn't noo.' ' Why, where is he gane ?

Something in the speech mollified Mrs. Campbell a little; probably her Scottish hospitality was touched, by the reference to ' a lang road,' con firmed by the speaker's dusty appearance, aud by a ring of weariness in his voice. She answered more graciously. ' Yese best come awa in, then, an' see my man. He's in the hoose just noo. He's cousin to Mr. Moray, an' is just looking after things here a bit for him. He'll likely be able to tell ye a' ye want to ken.'

He had only his own word for the truth of what he said, and Campbell had, of course, not lived at Craignellan for several months without hearing a good many current theories, especially as to the possibility of Mr. Elliott being not wholly in a position to set black mailers at defiance.

' Yes, I saw it,' she said. ' I chanced to get a paper. I meant to have shown it to you. I thought it rather clever. What harm is there in it?' ' Harm ? Do you want to make yourself out a fool, Leonora ? After all the gossip and scandal there was, isn't there harm enough in the whole thing being brought up again. It would be very annoying in any case, but in that of a man whose antecedents are, to say the least of it, open to question, it is downright mischievous.' ' Well, I am sure, it did not strike me in that light. I thought it was rather a clever idea to weave in an incident sure to interest people in such an article, so as to insure everyone reading it.' ' Pshaw ! I only wish I could give that young ass a taste of the rope end to teach him not to go about prying and poking that way into other people's affairs.' ' The Elliotts will never see it.

There is certainly a mystery in the business somewhere, and when that is the case, absolute letting alone is the only safe course.' That week had consequently been one of some dread to Mrs. Grierson, although she had at once written notes to all the recipients of her confi dences on the previous evening, telling them that she found there was some objection taken to the way in which the information she had given had been made use of, and begging them, therefore, not to mention her name in connection with it. However, as day after day passed, and the Admiral showed no signs of having heard anything more upon the subject, she began to breathe more freely again.

The hall in which meetings were held in Rossan had a sort of semi-official character, being under the control of the bailies and council for the time being, and the scene of all official meetings. The actual hall itself was not much used, gather ings of a sort calculated to fill it being rare in Rossan. But from a passage running along one side of it there opened several rooms, which were in constant use for heritors and parochial board meetings, and other assemblies of a like important but limited character. Immediately opposite to the room at the upper end of the passage was the door which gave access to the platform. Peter Hamilton, the bellman, was the official who had charge of the building, and he and Mr. Elliott had"], [225, "DUNCAN MORAY. 217 had some discussion over the arrangements for the evening. 'There'll be a crowded room, sir, there's nae twa ways about that,' he said. ' It's nae vera aften they get a chance to hear the member. But I'm feared there'll be some disturbance.' 'Ah! Why?' 'Weel, sir, them that's against the railway passing close by the kirk, an' the Radicals, is sure to try it on. They'll get a pack o' boys to come and make a row.' Mr. Elliott frowned. ' If I could get down in time I'd soon arrange that. But Colonel Malcolm and some others dine with me. Can't you get a few of the quarrymen you can depend on ? ' ' Oh, yes, I could do that' \u2022 Then get a few dozen to come in good time. They'll know the dangerous ones, as they come in. Make them mix themselves up with them, and break them up, so that no great lot of them shall get all together. They'll not do much then.' ' I'll try it, sir. An' what ither rooms will ye want ? '"], [226, "218 DUNCAN MORAY. ' Oh, just the end room for us to assemble in ; and you had better put a light in one of the other rooms, in case any of the ladies would like to leave wraps there. See that the place is lighted up in good time, and put plenty of chairs on the platform. A good many of the gentlemen will go on to it, I think.' With that Mr. Elliott went his way, and mount ing his horse, trotted rapidly home, in order to be ready in time for the unusually early dinner hour, which the meeting necessitated. By the time he reached the house, Mr. Henderson, accommodated with another pretty stiff glass of whisky toddy, was chatting in the bar with Mr. Dunn, over the railway question, and the impending meeting ; and announcing his intention of going to bed forth with, as he was dead tired. Whatever might be the source of Mr. Elliott's bouyant spirits, they seemed in some way to have infused themselves into his daughter. She had been tripping about the house all day, with far more liveliness and vivacity than bad been usual with her of late, arranging flowers, and superin-"], [227, "DUNCAN MORAY. 219 tending all the preparations for the dinner pre ceding the meeting. The guests who were to come from a further distance had been, by precon certed arrangement, divided between Beechwood and The Rowans. Colonel Malcolm, Walter and Laura Millar, and some others, were to dine at Beeehwood ; the Alisons, Mr., Mrs., and Miss Millar, and others at The Rowans ; and the whole party was solemnly trysted to meet at the hall in Rossan, fully a quarter before eight o'clock. Such a distinguished assemblage, Mrs. Grierson laughingly declared, she believed would have never before beeu collected in Rossan. The dinner at Beechwood was an exceedingly lively one. Mr. Elliott was always a good host, and in his present spirits he was a brilliant one. Miss Elliott also was more than ordinarily vivacious, a fact in some measure due to a little nervous excitement, resulting from the conscious ness that after the garden episode at The Rowans, it was not possible that her present relations to the Millars could be of long continuance. She looked extremely handsome, and being well sup-"], [228, "220 DUNCAN MORAY. ported by Col. Malcolm, made really a most admirable hostess. Of all the party, Walter Millar alone was disposed to be grave and silent He had not forgotten his mother's remarks, and the fact that Col. Malcolm was much struck with his hostess was quite patent to eyes so deeply in terested as his. Col. Malcolm's only daughter, a lively girl, just out, had fallen to his charge ; and she curtly pronounced him, to herself, a very heavy young fellow. ' Upon my word,' Col. Malcolm said, 'It will be quite an ordeal for a bashful man like me. I sup pose all the men will come up on the platform, and I shall see just before me nothing but a brilliant row of many hued loveliness. I shall lose my head, and make a mess of it' ' Shall we all take our umbrellas, and put them up when you begin to speak ? ' Isabel asked. ' To keep off the dreary drip ? No, I think that would be too dispiriting. I have faced a good many platform difficulties, but I do not think I could speak to a forest of umbrellas. I"], [229, "DUNCAN MORAY. 221 hope the hall has been decorated, in honour of this important occasion.' ' I fear not. It is sad neglect. What a splendid thing we might have done in frescos ! A sort of look on this picture and on that. On one side the Corran valley, all a raging flood, with cows, sheep, and hens and cocks swimming about. My father, damp aud disconsolate, perched in the branches of a semi-submerged tree, and Mr. Gillespie calling out, \" I told you so,\" from tha window of his ark, as he floated by. Then on the other side we might have had a brilliant scene, all sunshine and vegetation, with corpulent sheep and cows gorging themselves on preternaturally luxuriant grass, while a railway train glided smoothly along the hill side. It is a grand oppor tunity lost. But we had no artist' 'You might have done it yourself,' said one of the party. ' No, no ; I have no skill in portrait paiutiug. Such au injury would have justified Mr. Gillespie in seeking to assassinate me on the first oppor-"], [230, "DUNCAN MORAY. 222 tunity, and my father in cutting me off with the proverbial shilling.' ' You are only a word painter,' said Col. Malcolm, laughingly. 'But what are the arrange ments for the meeting, Mr. Elliott? I know Grierson takes the chair. He won't say much. He is no speaker, and, unlike most people who have no gift that way, he never tries to speak.' ' No, he won't say more than half a dozen seutences. Then we thought Alison might make a short oration on behalf of the people further down the valley. He is to be a light entree in fact You follow as the substantial piece of the evening, aud I wiud up with a little philanthropy, kindly prepared for me by my daughter, and a vote of thauks to you. I cannot, you see, venture to say very much. I do not kuow enough of the place yet. But I thiuk my daughter's exhaustive study on the quarrymen's boots will provide all I want. Then someone else is to vote thanks to Grierson, and that will end it. That is about our idea, but of course it is subject to modification.'"], [231, "DUNCAN MORAY. 223 ' I don't think you could do better. Unless we could induce Miss Elliott to speak herself.' ' And explain the inherent tendency of railway engines to explode with fearful violence, if they are kept working too entirely on flat low lying ground ? ' Isabel asked, laughingly. ' I should not thiuk of wastiug my oratorical powers on any less scientific subject. What an exhaustive meet ing it would be ! Politics, philanthropy, and science ? Shall we go ? ' she added, to her father's partner. ' I think the carriage will be round in about ten minutes.' 'What a delightful dinner, Isabel!' Laura Millar said, as they met on the stabs, comiug dowu cloaked for the drive. ' I never saw you so lively. You do not know how much it improves you. Why are you not always like that?' ' One does not always feel in a mood for fooling,' she replied. ' Besides, some people do not help one on at dinner. Col. Malcolm does. He always manages to say something which suggests a further remark.' ' I think the influence was mutual,' Miss Millar"], [232, "DUNCAN MORAY. 224 replied, laughing. ' I have often met Colonel Malcolm before, but I never saw him in such good form.' Rossan was in a high state of excitement by the time the party from Beechwood arrived; dogs running about and barking in an objectless manner, and children swarming over the ill-lighted street in a way to drive a harrassed coachman to frenzy. Much cheering for Colonel Malcolm brought Peter Hamilton hurrying to the entry to direct and take instructions. ' No, sir ; the Admiral isn't come yet,' he replied to Mr. Elliott's question, ' but the room is crammed full already. I hae kepit the front row o' chairs for the leddies, and we've managed fine about ony disturbance. A hantle o' big boys came, but when they found we broke them up, an' wad na hae them a' in a heap together, a gude few went awa' again. I doubt there'll be nae disturbance to speak o'. Here comes the Admiral's party, sir. This is the room for the leddies, Miss Elliott.' The select assemblage filed up the passage to their respective quarters for the last final touches"], [233, "DUNCAN MORAY. 225 of arrangement, while the crowded audience in the hall began those periodical demonstrations which indicate that an impatient public considers that it is time the proceedings should begin. Isabel Elliott, in passing through the entry, had exchanged friendly salutations with Mrs. Campbell, who was waiting there for her husband. They had started early from Craignellan, for John Campbell's hypotheses as to the probable proceed ings of his unwelcome guest had not wholly reassured himself, and he purposed making some cautious inquiries as to his proceedings subse quently to his leaving Craignellan, especially with the design of finding out, if possible, whether he had beeu sowing information as to the object of his visit in the fruitful soil of Rossau's thirst for knowledge? Temperance notwithstanding, he devoutly hoped it might prove that Mr. Henderson had got very drunk and gone to bed, as there was in view the not impossible alternative of his getting rather drunk aud coming to the meeting. In this case he would be just in the state to render it highly probable that, on catching Mr. Elliott's 2 P"], [234, "DUNCAN MORAY. 226 name, he would start up, and with all the dogged persistency incidental to his condition, insist on interviewing him on the spot regarding James Carfrae, and the possibility that his previous connection with Mr. Elliott might afford some clue by means of which he might yet be traced \u2014 a pro ceeding which, to say the least of it, would be extremely inconvenient. 'Eh, Mr. Campbell, is that yersel?' exclaimed the jovial landlord of the Beechwood Arms, as John Campbell entered the house. 'Man, but ye'se best no linger if ye want a seat. They say the hall is crammed as full as it'll hold. But, I say, wha's yon man ye had up at Craignellan the day?' ' I ken naught o' him. He was seeking my cousin.' ' What did he want wi' him ? ' ' I believe he'd ben't the auld man,' replied Campbell, discreetly, not a little satisfied at a question which seemed to imply that Mr. Hender son had been judiciously reticent over his business. Is he in the noo ? '"], [235, "DUNCAN MORAY. 227 ' I doubt he's awa' to his bed. He said he was tired, an' weel he might be if he walked frae Kirkness the day. Were ye wanting him ? ' ' Oh, no. But he lookit to me like a man ower fond o' a dram, an' I'd just a fear he might get tasting an' then come to the meeting an' may be get excited an' noisy. I gave bim something to eat, an' I saw he took kindly to the whisky.' 'He had some mair after he came in,' replied the landlord, ' an' I'll no say but he's gey weel on. But he went oot to the post-office, an' said he wad be awa' to his bed as soon as he came in. I've no seen him since. Hae ye seen yon man, Janet?' he added, to a servant lassie who came hurrying by at the moment. ' I think he's awa to his bed. Some one gaed up a wee while since. I think it was him.' With a lightened heart John Campbell pro ceeded to join his wife at the hall, and report this satisfactory information. ' Heaven send they may be right,' she said, ' for some way I've an awfu' nervous feeling aboot"], [236, "DUNCAN MORAY. 228 him, an' it's ill wark getting a drunk man to haud his tongue.' ' Hi, Mr. Campbell ! ' called out one of the local officials, as they were trying to effect an entry into the crowded hall, 'come this way, up the passage. Ye maun gang on to the platform, man. Ye're Craignellan's representative, ye ken. We've managed to keep a few seats near the front row. Mrs. Campbell '11 get a seat there.' ' Hoot, man, I'll nae gang on the platform. I've naething to do wi' the place. I dinna even ken Craignellan's opinion aboot the matter. I'll no mak' a fule o' mysel' meddling.' ' Weel, weel, as ye please. But come forrard. Ye can go in by the platform door, and get a seat wi' Mrs. Campbell near the front.' The Campbells obeyed, and found sundry vacant seats in the second row of chairs, on that side of the passage down the middle of the hall which was nearest to the platform entrance. ' Gang richt up to the end, John,' whispered his wife, making way for him to go first. ' Then ye"], [237, "DUNCAN MORAY. 229 can stand up against the wall for a bit, an' look ower the folk if he should come in.' That position Mr. Campbell kept until a great stamping of feet announced that the form of Admiral Grierson had appeared in the doorway. Then he sat down with a sigh of relief. ' I think it's a' safe noo,' he whispered to his wife. ' I canna make him oot onywhere, an' the hall's that crowded doun by the door I dinna think he'd hae a chance to get in if he tried.' Admiral Grierson had behind him a considerable following, as it was intended that the meeting should appear as widely representative as possible. Colonel Malcolm was immediately behind the chairman, and then came Mr. Alison. Mr. Elliott, following him, passed at once to the further end of the platform, and seated himself on a chair in the back row. By the time the whole party were seated, the platform was tolerably crowded The ladies came streaming in at the rear of the speakers, and soon settled down in the places reserved for them, Isabel Elliott almost in front of the Campbells, with Mrs. Grierson and Miss"], [238, "230 DUNCAN MORAY. Malcolm close to her. Mrs. Grierson had headed the procession, and had been on the point of passing on to the further side of the hall, but at sight of the obnoxious young journalist, com placently seated at the reporters' table, she had abruptly appropriated the first vacant chair she reached, dreading that the ill-conditioned youth might possibly venture to salute the stately dame who had been so gracious to him. Admiral Grierson justified Colonel Malcolm's eulogium. He was not a fluent speaker, and he did not seek to offer proof of that fact. He only made a few brief opening remarks, and then calling on Mr. Alison, sat down. Mr. Alison, who was a fair speaker, proceeded to explain how entirely the dwellers in the lower reaches of the Corran valley were brethren in misfortune to the inhabitants of Rossan, and to delate on the special disasters which this ill-advised selection of route for the railway must entail upon them. The Rossan people, of course, knew the local conditions far better than he could do, but he could surely say that those whom he specially represented that"], [239, "DUNCAN MORAY. 231 night looked anxiously to Rossan for aid and united action. The only local centre near to them was Dalmuir, which, so long as the railway came, cared not a whit what route it followed, and could not therefore be counted upon for any co-operation in the matter. He made a neat and effective little speech, and was much applauded ; the efforts of the organized opposers being very half-hearted, under the depressing arrangements effected. Then Colonel Malcolm followed, and as adroitly as the budding journalist had mingled the subject with interesting gossip, so did he contrive to mingle it with stirring political matter ; making the subject on which he was supposed to speak, without appearing to set it on one side, merely the text of a first rate political address. ' Admirable,' murmured Mrs. Grierson to Isabel Elliott, 'what an excellent speaker he is!' And Mrs. Millar, from the opposite side of the hall, looked across a little jealously, to see what effect Colonel Malcolm's eloquence was producing on Miss Elliott. Miss Elliott's eyebrows had gone up,"], [240, "232 DUNCAN MORAY. and she wore a slightly bored expression. She was very tired of this somewhat fictitious grievance. Colonel Malcolm was really a man of ability, as well as an astute politician, and for the first ten minutes John Campbell listened to him with no little interest. But then his arm was suddenly grasped by his wife, with a whispered ' Eh, John ! ' Following the direction of her eyes, he looked towards the platform entrance, and all his allayed uneasiness re-asserted itself with tenfold force. Leaning against the door post stood the object of his fears, apparently quietly listening to Colonel Malcolm's speech. Coming in after all watch upon the entrance had been relaxed he had probably strolled up the passage unobserved. That was John Campbell's first hypothesis, but observing that the man, either by accident or design, had in his hand a note-book and pencil, the likelihood occurred to him that he had been taken for a reporter. Not a word more of Colonel Malcolm's speech did John Campbell hear. To a total stranger there was nothing about the man calculated"], [241, "DUNCAN MORAY. 233 specially to attract attention. But a certain change in his appearance since the afternoon at once convinced Campbell that he was not quite sober. What was to be done? Mrs. Campbell turned a frightened imploring look upon her husband, but he could only shake his head. He could not move himself, without causing consider able disturbance. Moreover, to interfere with a respectably dressed stranger, standing quietly where he was in no one's way to listen to a speech at a public meeting, would undoubtedly be a rather high-handed proceeding. There seemed to be nothing for it but to let well alone, and hope for the best. After maintaining his position for a short time, the man advanced into the hall, still moving with evident care to make no noise, and seated himself on the steps leading to the platform. Then he opened his note-book, and began apparently to study some notes. Everyone was absorbed in listening to the speaker, and no one, save the Campbells, appeared to have noticed the intruder. John Campbell watched him with the keenest"], [242, "DUNCAN MORAY. 234 anxiety. What was he doing ? He was evidently not listening to Colonel Malcolm. Did he really know where he was ? or had he merely wandered in at the open door, in the aimless way of a man confused with drink ? Was there a hope that he might not recognize Mr. Elliott's name, when Admiral Grierson announced it ? If only that danger were safely surmounted, there would be little to fear, for there would be nothing after wards to betray to him the identity of the speaker. Presently hope again sprang up in the hearts of the two anxious watchers. The man was growing drowsy. After a sudden nod, he rested his elbow on the step above him, and settling himself back, as comfortably as he could, leaned his head upon it. If he would only go fast asleep ! He would probably fall if he did, but in that case a momentary disturbance in removing him would be all that need be feared. Had Colonel Malcolm only continued to speak a few moments longer, the situation would have been probably thus saved ; for after one or two rousings of himself up, and shifting of his position,"], [243, "DUNCAN MORAY. 235 the stranger's drowsiness was clearly fast gaining the mastery over him. But just as John Campbell hoped his slumber was really becoming confirmed, the speech came to an end, and at the burst of applause which followed, he woke up with a start, and raised himself from his partially recumbent position. Campbell's heart beat fast. He had been told that Mr. Elliott would be the next speaker. Why in the world should he feel so nervous? A dis agreeable incident seemed to be the only thing to be feared, nothing that need arouse such extreme anxiety. Admiral Grierson rose, and after a few complimentary remarks upon Colonel Malcolm's speech, announced in, as it seemed to John Campbell, most needlessly stentorian tones, that Mi-. Elliott would say a few words. The announcement was greeted with a most vigorous demonstration on the part of the quarry men, who knew that Mr. Elliott intended to con stitute himself the champion of then- right to protest against a proposal calculated to increase considerably their distance from their work. For"], [244, "DUNCAN MORAY. 236 a moment the uproar was tremendous ; but it was only for a moment. Suddenly it died away in the deadest stillness which ever fell upon a crowded assembly, and every man held his breath, in amazed contemplation of an incident as startling as unexpected. When Admiral Grierson mentioned the name of Elliott, the stranger rose from his lowly seat, and turning, stood just at the corner of the platform, looking up with evident interest to catch a sight of the expected speaker. Mr. Elliott, rising at the same moment from his seat in the back row, at the opposite end of the platform, stepped forward, and passing round the man sitting directly before him, advanced towards the small centre table placed immediately in front of the chairman. Thus he and the unwelcome intruder came momentarily face to face. A startled exclamation escaped the man ; Mr. Elliott stopped dead; and they stood glaring at one another in silence. Only a momentary silence. Then the stranger, dashing down his note-book and pencil with a"], [245, "DUNCAN MORAY. 237 gesture of the wildest excitement, exclaimed in a voice which rang through the hall. ' That, Mr. Elliott ? '\u2014That is James Carfrae ! '"], [246, "DUNCAN MORAY. 238 CHAPTER XL BEFORE HIS JUDGE. \"VTOT a soul in the hall moved, the silence might \"*\u25a0* be felt, and every eye was fixed upon Mr. Elliott. He stood perfectly motionless, but the livid ghastly palor which spread itself over his face is undescribable, and more than one spectator shuddered at the fiendish expression with which he looked at his accuser. Only for a moment, however, did the two men glare at one another in silence. Then, in an excited tone, Henderson continued \u2014 ' Ay, yon's James Carfrae, the man that murdered my puir brither, an' then came red handed to make frien's wi' me in anither part of the country, that he might rob me too. An' if it was Carfrae that murdered Mr. Moray, yonder stands the man that did it. Ay, Carfrae, ye devil in human form, ye ken me fine, as weel as I ken"], [247, "DUNCAN MORAY. 239 you. I swore I'd be even wi' ye some day, an' the day's come.' Then, without speaking, Mr. Elliott strode suddenly along the platform, in the direction of the speaker. More than one spectator started up in alarm, and Henderson rapidly assumed an attitude of defence. But Mr. Elliott, hastily descending the steps, merely flung the man aside, with a violent motion of his arm, and disappeared from the hall. Henderson, not sober enough to be perfectly steady, staggered back upon the first row of chairs, and would have fallen bodily upon Miss Malcolm if she and some of the other ladies had not jumped up and started aside. As it was, he came to the ground amidst a crashing of over turned chairs. In a moment all was uproar and confusion, the whole place was filled with a surging shouting crowd, and more than one scream was heard. Isabel Elliott, driven back against the wall, felt her arm grasped almost roughly, and fouud Mr. Gillespie, with a face as white as a ghost, close beside her."], [248, "240 DUNCAN MORAY. 'Come this way,' he said. 'Help me, Campbell;' and with more force than gentleness, the two strong men made a way for her to the platform entrance, and almost dragged her from the hall. Mr. Gillespie hastily opened the door of a small room, lower down the passage than those they had made use of, and as soon as she was safely within it, locked the door. ' Bide ye here a moment,' he said. ' I can bring the carriage to this ither door.' He was gone in a moment, through a door opposite to that by which they had entered. It gave access to a narrow side lane, from which, a little further down, on the opposite side, there was also an entrance to the stable yard of the Beech wood Arms. Stunned, bewildered, but quite quiet, only trembling in every limb, the poor girl stood alone in the bare cold room, lighted only by the smoky flame of an unsnuffed tallow candle, listening to the din and tumult without. Hurried steps passed up and down the passage, and eager voices were heard in excited colloquy, mingled with the trampling of horses' hoofs without, and"], [249, "DUNCAN MORAY. 241 the loud warning shouts of the drivers to the crowd in the street. More than once the door of the room was tried, and once she heard a voice saying peremptorily, ' Here, Hamilton, let us through this way,' and the reply, 'I cauna find the key, sir. Somone has locked the door, an' ta'en it awa.' It seemed an age to her ere she heard the sound of a carriage drawing up at the door. Then Mr. Gillespie re-entered the room. ' Come quick,' he said, and hurrying her into the carriage, was stepping in after her. ' But my father ! ' she said. ' Where is he.' ' Awa hame. My dogcart was at the door. He jumpit in an' drove himsel' aff, straucht awa.' ' Oh, Mr. Gillespie,' she said, in a voice that trembled so much it was hardly audible. ' What is it ? What does it mean ? ' ' Oh, dinna ask me, my puir lassie,' he replied, grasping her hand with a fervent pressure; and then his voice broke into an audible sob. Not a word more did Isabel speak, as they drove rapidly towards Beechwood. 2 Q"], [250, "DUNCAN MORAY. 242 Almost at the moment when Mr. Gillespie had locked the door of the small room behind her, the select portion of the assembly had come streaming after her through the platform door, and down the passage; many of them presenting a somewhat disordered appearance, and all in a state of the wildest excitement. The women were hastily escorted as far as the Beechwood Arms, and left there, in a private sitting-room, while the men re turned to the hall to investigate this marvellous incident. Mrs. Grierson threw herself down on a couch, and fanned herself vehemently. ' I never went through such a horrible experience in my life. I thought we should all be killed. I nearly fainted with terror. Catch me ever going to such a place again. Why, good gracious,' she added, glancing round, ' Where is Miss Elliott ? Was she knocked down and trampled upon ? ' 'Certainly not,' replied Miss Malcolm, in an injured tone. ' It was I who was nearly knocked down. Two men got hold of ber, and forced a way for her, most rudely, to the door. I don't"], [251, "DUNCAN MORAY. 243 know who they were. One of them came down from the platform.' 'Oh, that would be Mr. Gillespie,' said Mrs. Grierson; 'she will be all right, so it is really rather lucky she is not here, it would have been very awkward. What in the world can all this mean ? Who was the man ? ' 'I think he must have been a reporter,' Miss Malcolm replied. ' He was close to us. He sat on the steps. He had a note-book and pencil.' 'I believe he was drunk, and did not know what he was saying,' put in Mrs. Millar. ' He said Mr. Elliott was James Carfrae. That is non sense.' ' I don't think he was drunk,' said Mrs. Alison, who did not mind giving Mrs. Grierson a smite. ' I believe it is that paragraph in the Argus. I think the man knew well enough what he was saying. I believe it is a trick to extort money.' ' Nonsense,' replied Mrs. Grierson, curtly. ' It looks much more like a case of mistaken identity. The Carfraes were old family servants of the Elliotts. Queer things happen, sometimes, under"], [252, "244 DUNCAN MORAY. those circumstances. There may be some likeness. I wonder how long they will be ? It is very dis agreeable here \u2014 such a horrible smell of tobacco and beer ; and I am sure some of those men about the entrance were drunk.' ' Couldn't we manage, with a little arranging, to go home at once,' suggested Mrs. Alison, ' and leave carriage room enough for them to follow ? I daresay they could let them have a dog-cart, or something, for some of them. It is not cold, and they have all got great coats.' A lively discussion followed, and then Mr. Dunn was summoned. A dog-cart could certainly be had. So after a little more fussing, and leaving of messages for masculine belongings, they all got under way.' Those masculine belongings were, by that time, all looking very grave and perplexed. A sort of irregular investigation had been held in the com mittee room. Henderson, perfectly sobered by the shock aud surprise, stuck to his assertion with unshaken persistency, and was not to be beguiled into any attempts to explain what he had no"], [253, "DUNCAN MORAY. 245 means of explaining. How the transformation came about he did not profess to understand; but he was as certain that the man he had faced upon the platform was the James Carfrae he had known so many years before in Australia, as he was of his own identity. 'Whar's the gude o' disputing about it?' he pertinently queried. ' Could ye no see, by the man's face an' doings, that he keht me just as weel as I ken't him ? I never heard of a Mr. Elliott in my life. Yon is just James Carfrae, an' naebody else.' Then an anxious discussion followed. Admiral Grierson aud Mr. Millar were both justices of the peace, and it was only too evident that an inde scribably painful investigation lay before them. ' We cannot do anything to-night, that is clear, ' Admiral Grierson said decidedly. ' The man is collected enough now, but he has unquestionably been drinking. He smells strong of spirits. We are not justified in taking any proceedings until we see if he tells the same story in the morning. We must just direct the police what to do, and"], [254, "DUNCAN MORAY. 246 meet here as early as possible to-morrow morning. By good luck they sent over a couple of men from Kirkness, to attend this meeting, so there is extra help at hand. The police were summoned, duly instructed, and dismissed ; and then the party broke up, to make their way to their respective homes in the best manner the flight of the feminine portion of the contingent rendered possible ; the justices, at least, devoutly wishing themselves anywhere on the whole face of the earth, rather than on that particular spot. The door of Beechwood House opened as the carriage drove up, and the butler, pallid and shaking like a leaf, came out. He turned an indescribable look on Mr. Gillespie, as he got out and helped Miss Elliott to alight, but he did not speak. Isabel walked firmly into the hall, but her face wore a strange, stricken, bewildered expres sion. Marion Boswell was standing in the hall. 'Where is Mr. Elliott? ' Isabel asked. ' In \u2014 in \u2014 the library mem,' gasped the woman,"], [255, "DUNCAN MORAY. 247 with chattering teeth. Isabel looked sharply at her. ' What is the matter? ' He's no vera weel, mem.' 'But what is it? What is wrong?' and she advanced towards the door. The butler clutched Mr. Gillespie's arm. 'For God's sake, stop her,' he gasped. Marion, however, boldly intervened. ' It'll nae be jttst convenient ye sud gang to him the noo, Miss Elliott. Harris was wi' him. Ye'se best come into the drawing-room for a bit, till Dr. Fleming comes. We've sent for him. Mr. Gilles pie an' Harris will bide wi' him meantime.' ' But what is the matter ? ' she persisted. ' I \u2014 I \u2014 canna just say. But it's the men he wants. Ye'd only be in the way. The doctor '11 no be lang.' After another brief moment of hesitation, Isabel yielded, and turned towards the drawing-room, followed by Marion. She asked no further ques tion, she seemed to be hardly conscious what was passing around her. She seated herself on a"], [256, "248 DUNCAN MORAY. couch, and with her cold hands clasped tightly ou her lap, sat gazing rigidly before her. Mr. Gillespie looked inquiringly at the butler, but the man only shook his head. He seemed to be totally unable to speak. Mr. Gillespie turned abruptly, and entered the library. He only remained there a few moments. Then, with a face even whiter than before, he came out again, and locking the door put the key in his pocket. ' Ye've really sent for Dr. Fleming ?' he asked in a low voice, as he rejoined the butler in the hall. ' Yes, sent off directly.' ' What happened ?' asked Mr. Gillespie. ' We were all at supper, and I thought I heard wheels come up to the door. ' Surely,' I said, ' that can't be them coming back yet,' and we listened for a moment. Then we heard a quick step cross the hall. Peter and me jumped up, and came along the passage, to see who it was. Just as we got into the hall, we heard a shot. We rushed into the library, and found him lying just as he is lying now. I saw there was nothing"], [257, "DUNCAN MORAY. 249 could be done, so Peter just jumped into your cart, which was standing at the door, and drove off for Dr. Fleming. I would not allow him to be touched. But, good God, what does it mean, Mr. Gillespie ? They were all as merry as merry could be, at dinner this evening.' Mr. Gillespie shook his head. ' I'm scarce clear mysel' what it means. But I sadly fear it means that this is the best thing that could happen for the puir dear young leddy yonder. God help her, puir lassie ! There was naebody but Duncan, an' Duncan's oot o' a' question noo.' He was more thinking aloud than addressing the puzzled butler. ' You look awfully shaken, Mr. Gillespie,' the man said. ' Will you not come into the dining-room, and have something. I had not begun to clear away yet?' ' I believe I'll be the better of something,' the factor replied. ' I maun keep up, to think for her,' and he followed the man to the dining-room. It was a pitiable sight, far more pitiable than Mr. Gillespie could conceive, not having been present with the merry lighted hearted group who, but so"], [258, "250 DUNCAN MORAY. short a time before, had been assembled, gaily laughing and jesting round the table, all un conscious of the mystic hand, even then writing upon the wall. The table was still covered with crystal and porcelain, just as they had left it, and the flowers Isabel had arranged were still blooming in the vases. And now all that was left of the brilliant host was the lifeless form stretched on the library floor, with the pistol close to his right hand ; while the handsome gracious hostess sat, a lonely stricken woman, cowering in stony be wilderment beside the forsaken fire in the brightly lighted drawing-room. Aud the summer friends, where were they ? Which of them all would come to seek her in her desolation? With his nerves a little steadied by a moderate dose of stimulant, Mr. Gillespie returned to the hall, as he heard wheels again drive up, and silently led Dr. Fleming to the library. A single glance was enough. The bullet had pierced the brain. Death must have been instantaneous. ' But what has happened ? What does it all mean ? I heard most contradictory accounts.'"], [259, "DUNCAN MORAY. 251 Mr. Gillespie shook his head. ' I doubt that's what naebody can tell ye, Doctor. The man started up an' said Mr. Elliott was James Carfrae. That he's no that, everybody kens weel eneuch. But that there maun be something in it that he daur na' face is only too clear. I'll no say but Duncan Moray might throw some licht upon it, if he was here. I've aye thocht he ken't mair than he likit to say. But the truth is, I feel clean bewildered mysel'.' ' Was Miss Elliott at the meeting ? ' That was she, puir lassie, an' ye maun see her. She seems turned into stonelike. I dinna like her looks.' ' Does she know? ' ' I don't think she understands clearly. Mrs. Boswell turned her back from ganging into the room, on the excuse that he was ill, an' wanted Harris and me, an' that it was not convenient for her to gang in. But she's that stunned, I doubt if she understands onything clearly.' ' Where is she?' ' In the drawing-room. Mrs. Boswell is there.'"], [260, "DUNCAN MORAY. 252 ' None of those women come to her ? ' ' Nae fear o' them,' answered the factor, scorn fully. ' But then, ye know, they dinna ken about this.' Dr. Fleming went quietly into the drawing-room. Isabel still sat by the fire in her stony silence. Dr. Fleming looked at her for a moment without speaking. Then he went up to her and gently took her hand. She looked up at him and quietly said \u2014 ' Why are you come here, Dr. Fleming ? ' ' I am come to see you.' ' I have no need of a doctor. They did not send for you to see me but my father. They said he was ill, and they would not let me go into the room. What is the matter? Who is with my father now? What did that man mean? and why did my father go away that way, looking so strange ? I feel so bewildered. I cannot under stand.' 'None of us can understand yet, Miss Elliott. All that is clear is that the man is one whom, for some reason, Mr. Elliott did not dare to meet'"], [261, "DUNCAN MORAY. 253 ' But how ? Why? What has happened to my father? Has he had a fit? You will be able to do something for him ? ' and she started up. ' Mr. Elliott,' replied the doctor, in a low, grave tone, ' has, I grieve to say, rendered it impossible for any one to do anything for him.' She stood silent for a moment, pressing her hand upon her eyes. Then she suddenly removed it and, looking at him steadily, said \u2014 ' You mean that he has taken his own life.' Dr. Fleming did not answer, and after looking at him for a moment she sank back upon her seat and buried her face in her hands, murmuring, ' Yes, that is it. That must be it. I see it now.' She did not move nor speak for a little while, and Dr. Fleming stood silently by her. At last he said, gently, 'You must let me persuade you to go to bed. You have a faithful friend in Mr. Gillespie, who will take charge of everything for you. I will send you a sleeping draught.' ' No. I will not have it. I am not so weak as that. The shock overpowered me. I shall soon be more myself again. Marion, would you bring"], [262, "DUNCAN MORAY. 254 me a glass of wine ; and ask Mr. Gillespie to come here.' She drank the wine when brought to her, and then turned to Mr. Gillespie. ' Is it asking too much,' she said, ' to ask you to come and stay in the house ? ' ' I wad na leave it for a moment, Miss Elliott' ' Thank you. And you will see to everything ? I know things are quite different in Scotland from what they are in England. But I suppose if you manage everything there is nothing I need do ? ' ' Do not trouble yourself in the least, Miss Elliott,' interposed Dr. Fleming. 'Everything shall be arranged without your being in the least disturbed.' A sudden spasm crossed her face. ' Will they not want to see me and ask me questions ? ' she said. ' I would not hear of such a thing,' he replied. ' Not just now, perhaps, but later. When the first shock is over. Could you prevent it then ?' He hesitated. ' I hope it may not be necessary."], [263, "DUNCAN MORAY. 255 But unless I know more I could not positively say.' ' But if I told you now? Perhaps then it would not be necessary that I should be asked any ques tions at all.' ' Is there anything you can tell us,' Dr. Fleming asked, watching her keenly. ' If there is, it might be better you should do so. The more we know, the better will be the chance to keep things quiet' ' I cannot tell anything for certain, but it had come to me \u2014 how it is \u2014 and now \u2014 since I got in, and heard \u2014 I feel sure it must be so \u2014 I feel sure Carfrae died when he was at Oxford \u2014 I am sure I have heard so \u2014 I think it was an accident When he got into trouble there he must have taken the name and gone to Australia. That is all.' The two men looked at each other as the whole dark story seemed in a moment to become clear. ' I am very glad you have told me,' Dr. Fleming said. ' It may enable us to keep things much quieter. And now, I must insist on your going to bed. I shall see you early in the morning.' She quietly wished him good-night, and then"], [264, "256 DUNCAN MORAY. held out her hand to Mr. Gillespie, looking up at him with a strange, wan smile, ' You are the only one left to me,' she said. He well understood what was in her thoughts, and he could not speak. He only tenderly pressed her hand, and then she left the room with Marion. ' My God ! ' exclaimed the factor, as soon as he heard the passage door close. ' What an awful crash ! Nae doubt she's right I see it a' plain. Eh, doctor, how will she ever live through it ? ' ' She'll live through it,' replied the doctor, ' you need have no fear about that. She is not of the sort that are easily killed. But she can hardly fail to suffer severely. The shock is such a fearful one. She is in a strange, unnatural state just now, but she has a splendid physique, and a firm, strong will. It is horrible though to think of her being left in this way so entirely alone. Has she no friends to whom one could write ? ' Mr. Gillespie shook his head. ' I doubt he stood sairly between her an' the making o' mony friends. I'll send ower to Heathfield to-morrow, an' get them to telegraph to Leddy Sinclair. She'll be"], [265, "DUNCAN MORAY. 257 here as soon as mortal can, when she kens. But I'm no vera sure that they can get at her. I've a notion they're yachting.' ' But some of the ladies about would surely come ? ' ' To the daughter o' a murderer, an' a suicide ? Gang an' try them, if ye're so minded,' was the scornful answer. And the two men parted. Peter had chanced to know that Doctor Fleming was visiting that evening at a house a short dis tance down the valley, so he had not sought him in Rossan. Consequently the tragic sequel to the strange events of the evening remained unknown until the following morning, when, after a sleepless night, Adnriral Grierson and Mr. Millar reached the committee room at the Rossan Hall, where Dr. Fleming and Mr. Gillespie were waiting for them. Never probably was a tragical piece of news a source of greater relief, or more heartfelt satis faction to the hearers thereof. Admiral Grierson was a bluff, kind-hearted, old sailor, and the tears were in his eyes as he heard of poor Isabel's all too terribly lucid explanation of the circumstances. 2 R"], [266, "258 DUNCAN MORAY. 'Poor, dear girl,' he said. 'We must do the utmost we can to hush up the matter, for her sake. Where is this man Henderson ? ' ' Mr. Campbell has got haud o' him, sir,' replied Mr. Gillespie. 'I went up early the morn, an' askit him to come doun, an' try an' keep him oot o' folk's way. I tauld Mr. Dunn what had hap pened, an' he promised he wad do a' he could to keep folk frae getting at him. But if we could get him oot o' the place, sir \u2014 .' ' Of course we will. I'll go off instantly to Kirkness, to the Fiscal, and I'll take him with me. How about anyone seeing Miss Elhott, Dr. Fleming? ' ' Not to be thought of for a moment, at present,' he replied. ' Then you had better come with me. Will you come, Millar ? ' ' I do not think it necessary. The less fuss made the better.' ' Good. I think you are right. See to it for us, Gillespie. Order a close carriage and pair to be got ready directly. You must come with us. We"], [267, "DUNCAN MORAY. 259 will get rid of this fellow, and bring Dempster back with us.' The side door which had aided poor Isabel Elliott's escape on the previous evening, served its purpose well on this occasion. All that Rossan, watching from every coign of vantage, could make out, was that Admiral Grierson and Mr. Millar had certainly arrived in the village, but that, after a very brief stay, Mr. Millar had driven away again ; and that shortly after, a close fly had driven out of the stable-yard of the Beechwood Arms, with four men inside, and gone off rapidly in the direction of Kirkness. Over the identity of these four men the wrangle was fierce. The two who sat backwards, and were therefore most easily seen, appeared rather to shun observation. They had slouched their hats low down, and one had rested his arm on the window frame, so as somewhat to shroud his face from view. But the opinion which rapidly fought its way to the apex of the pyramid of excited conjecture, was that the four occupants of the carriage were Admiral"], [268, "260 DUNCAN MORAY. Grierson, and Mr. Elliott in custody of two police men, in plain clothes, being taken to Kirkness to be charged with the murder of Adam Moray."], [269, "DUNCAN MORAY. 261 CHAPTER XII. THE SYMPATHY OF THE SELECT CIRCLE. \"VTEITHER John Campbell nor his wife had thought of going to bed the night after their return from the meeting. In their total ignorance of all the past history of the case, they had got hold of the facts wrong end foremost, aud believed that, at some prior date, Carfrae must have murdered Mr. Elliott, and managed to assume his name, and represent him unsuspected for years. And a longing to see him brought to justice was only tempered by sorrow for the unhappy daughter, and conjectures as to which man was really her father ? ' I canna sleep,' Campbell said. ' I think I'll just sit doun an' write it a' out for Duncan. We maun let him ken at once. There'll be nae end o' a taugle, likely.' ' I wad na' write till to-morrow, if I was you,'"], [270, "DUNCAN MORAY. 262 counselled his wife. ' The hale business is sic a tangle, ye canna tell what may turn up.' Then at six in the morning came Mr. Gillespie, and instantly demolished all their theories. ' Na, na,' he said, ' that's a' wrang. Short o' the puir leddy's explanation, there's nae doubt Mr. Elliott was the richt man. Sir Robert Sinclair said he wad hae ken't him ; an' mony a time he had spoken o' things that happened when he was a laddie here, that auld folk minds aboot. There's nae twa ways about it.

The Lord guard us a' frae the first beginnings o' evil ! But come, Campbell, we maun be aff, to get a haud o' Henderson the first minute he's stirring' As soon as the carriage was safely on its way to Kirkness, Campbell returned home, to set himself to his task of making Duncan Moray aware of the strange events of the last twenty-four hours. ' Eh, woman,' he said to his wife, ' but I canna think hoo he'll tak' it Just think on't His father being sae fond o' that puir young Ieddy, an' Duncan himsel' thinking sae much o' her. An' now to find that his ain father fell by the hand o' her father. I scarce ken whether it's warst for him or for her, puir lassie.' ' Dinna say that,' replied his wife, with tears in her eyes. ' Ye're nae sic a gomeril. Has na Duncan still the memory o' a father that every one loved an' respected to cherish.

' ' A' awa hame, in a fine fluster. But they dinna ken yet what's happened. But Gillespie says they'll nane o' them come nigh her. They'll be awfu' grieved, an' desperately anxious to help her ony way they can, to get awa oot o' the way somewhere, under a changed name likely. But they'll nae come to her.

' Is that the way wi' fine leddies ? ' she asked, at last ' It seems sae.' ' Weel,' she said. ' I hae livit a' my days, till noo, ignorant o' a great mercy the Lord has granted to me. But every time I say my prayers, in future, I'll thank Him I was na born a leddy. Ye can write yer letter, an' see to the hoose, John. I'm aff.' ' Whar are ye ganging ? ' Awa to Beechwood, to see Mrs. Boswell. It's but little the like o' me can do for a leddy in Miss Elliott's position ; but may be I can be o' some use. An' I'm thinking its likely Mrs. Boswell will be glad o' some oue she can trust, to help her, an' nae chatter.' And a most welcome visitor she was. ' Eh, Mrs. Campbell, but I'm proud to see ye,' exclaimed poor Marion, looking a withered ghost of herself.

She made me leave a licht, an' said wad I sleep in the next room. Sleep indeed ! I just lay down on the bed, but she never roused me; an' when I went in the next morning wi' some tea, she was lying quite quiet, but oh wi' sic a look on her face.

Mr. Gillespie has sent word; but we dinna ken weel just whar she is.' It was wearing late in the afternoon when Admiral Grierson, on his way home, set Mr. Dempster and the factor down at the entrance to Beechwood ; and the women gained leave to pro ceed with the melancholy work of making every thing ready against the arrival of the coffin, purposely arranged to take place in the dead of night. Then Mr. Gillespie made his way to the drawing-room. Isabel looked up as he came in, and smiled, that faint wan smile which went to his heart more than anything else. ' How tired you look ! ' she said. 'Come and sit down. 1 fear you have had a very trying day.' ' I'll no bide the noo, Miss Elliott,' he replied. ' I only came to tell ye Mr. Dempster is here, an' that everything is settled so as ye'll nae be disturbed in ony way. Everybody's keen to do a' they can to spare ye ony pain or trouble that can be spared. Ye've naething to do but just arrange"], [277, "DUNCAN MORAY. 269 things with Mr. Dempster, like as it was just a' quite ordinary.' ' Thank you, I'm very glad to know that. But Mr. Gillespie .' She paused, and her face twitched convulsively for a moment. ' Mr. Campbell has written to Duncan Moray,' the factor quietly said. She thanked him with a look. 'Mrs. Campbell is here the noo,' he added. ' She came douu this morning, thinking Marion wad be glad o' some help, an' she'll bide here a bit. She's a sensible, quiet woman, an' nae chatterer.' ' Oh, I am very glad. It will be a help to poor Marion. You are all very good to me. Thank you very much. And now, will you ask Mr. Dempster to come?' ' I'd pretty near as soon walk up to the muzzle of a loaded gun,' the lawyer said when he got the message. ' Never fear, man. Nae condolences or nonsense. Just keep to business. She'll quite understand.' Whether or not Mr. Dempster meant to abide"], [278, "270 DUNCAN MORAY. by that advice no option was left to him. Miss Elliott received him with the same unbroken composure, and took the initiative. ' It is very kind of you to come over at once. I am very ignorant of business, and really do not know if there is anything I must do immediately.' ' Not if you give me authority to act for you. I do not know if you are aware that there is no will?' ' Not ? Are you certain ? ' ' Quite. Mr. Elliott spoke to me about it the last time I saw him. He had made a will some years since, but of course on succeeding, and becoming domiciled in Scotland, he knew it would be necessary to make another. He told me he had destroyed it, and he intended coming to me, next week I think, to give me instructions about drawing up a fresh one.' ' Do you know what his intentions were ? ' ' Not in the least' ' If I knew of any wish I should, of course, have carried it out. But what must I do, Mr. Dempster? Must 1 go away from here immediately ?

Unless you wish to go away, Miss Elliott, I should say your best plan is to remain quietly here until we hear from him. But can I not write for you to some of your friends?' ' I have no friends, she calmly replied \u2014 ' not now \u2014 except Lady Sinclair. I am sure Mr. Gillespie will have writteu to her. She will come as soon as she can.

I feel it difficult even to understand what is said to me. I shall be better after a little.' ' There is only one thing then I must ask you. Shall I look over Mr. Elliott's papers?' 'No,' she replied shortly, almost steruly, 'I will"], [280, "272 DUNCAN MORAY. not allow anyone to do that save myself. I can not undertake it at present. I will do it as soon as I feel able.' At this moment Marion appeared. Dr. Fleming had come. Would Miss Elliott see him ? ' He thinks I want looking after,' she said, ' but I don't. He is very kind though. Yes, I will see him.' Mr. Dempster waited with the factor in the dining-room to hear the doctor's report. He shook his head when he came. ' I do not like it,' he said. ' But it is not entirely due to the shock. I think it is partly that, but she has the pride and strength of a dozen women. She will not give in. There must be a reaction, I fear, and the longer it is put off the more severe it will be. 1 wish Lady Sinclair was here. It is terrible to think of her being so entirely alone. You must watch her carefully,' Mrs. Boswell,' he added, turning to Marion, ' and let me know at once if you see the least symptom which alarms you.

Admiral Grierson, meantime, had driven home, and then, just as she thought the danger was past, such a storm burst upon the head of his wife as she had never known in her life before. A partial account of what had passed at the meeting had reached Mr. Dempster early that morning, connect ing the incident with the Argus article. In much wrath he went off to the editor's office. The editor, happening to have his own reasons for wishing to stand well with Mr. Dempster, sent in search of the writer of that luckless article, and hearing his exculpation of himself, despatched him forthwith to Mr. Dempster's office. Admiral Grierson had just arrived wheu he got there ; he fell with furj' upon the culprit, and the much vituperated youth rather enjoyed taking the wind out of his sails by promptly informing him that it was his own wife who had supplied the informa tion, with the express understanding that it would be published. A somewhat less violent storm might have 2 s"], [282, "DUNCAN MORAY. 274 reduced Mrs. Grierson to hysterics and salvolatile. But when his wrath reached white heat, the bluff old sailor was apt to become rather coarse ; aud thus he stung her into self-assertion and logic. ' It is ridiculous of you to be so violent, Edward,' she said. ' Of course I am very sorry, but had things been as we supposed no harm would have come of it. No one could have conceived the possibility of any such danger as this.' ' You kuew it was a shaky business, and should have kept your confounded babbling to yourself.' ' Well, you know, there are two sides to the question. Deeply as I grieve for poor Miss Elliott, it was really time we knew that we were receiving a murderer among us.' ' I would rather have had half a dozen murderers dining at my table every day,' exclaimed the Admiral, hyperbolically, ' thau that such a blow should have fallen on that poor girl.' ' Oh, really, 1 can hardly go as far as that,' replied his wife, with chilly dignity. ' Now, the question is, what are you going to do for her ? '"], [283, "DUNCAN MORAY. 275 ' My dear Edward, what is there that I can do ? My heart bleeds for her. I can do nothing for thinking about her. But I feel quite powerless.' ' You are not powerless to go to her. Think of her all alone, in that house. It is too horrible ! ' ' There I perfectly agree with you. It is heart rending. But I do not think it would be auy good to go there. It would be a cruel kindness to raise hopes one would only be forced to dis appoint. Aud there is no use shirking the fact. One cannot be on visiting terms, in the ordinary sense of the word, with the daughter of a murderer and a suicide.' An unintelligible mutter, which sounded a good deal like au oath, was the answer. ' I have been thinking all this morning about it. I was thinking I might send Harvey to see about mourning for her. Harvey is very clever. She would manage it all nicely. And I might help her afterwards. Of course the best thing would be for her to go abroad, under a feigned name. I daresay I could help her, there. But at the moment 1 really do uot see what I can do.'"], [284, "DUNCAN MORAY. 276 With an oath, quite audible this time, the Admiral strode out of the room, and banged the door. But Mrs. Grierson's resources were not yet at an end. She felt serenely conscious that there was nothing, within the bounds of possibility, which she would not willingly do for poor dear Isabel Elliott ; so she ordered her carriage the next day and drove over to the Glen. Mrs. Alison declared herself to be perfectly ill with worrying and fretting over the poor darling.' 'I do not think, in all my life, I ever heard of anything half so awful. And I feel so powerless to do anything. That really makes one feel it all the more.' ' Yes, that is just what I feel.' ' But, surely, dear Mrs. Grierson, you might do something. You might at least go and see her. You have been so much more intimate with her than I ever was.' ' Well, I think that rather cuts the other way.

I understand he is out in India. It would never do to raise hopes one would be bound to disappoint. But I came over on purpose to ask you if you did not think you might go and see the poor girl ? You are so much further off, and are so comparatively little at the Glen, it would be quite different' Mrs. Alison shook her head decisively. ' My dear, consider. My acquaintance is so slight' ' Oh, but I think we should not allow that to influence us in such a case.' ' I cannot agree with you there. I really feel that for me to go there would be quite an impertinent intrusion. In times of heavy sorrow people do not care to see any but really intimate friends. Now the Millars might quite well go to her. There has always been so much intimacy between Southend and Beechwood.' ' Yes indeed, considering the way they courted her when first she came, it will be most disgraceful if they do not stand by her now. But I do not"], [286, "278 DUNCAN MORAY. believe they will. Those sort of people are always so time-serving.' ' Yes, I fear poor Miss Elliott will find their friendship is not very sincere. I am sure I would strain every nerve if I saw any means by which I could help her. Do you suppose she will be left pretty well off?' ' Oh, yes, I should think so. At least well enough off for her, poor dear, as society, of course, is quite out of the question for her now. She will be able to live on very little.' ' And much more comfortably abroad,' sugges ted Mrs. Alison. 'We might easily help her to find some nice place abroad. I could do a good deal in advising her on that point. I have been so much abroad.' ' Well, we shall see. If she is not left well off, we might help her to get a companionship, under another name. The Gillespies will be sure to know, I shall be able to hear about it from them. I am sure she will find us all most anxious to do the utmost we can for her.' ' How lucky it is for Lady Sinclair that she is"], [287, "DUNCAN MORAY. 279 abroad,' said Mrs. Alison. ' After making so much of her, as she did, what an awkward position she would have been in now, had she been at Heath field. I suppose they will stay away until they hear she has left the neighbourhood. It is really a warning to one how careful one ought to be about people, until one is very sure about them. These sort of occurrences are so very painful and distressing.' ' Yes, indeed. I cannot but feel we have all been a little to blame. Knowing that there was something not quite right in the past, with him, we should all have been more careful. It is bad blood, I am afraid. I only hope she will keep straight. Certainly I shall be very cautious about the new man.' They parted with mutual promises to do the utmost they could to aid each other in any scheme which could be devised for Isabel Elliott's benefit. But Mrs. Alison remarked to her husband, when she told him of Mrs. Grierson's visit, that she did think her rather heartless, after seeing so much of Miss Elliott, not to go near her now. And Mrs."], [288, "280 DUNCAN MORAY. Grierson, not caring to recur to the subject with her husband, confided to the faithful Harvey that she did not think Mrs. Alison's professions were very sincere, for there could really be no valid reason why she should hold aloof from poor Miss Elliott in that way. At Southend, also, there were great searchings of heart over this same topic. The terror of Mrs. Millar when she heard Henderson's portentous assertion, not knowing at the moment exactly to what extent Walter might have committed him self, is indescribable. She felt perfectly cold with fear. Her first action, on his return from Rossan, had been to cross-examine him severely, and com bat with uncompromising determination his first impulsively, generous declaration, that having made his intentions evident, he was more than ever bound now to go forward. ' The idea is ridiculous, my dear Walter ! It is perfectly out of the question. Even had you been positively engaged, it would have been amply sufficient reason for breaking off the engagement. No man can be expected to make a girl his wife"], [289, "DUNCAN MORAY. 281 whose father has only escaped a felon's doom by committing suicide.' ' It is no fault of hers,' he said, feebly. ' Quite true. But society has made laws for its own protection, and we cannot infringe them. If people with unknown antecedents of such a char acter take their place in society, they do it at their own risk, and you can no more prevent their families from suffering, if exposure comes, than you can if they are ruined by some industrial speculation. I grieve most deeply for her, but we can do nothing but just quietly let the whole thing drop.' ' Oh, mother,' exclaimed Laura Millar, with tears in her eyes, as Walter, unwilling to face further discussion of the subject, somewhat abruptly left the room. ' You will surely go and see her ? ' 'How can you be so absurd, Laura? How could I do so ? It would be just leading her to hope I meant to imply that this disaster would make no difference to your brother. Anything in the world that I could do to help her, I am sure I would, most willingly. But in the peculiar cir-"], [290, "282 DUNCAN MORAY. cumstances of our relations to her, there is no choice for us but to hold aloof. I hope Mrs. Grierson and Mrs. Alison will go and see her. For them it is quite easy. I shall think it very heart less if they do not go to her at once. I think the best thing for us to do will be to go away for a little while. That will make everything easy, and tend to prevent remarks being made, which may be painful to her, poor girl. I shall speak to your father about it' But to her husband Mrs. Millar spoke very cautiously. Walter had, she said, been a good deal cast down for some time, because he saw that he had no chance with Miss Elliott, and this sad affair had distressed him terribly. She thought a change would be desirable for him. She had not the courage to speak out all that was in her thoughts. Her own father had not been a relative to be proud of, and there had been a time when she herself had been sick with dread lest young Millar, then just starting in business in a small way, should shrink from such a connection. The sweetest music her ears had ever drunk in had"], [291, "DUNCAN MORAY. 283 been his assurance that she need have no fear that anything, save her own act and deed, could ever part them. But then they were in a very different position at that time, and in no way bound by those rules of society, according to which they must now shape their course. Still, that inter view with her lover would keep rising up in her memory, with most unpleasant vividness and fre quency, troubling her peace of mind, if it in no way interfered with her resolution. Helen Millar alone of the family was sternly and serenely inexorable. Laura cried herself to sleep many a night, thinking of poor Isabel in her loneli ness and desolation, yet vaguely conscious, all the time, that were the restraint which prevented her from taking any action removed, she was by no means certain she would have the courage to set society at defiance on her own account. And poor Walter wandered about dejected and listless. He did not in the least believe Isabel would have him, if he went and asked her ; but he called him self a pitiful cur for not going at least to show her that he was ready to stand by her side, and defy"], [292, "284 DUNCAN MORAY. society and all its rules for her dear sake. And loathing his own weakness and inability to shake himself free from the degradiug influence of the family aspirations, he could only wonder, with a sense of shame and humiliation, if Miss Elliott ever gave a thought to their conversation on the lake, little more than a year ago. Mrs. Fordyce was no less clear and resolute as to her duty as a minister's wife, and a mother. ' We are bound,' she said, ' to protest by our actions against evil in any shape. Of course we must all feel most deeply for Miss Elliott, and Mr. Fordyce would gladly pay her pastoral visits in her sad trouble, did we uot know very well that they would not be received. She was never, at the best of times, a very regular church goer ; and though it is not for us to judge, I cannot say I think she is a person likely, in time of trouble, to find much consolation in religion. As for myself, whatever I might do, I have daughters whom I must consider. For their sakes any sort of association must be avoided. In fact I may safely say that, in the past, any overtures towards"], [293, "DUNCAN MORAY. 285 friendliness from the manse have been received with a coldness which leaves us now no other course but to avoid all direct action. My heart bleeds for the poor girl, but she is certainly very proud. Au all wise Providence has doubtless decreed for her this fearful disgrace, as the chastening discipline best calculated to lessen that terrible failing. I can only pray that it may be abundantly blessed to her.' And thus did the discreditable episodes of Mr. Elliott's early life not only bring down ruin upon his head, but also cause much worry and annoy ance to various highly respectable members of society, all serenely conscious that they had a right to feel themselves ill used in being thus forced to suffer iuconvenience for no further fault of their own than a too good-natured leniency, leading them to neglect the duty of making searching investigation into the immaculate spotlessness of the lives of those whom they ad mitted to intimate association with themselves."], [294, "DUNCAN MORAY. 286 CHAPTER XIII. THE DARKEST HOUR AND THE DA WN. TTOW far infringements of strict legal procedure were winked at ; how far the chivalry of the press, never wanting in such a case, save in the most debased portions thereof, was appealed to on her behalf, Isabel Elliott never knew. All that she knew was that such letters as reached her, from acquaintances in England, spoke only of their regret and amazement at seeing the sudden death of Mr. Elliott announced in the papers. Some even accentuated their ignorance by expressing a hope the shock to her had been broken by some slight premonitory symptoms of danger. Her repose, at least, was unbroken by any outward reminders that she was utterly alone in the world, in a different sense from the loneliness brought upon a woman in her position by the death of her only near relative."], [295, "DUNCAN MORAY. 287 The fatal meeting had been held on a Thursday evening, and they merely told her the funeral would take place on Monday, in what manner conducted she did not ask. But on the Friday evening after Mr. Dempster's visit, she sent again for Mr. Gillespie, and requested that all the servants engaged might be paid off, and sent away the next day. ' There is no reason against such an arrange ment, I suppose?' she said. ' None, mem, if ye wish it.' ' I do wish it very much. I shall feel much happier here alone with just those who were lure when I first came.' Then she sent for Mrs. Campbell to come aud see her, thanked her quietly for coming, and asked her to spend as much time every day as she could at Beechwood for the present. ' You are one of the few people I do not shrink from seeing,' she said, not adding the reason, her own perception of which was in truth hardly clear, and which, had it been, she would scarcely have cared to give. In her overstrung condition she"], [296, "288 DUNCAN MORAY. was acutely sensitive to the unexpressed senti ments of those around her, and was as instantly soothed by the large-hearted tenderness which only mourned and sympathized, as she was repelled and pained by the sympathy which did not lose sight of moral ends, and the solemn warn ing conveyed by such striking vindications of divine justice. Mrs. Campbell wept freely in the kitchen after her interview, and went home denouncing all ladies more bitterly than ever. ' It's a fair heartbreak, John,' she said, ' to see the puir thing sitting sae quiet, wi' oh ! sic a look on her face, an' a sort o' patient dignity about her, that I could nae venture to say a word, though my heart was that full I could scarce keep frae sabbing outright.

Everybody's saying : \" Wait till Leddy Sinclair comes.\" ' 'Why doesna the woman come then ?' ejaculated Mrs. Campbell impatiently. ' She's nae had time. Gillespie says when she does come we shall know how quick it's possible for a woman to travel.' Mr. Gillespie, going up to the house on Saturday morning, met Dr. Fleming coming down the drive, and auxiously asked for his report. ' I can but say, as I said before, I do not like her condition, but I cannot say there are any distinctly unfavourable symptoms; and her natural kind thoughtfulness for others seems to be stand ing her in good stead. She tries to take the things Mrs. Boswell prepares for her for fear of disappointing her, so that I think she is getting a fair amount of nourishment' ' We're thinkiug to close the coffin the uicht,' Mr. Gillespie said.

It might be the means 2 T"], [298, "290 DUNCAN MORAY. of breaking down this rigid composure, the thing of all others I should most like to see happen.' Not without trepidation Mr. Gillespie did as he was bidden, and caught, as deftly as he had done before, the meaning of the momentary convulsive twitching of her face caused by his words. ' There's naething to distress ye, Miss Elliott. He looks sae calm an' peacefu', ye might think he was sleeping.' ' Then I should like to see him. I will come now.' She rose as she spoke but sbe grew very white, and her step, as she crossed the hall, was heavy and languid. Mr. Gillespie opened the library door and stood back to allow her to pass, but she laid a hand, which he felt trembled, on his arm as if she needed support, and so compelled him to advance to the side of the coffin with her. Very calm and peaceful the dead man looked, without the faintest sign of how he came by his end, for it had not been difficult to couceal the one small discoloured spot upon the temple. His daughter stood silently contemplating him for a"], [299, "DUNCAN MORAY. 291 few moments. She still rested her hand on the factor's arm, but it did not seem to him as if she was conscious of his presence. ' Poor father ! poor father !

Mother was taken away from the evil to come.' Then she bent down and kissed him, and turning, walked away with her stern composure still unmoved ; and Mr. Gillespie could only re-echo the oft-repeated aspiration : ' If only Lady Sinclair would come.' If only she would come ! When the funeral was over there seemed to be nothing to do but wait and hope every hour that she might appear, and with her strong clear sense and firm will take the decisive action which everyone felt was daily more urgently needed, and no one had the right to initiate. Isabel Elliott's composure remained quite unshaken. If she had ever shed a tear, since the blow fell upon her, no one had seen any sigu of it."], [300, "292 DUNCAN MORAY. Yet they were all more or less in error respecting her condition. There was in it less of stunned apathy, more of stern heroism than they imagined. That stern necessity of her character, under all circumstances boldly to face truth, whether of fact or opinion, had never asserted itself more vigor ously than at the present moment. The absolute bewilderment caused to her by the startling scene in the hall had been of very brief duration. Even before she reached her home, her mind, guided by a circumstance known only to herself, had seized upon Henderson's assertion, and worked with remorseless energy along the terrible track on which the light of truth shone all too clearly. Her own impression had always been that, as a child, she had heard some story of the Carfrae who was in her father's service at Oxford, being killed there by some accident. Since she had heard her father's explanation to the Procurator- Fiscal, she had often wondered how the mistake had arisen ? but had always forborne to ask him any question which must turn his attention to a painful subject, Final and absolute conviction of"], [301, "DUNCAN MORAY. 293 the whole horrible truth had come, when Dr. Fleming's silence had assured her that her un happy father had died by his own hand, rather than face his accuser. From that moment her thoughts had dwelt unceasingly on all the incidents of the past year. Every word her father had spoken, every trifling circumstance which, at the time of its occurrence, had seemed strange to her \u2014 all now found full and cruel explanation. She seemed to be perpetually living again through the scenes of that terrible night, shuddering at the perfect skill with which he played his part, even to appearing perfectly unmoved by her remarks on murder, at the very moment when his own victim was lying not a quarter of a mile away; and able to recall nothing save his evidently shaken nerves, and his clinging attitude towards herself, as evidence that his whole nature was not hardened into absolute callousness. And it was he, her own father, who had not only brought down upon her sorrow and disgrace such as the wildest imagination could hardly have pictured, but, in the very act, had robbed"], [302, "DUNCAN MORAY. 294 her for ever of the only source of strength and consolation which such a catastrophe could have left to her. There was no father's love awaiting her at Craignellan, because her own father's cruel hand had laid the noble tender heart cold and silent in the quiet churchyard. And all which, on the very brink of the grave, that love had sought to achieve for her, was frustrated, because the cold shade of a murdered father must for ever stand between the son who loved him so dearly, and the daughter of the murderer. No thought of carrying out her promise ever crossed her mind. She could only be thankful that Duncan Moray was far away ; that there was no danger of their ever meeting again. And the future? She need not for the moment face that dark mystery ; but she very clearly understood the significance, with regard to it, of the present. She did not feel her utter loneliness less keenly because a certain sentiment of lofty disdain marked her attitude towards the troop of summer friends who had vanished at the first mutterings of the storm. She could have foretold"], [303, "DUNCAN MORAY. 295 it all, could even have foretold that the man who professed to love her would not have the courage to stand by her through such a disaster. The old acquaintances who had written, had written in ignorance. She would hear little of them should a hint of the truth reach them. Save Lady Sinclair she had not a friend in the world, among the class in which her lot had been cast. And of her she thought with almost as much distress as confidence. It would not be very long before she would be with her, and she knew the instant suggestion which would follow ; and against that she was firmly bent. The loving sympathy of the true-hearted woman she would thankfully accept, but she would never embarrass the woman of society with the presence, in her house, of the daughter of a murderer and a suicide. It was a hard lot to be doomed, at four and twenty years of age, to a lonely life, under the shadow of a great crime ; but she was too proud to falter, \u2014 too generous to allow a friend to suffer with her.

The outward preservation of cold composure while the inward grasp of a position full of cruel pain and abiding gloom was so vivid and comprehensive, could not but cause a tension which must inevitably, sooner or later, prove too great a strain on her sorely tried strength. That she was growing thinner almost daily was patent to all who saw her, but there was none to help, and the faithful retainers could but watch and wait. ' Hasten on a' business matters as fast as ye can,' Mr. Gillespie said to Mr. Dempster. 'Onything that '11 rouse her to action will be better than this sitting doing naething.' Thus the time passed until Thursday had come again. She took note of the day herself, sitting wearily by the drawing-room window, looking out into the bright sunshine. Could it be that only"], [305, "DUNCAN MORAY. 297 that day week she had been flitting in and out of the house, arranging flowers, and exchanging laughing remarks with him who now lay sleeping unmourned in his dishonoured grave, while she superintended all the preparations for the dinner which had been so blithe and joyous ? It rather seemed as if it must be years since any sound of mirth had been heard in that sombre old house ; as if years must pass before ever again the tragic gloom, which seemed to pervade every corner of it, would pass away. Suddenly, as she thus sat sadly musing, her ear caught a sound which seemed to drive every drop of blood back to her heart, and she rose from her chair, clenching her thin hands together in an almost convulsive clasp. The door at the end of the passage leading to the drawing-room from the hall had opened and closed, and a footstep came hastily along the passage \u2014 a footstep that she knew. The drawing-room door opened, and Duncan Moray stood before her. She remained fixed in her place, gazing at him with dilated eyes, and a low sound between a sigh"], [306, "DUNCAN MORAY. 298 and a moan escaped from her parched, quivering lips. He closed the door, and came slowly, almost hesitatingly, towards her. About the doorway the shadow was deep ; but as he advanced, and paused in the full light from the window, she saw more clearly the expression of his face. The measured progression of articulate sounds falling upon the ear is no fitting medium of com munication between spirit and spirit, in those transcendent moments when emotional excitement is strained to the point of deadest stillness, so it is ever then that the eyes, with their wonderful power of gathering whole realms of space into one minute fragment of time, assert their almost illimitable power, and flash a revelation, embracing it may be the fulness of a life-time, in one single instant, into the soul Only for some such brief interval did the son of the murdered and the daughter of the murderer read the history of the past, and the hope of the future, in each other's eyes.

' My poor wee darling,' he murmured in a low tone, vibrating with intense feeling. ' To think this should come on ye, an' I far away.

But he would not let her go. ' Dear,' he said, ' I know all ye could tell me. I have known it all, from the first moment' ' Known ! ' \u2014 her voice failed her.

But the tension had relaxed ; the re-action had come ; the ice bound winter desolation of forsaken loneliness had given way before the fight and warmth of love and hope, and the tumult and up heaval were too much for her sorely taxed strength. He saw that she was swaying, and catching her in his arms, he laid her unconscious on the couch, and rang the bell. He had arrived the previous night, having been away from home for a day, and thus not received his cousin's letter until twenty-four hours later than was expected. His course of action had been arranged with the Campbells, after hearing that the doctor had said they had better try any possible thing which might break down her unnatural calmness. Mrs. Campbell, bewildered at the thought of Duncan, of all people, inter vening, had been sent on to prepare Marion Boswell for his coming. They were both at hand, and hastily answered his summons. Marion bent for a moment over the swollen, tear stained face"], [313, "DUNCAN MORAY. 305 of the unconscious girl, and then turned to Duncan with tears running down her face. ' Duncan Moray,' she said, ' ye've saved her life! ' 'Show me the way,' was his quiet response, ' an' I'll carry her upstairs for ye.' 'Gang dour, an' send Peter for the doctor,' Marion whispered, as he laid her gently on a couch in her room. ' An' ye'se best bide yersel'. I doubt he'll may be like to see ye.' Duncan Moray accordingly made his way back to the drawing-room, and sat down to await Dr. Fleming, with a gladness in his heart to which it had long been a stranger. That most things come to those who wait for them, had been an essential feature of his creed. But never, surely, had so strange a coming ended so apparently hopeless a waiting? He was very quiet and com posed, inconceivably so it had seemed to the Campbells, unaware that what fell like the crash of a thunderbolt on every one else, was, to him, but the lifting of a dark heavy cloud whi.^h had hung like an oppressive pall upon his life.

Of Isabel Elliott's sad condition, so far as any fears for the future were concerned, he made but light. He did not credit his queen with being of quite such gossamer make as to be so lightly shattered. His heart ached over her present sorrow, but without any gloomy forebodings. Moreover, her own words \u2014 ' It was the thought of your coming to know that was killing me ' \u2014 had contained, for him, a considerable amount of revelation ; and he was vaingloriously certain he had administered a medicine far more potent than any which the doctor could suggest. And if he owed his present position more to the fact of his being his father's son, than to any particular merits of his own, he was very well content to accept the situation, serenely satisfied of his own ability speedily to fortify that position impregnably, out of the material of his own personal characteristics, now that he had won the right to manifest what"], [315, "DUNCAN MORAY. 307 special form they took towards the woman he lovod. Therefore, though his manner was grave and subdued, as befitted the sadness of the surround ing circumstances, it was with a very self possessed air that he turned towards the door to meet Dr. Fleming, when he heard footsteps approaching, prepared to give him a judiciously excised account of his meeting with Miss Elliott. The door opened and Lady Sinclair entered. She had landed in England the previous day, and sending on a telegram to Mr. Gillespie to meet her that morning, early, at Heathfield, had travelled all night, heard the whole sad story from him, and only waiting to change her travel soiled clothing, had started at once for Beechwood. Her amazement at the sight of Duncan Moray was evident. ' You here ? ' was her abrupt greeting. ' Where else would ye expect me to be at such a time, but at Isabel's side?' he composedly replied. ' Isabel ! ' Then clasping her hands with a"], [316, "DUNCAN MORAY. 308 sudden gesture of terror, she came hastily towards him. ' Oh, my God,' she exclaimed, ' you do not, you cannot know all. Oh, this is too dreadful ! ' ' If ye're thinking I do not know that it was the laird murdered my father, I've known that a' the time ? ' ' You have known it? ' ' Of course I have.

Dr. Fleming made sundry notes, for future use, on the action of a shock, pure and simple, as a means of arousing from apathetic composure a person suffering from the stunning effect of a severe mental blow. Probably he came subsequently to feel that the most valuable lesson he had learned was that of the importance of being very certain of your premises before you draw your conclusion. Duncan Moray spent much of his time at Beechwood, where Lady Sinclair had taken up her residence, but of that interesting fact Rossan remained in most heart-rending ignorance, as the pathway down into the valley from Craignellan was not only beyond the range of its vigilance,"], [319, "DUNCAN MORAY. 311 but also led to a number of different places. Beechwood was, in truth, altogether an unsatis factory subject, for Mrs. Campbell, who was sharing the task of nursing the sufferer with Lady Sinclair and Marion Boswell, was as impenetrable as were the faithful retainers in the house. Nothing beyond daily bulletins respecting Miss Elliott's illness could be secured on any terms. ' I cannot tell you what a weight you have lifted off me,' Lady Sinclair said to Duncan Moray one day, as they went strolling up the glen together. 'How? ' By settling the question of Isabel's future. I do not believe anything Sir Robert and I could have said would have induced her to make Heath field her home ; and it was such a dreary prospect' ' Would ye have been as well pleased if things had no gone wrong wi' her ?

Under any circumstances she would have been happier with you.' It was a wan white sceptre, an almost painfully light burden for his strong arms, that at last, after several weeks, Duncan Moray carried down stairs, and laid on a couch in the drawing-room. But the rallying point once reached, her progress was rapid ; and whatever storms of coarse textured kindliness or caudid friendship might rage with out, there were no worries or vexations within to fret her weakened powers, and retard her con valescence. Mr. Dempster had received a letter from Major Elliott, written with manly soldier-like"], [321, "DUNCAN MORAY. 313 frankness. He could hardly, he said, venture, under such painful circumstances, to intrude him self, even by letter, on a cousin who was a perfect stranger to him ; but his orders were clear and prompt. ' For as long as she has the least wish to remain at Beechwood, see that au establishment, in all respects suited for her position, is kept up for her ; and on every point connected with the property let her least wish be law.' ' Uncommonly handsome, is it not ? ' Mr. Dempster said, wheu he showed the letter to Mr. Gillespie. ' Ay. It's a' that. Had I no ken't the Major is a gude bit aulder than Miss Elliott, I wad hae said he maun be her twin brither. It looks like as they'd been turned oot o' the same mould.' ' He is very kind,' Isabel said, wheu Mr. Dempster gave her the letter, at their first inter view. ' But I have no wish, save to leave Beech wood as soon as possible. Lady Sinclair will write and thank him for me.' Isabel had, however, one wish, which was brought by her cousin's letter within the range of"], [322, "DUNCAN MORAY. 314 possibility; but it was not one she chose to confide to Mr. Dempster. Duncan Moray, supposed to be instructed by Lady Sinclair, went down the next day to the Carse. ' Ye've seen the Major's letter, Gillespie ? ' ' Ay, an' weel pleased I was. It's a pity he's married, Moray.' ' That's as may be. I don't know o' any reason to regret it. But what I wanted to tell ye is this? Miss Elliott has set her heart on having the tree he hid behind that night cut down. Could ye no manage it at once ? Leddy Sinclair's thinking to take her for a drive soon. It would be weel if the tree was away before then.' ' It shall be awa', root aud branch, in eight an' forty hours,' replied the factor energetically. Duncan carried back the answer, and she thanked him with a smile. He took his own way with her, encouraging her to speak as much as she liked of the past. ' It's better to speak than to brood, dear,' he said. ' An' ye know there isn't a hard thought left wi' me the now.' ' I know that. You have no need to tell me."], [323, "DUNCAN MORAY. 315 One feels the difference in a moment. Poor father ! If you sat there and condescended from the heights of your superior morality to judge him leniently, I could not have spoken of him to you. Now you have another thing to do for me.' 'What is that?'

You must look through them. 1 dreaded so much the thought of having to do it I leave it all to you. I shall not even ask you what you find.' The task, however, was an easy one. Whatever Mr. Elliott's life had been, he had taken care it should leave no records behind, so far as his possessions went. After little more than au hour's work Duncan Moray was able to report that there was nothing in the cabinet but what it would be well Mr. Dempster should look over, and either burn or set aside as he thought best. Of one discovery, however, he did not tell her. Carefully examining an old memorandum-book he had observed that it had a small pocket. In that"], [324, "DUNCAN MORAY. 316 pocket, apparently utterly forgotten, lay a yellow faded slip of newspaper. It contained a brief account of a coroner's inquest, held at Oxford, respecting the death of James Carfrae, servant to Mr. Gerald Elliott of College, who had been accidentally killed in consequence of a horse that he was riding running away with him. Duncan Moray discreetly committed that paper to the flames. The same fate befell one letter which arrived for Isabel ; but in that nefarious deed he had Lady Sinclair for an accomplice. In one of their long talks Isabel had told him of the reputed cause of the apocryphal Vienna expedition, believing her self that some difficulty which her father had been able to settle by writing, had suggested to him a method of making, unsuspected, the investigations which were imperatively necessary. Shortly after Duncan observed, among letters awaiting Isabel, one bearing the Vienna post-mark. He forthwith carried it to Lady Sinclair and stated his fears. ' Open it,' she promptly advised. Duncan did so. The letter was signed 'Eric"], [325, "DUNCAN MORAY. 317 Rawlinson,' and was a hearty assurance to his cousin Isabel of his grief and sympathy, and that, for him, the only possible remembrance of the dead must ever be of the man who had stood by him when his own follies might have ruined him, and to whom he was solely indebted for the comfortable position in which he found himself. 'What will we do?' Duncan said. 'It might be a consolation to her to know he had saved one that got into trouble.' ' And had not hesitated to blast his good name when it suited his purpose ! Put the letter in the fire.' Duncan obeyed, and Lady Sinclair undertook to write a diplomatic answer. That very day, when sitting beside Isabel's couch, he told her that if she continued to make as good progress as she had hitherto done, Dr. Fleming said she might be moved to Heathfield in the course of another week. 'Then I'll no be able to see ye every day,' lie said, 'so now ye [must give me the answer to the question I asked ye.'"], [326, "DUNCAN MORAY. 318 ' What question ? ' ' Do ye no mind the question I asked ye the day I came \u2014 the last question ? ' ' I don't remember very much of what you did say just at the last. Eveiything seemed to be whirling.'

Do you know that if I went into a London ballroom at this moment, there would not be a man there who, if he knew, would even dance with me?' ' I know uaught o' their ways,' he replied simply, ' an' truth to tell, by the looks o' the most o' them that I've seen, I've no great wish to know.

She laid her hand in his, and murmured. ' God do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.' Had Isabel Elliott but known it, there had been a very terrible talk already. The appalling truth wholly transcended the wildest conjecture of the most prolific brain in Rossan. Of course Duncan Moray had come, thinking his father's murderer was going to be brought to justice ; and that he should have seen Miss Elliott, and called since to inquire for her, was nothing but right, just to show that he did not hold her anyway to blame. But what kept him hanging on at Craignellan just at such a time ? It showed great callousness of feeling, and much disrespect for his father's memory. Mrs. Fordyce, by dint of direct and persistent questioning, had elicited from Joan 2 W"], [330, "DUNCAN MORAY. 322 Clark the admission that he had not allowed the flowers sent from the manse to be used in any way in connection with his father's funeral, and since then she had been, more than ever before, both leader and mouthpiece of uncomplimentary opinion respecting him. She waxed quite excited in discussing his enormities at a neighbouring manse, boiling over even into more diffusive scandal. ' I had never a high opinion of Duncan Moray, and I confess his conduct since the death of his father has seemed to me very inconsistent with his high sounding professions of affection. But this is beyond anything I could have believed.' ' Perhaps business detains him,' suggested Mrs. Blair, rather vaguely. ' Business ! no doubt ; but of what kind ? The business of paying court to the daughter of his father's murderer, just at the moment when any right feeling man would have shrunk with horror from the thought of coming near the place.

I do assuie you, my dear Mrs. Blair, were he in a position to venture on the attempt, I believe he would be quite capable of trying to induce that girl to marry him, in order that he might secure the land for nothing.' ' Oh, no, my dear Mrs. Fordyce!' exclaimed the outraged listener. \" Impossible ! Indeed, indeed, you go too far. Such a marriage would be an outrage on common decency.' Mr. Dempster was informed, on the occasion of his next visit, that Miss Elliott was to accompany"], [332, "324 DUNCAN MORAY. Lady Sinclair to Heathfield in a few days. He looked somewhat grave.

But if I may venture to make a suggestion, Major Elliott has showu a very friendly spirit. Would it not be fair to give him the chance of buying in such things as you do not need ? And then, there are the family portraits.' Isabel looked at him with a puzzled expression. ' 1 do not quite understand what you mean,' she said. ' Perhaps you do not quite understand about the entail. All that Major Elliott is entitled to, as heir of entail, is the land and the bare walls of the house. Everything else is absolutely yours.'

He would doubtless be glad to buy them in.' A glance of withering couteiupt rewarded him, which was hard upon the poor man, for he was only doing his duty. ' I do not wish utterly to despise myself,' she replied haughtily. ' Of course I do not understand what may be legally required ; but let whatever steps are necessary be at once taken to hand over to my cousin everything, save the furniture we brought from London, and the carriages and horses.' Throughout all this time Isabel had never, in talking to Lady Sinclair, made any direct allusion to her own relations to Duncan Moray. Externally"], [334, "326 DUNCAN MORA Y. all her habitual composed serenity of manner was restored to her, but she was very well aware that it was, as yet, but a very superficial deposit, and that she would do well to avoid carefully all sub jects which were in the least agitating or exciting. Lady Sinclair, divining with ready tact the exact nature of the situation, had accepted the position as though it were the most natural thing in the world, and hazarded no remark upon it, discreetly entrusting to Duncan himself the charge of auy communications likely to be in the least of an agitating nature. After a few quiet dayTs at Heathfield, however, the subject, one day, came up easily and naturally of itself. Lady Sinclair proposed a drive in the direction of Southeud. ' Are the Millars at home ? ' Isabel asked. ' Oh, no. The house is shut up. They are gone abroad for some months. Really, Isabel, I was sorry for him aud Laura.

' He might have saved his honour without paying the price then,' replied Miss Elliott, with a ring of scorn in her voice, ' and he must have known that. He must have known perfectly well that I should not accept him.' ' Perhaps he thought you might have changed your mind. But had you really come to that determination ? I thought, when I went away, he had a chance.' A sudden flash lightened up the saddened gravity which was, for the time, the habitual expression of Isabel's face, as she replied : ' 1 believe he had, until I chanced to see a post script to a letter, not meant for my eyes, and which revealed to me a good deal more than was actually therein written in words.

He has been stronger and better this last six months than 1 have known him for years. I could not have hoped Mr. Moray would wait for me on the chance.' ' Do you think it is a very rash step ?

But for you dear Isabel, even with the shadow of the sad past upon you, I hold you blessed above all women of my acquaintance.'

There are people to, and with, whom the seventh heaven of the Apostolic vision would hardly prove an enjoyable abode. But all connection with the sceue of that tragic chapter of life's history was not broken off, and the opinion which sprang up and flourished in the Corran valley was, that it was a bonnie wee place the Morays had got, and they were that happy, it seemed like as it was aye sunshine there. It was in rather a startled tone that Mrs. Moray, looking up one morning from a letter she was reading, said to her husband : ' Duncan, Lady Sinclair says she is coming to spend a few days with us.'"], [338, "330 DUNCAN MORAY.

Mrs. Moray's eyes brightened with a slight sus picion of tears, as she looked up in her husband's face. ' Things are well with her now,' she said, ' but she has never known the bliss of a really, happy, married life. I think she runs the risk of going away with an intensified sense of an aching void.' ' If a risk of comparisons which are no just"], [339, "DUNCAN MORAY. 331 exactly favourable is never to be run,' Duncan quietly replied, ' I doubt there's no a great many married people had better come here.' The risk in Lady Sinclair's case was run, with what results was only to be conjectured from the fact that she outstayed considerably the intended limit of her visit. One day, when she had been describing to the Morays some specially magnificent scenes in which she had lately been an actor, Isabel openly ex pressed her sentiments. ' How in the world can you manage to content yourself with our simple homely ways, accustomed as you are to such a gorgeous luxurious sort of existence ? ' They were all sitting on the lawn before the house, from whence there was a magnificeut view over a wide expanse of beautiful sceuery, at that moment bathed in all the glowing splendour of a brilliant sunset.

' But 1 cannot watch it out of the same moral atmosphere, and so the sensations that harmonize with it are wanting. If you could watch a sun set like yonder one from the midst of a crowded theatre, you would feel as much inclined to cover jTour eyes, as a hideous discord inclines you to stop your ears.'

You ought to grant the request'"], [342, "334 DUNCAN MORAY. Here Duncan Moray, who had been quietly watching his wife's face while Lady Sinclair spoke, intervened with a slightly authoritative accent. ' There's only one way that can be done.

' She'll no say anything to Isabel?' ' Oh, dear no ! No fear. Her tact is unfailing' The Elliotts' visit was accordingly paid, and before they left, Duncan Moray, to his own great surprise, found himself pledged to go and shoot at Beechwood. One evening, when he and Major Elliott chanced to be alone together, his guest said carelessly \u2014 ' 1 shall count upon your coming to shoot with me this autumn, Moray.' ' No thank you, Major Elliott,' he replied. ' It's very kind o' ye to ask it, but I'd rather not. I'm no used to the ways o' houses like yours, an' I doubt I'd feel ill at ease.' ' My dear fellow, you would do nothing of the kind. You may depend that neither Alice nor I entangle ourselves in the meshes of pomp and ceremony. We are both far too fond of liberty.

' Well, to tell the truth, I believe I am rather superstitious. At any rate, whether or no it may be that prophecies have a tendency to bring about their own fulfilment, I have certainly known some strange instances of evil seeming to cling about places said to be under a curse. When I think of all the ill which connection with the Elliotts has brought upon your family, I can't help feeling as if there must be a curse upon the place. I want you, the last victim, to come as a sort of high priest, to make an atonement. I think if you had once visited me there, as a kinsman and most welcome guest, I should feel as if the curse was lifted off.' ' That's a strange notion. ' A strange superstition, perhaps you feel more inclined to say. Well, that is just how I feel, so if you will come you will lay me under a lasting obligation.' ' It's no possible to refuse if ye put it that way, 2 x"], [346, "DUNCAN MORAY. 338 Major. But ye must no talk of an atonement. The day that gave me my wife far more than atoned for the worst the Elliotts did, or could have done, to me an' mine.' 'Well, we will say then you come to bum incense to drive out the evil spirits. Only come. I know Alice must not ask Isabel at present, though I hope it may be only at present, and I know Lady Sinclair counts upon a visit from her when you come to us.' So the Elliotts went home in triumph, for Lady Sinclair had made a bet with Mrs. Elliott that they would not induce Duncan Moray to visit them. ' I knew Fred would carry his point,' she said. ' He always manages to get his own way, and he was more than ever bent on establishing an intimacy after he saw Mr. Moray. He says he is just what his high-toned, generous dealings about Craignellan led him to anticipate. And, oh Lady Sinclair, what a charm there is about the place !

' Did he tell you so ? He is not generally so communicative.' ' He told me so unceasingly, from the moment I arrived until the moment I left, though never in words. His eyes follow her every movement, and the very tone of his voice changes when he speaks to her. Yet, it is very curious. There is no doubt she is still, for him, to some extent, Miss Elliott of Beechwood. There is a certain deference in his devotion, though he can assert himself, too. There was some slight accident in the stable one evening. She was for following him out. The tone in which he told her to go back was unmistakable. Aud she fully returns his devotion. It is altogether the most exquisite romance I ever came across. All they have both suffered was amply repaid to each the day they became husband and wife.' Some years after the Beechwood tragedy Major Elliott appeared pne day, quite unexpectedly, at the Morays' house. ' I am come to pay a morning visit,' he said, 'and as I can hardly get back to-day,"], [348, "DUNCAN MORAY. 340 I want you to give me a bed. I have brought you and Moray a present, Isabel.' He placed a carefully sealed packet in her hands, which she laughingly raised to her ear. ' It does not tick ? ' she said. ' Oh no, it is quite harmless. Open it. She obeyed, and as she unfolded the wrapper, and caught sight of the contents of the parcel, she exclaimed with a gasp \u2014 ' Oh Fred !' Within the parcel lay a packet of old, worn, discoloured papers, tied together with a piece of faded tape. Without replying, Major Elliott drew from the packet the paper lying on the top, and opening it, held it up before his cousin's eyes. The ink of a century ago was not as the ink of to-day. The writing on the yellow paper was quite distinct. It was a formal receipt, from Charles Elliott to David Moray, for the purchase money of the piece of land known as the Rig Mains. Isabel fell back in her chair, and looked in a half-dazed way alternately at her husband and cousin."], [349, "DUNCAN MORAY. 341 'Where did you find them?' she asked, at length. ' Ah. That is the strangest part of the business. I would give you a thousand guesses, and lay heavy odds on your never coming near the truth. They were at Craignellan all the time.' ' How ? ' exclaimed Duncan Moray, starting up. ' Ay, my dear fellow, they were. Through all the years of your grandfather's and father's lives they were there, lying close to your hand, too.' ' But where ? How were they found ? ' ' Well, in brief, it happened thus. My tenant at Craignellan was anxious to have some altera tions made, which interfered somewhat with the entrance to the kitchen, so we determined to close the present one, and break a door through where the cupboard in the wall was. When they came to pull down the wood work, which had been most clumsily fitted in, there turned out to be a sort of ledge above the door. The cupboard had evidently been made after the house was built ; the wall had been very roughly broken away, and never finished off again after the wood work was"], [350, "DUNCAN MORAY. 342 fitted in, and thus this ledge had been left. On it this packet of papers was lying. At any moment, a man of your height, standing in the cupboard doorway, and feeling along above it, could have put his hand upon them.' Duncan Moray buried his face in his hands. He seemed utterly bewildered. ' How can they have come there ? ' Isabel queried. ' That we shall never know for certain,' Major Elliott answered ; ' but I do not think it is very difficult to construct a story which is probably very near the truth. My theory is that the old man was really asked to take the papers to Beech wood, but without any nefarious design, and that there he did get very drunk. Nothing would then be more probable than that the one idea of the value of the papers held its place in his mind, as one idea will often take a tenacious hold on the mind of a drunken man, and that he hid them himself, and by the morning had forgotten all about having done so. The suspicion that he had been robbed of them was natural enough, and if"], [351, "DUNCAN MORAY. 343 his rage so far conquered his astuteness that he allowed Colonel Elliott to find out that he had lost them, I do not think our worthy kinsman would have been the least likely to be long in turning that discovery to his own account. Of course this is all pure hypothesis, but, unless the old man was a sleep walker, it seems to me to be the only possible explanation of this mysterious discovery. What do you say, Moray ? ' Duncan Moray raised his head and shook it. ' Dinna ye ask me, man,' he said, lapsing in his bewilderment into broad Scotch. ' Ye've fair knockit the heid aff me.' ' What are all these other papers ? ' Isabel asked. ' Title deeds, and various papers bearing on the sale. It is verily a strange story.' ' Ye may say that,' Duncan Moray replied. ' I cannot grasp it. Ye seem to have turned my whole life wrong side up. To think o' a' the heart burning, an' bitterness, au' questionings there have beeu over this matter ; my grandfather fretting an' wearing his life out about it ; au' my father an' I, from the time I can mind anything,"], [352, "344 DUNCAN MORAY. often talking, an' wondering how the truth might really be. An' these papers lying, as ye say, just at our very hand a' the time. Thank God ! I've no cause to think o' my poor father's life as being anyway embittered or saddened about it, save for his grieving about his father.' ' Did no suspicion of the possibility of the old man having lost the papers ever cross your mind ? ' Isabel asked. ' Never for a moment ; an' that's just what makes the thing so bewildering. We'd aye held that the only thing quite certain was that there'd been some sort o' a transaction about the papers that wouldn't bear the light. An' now it turns out that is just the one point about which we were utterly at fault. It gives one a sort o' -a feeling as if one had been walking two ways at once all one's life.' ' Just think, if I hadn't married you, Duncan ! Epimenedes and the Cretans would have been nothing to the tangle. The land was yours, not mine, but I sold it to Fred. But then Fred gave you more for Craignellan than he would have"], [353, "DUNCAN MORAY. 345 done if the Rig Mains had not gone with it, and he gave me more for the Rig Mains than he would have done had you not sold him Craignellan at the same time. And the transaction could not have been managed otherwise than it was, until this moment, when I should have been far away with the price of the Rig Mains. And a whole flock of lawyers would have rushed in, and raised a host of quibbles. And ' Good Heavens, Isabel! ' exclaimed Major Elliott, ' spare the unhappy man ! You'll have to tele graph for ice to put on his head directly, if you do not mind. I fear there is no possibility of your instituting an interminable law suit over the business, and bringing both yourselves and me to hopeless ruin, so the only thoroughly dramatic conclusion I can see to the story, would be for you and Moray to wreck your domestic happiness by a furious and unappeasable quarrel over the proper division of the amount of the purchase money for the whole property.' Duncan Moray looked at his wife for a moment"], [354, "DUNCAN MORAY. 346 with a calmly critical air, and then he replied composedly \u2014 ' I'll no take up that business just at present. She's still too handsome. I'll wait till she begins to grow old and ugly.' THE END."], [355, ""], [356, ""], [357, ""], [358, ""], [359, ""], [360, ""]]
