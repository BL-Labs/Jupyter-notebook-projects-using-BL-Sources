LISBON, MADEIRA & TENERIFE. For the information of intending visitors to Lisbon, Madeira and Tenerife, the following is given :\u2014 LISBON. Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, is the most western city of Europe, and for beauty of situation, as approached from the sea, is said to be only equalled by Naples and Constantinople. The Union Company's Steamers anchor abreast ofthe \"Terreiro do Pago,\" one ofthe largest and handsomest squares in Europe. The average temperature at Lisbon during winter is 520 Fahr. ; and in summer, 700 Fahr. Snow and frost are almost unknown, and the place affords a delightful winter or spring resort for those who shun the cold English east winds. Lisbon boasts of having one of the largest and handsomest English Churches on the Continent, where service is conducted by the resident minister, the Revd. Canon Pope. Cintra, of far-famed and unrivalled beauty, is connected with Lisbon by rail. It is situated on the acclivity of a mountain range, sixteen miles north-west of Lisbon. The nature and profuseness of the vegetation, the rocky heights and the wooded dells, render Cintra a charming summer retreat for the healthy and the sick; but it is hardly suitable for invalids in winter, being then too humid and foggy. The best Hotels in Lisbon are the Braganza, Central, and Durand's, at all of which English is spoken. Charges from 8s. to 10s. per day. At Cintra, Victor's Hotel is the most frequented, but Laurence's is also a very comfortable and clean Hotel, and the proprietress is English. MADEIRA. There are five or six good English hotels at when single gentlemen can live for from \u00a310 to \u00a316 per month, the charges for families, &c, being somewhat higher. There is an abundance of villa residences, called \" Quintas,\" obtainable in Funchal and its suburbs, and at various heights in the surrounding hills. The rents vary according to size and position from \u00a350 to \u00a3200 for the season \u2014 September and October to May, They are as a rule fully furnished, but visitors are recommended to take plate"], [35, "19 UNION LINE. and linen with them. Whatever may be needed in addition can be obtained ladies. b\u00b0arding h\u00b0USeS k6pt by EngHsh and ForeiSn A representative of the Banner Sanitation Co. has recently been out to inspect and overhaul the sanitary arrangements of Messrs. Reid's hotels. Jones' Bella Vista Hotel has been greatly enlarged with every attention to sanitary principles. Cardwell is adding another large building to his two hotels. A visitor sends us the following :\u2014 \" The English hotels are arranged with much comfort and cleanliness The cleanliness of the one we stayed at (the Carmo) was perfect, and the accommodation and food excellent. The meals are\u2014 breakfast, 8.30 ; lunch, 1 o'clock ; dinner, 6 o'clock ; and a cup of tea in the bed room at 7 a.m., and afternoon tea at 4 p.m. The fruit and vegetables were delicious and abundant at each meal. \"A fixed price includes everything that is provided. There are bath rooms, hot and cold water, a reading room, a beautiful garden with flowers of tropical beauty and abundance, a tennis court and billiard room outside the hotel through the garden. The flowers are exquisite, creepers of lovely form and colour growing from almost every house. In the road, on top of the walls, and in the sugar cane plantations, heliotrope, verbena and geranium grow wild and are considered weeds. \" The hills are steep, and the roads paved with a small round stone but by adopting the soft-soled boots of the country walking becomes easy, The means of getting about are strange. Bullock cars are the vehicles in which ladies who cannot walk do their shopping and calls, and are generally the substitutes for our cabs, &c. Hammocks, carried by two men on a pole, are the means of making longer excursions or taking the air ; and horses, accompanied by a man to each, are much used. The horses are gentle creatures, and the saddles and bridles are very superior to any I ever saw in Switzerland or places where they are constantly on hire for travellers. All vehicles are on runners like sledge runners ; there are only one or two private wheeled vehicles drawn by horses, and one or two public ones for hire drawn by bullocks. The consequence is that the stillness and quietness of the streets are only broken by voices of men and dogs and the footsteps of horses and bullocks. The charges are moderate, and prices aie fixed. The men are very civil, and strong, and sober. The supply of fish is very good and various. The views are beautiful, and the colouring of the trees, soil and houses very bright. The dress required for ladies is only washing print dresses or light materials, and gentlemen, the ordinary summer costume. We noticed very little variations in the temperature, and there was no dampness 111 the air after sunset. We were not invalids, but we noticed that the few invalids in the hotel were out of doors at all hours."], [36, "20 SOUTH AFRICAN GOLD FIELDS. \" There are two excellent English physicians, two German ones, and numerous Portuguese ones who have graduated in Paris, and at the Coimbra University (Portugal), who would give advice as to the class of disease that benefits by the air of Madeira. Three of these gentlemen have studied the climatic changes and have written works on the subject, being well known in the medical world. \"The seamen's hospital, which has done much good amongst the seafaring community, is maintained by charity derived from the Shipping Companies which call at the island, and from the numerous visitors, and is well worthy of inspection. There is a pleasure steamer that skirts the island several times a week, and stops at the various villages on the coast. \" The landing at Funchal is in large boats that come to the ship and take passengers to the shore. \" There is an English minister who conducts the service for the Church of England, and there is a Presbyterian, and, I believe, other Noncon formist chapels. \" To visit Madeira and see the semi-tropical plants, and feel the warm, genial climate, and to see the life of an industrious, contented, and cultivated people, unspoiled by the fashions of European cities, would be a pleasure to many. \" The handsome theatre and public gardens fronting, are well kept up, and are a marked improvement to the town. \" The harbour works, now near completion, the new pier, and the net work of carriage roads round the island \u2014 in the hands of a French contracting company \u2014 will gradually open up this island, unrivalled for its scenery, to pleasure seekers.\" Another Correspondent writes : \u2014 \" I enclose an extract from a letter received from proprietor of the Carmo Hotel, Funchal, as follows : \u2014 ' My tariff, which you ask me for, is ios. per day for board and apartment, and for longer stays it varies from \u00a313 6s. 8d. and upwards per four weeks in accordance with rooms chosen. This price includes meals at public table, lights, attendance, and use of public rooms. The meals are breakfast 9 a.m., luncheon 1 p.m., dinner 7 p.m., tea and coffee at 7 a.m. and 4 p.m.' He sends cards of Royal Edinburgh Hotel and Santa Clara Hotel in Funchal.\" For books of reference on Madeira, see page 46. TENERIFE. The Island of Tenerife, some 250 miles south of Madeira, has within the last few years come into popular favour as a health resort"], [37, "UNION LINE. both on account of the equability and dryness of its climate and the beauties of its scenery. The lovely valley of Orotava on the N.W. side of the Island is the chief centre of attraction. The Taoro Hotel Company has already established a reputation there for its three hotels and one dependence in the Puerto de Orotava, the sea-port town, all under experienced English management ; and there are comfortable hotels at Villa de Orotava at a height of 1,100 feet inland from the port, and at Laguna, 2,000 feet, where cooler temperatures prevail. The Taoro Company have built a new large hotel upon 60 acres of land on the high ground above Port Orotava. The charges are moderate, varying from 8s. to 12s. per day for board and lodging. It is understood that the establishment of other hotels is contemplated. An English Church is being built, and for the present the English chaplain officiates in a temporary building. As regards medical advice, Dr. George Perez, a graduate of the London University, who has practised at the Brompton Consumption Hospital, resides at Orotava. Passengers for Orotava are landed at Santa Cruz, a free port \u2014 no customs, whence they are conveyed by carriages across the island to their destina tion, 25 miles distant. The island is in telegraphic communication with England. For books of reference on Canary Islands, see page 46. OUTFIT FOR VOYAGE TO SOUTH AFRICA. For the early part of the voyage warm clothing is required, but after leaving Madeira, light summer clothing will be found most suitable. Linen, &c, to last until arrival in the Colony should be provided. Those persons intending to proceed up country should provide them selves with clothes of a strong material not liable to be torn easily, but in most South African towns light summer clothing is usually worn. \u25a021"], [38, "22 SOUTH AFRICAN GOLD FIELDS.

SOUTH AFRICA. It may be well to remind our readers that the climatic advantages of Cape Colony and the surrounding country are still too little known or too little appreciated. But we would direct attention to the advantages ofthe Cape to persons who, on account of incipient phthisis, desire to miss one or two English winters. The speed ofthe Mail Steamers, both from London and Southampton, is now so much improved that an average passage does not exceed twenty two or twenty-three days, and the vessels are second to none in liberal feeding and general comfortable arrangements. Most of our leading physicians pronounce Bloemfontein, in the Orange Free State, the proper town to go to, and indeed it appears to be the only town in South Africa that finds a place in etiological prescriptions. But there are many other places that are well worthy of notice. It is undoubtedly prudent to avoid residence in Cape Town, as it is hot and dirty, and the municipality wants sorely the assistance of a medical officer of health ; but the suburb of Wynberg is a charming locality, and should be used by invalids as a sort of half-way house, if they have definitely elected to proceed to the upland districts. It is within easy distance of Cape Town, with an infinitely better climate; and, indeed, pulmonary cripples, who can afford to spend a winter abroad, but cannot compass an expensive inland journey and residence, might live at this village from November to April, for one winter or more, with a very good hope of arresting lung mischief."], [64, "48 SOUTH AFRICAN GOLD FIELDS. The following are Extracts from \" Glanville's Guide to South Africa \" : \u2014 \"There is probably no one physical feature of a new country which awakens so much anxiety in an intending emigrant as climate. And this anxiety is not allayed by scientific statements. It is, however, necessary to preface practical remarks with meteorological facts and figures. The mean temperature of Cape Town is 61 deg. 26 min. Fahrenheit. Other places in the Colony show a lower mark. Cape Town is but little above the sea level, and there are altitudes within the Cape of 8,000 feet. But it is fair to take the facts of climate from the larger centres of population. Some towns might possibly show an average slightly higher than Cape Town, while that of many others is certainly lower. \" The mean temperature of the Colony may be estimated at 63 deg. Now the mean temperature of London is 50 deg. In comparison with London, therefore, the Cape Colony must be considered to be decidedly warm. But it must be remembered that the excess of heat is distributed over all the seasons, and is not poured into the Cape summer alone. Part of it makes the Cape winters mild, while other parts soften the Cape spring and mellow the Cape autumn. No doubt the glass registers a higher figure in the summer at the Cape than it does in England, and the heat is more continuous. One or two other comparisons must be made. The mean temperature of Calcutta is 78.4, of Bombay 81, and of Madras 84. That of Sierra Leone, in tropical Africa, is 76.3, and of the Gold Coast 81. That of Jamaica, in the West Indies, is 81. \" From these statements it will be seen that the mean temperature of the Cape \u2014 63 deg. \u2014 is nearer that of Southern England than of those tropical countries where Englishmen nevertheless manage to live in tolerable numbers. It is twenty degrees below that of Madras, if thirteen degrees above that of London. Compared with the climate of the other British Colonies in the southern hemisphere, that of the Cape occupies a good position. Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide have about the same mean temperature as the Cape. The American Colonies \u2014 Canada, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, &c, \u2014 have a much lower register, owing, principally, to the excessive rigour of their winter. \" The South of Europe, including Italy, Greece, and Spain, comes, under the Isothermal Line of 60 deg., and it may be said that the climate of the Cape, as far as temperature is concerned, is not unlike that of the European Mediterranean Countries, the winters being net quite so cold, and the summers, scarcely, if at all, warmer. The climate of this part of the colonial world is probably unsurpassed for general agreeableness and healthiness. Long stretches of fine, bright, warm weather are succeeded by rains which sometimes are very heavy, but more frequently are lighter and of briefer duration than the agriculturist desires. The winter is short and mild, snow falling only on the summits of the higher mountain"], [65, "49 UNION LINE. ranges. The heat of midsummer is ot course more intense than that of an English July, but at no time is it so excessive as to interfere with out of-door occupations. South Africa has been occupied by Europeans for quite 200 years, and has therefore been tested as a habitation for white men. The descendants of the earliest Dutch settlers are amongst the most robust and largest specimens of the human race. The sanitary returns of the British Army show that the South African garrisons have been remarkably healthy. To persons suffering from chest diseases there are particular parts of South Africa which are especially suitable. The climate of Natal is considered to be agreeable and healthy. The mean annual temperature is about 65. In the summer the heat is subdued by a frequent overclouding of the sky and by storms of rain. The winter months are remarkably pleasant. The rains are periodical, and droughts are not of such frequent occurrence as at the Cape.\" From the \" European Mail.\" South Africa as a Residence for Consumptives. \" Under this head the Lancet prints a long letter which Dr. John Curnow, of Hanover Square, has received from his friend, Mr. W. H. Harrhy, M.R.C.S. The latter left England for the Cape seven years ago, with symptoms of advanced phthisis in both lungs, and, in his own words, ' he was reduced to a most miserable condition.' Finding that Cape Town did not suit him, he made his way to Kimberley, where he commenced practice and soon made a decent living. The dust of the mines in those days, combined with the worry of a general practice in a large town, was not conducive to his health, and at the end of six months he succeeded to a practice in Barkly. He now writes from the Convalescent Home, West Barkly, to his friend, Dr. Curnow. ' You will be glad to hear, I know, that I am in the land of the living yet, and, what is more, that I am in the enjoyment of very good \u2014 I may say robust, health. Ever since I took the practice at Barkly I have been more or less contented with my lot : more contented than otherwise, tor the outdoor country life in a splendid climate (for lungs) has made me a different individual with regard to health. I can now stand \"knocking about\" with most men. I can do fifty and sixty miles, and have done them frequently in a day, in the saddle. I am the Government or district surgeon of the Barkly division \u2014 about the size of a small English county\u2014 a justice of the peace for the division, and the only private practitioner. There are over twenty medical men in Kimberley, twenty-five miles off, if I should require a consultation. It took me two years to quite get rid of my cough and every vestige of expectoration, but twelve months made me quite a different man. A male patient from twelve to fourteen years of age upwards would have the best chance of getting rapidly well here-"], [66, "50 SOUTH AFRICAN GOLD FIELDS. I am sure riding and driving are of invaluable assistance in aiding the damaged lungs to recover.' \" \" Few doctors or patients here are, perhaps, aware that the up-country districts of South Africa can now be easily reached, or that fairly com fortable and well-appointed quarters can be obtained at a distance of 600 miles from Cape Town. When Mr. Harrhy went out, seven years ago, he had to travel a considerable part of the distance by bullock waggon. Now it may be pointed out to those who would wish to follow his example, and test ' South Africa as a residence for consumptives,' that there is a railway right through from Cape Town to Kimberley, and that the cost of the journey from London to the Diamond Fields, including saloon passage and first-class railway fare, is but \u00a345. Latterly, the practice of sending consumptive patients to South Africa has fallen off somewhat. This is due to the number of deaths which have occurred among the patients soon after their arrival in the Cape Colony. Mr. Harrhy, in the course of his letter, says : \u2014 ' Our old family doctor in England, hearing that I was still alive, some years ago sent four patients out in consumption. They all stayed within 200 miles of the coast, where the climate is given to much rain, and consequently the air is moist, hot, and enervating ; they all died.' We shall evidently hear more in the future about South Africa as a home for consumptives, if people will only go into the interior, where the climate is dry, ' too dry for most things but lungs,' and where the nights are cool and refreshing after the hottest day.\" See also \" South Africa as a Health Resort,\" Page 85."], [67, "51 UNION LINE.
