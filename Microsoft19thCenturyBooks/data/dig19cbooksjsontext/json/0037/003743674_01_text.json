The pages that follow contain, with a few slight altera tions and corrections, the bulk of three different series of papers which I contributed, at pretty regular intervals during the years 1877-78\u2014 one to the local Mail, and the two others to the Madras Times. The ' Sketches' in this collection are divided into three Parts: \u2014 Part I relating, more particularly, to the different \" Castes\" ; Part II being descriptive of Professions, and official or other callings ; while Part III is devoted to such of the 'special and supplementary' phases of Native Life as could hardly, in my opinion, be omitted in an account of the present state of our social organisation. The very favorable reception these ' Sketches5 met with on their first appearance, the exceedingly complimentary way in which the Editoi'S of both the above-named journals were pleased to speak of them, and the oft-expressed wish of many of my friends that I should ropublish them in some convenient and preservable shape, have all induced me to submit the present volume to the Reading Public, whom I trust it may serve to amuse or entertain, if not to edify and instruct. Though intended mainly for the European reader, these Sketches are written from an entirely native point of view ; and deal chiefly with such points of interest in tho ' inner social life ' of the Hindu people as do not, from the very nature of things, lie within the range of the ordinary outside observer."], [10, "I am only too painfully conscious that my ' Sketches fall sadly short of the object with which they were written \u2014that, namely, of endeavoring to interest the people of Great Britain and the Colonies in those fellow-subjects of theirs who people this greatest Dependency of the British Crown \u2014 and, in fact, of what I myself could wish them to be. Were I, however, to begin to rewrite them just now (which I have no time to do), I should certainly end in producing a book fuller, perhaps, of information and even interest, but entirely different from my original pro ductions in print. Hence my almost absolute adherence to those originals in form as well as in substance. Such as they are, however, I trust the ' Sketches' will be not un worthy the notice of those interested in the great question of Indian Progress; and it will be no small satisfaction to me, should my humble efforts in this direction prove of any use to those who can bring the force of their high position and influence to bear upon all such questions as concern the welfare of the country.

This belief of ours, we would beg leave to state, is no mere whim or * hobby' ; but is amply borne out not only by incidents of almost daily occurrence in this country, but also by the absurd and amusing errors, though pardonable enough ones in a foreigner, with which books like Meadows Taylor's Tara and Seeta and Allardyce's City of Sun shine, abound in those portions where they attempt to portray the home life and man ners of the Indian people."], [16, "2 THE HINDU HOME. Our present object, therefore, is to submit to the reading public a series of Sketches, of which this is intended to be the first, that will represent the various phases of native Indian domestic life, habits and customs, as much as possible, if not exclusively, from the purely native point of view; and if, in providing readable matter of this nature, we can succeed in directing and fostering that intelligent interest in their Indian fellow- subjects, which we rejoice to see has now been fully awakened in the minds of the British people, that in itself will be to us an abundant recompense. And now let us proceed with the work of delineating, for the benefit of our English readers, the Hindu home, which we have chosen as the subject of our present paper, for several reasons. It is a well known fact that a man is often best known by the sur roundings (material as well as moral) amid which he lives ; while it is an equally weighty, though perhaps not quite so familiar, a"], [17, "3 THE HINDU HOME. truth, that Architecture generally, and do mestic Architecture particularly, furnishes a key to many otherwise unopenable points in national character and customs. Then, too, before treating of the different sub-divisions of the people themselves, it may not be out of place to furnish the reader with a short account of the surroundings amongst which he must expect to find them, and to which we shall continually have occasion to refer in the course of the proposed series of'Pen and-ink Sketches.' With us, Hindus, the idea of a home is a great deal more sacred and binding than it is with the vast majority of Western, and in fact any other, nations ; and, since we are remarkable for conservatism, if we are remarkable for anything, the chief points of interest both in the exterior and interior of our houses are, to a great extent, the same among all castes or sub-divisions in our society. There is not much of show, much less of tinsel, to meet the eye"], [18, "4 THE HINDU HOME. in the outward appearance of the houses of even the wealthiest of Hindus \u2014 except, indeed, in the case of our Anglicised and otherwise (so-called) ' enlightened' country- men who indulge in all imaginable vaga- ries by way not only of house-building, but also of dress, and even the adoption of foreign manners. A very plain exterior will meet you as you approach the dwelling of the Hindu who has not departed from the simple and yet most suitable customs of his fathers. A narrow street porch (going com- monly under the outlandish name of a veranda) consisting of a pial (or raised base ment) Some two or three feet from the ground, covered by a light roof of bamboos or slit palmyra, surmounted by the coarse red tile so familiar here, runs along the whole front of the building. This roof is supported by pillars of teak or other native timber ; and the whole veranda serves the double purpose of affording shelter to the passer-by, and, occasionally, temporary lodg ing to the poor and the stranger, as also of"], [19, "5 THE HINDU HOME. warding off the solar glare from such of the interior apartments as happen to look street wards. In the centre of this street-porch are a few steps leading to the door, which is the main, and most frequently the only, means of ingress to and egress from the house. Not only the steps but also a good square-yard of ground in front of them, are swept clean, sprinkled with that Hindu domestic abomination which a friend of ours (learned in the Anglo-Saxon tongue) calls \" cowdung solution\" (!), and further orna mented with pretty devices in powdered chalk. The points that next attract one's attention are the festoon of leaves hung along the lintel, and the threshold and the lower halves of the door-posts being daubed over with saffron paste, and streaked and dotted at regular intervals with the red meal called kunkumam, which is most commonly used by native women in the mark they wear on their foreheads. All this ornamen tation, as indeed tho minutest detail in our social customs, has a meaning. The thresh-"], [20, "6 THB HINDU HOME. old is supposed to be the favorite haunt of Lakshmi, who is the wife of Vishnu (the preserving power in the Hindu Triad), and who, as her name signifies, is not only the deified embodiment, but also the source of all wealth and prosperity. Thus, you will observe how carefully, in entering or leaving the house, all Hindus will avoid treading on the threshold \u2014 always stepping over it with a caution bordering on positive reverence. On either side of the door-way are niches (most frequently triangular, but in these degenerate days of many other shapes) for placing lamps in. There are some more of these in the verandas on either side ; but they are only called into requisition at rare intervals, on such occasions, for instance, as the (Dipavali) \" Feast of Lamps.\" And now let us enter the house. You must bend pretty low unless you happen to be rather under five feet in stature \u2014 the distinguishing feature in the Hindu door- way being that it is almost square, and,"], [21, "THE HINDU HOME. 7 that its height seldom exceeds sive feet, being often much lower. The door, we should not omit to mention, is a massive conjunction of planks, fully an inch and a half thick, with deeply sculptured cross- pieces four, or even five, times as bulky. Well, passing through this somewhat for- midable entrance, we come upon a lobby or entrance-hall with a pial, some seven or eight feet long by three or four broad, on your right, and a locked-up room on your left, of which more anon. This part of the house is dignified with the appellation of rizhi; and is a sort of reception hall, no persons of a caste lower than the owner's being allowed to pass further, except under exceptional circumstances, such as the admission of a doctor in cases of sickness. The pial is used for a variety of purposes besides that of seating visitors. The male members of the family use it as their dressing-room when they take their periodi cal shave at the barber's hands. The curd seller, the vegetable-vendor and other"], [22, "8 THE HINDU HOME.. similar individuals, of whom the family are regular constituents, will assemble here every morning; and, depositing their baskets or other incumbrances' on the pial, keep shouting for the mistress of the house or somebody else to come and take what may be needed for the day's use. Here too will congregate from morning to noon, and from night-fall to two or three hours there after, almost every type and variety of the genus beggar, some of them indulging in most execrable attempts at vocal music ; others supplementing whining supplications with the sound of cymbals and stringed instruments (!), and others again yelling at the top of their voices for \" only a mouth ful of rice.\" But we are staying too long in the entrance passage. Passing through the lobby, and entering another, smaller, door, we come upon an inner veranda, skirting what foreign ers rightly term the redeeming feature in Hindu domestic architecture, namely the"], [23, "9 THE HINDU HOME. quadrangular courtyard (called militant) which is similarly bounded on all four sides \u2014 the several rooms of the houses opening on the verandas and thus securino the admission of a supply of light and air which would otherwise be utterly impossi ble. At the angle of the courtyard nearest the kitchen, is a well with a wooden lattice work frame inside, and a rope-and-wheel scaffolding above. Adjoining the kitchen, among the inner rooms, is a half-open apart ment called the kidam, which, being the dining room, is always kept scrupulously clean. Though tempted very much to do so here, we must reserve a description of a native Indian meal for another occasion ; and proceed with our description of the house itself. In the same line with the kitchen and kutam, or at right angles, or, again, in lines parallel to them are other rooms, chiefly those occupied by the several mem bers of the family and furnished according to the occupant's means. Among people of tho 'twice-born' castes, as they are called, B"], [24, "10 THE HINDU HOME. there is always a room set apart for tho worship of the family, tutelar, and other deities ; and, besides the adjuncts to such worship, the room will probably also be tho receptacle of all the family valuables. And now, lastly, for the room we men- tioned as lying to our left as we entered the house. It is the state-room of the whole establishment, and is under the immediate control of the head of the family. It is amply carpeted and cushioned, and may even contain a few chairs and sofas. The walls are adorned with mirrors and foreign prints fof no great character, and also dis- play some of those well-known perspective less paintings that our local native artists alone can produce, chiefly comprising \" studies\" from Hindu Mythology ! On wed ding and other festive occasions, this apart ment is further ornamented with flowers, colored paper and tinsel, fumigated with benzoin and otherwise perfumed, and as brilliantly lighted up as circumstances will"], [25, "11 THE HINDU HOME. allow. Nautches and other social gather ings will, of course, be held here ; but, during the greater part of the year this ' best room' will be, as we have seen it, kept under lock and key. Such is the average Hindu home, so far as its material adjuncts and belongings are concerned. In our next paper we hope to be able to introduce our readers to one, at least, of the many different kinds of people who inhabit buildings of this description, and see how they live, and move, and have their being. Meanwhile we trust we shall not be con sidered as having taken up too much space or time for these comparatively minor fea tures in the social and domestic economy of the chief representatives, in the present day, of the original Aryan race."], [26, "No. II.\u2014 THE BRAHMAN. \" Bevddhinam jagatsarvam ; Mantrddhinam taddevatd; Tanmdhtrm Brdhmanddhinam ; Brdhmand mamade vatd.\" [Translation. \u2014 The whole world is under tho coutrol of the gods ; Those gods are under the control of prayers (mantra) ; Those prayers are under the control of the Brahmans ; (therefore) The Brahmans are oar gods. | SO reads one of the nrost familiar, and yet, perhaps, most fundamental, among the sacred sutra (texts) in that system of religious belief which, closely interwoven with its sister-systems of jurisprudence and philosophy, still commands the admiration and study of the learned world. It is no wonder, therefore, that, among a peoplo who are essentially conservative, and who are governed by the tenets of this system with a despotism that words would fail to"], [27, "13 THE BRAHMAN. describe adequately \u2014 it is no wonder, we repeat, that the Brahman, individually, and as a class, occupies the very highest position, .socially, politically, mentally and perhaps even morally, in the great native Indian commonwealth. Hence it is that we have chosen the Brahman for the subject for our present paper. The Brahman \"caste,' however, is so rami fied and sub-divided that it will be ne cessary for us to briefly describe these different sects, chiefly for the information of the foreign reader. The grand sub-divi sion in the Hindu religious system is into the followers of Vishnu, who are termed Vaishnava; and those of Siva, who are termed Saiva. The Vaishnava Brahmans are again sub-divided into three sects, Aiyan gdr, Madhva, and GolkondaVydpari. Among the Saiva Brahmans we have the Desasta the Niydgi and the Vaidiki sects. The Aiyangdr sect is almost entirely con fined to Southern India ; or, strictly speak-"], [28, "14 THE BRAHMAN. ing, to the Tamil country; since its members not only speak Tamil, no matter what part of the country they are domiciled in, but their whole ritual is also in that language. Our readers will best recognise the Aiyangdr caste of Brahman by our describ ing them as those wearing the trident mark, consisting of a yellow or scarlet streak with two white ones on either side, joined at the bottom either by a mutual curve, or by a third small white streak just between the eyebrows, and a daub of the white paint, in the form of a triangle coming down the nose. This slight difference in the making of the mark denotes a further sub-division of the caste into the Tengalai, and Vadagalai sects. These two demi-sub divisions, so to speak, have only religious differences, eating in each other's houses and even inter-marrying. The great haunt of this particular kind of Vaishnava Brahman in any town or village is the vicinity of a Vaishnava temple \u2014 a large majority of them being employed as servants, and otherwise"], [29, "15 THE BRAHMAN. hanging on the sacred establishment. The scene at a tank in front of one of these temples any morning might form a picture perfect in its 'Orientalism'. Suppose we visit one of them. You have to descend by some half a dozen steps to come to the water- edge. The steps extend almost all round the tank, which is some fifty feet square. See what a motley group is collected before you. To your right, there is an Aiyangar gentleman who has just finished his ablutions and prayers (the latter almost invariably accompany the former according to Hindu usage) ; and he is a particularly prepossessing specimen of this particular sub-division of the human race. A white cotton cloth, about twelve cubits in length, by three in breadth, with a border on either side of red and yellow silk, fully four inches broad, is the sole garment in which he is clad, but which, nevertheless, sets him off to considerable advantage. We wish, though, he had fewer of those 'marks' on. Being stripped to the waist, and wanting,"], [30, "16 THE BRAHMAN. probably, to make up for lack of vesture, he has painted these marks on every conceivable part of his trunk, not even excepting such out-of-the-way and almost unpaintable places as the nape of the neck, and the centre of the back where the -spine meets the groin. Turning away from this almost tiger-painted creature, our attention is drawn to a group of women in the rear, distance. One of them is washing out a cloth (for laundress' work forms ai very fair proportion of domestic duty among our women), another is having a sort of scrub bath, which the others seem to have finished, for we observe their perfectly saturated garments clinging to their limbs. Each of the women has brought a large brass vessel for carrying drinking water to the house in ; and, after duly burnishing and replenishing the same, the whole party will set off in single file towards their respective houses. Then, look a little in front of you ; and what do you behold ? A mau stripped to the waist, and with his"], [31, "17 THE BRAHMAN. nether garments tucked up above the knee, standing in the water with the thumb and forefinger of his right hand closing tight over his nostrils, the little linger painfully lifted up (heaven- wards ?). He is perform ing perhaps the most holy and certainly the most binding, of ceremonies in the ritual entailed on every Brahman \u2014 to wit the Gdyatri, or prayer to the sun. It may not be out of place to mention here that it is owing to the impossibility of being able to perform this ceremony on board a ship that the orthodox Hindu considers a Brahman to have lost his caste and social status direct ly he crosses the water ! One more selec tion from the scene before us, and we have done. We need be under no compunction whatever as to our desecrating the puja bora sanctity or otherwise wounding the religious feelings of the two young fellows whom we now approach, and who salute ns with a ' good morning' instead of the traditional namaskdram (worship). They are also Brahmans; but Brahmans of the c"], [32, "18 THE BRAHMAH. \" Eumayscha agejao\" * class, so admirably taken off not only by the \"inimitable Dave,\" but also by the well-known author of \" Lays of Ind\" ; but we are unable to say whether they are Aiyangars or not, since they have not yet painted on their ' mark,' if indeed they at all trouble themselves with going through such an old-fangled operation. We fear these two young fellows are too degenerate to go through a bath or puja \u2014 in fact, they are not ashamed to avow that they can more easily spout Milton or Scott, than they can repeat their own Sanskrit prayers ! Well, so much for the Aiyangdr section of the Brahman commu nity, in closing our short notice of whom, however, we ought not to leave our readers under the impression that the Aiyangdr haB no representative in the higher walks of life.

And now for the Madhva sub-division of the Vaishnava Brahman class. The members of this sect are more widely distributed, not only over this Presidency but even found in the extreme northern and western parts of the country. These Brahmans almost invariably have the title of \" Rau\" ; and are to be found in every rank of life, from that of the profes sional cook, or sweet-meat seller, to that of the highest in the land. We don't believe there is any one class of natives who are to be found in such numbers, both in Govern ment service and other situations of impor tance. Witness, e. g., the lists periodically published of Deputy Collectors, Tahasildars, tt hoc genus omne. The caste mark of the Madhva consists of a circular spot of black"], [34, "20 THE BRAHMAN. paste in the centre of the forehead, from the edge of whose circumference there runs a narrow black line upwards to the roots of the hair. Stamps, bearing impressions of the discus and conch (the emblems of Vishnu, are dipped in sandal-wood paste, and pressed against the cheeks, shoulders, and different parts of the chest, by way of further ornamentation in the 'mark' line. Our recollections of the Madhva Brahman are, for by far the greater part, associated with the \" Cutcherry\" (or public life) ele ment of Anglo-Indian (rather than native Indian) life in this country ; and this ele ment we intend scrupulously to avoid introducing into this series of papers. So we shall conclude our remarks concerning them with what we trust will not be regard ed as an impertinent compliment, namely, that in a country where good looks are rather the rule than the exception, Madhva Brahman women excel in beauty, \"than which,\" as a well-known English writer has said, \" no electro-biology is more potent.\""], [35, "21 TBI BRAHMAN. Last ia the Golkonda Vyapari class whom we shall dismiss very summarily, since they are a very small class and almost unknown beyond that portion of the Telugu country known as the Northern Sirkars. The sect is but of recent origin ; and, strangely enough, its members are part Vaishnava, part Saiva. Their cooks [and, cooks in a 'Brahman house-hold must be particularly holy' (?) men] are Vaish nava ; but those who attend to their spiri tual wants are Saiva. They commonly wear the (Vaishnava) trident ' mark j but substi tute Saiva ashes for it on all ceremonial occasions. We now come to the Saiva, who are, per haps, the most numerous in this part of India. The Besasta may be disposed of in a few words ; for he may be briefly described as being almost identical with the Madhva, talking Kanareseor Maharathalike him, and almost exclusively fonnd in the seoular de partments of livelihood."], [36, "22 THE BRAHMAN. The Niydgi and Vaidiki sects are the two chief sub-divisions in the class of Saiva Brahmans known as Smdrta \u2014 the former (Niydgi) being engaged in secular pursuits ; while, as their name implies, the Vaidiki sect is entirely devoted to the discharge o\u00a3 sacerdotal and ecclesiastical functions. Thus you will find the Karanam (accountant) ia a village, or the Head Gumasta (clerk) in a Taluk Magistrate's office, rejoicing in the title of 'Panhdw,' which is that proper to the NiySgi sect} while, if you want a learned PanditfOr fkePurdhita (priest) who officiates at marriage or funeral ceremonies, you will probably be introduced to a gentleman plenti fully besmeared with the 'ashes' sacred to Siva, and answering to a long unpronounce able name, ending in 'Sastri, which is the honorific to which all learned members of the VaiMki sect are entitled.

AS we indicated at the conclusion of our last paper, we purpose just now to furnish the reader with a short account of the domestic life and customs of the Brah man caste of Hindus, as exhibited in their every-day life and occupations. Each of these social customs has a certain signifi cance attached to it ; and, hence, its per formance is enjoined as part and portion of that inflexible system of priestcraft by which the vast majority of our countrymen are still governed. We fear that the greater part of Brahmans residing in or in the vicinity of, large towns are more or less too Anglicised to serve as representatives of the class to which they belong. Hence we must trouble the reader to accompany us, in thought, to a middle-"], [39, "25 BRAHMAN HOUSEHOLD. sized Mofussil station. We will here find a street or streets, or just as often a de tached plot of ground, set apart wholly for the residence of this holy (Brahman) caste, and going under the appellation of Agraharam. It is the cleanest, perhaps the healthiest, site in the whole locality. The houses are more or less after the fashion of that depicted in our first paper, and so we will not say much more of them here, than that they are kept very neat and clean, evincing an air of comfort so thoroughly oriental in all its aspects as to leave lasting and lively impressions for good on the foreign beholder. Our present business, however, is to con cern ourselves with the occupants of these houses, the Agrahdrika, as the dweller in an Agraharam is named ; and, with this object in view, let us go up to what seems to be one of the best houses in the whole group before us.

A ve'shti (waist cloth) some twelve cubits long, elaborately puckered up in front, with one end folded narrow, passed between the legs and inserted at the waist, covers the nether extremities from the loins downwards, and the rest of the body is left bare, if, indeed, you except the idtariyam (upper cloth) which hangs, also folded narrow, on one shoulder.

Let us enter the house and see what sort of creatures the women of the household are, and how they spend their day. A Sudra servant has just brought in a num ber of brass and copper utensils, used over night, at the sight of which a woman, probably a daughter-in-law of the family, emerges from the kitchen, and begins sprink ling them with holy water, previous to removing them inside for use. We will sketch her as she stands, with the holy water still in hand. She is a fair average specimen of the Smarta Brahmani (fern, of Brahman) ; is of middle height and very well developed physical proportions. Her complexion is that peculiarly Indian shade of brown known as bamboo, while her hair, which is neatly plaited up at the back of the head, and eyes are of that lustrous purply blackness which is utterly unknown beyond the regions of the tropics. Her dress consists of a single piece of cloth, or"], [42, "28 LIFE IN A rather silk interspersed with flax, a fabric which is used by the Brahman and the higher castes when they are in the state of madi (ceremonial purity).

It is sixteen to eighteen cubits long, by two to three broad, and, in its almost artistic disposal, comprises skirt, mantle, and even trousers (!), all in one. A silk choli, as it is called, is worn on the bust as a half-bodice. The Hindu female costume, however, as some of our readers may be aware, is commonly, and perhaps not unjustly, considered incomplete without the adjuncts of jewellery. Accord ingly, we find our Brahmani wearing necklace, ear-rings and bracelets of gold, the pendant to the necklace, and one of the ear-rings being studded with roughly-cut gems of some small value, and anklets and toe-rings of silver. Each of these pieces of"], [43, "BRAHMAN HOUSEHOLD. 29 jewellery would form a perfect study to the foreign artist \u2014 the chief feature in them being that they are exceedingly solid aud massive \u2014 being, according to true Hindu fashion, made more with a view to intrinsic value, than to mere prettiness. Our des cription would be incomplete if we omitted to mention that every visible part of the Brahmani's body is besmeared with saffron, with an additional coating of sweet-smelling sandalwood paste on the throat, hands, and arms. Last, though not least, is the caste mark, a circular spot made of the vermilion paste called kunkumam in the centre of the forehead.

Let us briefly enumerate the principal of these \"^sub-divisions.'' First, there are the agriculturalist classes \u2014 proprietory and labouring. The former are known by the name of Velldlar in the Tamil, and Velama, Kamma, or Kdpu, in the Telugu, country. The latter are chiefly represented by the Vanniyar in the^Tamil speaking districts ; while, among the Telu gus, the poorer members of the proprietory agriculturist castes are the laborers. Then"], [65, "51 THE SUDRA. there is the pastoral or shepherd caste, called Yidaiyar in Tamil, and Gotta in Telugu. There is also the Sudra sub-caste, so to speak, the hereditary occupation of whose members is, that of keeping (revenue) ac counts, and whose caste designation has, accordingly, passed into a synonym for an accountant or writer. We ought not to omit to mention also the Mudaliydr and Ndyudu castes, who are the most enlightened and influential, if they are not the most numerous, portion of the Hindu Sudra people. They are for the most part found in the larger towns, and in almost every department of the public ser vice. It is, perhaps, next to impossible to define the exact social limits of these class es, \u2014 in fact, in these degenerate days of ours, it is simply astonishing to observe with what a number of other castes (and out-castes) it has become the fashion to"], [66, "52 THE SUDRA. adopt these titles. There is a somewhat vulgar, but very expressive, Tamil proverb that says. \" The son of a dancing girl at tached to a Saiva temple is (or, rather, be comes when circumstances allow) a Mu daliydr !\" Well, the state of Hindu Sudra Society being such, the reader will easily under stand what a loss we must be at in select ing any one of the different sub-divisions we have just mentioned as a representative of the general class Sudra. Realising this difficulty, and not wishing to deprive the reader of any item of importance or inter est in native Indian Sudra life, we purpose confining our remarks, on the present oc casion, only to the more general character istics of *he Sudra people, hoping to take up one or more of the different ' subcastes* as material for subsequent sketches. Going about (as the majority of natives of this country do) stripped to the waist j"], [67, "53 THE SUDRA. the Sudra is most easily distinguishable by the absence of the sacred thread, which only the three higher, or ' twice-born' castes, are entitled to wear sashwise across the left shoulder.

Sudra women, too, may be most easily distinguished from their ' twice-born' sis ters by the style in which they dress, or rather in which they dispose the single piece of cloth (sixteen^ cubits long by two and-a-half broad) which comprises the greater part by far of a Hindu lady's toi lette. The Chdli (or hall boddice) is seldom"], [68, "54 THE SUDRA. or never worn, 'except indeed in the case of very young women or on festival occasions.

A good deal of this ' characteristic dirt and slovenliness' is due, perhaps, as much to poverty as to the fact of the national sloth having (in the case of the Sudra) no counteracting in fluence such as that provided for the ' twice born' castes in the formulae of physicial as well as moral and spiritual conduct that are enjoined on them under pain of the direst degradation. And then as to Sudra eating and drink ing. Animal food (always excepting, of"], [69, "THE SUDRA. 55 course, the flesh of the holy cow) and spiri tuous liquors are, almost invariably, the essential elements in a Sudra meal, except in the case of the very poorest classes, or, also, among those Sddras who practise what is called Saivam, or total abstinence from fish, flesh, fowl, and intoxicating drinks. With the majority of Sudras^food is eaten out of brass or other metal vessels in preference to, or as commonly as off, the * plates of leaf which are used by the higher castes. The Sudra has nothing like domestic worship answering to the devatdrchana in the homes of the twice-born. It is only on the occasion of a wedding or funeral that something like a formal worship is gone through. A Brahman, most frequently the village (or caste) priest, is invited and presented with cloths, money, betel-and nut, as well as the ingredients for a good meal \u2014 rice,dhal (native pulse), ghee (clarified butter), vegetables, pepper, salt and other"], [70, "56 THE SUDRA. condiments. In consideration of this no despicable 'fee,' the Brahman will go through a certain fixed ceremonial, mumbling over the sacred texts, much to the admira tion (but absolutely nothing to the edifica tion) of his audience, who might as well be listening to a Latin 'Mass,' or a Greek recitation. But Sudra religious interests are not altogether neglected. Look at the crowds that flock to a temple on the occasion of any festival ; and see if the percentage of Sudras therein is not considerable over seventy-five. It is a sight that may be witnessed any day on some of our public thoroughfares. Women decked out in their finest cloths and jewels (not unfrequently borrowed from those obliged to stay at home) sporting more than all the hues of the rain bow, and no small quantity of gold, silver and false lace and brocade, with a whole lot of flowers and sweet-smelling herbs (like marjoram) in the plaits and other styles and shapes in which they dress and dispose the hair.

An agriculturalist Mudaliydr, unlike his brethren in other walks of life, is almost in variably found in the Mofussil, and, even there, his home is in the more remote village rather than in the Khasba, as the District towns are called. To a homestead in such a locality, therefore, where the Mudaliydr can give his lands and other belongings the full benefit of his personal supervision, we must invite the reader to accompany us if he wishes to see something of the home-life and every-day occupations of this particular sub-division of Hindu Sudra society."], [77, "63 THE MUDALIYAR.

Her husband, our Mudaliydr's son and heir, is performing his morning toilet at the extreme end of one of the pials, sputtering, spitting and clearing his throat with that grating sound that is as invariably the accompaniment of a genuine Hindu 'facewashing,' as the chombu (globular vessel) of polished brass, containing water at his elbow. Another daughter of the house is, probably, busy in the kitchen cooking a meal, or distributing the remains of the previous night's supper to such as may prefer a cold meal for breakfast.

As the meaning of the Tamil word by which their caste is called indicates, the first of these three classes [Kanahhar) are those known as the ' accountant' or ' writer' caste. Their hereditary occupation is that of keeping the revenue and other accounts of the village, as well as that of following the vocation of a professional scribe. They are called Karnam in Telugu.

As we approach it this morning, there is a motley, picturesque, gathering of people, not only in the street, but also on the outer pials of the Pillai's house, which are duly protected from heat and glare by the light palmyra-and-tile roofs, as well as by sundry screens and other specimens of local manufacture, in the mat and wicker-work line. Let us briefly notice the elements composing the group assembl- ed before us.

In front of him,, leaning half drowsily against"], [97, "83 THE PILLAI. one of the wooden pillars supporting the roof already mentioned, is the Grama Mun sif, a report from whom to the Magistrate of the Division, the Kanakka Pillai is busi ly engaged in writing out at present.

He has just returned from his station house, or is just as probably on his way to some special c beat' ; but he evidently doesn't think that looking in for a few minutes at our Pillai' s (where he will hear the freshest gossip, and probably get a drink of butter-milk, or at least a cigar, or a pinch of snuff) will very seriously interfere with the efficient dis- charge of his duties ; and hence we find him cooling his heels, or rather his whole body, here.

Near him are seated a couple of his neighbors, debtor and creditor. Either an instalment in liquidation of a debt is to be paid, or a fresh sum of money to be advanced ; and, as we have said already, where else can this be done better than before the ' Pillai' ? Lurking away in one corner of the pial is a member of the village mercantile community who is plaintiff in a suit instituted on a bond which the Kanak ka Pillai has attested . The defendant is a wealthy trader ; and the 'lurking' Ghetti has heard that the ' Pillai' has been cited as a witness on the other side. To confirm his suspicions, there is the Amina, or officer of the Court who serves parties with sum monses ; and he (the Ghetti) is evidently turning over in his mind what he ought to do now. There is also a messenger from the office of the divisional 1 revenue authori ties with orders for ' supplies,' or some such"], [99, "85 THE PILLAI. other requisition.

The Reddi is al most always an agriculturist, either proprie tory or laboring; and, so, although we could not say, with truth, that every raiyat (Hindustani for farmer or tenant) is a Reddi, yet we might safely venture to say that, in almost ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, every Reddi is a raiyat.

To the left, near the door, are three or four primitive fire places, built high (or low) enough to allow of cooking in a sedentary posture. At the angles of the wall, in the close vicinity of the fire-place, are tiers of pots beginning with those of a size large enough to be used as a bathing tub, and tapering upwards to the tiny little chatti with a mouth just sufficiently large to admit your finger. These pots contain household stores, such as rice, salt, or tama- rind. Then there are a few slings of rope- netting suspended from the smoke be darkened rafters, in which are placed vessels holding ghee, jaggari, aud such other arti cles as are likely to be attacked by ants and other vermin. Conspicuously arranged"], [105, "THE RAIYAT, OR \" REDDI,\" 91 also are the cooking vessels, almost all of the coarse country pottery, though kept as clean as is compatible with the material of which they are made. A few pieces o^ rough matting, a stray box or two, with a stout wooden pestle, heavily shod with iron at both ends, and a stone mortar, in two parts, in company with a stone for grinding currystuffs, lie against the bare walls of the house, which are further embellished by pieces of rope strung across to do duty for the clothes-horse. Then there are a couple of large baskets, or rather wicker-work cylinders, used as receptacles of grain, and a rude bedstead perhaps, of coir rope net work on a frame and legs of jungle timber. Add to these a couple of those spindle and distaff apparatus, one might any day find women by the score sitting, working at in any native village, and the inventory of the contents of the Raiyat's house, (minus the live stock) is complete.

Both he and his younger brothers are, you will see, up ; and are each doing ample justice to a large basin of cold (or rather decomposing) rice and water with the fain- test dash of sour buttermilk, taking a bite every now and then off the green chillies provided by way of a relish. This fortifica- tion of the inner man being over, the Raiyat repairs to the backyard of the house whither we shall follow him, stepping carefully the while over the sleeping bodies of the juvenile members of the family who have not yet begun to run their daily course of duty. A couple of bullocks, and a milch buffallo with her calf, are here, as well as refuse of every imaginable description, and revolting to every sense. The yard itself is a piece of ground not more than twenty yards square, enclosed by mud walls topped with palmyra leaves. There is a tamarind tree, and a couple of those trees producing the Indian vegetable termed 'drumstick,'"], [107, "THE RAIYAT, OR \" REDDI.\" 93 and also creeping plants of the gourd kind trailing about all over the place, which is at once cattle-shed, dust-bin, manure-heap, bath-room and latrine. Near the cattle is a large earthen tub, half buried in the ground into which are emptied the kadugu and kanji of the family establishment, the for- mer being the water in which the rice is washed clean before being boiled, the latter the thin gruel strained off when the rice has been cooked. Leavings at meals, and other odd scraps of edible matter are also thrown in, and the compound thus made goes to form a nourishing and perhaps even palatable drink for the cattle. In one cor- ner there is a plough of precisely the same kind as that used by our Aryan ancestors, centuries ago. Shouldering this agricul- tural implement, the Raiyat dons his sandals, tucks up his single garment a few inches above his knees, and sets off to his work in the fields, at a distance, his brothers follow ing with the bullocks and some more tools, while the Raiyat's mother and his wife busy"], [108, "THE RAIYAT, OR \" REDDI.\" 94 themselves with the duties of the household for the day. The children are half coaxed, half -frightened off the floor (we can't say out of bed), and are despatched to the back yard to make themselves clean \u2014 a process they seem to stand sadly in need of. While the old lady superintends the youngsters' morning toilettes (!), the younger one pro ceeds to sweep the house and front pials sprinkling them with a pretty thick solu tion of cowdung, and ornamenting the floor between the pials and just in front of the house, with quaint designs in powdered chalk. The sweeping over, the children are fed, and then the housewife goes to the well, along with her daughter perhaps, or a younger sister of her husband's, to bring in the required quantity of drinking water for household consumption. She will next go to the nearest bazaar to sell whatever home produce she may have : say, a pumpkin, or some tender tamarind leaves (esteemed a delicate acid seasoning) milk, curds or ghee} the produce of the buffalo, of which mention"], [109, "THE RAIYAT, OR \" REDDI.\" 95 has already been made, and occasionally alse hanks of yarn spun by her mother-in-law, who is even now busy at her wheel. From the bazaar, the Raiyat's wife will return home bringing a small quantity of meat or fish, of possibly rather questionable quality; and will at once set to work, preparing the midday meal. When the business of cook- ing is over, the first thing that is done is to send off their share of the food to the men working in the fields. This is taken in a basket or in pots slung on a stick and carri- ed on the shoulders. After eating follows the traditional siesta, in which even out-door laborers indulge ; and then again as the old woman settles down to work at the spinning wheel, the young ones go through a repe- tition of the same routine of duties as in the morning, sweeping, going for water, marketing, and cooking, so as to have the supper ready by the time the men return home.

And we may be pretty sure that these young women, though perfectly used to, and even content with, this sort of thing, have no easy time of it. They will have to rise before dawn to attend, the one to the pots and pans used at the preceding night's meal, and the other to the drawing and storing of water for drinking or lavatory purposes.

After returning home there will be the usual routine of cooking, eating, and sleep ing too, amid all the diversified vocations which the Hindu housewife has to follow. Such is a brief sketch of the daily life in au average Golla household, comparatively monotonous and uneventful.

And yet, when you sit down and think about it, it is neither difficult nor uninterest ing to jot down a few particulars which might unhesitatingly be designated as the ' distinguishing characteristics' of this sub division of Hindu Society. The Native Indian goldsmith is, to begin with, easily known by the yajnopavitam (not unfrequently of silver or gold) which he wears across the left shoulder, and on the strength of which, most probably, he lays claim to the social status of the holy Brahman. The women, too, of this sect are at once made out, as much by their peculiar stamp of features, as by the Brali manish disposition of their cloth. And then the Pdnchdla people abstain, or at least profess to abstain, from animal food and strong dank. It may not be out of place, though certainly far from complimentary, to state that Indian goldsmiths are by birth, by caste, and by professional etiquette (!) what are termed in the polite phraseology N"], [120, "106 THE PANCHALA, OR GOLDSMITH. of the day ' kleptomaniacs.' In fact so proverbial is the development of the thiev ing faculty in workmen of this caste, that there is a saying among us which informs you that a goldsmith cannot make an orna ment even for his own wife, without first secreting some of the gold or silver given him for working upon ! And new let us pay a visit to the labora tory of one of these native Indian gold and silversmiths. It is nothing more than a Bmall room, or a part of the verandah screened off, opening streetwards, as much for the admission of air and light, as for the convenience of customers and such of the passers-by who might look in for a bit of fire to light a cheroot with.

Crucibles of clay, or cow dung, baked hard in the sun, tongs and hammers, potsherds of charcoal, dirty tins of water, and little packets of sal ammoniac, resin, or other similar substances, all lie scattered about the floor in picturesque confusion. Sitting, or rather crouching, on their haunches, in postures as comically as they are intuitively suggestive of Darwin's theory of the Descent of Man, are a couple of the Pdnchdla workmen themselves. One of them is blowing a pan of charcoal into flame through an iron tube some eighteen inches long by one in diameter, stirring up the loose charcoal with that languid nonchal ance which is so provoking to the European. Another is hammering, with equal laziness, at a piece of silver wire on a little bit of anvil before him ; while a third is ' taking it easy ;' but all the while making a customer, seated by, believe that he is working very hard, over a piece of work that has, most probably, been laid aside untouched for sjOtne weeks past.

With all his faults, therefore \u2014 and the best of men are not faultless \u2014 the native goldsmith is a deci dedly useful and even ornamental member of our society, one of whom we might well be proud, tjking all things into consideration. We ought not to omit to mention that, besides being workers in the precious and other metals, members of the Pdnchdla caste are also blacksmiths, carpenters, builders and sculptors. A very small proportion of these castes are followers of the god Vishnu : the bulk of them profess the Saiva faith ; but are, in reality, worshippers of demons or the inferior orders of tutelar deities known in the country by the name of Grdma Be'vata.

The interior economy of Panchala home steads has nothing in it particularly striking , or particularly different from those of other castes.

However involved in doubt and even dishonor their origin may be, there is no denying that they form an absolutely indispensable element in our native social organization ; and we should, therefore, be guilty of an almost unpardon able indiscretion, if, in what professes to be a description of Hindu home life, we should fail to take at least the slight notice we now have done of them."], [125, "No. XII\u2014 THE OUT-CASTES.

Indeed, strictly speaking, the Pariah is rather a non-caste than an oui-caste. Hence there arises the necessity for distinguishing between the non-caste and out-caste population of the country ; and we wish it to be distinctly understood that we purpose not only making the distinction, but also carrying out the theory into practice in writing this sketch.

We refer to such elements in our social organisation as the barber, tha washerman, the toddy-drawer, the fisher man, the potter, and such like. Each of these callings, as is well-known, is in the habitual and hereditary keeping of a parti cular (so-called) caste, and to do otherwise would be considered a disgrace if not a posi tive prime. With us the male members of the Amba ta, or Mangala (barber), caste, besides be ing hair-dressers, are also, some of them, musicians; and, in the latter capacity, form an indispensable feature in all our social and even religious festivities.

Ironing could not have been in existence as a distinct calling in the times when our castes and sub-castes came into existence ; and so we have no particular caste following this vocation ; while curiously enough, it is not taken up by the washermen themselves, every ironer of our acquaintance (and we have had more than enough of their said acquaintance) being of some other superior caste.

The Munsif himself, you will find seated inside a small 'railed and raised' enclosure at one end of the cen- tral hall of the building. In front of him crowding on benches that surround the three sides of a rough square table, are the Vakils, the members of the local bar ; while, seated at another table, plac- ed against the railings of the bench (!) is the Gumasta (clerk), whose duty it is to take down the depositions of witness in extenso, as well as to 'swear' them in before they begin to depose. To the Munsif's right, squatting on a little bit of carpeting spread on the floor, there is another Gumasta superintending the stamp ing of a number of (duplicate) processes with a seal bearing a facsimile of the Munsif's signature. Besides doing this, he is often called upon to do odds and ends of work in the way of writing. Some times, for instance, the Munsif finds (as he almost always does on those days set"], [139, "THE \" MUNSIF.\" 122 a part for the hearing of what are called 'small' causes) that he has more cases on hand he can get through, if he were to have them called on one by one ; and, accordingly, it is no uncommon scene for two, and sometimes even three, cases being called on simultaneously, and the evidence taken down simultaneously, one in front, and the other on each side of the learned Munsif, who is, of course, supposed to be attending to them all with equal care and thought. The day when we pay our visit, however, is not such a very busy day ; and yet there is quite enough and to spare of noise and bustle such as are the invariable accompaniments of any public proceeding in the country. Not only are the Court room, verandahs and oven office-room filled by almost every variety of the genus liti gant, as well as their agents and legal advi sers ; but here are also to be found such ele ments (indispensable in Indian Law Courts) as stamp vendors, law brokers, and ' stand ing witnesses' (these last-named gentlemen"], [140, "123 THE \"MiJNSIF.\" going about seeking what they might devour by way of payment for perjury!) as well as sellers of fruits and other eatables. Among the several groups of people we see under the trees in the Court-house ' com pound,' there is one particularly noticeable, being under the charge of an officer of the Court. They are the witnesses in a suit now under trial ; and are therefore, (pro bably at the request of one of the ' parties') placed under this restraint, to prevent their holding any communication with those of their number who have been already exa mined. We have our own grave doubts, however, how far this vigilance will secure the desired end. The ' officers of the Court' on whom such duties devolve are neither the best paid nor the most upright of Government employes : and a few rupees, or even annas very often suffice to induce one of them to permit, or at least to wink at, a witness being coached up in his part almost under the Judge's own nose."], [141, "THE \" MUNSIF.'' 124 Let us, however, watch the proceedings now going on in open Court. As we have said already, there is a case under trial ; and, as usual, the plaintiff and defendant are represented by one or more of the native lawyers (?) going by the designation of Vakil, and combining in the exercise of their professional (!) functions the duties of both the Attorney and the Barrister of the English bar \u2014 preparing a client's case out of Court, and pleading the same in Court. There is a decided ' family likeness' in the dress and general appearance of these Vakils . All of them wear the pagri (head-cloth) of white spotted dirty-red calico ; almost all of them, too\u00bb make use of spectacles of various antiquated designs ; and every one of them has his uttariyam (upper cloth) carefully folded narow and bound after the fashion of a girdle about the waist. This particular disposition of the apparel, we should mention, is a sign of great respect \u2014 worshippers, and even priests, in a Hindu temple, always approaching the image with"], [142, "THE \"MUNSIF.'' 125 their upper-cloth girt about the loins. All who have had any experience of this des- cription of our Courts in the Mofussil will, we assure, agree with us in thinking that a too great amount of noisy squabbling forms the chief feature in the conduct of cases by local Vakils ; but it must also be said, in justice to the class, and taking into consi- deration the comparatively novel and decid- edly disadvantageous circumstances under which they are called upon to plead and practice under a system of laws which has, to say the least, a very strong, if not a very large, foreign element in it, that they do very well indeed on the whole. There is also one other thing in their favor, and that is that almost every one of them dis plays a no inconsiderable amount of natural talent for the profession he follows, some of them being really worth listening to, and others exhibiting very remarkable powers of cross-examination. Hardly any of these Vakils grow English ; and they are, there fore, entirely dependent, for their kn\u00abw-"], [143, "THE \" MUNSIF.\" 126 ledge of existing laws, on the misty, next to-useless, translations into their vernacu lars of the various legislative enact ments.

We must, however, proceed with our depicturement of the scene before us. A witness, who has now been fairly through the ordeal of his examination, cross-exami nation, and re-examination, is having his by no means unprolix deposition read aloud to him by the Gumasta, of whom mention has been made already.

Every body else, however, is \" taking it easy.\" Some go out for a little fresh air or a drink of water, others to blow the nose or to take a pinch of snuff. This is also the time for the daldl (broker) to introduce a new client to the vakil for whom he touts, as well as for the client to say all that he has to his ' counsel' (!) about the points the coming witness must be questioned about. And so on, witness after witness comes, and wit ness after witness goes, with other bits of judicial work in the already mentioned \u00ab reading aloud' intervals till late in the evening, often long after lamp-light. Such is the Munsif, and such his official life and work.

And then, during the time of the Collector's jamdbandi (cir- cuit), the Sheristadar is an indispensable element in that \" Life in Camp and Cut- chery\" so ably, faithfully, and happily, de- picted by the late Colonel Meadows Taylor. It has been not unjustly remarked that a Sheristadar's duties depend almost entirely on \" Master's pleasure.\" We could easily"], [151, "PART IL] THE \" SHERISTADAR.\" 135 enumerate instances where, when either the Collector was particularly lazy, or the She ristadar particularly smart, the latter was made a perfect beast of burden of by the former ; but to go into details such as these, however interesting, if not instructive, would be too great a digression from the line we have chalked out for ourselves in professing to treat of the different aspects of Native life \u2014 would result in the intro duction of a great deal too much of the foreign element to justify the heading under which we now write.

Very few (if you except the crowd of gaping vakils that always congregate in the vici nity of a Collector's camp) know or see much of the Collector's Sheristadar in his official capacity ; but his brother in the District Court is differently situated.

Besides being held, in a general way, responsible for everything that may go wrong in the comparatively limited office attached to a District Court, the Sheristadar has to do the work of regis trar, interpreter, and judge's clerk. He has, that is to say, to affix his 'initials with date' to every paper that is presented in the course of business. He has to go through an amount of viva voce interpretation both during the examination of witnesses, and when the Court delivers j udgment or makes an order, which we for one feel sure we would very soon break down under ; and, last, though not least, he has to go care fully through every paper connected with matters coming on for disposal in Court, and make himself thoroughly familiar with the details of every case, not unfrequently having to draw up a full summary of such details for the convenience of the Judge, should that officer Dot take sufficient in terest in his work to allow of his studying"], [153, "PART II.] THE '' SHERISTADAR.\" 137 up each case for himself. And all this, the Sheristadar did, till lately, for only a hun dred rupees per mensem !

And now, ere we close, for a brief sketch of the Sheristadar himself. Our own ear liest recollections of this class of official dignitary were of a thin, small-made, man, with a complexion of a sickly pale shade of ' bamboo,' sparse moustache, an enormous hooked nose with huge spectacles balanced thereon, out of which glittered a pair of * Our Courts of Law, and \" How to improve thtm.\" By A.

Nor, in those times, were native officials provided with chairs and tables. Nothing like it. The Sheristadar and all his underlings sat cross-legged, (or reclined and dozed during the intervals of duty) on dindu tivdsi (carpet and cushions) with a ' sloping lidded box' on four diminutive legs in front to do duty for table, desk, and office box. Many a time do we recollect seeing the Sheristadar take a furtive pinch of snuff ' under cover' of this box when Master's back was turned, or his attention was engaged elsewhere.

The court-"], [167, "PART II.] THE SUB-MAGISTRATE. 151 house is nothing more or less than a veran- dah, or portion of one, with a room at one end for the placing of records.

Besides touting, and pettifogging, these gentlemen also not unfrequently undertake to procure evidence of any des cription \u2014 commonly oral, in the shape of false witnesses; and, on rare occasions, of course when there is a larger amount of gain, documentary evidence too, in the shape of antedated stamps, or neatly forged signatures. Such are the characters ordinarily met with in a Sub-Magistrate's Cutcherry in the Mofussil ; but let us turn our attention to the case which, as we noticed already, is now undergoing investigation.

The charge made, just now, by a member of one clique against perhaps a dozen or two of the members of the opposite faction is one of criminal trespass and assault ; and, as a matter of course, there are a perfect host of witnesses on either side to swear to their own particular version of the story. Cases of this kind, besides being of very frequent occurrence, also take up a great deal of time \u2014 sometimes going on for several days together \u2014 the vakils on both sides insisting, as only native Indian Mofussil vakils can insist, on every one of the witnesses they have cited being examin ed.

Without further preface let us introduce the reader to Madras Manikyam Mudaliyar, whose home life we are about to delineate. In the good old days of the ' Kumpani Bahadur,' Manikyam was a little boy ; and his father was, first a dubash, and then a writer in some office under the regime of those times. It was that period in the educational history of the country when, as we've heard our fathers tell, the man who could read the Arabian Nights in English (and understand it ?) was regarded as a pro digy of learning far superior to, or at all events much rarer than, the \" Bee Yea\" of our day. As he grew in years, Manikyam grew also in understanding; and, in due course of time, when his father retired on pension, he w"], [194, "178 [part II.

And then the old man died, leaving Manikyam and the other members of the family in the possession of a house and a decent hoard of money. The house Manikyam has en- larged ; and in it he lives. The \" family\" is a pretty large one, consisting not only of his wife and children, but also of the wives and children of his brothers, a wi- dowed sister, a maternal uncle, a paternal aunt, and a step-mother. Of the two younger brothers the elder is what is called among us an ' anonymous rice-eater' that is, one who eats the bread of idleness, but who is nevertheless about the most troublesome member of the family. The other brother is also in the \" writer\" line, being employed in a mercantile firm. The old uncle is, on the whole, an unobjectionable person ; and is an almost indispensable appendage in a large Hindu household being invaluable as an escort to the younger women when they go out, as well as a sort of guard on the"], [195, "179 PART II.] THE WRITER. house. Of the two old women, the step mother is the queen of the establishment, the directress-general of all domestic affairs, the dread, though by no means tho enemy of the younger women, especially her sons' wives. The other ancient female is a regu lar ' hewer of wood and drawer of water,' marketing and all similar outdoor duties devolving on her, as do cooking and other indoor work on the daughters-in-law of the family. The widowed daughter being her own mistress, and having been all along more or less of a pet with her brothers, is allowed to do pretty much as she pleases, sometimes going the length of acting in her mother's stead. Then, as to the children, such of them as are old enough, are sent to school, the younger ones remaining at home to run about naked, and to be alter nately slapped or petted by their elders.

The house is entered by a door of primitive design and dimensions, but coated with the wood-oil varnish of more modern times. Entering by a narrow passage, and turning to our left, we find our friend Manikyam standing at the door of the room whose windows look out on the street. The room is an addition of Manikyam's ; and, besides being the \"room\" par excellence of the house, is also his own special apartment combining bedroom, dressing-room, and study. Its contents are both numerous and varied.

It is the Over seer, too, that has to see whether the proper number of coolies are at work, and whether they each do the proper amount of ' task' that is allotted them. It is also the Overseer that has to certify as to measurements and other similar details to the higher officials.

Above the Range Officer there is the District Engineer ; and, above the District Engineer, again, is the Su perintending Engineer.

In the metropolis of our Presidency, where every ' district' has its Surgeon, and where hospitals, in common with all other public institutions, are, besides being competently superintended, always open to the inspec tion, frequent and unexpected, of the public, and the ' higher authorities,' the Dresser is never much more than a cross between a compounder and a sick nurse. In the Mufdsal, however, where the ' Nawab Saheb fashion' of doing things has not altogether ceased, and where there is neither press nor public to hold unprinci pled officers in check, you will find that the Dresser is often a very important personage indeed, often holding powers of enormous responsibility, and often, we regret to add, abusing those powers for carrying out the meanest and most ignoble of ends. Take, for instance, the case of one of"], [214, "198 [PART II. THE DRESSER. these Hospital Assistants attached to one of those institution flourishing at all our Collectorate stations under the grandilo quent title of a ' Civil Dispensary.' There is a small hospital in connection with this Dispensary, which is chiefly patronised by members of the Municipal police force on sick leave, a few bed ridden paupers, and an incurable or two. Over this establish ment, which is of course duly comple mented with kitchen, store-rooms and other out houses and appendages, does the Dresser reign supreme, except perhaps for the fifteen or twenty minutes during which (unless there is something very important, like a, post mortem examination, to be done) the Civil Surgeon of the District pays his daily morning visit to the place. And even then the Dresser is neither idle nor invisible ; on the contrary, he is even more prominent an actor on his little stage. It is not every member of Her Majesty's Indian Medical Service that commands a colloquial knowledge of the vernaculars of"], [215, "PART II.] 199 THE DRESSER. the country; and, so, in addition to the Dresser's other duties, that estimable indivi dual has to act as interpreter between the ' Doctor dorai' and any of the patients with whom his dorai-ship may hold a short conversation. After prescribing for some, or all, of the applicants for medical advice aud assistance, and perhaps signing a few papers, the ' Surgeon Saheb' will go home ; and, for the rest of the day \u2014 if, as we said already, nothing very emergent turns up \u2014 the Dresser reigns supreme. Behold him, therefore, as soon as ' master' is fairly out of sight, his jacket pulled off, his heavy ' head cloth' removed, thus enabling him, literally, to ' take it cool.' Lounging in a chair with his legs stretched out on the table before him, our Dresser now proceeds, or makes us believe that he now proceeds, to ' dis pense' the remedies prescribed by the doctor. On one side there is a large ugly looking chatli containing a strong infusion of senna leaves, hardly, if at all, touched up by its proper and usual accompaniment of"], [216, "[PART II. 200 THE DRESSER. epsom salts. A small tinpotful of this mixture is served out to each of the unfor tunate applicants for a purgative draught ; and great indeed is the Dresser's wrath (sometimes finding vent in language the reverse of polite) should any objection be made, or opposition raised, to swallowing the nauseous dose. After this, little chips of dressing-plaster, or rags dipped in carbolic oil, are distributed among those suffering from bruises, boils, or sores. Then, perhaps, there are a few prescriptions which the ignorant servant-of-all-work is unable to make up ; and, so, with no small amount of parade and ' tall talk,' does the Dresser's great self in person perform the business. Sometimes the patient is a very ignorant and credulous person ; and right earnestly does the Dresser set to work at ' gulling' the poor creature.

We happen to know that the child in question did get cured ; and that our Dresser-friend still enjoys a reputation for his ' charmed powder' in the locality ; but we question whether this is exactly the kind of way in which Dressers are expected to dispense drugs by the Government that has educated and employs them. Besides the ' Civil' one, there is also another Dis pensary at all large stations up country. We refer to that attached to the District Gaol; and, under the Civil Surgeon (who is most commonly also the Superintendent of the gaol), there is here also another Dresser, whom we shall find to be a greater personage even than his brother whom we have just described. Being placed over a whole lot of ' black sheep' in whose power it is not either to rebel or to reply, one common, though not necessary, consequence is that the 'Gaol Dresser' soon becomes hard- Z"], [218, "202 [PART II.

It has frequently been remarked, and not wholly without due and sufficient grounds, that a man in the position of a Dresser attached to a gaol is always in the fair way to make a fortune. Nothing, for instance, is easier than for such a Dresser to have a man put on lighter labor, or better diet, than that which falls ordinarily to the lot of the in carcerated felon ; and people would gladly and readily pay fifty, or even a hundred, rupees for such indulgences. Of course things like these do occur, as do many other evils in this wicked world ; and we mention them not to reflect upon, or to insinuate anything against, the Dresser as the representative of a class ; but because we feel it part of our duty to look at all sides of the question, and not to suppress anything simply because it is distasteful."], [219, "PART II.] 203 THE DRESSER.

Lastly, there are the Hospital Assistants whom we find in the military service, doing duty with a regiment.

We ought not to omit to mention, however, that in not a few stations praiseworthy and pretty successful attempts have been made, by way of flower plants and shrubbery, to alleviate this dreariness of appearance we have been speaking of; but, with all this, we do not suppose we are far from the truth when we say that, so far at least as neatness in appearance, and com fort or even convenience to passengers await ing a train, (leaving aside the more import ant point of provision for food and lodging,) is concerned, Indian Railway Stations are, if they are not a failure, certainly far from being a success."], [224, "208 THE RAILWAY STATION-MASTER.

He is empowered by Government to dispose of petty criminal cases (chiefly of theft), sentencing those proved guilty to fine, im prisonment, or both.

The heaviest part of his work, however, is that of writing \"re ports\" to his immediate superior, the Taha sildar ; and, unless he happens to be a pretty good penman, the Grama Munsif will only too often find himself getting into arrears; and thus into mischief. There is one more phase of his multifarious vocations which we must not omit men tioning, namely, the invaluable use he is of to travellers in procuring them food, lodgings, or relays of bullocks or carts. Of course he has his shortcomings ; and it is not unfrequently that, in spite of an order being sent days before for supplies or relays, not only are they not forthcoming, but the Munsif himself is invisible. But, making the usual allowances for the besetting in firmities of our countrymen, we should be the most ungrateful of mortals if we were not, on this occasion, to place on record the great obligations we have been under, both as travellers and as residents, to several members of the Grama Munsif class all over the Presidency. 1-B"], [234, "No. XL\u2014 THE \"GUMASTA.\" WE may begin by stating, for the information of such of our readers as are not familiar with the jargon of Native Indian official titles, that the term ' gumasta' (which, like the designations of several other characters we have dealt with in this series of papers, is of Persian origin) is applied to all employe's in the lower grades of the vernacular departments of the administration, whether clerks or account ants. In a country where employment under Government has long been looked upon as the chief, if not the only, means of acquiring honor, wealth, and in fact of distinguishing oneself, the Gumasta is always an eminently respectable personage, if he is not a very representative character.

We fear we cannot point to the average gumasta as a man of any great intellectual parts or proficiency ; nor can we, as a rule, accord him the doubtful reputation, at best, for knowledge that is claimed by a 'passed candidate;' but for plodding perseverance at the hardest of most hard work \u2014 that of quill-driving \u2014 for diligence and despatch (when he pleases) in getting through work, we do not believe the native Indian gumasta can be surpassed, if he is at all equalled. Of course there has been a good deal of early training at work"], [236, "220 THE \" GUMASTA.\" [part II. in making the gumasta so highly efficient a public servant as he is. Many of our Deputy Collectors and sub-Judges must recollect how their fathers or other relatives in office used to make them attend kacheri (office) immediately on quitting the ' house of bondage' presided over by that great bugbear of Hindu juvenile days, the pial schoolmaster ; how they were kept, often till late at night, to make out copies of de positions, or writing out a tdkid (order), or perhaps reading aloud an arzi (petition) ; and how what they must have felt most irksome at the time eventually gave them that familiarity with vernacular work of every description, to a woful want of which the ordinary Bee Yea and other productions of the ' high pressure' system of education in fashion at the present day must plead guilty, and which very materially stands in the way of their becoming useful members of the public service. Though there is no denying the fact that not a few of our fellow-countrymen who are now in high"], [237, "THE \" GUMASTA.\" PART II.] 221 situations rose from the comparatively in significant post of a gumasta, it must also be borne in mind that for everyone in such a position that is promoted, there are several hundreds that are left out in the cold, to live, grow old, and perhaps even die, as nothing more or less than a gumasta, which means hard work from morning to night, and poor pay, never exceeding twenty-five rupees a month, and often much less. Take, for example, the gentleman who is called the Head Gumasta of a Munsif's Court up country. He is registrar, judge's clerk, taxing officer, manager, accountant, and even sometimes interpreter and translator, all combined in one. Our only wonder is how a man who does all this, and so well as officials of this class commonly do their work, is content to receive only twenty rupees a month as pay, without any supple mentary emoluments whatever ; how, with the power in his hands to do almost any thing with the records of cases, involving, in"], [238, "THE \"GUMASTA.\" [part h. 222 not a few instances, interests and rights of incalculable importance, and with several other facilities for mischief-making, we say we simply wonder how the average Head Gumasta of a Munsif's Court is not only so hard working, but so honest, as we find him to be. These observations apply, with more or less force, to the gumastas both of the District Courts and of the Collectorate and subordinate revenue offices, all of whom are always exposed to a thousand and one temptations to tamper with the correct course of administration, whether judicial or revenue ; and, we repeat, it is indeed matter for self-congratulation that so large a number of our countrymen are, though placed in trying and even disadvantageous circumstances, generally found free from all taint of malpractices. Our description of the class gumasta would, however, be incomplete were we to omit making the reader acquainted with the fact that, as there are gumastas under"], [239, "PART II.] THE \" GUMASTA.\" 223 Government, so too there are gumastas in the service of private individuals and asso ciations. Go, for instance, into a javili or cloth bazaar. There you will find a burly, big, black Chetti reclining half naked among boxes and bundles containing fabrics different of kinds, from the costliest produc tions of the renowned looms of Benares or Madura, to the coarser textured green, red, or yellow selai (cloth), like the ones you find grass-cutter or scavenger women wear ing. Your first impression, of course, is that the Chetti is the owner of the property he exhibits for sale ; but, on enquiring, you will find that he is only a man in charge\u2014 a gumasta \u2014 a paid servant of some mer chant or trading firm. Then, too, there is the gumasta (secretary or steward) who is employed in every Hindu and Mahomedan household of any position or importance in the country. He is either superintendent of fields, gardens, or other landed property, a sort of steward or head servant in the domestic establishment, an agent, frequent-"], [240, "224 THE \" GUMASTA.\" [PART II. ly, for attending to law business in con- nexion with the collection of outstandings, or all these and even more combined. In the case, too, of the richer raiyats (farmers) most of whom are illiterate men, a gumasta is an indispensable adjunct for the carrying on of their business affairs generally, and correspondence, perhaps, particularly. Then there are the Gujirati and Marwadi bankers, known as Sahukar, in Madras, Bangalore, and other military stations and large towns in the interior. By far the great majority of these men are not only neither partners nor principals, but only paid agents \u2014 gumastas \u2014 of some great firm at Bombay or Benares, Haidarabad or the Hugli. Last, but not least, among the several varieties of the gumasta is the individual known as a ' law3rer's gumasta !' All members of the bar have, or are supposed to have, one or more of this description of employe about them. The gumasta of a lawyer is, as might be expected, a sort of factotum.

Such are the chief, if not the most inter esting elements and phases of Native Indian Life among the classes of people to whom the Gumasta belongs, and who, as we have said already, though neither very rich nor very high in position, nevertheless exercise an influence of a very good kind among the mass of the people, and are, certainly, a very important one among the several agencies now at work in securing for the British Government the most durable of holds on the admiration and affections of its Indian subjects. 1-c"], [242, "NO.

Thus it will be seen that the idea of a Munshi is always connected with the busi ness of reading and writing, and not un commonly also with that of teaching. For the purpose of the present paper, however, we propose taking the title Munshi, in one of its more limited, though perhaps most familiar, significations, that, namely, where it is used as applicable only to a teacher of Indian languages, sometimes to the foreign er, sometimes to the native youth. It would be no difficult, uninteresting, or un pleasant task for one to make a few remarks \u2014 as we even now feel sorely tempted to do \u2014 on the departed glories of Munshidom. We are doubtful if one out of ten thousand of our fellow-countrymen, of whatever caste or creed, has not heard, if he is not able to relate, at least one good story (with a Munshi for its hero) of the days of yore when the \" white man's\" rule was hardly"], [244, "228 THE \" MUNSHI.\" [PART II. known, if it had fairly commenced; and when the linguistical attainments of the great majority of these representatives of our rulers could be best defined by those happy lines of \" Aliph Cheem's\" \u2014 \" His Hindustani words were few\u2014 They could not well be fewer \u2014 As ' jaldijao,' and dekho do, And ' Khabardar' you suvvar !\" Our business is rather with the present than the past, however important and even interesting that past may be ; and we shall, therefore, confine ourselves just now to a description of the Munshi as he is, rather than as he was, or those who followed his calling were, about a century or seventy five years ago. The Munshi of the present day, then, is to be found pursuing his peculiar vocation in life either in the school-house, or at his gentleman (or lady) pupil's private resi dence. In the case of those who find em-"], [245, "PART II.] THE \" MUNSHI.\" 229 ployment in teaching the vernaculars to Europeans a knowledge of English (more or less good, bad, or indifferent) is, as a matter of course, an indispensable qualifi cation ; while the School Munshi is more of the ' rough diamond,' the more faithful prototype of the oriental conception of a pedagogue. We shall begin with a description of the School Munshi, the type of this class with which if we are not most familiar, we are at all events longest acquainted. In the earlier days of the Anglo-Indian system of education under which we live \u2014 before the University came, that is, to the rescue of the vernaculars \u2014 the ' Munshi's hour,' as we used to call it, was the hour for fun, frolic, and mischief, of every kind that could suggest itself to our fertile school-boy ima ginations ; and a percentage of fairly se venty-five out of the thrashings adminis tered by the head of the school were, we think, referable to a practical joke or some"], [246, "230 THE \" MUNSHI.\" [PART II. prank of the kind played during the verna cular hour. The Munshi himself was a comparatively harmless, very often a some what ancient, personage, his store of know ledge being perhaps as great as his almost utter inability to communicate it. Just now, however, things have changed vastly and for the better. The average School- Munshi is no longer simply a ' walking dictionary;' nor are his pupils so much inclined as school-boys were in former times to make fun of him ; and yet we question whether we take that intelligent interest in acquiring a knowledge of our vernaculars that might be reasonably expected of us, as we do also question whether the style in which the Munshi goes to work is the best for purposes other than merely securing a ' pass' in the Examination list. Let us beg the reader to accompany us to a class room where the Munshi is giving his lesson; and see how he performs that duty. The class is studying, say, a version of the Rd mdyana in Telugu verse. Well, one of the"], [247, "PART II.] THE \" MUNSHI.\" 231 pupils reads, or rather half sings, a stanza, the next goes through what is called pada vibhdgam, or the separating of the several compound words and eliminations in the stanza into their component parts. A third pupil now performs, with a peculiar sing song intonation, the process of substituting a synonymous word for each term that occurs in the stanza \u2014 often using expres sions like 'half-a-dozen' in (so-called) ex planation of simple words like ' six' ! And, then, lastly, there comes the tdtparyam (or purport) of the stanza, which, \u2014 having been committed to memory from notes of the learned Munshi's own exposition the previous day \u2014 is repeated with all the glib ness of a highly educated parrot ! Nothing like an attempt at teaching etymology or syntax from the text is made, other days being, as the Munshi will gravely inform you, set apart for the teaching of grammar ; while it is simply impossible for him, from his ignorance of English, to test his pupils' powers of translation. This, with the occa-"], [248, "232 THE \" MUNSHI.\" [PART II, sional submission to written examinations, is the way in which the more advanced pupils are taught (?) the vernaculars ; and we ask our readers to say whether or not \u2014 with agencies like these at work \u2014 we have any reason to cry out against the sad want of interest which educated Hindus display with reference to the literature of their own native tongues, leaving aside their lamentable ignorance of the same, compared with the knowledge they have of English. There is not a little, however, on the other hand, that can be said in favour of the class whom the Munshi is intended to represent ; and they have our sincerest sympathy in the mortification and pain of mind they must suffer in adapting them selves to the circumstances \u2014 so completely and fundamentally different from those under which their own minds have been trained \u2014 under which they are required to perform functions as toilsome and trying in"], [249, "PART II.] THE \"MUNSHI.\" 233 their execution, as they aro important and incommutable in their results. We must also bear in mind that the Munshi is about the poorest paid member of the teaching staff in any school or college ; and, as a friend of ours put it, ' how much brains can you expect for ten or fifteen rupees a month, when you pay twenty-five pagodas (87 rupees and a half) for the use of a bar rister's brains for perhaps only an hour or so ?\" So that, taking him as a whole, we have not much reason to be dissatisfied with the Munshi ; while there can be no doubt whatever that, so long at least as the better educated classes of our community will not put themselves to the trouble of mastering their vernaculars, sufficiently to allow of their becoming teachers of those languages themselves, it is impossible for us to find any one better able to fill his place.

With his flowing robes of white, his placid physiognomy, and not unfrequently a book and an umbrella under his arm, lurking perhaps in the veranda, or under a tree opposite the bedroom window, the \" Moonshee\" isa feature familiar enough in Anglo-Indian life. As we have said al ready the private Munshi, if he is at all worth being employed, is very fairly ac quainted with English \u2014 in fact his very work itself affords him peculiar facilities for acquiring a capital knowledge of at least colloquul English; and then he enjoys that crowning advantage, namely, an apt, and industrious pupil. Thus it will appear that the Hues have fallen to the private Munshi in pleasanter places than they have to his brother who has to do harder work and for less pay in the school.

These, briefly, are the commonest aspects of Native Indian Life among a class of our countrymen who form a pretty noticeable element in Hindu Society at large- and who, to give them something, more than a 'negative recommendation,' exercise a very considerable amount of influence of a very good kind on their community in general, if not on their pupils in particular."], [252, "No. XIII.-THE \"SAHUKAR.\" THIS is the name by which the profes- sional money-lender is best known in all parts of India.

More or less, however, Sahukar is known as the proper designation for the Indian ' Shylock/ as he is often called in the descriptions given of him by Anglo-Indian writers.

And then, too, we must take into consi deration the fact that, without the aid of the Sahukar, it is seldom if ever that the average raiyat can get on. After paying his rents, taxes, and other claims, there is hardly enough left for the maintenance of himself and household throughout the year.

Whether or not these people are all remark able for any peculiar elongation or curva ture of the particular portion of the face referred to, we are, of course, unable to say; but we have not the slightest hesitation, whatever, in saying that the 'speech' of the Native Christian catechist always and un failingly ' bewrayeth' him to any but the most perfect stranger to India and Indian men and manners. As we said already the catechist is a sort of cross between the street-preacher and the school-master. We shall, therefore, beg the reader to follow us in thought to some of the scenes of his labors. As we ride along one of our bazaar streets of an evening, our attention is drawn to a crowd of people Collected around a man who, standing on slightly elevated ground, is vociferating at the very top of his voice. It is the cate-"], [291, "PART III.] THE CATECHIST. 273 chist preaching. Close to him, on either side, are three or four juvenile members of the congregation over which the catechist exercises a sort of official visitor's powers. The youngsters are there to assist in con vening an out-door audience for the cate chist. This they do by singing a hymn, or reciting aloud passages from the Bible, or some Christian lyric in the vernaculars ; while, just as often, the catechist himself commences operations by reading aloud a tract or chapter from some book or another. As soon as a sufficient number of people are collected \u2014 and proceedings of the kind we have just described seldom fail to col lect people in this country\u2014 the business of preaching proper begins. We wish, for the sake of Christianity itself in the abstract, as well as for the sake of that particular section of the Hindu community to which the catechist (in common with several per sons for whom, as gentlemen, and as men of learning and liberal views, we have the highest respect) belongs, we wish, we repeat, l-i"], [292, "[PART III. 274 THE CATECHIST. we could say that the catechist's way of doing his work \u2014 and, which is worse, the way in which he is allowed, and even encouraged, to do it\u2014 was} if not the best, at least unob jectionable. We regret to say that, if we would be true, we cannot but characterise his ' line of procedure' as positively absurd, and, at times, invidious and even insulting. Of course, we do not, for a moment, wish to go into the religious bearings of the ques tion. All that we would say\u2014 even at the risk of being accused of travelling beyond our legitimate limits, and of incurring the displeasure of those in whose estimation we would fain stand high\u2014 is that it is as ill adapted to take with the natives of this country, as it never can be successful to any considerable extent. Just listen to what the catechist is saying. He holds a copy of the New Testament in his hands; but very little that comes from his lips is in keeping with the spirit and teaching of that volume. A great deal of the catechist's (so called) sermon is the most vulgar abuse"], [293, "PART III.] 275 THE CATECHIST. of Hindu deities and sectarian prejudices ; while just as much of it is anecdote, fable, and proverb by way chiefly of illustration. Now, though no great admirers ourselves of Hindu deities, nor staunch supporters of Hindu caste-prejudices, we think it nothing but proper that some respect should be paid to the feelings of those who do believe in those deities, and who do keep up those prejudices. Besides, when \u2014 as is most frequently the case \u2014 the catechist himself is (or was) of a much lower caste than the bulk of his hearers, it is, to say the least, not particularly pleasing to have caste cried down and made fun of. Well, in due course, the catechist's ' preaching' is over. A prayer may be offered up ; and, perhaps, a hymn sung ; while, after distributing a few tracts, the catechist and his juvenile assist ants will trudge home, the former making mental calculations, most probably, as to the number of people he ought to put down in his \" Report Book\" as having been preached to on this occasion ; the latter with their"], [294, "276 THE CATECHIST.

And now, let us go into a mission school room(probably in a missionary's compound); and see the catechist at work in his capacity of pedagogue. The scene is dull and un interesting enough in all conscience; but it is quite in keeping with the catechist's ideas of duty. Far different from his repre sentative among the non-Christian native population, the pial schoolmaster, you will always find the catechist on his feet, hard at work, determined to teach what little he may know to his scholars ; and to see that they learn it, One advantage he has is that the subjects which he teaches are those which, and which alone, he himself studies con amore. With all that, however, it is neither the easiest nor the pleasantest of tasks to keep a whole lot of dirty, mis chievous, little urchins in order and at work, in addition to other duties equally, if not more, difficult of accomplishment."], [295, "PART III.] 277 THE CATECHIST. Before we close, let us pay a brief and hurried visit to the catechist's own home. It is also, very probably, within the already mentioned precincts of the padre's com pound ; and, for the credit of the Native Christian class, we must say it will compare very favorably indeed with the homes of those with similar means (and of the same caste) among non-Christian natives. The women and girls of the family, besides being able to cook and sew, are also fairly educated in their own vernaculars, and manage to deport themselves a great deal more sensibly and dignifiedly than their unchristianised sisters. There is also a certain air of quiet comfort that is only con spicuous by its absence in the too great majority of Indian homes, not even except ing those whose inmates belong to the ultra- Anglicised fraternity.

We should state, however, that the epithet under notice is used, as we now use it, in a somewhat limited sense, as applicable, that is only to such natives of this country as have been to England and back. So much has been said on this subject, by so many different authorities, in so many English papers, and from so many different (English) points of view, that it may not, we imagine, be considered either out of place, or uninteresting, for us to let people see this particular specimen of the human race through a pair of native Indian spec tacles \u2014 to represent the 'travelled Hindu' from the point of view held by the vast majority of his untravelled fellow-country men. It may also be as well for us to state that we do not go with those who object to the visit to England per se, whether it be one of business or pleasure ; but we do certainly think the practice, unfortunately becoming common every day, of adopting foreign cus toms and manners to the utter exclusion of our own simpler and more suitable ones \u2014"], [299, "PART III.] THE 'TRAVELLED HINDU.' 281 in a word, the consummate folly of over- Anglicising ourselves \u2014 is one against which it is impossible to speak in terms too strong, as it is one not only supremely ridiculous, but even ruinous to our prospects of nation al advancement. Without further preface, we may proceed to say that, as there are different types of the same stock to be met with in the animal and vegetable creation, so too, there are different types of the particular class whose collective designation we have chosen as the title of this paper. There is, for instance, Mrs. Mary Joseph (as she dearly loves to hear herself called,) a devout mem ber, of longstanding, of a certain establish ment in India. In her younger days Mrs. J. was known by the name (far more fami liar to Hindu ears than her present one) of Adi Lakshmi : and was a not bad-looking dya (child's maid) in the service of the Mis sionary at 'our station' in the mofussil. \u00ab Her uaturally intelligent mind,\" we quote 1\u00abJ"], [300, "282 THE ' TRAVELLED HINDU.'

She is now the matron, we believe, of a Girls' Boarding School ; and we have more than once had the privilege of listen ing to her conducting what she called ' meeteen' (Anglice, meeting) one part of the proceeding being the singing of a certain revivalist hymn. Mrs. Joseph also occasional ly introduces certain very sensible changes in her costume, such as the putting on of a thick pair of boots in cold or wet weather, not omitting to pull on a woollen night cap over her head and ears before she retires to rest every night. Then, there is our friend Ramasami, with whom, we fancy, some at least of our Anglo-Indian readers must be familiar. He"], [301, "PART III.] THE 'TRAVELLED HINDU.' 283 is another personage to whom the term ' travelled Hindu' might strictly be ap plied ; for he has been to England also, in his professional capacity (of cook or body servant) along with some Anglo-Indian Bahadur, on the latter's final return home ; and he holds not a few testimonials speak ing of his character in terms of the highest praise. You will be simply overpowered if you just ask him one question regarding his English experiences, so ready and willing is he to hold forth on particulars connected with what there can be no doubt has been the greatest event of his life. We might also name our other friend, the Revd. Mr. Rangasami, as a third individual whom we might class under the ' travelled Hindu' heading. It is true he did not go to England (or Scotland, we forget which) as a ' delegate' from Missions here, any more than he travelled thither as ' boy' or bearer to his Missionary superior ; nor did he do much, if anything, by way"], [302, "THE 'TRAVELLED HHIDU.' [PART III. 284 of taking such audiences by storm as assemble at Exeter Hall or similar arenas ; but still he has been across the 'black water* ; and his predilection for England and English things generally is as sincere and strong, as it is of the most undisguised character. None, however, of the three people we have mentioned come up to our idea of the travelled Hindu par excellence; because, though there is no doubt they have travelled, they are not very representative characters ; nor does their influence extend or make itself felt to any degree of importance. The kind of travelled Hindu to whom we purpose confining our remarks on the present occasion is a very different person, every way, from Mrs. JOSEPH, or Messrs. Ramasami and Rangasami. His visit to England has been at a time and under cir cumstances wherein he could see not a little, and judge for himself a good deal ; and, moreover, has extended over a pretty con-"], [303, "PART III.] THE 'TRAVELLED HINDU.' 285 siderable period \u2014 so considerable a period indeed as to metamorphose him into an Englishman in everything except the color of his skin.

But, we ask, how did our travelled friend feel when he first tasted English cooking or first wore English costume ? Surely it must be easier to revert to the habits one has been used to for years, and which fit in perfectly with such circumstances as birth, position, and climate, than to keep on to habits but recently acquired, and acquired only in adapting oneself to a foreign and particu larly trying situation of a very temporary character ? Our travelled Hindu friends, however, we regret to observe, think other wise. At all events it looks, if we are to judge of them by their deeds, as if they think otherwise. Nothing with them can at all approach excellence, not to say per fection, that is not English ; while, on the other hand, everything native that should commend itself to them on the ground of early association (if no other) is looked upon"], [305, "PART III.] THE 'TRAVELLED HINDU.' 287 as ' coarse,' ' vulgar,' or perhaps ' barbar ous'! Let us, however, pay our ' travelled Hindu' a visit at his house. You will have no great difficulty in finding it ; for he takes as good care that it is in a fashionable (i.e., European-peopled) locality, as he does to have a signboard up with his name at the gate. Some time after your card has been taken in, you will probably get an invi tation to come into the 'office-room' \u2014 ' master' (whose master ?) evidently not be ing sure whether your visit is one of business or of compliment. The first question, therefore, which you will probably be asked when he makes his appearance will be that most annoyingly impertinent one which not a few Anglo-Indians are so used to put \u2014 \" Well, Sir, what can I do for you ?\" should you disabuse his mind of any notion that may there exist of his being able to do any thing for you, he will probably apologise ; or, at all events, relax considerably ; and, if you at all come up to his notion of a per-"], [306, "288 THE 'TRAVELLED HINDU.'

Should you be ' somebody,' there will also be the chance of an introduction to his wife, who, if she is not a ' travelled' lady herself, is one most strongly and unmistake ably Anglicised. Sooner or later the con versation will turn upon England, proba bly every article of ornament in the room is a 'direct importation' from ' that glorious, wonderful, country'; and there may also hang tales neither few nor short, to each such memento. See how eloquent our tra velled countryman will wax as he dilates on the ' countless benefits' and ' incalcula ble advantages' that he believes will result from a visit to England ; and mark how gravely he will put his hand on your shoul ders as he closes with the words, \" My dear fellow, take my advice, and send your boy off to England as soon as you can possibly manage it. There's nothing like it.\" If, however, you wish to see the ' travel-"], [307, "PART III.] THE ' TRAVELLED HINDU.' 289 led Hindu' at his best, you must do so on the occasion that he entertains his Euro pean or ' ultra- Anglicised' friends at his ' Lodge' (or whatever may be the absurdly English name he may give his dwelling house). See how complacently and self satisfiedly he bowsand smiles as he displays himself most elaborately (and, we have no doubt, most uncomfortably,) got up in a ' swallow tail,' white ' choker ;' and other component elements of what he will tell you, with a faint half-pitying smile at your own ignorance, is costume de riguer for an evening party ! We fear we put him out considerably when we told him that black, while a ' gentlemanly color' (if colors are to be chosen according to their descent, should it be settled they have such a thing) enough for a ' white man,' looked simply horrid when worn by one of his (our ' tra velled' friend's) complexion, as we did when we suggested, amiably enough, that he should do something to get rid of the holes in his ears (which every Hindu has 1-K"], [308, "290 THE ' TRAVELLED HINDU.'

Well, as we talk, the guests begin to arrive. They include a few typical Europeans, the family doctor (for it won't do for one who has been to England to be without an expen sive attache of this kind to his establish ment,) with an attorney, as much to have all the professions represented, as out of cour tesy to that particular profession which by far the great majority of travelled Hindus (in this Presidency at least) belong to. These, with a few travelled (or other wise highly Anglicised) natives are the persons whom you will meet ; and it is a sight worth seeing, certainly ' as good as a play,' how our ' travelled Hindu' friend will go to work ' handing' his lady guests out of their carriages, and ' leading' them within doors. Verily would the ghost of our good old Manu shudder could he but see a descendant of those for whom he"], [309, "PART III.] THE ' TRAVELLED HINDU.' 291 framed his 'code' thus aping perhaps the most incongruous, and even (to the popular native mind) indecorous, manners and cus toms of the mUchcha (foreigner), pollution from the least contact with whom, accord ing to his (Manu's) laws, could only be removed by cutting off so much of the body as had been touched by the unclean being ! In due course, however, the several guests are ushered in ; and presently, there will, most probably, be a division amongst them as to billiards or croquet ; for our ' travelled Hindu' is an adept with the mallet, as well as the ' cue.' According to English ideas, so at least we are obliged to suppose from what we see, it would seem that neither of these games can go on without certain stimulants unto the playing thereof in the shape of iced (and intoxicating ?) drinks- Hence.wefinda table laid out in the verandah with such delicacies (?) as ham-sandwiches and claret cup, side by side with cakes and confections of a more homely make, whose outlandish and unpronounceable names we"], [310, "292 THE 'TRAVELLED HINDU.'

One of the 'would-be British' ladies presides over another table, playing at making tea or coffee; and even, perhaps, indulging in a ' mild flirtation' to complete the Englishism of the whole scene. We sorely wish space would allow of our recording a few dialogues from the conversation going on. They would make the very flesh creep of those Indophiles with whom a residence in Eng land is looked upon as the only means for reforming the Hindu character and the Hindu people. In our humble opinion it is a reformation indeed, and one with a ven geance ; but certainly far from being the kind of reformation that a patriot or a philanthropist would desire for his country. We are, however, digressing. From billi ards, croquet, and the verandah tables, the step is but a short and an easy one to the drawing room, whither the company will remain till dinner is formally announced (by a Pariah butler ?). That announcement duly over, and the guests having paired off"], [311, "PART III.] THE ' TRAVELLED HINDU.' 293 dining-room wards, let us take a brief and hurried glance at some of them as they are seated around the travelled Hindu's '' hos pitable mahogany\" ! The host himself we have already described, at least we have described how he dresses. To his right is a young Englishwoman the guest par excel lence of the evening. She came out, we think, in the same steamer that her present host returned to India, to be engaged in educational work ; but has given that up for a much snugger little berth up the Coonoor way, she being, in short, engaged to be married to a coffee-planter, who is also among the present company. Next to this lady's espoused husband (who, of course, sits by her) is a native lady of the ultra-Anglicised school, one, that is, who is a Hindu in nothing more than color and by the accident of birth. Of tolerably fair intelligence, and very cre ditable industry, she does not conceal that she is a bit of a blue-stocking; while it is a truth only too painfully self-evident"], [312, "294 THE ' TRAVELLED HINDU.'

Opposite her is her representative in the ruder sex \u2014 the ultra- Anglicised Hindu young gentleman. He is a raw young lad yet in the lower regions of the College, but eagerly awaiting the time when he is to be shipped off to England to compete for an appointment in the Covenanted Civil Service. He too dresses, talks, and generally behaves as a young Englishman of his age, as do all the others of his class, with this important excep tion, that, whereas the Englishman does now and then give a thought to the masses around him, the travelled Hindu, and those of his countrymen with whom he associates, so far from thinking of, and feeling for, and trying to improve,their less-favored brethren do their very best by word and by deed to keep themselves as far aloof as possible from others, from what cause or with what profit we will not undertake to say."], [313, "PART III.] THE ' TRAVELLED HINDU.' 295 We could easily go on multiplying ins tances of the several remaining types of the travelled Hindu confraternity ; but we re frain, as much for fear of trespassing on the manor of personalities, as from the sadden ing, sickening, nature of the subject itself. We wish we could, with truth, have drawn a brighter picture, and have exhibit ed our travelled fellow-countryman in a light more favorable than that which we have just represented him in. We wish, we repeat, we had it in our power to say that by far the great majority of such natives of this Presidency as we know who had visited England were persons of known and acknowledged good principles ; and that, as much as in them lay, they were anxious to promote the good of their fellow-beings.
