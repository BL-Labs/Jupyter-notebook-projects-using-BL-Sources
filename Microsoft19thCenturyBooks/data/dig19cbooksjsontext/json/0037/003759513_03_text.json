The excitement of old Joshua had been toned down amongst the wax-lights and pleasant faces around the Ashtons' well spread supper-table, and at first he was disposed to be conversable after his own peculiar manner. They had purposely avoided Shude-Hill Market by an ample circuit ; but stragglers of both sexes from the scene of riot lay maundering or asleep in their path, or crossed it at every turn, in all stages of inebriation and disorder ; until the natural irritability of the chaplain (increased by failing health) broke forth in loud-voiced indignation, ending in a wail"], [11, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 3 that he was \" getting old and powerless,\" or he would \" rise like another John Knox, and denounce the wickedness rampant in the land.\" \" A good man lives there, Jabez,\" said he, pointing to the black and white home of the head master, where lighted windows told of hospitality awake, \" a good man, but for whom I should not be alive to tell you; but there are those in the pulpit, my lads, whom the Church ought to spew out, lest they poison the flocks it is their duty to feed.

Ghosts indeed ! It had like to have been haunted by ghosts of some thing more than old times, as Jabez and I know to our cost. I've never been right since the young ruffians had me in their clutches ! And mark you, my lads, and think of it when you have young ones of your own to rear : there's no worse sign for a country or a family than when the young jibe and jeer, mock and scorn their elders. \"When grey hairs fail to command respect, virtue, principle, and religion are at their lowest ebb.\""], [13, "5 THE MANCHESTER MAN.

See you steer clear of brawls, and give drunken fools a wide berth.\" Leaving the young men so abruptly dis missed to retrace their steps towards Hyde's Cross, it may be as well if we throw a light on some of Parson Brookes's dark allusions. Time had not smoothed the old man's eccentricities, nor modified the an tagonism between the Grammar School boys and the ex-master. They were always at war, and there never was wanting a casus belli. The previous September he had been more than usually irritated by a lampoon which began \u2014 \" O Jotty, you dog, Your house we well know Is headquarters of prog \" the purport of which was to fix on him the"], [14, "6 THE MANCHESTER MAN. stigma of inviting a friend to dine, and regaling him with a black-pudding only. Lashed to fury, he burst into the Gram mar School when the first and second-form boys were assembled in the afternoon to rehearse the speeches which, according to custom, they were to deliver in public at the annual commemoration in October. He braved them in his hottest style, winding up with, \" You are a set of block heads ! I would not come to hear your speeches if you would pay me for it !\" There was a general cry, \" Turn him out ! Turn him out !\" But Jotty would not be turned out. He stuck himself in the doorway with his legs against the door post, and his back against the door itself, to the extreme risk of broken limbs, whilst his young and vigorous opponents brought their strength to bear upon the door to force him out. \"With such odds he was sure to be overcome ; but, driven into the j'ard, he"], [15, "7 THE MANCHESTER MAN. fought with his antagonists like a mastiff at bay, and they, like the cowards they must have been, to have assailed in a body an old man (under any provocation), by sheer force of numbers, bore him backwards to the wall, and, but for the opportune arrival of Dr. Smith, would have repeated the outrage perpetrated on Jabez Clegg eight years before. He might well say Dr. Smith had saved his life. Such a fall, whether in high or low water, to so old a man, would have been certain destruction. They broke his heart, I think, if they did not break his limbs, for he never was the same man afterwards. Even old Mrs. Clowes used to rally him on his frequent \" fits of the dumps.\" Whether Jabez and Ben Travis had, or had not, lost sight of the Parson's homily, they were linked arm in arm, the rich yeomanry officer and the unpretending smallware-salesman, just as. nearly nine"], [16, "8 THE MANCHESTER MAN. years previously, the big, raw-boned youth, with a heart large enough to match his frame, had linked his arm in that of the poor Blue-coat boy, as a friend and pro tector, when as yet his admittance into society was undreamed of. Where the four roads met at Hyde's Cross, a staggering Charlie (as the watch men were called, much as, at this day, they are Bobbies) passed them, with his horn lantern and staff, and his rattle in his belt, proclaiming \u2014 \"Past ten o'clock! (hiccup). \"And a foine moonleet neet ! \" The two stood for a moment ; then, animated by a desire to ascertain if Joshua Brookes had spoken sooth, or, in his spleen exaggerated, they turned up Shude hill, all alive with people who were ordi narily at that hour in bed, and made their way to the market.

Hogarth's print of \" Gin Lane \" was feeble beside it. The distribu tion of food was over, but that of drink continued.

Children, men, and women, their clothes torn or disarrayed, lay singly, or in groups, on the paths, or in the gutters, asleep or awake, drunk, sick, helpless, exposed ; there was fighting and cursing over the ale yet procurable ; there were loaves in the gutters, and meat trampled in the mire ; food which, properly distributed, would have gladdened many a poor, hard working family, too self-respecting to join that clamorous mob."], [18, "10 THE MANCHESTER MAN. The two young men turned away sick and disgusted. \" Henry Hunt, in advocating the disuse of excisable liquors,\" said Jabez, thought fully, \".may only have designed to cripple the Government ; but surely no one could witness scenes like these, whether \"Whig or Tory, without feeling that some restric tion on drink is absolutely necessary for the safety of the State and the comfort of the people.\" \"You are right, Mr. Clegg,\" responded Travis, heartily. \" Men of all politics ought to meet on this ground. I shall see how far my little influence goes to check intemperance henceforth. Something must be done, and that promptly.\" \" Whatever I can do to second you, you may depend on, though beyond our own warehouse my opportunities are small,\" said Jabez ; \" still, if I can influence one within our walls, that one may act on two outside, and so we may prevail in the end.\""], [19, "11 THE MANCHESTER MAN. \"Yes,\" added Travis, \"and if this night be not eloquent in its protest against drink, all humanity must be equally debased and brutalised.\" Some caution had been necessary to cross the Market, so as to avoid insult, the captain's bulk and uniform rendering him conspicuous, and his corps being in anything but good odour. They had kept well with in the shade of the pillared piazza which extended along the side to their right, and, stunned by the uproar of brawling and fighting crowds, picked their way between degraded humanity in heaps on the pave ment, crushed hats and bonnets, torn caps and shawls, boots and shoes which had done duty as drinking vessels, sodden meat and bread, and had much ado to avoid splashing through puddles of ale and other abominations. They had emerged into Oak Street, glad to have got tolerably clear of the clamour and brutality, when a cry from the direction of Tib Street,"], [20, "12 THE MANCHESTER MAN. \" \"Watch ! help ! watch !\" fell on their ears in tones which had a strangely familiar ring to Jabez. Hastening on at a run, they came upon a decently dressed man struggling against three or four drunken ruffians with heavy clogs on their feet. They had got the man down, and were vociferating with oaths not to be repeated here. \" Gi'e him a lick wi' thi clog !\" \" Punce him well!\" \"Shut up his tater-trap fur him !\" \" Purr him i' th' bread-basket !\" \" Fettle his mug wi' thi clog !\" Before Jabez and his companion could prevent it, a heavy thud, followed by a groan, told of a brutal kick ; the two only dashed among them in time to arrest the other clogs, already on the backward swing for force ; and saved the prostrate man by turning the fury of the savages on themselves.

Most thankful was Jabez for the impulse which had directed their steps that way when, on raising the fallen man, the light of an adjacent oil-lamp projecting from the wall fell on his blood-stained face, and revealed Tom Hulme, who had been drawn into that unusually disorderly neighbour hood by like curiosity with their own, and been set upon without provocation. Ho walked with pain, and they supported his steps to the Infirmary, not finding Mr. Huertley, on whom they called, at home. But so fertile had that evening been of serious injuries, he was some time before he could obtain attention. Thirteen far more urgent cases had preceded his.

It was, however, not much of a laughing matter to Tom Hulme, or to loving Bess, who looked aghast at this deplorable ter mination of a day's jollity. Nor was there a trace of mirth on the face of Jabez when at parting with Ben Travis on the Mosley Street door-step, he gripped, more in pain than pleasure, the big hand extended so cordially. It was after midnight, but from the open windows of the still lighted drawing-"], [23, "15 THE MANCHESTER MAN. room the thin quick ears of Jabez had caught the sound of Augusta's melodious voice blending with that of Laurence As pinall in a popular duet, although the notes of the latter were neither so clear nor so steady as they might have been. The pallor on her foster-son's face Bess at tributed to tender-hearted sympathy for her injured husband ; but Jabez hurried away from her oppressive thanks to the solitude of his own chamber, where he could bury his face in his quivering hands, and unseen wrestle with emotions of which she had no conception. Never had he known a day so che quered. The same sun which had looked down at noontide on the triumph of his amateur brush, had beamed on Augusta Ashton's conscious cheeks, as she accepted his rival's familiar act of gallantry without so much as a frown.

She had put her small white hand within his, and blessed him with a word or two of shy recognition ; but Laurence Aspinall had again come like a cloud between him and his sunbeam ; her sweetest smiles, her softest tones, were for the intruder ; her arm had rested willingly on his, her voice had blent with his in sentimental song, and darkness once more shut out hope from Jabez. \" Common sense might have taught me that my love was folly, presumption, mad ness!\" he argued with himself; \"that the heiress of a wealthy man would not stoop to her father's Blue-coat apprentice. But oh !\" he groaned, \" I had hoped to raise myself step by step nearer to her level \u2014 to make myself worthy of her as a man, if I had not riches to lay at her feet.

His reverie was broken into by the tread of many feet on the staircase below, and the murmur of voices calling one to another; the hall-door shut with a clang, and then a light foot came tripping up the stair alone, and from heart and lips dropped uncon- sciously the soft refrain of that too well known duet.

Then he murmured half audibly, \"If he were only worthy of her I could bear it better ; but to see her cast her heart at the feet of one who will trample on it, is beyond mortal endurance.\" He started to his feet. A bright thought irradiated his face. \" Coward that I am ! I am quitting the battle without striking a blow. I am my self unworthy of Augusta if I surrender her to a heartless profligate without an effort to save her.

Courage, Jabez ! \"Work with a will : do your duty.

BIRDS OF A FEATHER. nnHE Palace Inn on the north side of \u25a0*- Market Street Lane was the last relic of that cramped thoroughfare to disappear at the bidding of Improvement. Possibly because its many eyes and bald dark-red brick face looked out on a space so much beyond the twenty-one yards assigned by Act of Parliament to the regenerated street that the improvement committee had no powers to meddle with it, for surely its historic associations were not sufficient to protect it.

Alas ! Clio and all her sister Muses must succumb when Mammon is on the march ! But Mammon had only got his first foot in the street on that Thursday morning in July, which blushed at the doings of the Coronation night, and the Palace Inn yet held its head high as beseemed its historic state.

That Coronation day had much to answer for. When Tom Hulme should have risen at four o'clock to return home, his bruised limbs were so stiff and sore that the soldier, who had borne the fatigue of many a campaign, who had bivouacked on the battle-field after a forced march, and been ready with the sun for the day's duties, had to confess himself \" fettled \" by Lancashire clogs, and unable to stir. There was no alternative but to acquaint Mr. Ashton."], [32, "24 THE MANCHESTER MAN. The mill could not be left without a man- ager. After the night's unwonted dissipation, Mr. Ashton slept heavily, and was with difficulty roused. When once he compre hended the state of affairs, he was on the alert. \" It's a bad business !\" said he to his wife as he dressed in haste. \" There is nothing so bad, but it might be worse,\" was her consolatory reply. \" Never bewail a loss till you have done your best to repair it. Can you not send Mr. Clegg to Whaley-Bridge for a few days ?\" \"My dear, your counsel is invaluable, but I fear there is not time to catch the coach ; it is twenty minutes past four now.\" \" It is sure to be late this morning, and Jabez will catch it if it is to be caught,\" was her quick rejoinder. Bess had already awakened Jabez, and he, fully dressed, met Mr. Ashton at his bed-"], [33, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 25 room door with \" Can I be of any service, sir ?\" A prompt commentary on Mrs. Ashton's declaration. A few necessaries hastily crammed into a carpet bag ; a bowl of milk and a crust of bread as hastily swallowed ; and Jabez, accompanied by Mr. Ashton, was on his way to the Palace coach-office confident they were in time, not having heard the guard's bugle, or met the coach. There was, however, barely time to claim for Mr. Clegg the place already booked for \" Mr. Hulme\" (Mrs. Hulme's seat was forfeited), and for him to take his seat, before they were off in a canter, and Mr. Ashton's business mind was relieved. As the manufacturer, satisfied that the mill-hands at Whaley-Bridge would not be left altogether to their own devices, stood within a short distance of the high steps looking after the vanishing coach, a party of roisterers came swaggering out of the inn, hallooing with all their tipsy might.

Naturally Mr. Ashton, his brief reverie disturbed, stooped to pick up the fallen beaver, and making due allowance for the unwonted occasion, turned to remonstrate good-hum ouredly with an excited stranger who had evidently drunk the king's health too frequently.

Not one of the four was in a condition to recognise him, although two of them, John Walmsley and Laurence Aspinall, had supped overnight at his own table ; although the third, Kit Townley, had good reason for remembrance, and Ned Barret was anything but a stranger. Loud laughter hailed the fall of the hat. A second attempt to \" uncover the obstinate old fogey\" was made, but dexterously avoided by Mr. Ashton in his absolute astonishment stepping backward beyond range. \" Young gentlemen, do you know whom you are insulting?\" There was another laughing chorus. Aspinall almost toppled over the rail as he leaned forward, impotently striking out with his whip. \" I protest the old rad's demnibly li \u2014 ike the lovely Augusta's snuffy old dad,\" drawled out he, in a sort of tipsy wisdom."], [36, "28 THE MANCHESTER MAN. \"Just so!\" appended Walmsley, mimick ing the old gentleman's peculiarity. Mr. Ashton, though a reasonably temperate man himself, was not so greatly shocked at these young carousers as Ave might be. Long usage blunts sensibilities. It was a glorious distinction to be a three bottle man ; the inability to drink a solitary bottle of wine at a sitting was a sort of dis qualification for good-fellowship ; and it was considered a fine thing for a boy of seven to \" toss off a glass like a man ;\" so the genial old gentleman was inclined to allow some latitude for the special occasion. But they had touched him on a tender point. The light mention of his darling daughter's name roused his blood. \"John Walmsley,\" he cried angrily, looking up, \" what brings you, a married man, with these young rakes at this hour \u25a0of the morning ?\" \"Pray wha-at brought y-you here, old"], [37, "29 THE MANCHESTER MAN. fogey?\" hiccoughed Aspinall, answering for the other.

His irritation half emptied his snuff-box before he got home, so often he tapped smartly on its golden lid, and so often his finger and thumb travelled between it and his nose with a touch of ruminant displeasure. Neither he nor Mrs. Ashton was disposed to overlook the fact that Kit Townley and Ned Barret \u2014 scapegraces by repute \u2014 were"], [38, "30 THE MANCHESTER MAN. of the party, nor that Augusta's name had been familiarly used in their midst. \" ' Birds of a feather flock together,' ' said the lady ; \" and if Mr. Aspinall's son associates with that reckless and dishonest Kit Townley, he is a very unfit friend for John Walmsley, and still worse for our dear Augusta.\" \"Just so; for a dashing blade with a handsome face, who sports a uniform, talks poetry, and sings sentimental songs, is just the fellow to take a silly girl's fancy, before she is old enough to think.

Such a construction of the gallant officer's salute had not occurred to her, and native delicacy took alarm. Mrs. Ashton continued to pour out her thoughts along with the coffee. It was fit Augusta should know her sentiments on this head. \" It would have been a breach of hospi tality to resent it before our friends, and not good policy either. But I shall put a stop to his visits henceforth.\" \" Oh ! mamma,\" exclaimed Augusta, dropping her hands at this climax, \"you cannot mean that !\" \" Yes, my dear, I do.

She paused as she was taking her dry toast from the silver rack, and half-hesitatingly remonstrated. \" Of course I should not wish to associate with Mr. Townley's friends. But papa may be mistaken. I do not think Mr. Aspinall would mix with them. People meet and mingle at coach-offices who are strangers.\" \" Just so, my dear ; but \" interposed her father. \" Why, mamma,\" the persistent young lady went on, \" no more perfect gentleman enters our doors than Mr. Laurence Aspinall. His manners are most refined. Then he talks enchantingly, and sings divinely.

I shall have a word with them on the subject. I called in Marsden Square on my way home, and found Charlotte with red eyes. John had not been home all night.\" And Mr. Ashton battered the top of an egg whilst delivering what he regarded as a crushing argument. Breakfast and the discussion were un usually prolonged, the only impression left on the yonng lady's romantic, impressible, and inexperienced mind being that her parents were unaccountably harsh to her, and unjust to Mr. Laurence, in her eyes the beau-ideal of a man. Such a figure and such a face could only enshrine divinity. And if he was a little wild, so were all heroes at his age. Let not the inexperienced young girl be over-much condemned for this.

The door in Mosley Street was closed against Mr. Laurence Aspinall, and James was in corruptible. But the teaching of Miss Bohanna's library being that Love was far-seeing and parents were blind, it followed that Miss Augusta (who would have resented any supposition of wilful disobedience or intentional dis respect towards the good father and mother she loved so dearly) met the fascinating gentleman (always by chance) either at her cousin's in Marsden Square or in her walks abroad, and scented biflet-doux came and went between the leaves of four-volumed romances, which Cicily carried to and from the library.

They had travelled inside, but John Loudon Mac-Adam had not yet been appointed \"Surveyor of Roads,\" and Tom Hulme had suffered severely from the jolting of the coach.

Old Simon, who seemed to have got a new lease of life from the invigorating country air and occupation, had already breakfasted, and was in the bean- field gathering the first ripe pods for a dinner of beans and bacon. \"Eh, Turn, lad !\" said he, as he entered the house-place, and saw his son-in-law's pale face against the blue-and-white check cover of the arm-chair, \"whoi, thi feace is as whoite as a clout !

But Tom Hulme had received unsuspected internal injuries, and many weeks went by before he was stout as before \u2014 weeks preg nant with fate for Jabez ; and not Jabez alone.

In the pine-woods, alone with nature, he could give vent to his emotions, or indulge in meditation at his will. Mr. Ashton, however, found him other occupation for his spare hours. The landlord of the \" White Hart,\" bearing in mind that Mr. Clegg had come under his roof first as a travelling artist, had expatiated to Mr. Ashton with much pathos on the deplorable condition of the inn sign, not without sundry broad hints that Mr. Clegg's temporary residence on the spot was a glorious oppor tunity not to be neglected. Mr. Ashton had smiled, said \" Just so,\" taken a pinch from the immense snuff-box lying on the bar parlour chimneypiece, then fallen back upon his own, gone away, and forgot the dingy"], [47, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 39 sign altogether, until another hint from his tenant refreshed his memory. As he stood at the inn door waiting for the Manchester coach, au upward sly glance of the jolly host's caused him to say to the young man by his side, \" Do you think you could manage to paint a new sign for the ' White Hart,' to oblige Chapman and me ?\" Jabez hesitated, not from unwillingness. \" I'm afraid, sir, to attempt. It's not in my line, and \" \" Oh ! you can do it well enough. Re member the banner.\" \"I've no materials here, sir, else \" If that's all, you shall have them in a day or two.\" In a few days an easel, a new sign-board, and colours were sent by the Manchester and Buxton carrier, and Jabez set to work to the especial wonder and admiration of little Sim, who delighted to stand by his side, and grew rebellious when \"bed-time\" was announced. Jabez was, however, but an"], [48, "40 THE MANCHESTER MAN. untaught artist, and his painting hours were few; the couchant hart was rubbed in and wiped out over and over again before he was satisfied even with the outline ; but then it grew in fair proportion under his brush, until he felt there was something in him beyond the region of tapes and braces. The graceful animal, resplendent in golden collar and chain, looked mildly out from the easel in the parlour nearest to the passage (used, when the family was there, as an eating room), and little Sim gravely reported to his elders it only wanted \" gass, an' tee, an' ky,\" when the inmates of Carr Cottage were startled by the arrival of unexpected visitors. It was the second week in August ; the air was heavy with the perfume of clove carnations, honeysuckle, mignonette, laven der, musk, and mint. Golden sunflower and crimson hollyhock were in their glory ; bees and wasps hovered over balsams and China asters, or hid themselves in the blue"], [49, "41 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Canterbury bells or the amber nectary of the stately white lily. Fruits were ripe for the gatherer, grain was falling under the sickle. Bess, in a fair white muslin cap, a large check apron over her dark chocolate and-white print gown (her blue bed-gown days were over), was moving quietly about the house-place, preparing their early breakfast, no longer restricted to oatmeal porridge. Tom, looking worn, but clean and neat as loving hands could make him, leaned back in his soft arm-chair, and watched her with well-satisfied eyes. Little Sim was already iu the garden with his grandfather, helping to pick raspberries and currants for preserving. The tall oak-cased clock struck seven, and then, true to time, the guard's bugle announced the coming of the coach from Manchester. Instinctively Bess went to the door, as was her wont, when the coach"], [50, "42 THE MANCHESTER MAN. came in. She uttered an exclamation of surprise. \" Eh, Turn ! aw declare t' coach is stoppin' at ar gate! Happen theere's a parcel or summat for ar Jabez.\" And off she set past the kitchen window and the farm-yard Gothic doorway, and down the avenue, with the light foot of a younger woman. Before she reached the avenue gate, the stuffy vehicle had yielded up three ladies and two bandboxes, and the guard having unlocked the capacious boot (a kind of closet at the back), dragged thence, with much superfluous puffing and straining, two hair trunks of moderate dimensions. Yes, there stood Mrs. Ashton, grandly calm ; bright-haired Augusta, tall, slim, and, it must be added, unamiably silent ; and Ellen Chadwick, whose black eyes had an absolute glow of expectancy in their depths. Bess put up her hand in amazement. \" Eh ! Mrs. Ashton, madam ! Yo' han"], [51, "43 THE MANCHESTER MAN. taken us unawares !

Just then little Sim came back with Joe \u2014 his most particular friend, to whom he was chief patron \u2014 a drivelling idiot, a man in frame, a child in heart and brain. He was a pitiable object, the scoff of the rabble, but he had sense enough to know his protectors. At the instance of the four-years-old child, he shouldered the box with a vacant chuckle ; and Sim, loaded with an oval pasteboard bandbox half as big as himself, waddled after him as fast as his deformity would permit."], [53, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 45 Before the travellers could reach the top of the avenue Jabez Clegg was with them, the other trunk upon his shoulder. He had heard at the \" White Hart \" of their arrival, and had almost sacrificed the dignity of his position in his desire to run. There were more greetings, accompanied by a cordial shaking of hands ; and Bess and Simon looking on saw with pleasure, not unmixed with pain, that the foundling they had adopted and reared had mounted far above their heads, albeit in rising he had drawn them up too. He breakfasted not with them in the house-place, but with the new-comers in the parlour; and Bess herself waited upon them, Meg, her little maid, being off in the harvest field gleaning for a bed-ridden mother. She heard him conversing freely, if deferentially, with the lofty Mrs. Ashton on topics and in a language her provincial tongue could never compass. She saw him turn to answer the arch sallies of Miss Ash-"], [54, "46 THE MANCHESTER MAN. ton, and the quieter observations of Miss Chadwick, and noted that the dark eyes of the latter kindled when he spoke, and her cheeks had a warmer glow, as if they caught their hue from the flushed face of Jabez. Breakfast over \u2014 little Sim had sat on the door-step to share his with Crazy Joe, \u2014 whilst Ellen and Augusta retired to unpack, \u2014 Mrs. Ashton graciously accepted the escort of Mr. Clegg to the mill, and they trod the avenue and the high-road side by side, dis cussing business matters, her dignity losing no whit by the companionship. Mrs. Ashton was one of those who can lift up without stooping. Clouds never lingered on Augusta's face ; she had been transported thither, as she said, \" with no more ceremony than a bale of twist,\" but she put off her displeasure with her travelling bonnet, and danced into the kitchen airily as a sylph, to help Bess out of the quandary caused by their advent. \" I am afraid our arrival has been very"], [55, "47 THE MANCHESTER MAN. inauspicious,\" Augusta said, \" but I can assure you I was not consulted, and am not to blame \" (she had certainly not been con sulted \u2014 blame was another matter). \" And now what can I do for you, Mrs. Hulme ?\" Augusta tucked up the sleeves of her peach-coloured gingham dress, borrowed a linen apron from Bess, who confessed to being \" rayther a heavy hond at paste,\" and soon the matron was at ease respecting pies, and tarts and custards. Simon Clegg brought in a dish of trout fresh from the stream ; the larder supplied savoury ham and eggs, the garden furnished peas ; so Mrs. Ashton was not far wrong. It was but a spurt on Augusta's part ; her tender impressionable heart had melted at Mrs. Hulme's first look of dismay, but, the impulse over, there was no more tucking up of sleeves or handling of paste pins. For tunately for their digestion, Ellen Chadwick had no less skill, since, quiet as she was, she seemed to lack an outlet for superabundant"], [56, "48 THE MANCHESTER MAN. energy, and, obtrusively restless, helped Bess she hardly knew how, or how much. Augusta wandered about cottage and garden, or sat for hours under the shade of the great sycamore tree, singing low-voiced plaintive ditties; feeling herself the most ill-used and wretched being in existence, separated from her adorable lover ; and the more she brooded, the more discontented and melancholy she became. It was all very real and very much to be deplored. No knife cuts so keenly at the heart-strings as the sharp edge of a first love turned in upon itself; and Augusta was as much in love as ever was maiden of seventeen. Mrs. Ashton went daily to the mill, but a casual remark of Mrs. Hulme's on \" Miss Ashton's mopin' an' malancholy \" aroused the attention of the energetic mother, and she did her best to counteract morbid fancies with long sharp walks in the early morning (extending, on one occasion, as far as Shawcross Hall, where she astonished"], [57, "49 THE MANCHESTER MAN. her relatives by an informal visit), and a repetition of the dose in the evening, when Mr. Clegg made one of the party, thus un consciously adding fuel to the fires which, unknown to her, consumed alike her niece and her warehouseman. At the end of ten days, Mrs. Ashton returned to Manchester, leaving the girls behind. She had extorted a promise from Augusta that she would not write to Mr. Laurence Aspinall, and relied on that pro mise being faithfully kept. Moreover, after some debate with herself, as they walked from the mill together on the last afternoon of her stay, she committed her daughter and niece to Jabez Clegg's care. \" You are a very young man for so important a charge,\" she said, \" but you are steady as old Time, and of your integrity and fidelity we have had many proofs.

He had no more clue to Mrs. Ashton's hidden meaning than she to his secret emotions. It had been wiser to have been more explicit. Without that charge he might have made it a point of honour, if not of duty, to hold aloof from the young ladies lest he should be obtrusive : as it was, the more he pondered, the more"], [59, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 51 he became satisfied that it was only a deli cate way of giving sanction to a companion ship he might otherwise have regarded as presumptuous. Accordingly, he constituted himself their cavalier after business hours, fulfilling to the letter his instructions to endeavour to amuse Augusta whenever he found her drooping, well rewarded if he could win back a smile or a peal of the rippling laughter he had heard so oft in her school-girl days. His attentions to Miss Chadwick were tinctured with the profoundest respect, but there was no effort to entertain or be agreeable ; on the contrary, it was Miss Chadwick who kept the light shafts of her cousin's wit within bounds when they were likely to wound \u2014 as they did some times.

Then Jabez resumed his brush, Sim clapped his thin little hands with delight, whilst the sedate young lady of twenty-four, and the bewitching damsel of sweet seventeen, varied the monotony of piano, book, or em broidery-frame, with an occasional criticism of his work. It was a time fraught with intoxicating delight, but of terrible temptation to Jabez. The frequent fits of languor which bowed Augusta down like a drooping lily, made her only more dangerously dear to him, and it needed all his strength to remember that she was his master's daughter, and confided to his care. If he now thought of Laurence As pinall and his fascination, it was only as a butterfly beau, for whom no sensible maiden could entertain a permanent liking. Not even when, turning back one forenoon for something in the closet which he had for gotten, he found her in tears on the low ledge of the open window at the foot of the staircase."], [61, "53 THE MANCHESTER MAN. \" Good heavens, Miss Ashton, what is the matter ?

Can I do anything to serve you? I would lay my life down to save you from pain ;\" and the earnest tenderness of his voice spoke volumes. She had subdued her emotion. Gather ing herself up with a reflex of her mother's stateliness, she said haughtily, \" It is no thing, sir ; I am better,\" and swept past him up the staircase, leaving him to set his teeth and turn away with clenched hands, alike"], [62, "54 THE MANCHESTER MAN. exasperated at his own loss of self-command and grieved for her grief. On the narrow landing which ran parallel with the staircase like a balcony, Augusta found her cousin Ellen, with one hand on her side, leaning against the chamber door post, as if for support, with closed eyes and pale lips. She had been \" overcome by the heat \" \u2014 so she said."], [63, "55 CHAPTER IV. THE LOVERS' WALK. TABEZ held a responsible post, and had \" no more leisure than other business men for emotional indulgence. He hurried out of the cottage, and down the avenue, shutting up his bitter feelings within the doors of his heart as he went. But the process closed his eyes and ears to external sounds, and the old postman, with his long tin horn, which had been echoing through the straggling village a full quarter of an hour, passed him in the avenue and said, \" Good day,\" without so much as arresting his attention. At the mill he found letters waiting \u2014 one, which had been post-paid as a double"], [64, "56 THE MANCHESTER MAN. letter, conspicuous amongst the wafered business communications, not only because of its thick, gilt-edged paper, and crimson disk of crested wax, but from its curious folding, as if to baffle prying eyes. It was signed \" Ben Travis,\" and was so long, it went into a pantaloon pocket, to be read when his multifarious duties allowed him more leisure. When the hands were dismissed at noon, and the one clerk had left the counting house, he took out the voluminous epistle, which was dated September 10th, and cer tainly found therein matter of interest. Amongst a few preliminary items of news, he learned that the excesses of the Corona tion night had created so much disgust in the minds of thinking men that many of those who had denounced Henry Hunt's advocacy of abstinence, and at the public expense had formerly disseminated priuted laudations of good brown ale, the \"old English beverage,\" as \"a cheering and"], [65, "57 THE MANCHESTER MAN. strengthening drink,\" no longer branded the water-drinkers as \" enemies to the corporeal constitution of Englishmen,\" but had given their countenance to social gatherings whence intoxicating liquors were excluded. Travis himself was doing what he could to promote these temperate meetings, and looked for the earnest co-operation of Mr. Clegg on his return to Manchester. (And he did not look in vain ; though neither of the young social reformers saw in advance how univer sal would become the temperance movement of which this was the unpretending pre cursor.) The letter went on to say \u2014 \" Miss Chadwick and her fair cousin were spirited away mysteriously. At first I blamed myself as the unhappy cause.

I wish cor respondents would be more explicit !\" He pondered over this sentence, but could make nothing of it, and after reading a little way, came to the real object of the letter, prefaced as it was with much circumlocu tion. \" It may seem strange that a great, big, burly fellow like myself should be such a booby as to seek the intervention of a third person in an affair of the heart.

Do not despise me, Clegg : neither Samson nor Hercules was any stronger. I cannot resign myself to that verdict. I would throw myself again at Ellen's feet, and beseech her pity, but that I dread its repetition. Can I count on your good offices to move her in my behalf?

Mr. Travis had been his firm, true friend, in spite of difference in position and fortune. He had overlooked that difference from the first, but would Miss Chadwick, his employer's niece, overlook it, if he stepped beyond privileged bounds? From the depths of his own conscious heart he felt for his friend, but how to approach so delicate a subject to serve him was perplexing. He never thought of shirking the trust. It was late when he got home to dinner. Ellen and Bess were both on the look-out for him. He quickened his pace, fearing some evil to his beloved Augusta, whom he had last seen in tears. \" What an anomaly is woman !\" he thought, as he found her fingers rattling over the keys of her piano in accompaniment to the merriest dittj' he had heard from her lips since she was a child."], [69, "61 THE MANCHESTER MAN. There was a strange sparkle in her eyes, a vivacity in her manner so opposed to her sadness that he asked himself if he had been dreaming before, or was dreaming then. She blushed over her willow-pattern plate as she took her seat, but, after that first token of susceptibility, chatted with a volubility unusual to her, and curiously in contradiction to the silence and reserve of Ellen Chadwick. In the morning he had debated whether that secret trouble came within the category of \" unusual \" things Mrs. Ashton required to be informed of, and, behold ! it was gone ! She rallied both Jabez and Ellen on their gravity, and at length, as if on a sudden inspiration, asked, playing with her green-handled, two-pronged fork \u2014 \" Shall you be very busy at the mill this afternoon, Mr. Clegg?\" It was an unusual question. He an swered : \" Rather. Some bales of twist have"], [70, "62 THE MANCHESTER MAN. come in from Messrs. Evans, of Darley- Abbey Mills. I must see them unpacked, and compare the twist with samples. But \u2014 your motive for asking?\" \" Oh, if\" you are busy Well, perhaps after tea will be better ; it will be cooler. I wish you would just take Ellen a good long walk; I found her fainting with the heat this morning.\" Ellen coloured vividly. \"Augusta!\" she remonstrated. \" And yourself, Miss Ashton ?\" questioned he. \" Oh, I have a heap of clear-starching to do. My frills and laces are in a woeful plight. I shall be clap-clap-clap all the afternoon, and this sultry weather prohibits ironing until there is a cool evening breeze to fan me through the window. Without it I should be as likely to faint as Ellen.\" Miss Chadwick made light of her faintness, and objected, if not too strenuously, to be so disposed of; but Augusta, in her old"], [71, "63 THE MANCHESTER MAN. wilful way, insisted, and Jabez, with his friend's letter on his mind, was not likely to throw opposition in the way. So, notwith standing his recent rebuff, he was once more \" Miss. Ashton's humble servant to command.\" After an early tea, which was but a fiction to all three, Augusta was left behiud, busy with a box-iron and her ladylike laundry of lace and muslin in the house place, whilst Ellen Chadwick and Jabez went rambling with the winding waters of the translucent Goyt, under umbrageous trees on pleasant mountain slopes, where foxgloves nodded, and horse-tail grasses bent before them, and only an occasional reaper or gleaner crossed their path. Had these two been incipient lovers, no more embarrassing silence could have fallen upon them. If Jabez, her junior by two years, had had a tussle to keep his love within bounds, there had at least been a glimmer of hope in the distance, and the"], [72, "64 THE MANCHESTER MAN. struggle was upwards. Ellen had been trained from her childhood to keep her naturally strong feelings under control ; but there was a war in her breast between maidenly shame and unsought, hopeless love, and the two hacked at each other and at her heart in the rayless dark, and the struggle was downwards. Here she was, for the first time, alone with the man she loved with all the strength of a strong heart, with the newly-gained knowledge that he \" would die to save her cousin pain ;\" and he, conscious of a sacred and delicate mission, all unaware of her secret love for himself, was perplexed how best to approach the subject, and take ad vantage of the opportunity so afforded him. At length \u2014 \" I had a letter from my friend, Captain Travis, to-day,\" he began. With little perceptible emotion, she re plied, \" Indeed ! I hope he was in good health."], [73, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 65 You are honoured in your friendship, sir. Mr. Travis is a noble gentleman, and 1 esteem him highlv.\" This paved the way for him to expatiate on Ben Travis's many good qualities. He told the story of the big, raw-boned youth's first patronage of himself, and fouud an attentive listener as he traced the growth of their friendship upwards, and related favour able anecdotes which have no place in this history. But no sooner did he begin to plead his friend's cause with all the warmth of young friendship than her manner entirely changed. Her colour came and went; she panted as if for breath, and gasping out, \" Oh \u2014 h ! Mr. Clegg, for mercy's sake, don't \u2014 don't !\" was seized with a sudden faintness for the second time that day. A lichen-covered old tree-trunk, shattered and uptorn in the late thunder-storms, was at hand ; he seated her upon it, bringing water to revive her from a runnel near ; but any attempt to renew the subject only seemed VOL.

The evening shadows were fast closing in when they reached the cottage ; and she, with a simple inclination of the head, left Jabez on the threshold, and passing through the parlours, carried her overmastering emo tions upwards to her room, to be grappled with in the silence of the night. \"Wheere's Miss Ashton?\" asked Bess. \" Hoo said it wur too hot to bide i' th' heawse an' hoo put her irons deawn, an' ester titti vatin' hersel' oop a bit, went eawt a-seekin' yo'.\" In some surprise, not unmixed with alarm,"], [75, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 67 for the hour was late\u2014 as times and country went\u2014 and the harvest brought rough stran gers into the neighbourhood, Jabez set off at full speed down the avenue, and ere he had reached the first brook, saw her lithe figure advancing buoyantly ; and, if his eyes and the gathering mist did not deceive him, a second figure parted from her at the gate. She was the first to speak. \" Whichever way did you people ramble off?\" \" Oh, down by the Goyt, Taxal way, Miss Ashton,\" answered Jabez. \" Ah ! and I went up the Buxton Road ; we were certain to miss.\" \" I thought I saw you part from some one at the gate ? Could I be mistaken ?\" half questioned her interlocutor. \" Oh, Crazy Joe ! that was all !\" and he took her reply in all sincerity, not believing Augusta Ashton capable of untruth.

She was given to snatch up her hat and \"run out into the garden for a breath of fresh air,\" but she generally came in panting as if the \"run\" had been literal; and sometimes she would be found in the house when supposed out of it, and vice versa. The White Hart had not yet walked away, although Jabez considered it com plete. It waited Mr. Ashton's coming and his verdict, and stood on the easel in the dining-room."], [77, "69 THE MANCHESTER MAN. The morning post had brought a message to Simon Clegg concerning fruit and vege tables for the Manchester home, and having sought him in the kitchen-garden to deliver it, Jabez entered the house at dinner time by the lower staircase window (frequently used for entrance and exit). His pas sage through the best parlour was arrested by voices in the room beyond, one of which he knew too well. It was that of Laurence Aspinall. His painting was evi dently under free criticism, and had been for some time. There was some jesting at the sign-painter. \" You see, Miss Ashton, what a few touches can effect !\" The speaker had apparently made free with Clegg's colours and brushes, and there was a murmured sound of assent from Miss Ashton. \" Well, Barret, Nee scire fas est omnia; Ne sutor ultra crepidam. What say you ?\" \" Yes ; let the cobbler stick to his last."], [78, "70 THE MANCHESTER MAN. If this Clegg would be an artist, let him stick to his brush ; if a tradesman, let him stick to his trade. If a man means to succeed he must never flirt with either art or trade. It's just as bad as wooing two women at once.\" Jabez heard no more. The blow which had been aimed at his art-pretensions drove him back by the way he came, and he placed the long terrace parallel with the \" Lovers' Walk \" for fully half-an-hour. When he turned the corner of the cottage, and went in at the front door, the critics were gone, but Aspinall's \" few touches \" remained. They had indeed given life to the White Hart. Henceforth the \" cobbler \" resolved to \" stick to his last !\" Ellen Chadwick had been away, with little Sim by the hand, to take some sub stantial comforts to Meg's bedridden mother.

Her evident displeasure set Jabez wondering"], [79, "71 THE MANCHESTER MAN. what Travis meant by \" after what has occurred,\" and he wrote that afternoon for enlightenment, sending his letter as a packet by coach, there being no second post. It has been said that the cellarage of the cottage was only accessible by flights of steps in the portion of the weed-grown Lovers' Walk which lay at the windowless back of the long low building, where nettles grew so thick and rank that even the square unused trap over one set of steps was half hidden by them. The path was rarely used, the farmer having made a nearer cut from the farmyard to his ancient dwelling. Tom Hulme was slowly recovering, under the care of a Buxton doctor who came thrice a week. He could walk about the garden with a stick, but there was no sending him to the dank cellar for anything. The doctor had ordered him port wine, and Bess, who kept the key, had asked Mr. Clegg to fetch a couple of bottles from the cellar."], [80, "72 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Tea was over, but he fancied there was sufficient light to guide him without a lan tern. He had got the wine and was approaching the cellar door at the foot of the sunken steps when he heard the sound of voices coming along the walk from the direction of the moor. Every pulse in his body seemed to grow still as he recognised the tones of Augusta Ashton and Laurence Aspinall, and heard with deepening anguish the unmistakable sound of kisses interchanged. They had apparently paused close to the stair-head for that embrace ; and then he heard \u2014 and thanked God that he was there to hear, though that hearing blighted every hope he had \u2014 his rival, with every argument which passionate love or skilful sophistry could employ, persuade her to elope with him the following night. Backwards and forwards they walked in the gathering dusk, but never beyond the length of the premises ; and now and then"], [81, "73 THE MANCHESTER MAN. they stopped, and drove him mad with their caresses. The place was so retired and lonely, precaution was neglected ; and Jabez, chained to the spot as it were, gathered that proposals for her hand, made by Laurence himself, had been peremptorily rejected by Mr. Ashton, who was set down as a despot and a tyrant for refusing to surrender a silly girl of seventeen to a rake of two-and twenty. He heard her tell that Jabez Clegg had found her sobbing at the separa tion, even whilst her darling's letter was at the gates. And he heard it said that the elder Aspinall not only countenanced this secret courtship, but had furnished funds for the proposed elopement. This generosity \u25a0was set against the cruelty of her own parents ; her affection, her pride, the romance in her nature were appealed to, but still Augusta's better angel held her safe, until, coward that he was, Laurence terrified her with a threat to \" blow his brains out \" if she refused him."], [82, "74 THE MANCHESTER MAN. She wept her assent upon his breast, and then Jabez, already half-stunned, heard the details of evidently previously concocted arrangements for their elopement and mar riage at Gretna Green, professedly with his father's sanction."], [83, "10 CHAPTER V.

In 1821 the village of Gretna Green, on the Scottish border, was the general resort of runaway lovers, who, being in their minority, could not be married legally in England without parental consent, whereas in. Caledonia a mere promise to marry made in the presence of witnesses was held bind ing. At Gretna a man not in holy orders, but metaphorically called \"the blacksmith,\" because he riveted the chains of matrimony, lived in the first house beyond the bridge which spanned the river Sark, and, with a ceremonial as unseemly as it was brief, married all comers, often with pursuers at his very doors ; and the marriages so con tracted were not to be set aside. For more than half a century Gretna Green weddings had figured largely in the literature of the stage and of the circulating library ; and there is no doubt that the halo of romance"], [85, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 77 thrown around an elopement to Gretna blinded to the impropriety of the prenuptial flight many a foolish or headstrong girl whom the actual ceremony shocked and startled. Augusta Ashton, with all her sentimental romance, all her petulant wilfulness, all her resentment at being exiled from home and her Adonis, yet loved her parents well, although her reverence and filial obedience had been gradually undermined by the plausible sophistry and impassioned elo quence of her ardent lover. But if she loved them much, she, unfortunately, loved Laurence more. He was, to do him justice, terribly in earnest ; and in the inexperience of her seventeen years she could not be expected 'to sift and analyse that passionate earnestness for its many components.

What did Jabez think, seeing that he did know ? Think ? He scarcely could think. Feeling seemed to overpowe*r thought, reason, perception. When after a stagnant time he emerged from the stair-head, it was more as a culprit than Jabez Clegg. He put down the bottles and escaped again into the open air, cowed alike by the knowledge"], [87, "79 THE MANCHESTER MAN. which had overpowered him, and by a sense of dishonour at having played the unworthy part of listener, albeit the listening had been involuntary, seeing that the shock of his discovery had stunned him like a blow from a sledge-hammer, crushing his own long cherished hopes to death. His next thought was of intense thankfulness that by any means the schemes of Aspinall had been bared to him, and in time to attempt the rescue of his idolised Augusta from the clutches of a villain. Unacquainted with the events which had preceded Augusta's removal to Carr \u2014 unaware that the Mosley Street doors had been closed against Laurence, or that a formal proposal for the young lady's hand had been made by the elder Aspinall on behalf of his son, and peremptorily declined by the Ashtons ; ignorant that imperious Mr. Aspinall, in his gouty wrath, had sworn \" upon his honour \" that his son should \" marry the girl in spite of the paltry"], [88, "80 THE MANCHESTER MAN. beggar's-inkle-weaver,\" and having no faith in the man himself, Jabez regarded the use of the father's name only as a proof of his greater perfidy, and gave him no credit even for an honourable intention or an honest emotion. The time was past for Clegg to find excuses for the wrong-doing of his adversary. Now, with every nerve unstrung, he was required to act, and that promptly. To morrow would be too late. What if he should take Miss Chadwick into his confi dence? But no, he could not lower Augusta in the eyes even of her own cousin ; and neither she nor anyone there had authority to detain Miss Ashton against her will even if her foot were on the step of the post-chaise. It was imperative that he should reach Manchester immediately, yet how to do so without exciting alarm perplexed him. There was a horse in the stable at the mill, but as he had a bed in Simon's room, aud could neither leave it nor"], [89, "81 THE MANCHESTER MAN. return to it in the night without passing through the Hulmes' sleeping apartment, there was a difficulty in quitting the house unknown. \" I must be at the mill before daybreak to-morrow having something of importance to attend to, so I will sleep on the squab in the house-place, Mrs. Hulrae, and if I am not in for breakfast, do not wait for me,\" said he ; and no one questioned him, although Mrs. Hulme and her husband were .of joint opinion that \" Jabez looked terribly put eawt,\" and wondered what business he could have on hand of so much consequence. No one thought of locking country cottage doors. By nine o'clock all the inmates were in bed and asleep. Before ten Jabez, sad at heart, had quietly left the cottage for the mill, had saddled Peveril, and, though no great horseman, was speeding past the \" White Hart \" along the highway to Manchester, fast as the steady-going roadster would travel. The wind had risen, G VOL.

Nevertheless as he turned from Piccadilly into Mosley Street, the muffled-up old watch man, catching the echoes of the Infirmary clock, bawled out, to mark his own vigilance, \" Just one o'clock, an' a dark rainy neet !\" and the Ashton household had closed its eyelids, and its account with the day, at least a couple of hours. It is never pleasant to be the bearer of ill-tidinsrs, so no wonder Jabez hesitated with the lion-headed knocker in his hand,"], [91, "83 THE MANCHESTER MAN. ere he sent its reverberations growling through the silent house. His hesitation must have influenced the knocker, for the lion had to roar again, and louder, before he heard the window above unclose, and saw Mr. Ashton's night-capped head thrust out, to ask, in alarm, \" Who's there ? What's the matter?\" Jabez stepped back to the kerbstone to let the dull rays of an oil lamp fall upon his face. \" It is I, Jabez Clegg, sir ; I have a matter of importance to communicate.\" \"Good heavens, Clegg, you ! Surely the mill's not been burned down ?\" \" No, sir, all's right at the factory. There's no harm done anywhere at present. If you will please to come down, I hope there may be time to prevent that which is threatened.\" \" Just so, I'll be down directly.\" There were no lucifer-matches with which to procure instantaneous light, but during this brief colloquy, Mrs. Ashton had been g2"], [92, "84 THE MANCHESTER MAN. groping on the tall chimney-piece for their precursors the Prometheans, and having found them, by dipping a small chemically prepared match into a tiny bottle of fluid, she obtained a light as soon as the window was closed and the draught shut out. Too uneasy to waste much time in dress ing, before many minutes had flown, Mr. and Mrs. Ashton, whose fears had equally pointed to their daughter \u2014 the one in a roquelaure, and the other in her warehouse overall \u2014 were both listening with agitated and anxious faces to Mr. Clegg's communica tion, made with a discomposure great as their own. \" Elope !\" both parents exclaimed, simul taneously. \" Elope !\" reiterated the mother ; \" our daughter consent to elope, and with a reprobate like him ? It is not possible !\" \"So I should have said, madam, yester day,\" rejoined Jabez sadly, as he sank on a chair, overpowered more by the strain on"], [93, "THE MANCHESTER JEAN. 85 his feelings than by the fatigue of his long, wet, midnight ride; \"and I would have given the world to have been able to doubt the evidence of my own ears.\" Mrs. Ashton, with clasped hands up, sat opposite to Jabez ; Mr. Ashton, lacking the consolation and inspiration of his snuff-box, walked about the room with one hand to his head in a state of distressing perturbation. He stopped in his walk to ask, \" What's to be done?\" as Jabez made this declaration, unconscious of its force. The light of the chamber candle fell upon the haggard face and drenched garments of the young man. The elder one looked full at him, paused, then drawing near and lay ing his right hand heavily on the other's wet shoulder, asked in a troubled voice, with an inquisitorial but not unkind manner \u2014 \" My lad, did no other motive than duty to your employers bring you eighteen miles through the rain this dark night, to save Miss Ashton from an imprudent marriage ?\""], [94, "86 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Jabez had not stopped to analyse his own motives. Thus questioned, it was not with out embarrassment that he answered \u2014 \" Mrs. Ashton desired me, sir, to watch over Miss Ashton, and acquaint you with any matter affecting her welfare. But apart from that, sir, I could not see Miss Ashton in the toils of a libertine without an attempt to rescue her. I should have been a dastard to sit passive ; and even now I feel we are losing time.\" \" Just so, just so,\" assented Mr. Ashton. \" That reminds me, Peveril is in the street, and you are soaked to the skin. My dear \" \u2014 turning to his wife \u2014 \" will you arouse the servants, and see that neither horse nor rider suffers in our service more than we can help.\" Having thus got rid of his wife, of whom he stood somewhat in awe, he resumed his searching catechism of Jabez. \" And so, Clegg, you have no motive be yond a chivalrous desire to save your mas-"], [95, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 87 ter's daughter, no interest to serve beyond your duty to us ?\" The ordeal was terrible. Jabez rose, his features working convulsively. \"Mr. Ashton, you are torturing me. Humble as I am, I love Miss Ashton with my whole life and soul. But knowing the distance between us, I have striven to keep the secret in my own breast. And I protest I had no double motive in my journey hither.\" The genial small-ware manufacturer, to whom that night had brought two revela tions, looked Jabez steadfastly in the face as he made his avowal ; then, taking him kind ly by the hand, said \u2014 his eyes swimming \u2014 \" Just so, just so. my lad ! I believe you. And, Jabez Clegg, let me tell you that I would rather give my daughter to an up right persevering man like you, without a penny, than to a spendthrift like Laurence Aspinall, though he rolled in riches. But it's no use saying that now!'"], [96, "88 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Indeed there was no use, and time wTas flying. A glance of grateful attachment, and a mute pressure of his liberal master's hand, were the sole acknowledgment of Jabez. But a new bond was established between the twain. Mrs. Ashton had come back to discuss with her husband and Jabez the best mode of procedure. She was not less shrewd than her lord, and had not failed to per ceive that the young man's heart was in the service he now rendered them. The blow dealt by Augusta to her pride dashed down the impalpable barrier between them, and she took counsel with him as a tried and true friend. Mr. Clegg pointed out the necessity for his return to the mill before it should open, and he be missed ; and taking a proffered glass of brandy and water to avert cold, he hurried, whilst hot coffee was preparing, to change his soaked garments preparatory to the ride back; his elders also taking the"], [97, "89 THE MANCHESTER MAN. opportunity to dress and prepare for depart ure with the morning coach. Not a moment was wasted, but though Peveril had been well groomed and fed, he was not as fresh to the road as he had been ; still the journey was homeward, the rain had abated ; day began to dawn as he left Stock port behind, and without much use of the whip, Jabez had his horse back in the stable before the factory bell began to ring. And then the beast was allowed to rest. The jaded man had to rouse himself to another day's work, another day's trial and excite ment, without a moment for repose. To everybody's astonishment, Mr. and Mrs. Ashton stepped out of the \" Lord Nelson \" coach, that morning, at the bottom of the avenue, with a carpet-bag for luggage. The difference of their reception by daughter and niece was palpable, and they could not fail to observe how much the former was disconcerted by their arrival. \" Oh, aunt and uncle, this is a pleasant"], [98, "90 THE MANCHESTER MAN. surprise !\" exclaimed Ellen, running down the avenue to meet them. \" You do not appear very well pleased to see us, Augusta,\" remarked Mrs. Ashton, as they met her lazily sauntering through the garden towards them, as captivating in her printed morning dress as a sleepless night, an anxious headache, and her unmistakable confusion would permit the recognised beauty to be. \" Oh, yes, I am pleased enough, but I should have been better pleased if you had written instead of coming upon one so sud denly. It is quite startling !\" and the petu lance of her tone gave effect to the pettish frown on her brow. \" My dear, ' ill thoughts make ill looks,' \" said Mrs. Ashton gravely, with a searching glance. \" What is the matter with you this morning? Nothing serious, I hope.\" The very inquiry apparently annoyed her. \" Oh, I've got a headache, that's all. I"], [99, "91 THE MANCHESTER MAN. heard a man's foot on the gravel-walk long after everyone was in bed, and I got a fright.\" \" I think it was only Crazy Joe \u2014 he hangs about at all hours,\" put in Ellen, who had not heard the crunch of Mr. Clegg's heel on the gravel, as he stood for a moment under their window, to \u25a0 breathe a prayer for the safety and well-being of the supposed sleeper, before he turned away swiftly on his errand. Almost Mr. Ashton's first inquiry was f<?r Mr. Clegg. \" He's at the mill, sir. He was off afore any on us was up ; an' he said happen he mightna git whome fur breakfast, he wur so busy,\" was the reply of Bess. But Mr. Ashton, setting off towards the factory, encountered Jabez on the way, and they returned together to breakfast, as if they had met for the first time that morning. On Mrs. Ashton's suggestion, Augusta was neither questioned nor accused."], [100, "92 THE MANCHESTER MAN. \" We should only tempt her to deny, and perhaps provoke ill-will towards our inform ant, with no good end,\" she said. \" Better wait and ascertain beyond question what her intentions are.\" Jabez would fain have spared her the pain and shame of exposure, but the matter was out of his hands. The day passed unmarked save by Au gusta's restless look-out for Crazy Joe, and the way she hung about her mother, as if half afraid of the rash step she contem plated. Mr. Ashton meanwhile, to cover his distress and agitation, busied himself about the transfer of the White Hart (which he pronounced \" admirable \") to its place over the inn-door, and managed to elicit from Chapman, the gossiping landlord, without direct inquiry, that a fine young spark in hunting gear had put up his horse there several times within the past week, and was like to make the fortune of Crazy Joe, he"], [101, "93 THE MANCHESTER MAN. gave the poor softy so many half-crowns ; but Joe was \" deep, and never let on what he got them for.\""], [102, "94 CHAPTER VI.

Thus, as he was compelled to pass through the Hulmes' sleeping-apartment, so Ellen and Augusta were constrained\" to go backwards and forwards through that of Mr. and Mrs. Ashton \u2014 an arrangement to which long use had probably reconciled them. It was this fact which had so much disconcerted Augusta, since she foresaw a difficulty in escaping unheard ; and not"], [103, "95 THE MANCHESTER MAN. meeting with Joe (that most unpromising of Cupids), she was as equally unable to convey a message to her expectant lover. She repented her rash promise, and would fain have availed herself of a pretext for delay; but the night came, and, haunted by imaginery pictures of Laurence with a pistol to his head, she dared not disappoint him. She had promised to meet him at that entrance of the Lovers' Walk which opened below Yeardsley-Hall Farm into Moor Lane, whilst, the lane being a steep declivity, he was to keep the post-chaise in waiting at the foot. Her headache served as an excuse for retiring; to bed earlier than her cousin, and scarcely could her father and mother restrain themselves as she kissed them lingeringly before she went. Indeed, Mr. Ashton would much have preferred to \" have it out with the girl at once, and have done with it,\" there not being much \" waiting \" blood in his veins."], [104, "96 THE MANCHESTER MAN. He had kept out of her sight most of the day, fidgeting over one thing and another, whilst his waistcoat and shirt-frill bore testimony to the constant raid on his snuff box. \" I don't like to see my poor lass trapped like a bird in a cage,\" he said, in confidence, to Jabez, whose opinion he already knew agreed with his own, as did the desire to \" thrash the infernal scoundrel within an inch of his life.\" The last straw had broken the camel's back, and Jabez was no longer inclined to be passive. Laurence had bid Augusta take no care for her wardrobe ; his purse was ample, and he would dress her like a queen if she would only consent to fly with him. So, after collecting a few immediate necessaries and trinkets, and placing the reticule which contained them out of sight, she crept into bed, to lie and listen for the household to follow her example. How lazily the hours"], [105, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 97 lagged! She heard old Simon shufflino about, and the creaking of his camp-bedstead, as he settled his old rheumatic bones for the night, but the firm foot of Jabez she did not hear, though the house clock struck nine, and Ellen came up with the last stroke. In answer to a question, Ellen said that Mr. Clegg was asleep on the squab, and that she understood he had slept there the previous night, to be able to go to the mill very early, without disturbing anyone else. \" I saw him as he lay there, where he had fallen asleep shortly after tea, and I have been speaking to my uncle about him ; he looks so dreadfully worn and jaded, I am sure he is either killing himself with over work, or has some great trouble on his mind,\" and a deep sigh followed this ex pression of opinion. Augusta was silent. Something within her secret heart whispered that the trouble of Jabez Clegg would be intensified sevenfold by her act of that night; and, A'OL. III. H"], [106, "98 THE MANCHESTER MAN. haughty as she was betimes, she pitied him. And whatever were her compunctions, fears, or emotions, Jabez certainly shared with her parents in her thoughts. Ellen slept. The clock struck ten. Father and mother entered their room, and through the door which Augusta had artfully requested Ellen to \" leave open on account of the heat \" came the souud of their voices in low but earnest converse \u2014 \"You leave her to me, William,\" spoken with decision, being the only words she could distinguish, though she heard her father walk about for some time. Indeed, she thought he would never go to bed. Eleven ! She slipped stealthily from the side of her sleeping cousin, and by the light of the moon, clear enough to-night, dressed as noiselessly and rapidly as her trepidation would permit. From habit she knelt to pray, but as she came to the passage, \" Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,\" a new meaning seemed to flash"], [107, "99 THE MANCHESTER MAN. through the words, and she half wavered in her purpose. \" Poor Jabez !\" she murmured to herself, as she caught up her shoes and reticule, and listened in the open doorway for the deep breathing which came from behind the dimity curtains of the four-post bed. Re-assured, she stepped lightly across the room in her stocking-feet, turned the drop handle of that chamber door as silently as the squeaking latch would permit, and fled swiftly down the stairs, sitting down at the bottom to put on her shoes. She had raised the sash, and was in the very act of stepping over the low window sill, when a foot was heard on the stair, and turning her head, she saw her mother fully dressed close by her side, and felt her slight wrist grasped as in a vice. \" Is this your filial love and obedience, misguided girl?

Could you not think that chastity is the brightest jewel in a woman's crown, and the soonest dimmed, that you were ready to leave your character at the mercy of every gossip who had a tongue to wag ?\" She had drawn Augusta, too much stun ned to speak, into the parlour close at hand, and had shut the doors \u2014 a needless pre caution, seeing how remote were all sleepers. A few words of gentle motherly inquiry might have softened impulsive, tender hearted Augusta to tears, and turned the whole current of her life ; but Mrs. Ashton's stateliness had become sternness, and, fresh from the evil teaching of Laurence Aspinall, her daughter's proud spirit rose in rebellion, and answered her. \" We are going to be married. And I was not going with Laurence alone. Cicily"], [109, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 101 was to travel with us. Laurence himself proposed it.\" \" Infatuated girl !\" exclaimed Mrs. Ash ton, \" Cicily wras in Mosley Street last night.\" \"And so were you, mother,\" was the smart retort, \" but the coach which dropped you here carried her to Buxton.

Not even your cousin has a notion of this last folly. Our daughter's honour is dearer to us than to herself,\" and the mother's tone softened as she spoke. \" Your daughter's honour has never been"], [111, "103 THE MANCHESTER MAN. in any danger,\" said Augusta haughtily, as she swept from the room, to encounter at the foot of the stairs, flooded by moonlight through the open window, her father \u2014 and Jabez. Up to that moment she had stood on the defensive, her wayward spirit upholding and arming her for retort. The sight of the father who had indulged her every whim, and of Jabez whose esteem she valued more than she herself knew, gave a sudden shock to her overwrought nerves, and she fell forward into the arms of Jabez in a deep swoon. Tenderly, respectfully, sadly, he bore her into the parlour, and, placing her on the sofa, relinquished her to her mother, divest ing himself of his shoes in order to procure water to restore her without creating alarm. When she recovered he was gone ; she was alone with the parents whose counsels she had despised, whose love she had wounded ; herself detected and humiliated."], [112, "104 THE MANCHESTER MAN. A greater humiliation had fallen to the lot of elate, enamoured, and self-satisfied Laurence Aspinall, when, leaving his friend Barret with the post-chaise, their saddle horses, and Cicily at the bottom of Moor Lane, he mounted the hill and whistled softly at the entrance of the Lovers' Walk, to call forth \u2014 not a blushing maiden, half afraid of her own temerity, but \u2014 two justly incensed and indignant men. His low voiced \" Augusta \" died upon his lips ; he recoiled, stammered \u2014 \" You ! I \u2014 I did not expect D \u2014 nation ! What brought you here ? I thought \" \" Just so, you atrocious scoundrel, you thought God had left our pet lamb to the fangs of the wolf, and that neither father nor friend was near to protect the innocent !\" exclaimed Mr. Ashton, raising the stout bamboo with which he was provided. \" If that infernal Cicily has betrayed us, I'll \""], [113, "105 THE MANCHESTER MAN, The threat was not completed, for Jabez interrupted him with \u2014 \"No, sir, it was not Cicily.

Am I to meet you at every turn ?

Jabez dexterously caught the hght whip, and wrenched it from him, a simultane ous sharp blow of Mr. Ashton's bamboo on Aspinall's shoulders tending to loosen his grasp. And then the two young men, with all the fever of jealousy added to old animosity, closed and grappled with each"], [114, "106 THE MANCHESTER MAN. other as might a lion and a tiger in the arena. And Mr. Ashton, his love of fair play yielding to his exasperation, made good use of his bamboo whenever he could deal a blow without harming Jabez. The two combatants were not unequally matched ; there was little difference in size and weight, but the scientific skill of Lau rence had more than a counterpoise in the nerve and muscle of Jabez, strengthened by exercise and a temperate life, whilst vicious courses had somewhat impaired his own athletic frame. The struggle on the steep hill-side was too deadly for noise. At length Laurence \u2014 himself booted and spurred \u2014 in striving to take an unfair advantage and rip the un protected calves of Jabez with the rowels of his spurs, lost his foothold, and was borne to the earth, falling heavily. He lay on the ground stunned and motionless. At once Jabez, with a swift revulsion of feeling, knelt down by the side of his prostrate foe,"], [115, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 107 and raised his head; Mr. Ashton bending over them inquiringly, just as Barret, whom curiosity and impatience had drawn from his post below, came on the scene. A stifled groan, and a muttered curse, having assured Clegg that his rival was not mortally in jured, he called to Barret \u2014 \" Here, sir, take charge of your worthy principal; and be careful, when next you plan an elopement, that you have not a man to deal with instead of a credulous girl.\" Mr. Ashton's \" Just so !\" coming sharply in as chorus, the young man put his arm in that of the elder and drew him away, leaving Barret and the postilion to restore Laurence Aspinall, and assist him into the post-chaise by the side of Cicily \u2014 whose trepidation would have been very much increased could she have seen how the blood was trickling down from a wound in his head, staining still more the torn, miry"], [116, "108 THE MANCHESTER MAN. coat, and the disordered shirt-frill over which he was usually so fastidious. Barret, leading his companion's horse, rode on in advance of the vehicle, to pre pare the pompous gentleman, laid up with the gout in Buxton Crescent, for the reception of his gentlemanly son in a highly gentle manlike condition \u2014 hatless, wigless, dirty, dilapidated, bruised, bloody \u2014 and unsuccess ful. The hat had rolled down-hill, to be crushed under the wheels of the chaise ; the wig and broken whip were found the next morning by Crazy Joe, who exercised his witless head respecting them and the tram pled ground to small purpose ; then brought them to his friend Sim as playthings. Had they fallen into the hands of a reasoning mortal, much more perplexity, and a very serious mystery, might have been the result. Buxton being only five miles from Whaley-Bridge, Barret again made his appearance in the neighbourhood of the \"White Hart,\" whilst the new sign still"], [117, "109 THE MANCHESTER MAN. attracted rustic admirers ; and, finding no rumours current respecting the occurrence of the preceding night, he rode off again, having first committed to Crazy Joe a scarcely decipherable missive from the dis comfited lover to the not less disconsolate damsel. The evening coach bore the Ashtons and Ellen back to Manchester ; Augusta still in a rebellious mood, the cause of which, being hidden from her cousin, occasioned the latter no little perplexity. There was something, too, in the manner of her uncle and aunt to Jabez, and of Jabez to all, which, being undefinable and impalpable, struck her as peculiar. He seemed suddenly to have risen to another footing. How was it they had taken him into their confidence ?

LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON. IT is no uncommon thing for a woman to gild a block, wreathe it with flowers, and then fall down and worship the idol she has adorned. Augusta's hero needed no outward embellishment, so she fitted the fair exterior with the perfections and vir tues of the high-spirited, noble, generous Mortimers and Mowbrays whose acquaint ance she had made in print, and had set him on a very elevated pedestal, in spite of all warnings. With that misleading letter of his before her, no wonder if the \"blood shed for her sweet sake \" converted the hero into the martyr, and placed Jabez and"], [121, "113 THE MANCHESTER MAN. her father in the category of cruel perse cutors. It did more. It erected a barrier against reconciliation. In vain her placable father held out a flag of truce ; she kept aloof resentfully, though in the solitude of her own chamber she gave way, and wept at her isolation from all who loved her. Mrs. Ashton, whose sense of propriety had been outraged, whose maternal pride had received a terrible shock, was less readily disposed to condone her daughter's offence ; and, being a better business woman than a psychologist, her tactics showed none of her ordinary shrewdness. The failure of Augusta's banishment to Carr should have taught her that romance is nursed in solitude, and that conciliation is better than coercion. Had she spared a few hours from the warehouse to arrange a dance, or a gipsy-party to Dunham Park ; chaperoned her lovely daughter to assembly, theatre, or concert-room ; invited her com panionship in a stroll through St. Ann's VOL.

Instead, never was the golden fruit of the Hesperides more vigilantly guarded. She was kept much within doors. The modern notion that a daily airing is indis pensable had not been promulgated, or had not become the creed of the manufacturing community. Mrs. Ashton had \" no leisure for gadding,\" and Augusta cared little to drive in the gig with only James for her charioteer, or even to walk with Ellen, so long as the mulberry-coloured livery was in attendance. (It might have been otherwise,"], [123, "115 THE MANCHESTER MAN. had not the said James held it as much \"beneath his dignity\" to accept a bribe as he had formerly done to wait upon Mr. Clegg.) From her old bed-room, which overlooked Mosley Street, she was relegated to one in the rear which commanded no wider prospect than their own courtyard, nor anything more interesting than Nelson and his kennel \u2014 by-the-by, Nelson had been in favour since the sad accident on the ice. Then, visits to Marsden Square were pro hibited lest she should there meet John Walmsley's undesirable friend ; and alto gether her escapade had converted home into a cage, in spite of its gilding. As might have been expected, the high spirited, wayward girl, so long her father's pet, so long indulged in her caprices, chafed and rebelled against every fresh token of restraint, and contrasted the dull monotony of her life with the freedom and gaiety promised so frequently by Laurence as the certain concomitants of wifehood with him. 12"], [124, "116 THE MANCHESTER MAN. With all her haughty spirit, she had a clinging, affectionate nature, tinged though it was with poetry and romance ; and now that her father looked so unusually grave, and her mother so frigid, and she felt her self an alien from both their hearts, instead of bewailing her premeditated flight as a crime, the tendrils of her love only clung closer to him who professed so much, and the more she was isolated from them, the more she brooded on the ill-used and maligned Laurence, his manly beauty and accomplishments, his lavish generosity, his fascinations of voice and manner, and the fervour of his passion for her. Meanwhile, Tom Hulme had resumed his duties at Whaley-Bridge Mill, and Jabez returned home to his. Much to Augusta's surprise, he was not only invited to dine with them on the day of his return, but to take his place henceforth at their board as one of the family. With Laurence's misrepresentations fixed"], [125, "117 THE MANCHESTER MAN. in her mind as truths, she construed the daily association thus thrust upon her as a deliberate affront, and resented it with a silent scorn which cut Jabez to the soul. He knew nothing of Aspinall's letter, or that he was accused of a \"ruffianly attack;\" he only felt that he would have died to serve her, and had done what he had to save her from life-long misery without a single thought of keeping her for himself. A few more days, and back to Manchester came Mr. Aspinall senior, having left a little of his portliness with his gout in the Buxton Baths. Back with him came his son, and his son's congenial companion, Mr. Edmund Barret ; the former still smarting under his defeat at Carr, and all the more resolutely determined to carry off Augusta, jealousy adding a new element to his love, a new aliment to his hate. Sitting idly by the parlour window on the third of October, with her head leaning against the frame, meditating on her own"], [126, "118 THE MANCHESTER MAN. unhappiness and her parents' harshness, Au gusta suddenly started to her feetjwith a sup pressed cry of delight, a vivid glow upon her cheeks, a brilliant sparkle in her eye. Laurence Aspinall, mounted on Black Ralph, his favourite hunter, was riding up the street, the dislocated ankle apparently not affecting his enjoyment of equestrian exer cise. As he raised his new beaver in grace ful salutation, even the flutter into which she was thrown could not prevent her missing his glorious curls. He had not deemed it necessary to replace his wig, and the poll shorn during fever had not yet grown a fresh crop ripe for harvest. The unfavourable impression passed with the moment, as he brought his obedient steed on the flagged pavement close under the win dow, and without a moment's hesitation she raised the sash, and leaned forward to speak with him, glad of the opportunity. \" Oh, Laurence !\""], [127, "119 THE MANCHESTER MAN. \"My own Augusta, this is indeed fortun ate !\" Their hands clasped upon the window-sill, \u2014 the elevation of the house raising her to his level \u2014 her tearful eyes looked up in his for traces of suffering after the \" ruffianly attack,\" and found there, mingled with the fierce light of violent love, a bitter sense of defeat, a resolve to obtain her by fair means or foul. Each had the separate experience of that memorable September night to relate, coloured as passion or prejudice prevailed ; but neither could fully enlighten the other as to the share Mr. Clegg had had in pre venting the elopement. He could tell her that Jabez had avowed overhearing their conversation in the Lovers' Walk, though where he could have been to overhear, or what strange fatality could bring Mr. and Mrs. Ashton to Carr in time to become the recipients of his eavesdropping and defeat their plans, was a puzzle to both."], [128, "120 ME MANCHESTER MAN. Be sure Laurence put the worst colour on the encounter in the lane, and urged all he had himself endured to strengthen his claims upon her \u2014 claims she was quite willing to admit, had she the power to concede to them. Having shown with very evident annoy ance how impossible it was for her to meet or give him a private interview, he exclaimed with indignation \u2014 \" What ! not allowed to visit a relative, or to go abroad without a gaoler ! My dearest Augusta, this is a cruel state of captivity. But my bird must not be allowed to fray her beautiful plumage in beating against the bars of her cage. I must devise a better plan for her escape. Any means are justifi able to obtain release from tyranny like this. What says my love? Is she still willing to trust her Laurence ?\" \"To the death !\"she whispered emphatic- ally. \" You are alone here every morning !\""], [129, "121 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Her lips could barely frame a \" Yes,\" when a voice and step in the hall warned her to close the window with a hurried gesture to him ; and before Mrs. Ashton, who had lingered to give an order to James, could enter the room, Black Ralph was cantering towards the Portico, and Augusta occupied with the third volume of \" Alinda, or the Child of Mystery.\" Very little escaped Mrs. Ashton's eye. The clatter of hoofs on the flags, audible through the thick front door, had left no sensible impression on her brain, but the heightened colour of Augusta attracted her attention at once. She brought her work basket from the panel-cupboard, took thence a strip of cambric muslin, and handed it to her daughter. \"My dear,\" said she quietly, \"'all play makes no hay.' Your eyes are younger than mine, and I think it will do you more good to hem your father's shirt-frills than to pore over sentimental books from morning until"], [130, "122 THE MANCHESTER MAN. night. So much romance-reading is not good for you. I see that you are quite flushed and excited over the one you are perusing now. There was a sharp rat-tat on the lion's head, and in burst Mr. Ashton, much more flushed and excited than his daughter. He had met Mr. Laurence on Black Ralph just as he was quitting the Portico, after an angry discussion with Mr. Aspinall the elder. \" You are quite right, my dear, in saying. 'Like father, like son,'\" cried he, \"for I'll swallow my snuff-box if that pompous old cotton-merchant did not justify his scape grace son in his attempt to carry off our Augusta! He said that 'the end justified the means,' that we ' ought to be proud of such an alliance'\" \u2014 Mrs. Ashton's lip curled \u2014 \" that ' he was glad Miss Ashton had more discernment than her parent,' that ' his boy had set his heart upon her, and should not be thwarted in his choice by any beggar's-"], [131, "123 THE MANCHESTER MAN. inkle-weaver in England.' And no sooner had I left him in the reading-room, to digest my opinion on the subject, and put my foot on the steps of the Portico, than up rode young Hopeful, and took off his hat to me, bowing down to his black horse's mane.\" Having delivered himself of this explosive intelligence, Mr. Ashton walked about, and sought a sedative in his snuff-box ; and Au gusta, who, folding the hem of the frill, had not lost one word, said, drily, \" I think Mr. Aspinall's justification of his son's design may at least be taken as a vindi cation of Mr. Laurence's honourable inten tions, of which so many doubts have been expressed. And the bow equally absolves Laurence from a charge of malice.\" With a proud toss of her shapely head, she walked towards the dining-room, reject ing the proffered arm of Jabez, who had entered the parlour whilst Mr. Ashton was speaking, and thus closed a discussion which"], [132, "124 THE MANCHESTER MAN. could not be continued in the presence of servants. Jabez, on his return from Carr, had found his rough old clerical friend confined to his room seriously ill. Tabitha was worn out with his humours and eccentricities, and was glad when the young man offered to relieve her twice or thrice a week ; and old Joshua welcomed him as a relief from the monoto nous garrulity of an unlettered old woman. Jabez could bring him news of another stamp. Through Ben Travis (who had dis covered that activity was the best antidote to melancholy), he kept him informed of the progress of the incipient temperance move ment, in which the Parson took uncommon interest ; through Mr. Ashton, he kept him au courant of town politics, and for general intelligence he brought newspapers with him to read interrupted by many and unique commentaries.

One night, towards the middle of October, when Joshua had been more than ordinarily crusty, and Jabez did not quit the classic corner until the \" wee short hour ayont the twal,\" he was struck as he turned the corner from Market Street into Mosley Street to find Mr. Aspinall's carriage in waiting with four horses and postilions. He stood still for a moment to reassure himself, but carriages were not so common that he should mistake that one ; and his heart drummed an alarm within his breast. Hurrying on with sad misgivings, he passed two tall figures muffled in cloaks, whom he had no difficulty in recognizing, from build and walk, to be the Aspinalls, father and son ; and increasing his speed he gained the door, inserted his key in the latch, and was on the stairs before the cloaked individuals had finished their speculations respecting his"], [134, "126 THE MANCHESTER MAN. being a robber escaped from a constable. Formerly, Augusta had to pass his room door to reach her own, on the opposite side of the long corridor. Her new chamber was next to his own, and nearer to the stair case. A thin stream of light shot through the key-hole, and a bright narrow line cast upon the opposite wall showed the door ajar. He stood still in his surprise. As if a tipsy, musically-disposed man were going past, the refrain of a rollicking song was trolled out in the street ; and then Augusta, equipped as for a journey, came forth from her chamber to descend the stairs. She had calculated on the signal an hour earlier, and expected Jabez an hour later. As she stole on tiptoe down the stairs Jabez confronted her and barred her progress. Her silver candlestick dropped from her hand, with the one word \" Again !\" and rolling down with a clang, awakened Mr. and Mrs. Ashton, the only"], [135, "127 THE MANCHESTER MAN. sleepers on that floor, and set Nelson bark ing furiously.

Oh, my child, my child, you are breaking your poor old father's heart !\" \" And mine !\" floated like the echo of despair's last sigh from the lips of Jabez. But the utter hopelessness of the old man's tone touched a sensitive chord of Augusta's soul, and turning, she fell upon his neck crying tearfully, \" Oh ! forgive me, father, forgive me. I did not think you would take it so much to heart.\""], [136, "128 THE MANCHESTER MAN.

The tender-hearted father was in a pitiable state of perturbation. In and out the warehouse he was twenty times in the day \u2014 as Kezia observed, \" For a' th' world like a hen on a hot griddle ;\" and his snuff-box was hardly ever out of his hand. Business seemed altogether beyond his grasp ; he answered questions at random, or was unconscious when ad dressed. To this state of trouble Jabez uninten tionally contributed his quota.

At the close of the second day, as Augusta pertinaciously refused to open her door, at the instance of Jabez the lock was forced; and even then a barrier of chairs and boxes had to be thrust back by sheer strength. She was exhausted from want of food, but her will was indomitable, and neither her father's entreaties nor her mother's commands could induce her to partake of the viands spread before her.

From Tim, the Ashton stable-boy, Aspin all's emissary (Bob the groom, once more in his old service) had no difficulty in obtaining all the information his young master needed. Laurence waylaid Mr. Ashton, inquired anxiously after the obstinate girl's health, and, having paved the way by as much contrition as he thought necessary, called at the house the following morning, in company with his father, to renew propos als for Miss Ashton's hand.

The joyous excitement attending Au gusta's own preparations for her approach ing nuptials was somewhat damped by the unaccountable condition of Ellen Chadwick, whose health, instead of improving during her visit to Carr Cottage, had appeared to decline still more perceptibly. A constant pain at her chest, frequent headaches, un certain spirits, and increasing languor gave Mr. and Mrs. Chadwick real cause for un-"], [157, "149 THE MANCHESTER MAN. easiness ; but Ellen would not hear of a doctor, and maintained that it was \" nothing to trouble about,\" she should \"be better soon.\" But she did not get \"better soon,\" and when the first August sun shone on Au gusta's birthday and bridal, it taxed her powers to the utmost to sustain efficiently her part as bridesmaid. Had Captain Travis accepted his lieu tenant's invitation to be groomsman, she would have found it still more difficult ; but a comparative stranger, a Mr. Joseph Bennett, of Gorton, filled the post, the bride's father having objected very decided ly to bold Ned Barret. Yet Ben Travis and Jabez Clegg were both among the guests, albeit it cost each a struggle. The two had mutually strengthened each other as such friends should, arriving at the Spartan decision to \" suffer and be silent, facing their fate like men.\" And indeed, old Mr. Ashton had"], [158, "150 THE MANCHESTER MAN. wrung the hand of Jabez at least a week before, and said \u2014 \" I'm sorry for you, Clegg ; I am, upon my soul ; and I'm sorry for our poor lass too, for she's made a mistake. But keep a brave heart, and don't let that slashing yeomanry fellow crow over you. As Mrs. Ashton would say, ' What can't be cured must be endured,' and we must all of us show the best face at the wedding that we can.\" If that meant elaborate display in dress and decorations, and provision for the bridal breakfast and dinner, then the face exhibited was a shining one. Mrs. Hodg son, the fashionable mantua-maker and milliner of Oldham Street (where two or three of the private houses had already been converted into shops), had kept her apprentices at work almost night and day for weeks, executing bridal orders from the Ashtons and their friends. A very snowstorm might have passed through the"], [159, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 151 work-room, such heaps of white French crape and satin, lace and organdi, lute string and gauze, littered and covered avafl able space, putting matronly brocade, vel vet, and llama quite into the shade. The warehouse saw little of Mrs. Ashton for a week or ten days previously. Cicily, who had gone over to the Aspinalls, had begged to be allowed to help Kezia for that occasion ; and she roasted her own face in spinning gold and silver webs and baskets from sugar for the table, making \" floating islands,\" syllabubs, trifles, jellies, and blanc mange to supplement the solid dishes Kezia dressed with so much skill. And Mr. Mabbott sent in a \"Temple of Hymen\" and a bride's cake prepared six weeks in advance. The bride, alternately radiant and tear ful like an April day, veiled with lace, and crowned with white rose-buds and orange blossoms, wore a low-bodiced dress of white satin, festooned round the narrow"], [160, "152 THE MANCHESTER MAN. skirt with costly lace, whilst on neck and arms, and in her tiny ears, were neglige, bracelets, and earrings of pearl, the gift of the gallant bridegroom's gallant father. The bridegroom was scarcely less re splendent in his high-collared blue coat and gold buttons, his white waistcoat buttoned to match, his glossy white trousers, and low shoes tied with a bunch of silk ferret. An oblong brooch set with a rim of pearls held down his broad fine shirt-frills; from his fob hung a huge bunch of gold seals pendent from a flat gold watch-chain ; and in his hand (not crushing his elaborate curls, now clustering richly as ever) he carried a hat of white beaver of the newest shape. To Mr. and Mrs. Ashton it was a matter of open regret that Joshua Brookes, who had christened Augusta, should not have lived to marry her also ; but Mr. Aspinall, whose reminiscences of the old chaplain were of another order, was much better satisfied"], [161, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 153 to see his own personal friend Parson Gatliffe, the bon vivant, behind the altar rails. If the bride was tall and graceful, with sunshine in her eyes and in her classic curls, tall and stately was the bride's mother, whose long train of purple silk velvet swept the aisles, though trains had ceased to be general. There was no falter ing over the responses. There was a glow of modest pride on the cheek of Augusta ; a look of mingled ardour and exultation on the face of Laurence ; his \" 1 wiU \" was pronounced with a force which was almost fierce, yet, as she faintly promised to \" obey,\" he pressed her hand with smiling significance. The ceremony over, the bride did not faint, but turning to her tearful-eyed father, threw her arms around his neck and clung to him, whispering how grateful she was that he had given her the man of her choice, and that he should see what a"], [162, "154 THE MANCHESTER MAN. good wife she would make; and the im promptu embrace sent a shower of snuff over white satin and lace. Yet some one fainted, whom Ben Travis caught in his strong arms and carried to the church door for air : a dark-haired, black-eyed bridesmaid, whose face was white and skin transparent as her own robe. Custom had not set its imperative seal on the wedding tour as a necessity, but after a magnificent solid dinner, to which the party did full justice, and an elaborate dessert, during which the cake was cut, and Mr. Aspinall proposed the health of the bride in an inflated toast, demanding that it should be drunk in bumpers, \" and no heel-taps,\" the wedded pair drove off in Mr. Aspinall's carriage to the family man sion at Fallowfield, there to spend the honeymoon. \" Good-bye, Jabez,\" said Augusta, put ting her small soft hand into his as they"], [163, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 155 left the house ; \" you will comfort my father and mother, will you not ? I trust them to you.\" And he replied with the fervency of truth, \" I accept the trust willingly. Good-bye, Mrs. Aspinall \" (how the word choked him!). \"May God bless you, and the marriage you have contracted. Good bye !\" He did not kiss her hand, had not taken the common liberty of guests to kiss the bride's lips in church ; he did but press her hand as any old friend who had grown up with her under the same roof jmight have done ; but before the carriage had well dashed from the door, or the bridegroom had fairly settled himself on his seat, Lau rence turned to the fair young wife, whose prophetic tears were now falling fast, with the sharp rebuke \u2014 \" What was that foundling fellow mumb ling over your hand ? You will please to remember that that hand is mine now, Mrs."], [164, "156 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Aspinall. You have promised to love and obey me \u2014 me your lord and master. And master I mean to be. I have borne the fooling of your friends and your own pretty caprices long enough. It is my turn now ; and if any man so much as dares to look at you I'll pound him to a jelly ! And now dry your eyes and give me a kiss !\" And that was the inauguration of Au gusta Aspinall's married life. It has been said that the bridesmaid fainted. Every lady carried a smelling bottle, and means to revive her were not far to seek. She soon recovered, and with a sensitive blush withdrew from the arms which had been so proud to sustain her, -casting her eyes round as if in search of some other whose service might have been more acceptable. But she suffered no re lapse. She was ready to wait upon the bride, to sign \"Ellen Chadwick\" in the church register, and to assist Mr. Joseph Bennett in cutting up the cake for distribu-"], [165, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 157 tion, with cards and gloves, to friends not present. It was an arduous task, and she succumbed before it was half completed. \"Miss Chadwick, you are not well; let me relieve you,\" said Jabez, coming to her assistance after the \"happy pair\" had driven off, and whilst peals of laughter, shouts, and hurrahs came from the dining room where gentlemen were honouring the bridal by drinking themselves sense less and speechless. Ellen remained with her aunt a few days longer, during which Jabez, exceedingly pained to see the ravages hidden disease had made in so estimable a young lady, was pitifully attentive. He could not, however, fail to see that his attentions distressed her ; and, on the whole, he was not sorry when Augusta's parents and he were left to themselves, to talk of their own dear one and speculate on her future. Weeks went by. Mrs. Aspinall visited"], [166, "158 THE MANCHESTER MAN. her old home, but never without her husband ; and seldom was she allowed to remain more than an hour. Her spirits seemed exuberant, but somehow her un usual vivacity jarred on her mother's nerves, and she suspected that her spirits were forced. Meanwhile Ellen Chadwick faded. Dr. Hardie, called in at last, watched his patient with curious and attentive eye, perplexed and dubious. He had been friend as well as physician since Mr. Chad wick's attack of paralysis, and was a close observer. Now he came and went in a gossiping sort of way, to put his patient at ease, and off her guard. He was there one day when Jabez was announced, and saw a sudden spasmodic action of the face, a dilation of the pupils, a scarcely percept ible pant and parting of the lips, and then he watched her closer. He introduced Mr. Clegg's name, as if casually, whilst his fingers were on her pulse. The result of"], [167, "159 THE MANCHESTER MAN. his observations were told to Mr. Chadwick the same day. \" Your daughter has no specific disease, Mr. Chadwick. She is simply love-sick.\" \" L-love-s-sick ?\" \"Yes; and her secret passion is con suming her. Medicine cannot save the patient's life if her affection be not return ed, and that right speedily.\" Mr. Chadwick was aghast. \" I feared as much,\" said Mrs. Chadwick, with a sigh. \" Then you will have an inkling who is the desired object ?\" said the doctor. \" I think so.\" \" Does your maternal instinct point to Mr. Clegg ?\" he asked, with a curious look. \" It does ; but he himself has no sus picion, and I am sure regards Ellen only as a friend \u2014 a friend elevated a little above him.\" \" Is the young man courting ?\" \" I believe not.\""], [168, "160 THE MANCHESTER MAN. \" Then,\" said the doctor sententiously, \" the sooner he is, the better for Miss Chadwick. Her life is not worth a month's purchase unless Mr. Clegg become the buyer. But let not Miss Ellen hear a whisper of my opinion. Good day.\" And snatching up his hat the doctor departed, leaving them to their reflections. Here was a delicate subject to be dealt with, and that without either loss of time or the sacrifice of their beloved child's sen sitiveness and reserve. Unknown to Ellen a family conclave assembled under the Mosley Street roof, to discuss the momentous question, and deli berate what was best to be done. Long and grave were their deliberations. At length, taking Mr. Chadwick's imperfect speech into consideration, Mr. Ashton con sented to lay the case before Jabez, and leave his brother-in-law to supplement it, if necessary ; though opinions were divided as to the result."], [169, "161 THE MANCHESTER MAN. It was after business hours, and Mr. Ash ton found Jabez in his own room, doing his best to dissipate thought by hard work, mind and hand being busy with a chintz pattern for calico-printing. There was a nervous plunge into the gold snuff-box, and a consequent flourish of a gay bandana, and some time spent in examining the incomplete design on the desk, before Mr. Ashton could fairly enter on his embassy. After a little prelude, in which, whilst enlarging on the serious nature of his niece's illness, he elicited from Jabez that he held the young lady in the very highest esteem, and was deeply grieved to hear of her perilous state, he put down his snuff-box on the table before him, and drawing up his chair so as to bring their heads closer together, looked steadfastly into the other's clear eyes as he put the question \u2014 \"And what should you think of love as the cause of her malady ?\" VOL. III. m"], [170, "162 THE MANCHESTER MAN. \" Love !\" echoed Jabez, his mind running off to the agonised confession made to him on the Taxal hdlside. \"Yes, love, and for the very man whose merits my foolish child faded to see.\" Jabez looked at him vaguely. \" Surely not Mr. Marsland !\" \"Pah ! no !\" exclaimed Mr. Ashton, as if disgusted at his obtuseness. \"Yourself, man \u2014 Jabez Clegg.\" Jabez fixed his eyes on his informant in blank amazement, a monosyllabic long drawn \" Me !\" being his sole response. \" Just so !\" assented Mr. Ashton, and he took a pinch of snuff on the strength of it. \" Oh, sir, there must be some mistake ! How has this been ascertained ? Has Miss Chadwick made \" \" No, Clegg, the poor lass has never said one word, except with her eyes and pulse. Dr. Hardie has made the discovery now, and it turns out Mrs. Chadwick suspected it long ago.\""], [171, "163 THE MANCHESTER MAN. \" Oh, dear ! dear ! this is very terrible !\" He was estimating the pain in Ellen's heart by that in his own. \" Very terrible indeed, Clegg, for Hardie says the lass's life is not worth so much as a yard of filleting if her love meets no return.\" The head of Jabez sank in his open hands upon the table. What would his friend Travis think of all this ? Presently he raised his face, over which a strange change had passed. \" Mr. Ashton, what would you have me do ?\" \" Whatever Jabez Clegg thinks he ought to do,\" he answered steadily, adding in another tone, \" I would have been glad to have given thee my own child : my brother in-law implores thee to take his child, to save her life.\" After a prolonged silence Jabez spoke. \"Mr. Ashton, I hold that love alone can sanctify marriage : my love has blos- m 2"], [172, "164 THE MANCHESTER MAN. somed and died fruitless. Yet so highly do I esteem Miss Chadwick, and so proud am I of the great honour she has done me in her preference, that I place myself in your hands. If I can spare so amiable a young lady the pain I suffer from rejected love, I should be a brute and a savage to refuse her the remnant of a valueless life. We may at least soften its asperities for each other.\" The Chadwicks went home with minds relieved, but Jabez had stipulated that nothing should be said to Eden of their overtures to him, no hint given which could alarm her shrinking modesty. The following day he called to inquire about her health, made his genuine anxiety apparent, and noted as he had never done before how her lip trembled and her eyelid drooped. Gradually, as his at tentions became more marked, her health and spirits rose, and when at last he proposed to her calmly, quietly, as though"], [173, "165 THE MANCHESTER MAN. he sought a haven when the frothy waves of a first passion had subsided, she accepted him as God's best gift, all unaware that his offer was not spon taneous, or that her cousin Augusta was yet deeply shrined in his secret heart. He had been at first greatly concerned about Ben Travis, but the generous fellow, to whom he felt in honour bound to explain his conduct, only wrung his hand and said \u2014 \" I could not resign her to a worthier.\""], [174, "166 CHAPTER X. BLOWS. OICHARD CHADWICK, who had \u2022*-*j served as a midshipman under Admiral Collingwood, and shared in the victory of Trafalgar, was a midshipman still, and hig vessel had long been away on a foreign station. Few, brief, and far between had been his opportunities to visit home aud friends.

Ellen's engagement and prospective marriage called forth a voluminous epistle, crossed and recrossed like a trellis, from Mrs. Chadwick to her son, whose presence she craved, if leave of absence could possibly be obtained. The letter was a singular compound of gratulation and apology, through which a thin under current of dissatisfaction meandered like a stream. His sister's strange malady and infatuation for a man of apparently low origin, whose name and parentage were alike unknown, were set forth to be deplored. Still, since the sole remedy for Ellen's ailment rested with this obscure Mr. Clegg, whose career upwards, from his floating cradle to his honourable position in the Ashton house and warehouse, was circumstantially detailed, his personal worth was a matter for congratulation ; and the deep obligation of the whole"], [176, "168 THE MANCHESTER MAN. family to him for the service rendered on Peterloo-Day seemed dragged in as a sort of extenuating circumstance. Clearly the Mr. Travis whose name and pretensions cropped up here and there throughout the letter would have been a more acceptable son-in-law in the sight of Mrs. Chadwick and his other sister, Charlotte Walmsley, and just as clearly it was made apparent that his paralysed father (hale and strong in ad other respects) was as much infatuated with the young man as was Ellen, having \" positively offered to take him into partnership on his entrance into the family.\" And even there Mrs. Chadwick felt \"con strained to admit that the clear head, business tact, and energy of Mr. Clegg would be a great acquisition.\" This item of news closed the missive, which must have gone a circuitous round of red tape it was so long upon its travels.

Meanwhile Jabez, who had crushed down in the garden of his heart those roots of his love for Augusta which mocked his strength to eradicate, did his best to plant and foster above them a grateful affection for the one who had chosen him, and hoped in time that the newer growth might utterly extinguish the old. His attentions to Ellen were more assiduous than, under the circumstances, might have been expect ed ; but he argued with himself \u2014 \" I must endeavour to atone to her for a proposal in which love had no part. She must never have occasion to suspect the truth. I should be a brute did I remain insensible to the unconquerable love she has so long cherished in secret for me.

She had been at first inclined to attribute his many acts of kindness and courtesy to friendship, and compassion for her failing health. And when he had spoken of being won by her many estimable qualities to seek her for a wife, she had listened incredulously ; then, overpowered by contending emotions, sank back amongst her cushions in a state of insensibility. Even her tremulous acceptance had been uttered as in a blissful dream, which might vanish all too soon. From time to time she perplexed herself with questions of the motive for so sudden"], [179, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 171 a change in one so steadfast as Jabez, and at last wavered between the two supposi tions that Augusta's wilfulness had wearied him, or that she owed her lover to pique. Of the real state of the case she had no inkling. She was not alone in her latter supposi- tion. \" A happy new year to you, Mrs. Clowes !\" said our friend Jabez to his friend the old confectioner, as at one stride he took the two steps to her confined shop on the bright frosty second of January, 1823, and extended his hand to her across the counter, where she still kept up a show of activity in spite of age and wrinkles. \" Same to you, Mr. Clegg.\" She had been one of the first to recog nise his right to the prefix, and with all her old-fashioned familiarity never dropped it. \" Eh, but now I look at thee, thah doesn't"], [180, "172 THE MANCHESTER MAN. look ower bright an' happy ;\" and she peer ed into his face inquiringly.

I am not marrying from any unworthy motive, and I think our prospect of happi ness is about the average. I came to ask you, as the oldest friend I have in the town, to be present on the occasion.\" Mrs. Clowes was overpowered. \"What! Mr. Clegg!

When the shop was clear, she asked where he was going to live after marriage, and was told with his bride's parents. \" Eh ! but that's a bad look out.

The shop was full. \" Stay, Mr. Clegg,\" said she, beckoning him into her parlour, and closing the door. \" It's hard cheese for a man to owe every thing to his father-in-law.

She was robing for a ball at the Assembly Rooms, and Cicdy, who al though cook, insisted on retaining her post as lady's maid on such occasions, had just fastened the last hook of a delicate lilac figured silk as soft as it was lustrous, with swansdown fringing skirt, sleeves, and bodice, as if to show how fair was the sym-"], [185, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 177 metrical neck of the wearer to stand such test. In came Laurence fresh from the Spread Eagle in Hanging Ditch, where he, a newly-elected member of the Scramble Club, had spent the afternoon with one or two others, forgetful that the origin of the club was the fourpenny pie and glass of ale, or at most the slice from a joint de spatched in a, hurry or \" scramble \" by busi ness men to whom time was money. Neither time nor money seemed of much value to Mr. Laurence, who was equally lavish with both, taking as much from his father's business and adding as little as could well be imagined. \u25a0 His step on the threshold caused Augusta to turn round, beaming and beautiful, and dart towards him, exclaiming \u2014 \u25a0 \" I'm so glad you've come !\" simultane ously with his \" Clear out, Cis !\" and a warm embrace which somewhat disarranged the dainty dress.

She was a something to admire and exhibit for admiration as a possession of his own ; and though her love had received one or two rude shocks, he was still a glorified being in her eyes, and she clung to him as a true wife should cling. She was still but a girl in her teens, proud of the admiration she excited. Disengaging herself, she cried \u2014 \" Oh, Laurence, see how you have crushed my swan's-down ! and now, dear, do make haste and dress, we shall be so late,\" and putting the fluffy trimming in order, she unlocked a small jewel-case on the table, and took thence the pearls she had worn on her wedding-day. \" What will you say for these, Augusta ?\" cried he, dangling before her eyes a gossa mer scarf and an exquisite ivory fan, whilst his other arm thrown over her white shoul ders again threatened the elastic down. \" Oh, Laurence, you are a darling !"], [187, "179 THE MANCHESTER MAN.

Guess !\" In small things as well as great it was his delight to tantalize, so he kept her guessing whilst he proceeded with his toilet, and she began to clasp her pearls on arms and neck, and in her pretty ears. \" Well,\" said he at length, \" who but your cousin Eden !\" \" Ellen ?\" She had gone so little near n 2"], [188, "180 THE MANCHESTER MAN. her own family that this was indeed news for her. \"Yes; I thought she meant to die an old maid, but it seems she's not too proud to wear your cast-off slippers.\" \"My cast-off slippers?

With the damp towel in his hand he struck across her beautiful bare shoulders with a force which traced red lines upon their snow ; then marked her round arm with a band as red by tearing away the suspended fan and scarf, which he threw behind the fire without thought of one either \" far fetched\" or \"dear-bought.\" \" Soh, madam !\" he hissed rather than spoke, whilst Augusta shrank from him in affright, \" soh ! you dare defend the wretch who played the spy on us at Carr \u2014 attack ed me, an unarmed man, with a stick, like"], [191, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 183 a coward, and left me bleeding there for dead, hoping to win the heiress for him self ! \" From her father and Cicily both she had gathered the truth of that night's exploits.

And there Mrs. Clowes sat and listened to the irrevocable words which bound Jabez to \" love and cherish \" the woman who loved him with her whole soul ; whilst in spite of himself his very brain was reel ing with memories of that other wedding day, when Laurence Aspinall and Augusta Ashton, now standing calm and beautiful"], [195, "187 THE MANCHESTER MAN. in the background, had breathed the self same vows before that altar ; and somehow the old dame had a secret misgiving when all was over that it was unot the reet one after all.\" \" All over !\" had been the cry from the heart of Jabez then. \" All over !\" was the echo now, as the last \"Amen\" sounded, and he registered a silent oath, not down in the rubric, to keep the troth he had plighted, although no electric thrill answer ed the shy touch of Ellen's hand, or the dumb devotion of her glance, and although Augusta's greeting of her new \" cousin \" jarred a stdl sensitive nerve.

It was the age for toasts and sentiments. Some smart and witty things had been uttered, but not until the cake was cut and commended, and a post-chaise at the door waited to convey the newly-married pair to Carr Cottage and the earliest friends of the bridegroom, did Mr. Ashton rise to his feet, snuff-box in hand, and with a merry twinkle in his eye propose \u2014 \" Success to the new partnership !\" \" Stop, my friends !\" said he, as glasses were elevated in honour of the toast ; \"perhaps I had better explain what is meant by the new partnership.\" \" I should think that was pretty obvious,\" whispered Laurence to his friend Walmsley across the table, but he changed his opinion presently. \" There are partnerships for life,\" con tinued Mr. Ashton, \"where the contract is attested in church, as we have had the pleas-"], [199, "191 THE MANCHESTER MAN. lire of witnessing to-day, and, I am sure, with the best of wishes for its success ; and there are partnerships in business, which are usuady signed, sealed, and attested in a lawyer's office; and it is to such a one I nowr refer, in conjunction with the former.\" He paused to consult his snuff-box, and smiled to see how suddenly inattentive heads were eagerly bent forward to listen. \" It may not be generally known that my dear nephew Jabez, at the close of his honourable apprenticeship, declined an eligible offer from brother Chadwick, in order to remain with us.\" (Walmsley and Aspinall exchanged glances. Mrs. Clowes looked knowing.) \" It may not be generally known that he has a small amount of capital invested in our concern at present.\" (\" Small enough, I should say,\" muttered Laurence.) \"Now, there being no likelihood that his son Richard will ever leave his ship for a"], [200, "192 THE MANCHESTER MAN. warehouse, Mr. Chadwick proposed to take his son-in-law Jabez into equal partnership, considering his integrity, his business tact, and energy to be equivalent to capital.\" \" Hear ! hear !\" in which Mr. Chadwick's stumbling tongue was loudest, and \" Suc cess to the new partnership !\" (The snuff-box closed, the bandana was disposed of, the speaker's beaming face was all in a glow.) \" Stop ! stop, gentlemen ! not so fast. You will have to fill your glasses afresh.

And now let us drink \u2014 ' Success to the new partnerships, matrimonial and commercial !\" Aspinall's voice alone remained silent amongst the enthusiastic cheers with which the toast was drunk.

You shad smart for this !\" An irrepressible ejaculation of pain burst from her. More than one turned round. There was real concern on the brow of Jabez as he asked \u2014 \" What is the matter, Mrs. Aspinall ? Are you hurt ?\" She made light of it. \" Oh, nothing, nothing. I struck my foot against a chair \u2014 that was all.\" But Jabez saw the white, frightened face, and felt there was something more ;"], [203, "195 THE MANCHESTER MAN. and that scared look haunted him for many a day. Laurence attended his wife to the staircase, smiling blandly whilst within sight or earshot. Ere he left her at the stair-foot he gripped her tiny hand till her jewelled rings cut the flesh ; and the smile became satanic as he whispered \u2014 \" You are discreet, madam. I charge you to remain so \u2014 for your life !\" Once in Ellen's crowded bedchamber she became hysterical, to her cousin's great grief. But she overmastered her emotion by a violent effort, excused it on the plea of recent indisposition, and was consoled by her mother and other sagacious matrons with the remark that such affections might be expected. The newly-married pair were Avhirled away down Oldham Street and up Piccadilly ; old Mrs. Clowes took her de parture, and then Augusta, acting on Mrs. Clough's advice, lay on the drawing-room sofa to rest. o2"], [204, "196 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Not until night did the guests depart, Mr. Liverseege being the first to retire. There was a late dinner at six o'clock, and when the gentlemen rose from their post prandial wine, and sought the drawing room, all considerably elevated, Laurence Aspinall was too intoxicated to move. The Aspinall carriage had been waiting an hour. The coachman and Bob the groom grew anxious and impatient about the horses. \" Mr. Laurence drunk ? Eh ! that mat ters nowt !\" exclaimed the latter. \" Steve an' me '11 manage him.\" And taking the limp young Hercules between them, they somehow hauled him to the carriage, and ensconced him in one corner, with his head drooping on his breast. Augusta shrank from joining him, afraid lest he should awake to malicious conscious ness on the road. \"Oh ! I dare not go home with him!

That night she rode home from Jabez Clegg's wedding feast with a groom and a drunken man, pondering whether spirited resentment or tame submission was her best course. The morning dawned on a wife pinched black and blue, with hardly strength or spirit to sob. Then followed a reaction, and a period of remorseful uxorious penitence, during which Laurence submitted with a tolerable grace to a lecture from Mr. Aspinall, who saw that something was amiss ; and chival rous gallantry towards woman being part of this gentleman's creed he did not spare his son. Nor did Laurence spare himself. He knelt at his wife's feet, called her \"an angel,\" and"], [207, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 199 himself \"a savage,\" implored her forgive ness, excused his jealousy on the ground of passionate love, lavished his means on extravagant gifts for her, and exhausted language in fair promises. But so proud was he of his wife's beauty that he must needs exhibit at theatre and assembly the jewel he had won ; whilst the admiration she had excited set his jealous brain on fire, and she paid the penalty in the silence of night, or even in the close carriage driving home. But his contrition and the old plea of \" excessive love \" for his jealous infirmity won her over, and not even Cicily more than suspected half his cruelty. Great preparations had been made at Whaley-Bridge for the reception of Mr. and Mrs. Clegg : the factory windows were extra burnished ; the landlord of the White Hart hoisted a flag ; the mill hands lined the road to greet them ; the"], [208, "200 THE MANCHESTER MAN. avenue gate was thrown open that the chaise might drive on to the cottage; somebody had put Crazy Joe into a new suit of clothes for the occasion, and he stood by the side of little Sim on the step of the Gothic arch (the greater chdd of the twain) to laugh and chuckle a welcome, as sincere in its way as the homely greetings of the orphan's fosterers. It was a fine stalwart young man, of open but grave countenance, around whom Bess threw her motherly arms, whde Tom Hulme helped the bride to alight, and mar shalled the way for the pair, who followed arm-in-arm into the house-place, where Simon, stiff with age and rheumatism, kept possession of the padded chair set apart for the sick or aged. In some way the knowledge that Mr. Clegg came as a master, and not as a servant, had preceded him. \" Eh, Jabez, lad,\" exclaimed Simon, tears of joy coursing down his cheeks, \" that"], [209, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 201 aw should ever live to see this day !

The occupation thus found for the mind and hand of Jabez at that particular epoch of his life was a blessing for which Ellen had need to be thankful in after-years, if she had but known it. As it was, she did fancy he might have given her a little more of his time, and not have needed her suggestion to revisit Taxal and the spot where he had wooed her for another, and not for himself. Yet a very slight hint was sufficient, and, taking advantage of a clear, dry day, the two re-trod the old path by the Goyt, which awoke reminiscences that could but be flattering to that self-love of which every human being has a share. Sitting down as man and wife on the lightning-scathed tree-trunk, which had"], [211, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 203 never been removed, he remembered the confession wrung from her agony on that very spot ; his arm stole round her waist in the pitiful compassion it evoked. A new emotion stirred within his breast. He folded his wife in his arms, and pressed upon her answering lips his first spontaneous kiss of dawning affection. Half-way home they were met by Crazy Joe, who had been sent to seek them. A consecutive message was beyond his grasp. All they could make out was, \" Back ! Sharp ! Quick !\" And, hastening on in alarm, they at length discerned Mr. Ashton at the gate, on the look-out. His pleasant nod was reassuring. \" My dear,\" he cried to Ellen, as they advanced, \" Dick has got his promotion at last ; Lieutenant Chadwick has been duly gazetted. Here is his letter to your mother, dated from Mai Stop, my dear !\" \u2014 Ellen had put out her hand for the thick, heavy missive \u2014 \" A communication which"], [212, "204 THE MANCHESTER MAN. called your old uncle Ashton out of his way to act as courier is not to be dealt with lightly. And before it is read I must know whether you would rather be Mrs. Clegg or Mrs. Travis ?\" Closer she clung to the arm of Jabez \" Oh, uncle ! How can you ask ?\" There was a sly gleam in the corner of his eye. \" Ah ! just so. That's it. How can I ask?\" But his face sobered. He handed the letter to his new nephew. \" Jabez, I think you had better carry it to your own room, for private perusal. I will communicate its contents to all whom it may concern besides.\" Jabez had deep feelings, though he was not demonstrative, and long before he had mastered its contents he was thankful for the delicacy which had spared him an open display of irrepressible emotion.

Bravo ! Nell, for choosing a brave lad instead of a money-bag !

Ben Travis! What strange coincidence was this ? \" His father had been a Liverpool shipbroker, and Ben took to me because I was a Lancashire lad like himself, though he was old enough to be my father. He had been pressed, and as I was the youngest middy, and he the master of the forecastle, many a time had he told me the sad story of his life.

His money was dwindling, and a birth was near at hand. He doted on his wife, and for her sake wrote to his brother, who was married when their father died. Ned wrote back, enclosing a"], [216, "208 THE MANCHESTER MAN. bank-note, and begging to see him at once. His wife had died, leaving a baby-boy, whom he had christened Ben, after his runaway brother. Ned said her loss was killing him, and he wished to leave his boy in his brother's care before he died. Poor Ben Travis kissed his wife, and went by coach to Liverpool. Before he could reach his brother's office in Castle Street, near the docks, he was pounced upon by a press gang, dragged on board a ship in the Mersey, and never saw brother, or wife, or home again. I have seen Ben's tears roll down his weather-beaten cheeks many a time as he told this. He was one of the first sent down to the cockpit at the battle of Trafalgar, and when Admiral Nelson's glorious remains went home to be buried, O ' Ben went likewise, to hospital, and I lost sight of him. When I was exchanged to the Excellent, Ben turned up again, hearty, but aged with grief. He had sought his dear ones, but a flood had swept through"], [217, "209 THE MANCHESTER MAN.

A man at a dye-works re membered something about an old woman they called stiff-backed Nan being killed by the falling house in trying to save a baby ; but Ben could learn no more, and his own impression was that wife, child, and mother-in-law had perished in the same catastrophe. He went to Liverpool. Death had swept off his brother ; executors swept off the son Ben, his namesake. He went back to sea, and I saw the brave Ben Travis drowned in trying to save a bum boat woman who fell overboard off Spit head. \" And now, mother, you used to be a good hand at patchwork \u2014 piece my story and your story together, and see if Ellen's poor cradle friend is not near of kin to your rich friend, Mr. Benjamin Travis, with quite as good a right to be called Mr. Travis too. \" I should have a rough sketch of the VOL.

Whatever of surprise or satisfaction Richard Chadwick's letter had held for him, a wave of sorrow had passed over soul and countenance for the sad fate of the parents whom he had never known. As his footstep was heard overhead, Ellen flew to meet him at the foot of the stair case, and threw herself into his arms. \"My love! my own husband !\" was all she said, but such an intensity of devotion and sympathy was in the act and tone p2"], [220, "212 THE MANCHESTER MAN. that he felt he had indeed a true heart beating with his, as he held her close, and his lips touched her forehead as a seal to a new bond. It was but a single step to the parlour door, which opened on a room all aglow with light and radiant faces. On Mr. Ashton's inspiriting, Simon's easy-chair had been wheeled in from the house-place, there being no stately Mrs. Ashton at hand to demur at the innovation, or whisper a syllable of class distinctions. And surely that was not \u2014 yes, it was \u2014 Ben Travis him self standing by the rheumatic old tanner, with both hands outstretched, to greet a new cousin in his long-time friend. And there was Bess, proudly glancing from his face to a piece of yellow paper. \" It's as like as two peas,\" she cried for the twenti eth time, handing to her tall foster-son a sketch which, though little more than a succession of brown smears, was a ludi crous resemblance to himself."], [221, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 213 \" Well, Jabez,\" said Mr. Ashton, sitting by the fire, with his handkerchief over his knee, after the first hubbub of congratula tion had subsided, \"it is as well our new partnership has not been gazetted.

I hope better things of you.\" A nod, a shake of the hand, and the gig rolled off with its occupants, and Jabez stood looking after them, hesitating whether to go back to the mill or to the cottage. The casual word of warning had come not one whit too soon. That which was send ing Travis abroad had kept Jabez close to business. He had not sought so much to dissipate thought as to circumvent it by substitution. If he had given his leisure to the cultivation of art, it had of late"], [225, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 217 been art only as connected with manufacture and money-making. Even his honeymoon he was casting into the mill as grist. He was very ready to take a hint.

I did not come to work, and the poor thing does need some compensation for the lack of a lover's ardour. God forbid that she should ever suspect that I married her out of pity, or that I should become a money grubber. I wonder if Travis thought I was likely to neglect her ? It is a thousand pities she should set her mind on me instead of him. And why she should passes my comprehension. He has every advan tage of face, figure, and fortune, to say nothing of his evident devotion. Ah ! women are strange creatures, and men are not much better.

I really ought to love her better than I do. But love can neither be forced nor crushed. Heigho !\" Back to Manchester they went, rather sooner than expected ; and then, though Jabez threw himself into business with a will, he bore in mind the parting words of Ben Travis. The contemplated amalgamation was effected, not without extra draughts on Jabez and his leisure. But as partner of a large firm, even though a junior, it was obvious he could not work, as designer for calico-printers, or for any other than their own house. Consequently, not being a man of pleasure, his evenings hung rather heavily on his hands, especially as neither Ellen nor he cared for the card-parties which formed the visiting staple. His very marriage had driven away his closest"], [227, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 219 friend, and broken in upon plans and schemes which otherwise would have found sufficient occupation for his spare hours. Other friends, however, dropped in for an occasional chat ; notably George Pilkington (to whom the wine-trade had opened a road to fortune), with his reminiscences and jocularity, broke in on the monotony of married life, that monotony which is as much to be dreaded by young couples as is a first quarrel. Ellen knew it not, but Augusta's image often and often rose up between husband and wife, and would not be driven back ; whilst Ellen's very caresses were a source of pain to him, so much he felt himself a debtor to her love. There was a void in his breast which she could never wholly fill ; he himself complained of a dearth of intedectu al recreation, and when Henry Liverseege suggested a return to painting, he fell back upon his advice. The fact is he needed to be alone, to"], [228, "220 THE MANCHESTER MAN. have a place where he could shut himself up with himself, whether to indulge in day dreams or to discipline his soul, or to think out the ideas of art, trade, or social econo my which floated through his brain, and were dispersed by actual business or fire side chat ; such a sanctum as had been his so many years in Mosley Street ; but self conscious, he had shrunk from making the proposal, afraid to wound his devoted wife by showing a desire to isolate himself. The young artist's open remark was enough for Ellen. At once a small room, or rather closet, partitioned off from a large one, at the top of the house, was set aqart for his use. He shelved one wall for books, set up an office-desk, carried thither easel, papers, and painting materials; enclosed the fly-leaf of his father's prayer-book within glass and a black frame, suspending it on the wall before him as a sacred relic, and there after warehouse hours he was wont to shut himself in, and almost forget"], [229, "221 THE MANCHESTER MAN, that he was a married man. But this room acted as a safety-valve. Luckily, in Ellen's eyes, Jabez could do no wrong ; he was gentleness itself in all his comportment towards her, and the love which had sprung to life unsought, and lived so long without encouragement, ask ed but slight return to sustain it. It was treason for Mrs. Chadwick to hint that Jabez was \" unsocial,\" or gave them \" too little of his company.\" She was ever ready to resent it with the reply that \u2014 \" If he is not dull shut up there by him self, I am sure we three have no right to complain of dulness down here together ;\" yet if we analysed her heart very closely there were longings and yearnings for his society known only to herself. It was judged advisable for the further introduction and extension of Ashton, Chad wick, and Clegg's business that one of the partners should travel occasionally as their commercial representative; and naturally"], [230, "222 THE MANCHESTER MAN. this duty devolved upon the active junior, whose capacity for the undertaking reveal ed itself not only in heavy remittances and a full order-book, but in a paucity of bad debts. Of course he travelled with a horse and gig for the carriage of samples, and now and then he would take Ellen with him on a short journey, an indulg ence which appeared to fill the cup of her delight. And altogether the marital yoke in a few months adjusted itself to their shoulders very naturally. It was during their absence on one of the earliest of these journeys that an event occurred which set the indignant blood of Jabez on the boil, and showed there was a fire smouldering, not extinguished. The Aspinall home at Fallowfield was an ancient, many-gabled grange, with mul lioned windows, recessed window-seats, expansive two-leaved entrance arched above ; noble hall, with trophies from the hunting-field ; grand staircase, with massive"], [231, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 223 carved oak balusters, flights of broad low steps, and wide square landings ; long corridors, three or four rooms of magnifi cent proportions, and clusters of little ones grouped around unsuspected passages and stairs ; open fire-places recently enclosed, and double doors to the chief chambers. Antiquity had set its seal upon the place, and filled the panelled rooms with quaint or obsolete furniture and adornments, as each successive generation had left its quota. High-backed chairs, sofas of gro tesque device with dim worsted-work cushions and covers, heavy draperies of silk or velvet, and tables with legs of all possible patterns. It had come to the former Mrs. Aspinall from her ancestors, and from her to her son on his marriage ; consequently this was the home proper of Laurence and his wife, although they had a suite of rooms set apart for them at Ardwick, and Mr. Aspin all would fain have had his fascinating-"], [232, "224 THE MANCHESTER MAN. daughter-in-law abide there always, instead of making his house -a mere convenience for visiting in town. Stabling and other outhouses were attached, the gardens were well laid out, there was a good quantity of grass-land, all enclosed within a high wall, and it lay away from the main road. Mr. Aspinall's carriage was a close one, for service as well as show. Mr. Laurence, on his accession to his mother's property and his wife's dowry, added to other extravagances not a like carriage, but a new Tilbury, and aston ished the crowd by driving tandem. Whitsuntide is the great annual festival of Manchester. It is the race week, the time when the Sunday-school children dress in their best to walk in procession and have excursional treats into the coun try. In 1823 Whitsunday fell on the 18th of May, when the hawthorn scented the air, and cherry-blossom snowed on the car riage which Mr. Aspinall sent for his *v"], [233, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 225 daughter-in-law, that she might witness from his drawing-room windows the inter esting spectacle on the Green, and preside over the hospitalities of his open house during the week. At that time, as now, Monday was the day set apart for the chil dren of all the Established Church Schools to assemble at the Collegiate Church, sing anthems, and thence defile in long proces sion six abreast, attended by their respec tive clergy and teachers, until they reached the Green, where the girls in their white caps and frocks were ranged within the enclosure of the Pond, the boys forming a dark cordon around them, and the crowd a motley one beyond. And then from the multitudinous young throats poured forth anthems of praise, in a volume of swelling harmony which hushed to silence the listening birds above them. Augusta, not in robust health, lay on a couch by the window and looked on ; her father-in-law watching her and anticipating VOL. III. Q"], [234, "226 THE MANCHESTER MAN. 1 her wants with the homage of old world gallantry, for young Mrs. Aspinall was becoming an important person in his eyes. Nor was Laurence much less attentive. He had been on his best behaviour for some time, and would scarcely let the wind of heaven blow too roughly upon her. At that period Manchester races were held on Kersall Moor, an extensive tract of land generously set apart for the purpose by the owner, Miss Byron. \" The glass of fashion and the mould of form,\" was the handsome man who patted Augusta's shoulders, and stooped down to kiss her, on Wednesday, the first race day ; but it was with something more than a shade of anxiety she saw him draw on his buckskin gloves, take the long reins, and mount his high Tilbury, with Bob beside him, and dash round the lower end of the Green at a canter. Evening came to verify her fears. Back from Kersall Moor came the tandem and"], [235, "227 THE MANCHESTER MAN. the tandem's master, but the biped was ebrius. He was in that stage of self satisfied elation which a contradictory word would change to fierceness, and the whim of the hour was to drive his wife to Fallowfield, and show her how dexterous a whip he was, and that not Ducrow could manage a tandem better than he. It was in vain she or his father pleaded her delicate health, the height of the vehicle, the shaking she would sustain ; he laughed at her fears, then fiercely insisted, and, not daring to disobey, she was hoisted to her perilous seat. In much alarm, Mr. Aspinall mounted Bob on a saddle-horse to follow. The roads were dotted with vehicles and people, the latter shouting and singing, or muttering tipsy oaths, as the fortune of the day inclined them. He proved his dexterity in guiding his far-off leader through all intricacies, but so close did wheel often come to Q2"], [236, "228 THE MANCHESTER MAN. wheel, that Augusta's heart seemed to leap into her throat, and her teeth chattered, although it was May. After they turned off from the Stockport Road at Longsight, they \" spun along at a rattling pace,\" as he said ; but she had to hold by the rail to keep her seat, notwith standing which, at the sharp angle by Birch Fold, the vehicle gave a lurch which almost pitched her off. At their own gate there was an abrupt stoppage for opening, their return being unexpected. Then the foremost horse refused to obey the rein and canter up the drive. Laurence plied his whip, which did not mend the matter, and but that Bob and the gardener were there to soothe the animals, and lead them to the house, worse might have followed. As it was, Mrs. Laurence Aspinall was half dead with fear and the shaking. She was lifted down and carried, almost in sensible, into the house. Cicily and one of the maids got her to bed, whilst"], [237, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 229 Aspinall himself, calling groom and garden er from the stables into the drawing-room, sat down to have a drinking bout with them. Presently Cicily put a white face in at the door, and beckoned forth Bob, whom no drink seemed to affect, and sent him off as fast as four legs could carry him to bring back a doctor, and acquaint Mr. Aspinall and the Ashtons that her young mistress was very ill. In less time than might have been expected, Mr. Aspinall's carriage brought to the Grange that gentleman, Mrs. Ashton, and Mr. Windsor, a young Quaker practi tioner from Piccadilly. A competent nurse from the Infirmary was on the box. There was no doubt she was in a critical state, but the immediate danger was ward ed off ; and though Augusta was not able to leave her room in the interim, the scent of June's roses came in at the open windows before her baby was born, when"], [238, "230 THE MANCHESTER MAN. penitent Laurence went into raptures over wife and son. For two or three days he hovered about the house, nervously anxious lest any sound should disturb the young mother. He saw that every domestic was shod with list, stopped the great hall-clock, and had the rolled-up carpets laid down on the polished oaken stairs. Four days sufficed. On the fifth he rode off to town on Black Ralph on a pretence of business ; but very little did Cannon Street see of Mr. Laurence that day. With every acquaintance he met was a glass to be drunk, \" to wet the child's head.\" At the Scramble Club, where he dined, he paid for two or three bottles of wine, also \" to wet the child's head,\" according to the practice of the club. Riding home, he stopped at the George and Dragon, Ard wick Green, and went through the same process. There some one remarked that he was"], [239, "231 THE MANCHESTER MAN. too drunk to stand, much less ride home, when he swore with an oath that he would show them how he could ride ; he and Black Ralph were equal to anything. And then amid roars of derisive laughter he flung out another oath, and laid a wager which was regarded merely as the boasting of a drunken braggadocio. ' He had kissed his wife's pale lips on leaving in the morning, and she had faintly implored him to be home early \u2014 she did not dare add, \"and sober.\" Towards nightfall she began to listen for his return. Hour after hour went by, and at one in the morning she heard the great gates and the door thrown open for their impatient mas ter by the watching servants, and the strong steed come tearing up the gravel \u2014 ay, and on up the broad, flat steps, clatter ing through the great oaken hall, and, urged with whip and spur, and a madman's voice, mount the freshly-carpeted stairs, cross the landing at a stride, and driving"], [240, "232 THE MANCHESTER MAN. back the affrighted nurse, enter that sick chamber where, with her baby at her side, lay the fair young wife, gasping and shrink ing with terror, and there stand with quivering flanks and panting nostrils, as the reckless rider on his back cried in exultation \u2014 \"By G\u2014 d, I've done it!\" He had done it !

Oh, Ellen, dear! that brute Aspinall \" He could get no farther. Feeling choked his utterance. She picked up the crumpled letter, and with almost equal exasperation and pain made herself mistress of its contents, in her womanly indignation and love for her cousin losing sight of her husband's excess ive emotion. Jabez left his journey unfinished, and drove back home with all speed. Ellen shared with Mrs. Ashton and her own mother the anxious watch in that large dim room, where the favourite of the family tossed her head from side to side, and muttered incoherent words. In the sudden emergency, Bob the old groom's recommendation of his own daugh ter as a wet-nurse for the poor frail baby passed without cavil. Not until long afterwards was it known that Sarah Mostyn"], [243, "235 THE MANCHESTER MAN. was the last woman to have entered that house, and on such a footing. One month, two months wore out before Augusta rallied, and Mr. Windsor, whose medical creed was to \"let nature take its course,\" pronounced her out of danger, and fit for the removal contemplated by her friends, and resisted by Laurence. Double doors, however, could not exclude outer sounds, and so long as she shrank and shuddered at every crunch on the gravel, every echo of his raised voice, recovery was retarded. So the elder Mr. Aspinall, exasperated with his son, and most solicit ous for the welfare of his son's charming wife, added his dictum to that of the doctor, offered his own carriage for her conveyance, and threatened to disinherit Laurence if he interfered. Once in her childhood's home she amended rapidly, but with increasing strength came maternal yearnings for her infant, still in charge of the wet-nurse at"], [244, "236 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Fallowfield. A hackney-coach was sent to bring Sarah Mostyn with the child to its mother ; but not a step would the nurse budge. She had no orders from her master, and the master paid her wages, and she \" shouldna tak' orders from anny body else.\" Messages wrere sent, and notes were written to Laurence, which he tore to shreds ; but he kept away from his wife, and kept back the chdd. At length she pined so much for her \" dear babe,\" that Mr. Ashton and Jabez together sought Laurence out in one of his haunts (a tavern near Cockpit Hill), to prevail on him to let Augusta have her boy with her. \"Mrs. Aspinall herself deserted her child,\" he replied, all the more haughtily that Jabez was Mr. Ashton's seconder. \"When Mrs. Aspinall thinks fit to return home to her maternal and wifely duties, she will find the nursery door open, and her son in trustworthy care. A true"], [245, "237 THE MANCHESTER MAN. wife's place is by her husband's hearth.\" \u2022 \" Yes, sir, when the husband is a true man,\" replied Jabez, with decision. \" And who dares to say I am not a true man ?\" retorted Laurence boldly. \"I do!\" promptly answered the other. \" No true man would have imperilled his wife's life by a reckless drive in the dark night in a tandem Tilbury ! Only a reck less madman or a ruffian would have forced a horse into a wife's sick-chamber, to drive her delirious with terror !\" \"And pray, sir,\" haughtily responded the other, \"how long has Mrs. Aspinall made you her confidant ?\" \" I have not the honour of Mrs. Aspiu all's confidence,\" answered Jabez sturdily, looking him full in the face ; \" such facts are trumpet-tongued.\" \" Just so,\" put in Mr. Ashton, drawing his arm through that of his partner. \" And the fact that Augusta shrinks at your name has spoken so loudly to us that if ever she"], [246, "238 THE MANCHESTER MAN. sits on your hearth again it won't be with my consent. \u2014 Come away, Clegg.\" After this declaration, Aspinall changed his tactics. He wrote to his wife, request ing her return ; then entreating it ; and finally went in person to beseech her to \"come back,\" vowing to \"atone for the past with the devotion of a life.\" The young mother yearned for her babe, the tender-hearted wife could not resist the appeal of the husband whom with all his faults she yet loved ; and, regardless of the previsions of her mother, or the entreaties of her father, she allowed him to drive her home to the Grange. Her first thought was the nursery. There she found, in addition to her own boy, drawing its sustenance from the nurse's breast, a well-dressed child, some two years old, playing with a wooden-milkmaid rattle on the rug. Something in the child's face and auburn curls made her ask, \"Sarah, whose child is that ?\""], [247, "239 THE MANCHESTER MAN. \" Mine. Whose should it be ?\" was the pert answer; and the boldness of the woman's manner checked further inquiry. But Augusta's heart had received a shock which shook the pedestal on which her idol sat enthroned. For a short pace Laurence kept terms with his wife ; and before her father or strangers he was her most devoted slave, but she underwent a species of slow torture in secret. She soon found that Sarah Mostyn was mistress of the house as well as of the nursery, and that Sarah Mostyn's child was of as much importance as her own baby-boy. Then he filled the Grange with his riot ous associates, and compelled his wife to do the honours of his table, though their oaths and* conversation overpowered her with disgust. And if one flushed with wine, or more bold than the rest, paid her a com pliment, or looked too warm an admiration,"], [248, "240 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Laurence was sure to find his way to her side with his common undertone threat \u2014 \u25a0 \" D n you, madam, you shall smart for this !\" \u2014 a threat always accompanied with sly pinches, which left their marks beneath her sleeves. Then, straightway, \"my dear,\" or \"my love\" would be asked, in the blandest of tones, to sing a song, play a rondo, or perform some act of courtesy for the very guest who had excited his jealousy. They had few lady visitors. The neigh bourhood was remote from town, and sparsely inhabited. Mr. Laurence Aspin all's reputation was as a yellow flag to warn gentlewomen who had daughters or husbands to lose against close intimacy with their neighbours of the Grange. Pity ing the isolation of one so formed to adorn society, Mr. Aspinall gave mixed parties at Ardwick Green, in the name of Mrs. Laurence, when the splendour of her attire and the assiduous attention of her husband"], [249, "241 THE MANCHESTER MAN. set rumour to contradict rumour. But save on an occasional family gathering she saw few of her own sex at Fallowfield. And her position in her own home was rendered intolerable by the continued presence of Sarah Mostyn, who at first familiar, then impertinent, had become at last openly defiant. It was not until all efforts to keep the nurse in her proper place had failed that Augusta appealed to Laurence to discharge her, the woman having refused to take a dismissal from anyone but her master. \" Tchut !\" said he, \" I'll soon settle that business !\" and forthwith stalked to the nursery, whence his voice was heard in loud command ; but the result was not the woman's removal, only a temporary sub mission, to be followed by fresh rebellion, and the confirmation of Augusta's worst suspicions. How often did the aggrieved wife thenrecall her thoughtless declaration to her mother, that her \"husband's heart must VOL. III. v R"], [250, "242 THE MANCHESTER MAN. hold her, and her only,\" not even business to share in its possession ! And how thank ful she would have been to have had no rival then but business ! She was finding the bed she had made for herself a wofully hard one ; but she did not succumb readily, she had high spirits and a buoyant nature, and would hardly admit to herself how much she suffered or how great a mistake she had made. But Cicily, that most faithful of faithful followers, cognisant of her mistress's wrongs long before her mistress, paid Sarah Mostyn off in her own coin on various occasions, and took care that through one means or other the Ashtons should know what a life their darling led. Amongst his other little peculiarities Mr. Laurence was an epicure ; and one of his favourite tid-bits was that spongy lining of a goose's frame known as the soul. It chanced at a family dinner, rather more than a year after Augusta's return home,"], [251, "243 THE MANCHESTER MAN. that a fine stubble goose formed part of the bill of fare ; and Cicily, who had long owed jhim a grudge for his heartless treat ment of her young mistress, determined to pay him off, and expose him before the whole company. A good caterer for a dainty palate, Cicily knew her power and privileges, but in this case she overshot the mark. One of the accomplishments of that generation was dexterous carving, and Laurence prided himself on being able to dismember a large fowl without once shifting his fork. The goose was set before himself, and duly helped, but, lo ! when his knife would fain have extracted his favourite morsel it scraped bare bones. The flat bell-rope was pulled violently. Cicily was summoned, and Cicily, in clean linen cap and apron, stood in the doorway curtseying respectfully. \" What have you done with the soul of r2"], [252, "244 THE MANCHESTER MAN. this goose ?\" he demanded, in a tone of sup pressed passion. Cicily came a step or two forward with an aspect of marvellous innocence. \" Eh, sir, it's not a goose, it's a gonder, and gonders have no souls.\" Scarcely an individual present but took the covert inuendo, and glances were ex changed across the board ; but the look he O ' shot at the woman as, incapable of speech, he waved her to retire, was one never to be forgotten, so much demoniac wrath was O ' concentrated therein.\" From the time when Jabez was acknow ledged on 'Change as a Manchester man, was admitted into Manchester \" society,\" and had absolutely become a member of the same family as his son, Mr. Aspinall punc tiliously invited him with his wife; and Laurence, with widely different feelings, followed suit. It was not until after the noble exploit to which Augusta so nearly fell a sacrifice"], [253, "245 THE MANCHESTER MAN. that Mr. Clegg could be induced so far to listen to Ellen's desire for conciliation, \" now that they were all of one family,\" as to accept one of these invitations. After that event he was of Mrs. Ashton's mind that, \" as offenders never pardon,\" Augusta needed a friend to watch over her. So he left his books, and his brushes, and his schemes for the class amongst whom he had been reared, and (believing his growing affection for his wife, and the babe she had borne him, a sufficient guarantee to his own heart for his own good faith,) when the Aspinalls invited he accepted. As previously stated, Augusta had not dropped into tame submission all at once ; her old wilfulness would have way at times ; and the light shafts of her satire were frequently aimed with effect against her recalcitrant lord. More than once Jabez had averted disastrous consequences by checking her vivacity ere it went too far. But never had he been so thankful for his"], [254, "246 THE MANCHESTER MAN. self-appointed guardianship as on the night when Cicily thought to pay back her dar ling's wrongs. To his surprise and pleasure, Ben Travis, just returned from the Continent, was of the party. He had not yet caUed on the family in Oldham Street, and Jabez never asked him wherefore. The cousins had much to talk over, and whilst Laurence Aspinall was pouring wine on his wrath, they discussed a project in which Jabez took an interested part, and which event uated the following year in the Manchester Mechanics' Institution. But through all their discussion Jabez never once lost sight of Laurence, and from his excessively polite manner to her he augured ill for Augusta when the restraining presence of friends was removed. He communicated his fears to Travis, and when the good byes were said, and the various convey ances rolled out of the great gates, a fee to Luke the gardener, who was also gatekeeper,"], [255, "247 THE MANCHESTER MAN. kept them open. A whispered word was sufficient for those who had seen the look Laurence directed across the dinner-table from Cicily to his wife, and who knew the character and disposition of the man. Mr. Travis's gig and the Ashtons' hack ney-coach were kept in waiting close at hand, Mrs. Ashton and Ellen, well wrapped up within, waiting anxiously for they knew not what. Back towards the closed house went Mr. Ashton and the cousins, treading carefully over the gravel. There was a flagged footway round the building, and from the windows of dining and drawing-rooms lights were still streaming. The last owner had lowered the middle window of the drawing-room as a door of access to the lawn. As if by accident the curtains had been dragged a little aside in each apartment, and now there were watchers at the aper tures. The elder Mr. Aspinall had made"], [256, "248 THE MANCHESTER MAN. an excuse and retired to bed early. Au gusta, with a shawl wrapped round her, sat weeping on a sofa in the drawing-room, afraid to go to bed. High words had evi dently passed whilst those outside had made their arrangements at the gate. Presently into the dining-room sauntered Laurence, with his arm round the shoul ders of Sarah Mostyn the shameless nurse. They sat down to the supper-table ; he poured out wine into a goblet, and they drank from the same glass, he fed her with delicacies, and kissed and caressed her with an assured familiarity which told it was no new experience. Long they lingered drinking and dally ing, and the watchers might have thought no danger need be apprehended. Sudden ly a word of the woman's, like a match to petroleum, set the whole man ablaze. He rushed from the room with a loud oath, the woman after him, apparently in alarm. The movement her friends made outside in"], [257, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 249 gaining the other window caused Augusta to raise her beautiful head, and at that moment her husband stood before her brandishing his cavalry sabre, and with his eyeballs glaring, fiercely vociferating, \" I'll teach you, madam, to set my servants to insult me ! \" he made a fearful slash at her. As she sprang aside with a terrified shriek, the old woodwork of the glass-door gave way, and before the tipsy madman could recover his guard to strike a fresh blow, his sabre was wrenched from him, and himself struggling in the grasp of three powerful men, his own gardener being one. Poor Mr. Ashton's care was his stricken child, whose white shoulders, bathed in blood, were washed by a father's tears. Thankful then was Jabez to have been at hand, and on the alert, with so powerful an ally as Travis ; thankful to have saved Augusta's life at any sacrifice of personal feeling ; and only himself could tell what"], [258, "250 THE MANCHESTER MAN. his presence under that roof cost him. Even Laurence had no inkling of it ; the marriage of Jabez had closed his jealous eyes. But now, finding in his old opponent an unseen watcher over his wife \u2014 her defender when he had least expected, \u2014 his baffled rage was something terrible to look upon. He fought, struggled, vocife rated, threatened, and foamed at the mouth ; and Mr. Aspinall, coming thither, in his dressing-gown, aroused by the uproar, could barely master his indignation and disgust as he ordered the men-servants, crowding in half dressed, to \" help to bind that murder ous maniac down !\" It was well, too, that Mrs. Ashton and Ellen were close at hand, and a vehicle ready to despatch for a surgeon, for Augusta needed all their care. Before three days were over there was a little coffin in the house, holding a stfll born child, and there was a young mother,"], [259, "251 THE MANCHESTER MAN. with a plaistered shoulder, lying, white as her pillow, in a state of coma. Dr. Windsor having exercised his best skill, as was his wont, left nature to do the rest, and youth and nature, between them, did their work effectually. Fain would Mr. Ashton have removed his child once and for- all. He offered to set up a carriage for her, if she would but leave her husband, and seek a legal sepa ration, insisting that she owed a duty to herself, as well as to her husband. Mr. Aspinall himself begged that she would take up her abode with him, at Ardwick, if only for her own security. He had ceased to find excuses for his son, and his son's charming wife stood high in his esteem. But Laurence had been beforehand, and, with plausible promises and peniten tial tears, and an adroit parade of her little Willie, also in tears \" for Mamma,\" won her over to forgive, and to give him"], [260, "252 THE MANCHESTER MAN. another trial ; and not all Mr. Ashton's eloquence, or Mrs. Ashton's proverbial battery, could win her from her decision. \" My dear mother,\" said she, \" remember you told me ' what could not be cured must be endured,' and that ' as I made my bed so must I lie.' It is a long lane, mother, that has never a turn, I have heard you say many a time ; and who knows but Laurence may take a turn now, and reform ? At all events, it is my duty to give him a fair trial, and keep my own wayward nature in check, so as not to provoke him ; and I must not leave Willie with that woman. I think Mr. Clegg would say I am right.\" I am afraid she overrated Mr. Clegg's magnanimity much as she overrated her wild husband's promised reformation, for her decision struck a pang in the heart of Jabez little dreamed of by Ellen. Indeed, it cost him a sore struggle to subdue his concern for Augusta within the bounds of"], [261, "253 THE MANCHESTER MAN. duty to his own wife, whose many virtues were gradually winning their way into his heart, and towards whom his attention never relaxed."], [262, "254 CHAPTER XIV.

He broke out from time to time, and his wife was the sufferer ; he horse whipped her, shot at her, and tortured her in every way that malignity could devise. No wonder that so many tiny coffins of immature babes should be carried from"], [263, "255 THE MANCHESTER MAN. the gates of the Fallowfield Grange. No wonder if Augusta began to compare her lot with Ellen's, and to repent her scorn of a true heart because of its plebeian origin. Meanwhile, the firm of Ashton, Chad wick, and Clegg prospered beyond expec tation, the business tact and integrity of the junior partner alike aiding the exten sion and stability of the firm. To make way for its expansion more warehouse room was required. The Ashtons, not without a sigh for old association, relin quished their house, and removed to an other, close at hand in George Street, little less commodious, however much Kezia might grumble at it. This was when Ben Travis, lacking employment for time, mind, and money, offered them to the growing establishment, and his influence as \" Co.\" was accepted. This combination of capital and energy, as Jabez had foreseen, worked wonders for them commercially, enabling them to tide over the trade distress of"], [264, "256 THE MANCHESTER MAN. 1826 with security and advantage. Long before then Jabez had offered to pay Mrs. Clowes her loan, with interest ; but she told him she was going to render up her account where, not the coin she had, but that which she had given away, would be put to her credit ; and so, as at first proposed, she made it over to her little godson, Joshua Clegg, before she was gathered to the great garner. But the universal mower reaped a heavier harvest in 1828, when he swept his keen scythe over the bed of the river. In 1822 Mr. Ashton (one of the first promoters of the Chamber of Commerce), notwithstanding his advancing years, took an active part in the formation of a New Quay Company, for the better navigation of the river Irwell. The company was established, quays were constructed, ware houses erected, boats budt, traffic was ex tended, and the town generally benefited. In the February of 1828 the axe, the"], [265, "257 THE MANCHESTER MAN. adze, and the hammer made a busy noise in the boat- building yard of the company, and sail-makers were active with their needles ; for a flat, destined to convey car goes of merchandise to and from Liverpool, was to be ready for the launch on the 26th, a day destined to send a thrill of horror tingling through the veins of Manchester, so sad was the catastrophe it closed upon. The launch of the Emma was an event in the annals of the company, and of the town ; consequently a large number of spectators assembled, a goodly proportion being admitted to the yard to take part in the ceremony, and go with the flat on her trial trip under Captain Gaudy. Mrs. Ashton, saying \" that when the cat's away the mice will play,\" had decided on remaining at home to watch the mice, but Mr. Ashton compensated himself by taking Ellen and her two eldest boys, leaving baby with its grandma ; Jabez, detained by busi ness in the counting-house, promising to VOL. III. s"], [266, "258 THE MANCHESTER MAN. overtake them before they were on board. Mr. Aspinall, too, was there, and on his arm was his son's wife, and Laurence, with his bov Willie, close beside them. He was too jealous of the admiration she excited, to permit her to go into company, even with his father, unless he had also his own eye upon her, especially where there was a chance of meeting Jabez Clegg. He brought the boy for a treat. It was quite a gala-day, and as the pleas ant company mounted the deck, peered into the cabin, and chatted gady to one another, they little thought to how many that would be a launch into eternity. The boat, a large flat, fully rigged, painted white above the water-line, and black below, with sails set and flags flying, rested in well-greased cradles, her head down ; the shipwrights stood ready with their daggers ; painters with their cans and brushes to dab her sides as she slid past them ; a band upon the quay played lively"], [267, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 259 tunes, and (fatal mischance) the people on deck flocked to one side to listen. The sponsor, a Miss Grimes, with her sister and our friends, advanced to the bows. The word was given ; the ready daggers struck away the shores ; the boat began to move ; Miss Grimes caught firmly the bottle (sus pended by a ribbon), and shattered it upon the vessel, proclaiming, with that baptism of wine, the boat was henceforth the Emma. Hurrahs and exclamations followed. The bows touched the water, which splashed the faces, then lifted from. their feet the christeners and the Ashton party. The flat had dipped too deeply, heeled over on her croivded side, and sank with her living cargo clinging and fettering each other in the swirling waters, whilst shriek ing spectators looked on helpless from bridge and bank, watching others braver and bolder, or better skilled, rush to the rescue to their own risk.

The bridge, the Old Quay, the open space in front of the New Bailey Prison railed off at an elevation far above the stream, the steep steps, and the towing path beneath, were all lined with spectators, though the fatal launch was made from a yard lower down the river on the Manches ter side. (The New Bailey is in Salford). As the vessel struck the ground, shud dering from stem to stern, before turning over on her side, and the final catastrophe was imminent, Laurence (sober for once) snatched his darling boy up in his arms, whispered a hasty word of instruction and confidence, and, regardless of aught be sides, sprang with him into the water in the contrary direction, far as possible be-"], [269, "261 THE MANCHESTER MAN. yond the eddy and suction, and keeping clear of the struggling wretches who were pulling each other down, swam with him to the towing-path. But not until he had placed Willie under safe charge, beyond danger from the scurrying throng, did he hasten back to attempt the rescue of wife or father; and then neither was to be seen. Mr. Aspinall had been an able swimmer in his day, and made a bold effort for self preservation ; but cramp seizing his gouty limbs, he was one of the first to disappear and perish, though boats and swimmers put out to the general recue. It was vain to search for individuals, but well was his son's prowess tested that day ; more than one drowning wretch he clutched from behind by clothes or hair, and urged forward to the bank, where the Humane Society's men, with ropes and grapnels, were ably seconded by volunteer humanity, and strong hands were out-"], [270, "262 THE MANCHESTER MAN. stretched to haul the helpless up Ben Travis had waited for Jabez, detained in the warehouse by courtesy to Mr. Gregson, the buyer for Messrs.

With the celerity of light, coats were doffed and shoes cast off, and the two leaped from the stone quay in hope and dread, but the good dog was before them, its teeth in a child's coat, swimming to the shore. Almost as Jabez touched the water, a sinking woman clutched his legs. With a plunge he freed himself, then, catching at her long hair, towed her behind him to the side, and swam back to seek and save his own wife and little ones, if that were possible.

Travis had the good fortune to rescue Mr. Ashton, but he had been some time in the water, and the old man was far spent ; but there was no trace of Ellen or her boys, even though he dived close by the sunken flat, and brought up lifeless bodies in their stead. Jabez and he could only hope some other of the brave men, putting their own lives in. peril, had saved them. The governor of the gaol had opened his house doors, the recovered dead were car ried into the gaol itself, the sail-maker's room was crowded, every tavern near was filled, but no trace was found of Ellen o: their sons, and Jabez was like one dis traught.

Even gallant old Nelson narrowly escaped falling a sacrifice to the surgeons. Jabez entered the room where Augusta Ashton was lying, to all appearance, dead \u2014 ordinary means of resuscitation having failed ; and a surgeon was about so to operate on her from a bleeding spaniel on the ground. Jabez shrank with a strange loathing; in an instant bared his arm to the doctor's lancet ; and if he did not give his life to serve her, as he had once said, he gave his life's-blood to save her ; and as the warm fluid passed from his quick veins"], [274, "266 THE MANCHESTER MAN. to hers, he saw the blue quivering lids tremble, light pass into the brown eyes, breath part the blue lips once more ; and from the depths of his anguished heart he thanked God as a faint \" Jabez \" indicated recognition as well as returning animation . He had restored a wife to thankless Aspinall ; but who should restore to him the darling boys who had crept about his knees and round his heart, and the good wife who had won a place there, in spite of fate, by her own patient, but intense, love ? The Emma was raised and floated, so little damaged that she was speedily ready for use, and continued so for many years. In her cabin were found the remains of Ellen and her sons, where the chddish curiosity of the elder one had doubtless led all three ; but they were raised from the water only to be committed to the earth, and covered up out of sight and hearing for evermore ; and never did Jabez know"], [275, "267 THE MANCHESTER MAN. fully ail she had become to him until he stood with Travis by the side of an open grave, and heard the clods rattle on the coffin-lid. She was all as one then to the man who had worshipped her, and the man she had worshipped ; and though the babe she had left behind was nearer to the one, it would be hard to say to which little Nelly was the dearest in the aftertime. Including the bodies found beneath the flat and those laid out in the gaol and else where for inquest, thirty-three lives were sacrificed on the altar of the Emma ; and of these must be reckoned the brave men who cast their lives away to rescue others.

He hobbled about the warehouse, snuff-box in hand, a few months, and then dropped asleep in his easy-chair after a game of cribbage with Jabez \u2014 never to wake again. And then the excitement and agitation consequent on the loss of his dear Ellen and her romping boys having brought on Mr! Chadwick a fresh attack of paralysis, which left him still more helpless (though he survived many years to pet and spoil Ellen's baby-girl), Mrs. Ashton, lonely iu her large house, proposed that her sister's family (Jabez included) should join her in George Street ; but when she would have said \"the more the merrier,\" the words died on her lips.

But there was another proposition from another quarter, to which there was con siderably more demur.

But Bess more immediately referred to the benefit Simon Clegg had derived from the Buxton Baths, whither Jabez had sent him year after year, for the relief of his rheumatism, and to his care of steadfast little Sim.

The latter will, though equally stringent, was a much more prolix affair. After a number of legacies, of which Jabez came in for one, Mr. Ashton bequeathed to his wife all other properties whatsoever he died possessed of, together with half his share in the firm of Ashton, Chadwick, Clegg, and Co. ; the other half to his beloved daughter, limiting the annual sum she was to draw from the firm, and which was in nowise to pass into the hands of her de praved husband ; and Jabez Clegg and Ben jamin Travis were appointed executors for the due performance of its provisions.

It might be that the river had washed the roses from Augusta's cheeks so effectu ally that her complexion had never regain ed its tone; or it might be that her skin looked white in contrast with the blackness of her bombazine and crape ; certain it was that Jabez was struck with the pallor of her countenance, and his inquiry, \" Are you not well, Mrs. Aspinall?\" was tinctured with alarm.

Yet in the integrity of his own heart -he had no conception that her embarrassment was the result of fear \u2014 fear of the interpre tation her jealous madman of a husband should put on so unwonted a visit. He thought he saw a smile of malice in the corners of the mouth of the bold woman who met him in the hall, and nodded to him so freely as he passed her on his way out ; but no prescient spirit whispered in his ear that his twenty minutes' visit on absolute business would furnish envy and jealousy with a pretext for foul-mouthed slander, for coarse vituperation, for the use of a whip, and for calumnious accusa tions which cut deeper than its lash."], [285, "277 THE MANCHESTER MAN. Cicily, who intervened to save her mis tress, might have conveyed some inkling of this to Mrs. Ashton, but Augusta absolute ly forbade her sympathetic servant's inter ference. \" You would do no good, Cicily,\" she said; \"the evil is beyond earthly remedy; you would only distress my dear mother to no purpose, and she has suffered too much on my account already. It cannot last for ever! On the next occasion Jabez was accom panied by his joint-executor, but even that fact did not save Augustas rom her husband's wrath, and his vile aspersions went far to drive out the last lingering sentiment of affection or regard she had for him.

Had not Laurence himself scored his rejected rival's name on her heart with his braces and whip-lash ? She shut the obtrusive memory out with a shudder, and, dropping on her knees, prayed earnestly for strength to bear and to forbear. Yet much of the cruelty of Laurence at this time arose from another source than causeless jealousy. He had been living far beyond his private means, and was greatly involved. He had calculated on laying his hand on a good round sum, and was disappointed. In order, however, to raise the needful, he sold his father's old established concern to their head clerk, far below its value.

The old law which preserved the woman's absolute right over properties legally settled upon herself, by strange anomaly did not secure to her one guinea of the coin those properties produced. Well did Jabez watch ,over Augusta's interest, but his heart ached as he saw her sad countenance, and the greedy triumphant eyes of ever-present Laurence when her dividends were paid in. For, before his very face, Laurence laid his hand upon the money, to squander it as he had squander ed his own on Sarah Mostyn and other dissolute companions, leaving his wife without so much as would purchase a pocket-handkerchief.

No wonder if each fresh act of personal violence snapped some bond between them, until the only one link to bind her to life and her husband was her boy Willie ; whilst the only human trait of Laurence was his fondness for his son, whom he was rapidly ruining with false indulgence, as he himself had been ruined. It was customary, when the hay-making season came round, for Laurence to gather such friends as his wife or he retained \u2014 the married with their children \u2014 for a frolic in the hay-fields, and the bringing home the last waggon-load in triumph to crown or inaugurate a feast. On these occasions he had the grace or the diplomacy to keep Sarah Mostyn in the background, though she flaunted bold ly enough about the house in the presence of his wife, and her child mingled with the children.

Merrily they came along the gravelled drive, under the hot sun, dreaming of no danger, Willie clapping his hands and calling, \" Look at us, papa,\" when, right in front of the drawing-room window, the pin which held the body of the cart down by some means became displaced, the cart tilted up, and hay and children were sent flying.

Draw we the curtain over consternation and bereavement, and pass on to results. If a change came over Laurence, it was not for the better. He drank incessantly, be came alternately moody and defiant, and added a coping-stone to his offences by placing Sarah Mostyn at his table by the side of his wife, and boldly avowing that her child was his child also. Then all the woman rose within Augusta, so long cowed and dispirited. She left the table, and, the insult being repeated, again retired in indignation. Of the servants none had pitied her so much as Cicily, but for whom communica tion with her friends had been cut off. Often had the former waxed savage over indignities she could neither check nor prevent ; but in many little ways the faith ful domestic was enabled to ameliorate the condition of her mistress.

When Jabez next came to hand over the quarter's dividends, Travis accompanied him, and then Augusta, in the presence of both her executors, demanded and claimed her right to a legal separation from her husband. Laurence, taken by surprise, started to his feet, then, resuming his seat, said, with a scowl and a contemptuous sneer \u2014 \" You had better obtain a divorce, madam, whdst you are about it.

They walked to Ardwick, and once there, though Augusta found sad havoc had been made in the place, all was her own, carriage included, and the domestics in charge welcomed her with gladness. Without waiting for even the show of a breakfast, Augusta hurried like a frightened bird to the mother's nest in George Street, where alone she felt secure.

Whilst, as if to refute him, when she took refuge with her mother, Jabez deemed it a point of honour to retreat. Accordingly he took up his temporary abode with Travis, in delicacy towards her, and as a check upon himself. No act, or thought, or word of his must give an evil tongue a chance to foul that spotless woman with its slime. In the midst of all this, Aspinall's embarrassments increased. Creditors press ed ; writs showered in upon him ; Barret foreclosed, and men were put in possession of the Grange. He flew to his old remedy, and it drove him mad.

Ten years had passed from the partner ship of Ashton, Chadwick, and Clegg \u2014 \u25a0 years in which money well employed had multiplied itself. Jabez was a rich man \u2014 a man of influence in the town ; no longer the amateur artist, but the patron of art, as well Henry Liverseege and others could tell. As he had been one of the first promoters and directors of the Manchester Mechanics' Institution, so was he now the supporter of the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Art ; and seeing farther than Mr. Ashton, who, as a member of the New Quay Navigation Company, had op posed the Act for a railway between Manchester and Liverpool, he threw his energies into the project, and helped to carry it, his cousin Travis working with him."], [297, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 289 His widowhood had cast a gloom over him for a time, but he left himself small leisure for morbid reflection, and that was cheered by the prattle of his little Nellie. Then came the crash at Fallow field, and when darkness set upon Aspinall and his deeds, light broke upon the path of Jabez Clegg \u2014 at first a mere ray, but he worked the more cheerfully in its light. It was not hope for himself ; it was merely a joyful consciousness that there was hope and calm in the sky over the head of their fluttering and wounded dove, and that Augusta could now rest in peace with her mother in the house at Ardwick, with no dread of a brutal husband bursting on them unawares. He came and went as friend and execu tor, but it was long before it flashed across his comprehension that the fearful ordeal through which Augusta had passed but brought his old master's daughter closer to him ; or that the prayer old Simon had vol. in. u"], [298, "290 THE MANCHESTER MAN. taught was being answered to the full. That which was \"above rubies\" had blessed his life and kept his human heart warm whilst his \"coast had enlarged ;\" he had been kept from the evil of a wilful and capricious wife ; and at last when he had resigned all prospect of setting the purified pearl as a star on his own breast, it dropped into his hand, unsought, un solicited. He had schooled his heart we know. He had married from a sense of duty and grateful compassion. He was a faithful husband to a true wife, and when he lost her he mourned her as a valued friend. But though all the early love of his being had been kept alive and in a ferment by the sufferings of Augusta, as an honourable man he suffered no word or look to betray more than a friend's sympathy. And still he kept as strong a guard over himself, though the tragic end of Laurence had set her free once more."], [299, "THE MANCHESTER MAN. 291 That last fatal act struck a sensitive chord in Augusta's nature. There was no exultation at release. For a time she lost sight of his profligacy and cruelty, and accused herself of having hastened the catastrophe by leaving him to his own un bridled will and the temptress by his side. She wept for the handsome lover who had captivated her young fancy ; she mourned for the besotted soul gone to its account with all its imperfections rampant. \" Let her alone,\" said Mrs. Ashton to her sister; \"the sharpest shower wears itself out soonest; she will come to her senses long before her crape is worn out.\" Mrs. Ashton was a true prophetess. For a long time the Fallowfield tragedy cast a shadow over the house at Ardwick, and they led very retired lives.

He scorned to importune now in his widowhood for the love withheld when they were both young. He counted age by events, not years. It was for Augusta now, she who had been taught by her very husband's taunts and sneers to think upon the true man she had set aside, to think of him daily and hourly with rapidly strengthening attach ment, and think of him as one who had dropped her from the book of his life for ever.

Little of the Manchester I have depicted remains intact, a whirlwind of improvement (!) has swept over the town, but old inhabitants will, I think, recognise the faithfulness of my descriptions, as they will remember many of the persons who come and go incidentally throughout.

I have endeavoured to do justice to a little-understood man. Many of his eccentricities are on record. At my own baptism and my mother's churching, occurred the scene which I have en deavoured to reproduce ; that delicate lady pushed and pulled about was a stranger to my mother and sponsors. A characteristic anecdote, which I have not met with in print, may not be out of place here. A printer, of republican tendencies, named Cowdroy, took his son to the font, and on the child's name being required, answered \" Citizen !\" \u2014 \" Citizen V growled Joshua, \" that's no name.

The house I have assigned to Mr. Chadwick in Oldham Street, was occupied by my maternal grandfather, John Daniels, and he was the paralyzed old gentleman in charge of his servant Molly, who, but for the timely interposition of a young man named Tomlinson, one of his own weavers, and Mr. Mabbott, would have been cut down. His daughters, anxious for his safety, looking out for his return home from the warehouse, saw from their open window more than I describe ; for one thing \u2014 a woman passed with her breast cut off ; the two vaunting officers who reared their steeds against the house with threats, were a cousin and a fiance; the man who was shot down in Ancoats Lane, whilst bidding his girls to retire, was, I believe, my Grandfather's tenant. The female sabred on the hustings was a Mrs. Fildes when I knew her. Her son, Henry Hunt Fildes, was in my father's employ ; and either that same son, or a grandson, is now an artist, not altogether unknown to the world. From Miss Hindley I had nine years ago the story of her father's fall. The author of the satire on the yeo- manry was my paternal grandfather, James Varley, of Pendleton. For the purpose of my narrative, I have antedated an occurrence in the Theatre Royal.

Blindness followed his long immersion, and when all remedies known in the last century failed, he regained his sight by swimming across the Mersey, as related. I owe it to his memory to say that he must not otherwise be confounded with the man whom I have called Laurence Aspinall. Chap.

M ' Celebrities I have Known,' by Lord William Pitt Lennox, is a book containing some highly interesting reminiscences. It possesses the piquancy and originality of the ' Greville Memoirs,' with a complete absence of the malicious observations which too frequently find expression in the writings of the late Clerk of the Council. The volumes commence with the closing years of the Regency, and the Prince Regent appears in a much more favourable light than has been represented by Thackeray and Greville. The other monarchs of whom we have reminiscences are William IV., Louis XYIIL, and Napoleon III. Amongst the warriors, wits, dramatic artists, and sporting celebrities with whom the author has been person ally intimate are the Duke of Wellington, Marquis of Anglesea, Lord Raglan, Theodore Hook, Tom Moore, Elliston, Mrs. Jordan, Miss O'Neil, Lord George Bentinck, James Morrell, Lord Deerhurst, Hon.

Yonge, Author of the \" Heir of Redclyffe,\" &c. 2 vols. crown 8vo. 21s. \" The author of this very interesting memoir was a French gentleman of ancient lineage, who left his home in Normandy to enter the service of Napoleon I. in 1S04, and, having distinguished himself in the Grand Army, retired from military life in 1833, and survived to witness the war of 1870, and the outbreak of the Com mune of 1S7I. The personal career of M. de Gonneville, as we see it in his modest account of himself, presents a number of points of interest \u2014 for he was an officer of no ordinary merit \u2014 intelligent, vigilant, and with great presence of mind. His autobiography conveys a lively notion of the French, gentilhomme of the present century, who preferred giving his sword to his country to leading a life of intrigue and inaction, and yet never forgot the traditions of hiB class, and the associations of the throne of St Louis. The most valuable part of these memoirs, however, consists in the light they throw on the great age of military wonders and revolution which passed before M. de Gonneville's eyes, and which is often illustrated with more clearness by the simple chronicles of eye-witnesses of events than by the efforts of more ambitious writers. The work contains some interesting details on more than one campaign of the Grand Army which have not, we believe, been dis closed before; and it adds to our knowledge respecting the struggle in Poland and Prussia in 1S07, and several passages of the Peninsular War. It brings us, also, within the presence of Napoleon I., and some of the chiefs who upheld the fortunes of the First Empire ; and its anecdotes about that extraordinary man are evidently genuine and very characteristic. It introduces us to the inner life and real state of the Grand Army, and lays bare the causes of its strength and weakness. The work discloses a variety of details of interest connected with Napoleon's escape from Elba, the Hundred Days, the Bourbon Restoration, and the Revolution of July, 1830. On the whole, readers who care to know what an honourable soldier heard and said of the most wonderful time in modern history will find in these pages much to delight them. We have dwelt at length on this instructive record of the experiences of a memorable age, and can commend it cordially to our readers.\" \u2014 The Times. \" The recollections of Colonel de Gonneville form an interesting contribution to the library of memoirs on the history of the last seventy years. M. de Gonne ville aims at giving a description of the principal incidents in the erratic life of a soldier who went through all the campaigns of the Republic and of the Empire. His style is very agreeable, and the variety of scenes through which he conducts us from France to Germany, taking Italy and Spain on the way, keeps the reader constantly interested.\" \u2014 Saturday Review.

OF HER MAJESTY'S TOWER. By W. HEPWORTH DIXON. DEDICATED BY EXPRESS PERMISSION TO THE QUEEN. Sixth Edition. 8vo. 30s. From the Times: \u2014 \"All the civilized world \u2014 English, Continental, and Ame rican \u2014 takes an interest in the Tower of London. The Tower is the stage upon which has been enacted some of the grandest dramas and saddest tragedies in our national annals. If, in imagination, we take our Btand on those time-worn walls, and let century after century flit past us, we shall see in duo succession the majority of the most famous men and lovely women of England in the olden time. We shall see them jesting, jousting, love-making, plotting, and then anon, per haps, commending their souls to God in the presence of a hideous masked figure, bearing an axe in his hands. It is such pictures as these that Mr. Dixon, with considerable skill as an historical limner, has set before us in these volumes. Mr. Dixon dashes off the scenes of Tower history with great spirit His descriptions are given with such terseness and vigour that we should spoil them by any attempt at condensation. As favourable examples of his narrative powers we may call at tention to the story of the beautiful but unpopular Elinor, Queen of Henry III., and the description of Anne Boleyn's first and second arrivals at the Tower. Then we have the story of the bold Bishop of Durham, who escapes by the aid of a cord hidden in a wine-jar; and the tale of Maud Fitzwalter, imprisoned and murdered by the caitiff John. Passing onwards, we meet Charles of Orleans, the poetic French Prince, captured at Agincourt, and detained for five-and-twenty years a prisoner in the Tower. Next we encounter the baleful form of Richard of Gloucester, and are filled with indignation at the blackest of the black Tower deeds. As we draw nearer to modern times, we have the sorrowful story of the Nine Days' Queen, poor little Lady Jane Grey. The chapter entitled \"No Cross, no Crown '* is one of the most affecting in the book. A mature man can scarcely read it with out feeling the tears ready to trickle from his eyes. No part of the first volume yields in interest to the chapters which are devoted to the story of Sir Walter Raleigh. The greater part of the second volume is occupied with the story of the Gunpowder Plot. The narrative is extremely interesting, and will repay perusal. Another cause celebre possessed of a perennial interest is the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury by Lord and Lady Somerset Mr. Dixon tells the tale skilfully. In con clusion, we may congratulate the author on this work. Both volumes are decided ly attractive, and throw much light on our national history.\" \"From first to last this work overflows with new information and original thought, with poetry and picture. In these fascinating pages Mr. Dixon discharges alternately the functions of the historian, and the historic biographer, with the insight, art humour and accurate knowledge which never fail him when he under takes to illumine the darksome recesses of our national story.\" \u2014 Morning Post.

THE FOETY-FIFTH EDITION FOR 1876 IS NOW READY. Lodge's Peerage and Baronetage is acknowledged to be the most complete, as well as the most elegant, work of the kind. As an esta blished and authentic authority on all questions respecting the family histories, honours, and connections of the titled aristocracy, no work has ever stood so high. It is published under the especial patronage of Her Majesty, and is annually corrected throughout, from the personal com munications of the Nobility. It is the only work of its class in which, the type being kept constantly standing, every correction is made in its proper place to the date of publication, an advantage which gives it supremacy over all its competitors. Independently of its full and authentic informa tion respecting the existing Peers and Baronets of the realm, the most sedulous attention is given in its pages to the collateral branches of the various noble families, and the names of many thousand individuals are introduced, which do not appear in other records of the titled classes. For its authority, correctness, and facility of arrangement, and the beauty of its typography and binding, the work is justly entitled to the place it occupies on the tables of Her Majesty and the Nobility.
