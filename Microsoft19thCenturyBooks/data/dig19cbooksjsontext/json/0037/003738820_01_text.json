How, from hatred to the Byzantine Empire, which had betrayed them to the Mussulmans, they admitted a belief of the Impersonation of the Deity, hateful alike to Christians and Mussulmans ; that of Ismaelians and Durzi. How, on the arrival of the Crusaders, the religious animosities and conversions ceased, by their replacing their Christian prince by a family of strangers and Mussulmans. How that family, the Tenhouk, having"], [8, "IV CONTENTS. been treacherously cut off by the Crusaders, a second line was elected, the Maan ; and five centuries later, a third line was elected, the Shaab, being equally strangers and Mus sulmans. So that, during these 800 years, political division and religious animosity remained unknown. How Mehemet Ali, Pasha of Egypt, sub verted the institutions and the liberties of the Lebanon, by constraining Beshir Shaab, Emir of the Lebanon, to become a Chris tian. How the Four Powers, who signed the treaty of July, 1840, called upon the people of the Lebanon to upset their Emir. How the Five Powers, who signed the treaty of July, 1841, by dividing the Moun tain into two governments of Druzes and Maronites, and imposing ruinous duties upon exportation, have brought upon it, in the course of ten years, four civil wars.

CHAPTER I. STRUCTURE OF THE MOUNTAIN\u2014 PRODUCE- INDUSTRY\u2014 AND SYSTEM OF EXCHANGE. Elsewhere man has cultivated the Land : in the Lebanon he has made it. Elsewhere the harvest is the produce : here it is the soil. Man collects and carries to the hollow of the rock the vegetable mould ; then hedges round with stones his wells of cunning fertility to conceal and increase them. From below 3rou gaze upwards at barrenness : from above you look down on an arabesque of verdure : the rosy hues of the fresh turned furrows, the soft green of sprouting crops, nestling within the pucker- ings, grey and brown, of layers of limestone cast up on end, the faces of which are worn like glaciers. This is their arable land formed on the central range. The rest of the Lebanon is formed of horizontally lying- strata. The masses break off rectangularly, presenting- wall-like abutments of interminable ex tent and endless variety. Taluses have been accu- B"], [16, "2 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. mulated below them, as at the base of ruined walls. Those banks and slopes, the faces of the precipices, and the hollows of the watercourse, are all held up by low walls five to seven feet high, the terraces seven to eight feet wide. These lines, stretching* indefi nitely, or winding round the valleys and sinuosities of the soil, appear, Avhen looked down upon from the peaks, as furrows, or as flights of steps, or as the seats of an amphitheatre. Here they seem an embroidery \u2014 there as the concentric lines of an engraving: re vealing eveiy happ}* fold of the earth, and shadow ing forth each bold projection of the rocks. Moving* along the hollows of the valleys, the traveller or in vader finds himself encased in a tahyrinth of fortress, each evolution of which is crested by inaccessible heights, fringed with pines, and crowned with snow. The soil so supported bears no crops, being left for the mulberry, the olive and the vine to feed upon. It is industriously tilled with the spade or plough. The cattle, adapted to their work, are scarcely larger than goats, and can turn in the nar row spaces with their toy-like ploughs, and scramble with them over the rocks. Each village has its cattle, and its flocks of sheep and goats, which are sent to the uncultivated regions in spring and sum mer, and brought to be fattened in the autumn on the second crop of mulberry leaves. Grapes are abundant and excellent, giving besides the fruit, wine, raisins, and dibs (the honey of grapes). The last is an important article of food. The olives are"], [17, "PRODUCE AND INDUSTRY. 3 sufficient for food, both in the shape of preserved olives and of oil, and they also furnish light. They have vegetables, tobacco, and cotton enough for their consumption. The mountain furnishes trees for timber and fuel, stone and lime for building, clay for pottery, and flints for muskets. Thus ever}7 house has sheep, cattle, orchards, gardens, vine yards, and, if not fields, at least furrows. In each establishment there is an oil-press and a plough, a wine-press and a shepherd's crook, a pruning-hook and a shuttle, a spindle and a spade, a Dibs vat in the rock and a copper dyeing-vat in the kitchen. Nor are the sabre and the musket wanting. Thus they possess within themselves means of indepen dence such as are to be found in no other community on earth ; and thence this Society has possessed the durability of the rocks which shelter them. Yet are they, of all people upon earth, the most depen dent upon external things. They have no bread \u2014 they must sell their silk to buy it. The seed of the worm is hatched by the women in their breasts, and the worms are fed in the cottages. The gathering of the leaves and the winding of the silk occupy in Midsummer the whole population. The tilling of the terraces, the repairing of the walls, the management of the watercourses, are the important out-door occupations of the rest of the year. The women spin the raw silk that remains, and it forms a considerable portion of their clothing. B 2"], [18, "4 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. Hence has sprung up an industry, not that of facto ries, of which certain spots arrogate the exercise, and a few capitalists absorb the profits \u2014 not that which divides men from the soil and so severs the triple cord ; but one carried on by the fireside, under the shade of the vine, along the lanes, one which with out interrupting domestic avocations, but only filling up the moments of leisure, clothes the family with out cost, and preserves to it its simple manners. The people were distinguished by their luxurious attire. Gold and silver tissues were worn by the poorest classes ; and the remnants which still sub sist of their picturesque costume is distinguished by its taste, original forms, and the pleasing* mixtures of colouring, in the dyeing of which they excel. The root of the s}'stem is the mulberry. It fur nished the bread, paid the taxes, clothed the people, occupied the family, kept alive the love of labour, the taste of art, the elegance of forms, conferred in dependence of character, and maintained the fresh ness of busy life among rugged precipices, while the plains below lay waste and silent ; picturesque prosperity filled with admiration the strano*er attracted to the Lebanon by the shadows of its still unbowed magnificence, and the echo of its lono* renown. These habits, still extant, and the enormous amount of labour during successive ages required to pile up these terraces, are evidences of a continuity of well-being from the earliest times, and the conse-"], [19, "PRODUCE AND INDUSTRY. 5 quent continuity of system adapted to it. That sj'stem was liberty of trade and exchange. The culture of silk was brought from China in the time of Justinian, who introduced it at Tripoli. But the terraces of the Lebanon, which then received the mulberry, were not constructed for that tree. Before its introduction the cities of Eden, Hadeth and Dam were fed. How, the Prophets and the terraces themselves inform us. Olive trees, though few, are scattered over the terraces both high and low, and the trees are of much older date than the time of Justinian. A plantation ofthem at Tripoli, attributed to that Emperor, are young trees compared with those of the Lebanon. The Olive is the physical document of histor}7. The method by which it repairs the natural decay of its wood induces a change of form in which, with experience, may be read the age of a tree as easily as that of a man, putting centuries for years. It is of so slow a growth that it never has been planted by a people that has been grasping, in times that were insecure, or under a system that was ignoble. The periods of such plantations are therefore very rare, and their eras not difficult to ascertain. The oldest traces that remain resemble fragments of ruined walls with shrubs sticking upon them \u2014 such may be seen in the neighbourhood of Smyrna. Those of the Lebanon belong to the second great period of plantation, which cannot be nearer to us than 3000 years. The greatness of human society is pre-historic."], [20, "6 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. These vegetable records show that the terraces ex isted in the Lebanon in the seventh century, such as now they exist. The people of the Lebanon had therefore then some other produce instead of silk to exchange for grain. By olives alone this exchange could not have been effected ; we must look for other produce as well, or for a greater relative value in the articles still produced. The Vines might supply wine and dried fruit, but could not have sufficed for their necessity, that pro duce not being peculiar to the Lebanon. Before the common use of sugar, and the enormous supply poured in from the New World, saccharine sub stances were scarce, and consequently highly prized and dearly paid \u2014 such was the \" Honey of Grapes.\" Jacob is careful to select the Dibs* to send to Joseph. Proof of the vast extent of this production in the remotest ages is afforded by the vats cut in the rock all over the country. The third resource was in the Musical Instru ments, the carving in cedar, sycamore,t and Tyrian ivory, so often referred to by the Prophets. The vines and olives must have been rapidly dis placed by the mulberry, for two reasons : the first the enormous price of silk ; the second, the facility of irrigating the terraces, which was no advantao*e in the culture of vines and olives. In the last * Our version renders this word \" Honey.\" Genesis xliii. 1 1. f This tree must not be confounded with that which in Eng* land bears the same name."], [21, "SYSTEM OF EXCHANGE. 7 century, the people of the Lebanon was wholly a proprietory people * so that there was no fictitious obstruction to prevent them from at once turning* their industry into a new and more profitable channel. Nor was there any fiscal obstruction, as in modern times ; the Lebanon never had its freedom of ex change interfered with. The customs of Syria were famed at the time of Justinian. The importance acquired by the cities of that coast, while so many signs of decay were exhibiting* themselves in the other portions of the empire, can only be attributed to the introduction of the Chinese tissue, which came to replace the glass and the dyes of Tyre, and to revive the activity of the ancient Ph\u0153nicians on the mountains, which had witnessed their rise and greatness. The Lebanon was included in, not subjected to, the Byzantine Empire, which, following the prin ciples of Rome, admitted no duties whatever on com merce into its treasury.* After the division of the Empire, in consequence of the facilities which the Straits of Constantinople afforded, commerce was interfered with ; but it is recorded of the very Emperor who introduced the silkworm into the Lebanon, that he restored freedom of trade. Had it been the system of the Empire to tax commerce, it would not have been very easy * The Protorium, or Voctigal, was paid into the municipal treasury, and devoted to the repair of roads, bridges, and harbours."], [22, "HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. 8 to have caused the inhabitants of the Lebanon to submit to it. They soon afterwards, besides, ac quired two ports of their own \u2014 Gebail and Patroun. The Lebanon never was included in the Empire of the Arabs j and, if it had been, their system resembled that of Byzantium and Rome, and, indeed, no other had at that time been known in the world. Of the Crusaders, the same may be said. They did not conquer the Lebanon ; and, if they had, they would not have dreamt of taxing commerce. There were duties on entering the towns introduced under the Ayoubites ; but the consistency which was given to the small kingdom of Jerusalem by Baldwin the Second has been attributed to the measures adopted by him, and are worthy of the imitation of the Turkish Government to-day, for they meet directly all the evils of the countr}'. He granted the pro perty of the land to any one who had occupied it and cultivated it for a year, and he abolished the duties on articles of consumption on entering the towns. The only tax which entered his treasury was the tenths. To the Crusaders succeeded Islam. The mountain was subjugated by the Ottomans under Selim the First with the rest of Syria ; but it was not until the reign of Murad the Third that the direct au thority of the Porte was there established. The three systems of the Greeks, the Crusaders, and Islam all coincided in this respect. The utmost"], [23, "9 SYSTEM OF EXCHANGE. duty ever imposed was three per cent. When, at a recent period, monopolies were introduced into the Ottoman Empire, the Lebanon again remained free from them, and the customs duty, by the dete rioration of the coin, was reduced to one and one and-a-half per cent. Thus the silk of Lebanon enjoyed perfect im munity from the period of Justinian down to the expulsion of the Egyptian troops and the restoration of Syria in 1840 to the authority of the Porte."], [24, "10 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. CHAPTER II. THE PEOPLE BY WHICH IT IS INHABITED AND THEIR NAME. Until England and France, in the middle of the 19th century, quarrelled about the limits of a Syrian Province, and the succession of a Turkish Pasha, the Lebanon knew no law save its own custom ; and, like the Basques, its people remained a primor dial society. The waves of conquest which succes sively flowed over Palestine, encircled but never rose over the Lebanon. Its children looked down on events in their course, races in their toil, and ignored history by defying fortune. The Assyrian, the Egyptian, the Persian, the Roman, and the Arab, have re corded their advent only with the chisel* on its rocks. The Mede, the Persian, the Philistine, the Jew, the Greek, the Turkman, the Crusader, the Tartar, and the Ottoman, have not done even so much. Its tongue till yesterday was that which interprets the names that have descended to us from antediluvian times. On its borders tradition has placed the tomb of Adam; it claims to hold the ashes of the second peopler of the earth. f * The Sculptures at Nnhar El Kelb. f Noah's tomb is shewn near Zachli, on the side of the Leba non, overlooking the Bkan, and just where we might suppose the"], [25, "ITS population. 11 What the Patriarchs spoke of as things of 11 ancient days,\" are still here to be found as familiar practice, and the metaphors of the Prophets are still illustrated in the life and customs of its people.* Here may be seen the rudiment of the Pyramids and the element of the calculations carried by the Etruscans to the west.J Ark to have been left aground by the subsiding waters. I cannot here stop to enter into the matter ; but the Lebanon is Ararat. The Ark was built at Bir, or in its vicinity. What could take it to the north ? The current, from whichever course the waters rose, must have oscillated between East and West. From Ararat the dove must have gone an equally incomprehensible distance to get olive leaves, and Noah must have travelled an equally incom prehensible distance before planting his vineyards. * The \" Exalted Horn \" is still the wonderful appendage of the married woman. It cannot be seen without carrying the convic tion that it is a practice which ascends to the remotest antiquity, and is therefore an evidence of the unbroken continuity of the people. But I have found a singular confirmation in two curious bronzes found in one of those ancient Sarcophogi cut into the rock of which such numbers are scattered over the Lebanon. The Horn is on the head of a woman whose costume is but a cord round the loins. + Volney first observed the cubes superimposed which are used as tombs. They present the very diagram of Lepsius in explaining his theory of the Pyramids. J The carat, or division by 24 in Europe, preserved in the testing of the precious metal, the weighing of gems, and the division of ship property, is in the Lebanon in common use. A man sells, not this or that field, or so many acres, but so many carats, i.e. of his whole property. The administration of the Lebanon itself is held to be a carat or perfect unity, and its 24 parts are always imagined."], [26, "12 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. The schisms of Islam, the heresies of the Church, Fire-worship and Sab\u00e6ism have here left their traces, and had history become the prey of moths, the Lebanon, as page after page was turned over, would reveal to the human mind the series of its own bewilderments. But the very reason why creeds were preserved was that races did not enter. The relics are of weakness that was protected, not of conquests that had been achieved. It was after the Druze religion was extinguished in Egypt that it appeared in Lebanon, and the mysteries of the Assassins, which Alamoot knows no more, survive in the orgies of the Nosairi. Nowhere is there record of its subjugation. Its monuments, often on the grandest scale, are refer able only to the earliest periods, and present nothing to which Egypt, Greece, or Rome can lay claim. Their institutions have lasted like the piles of Baalbeck : up to the year 1840, the labour of man was free as when Adam delved and Eve span. The sight of the mountain and its people at once suggested the idea that no foreign race at any period had established itself in Lebanon. When I came to examine, I found that historical evidence was not wanting, although writers will insist on inventing a people instead of seeing one.* * Chelibi Effendi, followed by D'Herbelot, peoples the Lebanon with Monophysites expelled from the lowlands of Syria. Aboul Faradi peoples it with Roman soldiers, called by the Syrians \"Audacious;\" with whom Michael the Syrian is pleased to"], [27, "13 ITS POPULATION. To a people its name is what title-deeds are to a landed proprietor. The name of Lebanon is a forgery. The true name \u2014 the name given by the people to themselves \u2014 is Sur. The race is the Surian\u2014 the Zvpoi of the Greek, and Syrian of modern tongues. The mountain is Gebel Suria. Lebanon is a foreign and a descriptive term : it means \" white,\" and is Hebrew. As it is the name they both use and cling to to-day \u2014 repudiating for their mountain that of Lebanon, and for themselves that of Arab \u2014 so was it the name it bore in the time of Moses.* That the Hebrews should have called it by a name of their own invention shows how strange it was to them. The Jews, 700 years later, did not understand the Syrian tongue.t The Jews wanted no interpreter with the people of Canaan. The circumstances which show that the Hebrews did not conquer the Lebanon, show likewise that the Canaanites had not conquered the Lebanon. Had the same race occupied the mountain and the plain, or had the Canaanites conquered this mountain, the exterminate the Mirdites, whom Le Beau brings from the north of Syria ; the Emir Hydar, the historian of the Druzes, peoples it with desert tribes from Nejid. * \" And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land which was at this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto Mount Hermon ; (which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Shenir).\" \u2014 Deut. iii. 8, 9. * \" Speak unto thy servants in the Syrian language, for we understand it.\"\u2014 Isaiah xxxvi. 11."], [28, "HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. 14 defeated and expelled nations would have retreated thither and made there their stand, which they did not, and they too gave to Gebel Suria a name of their own\u2014 Shinir. The people who, on the shores of the Atlantic, have preserved the names of \"Hivite\" and \" Amonite,\" and recal the event of their dispersion by \" Joshua the robber, the son of Nun,\" would not have forgotten and abandoned memory and name among inaccessible retreats and mountain fastnesses* overlooking their native land. This is certain ; that neither the Canaanites, when pressed by the Hebrews, nor the Hebrews, when pressed in their turn, ever took refug*e in the Lebanon ; which they must have done had it not been already occupied by a powerful and warlike people. The Canaanites and Philistines were themselves invaders. The land was occupied before by \"giants,\" that is, great nations ; generally known under the name of Anakim, from which the Greek name for \"king\" is derived. The impress of their character on the early world is not effaced, though the circum stances themselves have long vanished from the memory of man ; and to this day we commend a noble and a chivalrous deed by calling it by their * I found in the Lebanon no less than three villages named Ai Tat \u2014 the Hittites of Scripture, and a tribe still flourishin\" in Morocco. The name of a people would not be given to its own villages, but settlements of refugees would naturally be so called."], [29, "ITS POPULATION. 15 name.* Avim, Horim, are, besides, Chaldaic words, that is, Syriac. But the Anakim, whatever they were, when pressed by the Canaanites had not taken refuge in the Lebanon; for if they had, it could not have failed to have been mentioned. We ma}', therefore, rest assured that they also had been invaders, and equally unsuccessful against the Lebanon as their successors. Perhaps other invasions had preceded this ; but, at all events, from the date of the earliest extension of foreign races of which we have records, the Lebanon must have been inhabited by a popu lation equal to its own defence. It stands to reason that in the mountains will be found the earliest race of any country, and so much the more when in a country such a mountain as the Lebanon is found. The Assyrian in the eighth century before Christ did penetrate into the Lebanon. To this irruption we owe the first specific notice of its internal state and well-being*. They went to attack cities, and destro\\ed them, without, however, being* able to hold the land. Eden was then of sufficient import ance for its fate to be quoted to strike with terror the masters of Jerusalem, yet no Assyrian domi nation followed that event any more than when, sixteen centuries afterwards, the Arabs took and sacked the adjoining city of Hadesh. * The word \"Hero\" ascends to the Horim, through Greek, Etruscan, Ph\u0153nician, Hebrew, Arabic, and Chaldean."], [30, "16 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. Then followed the Egyptian, the Persian and the Macedonian conquests. At last the Romans came, and this seventh conquest of Judea left the Lebanon as it had found it, a virgin land. The operations of Pompey were confined to the destruction of their maritime strongholds. They were a people of builders living in fixed habitations. At the period of the overthrow of Rome 700 years later, they had occupied again the fortresses from which they had been expelled. When the Roman power was at its acme, Strabo speaks of the inhabitants of the Lebanon just as a Russian writer might to-day of the Circassians. \" The mountainous country (in the rear of the coast) is inhabited by Itureans and Arabs, all given up to robbery. The inhabitants of the plains are cultivators, and to protect themselves against the mountaineers they have fortified places of natural strength. The inhabitants of the Lebanon have also up in the mountains Sonnan and Bonama, below Bostra and Gigarton, the caverns on the sea coast, and the castle of Theoprosopon.\" For the first time they are here called by name, and that is no other than Sourian ; Iturea is also the name given by the Romans to the district lyino* between Anti-lebanon and Damascus, and confinino on the Trachonites and the Hauran, which latter the Druzes hold to be their original country. Aturea Avas the name of the province of Nineveh. In Hebrew and Arabic Athourean stands for Assy-"], [31, "ITS POPULATION. 17 rian. Xenophon speaks of the Sypoi to the east as well as the west of the Euphrates, and Strabo makes these extend, mingled with the Arabs, from Cilicia to Judea, Ph\u0153nicia, and the coast; just as to-day, were there a common name for Nosairi, Metuali, Druze, and Maronite, it would include the same districts. At one half of the interval be tween Noah and our own times we find the Lebanon occupied, not by refugees, but by a distinct people ; and, in the height of Roman power, in the centre of the Roman Empire \u2014 independent. Maronite, Druze, Nosairi, and Cadmieh, are that people, and it has dwelt in its present sites from the earliest peopling of the globe. c"], [32, "18 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. CHAPTER III. MILITARY CONFIGURATION AND STRENGTH. The Lebanon as limited to-day extends but seventy or eighty miles from the Akkar above Tri poli, to the Gebel Rehan above Tyre. But a much larger tract of country to the north, south, and east belongs to it. The valley of the Orontes, alone separates the chain from Allah Dagh, which joins the Taurus, and closes in Syria to the north. There a people of Lebanon dwell up to this day, and its in habitants were identified with it in its struggle of five centuries with the Christian Emperors of Con stantinople and the Mussulman Califs of Kufa, Bag dad, and Damascus. The stream of land, the Bkkaa, which divides it on the east from the Anti- Lebanon, and extends east ward and northward till it confines the desert, bor dering the district of Hauran, of 4 or 5,000 square miles in extent, is also occupied by the same people who there dwell in tents. Next comes the volcanic fastness of the Ledja, which it cost Mehemet Ali 10,000 men to subdue. The Nosairi, a branch of the Druzes, lie to the north of the Maronites ; they are again found at the southern extremity of Anti- Lebanon. The Metuali are on the northern frontier of the Bkkaa, at Baalbec, and they occupy the"], [33, "19 MILITARY STRENGTH. Beled Bscharre to the south, stretching as far as Acre. The Lebanon thus occupies a wide and varied region, within which are included strongholds and recruiting grounds, and wherein are combined the obstacles which the desert presents to the invasion of disciplined troops, and the strength of military defences against the incursions of the sons of the Hedjaz. With this extent of territory, and these resources of recruitment or defence, it possessed two no less essential, though negative, securities. Its figure was such as not to impose the necessity of its subju gation on the holders of Syria, and its nature was such as to hold out no temptation to the conqueror of Syria for its possession. It does not intercept the communications by land or sea of the continents and kingdoms between which it is placed.* Stretching in a double line from north to south, it affords three passages for those who, from the north, would invade Egypt or Judea, or from the south Damascus or Asia Minor. The range is crossed from east to west by two great roads, and the communications of the interior with the sea never suffered interruption. * In the expedition of Baldwin III. against Bozra, the capital of Upper Arabia, the Crusaders, instead of the direct road from Jerusalem to the Ea\u00bbt, found it more convenient, both in their advance and their flight, to pass across the Anti-Lebauon, which they never subdued. So in the Greek expedition of the Emperor of Germany and the King of Fiance against Damascus itself, they took the same route. c 2"], [34, "20 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. On the other hand it is a country which can neither be held, attacked nor invested. There are no passes which can be occupied ; there is neither a seacoast which can be blockaded, nor a land frontier which can be guarded; for by its extended lines, and the repetition in the Anti-Lebanon of the same circumstances, its borders are out of all proportion to its extent. An invader may any where be suffered to advance without compromising their defence; every terrace is a fortification, and every square yard a bastion. Gunpowder has in some degree impaired these advantages ; but when enemies could distinguish each other's countenances as they drew up in battle array, the stones of the loose walls of the terraces were a ready made artillery ; the he-. sieged would lose one wall only, to occupy another, and could retreat through a hundred stages, till \u2014 one crest lost \u2014 they had only to run down the declivity, and recommence the same operation in the suc ceeding* hollow.

The Empire oscillated between paroxysms of courage and des pair. The unaccommodating spirit of the Itureans alike defied the enemies and the orders of the Emperor.

Perchance they laid axe to the \" Cedars of God.\" Who can tell where the train was laid, or how ? The explosion came ; the Persians discomfitted, were pursued to the coast. The torrent of armed men which the Lebanon had hitherto held, she now let loose. A new people appeared, or a very old one re-appeared, on that stage which the world has ap propriated to tragedy\u2014 the land of Canaan. The appearance they made was not such as belongs to the incursions of a nomade people, nor to the expeditions of a marauding one. They evince a constituted and a formal society ; that character is substantiated, on the one hand, by the commanding part which they will be seen to play in the conten tions of the greatest empires in the succeeding cen turies, and, on the other, by the slender amount of their numbers. They are recorded as marching under Princes whose titles can be traced amongst no other race, Assieh* and Dalkieh. As we depend entirely on incidental notices in foreign writers, in an age that was not literary, and these belonging* to races animated with hatred to the people of the Lebanon, we are without the means of knowing whether these Princes, and the constitution which they represented, were of early date or recent crea tion.

What we positively know is this : \u2014 that, on the expulsion of the Persians, the Prince by whom they were led was named Joseph, and that the ancient halls of B3'blos became his court, which recovered its Scrip tural name of Gebail on receivings its ancient lords. Beside the colossal blocks of its now ruined towers, the masonry of Etruria, Greece, and Rome sinks into insignificance ;* to find a Western parallel for it, we must travel back to the grander and ignored periods, of which such records only remain as those which stand on Salisbury plain. With Joseph a second Prince was afterwards associated, Kesr (Cosroes), from whom the province of Kesroan derives its name. Their successor was Job, who consolidated the power of his people on its new basis, extending his sway over the maritime border, and along the valley of the Jordan, down to the lake Tiberias. The difficulty in the identification of this people arises, not merely from the absence of native annals and annalists, but also from the change of name at * There are single stones in the wall twenty feet long.

At and from the period at which we are now arrived, they are called Mrad and Mirdite, which is the same word, according to its Syriac or its Greek form. This name was subsequently restricted to the people of the Lebanon, but it was, when first introduced, the name of a Faction. In the year rendered me morable by the birth of Islam, a.d. 622, the people of Syria were divided into \"Marad\" and \"Melekite.\" Marad meant rebel or marauder; a term which the Crusaders imported into Europe.* In antithe sis stood Melekite, or lo}'alist, derived from Melek, King. In those times and countries religious doc trines were mixed up in every political contest, and arms decided the fate of every polemical schism. The rebellious character of the mountain, however, appears to have been created rather by the relations of the Empire with Persia than by any attempt to impose upon the mountaineers, who professed the orthodox belief in the two natures, the Monothelite and Monophysite heresies, then in favour at Con stantinople. Their creed had not conformed to that of the Eastern Church. Connected with it by their general faith and their political interests, no adminis trative relationship bound them to the Empire. The Emperor had neither afforded them support as allies, nor as Suzerain invested their Princes ; they had worked their own way, chosen their own chiefs ; * Our philologists are content to derive it from the Count de Merode of the Thirty Years War !"], [41, "MIRDITE PATRIARCHATE. 27 and the Empire, which did not acknowledge them, styled and treated them as rebels. The religious disassociation with Constantinople, together with the political importance which this people had now achieved, brought about the institution of a Patri arch ; from which time we have a consecutive ec clesiastical history, and therein complete evidence of an independent political existence. The first election was made by a General Council, with no foreign investiture. The choice fell upon a monk, named John, from the convent of St. Maron, who was thence called John the Moarni, (John the Maronite). Petroun was selected for the seat of the Patriarchate. The jurisdiction extended over the original twenty-four Carats or Mucatas, of the Lebanon. The convent of Maron, on the Orontes, had been founded by a saint of that name in the fifth century. During the Homousian controversy, it became the centre and the refuge of the orthodox belief; so that the name of Maron served as a distinguishing epithet for those opposed to the Greek creed. It naturally passed into the designation of the people on the selection of a Maronite, that is, a member of the convent of Maron, as first Patriarch of the Mirdites. At that time the terms Mrad, Mirdite, and Moarni were equally applied to the Sourians : the religious one, Maronite, has alone survived in the Lebanon; the political one, Mirdite, is only borne by an expatriated fragment on the Adriatic ;"], [42, "28 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. the ethnographic one, Sourian, is only whispered among themselves to some curious stranger ; when the rare incident occurs of the presence of a stran ger, who takes interest in them as men, and not in their factions, their schisms, their passions, and their crimes."], [43, "THE MIRDITES BETRAYED. 29 CHAPTER V. THE MIRDITES INTERPOSE BETWEEN THE CALI- PHATE AND THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE, AND ARE BETRAYED. Under Elias, the successor of Job, and who was styled Emir, the relations with the Empire were changed. Heraclius had beaten the Persians who, menaced by the Saracens, withdrew from a country now threatened by their advance, and ag*ain over shadowed though not protected by the Roman ban ner. Elias joined the Greek army before the dis astrous battle of Emessa, and if S}i'ia was then lost to Heraclius, nevertheless Elias retained Gebail. The Emir Jussef, not only retained but ex tended the possessions of his predecessor. His son Emir John, urged the Emperor by representation, as well as by example \u2014 for he harassed the Mussul mans even under the walls of Jerusalem and Da mascus \u2014 to undertake the re-conquest of Syria. Aroused by such audacit}T, the Caliph Moawiyah dispatched a large army into the Lebanon. We hear of no great battle fought. The operations, however, continued during seven )'ears. They did penetrate to the roots of the Cedars, for it was on the siege of Hadeth that their efforts were concen-"], [44, "30 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. trated. Each winter they retired, returning in the spring. In the seventh year they took and rased it. The Mirdites had sent appeal upon appeal to Constantinople, offering unconditional submission, and promising to accept as Prince any officer of the Empire. But the Emperor was bent on conci- liating*, not disabling, his foe. After the fall of Hadeth, and the devastation of the country, the Mirdites were considered subdued, and the Caliph could fearlessly prosecute his plans against Constan- tinople. Whilst Moawiyah was or.ly governor of Syria, he had prepared in the Port of Tripoli an expedition against Constantinople, which was frus- trated by the conflagration in the harbour of the fleet, and with it of the arsenal.* This feat was accomplished by two Mirdites, one of whom after- wards saved the Emperor Constantine IV. in a sea- fight, off the coast of Lycia. To another, named Callinicus, a carpenter of Baalbec, the Empire owed, about this time, the invention of the \" Greek fire,\" to which its preservation for six centuries has been ascribed. The siege of Constantinople, like that of Hadeth, was persevered in for seven years, when, without apparent cause, the Saracen army disbanded. This event was followed by a treaty still more extraordinary. The Saracens had suffered no de feat on land or sea; no fleets issuing from the Bos- * From this event Lord Byron took the main incident of the Giaour."], [45, "THE MIRDITES BETRAYED. 31 phorus had appeared on the coast of Syria, no armies had crossed the Taurus, taken Damascus, or invested Bagdad, yet the Caliph consented to pay tribute ! The world was astonished ; the barbarian hordes of the north, the distant princes of Italy hastened to make submission to an Emperor who seemed to have restored the greatness of the first Constantine, and to have bridled a power Avhich had filled Asia and Africa with its arms \u2014 Europe with its name. Before the Seven Hills could have been encircled with Arab tents, or the Golden Horn pressed by Sara cenic keels the resources of the Empire must have been exhausted. The key to the enigma must be soug*ht elsewhere. A Mussulman army had been cut to pieces near Gebail and four thousand Mus sulmans had been made prisoners by the Moarni. Thus is explained the retreat of the Caliph, and the treaty of the Emperor. The Moarni had recovered from their defeats, although these had been followed by internal dissensions, in the course of which the Emir Shneon was excommunicated by the Patriarch for admitting; Saracens and Greeks into the Le banon. Having repelled three attacks simul taneously mad a on their chief places, they had followed up their victories by descending into the plain ; and after annihilating the Saracen army the whole of Syria was again exposed to their incursions. The strong mountainous regions round Syria, and which intercept, on one hand its communications"], [46, "32 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. with Asia Minor, and through the Hauran with Egypt and Arabia on the other, were then occupied by warlike Christian tribes (many of them of the same blood as the Moarni) and as yet the Arabic tongue had penetrated into none of these. It may be easily understood how such an event should sud denly change the scales between the two Empires, althoug-h the historian mav have disregarded it as an event, or explained it as a fable. Could the Caliph have purchased the quiescence of the people of the Lebanon whom he could not restrain, the money would have been paid directly, instead of being transmitted to Constantinople in guise of tribute to purchase the good offices of the Emperor. The peace thus obtained was for thirty }'ears. The Moarni do not appear to have molested the Mussulmans during the short period that elapsed till the death of Constantine. He was succeeded by his son Justinian II., while Moawiyah also dying was succeeded by his son Yezid. The Caliphate was however torn by factions, and three competitors arose, Mochtar, Abdallah, and Said, who held out in Persia, Arabia, and Syria. John II. Emir of the Moarni, seized this occasion to commence a war of surprise and rapine, which now became the normal condition of Syria ; carrying off flocks and people, beating considerable bodies of troops not only within the range of the mountain, but on the very borders of Egypt. Justinian thus encouraged broke the treaty made by his father ; but as blind to the Le-"], [47, "THE MIRDITES BETRAYED. 33 banon in its struggle with the Saracens, as Napo leon to the Black Sea, in his war with Russia, the Imperial Court would not strike where its enemy was most vulnerable. The Byzantine troops were sent through Asia Minor to the far .East not to make war, but to commit excesses, and while they were toiling around and beyond the Caspian, Abdul Ma lek, the then Caliph, recovered the cities he had lost, and restored his power in Syria. The Greek Em peror was delighted to exchang*e a doubtful contest for a beneficial peace, purchased at the cheap rate of an act of treachery, and on the condition of relieving the Caliph from the incursions of the Marades, secured a daily tribute of 1000 pieces of gold, 1000 horses and 1000 slaves !* This compact was of course secret. The war continued in appearance. The patrician Leontias entered Syria with a detachment of his army and marched to the Lebanon, where his arrival filled with joy the Mirdites, who had so long* implored for aid in vain. Leontias brought letters of cong-ratu lation, and rich presents for their Prince. The Prince and the people overjoyed at being at length recogmized by the Empire, now indulged in the prospect of the speedy expulsion of the Mussul mans from Syria. The Prince assembled the chiefs at a banquet at Gebail, when the troops of Leontias * Writers have found it so difficult to credit a tribute regulated by the day, that they have fallen on the happy expedient of substituting \" week ''!\u2014 See Ockley, p. 44G, Bohn's Edition.

Leontias then succeeded in getting* the affairs into his hands, named Simeon, nephew of the slaugh tered Prince in his stead, and by rnone}', intrigue, and violence carried into effect his master's wishes, exhibiting a zeal for the Caliphate, which might have shamed its own faithful servants. The Caliph, if no match for the Maronites, was quite equal to the Greek. He had fixed the periods of payment for his tribute at the shortest legal term, twenty- four hours; having thus adapted so closely remuneration to service, he had to apprehend no remissness, no delay, and no half measures. The most warlike of the nation were removed to Asia Minor and Roumelia. On the borders of the Lake of Scodra, on the Adri atic, I have visited a people still called Mirdites. They are several thousand strong. They indeed know not their origin, and could not explain their name. Though surrounded by Greeks, the}* belong to the Latin church, and they still wear the Ma ronite colours, blue and red. An irremediable wound was inflicted on the Em pire, by this betrayal and dispersion of the defen ders of the frontier provinces on the side of Syria. The Mussulmans had become masters of all the cities from Mopsuesta in Cilicia, to the lesser Armenia : but exhausted by the excursions of the Marades had abandoned them, and these countries having become a desert served as the most effectual barriers of the empire. So soon as the Maronites were broken, the"], [49, "35 THE MIRDITES BETRAYED. Saracens re-established themselves throughout the whole of the northern district, and the heigrhts of Amaus and the Taurus served them as a fortress, whence to assail Asia Minor and desolate the centre province of the empire.* The dispersion was followed by a famine in Syria, a fatal blow to a population surrounded by foes, and at no time able to produce more than a small por tion of their own food. From this time till the Crusades the Mirdites are unheard of, and finally disappear to their very traces ; as on their subse quent unexpected reappearance, it is under another name. * Le Beau, Hist.

Passing over four centuries in silence, we arrive at a period in the history of the mountain, on which it is necessary for a moment to pause. When, in the history of any country, we come to the point at which a new religion is introduced, the announcement can be succinctly made, because the religion being* known, so are the circumstances which attended its introduction. Not so when the religion is itself unknown, and must consequently have been misrepresented ; when the circumstances of the country are unknown, and must also, there fore, have been misrepresented. If I have succeeded in showing* that in the Le banon existed one people, and that a Christian one, I shall have gone a great way to remove a false impression existing in reference to the Druzes, namely, that their faith is Mussulman ; for had it been a schism of Islam, it must have been preached to Mussulmans, or it must have been introduced by conquerors. I have mentioned the internal dissensions that arose on the occasion of the introduction of some Mussulmans and some Greeks, by the Emir Simeon"], [51, "DRUZE RELIGION. 37 and his consequent excommunication. Every Prince, on his accession, was required to take an oath that none should be admitted ; and the Patriarch, in like manner, was bound by oath to excommunicate the Prince who should attempt it. ' The Marada were in their mountain as a besieged garrison, and to admit a stranger was treason ; for it was to admit an enemy. Four centuries all but six years had indeed elasped between the dispersion under Justinian, and the in troduction of the Druze doctrines ; the one having happened in a.d. 694, and the other in a.d. 1088, the year of the battle of Hastings. It is incumbent upon me to show that the Marada had not been ex terminated by the disasters which had overtaken them, and their place supplied, as foreign writers would make out, by strangers and refugees. Of the four intervening centuries, two present external circumstances, identical with those which preceded them, balanced fortunes of Byzantium and the Caliphate. Then for a time the Caliphate pre vailed. But in the tenth century it lost its ground, and the maritime border was overrun with the greatest facility by Constantine VII.; conclusive evidence that the mountain was not at that time in possession of the Mussulmans. But if the Lebanon was not in their possession, then must it have been entirely closed against them.* An old ecclesiastical * The Emperor Zimces in his letter to the King of Armenia says, that the inhabitants of the Lebanon had submitted to him. \u2666"], [52, "38 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. writer of the Maronites says, that from the wars of Constantine VII. to the arrival of the Crusaders, \" the Marada were tranquil in their mountains and governed by their Emirs.\"* No Mussulman writer mentions the Lebanon either as subdued, colonized or converted. No ruin of a mosque exists save one in Kesroan, where a tribe of Mussulman refugees was introduced in the beginning- of the fourteenth century. In the distribution of Syria among the Ayoubite princes on the death of Saladin, no less than fifteen principalities are enumerated, indepen- dently of Jerusalem and Damascus, but no mention is made of the Lebanon. And, finally, after the dis- astrous defeat incurred by the Saracens from the Duke of Saxony, on the banks of the Eleutherus, the broken Mussulmans could find no refuge nearer than Jerusalem and Damascus. In the third century of Islam, the same intellec tual movement appeared amongst the followers of the Koran, as in the eighth century after Christ among*st the Christians. Islam was particularly a religion of injunction\u2014 it forbade to inquire into abstruse matters, it enjoined precept, and by precept forbade disquisition.

They had to pass years in suffering, abstinence and povert}r, in order to earn for the sect the merit of a good name. The subversion of human nature is to be attributed, not to reasonings, but to management: secresy and initiation were the means by which a few flimsy subtleties and insane extravagances appear to work out results such as only the most exalted sentiment could inspire. The process was first to raise doubts, then to en join piety. The neophyte was at one time broken down with prayers repeated fifty times a day ; at another, he was oppressed by engagements : a few only were advanced to the mysteries, and at each step new obligations to secresy were incurred.

The date of the Druze religion is A. H. 410 \u2014 a.d. 1043; that of the Nosairi is a.h. 270\u2014 a.d. 899. The former is supposed to have taken their origin from Hakim the Third, whom they recognized as God. Yet the two sects are so inti mately connected, that Mana, who is the first person in the Trinity of the Nosairi, is used amongst the Druzes to represent the \" internal sense\" of their dogmas. The Nosairi and the Karmates are the same; and the Prophet of the latter professes to be sent, from the Messiah, who is Jesus, who is the Word. Niebuhr mentions a Nosairi Catechism, which he had heard of, but could not obtain. M. Katafago, of Beyrout, has recently obtained it ; and from him I have had a translation.

Elmacin, after repeating* the adventures of Darazi, says, \"Thus was formed the sect of the Darazi, which became celebrated among men : the places where they are most numerous are Wadi Hin (Waddy al Teim), Tyre, Sidon, the mountain of Beyruth, and the adjoining* places of Syria.\" If the name had been derived from the man, the ordinary rule of such formation would have been followed, it would have been Darazieh. But the proximit}- which here appears is ovily obtained by changing the word ; the sect is not called Darazi, but Durzi. The name cannot, therefore, come from Darazi ; nor is there any evidence that he ever was in Sj'ria; but, on the contrary, there is evidence that he never was there. The statement of Aboul Mahasen, that Hakim sent him to Syria in the year 408, is that of a stranger, and on hearsay. The writings of the Durzi themselves furnish more trust worthy testimony. From them it nowhere appears that Darazi was in Syria, and it could not fail to be mentioned had he been there. His death occurred in 410, when, with many of his followers, he was beheaded in Cairo. He must have, then, visited Syria between 408 and 410; but in 408 he was at open war with Hamza. The contest continued until"], [61, "DRUZE RELIGION. 47 he lost his life. It is not then likely that he should have been sent to Syria ; or had he gone there, and been successful, was it likely that he should have returned to Egypt. But had it been possible for him in this interval, and under those circumstances, to have propagated his doctrine in Syria, and to have acquired such a master}' that the professors should be known by his name, how should it happen that Hamza, in writing to the Syrians, should never allude to it, or that it should not be alluded to in the numerous letters above referred to? AVhen the visit of Fakreddeen to the court of the Medici first gave currency to the name of Druze, the re semblance of sound caused the absurd derivation from the Count de Dreux to be for a time accepted by the learned in Europe. There is no more foun dation for the etymology which is to-day universally accepted by those who reject the other as puerile and fantastic. AVhence, then, is the word derived ? To any one conversant with the learned in the East, a very simple derivation will at once suggest itself. Tersi and Ders are words familiarly spoken when abstruse conversation or instruction is implied. Muderris is the name for \" teacher,\" and the Arabic root which is now translated \" to initiate\" offers the same letters. The characteristics D, E, S, are to be found in various literal and grammatical combina tions representing \" school,\" \" instruction\" and \" ini tiation.\" This class of sectarians represented them- selves as \" the Professors,\" \" the Instructed,\" and"], [62, "48 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. \"the Initiated.\" Durzi and Darazi I therefore take to have been terms in general use which came to be appropriated to the followers of Hamza, in default of any specific name. Common expressions not unfrequently come to be so converted into a name, of which we have example in \" Protestants.\" The religion of Durzi has an historic value, in the absence of other records, in this ; that it was a change which occurred at one period only. Spread by the most active and systematic proselytism it comes suddenly into being, and then as suddenly stops short. There are religions of place or race, and religions of doctrine ; the first have no thought of proselytism, the second exist only by it. AVhen each people had its belief, and each land its gods, creeds differed as languages, or were subdivided as districts, and no more were controversies awakened by their admix ture than by the simultaneous use of different tongues and grammars. Religions of dog*ma assail every other faith, and their extension is of necessity attended with those animosities which have infused the bitterest part in the cup of human suffering. In the Lebanon two dogmatic religions have coexisted for eight centuries, without having been accompa nied with the slightest taint of religious discord, and one of the religions was at that period intro duced as a novel relief. No where else has such a state of things been seen, and it is difficult to con ceive how it could exist."], [63, "DRUZE RELIGION. 49 AVhen fresh in the country, and under the im pressions prevailing in Europe as to the mutual animosities of the Druzes and Maronites, the follow ing words were addressed to me by a Druze Sheik, Said Jumbellat: \" I have been thinking what I could tell you that would interest you most, and it is this : \u2014 the Druzes love the Maronites, and the Maronites the Druzes, because of religion. He who has become in the beginning* Druze has become Druze, but no more can become Druze. AVe do not want to take away from the Maronites. AVe do not like to see their daughters married to Mussul mans, or themselves becoming* Mussulmans, from whom they must not make converts, and who make converts from them.\" This lig-ht I did not fail to use in the study of the past. I remained satisfied that Said Bey had put his finger on the point most interesting to a stranger, as being* the chief error entertained and spread respecting* the condition of the country. Not only have religious discords bee\u00bb wanting, but the difference between the two religions has been a bond between the two people ; for each severally is as a religious body, the object of attack, suspicion, or contempt to every other religious body without the pale of the mountain. This would be incomprehensible if Druzism had entered under the cloak of Islam, whether as addressed to a pre existing Mussulman population, or as a population of Druzes already converted. Considering the case historically, it is to be in- K"], [64, "50 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. ferred that Druzism must have been preached to Christians, a conclusion which its intrinsic character sustains. The Druzes revile Mahomet,* and have substituted for the Koran a book of their own, called \" Destour ;\" this is not and never was a se cret, however their dogmas may be. They are not circumcised, and practise in no respect the ceremonies of Islam. No Druze wears the green turban, a distinction which would not have been resigned had they been schismatics from Islam. They marry only one wife. AVhere dress is not subject to change by fashion at home or imitation from abroad, the form and colours of the clothing of a people become historical evidence equal to any that bronze or granite can supply. Druze and Maronite wear the same costumes That most striking and peculiar ornament, the Tantour, which only belongs to this race, and has belonged to them from the very earliest stag-es of society, is common to both. It cannot for a mo ment be supposed that this distinction should have been imposed by the conquerors upon the conquered \u25a0 still less that it should have been adopted from them.f Again, could it be that down to the middle of the last century, we should never so much as have heard of the distinction between Christian and * \"Surrounded by the Mahomedans, in whom their doctrines of necessity excited horror.\" De Sacy, T. 11. p, 529 t The Tantoura has recently been' excommunicated by the Maronite Patriarch as a symbol of idolatry !"], [65, "DRUZE RELIGION. 51 Druze, if the Druzes had intruded themselves upon the Maronite country. But the strongest evidence of its Christian orig-in is to be found in the legal view taken by the Mus sulman Courts, and I am astonished that this point should have been overlooked by those who have written upon the subject. The Druzes, supposing them to have been originally Mussulmans, were either renegades, and must have been pursued as guilty of a capital offence, which in no time has Islam suffered to go unpunished, or they remained Mussulmans ; in which case they would continue to be so held to the present time. But the Courts of law have always treated them as not belonging to Islam ; and a Fetvah was rendered at Beyrouth, on the occasion of the conversion of a Druze to Christianity, to the effect that a Druze might Freely become a Christian. At first in Egypt it was a schism of Islam ; it then proceeded to infidelity, and was cast out of Islam. In the latter form it reached Syria, and after it had been utterly extinguished elsewhere. Then it appeared as the enemy, alike of Islam and of Christianity ; precisely on that account did it find favour; it had no other claim. Let us ima o-ine Druze missionaries preaching disbelief in the two then contending creeds, and making converts on whom secresy was enjoined ; these divided into two classes, one being the initiated : and recollecting that the Christian faith was that of the Greek Em- e 2"], [66, "52 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. pire, at the time detested by the mountaineers scarcely less than the Saracenic\u2014 then the whole case becomes clear. The secession was concealed, the neophytes cautious, and the result of the conversion neutrality in religion as hitherto in politics. How otherwise explain the phenomenon of a religion spread by a missionary system, and, so soon as es tablished, ceasing to proselytise. Nothing is more simple than the operation itself. It is the perception of it that is difficult, because of our notions. AVe only see in religious conversions the influence of argument and the action of indivi duals, being removed from the period in our own country when conversion was effected in the mass. In such cases the result is determined by political circumstances acting upon the dispositions of men. Many other mistakes, besides this one, arise out of the erroneous supposition that men think. Thought must imply success, not attempt ; and requires quali fications and powers so extensive and high, that their coincidence and exercise must be the rarest of events in the history of the world. The operation is a solitary one\u2014 is an abstracted one. Movements of men belong to another order, and are determined by their own character; that is, frivolity and pas sion. I have myself been present on the eastern borders of the Black Sea, at the anniversary in a Mussulman tribe of its entire conversion in one day from Christianity a few years before. This was within the limits of the Ottoman Empire, the laxity"], [67, "DRUZE RELIGION. 53 of whose political bonds prevents it from suffering from the obloquy of Government. The apostasy was here determined, on the one hand, by the desire to exclude Russian emissaries ; on the other, to con ciliate the support of the Turkish Government. At the same time the character of Christianity was lowered by its being represented in their eyes by the Russian Government, and that of Islam raised as being represented to them by a Government\u2014 that of Constantinople \u2014 which neither schemed nor in trig*ued. Further to the north, similar cases have produced the same result on that other memorable mountain \u2014 the Caucasus, where Christianity has disappeared in proportion as the pressure of Russia has increased. In like manner it can be understood how the Maronites of the Lebanon were ready to embrace a belief because it was neither that of the Empire by which it was assailed\u2014 the Mussulman\u2014 nor that of the Empire \u2014 the Christian\u2014 by which it was be trayed. AVe may also expect this proselytism in stantly to cease when the causes are removed ; that is to say, when another actor appears on the stage and causes Byzantine and Saracen alike to be for gotten. Such an actor did appear, and Maronite and Druze reverted to their original harmony, not withstanding that they did now profess two different creeds. The above conclusions I further sought to test by the criticism of those Europeans settled in Syria who"], [68, "54 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. interest themselves in such matters; that is, the Missionaries. With all the available knowledge and disposition, they were unable to controvert any of the foregoing statements or arguments; their oppo sition confined itself to some trifling objections. First, that there is a discrepancy between the lan guage of the Druzes and Maronites; secondly, that the character of the two people is dissimilar; thirdly, that the Druzes preserve the Mussulman names. To these I reply ; first, that there is no difference in the language except as flowing from the differ ence of the two religions ; the Druzes adopting* Arabic terms, the Maronites holding* to the Syriac as their Church tongue, and indeed commonly speaking it until a century ago. Secondly, the difference of character was thus described to me by one of the Missionaries themselves ; \" the Druzes have some good points, the Maronites have none.\" The difference that does exist I explain in this way : the Maronites through their connection with Rome became at an earlier period than the Druzes corrupted by foreign influence. The Druzes isolated from the world had to rely on themselves. Thirdly, as to names ; if the Druze is to be held a Mussulman because he bears the name of Achmet, how have we a Bishop Halil and an Emir Hyder, Christians? The peculiar and striking feature of this country, the absence of all distinction, as con nected with religion, in dress, form of salutation and social station, is manifested no less in proper names."], [69, "DRUZE RELIGION. 55 Those fifty places which I have already adduced, as giving by their Syriac etymology the disproof of an Arab conquest, lie immediately around the present capital of the Druzes, Deir El Cammar. And as among'st these, some Arabic names have been intro duced which are descriptive and applying to places of recent origin, so in regard to the names of men, a slight modification has in recent times taken place, such as this. A Christian will not give to his child the name of Mahomet or Achmet, from a peculiar aversion to that name, since religious animosities have sprung* up ; just as the neighbouring Mussul man, when he has given that name to his child, ad dresses him as Sidi, even though an infant. The case we have been here examining* is as a proposition of Euclid, which rests not on a narrative or a description, but on inevitable deduction. That which had to be demonstrated, in order that any event of the Lebanon past or present might be apprehended is \u2014 that Druze and Maronite is one people. That has been demonstrated."], [70, "56 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. CHAPTER VII. NEUTRALITY DURING THE CRUSADES. AVe have now arrived at the period of the long convulsion of Syria from the Crusades. In the centre of this storm stood the Lebanon, and it is to be expected that above all other countries) it should have been thereby torn and shattered. But on the contrary we find it passing* through this epoch, motionless within, undisturbed from without. Its inhabitants looked down on hosts marching through in the confidence of victory, or flying in the panic of defeat. To them it was only a spectacle. Seated on their endless amphitheatres they could watch the struggles of the East and the AArest, and note their very countenances. Time cannot afford a similar example of neutrality and spectatorship so close, unimpassioned, unexpected and entire. This iron stream for more than two centuries poured over the Taurus, and issued from the sea. It surged and raged around without overpassing the abutments of the Lebanon. The Crusaders sought in every nook and cranny throughout Syria, Christians to enrol and Mussulmans to extermi nate. Wherever there was a castle, when in strength. they assaulted it ; and in discomfiture, wherever"], [71, "NEUTRALITY DURING THE CRUSADES. 57 there was a sheltering rock or pass, they claimed its protection. But in the Lebanon they -found neither victim nor ally ; neither fortress to assail, nor fastness to protect ; and followed the highway, whether victorious or vanquished, without ventur ing into the fields, as a turnpike road is followed by a dray. At this time the Mirdite population was not con fined to the limits of Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon the Hauran and the Ledja, but extended on the north to regions and positions, scarcely less impor tant for the Crusaders, if they could have impinged upon them. These were the mountain ranges above Aleppo, which crossed the path of the Crusaders into Syria. At the close of these two centuries, during* which the world was filled with Syria, and we hear nothing* of the Lebanon, an event occurred which O 7 throws a prospective light upon the circumstances of this happy obscurity. The Crusaders were finally driven out in 1302. Three or four years after, a trifling* disembarkation took place of Christians at the mouth of the Damour, near Beyrouth, these were speedily repulsed by the people of the Lebanon. But the Sultan of Damascus, either misinformed or no longer constrained to respect the neutrality of the Lebanon, charged the Mirdites with having invited their co-religionaries, and sent his lieute nant, Accoush El Essem, to punish them. A great battle took place at llabbellias, in the B'kkaa, in"], [72, "58 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. which the troops of the Sultan were utterly defeated. A commotion was excited in consequence at Da mascus, and to allay the storm a fetva was obtained by the Sultan from the Mufti, legalising the war on the false g-rounds that the Christians had been the aggressors. A fetva is a judicial decision ren dered on a statement of the case impersonally made on the part of the executive ; that is to say, the case is stated without names. In this instance the state ment would have been as follows : \" M. is at peace with the Sultan of Damascus. N. is the enemy of the Sultan of Damascus. M. invites N. to land on his coast. Is it lawful to draw the sword against M. ?\" The terms of the fetva would be, \" The sword may be drawn against M.\" This fetva proves that up to that time, that is to say, during the Crusades, no war existed between the people of the Lebanon and the Saracens. The transaction itself further shows that it was not because the Lebanon was uninhabited that it was either unheard of or unoc cupied. The retreat of the Christians had left the success ful party in undisturbed possession, but with a vast accumulative mass of warlike means; troops which had to be disbanded ; and predatory hordes of Tur comans collected from far and near, filled with the lust of vengeance, and the love of plunder. The Lebanon presented a virgin soil, and had inflicted a disgrace on the Mussulman arms which had to be wiped out. The Mussulman historians narrate"], [73, "NEUTRALITY DURING THE CRUSADES. 59 that ample vengeance was taken ; that its terraces were ravaged, its monasteries sacked, and its people dispersed. That this is an exaggeration is shown by the insignificance of the results, which amounted merely to the establishment of a small tribe of Turcomans. in Kesroan.* Taking together the narrative and the event, we may conclude that the Saracens were desirous but not able to subdue the Lebanon. And if they failed in the hour of victory, and with the forces in hand with which they had expelled the Christians, we may infer that the strength of the Lebanon was not inferior in the fourteenth century to what it had been between the seventh and tenth, when it resisted almost single handed the pristine vigour of the Caliphate. The most instructive portion of this incident still remains to be told. AVhen the Mirdites met the Mussulman troops of Damascus at Rabbellias, they were themselves commanded by two Mussulmans, the Emirs Fakreddeen, and Shemsheddeen. If, during the Crusades, the Mirdites were not at war with the Mussulmans, it follows that they were not at war with the Christians. Though mentioned by the Christian writers, and especially by AVilliam of Tyre, as a powerful and warlike Christian nation, they are nowhere spoken of as allies of the Crusaders, nor are they spoken of as their enemies. f AVhat * This Turcoman tribe was someway connected with the Beni Assaph, but my notes on the subject are indistinct and illegible. f William of Tyre, writing in 1 1 1 1, says that Tancred appealed in vain to \" the Christians of the mountains.\""], [74, "60 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. is said of them is sufficiently erroneous to prove the absence of so much as intercourse, for they are called Monophysites, and their name of Maronite is explained as being derived from that heresy, which is exactly the reverse of the truth : they were not Monophysites, and the name of Maron was known onlv in opposition to that heresy. Upon this ima- ginary schism is based the fable of their apocryphal conversion to the Church of Rome. It is, however, not only possible, but even probable, that some por- tion of that population which had come to receive the name of Maronite had adopted the Monophysite heresy; and, being* expelled, sought to connect them- selves by a renunciation with the Franks, which would give colour to the story. Or the same thing may have happened with the Druzes, who at one time had a common name with the Monophysites \u2014 namely, Unitarians : a term originally designating*, not a disbelief in two of the persons of the Trinity, but a belief in the one nature of Christ. It now remains for us to discover why the Lebanon, at war with the Saracens from their first appearance in Syria down to the Crusades, should have put an end to that warfare, and assumed a position of in flexible neutrality, from the moment that a powerful enemy of their own creed appeared upon the scone. That cause is not difficult to find. It requires but to recall the circumstances \u2014 those circumstances which I have already narrated \u2014 at once to perceive it. It is the introduction of the Druze religion."], [75, "61 NEUTRALITY DURING THE CRUSADES. If my explanation of the otherwise inexplicable success of that monstrous and ridiculous infatuation be correct \u2014 namely, the loathing of the Mirdites for the Byzantine Empire, and their hatred against the Caliphate \u2014 it would follow that, upon the removal of these causes, the effect should cease. The causes were removed by the appearance of the Crusaders upon the stage. In the immediate danger, remoter fears and passions were forgotten. Conversion to Druzism immediately ceased ; proselytism by Druzes was immediately suspended. The object now was to set at rest the schism of the garrison for the defence of the fortress."], [76, "62 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. CHAPTER VIII. MUSSULMAN PRINCES INTRODUCED. The harmony of the garrison was not to be ob tained by renunciation. The Moarni could not say to the Durzi, \" renounce your new imposture ;\" nor the Durzi to the Moarni, \" give up your old belief.\" It was enough that the Druze should be satisfied to remain as he was, and that the Maronite should be content to remain as he was; that neither should incommode the other on the score of doctrine, and abstain from indulging in the luxuries of proselytism. This neutrality, however, could neither be expected nor trusted in, whilst the administrative superiority remained with one of the sects. As to the differences in regard to belief, the Druzes had all the advan tage, being engaged in a course of triumphant proselytism. But the Maronites still held in their hands the supreme administration ; and to establish the balance, equal sacrifices were required, were possible, were made. It was necessary that the Druzes should cease to proselytize ; it was possible for them to do so : they did so. It was necessary that the Christians should surrender the Princedom \u25a0 and, unless they had done so, the Druzes would not have ceased to proselytize : they did do so. But if"], [77, "MUSSULMAN PRINCES. 63 the Maronites resigned the Princedom, it was not that the Druzes should usurp it. The condition and seal of the union of the garrison was, that now and henceforth neither Druze nor Maronite should rule in the Lebanon. They had to call in a stranger, and to constitute that stranger Prince; and they did so. They called in an Arab of the house of Tenhouk, and made him Ruler over them. Never theless, the ancient rule against the admission of strangers was held, with the exception of the Prince, as strictly as ever. Thus fell the ancient, simple, and patriarchal constitution of a people dating back its line beyond all history and all tradition ; and that not by a revolution, but by a logical argument, in the view of averting- prospective danger. It was effected in the midst of internal schism and external convulsions, calculated to perplex the judgment of the wisest men, and to overthrow the prosperity of the most formid able state. The success it merited crowned the performance ; and at this interval of time, without a document, annotation, or trace of any description, not inferential, we can embody in thought, and place before us in imagination, the Council of Elders, examining their position, weighing the arguments on either side, settling the plans for the future, imposing self-sacrifices on the passions of the sec taries and the ambition of the Princes, and listening to the patriotic outpourings of zelots surrendering* their fervour, and Emirs deposing* on the altar of"], [78, "64 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. their country, their station and their power. That such scenes have not unfrequently occurred in the history of the human race, the written records of that history cannot always efface, and very often imply. But such occurrences belong not to the period during which history has become precise ; when within that period such things happen, history trembles to record them, lest itself should not be believed. If the circumstances, as I assume them to be, of the first election are questioned, at least no doubt can exist in reference to the introduction of the two princely houses which followed the Tenhouk. On both which occasions, the people supplied the lost line by the elevation, neither of a Druze nor a Maronite, but by the election of a foreigner and a Mussulman. The last of these occurred at an in terval of seven centuries ; and during the whole course of this time, the purpose of the selection was secured. No religious dissension arose; no spirit of proselytism re-awakened. The names of Druze and Maronite are utterly ignored ; the people are always designated by their districts, the Princes by their names. AVhen factions appear, in the early stage they bear names which descend from Pagan times, and which were, common throughout Syria (Yemine and Caisie). In times nearer to our own, they are replaced by Jumbellati and Yezbecki, de rived from a local feud, in which Druzes and Maro nites are indiscriminately arrayed on both sides."], [79, "MUSSULMAN PRINCES. 65 That to appertain to neither Druze nor Maronite, nor to the mountain itself, must have been the con dition of the possession of the supreme power at all times, I know from my own experience; for, even in private communication, sincerity and confidence are out of the question, except with a stranger. And if the stranger be himself not competent to hold intercourse with them directly, his interpreter must be neither Druze nor Maronite ; he must of neces sity be a stranger and of strangers \u2014 if possible, a Mussulman. By placing the chief authority in the hands of a Mussulman, they, during the Crusades, secured themselves both against the attacks of the Saracens and the solicitations of the Crusaders. Christian and Druze obeyed alike a Mussulman leader; avoided taking part in a Mussulman combination ; and op posed in common an invading Christian host. THE LINE OF TENHOUK. Abul Feda mentions the Tenhouk as a Christian branch of the tribe Elnaman Ben Menzir, who \"first inhabited the Christian principality of Hire, and built large churches in the country occupied by his tribe.\" Hire, now Meschid Ali, was the celebrated Christian kingdom of Chaldea, which the exploits of Antar have rendered classic ground. After the slaughter of Nocuan, king of Hire, by Parviz, son of Calzias, his brother or nephew fled first to Moarre, v"], [80, "66 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. and thence to the Lebanon : the family soon after wards appear as hereditary princes, settled at Abaye, overlooking the plain of Beyrouth, which was one of the successive capitals of the Lebanon. It was upon this prince, who combined a royal descent with personal destitution, that doubtless the election of the mountaineers had fallen. The family settled at Abaye were Mussulmans, but being originally Christians, it is to be inferred that, like Henry IV., they renounced their faith for a sceptre. This is further confirmed by two incidents. Amongst the Druze writing's there are letters addressed to the Tenhouk as Christians. And when the Mussul man branch of the Tenhouk was shortly afterwards cut off, and a new election made, it was not a Tenhouk that was raised to the princedom, but a stranger; the Tenhouk remaining* in the country, and standing pre-eminent as a Druze family. The princely branch of the Tenhouk came to their end, not by natural extinction or by internal con vulsion. At the close of the eleventh century, Daher, of the Metuali family still established at Baa] bee, was in possession of Beyrout. He lost it to the Crusaders; who, seeking to extend their conquests, and doubtless attributing the resistance they met with in the Lebanon to the presence of a Mussulman chief, conceived the plan of effecting by treachery what they could not by force. The Prince and his family were invited from the neighbouring Abaye to a grand feast at Beyrout. They accepted"], [81, "MUSSULMAN PRINCES. 07 the invitation, and the whole, while seated at the Christian table, were massacred. A child named Dgemaleddeen is mentioned as the sole survivor; which must mean the sole Mussulman survivor, as distinguished from the Tenhouk who had remained Christian and had become Druze. This act of treachery did not bear the fruits which the Christians expected from it. Their designs against the moun tain were in no ways advanced, and the mountaineers were only put to the trouble of a new election,\u2014 a child being unequal to the cares and toils of govern ment at such a moment. THE MAAN. The next election fell upon a race no less distin- guished and no less unfortunate, equally combining royal descent and personal destitution. The Emir Younis was first or second cousin, through a marriage of his father, to the slaughtered Tenhouk Prince. He traced through Ayoub, the founder of the Ayoubites, back to the Beni Rebbia. Saladin was a collateral of the same line. In consequence of a Desert feud, the Beni Rebbia had originally migrated into Mesopotamia, and had thence wandered under the Emir Rabin to the neighbourhood of Aleppo. His son, the Emir Maan, from whom the patronymic is derived, engaged in warfare with the Frank pos sessors of Antioch. He was celebrated as a warrior ; but fortune proving adverse, he had to fly, and retired F 2"], [82, "68 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. to the B'kkaa, whence, contracting a marriage with the Tenhouk, an asylum was offered to him at Baklin in the Shouf. His son Younis was there fore a most eligible candidate ready to their hands, being allied to the extinct family, and being more over a Mussulman by descent. His successors ruled the Lebanon uninterruptedly down to the year 1694 ; that is for above six centuries ; continuing* in fact in that country the royal line of the Ayoubites, which had already disappeared from the rest of Syria and Egypt. It was two of his descendants who commanded the Mirdites in the battle of Rab belias against the troops of the Sultan of Damascus in 1306. A member of the house of Shaab, named Emir Hyder, has in the beginning of this century com piled a history of his country from native sources. His account of the introduction of the Maan, differ ing in every point from that which I have given, will, however, be found on critical examination entirely to confirm it. At all events it is incumbent on me to reproduce the passage, adding thereto the comments which it siig-g-ests. After mentioning the wandering of the Maan and bringing them to the neighbourhood of Baal bec in the Bkkaa, he proceeds. \" Whilst there this tribe received orders from Noureddin to establish itself on the summit of the'' mountains which divided that valley from the sea coast, in the towns of which the Christians had established themselves *"], [83, "MUSSULMAN PRINCES. 69 and having so fortified itself, to harass them by continual incursions. The Emir Maan obeyed, abandoned the fertile Bkkaa, crossed into the Le banon, established himself in Shouf, then a desert country.. Nearer the shore there was the Mussul man tribe of Tenhouk charged by Noureddin with the defence of the mouths of the Damour ; its chiefs lived at Abaye, and rejoicing at the arrival of these new allies, sent them masons to build houses for them. The Emir Maan perceiving the inconve nience of tents in these lofty mountains, often covered with snow, accepted these offers, and caused his whole tribe to abandon the use of tents. This prac tice became general, and the fugitives from the neighbourhood of Antioch, and of the other coun tries occupied by the Franks, assembled in Shouf and covered it with villages.\" That a weak tribe already expelled by the Franks, was to new settle an important district as a barrier to them, is not more conceivable than that that dis trict should be deserted. Nor is it more unlikely that the Sultan of Damascus should have confided to them this charge, than that they, on his mere order, should have abandoned the fertile plains of the Bkkaa, had they been established there as a tribe, to commence a new manner of life, without grain, and by sacrificing their sole subsistence and wealth \u2014 cattle. The conversion of the Arab from the no made to the settled life does occur, but not in this fashion ; and there is no similar case in all their"], [84, "70 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. history. Besides if this Mussulman population was then introduced, it is very strange that no remnant of it should be left, and with these stone-masons, that no mosque has been erected, for at least its ruins would have stood as a record. Independently of all this, where were the hundred thousand war riors mentioned by William of Tyre ; namely, the forty thousand Maronites, and the sixty thousand Ismaelians, if the Lebanon were uninhabited? Geography, however, furnishes the most complete and simple refutation of this supposititious Mussul man colonization. The assumed colonists were Arabs ; their settlements must therefore have borne Arabic names ; the Arabic is now the common tongue, having been gradually introduced during the last eight centuries. The Shouf contains fifty places ; of these thirty are pure Syriac, three uncer tain, and seven only are Arabic.

THE SHAAB. The Shaab descend from the great family of the Koreish. They formed part of the first expedition against Damascus, A. h. 23, where they appeared as the Beni Makzoum of the Hedjaz under the Emir Marith and his son Malek, followers of Abu Obeidah. After the capture of Damascus the Caliph Omar confided to the Emir Malek the com mand of the Hauran, through which the communi cations had to be kept open with the Hedjaz. From Saba in that district the patronymic of Shaab was derived : there they pastured their flocks during five centuries and a half. On the rupture between Saladin and Noureddin Sultan of Aleppo, they were obliged to fly, and in 1205 (a. h. 568) they found refuge in the AVaddy el Teim, their family having in the previous century formed an alliance with the family of Maan of Abaye. The annalist Emir Hyder, in narrating the first appearance of his own family in the Lebanon, may be expected to indulge in even greater exaggeration than in speaking of the Maan. His account is as follows. \" The removal of the Beni Shaab to the neigh-"], [87, "MUSSULMAN PRINCES. 73 bourhood of the Lebanon was occasioned by their known partizanship with Saladin. The Emir held a council of the wise men of the tribe, and its una nimous decision was to remain neuter in the war be tween Noureddin and Saladin. This they could not do in the Hauran, and they determined to remove to the valley which separates the Lebanon from the Anti-Lebanon. \" Sultan Noureddin sent to offer them a refuge in the city of Damascus. They answered that they would remain neutral between the Mussul mans, but would be always ready to join them against the Christians ; that they could not accept his offer to dwell in the city of Damascus, for their manner of life was under the tent. \" The Franks (Crusaders) held Hashbaya, and had filled it with troops and implements of war. Alarmed at the appearance of this new enemy, and sending for aid to the garrison of Iskif, they marched against them, and rushed upon them from the mountains like clouds of locusts. The Shaab met their foes with equal valour and impetuosity, and their chief, the Emir Murked, being of a poetic turn encouraged his adherents by a distich. \" The battle field is the only repose for my hate. \" The sword is drawn for the brightness of the congregation of Islam.\" \" After the loss of five thousand men, the Franks withdrew into Hashbaya, which the Shaab besieged ; and notwithstanding the masses of rock, and the"], [88, "74 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. showers of arrows which the engines of the besieged cast upon them, after a few days stormed the place. Five hundred Crusaders were put to the sword ; the remainder of the population was reduced to slavery ; each Emir had for his share ten men and five women. The heads of the garrison were sent to Damascus, and Sultan Noureddin conferred on the Emir the government of the country which he had conquered.\" Had he spoken of the Bkkaa generally, and not specially of Waddy el Teim, we could not have critically denied the accuracy of the statement ; but the AVaddy Teim is limited alike in length and breadth. On the east rises the Gebel El Sheik, and on the west a long sharp ridge : the furthest extent to which this narrow slip can be drawn out is fifteen miles. Of these fifty or sixty square miles, a small portion only is fit for pasturage, and the mountains rise abruptly on all sides. Fortunately an Arab tribe requires for its cattle an amount of provender which makes the movements of large bodies a most difficult affair. The body of nomades assumed to have followed the standard of Emir Munked would have required the plain of Tiberias to the south, or that of the Bkkaa to the north for pasturage. This is to suppose that these regions had been overran and conquered ; if so that act would have been stated, and the historian would not have narrowed down to the paltry though beautiful valley of the Teim, the greatness and the prowess of his house. Hashbaya, as its remains attest, had been"], [89, "75 MUSSULMAN PRINCES. at some time in possession of the Crusaders. How they lost it, does not appear; it is not so much as mentioned in the works on the Crusades which I have had the opportunity of consulting. Emir Hyder states that at the same time Rashaya fell into the hands of the Shaab, which is confirmed by the exist ence to this day of the same family as ruling it \u2014 not as a tribe inhabiting it. It is remarkable that during 680 years this branch of the Shaab should have uninterruptedly governed the valley of Teim, amid all the ordinary mutations of life and fortune and the peculiar perils incidental to this land. AVith this permanency of the family is it not to be ex pected that the tribe itself, if there had ever been one, would have endured? If we put aside the story of the tribe, then the elevation of the Shaab family in the Anti-Lebanon is explained by the same state of things which raised the family of Maan in the Lebanon ; namely, a mixed Maronite and Druze population. The Emir Younis is represented as re joicing greatly at the arrival and triumph of the Beni Shaab, and as going to Hashbaya to congra tulate them ; the Emir Munked in turn visits Baklin, already become the seat of the Maan, and spends a month there; and the two families are allied by marriage.

The house of Shaab held patriarchal sway in the Hedjaz for three centuries before it entered Syria. It maintained a princely independence in the Hauran for five hundred and sixty years, before they were called by the failure of the Maan to the government of the Lebanon in 1694.

FROM THE CRUSADES TO THE RISE OF THE OTTOMAN POWER. Between the close of the Crusades, and the establishment of the Ottoman dominion there is an interval of 279 years, during which the Mirdites disappear from the history of the world, as if they had never been, or as if they had ceased to exist. Mention of them is made obscurely by Mussulman writers only at one period, 1388, when they are noticed in the same strain as on former occasions by Byzantine, Armenian, and Saracenic wrriters ; that is, merely to state that they had ceased to exist. The occasion of this notice is an incursion of the Turcomans in that year, when the exposed and already detached district of Kesroan was again desolated. The only notice of the invasion of the Moguls under Timour Bey is occasioned by the Emirs of Hashbaya taking refuge in Shouf, to return only after those hordes had retired. Jnto the Lebanon itself they never penetrated. During these eight ge nerations they continued to be ruled by the house of Maan, the Shaab equally ruling in the Anti-Leba non. Native annalists record events connected with these families and some convulsions ; none of which, however, affect the well being of the people, the order"], [92, "78 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. of government, or the state of possession of the dif ferent princedoms. Various disembarkations of the Franks are noticed ; but they neither obtain sup port from the people nor become occasions of distrust or quarrel with the Mussulmans. The Princes and the People alike abstain from all connection with ex ternal events ; and it would not be known that there was any but one religion, nor even what that reli gion was, but for the contemporary ecclesiastical writers. In approaching the period of the Ottoman supre macy, we come to the first conquest of this people : that is, it is not until the end of the seventeenth century that that fatal word can be here spoken of. So striking a circumstance in the history of man may well induce us to pause for a moment to contrast their circumstances with that of the re mainder of the inhabitants of the earth.

The other countries we have mentioned have been themselves conquerors in turn, and brought upon other nations the sufferings they had them selves endured. But Syria figures in history only as a victim. In recounting the incursions under which Syria has fallen, we, at the same time, recount the assaults which the Lebanon has resisted. This Lebanon is not a Caucasus, permanent because inaccessible ; nor a Himalaya, whose atmosphere girds it round with a wall, and whose structure makes it the fountain of human events. These fourteen invasions were not the struggle of campaigns, but the turmoil of centuries. The Lebanon we see to-day is peopled by the weakest, the silliest population of the globe. It could, therefore, only have held its own by a constitution of mind which profited by its physical configuration. It is the excellence of a civil society which excluded feuds, and not the impregnability of a mountain fastness which arrested armies, that enabled this one province to defy alike Timour and Pompey, Saladin and Alexander, Tancred and Solo mon, the C\u00e6sars and the Caliphs."], [94, "80 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON.

How the Lebanon remained to be conquered in the seventeenth century is stated by implication, when there is no statement made of division. There was no contest of succession, no conflict of classes, or of general and local administration ; no difference had arisen in reference to the methods of taxation or the control of expenditure ; no interference had taken place with free exchange. The words \" pau perism\" and \"monetary system\" had never been heard ; no schemes of wrong abroad had under mined liberties at home ; no secrecy had, in the garb of diplomacy, destroyed integrity and inde pendence.

The Lebanon has remained free also from this infliction, as is attested by the record of its introduction in the middle of the eighteenth century. G"], [96, "82 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON CHAPTER X. THE LEBANON INCORPORATED INTO THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE. Syria was conquered by Selim I. in 1517. The inhabitants of the Lebanon, according to their his torian, resisted the Ottoman arms. The resistance of course amounted to no more than Ave have seen on previous occasions. Nevertheless, the then Emir, Fakreddeen, visited the Sultan in his camp, \" charmed him by his eloquence, and was commissioned by him to regulate the affairs of the other Emirs of Syria, over whom he obtained precedence.\" He returned home in peace ; no change whatever was effected in the condition of the countiy. Emir Fakreddeen does not seem to have troubled the other Emirs by his interference, or to have enjoA'ed the honour of precedence over them. He was gathered to his fathers after a long reign, and his son Kerkmass reigned in his stead. Under this prince a novel feature is revealed in the character of the people, and one which determined their subsequent fate ; this was the pillage of a caravan in the neighbourhood of Acre. The Ottoman dominion had now been established for more than half a century, and during that period"], [97, "INCORPORATED INTO THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE. 83 Syria had known the strange vicissitude of repose. Up to this time the turbulence of the Mameluke Sultans of Egypt and of the semi-independent princi palities in the neighbourhood, had kept the vigilance of the mountaineers on the alert, and so sustained the internal adhesion and external watchfulness, which, for so many centuries, had never been suffered to slumber for an hour in the Lebanon. It must be observed, that there was no soldier class, and but a laxly constituted Government; so that their means of defence consisted in constant preparedness of mind. E;ich man was armed, and each household, with its terraced fields and orchards, was a fortress which the inmates were ready to defend at a mo ment's notice ; ready for that purpose to muster, and for that purpose alone ; and on such occasions turning out from the child of ten years old to the man of ninety. They lived in a state, of which the variations consisted in the change from active siege to permanent blockade. And this existence had been for them continuous for nearly three thousand years, by means of which they had remained at once the most warlike and the most peacable of men ; who never touched what did not belong to them, but whom no one could touch with impunity. The strain out of which this character sprung could not be relieved without corresponding* effects ; it is quite to be supposed that these military habits no longer needful for defence at home should dege nerate into lawlessness abroad. It is equally clear G 2"], [98, "84 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. that the development of such a spirit in the Leba non imposed upon any constituted Government the necessity of arresting- it. To coerce such a people might be difficult, to endure their excesses impossible. The Porte seems not to have considered the forces at the disposal of the neighbouring- Pashas sufficient and had recourse to Egypt. The thread of Egyptian history, so long interwoven with that of Syria, was now for the first time intertwined with that of the Lebanon. There was then too an Ibrahim Pasha in Egypt ; he inarched from the banks of the Nile and joined the chiefs of Kesroan, finding parti zans in the mountain, principally the family of Tenhouk. Emir Kerkmass found himself unable to resist, and fled without striking a blow. The supposed ringleaders were sent to Constantinople, a fine was imposed, and the Lebanon from that time was subjected to an annual tribute; the Emir henceforward to be responsible for its payment, and to receive annually his investiture from the neigh bouring1 Pasha. - The chiefs sent to Constantinople were then liberated, the Prince was i\"estored. With the changes above mentioned the affairs of the mountain resumed their ordinary course ; it entered not into the idea of the Porte to legislate or to or ganize, and therefore the speculations of European writers upon the conquest then effected are equally silly and superfluous. Nevertheless from that period commences a new and unfortunate order of thino-s. In 1004, the Emir Fakreddeen, the last of the"], [99, "INCORPORATED INTO THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE. 85 Maan, succeeded to his father. This is the man who, by his violences and his folly, having brought to the ground, not only his own ancient house, but the constitution of his country in Europe, has been held to be a hero and a martyr. Having ruminated schemesof ambition,he entered into plots and alliances far and near. These being betrayed to the Porte, the Pasha of Damascus was ordered to put him down. This was now an easy matter, and Fakreddeen fled before the aspect of the danger he had evoked. He retired to Italy, where his oriental splendour, his courteous demeanour, and the mystery which over hung the Prince of an unknown people and of un heard-of faith, gave celebrity to the Druzes, and political importance to the Lebanon. Meanwhile, the family of Maan was not disturbed in possession. The Emirship passed to Youness, brother of Fakreddeen. Here commences the per verse order which endured down to the time of the usurpation of Mehemet Ali of Egypt. Youness had been engaged in the plots of his brother. The Pasha of Acre, to whom had now been conceded the right of investiture, bethought himself of the profitable in vestments secured to him in the delinquencies of the Emirs ; to be effected by obtaining the pardon, or, rather, in blinding* the judgment of the Porte, and exacting a compensation from the delinquent. The investiture of Youness thus realized for him 300,000 piastres,\u2014 a sum which, taking the then value of the piastre, could not have fallen short of \u00a370,000."], [100, "86 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. The tribute paid by the Lebanon to the Porte was 160 purses, or less than \u00a320,000. Thus, by the mere screening of an offender, the Pasha of Acre realized a sum exceeding threefold the revenue derived by the Porte from the wdiole province. It may easily be imagined what results were to flow from the invention of this new source of corruption. The profits of the Pasha of Acre on this trans action did not end here. The Emir of the Waddy el Teim had been, no less than Youness, compro mised in the intrigues of Fakreddeen. He too had to be condoned, reinvested and ransomed ; and a further sum of \u00a330,000 entered the treasury of the Pasha. Who was ultimately to discharge these fines ? Not certainly the two Emirs. The people had previously regulated their own modest finances with a sparing* hand, and scrutinized each item of expenditure with a curious eye. They were all pro prietors, all soldiers, all public functionaries : they did their own work. They did it well for they did it cheaply : and discharged it less by mone}' or pro duce paid, than by labour contributed. Voluntary contributions to the Prince made up his revenues. This simple rule, which is no other than the con dition of freedom, had now to disappear and that of exaction and oppression to take its place. Vice is an expensive luxury \u2014 and when a people lets loose its passions it must pay the equivalent, not in taxes only but in liberty also. The two Emirs had tasted the forbidden fruit and"], [101, "INCORPORATED INTO THE OTTOMAN EMriRE. 87 liked it. They recommenced plotting. There were Pashas in other places besides Acre, and they thought that what the Pasha of Acre had found so profitable it was desirable to share. Damascus be sides was nearer to the Waddy Teim than Acre, and its Pasha in turn took the Lebanon in hand. In 1614 he visited Hasbaya with so larg-e a retinue that the Emir did not think it advisable to await to receive him, and thence took his wa}- to Deir el Cammar (circle of the Moon), to which place the Emirs had now transferred their seat from Baklim. The place was sacked, and the palace of the Maan destroyed. Independently of these contentions with the au thorities of the Porte and strifes between the various families of chiefs, the Lebanon was then a prey to those ancient factions, Caisie and Yemene, which have periodically ravaged Syria for a space of not less than two thousand years, and which to-day, ex tinct elsewhere, retain a traditional hold over the people of the Lebanon. To Fakreddeen the door of return was opened by these troubles. He reappeared in the Lebanon after an absence of five years, and was met and wel comed by the chiefs of the whole country, extending as far as Baalbec, and so resumed without contest his former authority. A dissension had manifested itself among the family of Shaab, Fakreddeen succeeded in adjusting it by dividing the Waddy Teim into two parts, giving"], [102, "88 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. Hasbaya to Ali Shaab, and the superior part, with Rashaya, to his younger brother. This division has lasted to this day. The two brothers from that time attached themselves to Fakreddeen. The next event in the life of Fakreddeen is the defeat and capture of the Pasha of Damascus, to whom he excused himself on his success, and set him at libert}\\ The result was his pardon and confirmation in his now extensive acquisitions. The Metuali of Baalbec had been the cause of the quarrel, and they became the sacrifice of the recon ciliation. This tribe, encircling the Lebanon, had been the principal obstacle to the progress of the Emir of the Druzes, but they were nevertheless, because of their faith and turbulent habits, no acceptable auxiliaries to the Porte. Fakreddeen, in close alliance with the Shaab of Waddy Teim, had now extended his power almost to the ancient limits of the Princes of Gebail; that is to say, from the mountains above Tripoli to Safed and all the ports along the coast. The harbours he had filled up to prevent the entrance of the Turkish galle3Ts : otherwise he protected commerce. He thus held a considerable portion of Syria, and hemmed in the Pashalic of Damascus on the west. But the same fate awaited Fakreddeen that has always, sooner or later, overtaken the revolted Satraps of the Porte. That Government, patient to expect and dexterous to seize the moment when prosperity has lulled watchfulness and developed"], [103, "INCORPORATED INTO THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE. 89 license, at last fixed the mode and moment when he should be enveloped in the toils. Simultaneously troops were dispatched from Constantinople, and a contingent mustered from the nei\u00b0-hbourino- Pashas and tribes. Fakreddeen at once withdrew from the sea ports and cities, and shut himself up in the fortress of Iskiff. Youness, his brother, remained at Deir el Cammar, but being summoned to Saida by the Pasha of Damascus, who had occupied that place, he did not think it prudent to disobe}-, and was decapitated. The fort in which the son of Fakreddeen had shut himself up was taken. The Pasha of Damascus marched to Deir el Cammar and conferred the government on Alemeddeen, who was connected by marriage with the ancient family of Tenhouk, which had preceded that of Maan in the emirship, and who had been despoiled by Fakreddeen of the provinces of Meten, Jurd and Garb. He then marched to invest Iskiff, whence by cutting off the supply of water he dislodged Fak reddeen, who took refuge in the rock fortress near Lezzin. On the place being mined he surrendered. He was sent with his three sons to Constantinople, and soon after pardoned. In the mean time his nephew, Emir Melkem, who alone of all the family had escaped, succeeded in bringing about a revolution at Deir el Cammar, and in expelling the Governor set up by the Pasha of Damascus. The Porte on this put Fakreddeen and his sons to death. The troops of Damascus again"], [104, "90 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. took the route of the Lebanon. The Shaab of Waddy Teim were expelled, and the country given to the sons of Alemeddeen (Tenhouk). A simple sheik was made Governor of Shouf; Kesroan was separated from it and placed under a chief of its own ; the Shaab escaped to the neighbourhood of Aleppo. Soon after, however, Achmet, son of Emir Melkem and grand-nephew of Fakreddeen, regained the government of Shouf, and the Shaab returned to Waddy el Teim. Achmet, a second time displaced by Alemeddeen, was a third time restored in 1698. He died at Deir el Cammar without leaving male issue. The Tenhouk had already dis appeared, Achmet having* cut off every remaining* member of that family. There still remained one single representative of the Maan, Emir Hassan, son of Fakreddeen. But the Porte had now re. solved on the final exclusion of that family. Such were the results, first of the lust of pillag*e and then of the desire of conquest."], [105, "91 THE SHAAB. CHAPTER XL FROM THE ACCESSION OF THE SHAAB TO EMIR BESHIR. Thus, after five centuries of peaceful and one century of agitated sway, the Maan at once de scended from their state and disappeared from amongst men ; the clouds of disgrace as well as of disaster closing* over their tomb. The Emirs, the Sheiks, and the people of Lebanon had proved alike their inability to defend and to govern themselves. Their wealth and weakness invited, whilst their lawlessness seemed to require, the extension over them of the general administration of the empire and the substitution of the authority of a Valy (Pasha) for their local usages. The Porte neverthe less adhered to its secular maxims and its public faith ; for, although we have no record of the trans action, on the imposition of tribute their ancient rights, liberties, and constitution had been guaran teed to them. It therefore left to them to fill up the void occasioned by the disappearance of the princely house, and accepted their choice, repugnant as that choice must have been. It has been already narrated how the Shaab had been established as subordinate Princes in the"], [106, "92 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. Waddy Teim, in the year 1205, from which time they had uninterruptedly and by succession held that post. They had, however, during the course of the unhappy century now at its close, undergone the same change as the supreme rulers of the Le banon ; they had been engaged in the plots, usur pations and treasons of Fakreddeen, as in those which had followed his deposition. It was upon a member of this family that the election of the peo ple now fell, and its acceptance by the Porte is a striking instance of that magnanimity which it has always, under similar circumstances, displayed.* I have given the account of the first introduction of the Shaab from the pen of their descendant ; I will now have recourse to him for that of their eleva tion. \" A council was convened of the Sheiks and no tables, that they might choose one to govern them, and their choice fell on Emir Beshir Shaab, of Hashbaya, who immediately came to Deir el Cam mar, and entered it together with the Mufti, the Cadi, and the chief of the notables of Sa'ida, whom the Pasha had sent to enregister and estimate the pro perty of the last of the Maan, which amounted to 150,000 piastres. The notables of Shouf wrote to Mustafa Pasha, praying him to grant the investi ture to Emir Beshir, and to surrender to him the * A recent instance presents itself in the case of Servia, when rather than interfere with a popular election, it prepared for war with Russia and Austria."], [107, "THE SHAAB. 93 inheritance of his predecessors, engaging to become responsible for his regular payment of the tribute and the arrears. The Pasha did as was requested, and communicated these events to the Porte.\" The words of history have a negative as well as a positive value. The flow of speech introduces the eloquence of silence. In this case the writer de scribes by this process the internal constitution of the country more explicitly than he could have done by any form of Avords. Whoever reads this passage Avith the eye of the mind will learn by its silence on the method of election, that up to this time the Lebanon remained in full possession of the elective faculties. It is remarkable that, while up to this period neither the words Druze nor Christian are used, in the contests, which from this period become inces sant, it is Druze chiefs who always appear dethron ing* and setting* up princes \u2014 princes not of their race or people \u2014 and no mention is made of the Christians. Emir Beshir, in taking possession of the inheri tance of the Maan, had to surrender his paternal possessions. From this time the administration of the Waddy el Teim, in the hands of another branch of the family, has remained distinct, except on one occasion, from that of the Lebanon. The authority of the new Emir extended over no more than the portion now included in the \" Druze Cai macanship\" and the Kesroan."], [108, "94 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. Two years, however, had scarcely elapsed when an occasion was offered to Emir Beshir for extend in o- the power of the Prince of the Druzes over the original seat of the Princes of the Mirdites. Syria, after its conquest by Selim, had been divided into four Pashalics, Saida, Tripoli, Damascus and Aleppo. The Shouf was under Saida, and the limit between it and Tripoli fell on the coast north of Beyrout, at the river Adonis or Ibrahim. Gebail, Patroun, the Katan, and the other Maronite districts Avhich extend as far as the Akkar on the north, thus be longed to Tripoli. This division did not for the moment affect the administration of the Lebanon, reduced as its limits then were, and seemed to present an insuperable barrier to their re-extension ; especially as a stranger population appeared to occupy that portion of the Lebanon now included in the Pashalic of Tripoli. It is of this population that we have now particularly to speak. It has already been mentioned that the principal ob stacle to the projects of Fakreddeen Avas the strength and hostility of the Metuali race, which lay both north and south of the Lebanon. Also that the Porte looked with little favour on the auxiliaries which it had found in this population. Whence it came, how it came, what its race, what its characters, and whence its name, have been matters of as much doubt and mystery as the Druzes themselves. To all inquiries respecting them, even on their imme-"], [109, "EMIR BESniR. 95 diate borders, the only answers to be obtained were fables, revealing utter ignorance mixed with fear and hatred. This is certain, that they do not belong* to the original people of the Lebanon, and that their introduction dates but from a recent period ; certainly not before the fourteenth century, and more probably, or at all events principally, in the middle of the seventeenth. In their character, Avhich combines dignity of manners, and pride of descent with ferocity and laAvlessness of disposition, may be traced a derivation from a noble stock, and a succession of many generations of struggle, misery, and persecution. Historical circumstances justify by probabilities the inference, and suggest the pro cess. In religion they are Shiites, in race Arabs. To this anomaly, which alone Avould render them unclassible, must be added another ; that they have ceased to be nornades, Avithout passing* either into the condition of citizens or of mere cultivators, but hold the districts they inhabit as a feudally domi nant class. They have lost the tribe character of a people ; they have been prevented by their religious schism from being included in the administrative order of the Empire. Their position in the Lebanon was neither that of Princes called in to govern, as had been that of the Tenhouk, the Maan and the Shaabs, nor as that of a tribe which had displaced the original population and occupied the soil. The folloAving explanation is, therefore, the only one which I find for that peculiar nature which they"], [110, "96 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. exhibit, and the peculiar station which they hold. They are remnants of the Alides, driven from dis- tricts bordering on Persia ; hated by the Per- sians as Arabs, and by the Turks and Arabs as Shiites, reaching* successively the Lebanon as receiving shelter rather than as making* conquests, because of the community in Avhich they stood Avith both Druze and Maronite, in regard to the dominant races of the cities of the plains. Bearing their share in the contest of the times, the chiefs being Avarlike and their people united, they would naturally come to acquire that ascen- dancy in the districts they inhabited which would put them in a parallel position to that which the Druze Sheiks had acquired in the southern por- tion, over a population Avhich was Maronite. The Metuali, at the present moment in Beled Bsharre, and exclusive of those of Baalbec and the Bkkaa, do not exceed 60,000. A township of 60,000 souls would have indeed little weight in England ; but not so amongst such a population as I have been describing. At that time their numbers Avere larger. Then, also, the tract of country occupied in fief by the Metuali far exceeded the possessions of the Emir Beshir ; namely, the portion of the ancient Lebanon north of the river Ibrahim, amounting to one half of the whole; the Beled Bsharre, lying south of the Lebanon ; whilst their principal seat, where they had been established from an early date, Avas"], [111, "EMIR BESHIR. 97 Baalbec ; which exposed position, between the Leba non and the Anti-Lebanon, they had been strong* enough to maintain under all vicissitudes. Having* of their OAvn impulse opposed the ambition of the Druze leaders, having so essentially contributed by their sacrifices and efforts to the discomfiture of those Princes, having given to the Porte its triumph, and having occasioned the extinction of the House of Maan, the results which followed, namely, the libert}- given to the people of the Lebanon to re constitute themselves according to their own liking, could not fail to exasperate them. They had, more over, to encourage them, the consciousness of their own strength and the evidence of the impunity that attended rebellion in the events of Deir El Cammar. The consequence was, that the Metuali chiefs, subject to Tripoli, refused to pay their tribute, and, in like manner, tribute was refused by the Metuali chiefs subject to Saida. It was in the Tripoli Pashalic that the insurrec tion first broke out ; each party soon feeling that he could more injure his rival than benefit himself, by common consent the Druze Emir Avas called in to adjust the difference. This was effected by the errant by the Pasha of the investitures to him, and the re-grant by him of the investitures to the Metuali chiefs. Considering that the mass of inhabi tants Avere not Metuali, but Maronites or Druzes, this Avas the re-incorporation into the Lebanon of the district Avhich had been included in the Pa- li"], [112, "98 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. shalic of Tripoli : for the Emir Avas now placed, in reference to those districts, in exactly the same position in which he already was, in reference to the Lebanon proper under the Pashalic of Saida, Avhere he re-invested the Druze Sheiks over a population nearly equally composed of Druzes and Maronites. In the Beled Bsharre, similar circumstances were folloAved by the repetition of the same expedient, only that here investitures were not granted ; but the Ernir Beshir engaging for the pa}'ment of the tribute, became virtually the governor of the coun try ; so throughout its Avhole extent, from Tripoli to Safed, the Lebanon became subject to his juris diction, in 1702. After a comparatively tranquil reign of nine years, Emir Beshir was poisoned by Emir H}dar, who succeeded him ; but he was stripped of the acces sions of Metuali territory on the north and south. It was on this occasion that the government of Safed Avas conferred on Daher, the hero of Volney. Soon after the Pasha of Saida had reason to have again recourse to the Emir of the Druzes. The Metuali again refusing their tribute, the}* were again subjected to the government of Shouts and Emir Hy dar received the investiture of Beled Bsharre on the condition of acquiring it. He Avas successful in setting up as his delegate a Mussulman, named Mohamed Abou Kormanche. Proving not more punctual, the Emir attempted to remove him ; but so well had he taken his measures with the Pasha"], [113, "EMIR HYDAR. 99 of Saida, that instead of regaining the Beled Bsharre he lost the Lebanon. Abou Kormanche, with a firman of investiture from the Porte for the Beled Bsharre, supported by the Metuali, nothing loath to settle old scores with the Druzes, and aided by the troops of Saida, and by partizans among the discontented Druzes, succeeded in overthrowing* Emir Hydar : and established himself at Deir el Cammar, as Mahmoud Pasha. The Emir fled to Kesroan, but finding no support, concealed himself in grottoes and among rocks for a year, Avhen he was able to reappear again at Deir el Cammar. Mahmoud Pasha was upset ; and it being* against the custom to put the Sheiks of Shouf* to death, he had his tongue cut out. The Pasha of Saida confirmed the ehang*e, and re-invested Emir Hydar, doubling*, on the fall of Mahmoud Pasha, the sum he had real ized on his elevation. Emir Hydar, to recompense the adherents by Avhose aid he had succeeded in expelling* his dan gerous rival, and to strengthen and combine the Sheik interest, in opposition to an innovation so alarming to all the classes holding station or power as the introduction of a Pasha, distributed among the Druze chiefs the district of which the Shaab had become possessed by the extinction of the two ancient and powerful families of Tenhouk and Ale meddeen.

The wisdom of the scheme under the circumstances cannot be de nied, and receives a striking illustration in the con sequences which attended the contrary operation, when put in practice Avith such apparent success by his great grand-nephew the late Emir Beshir. But had the people preserved their ancient character, the Shaab Prince might have assured the foundation of his family on materials little resembling* that oligarchy, destitute of character and faith, tainted Avith meanness, soiled by crimes, and distinguished only by recklessness and cunning \u2014 which constitutes the class of Lebanon Sheiks from the middle of the seventeenth century. The districts acquired and now renounced by the Shaab were the Jurd, Jezzin and Menassif, in which was situated the capital. The higher Garb was conferred on the Talhouk to balance the lower Garb, in possession of the Rosselan,* which Avas the only house of Sheiks in possession who had favoured the introduction of a Pasha. Emir Hydar by these concessions aroused against himself the hatred of his own family. From one dangerous rival, in the person of his brother's son, he relieved himself by poison : another escaped the same fate by flight ; and finally he had to resign the power he had regained in favour of his son Malkem. These circumstances had rendered it impossible for * The present Caimacan of the Druzes is the representative of this house."], [115, "101 EMIR MALKEM. him to acquit his obligations to the Pasha of Saida, and at his death one of his sons and several sons of the Sheiks Avere at Saida, pledges for the payment of arrears. Emir Malkem received in 1730 the investiture of Shouf: two years after that of the Beled Bsharre, and subjected to tribute, as his predecessors had twice already clone, that turbulent people. Some excesses of the Druzes in the Bkkaa led to a rupture with the Pasha of Damascus, Avho sent an expedition against him. The Emir redeemed himself with 50,000 piastres. The Pasha of Damascus, to detach so valuable a dependant from the Pasha of Saida, conferred on him the government of Baalbec, the patrimony of the Metuali Sheiks. This operation was easier to plan than to execute, and the result Avas an open rupture between the Emir and his Avould-be patron. A defeat incurred by the troops of Damascus startled the indifference of the Porte, and stringent orders were dispatched to both Pashas to unite their forces against him. He was however saved by the opportune occurrence of a revolt at Damascus. In 1750 he acquired possession of Beyrout by an arrano'ement Avith the Pasha of Saida, Avhich place remained 25 years under the Emirs. In 1752 he had another quarrel Avith the Pasha of Damascus, but was sustained by the Pasha of Saida, on payment of 75,000 piastres. In 1754 the Sheiks set up against him his two brothers ; he fled to"], [116, "102 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. Beyrout. Thence he dispatched his nepheAv Cassem to the former Pasha of Saida, who had now become Grand Vizir, to solicit his own restoration and the investiture of Gebail for Cassem ; further requesting that their provinces should be given to them and to their heirs in perpetuity. The Grand Vizir listened favourably to these proposals, but Avas too soon re moved to take any step in consequence. Emir Mal kem died at Beyrout in 1 700. Emir Hydar sums up his sanguinary life in these words, \" he killed a great many of the inhabitants of his province and of the neighbouring ones, and many villages were destro}-ed by the wars he carried on.\" Mansour and Achmet, the brothers of Malkem, conceived themselves by his death relieved from the precariousness of their tenure. But the Grand Vizir, the friend of Malkem, had returned to power ; and remembering Cassem, expedited a firman for his installation in the government of Shouf. The Pasha of Saida prepared to support his pretensions, and had already furnished him Avith troops, Avhen the two uncles addressed themselves to the Pasha, and by the payment of 50,000 piastres induced him to abandon the cause of Cassem, who thereupon pro posed an accommodation ; resigning his pretensions to the Shouf, he Avas made Governor of Gazir and received in marriage a daughter of Achmet ; the fruit of this marriage was the celebrated Emir Beshir. The brothers no sooner got rid of their nephew"], [117, "EMIR JUSUFF. 103 than they armed against each other ; Achmet Avas established at Deir el Cammar, Mansour at Beyrout. Their respective quarrels Avere espoused by the two factions into which the Druze Sheiks were then divided, in consequence of a blood feud between two families, and Avhich were known by their names, the Yezbecki and the Jumbellati. The latter favoured Mansour, as also the Pasha of Saida, and b}- his aid he Avas able to march to Deir el Cammar, from AAhich Achmet, abandoned by his partizans, hastened to escape. No sooner was he freed from this rival, than another appeared, by whom he Avas finally to be overthrown, thoug-h only after a prolong-ad strug gle not of arms but artifice. Emir Malkem had left a son named Jusuff, Avho had been received by the Pasha of Damascus, from Avhopi he had requested the investiture of Gabail ; as this province was under the Pasha of Tripoli, who was son to the Pasha of Damascus, the request Avas readily granted ; and Jusuff was put in possession by troops from Tripoli, aided by the Christian population who rose upon the Metuali Sheiks. From that time the Emir Jusuff had his partizans, and openly aspired to the Princedom, Avhilst Emir Achmet, daily surrounded with intrigues and insurrections, found himself at last unable to carry on the government and surrendered his office to Jusuft' in 1771. He had entertained a moment of hope from the march of Ali Be}' and his Mamelukes iuto Syria, and had"], [118, "104 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. hastened to invite them to the Lebanon ; the failure of this expedition left him without any chance of escape or means of defence. Emir Jusuff hoav added the government of Gebail to that of Shouf and of Beyrout ; if his power was thus increased, so also was that of the enemy against whom it was soon to be employed. Already three pivots of quasi independent action were placed around the Lebanon, in the Pashalics of Saida, Damascus and Tripoli. A new one Avas to be added in the rise of the power of Sheik Daher, aided by the Metuali ; and a Pasha of a different temper was about to appear upon the scene, calling in the authority of the Porte in a manner not hitherto exerted in Syria. The affairs and personages of the Lebanon now emerged from the insignificance in which they had hitherto been shrouded, thanks to the pen of Volney and the fleets of Catherine. The Sheik Daher had his seat at Safed, formerly a possession of the Druzes ; his poAver could extend northwards only at their expense ; the Metuali were their enemies and on that account his friends : between him and Jusuff there could only be Avar or truce, and he had already taken the aggressive, wh^en the Emir received orders from the Porte to act in concert with the neighbouring1 Pasha ao-ainst O D f*} the rebellious Sheik. The Emir led an army against him and laid siege to Safed. Sheik Daher had appealed to the Empress Catherine, and she, eagerly seizing upon the favourable occasion of this"], [119, "EMIR JUSUFF. 105 diversion, placed the Russian fleet at his disposal. Emir Jusuff was vulnerable by such an arm only in his port of Beyrout, which Avas consequently taken by the Russian Admiral ; but after a few days re stored, on the payment of a sum of money, and placed in the hands of Achmet Be}-. This Achmet Bey was afterwards Jezzar Pasha (i. e. Butcher Pasha). The Emir, Avho had been called to Gebail by an attack or insurrection of the Metuali, on his return found the gates of Beyrout shut against him. Such was the first act in the long tragedy of the life of the future Pasha of Acre. In the mean time, the Avheel had gone round, the Sheik had found favour at the Porte, or from his Russian connection inspired alarms ; and Jusuff obtained his aid in expelling* his oavii servant from the city Avhich he had lost in opposing him. The Sheik Daher now became Pasha of Saida, and Jusuff Avas his dependant. Three years of repose Avere left to him, and then the Porte resumed its plans of vengeance, to accomplish Avhich, as formerly in the case of the Lebanon, the forces of Egypt Avere called to her aid. This interval was, as regards the Emir, filled up with a quarrel with the Pasha of Damascus, arising out of encroachments on the Bkkaa, during which Jusuff obtained the government of it for a feAv months. He afterAvard Avas involved in the schemes of Daher, and only by paying a large sum of"], [120, "106 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. money, succeeded in comprising matters with the admiral Hassan Pasha. The successor of Daher as Pasha of Saida Avas no other than Achmet, the faithless lieutenant of the Emir Jusuff, Avho, thrown into consternation at the news of this appointment, obtained from Hassan Pasha the emancipation of Shouf from all depend ance on the Pasha of Saida, except for the payment of the tribute. He also confirmed the Emir in the possession of Shouf, Gebail, the Bkkaa, and Bey rout. No sooner had Hassan Pasha and his fleet disappeared from the coast than Achmet Pasha (Jezzar) took possession of Beyrout, and demanded from the Emir three years of arrears, which had already been accounted for and settled with Hassan Pasha. The Emir despatched messengers in pursuit of the Admiral. They found him in Cyprus. He returned, reinstated the Emir in possession of Bey rout, and sailed forthwith : immediately Jezzar re occupied Beyrout, Avhich returned no more under the dominion of the chiefs of the mountain. The next event \u2014 and these folloAv each other with such rapidity, and are so complicated in their threads and tortuous in their course, that it requires no slight strain upon the attention to follow them\u2014 is at an interval of eighteen months.

Jusuff gets possession of Gebail and the Bkkaa; his rivals drive him from the Bkkaa, and besiege him in Gebail ; he makes his escape back into Shouf. There he enters into a composition Avith Jezzar for 100,000 piastres ; his brothers, obtaining intelligence of the transaction, submit. This struggle is folloAved by numerous confiscations in the Bkkaa, Gebail, and Shouf. Two years after, the brothers, supported by the party Jumbellat, again revolted. Jusuff, having* got pos session of one of them, Emir Effendi, stabbed him Avith his own hand, and a new revolt bursting* out, he put it doAvn by the aid of the troops of Jezzar. This success cost him 300,000 piastres, which he managed to pay by confiscations and extortions. In 1784, Jezzar ordered Emir Jusuff to take possession of the Merj Ajoun, which Emir Ismael of Hashbaya held in fief. Ismael repaired to Deir el Cammar to implore Emir Jusuff to intercede for him with the Pasha, and on his refusal he went himself to Jezzar, who not only granted his request, but conferred on him the government of Shouf, on his paying 300,000 piastres. Ismael immediately called to his aid Emir Achmet, brother of Jusuff, and who had already revolted and made his escape, when Emir Effendi fell by his brother's hand. Aided by the troops of the Pasha, they reached Deir el Cammar, and Jusuff\" took to flight. The"], [122, "108 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. new princes, hoAvever, being powerless to raise the taxes, the Pasha made overtures to Emir Jusuff, who hastened to meet him at Beyrout; but in stead of sending him to the mountain, he took him with him to Acre, on which the two Emirs regained heart, and sent to offer Jezzar 500,000 piastres for his head. He bid 1,000,000 for theirs. Jezzar immediately closed with him ; and Jusuff sallied forth with the troops of Acre, and drove Ismael, not only from Shouf, but also from the Merj Ajoun and the Waddy Teim. The ordinary confiscations and executions folloAv ; heads fall, tongues are cut out, and e}-es seared. Ismael, some time afterwards being taken, was poisoned, and Emir Achmet, treacherously delivered into his hands, had his eyes put out. Some years after (1788), Emir Jusuff\" inveigled the brother of Emir Ismael from Waddy el Teim to Deir el Cammar, by a promise of pardon, and had him strangled. The confiscations of his enemies' property, and the exactions to which he had recourse against the people, did not enable Emir Jusuff to discharge his debt to the Pasha Avithin three years. There re mained, in 1789, 150,000 piastres still due, and Jez zar, dissatisfied at such remissness, withdrew from him the Merj Ajoun and Waddy el Teim. Jezzar had been three years before invested with the Pa shalics of Damascus and Tripoli, in which he had placed two Mamelukes as his Lieutenants. These having entered into a conspiracy against him, the"], [123, "EMIR JUSUFF. 109 Emir Jusuff joined them. Jezzar, having triumphed, turned his fur}- against the treacherous Jusuff; concentrating his forces round the mountains, the latter was abandoned by his adherents, and the Yezbecki faction, who had hitherto supported him, and rancorously pursued by the Jumbellati. He consequently effected his escape, leaving the field open to his nepheAV, Emir Beshir, who Avas in the ranks of Jezzar, and is supposed to have had no inconsiderable share in the fall of his uncle ; lulling him into false security, and pretending* to betray into his hands the troops he had obtained to secure him.

We have noAV arrived at the accession of a Prince who has played a great part, not merely in the affairs of his country but in those of the Avorld.

But in reality the influence which he exercised was a de solating* one for the Lebanon. He ended by extin guishing the family of the Shaab, and at the same time extinguishing the Lebanon.

The narrative of events during that melancholy period which commenced with the accession of Emir Kerkmass, and which has gone on deepening in gloom and atrocity down to the close of the career of Emir Jusuff, present the Lebanon on the accession of Emir Beshir as a sink of unheard-of villany, a spectacle of unparalleled misery, a blot upon the page of history, and a libel on the very nature of man. It may well be matter of surprise hoAV the coun try, exposed to such vicissitudes and inhabited by a people so faithless and bloodthirsty, should not have been entirely depopulated, and how it should, on the contrary, present the dense population and the industrious culture Avhich continue to distinguish and embellish its rocky face even to this day. But in truth the people remained comparatively a stranger to these changes. The Princes generally fled Avithout a struggle, and hostile bodies Avhen in presence Avatched each other, man\u0153uvred from ter race to terrace, till the one having got a position of advantage or received a reinforcement, the other o-ave Avay. The blood that then flowed and the con fiscations that ensued fell upon the partizans of the defeated party ; the people noted the change only by the exactions to which the}' were subjected. These were indeed severe, but their effects Avere i"], [128, "114 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. easily reparable. The Lebanon as yet suffered only from the transitory violences of men, not from the undying perversion of legislators. Produce might be destrained when in the store, Avealth extracted from the chest, but debt did not overlie future indus tiy, nor fiscal regulations compress the energies of man. It was robbery only they were exposed to ; they did not as yet knoAV a tariff. The position of the Christians Avas greatly improved during* the administration of Jusuff. The aristo cracy, the instruments and victims of these unceasing troubles, have hitherto been entirely Druze. The Christians were comparatively unconcerned. Em ployed as agents and farmers they increased in wealth and consideration; and in the misfortunes and confications of their masters, ended by possess ing the lands they had cultivated for them. In the Kesroan, Christians gradually assumed the station of Sheiks. Proselytism not being admitted b}- the Druzes, every religious change Avas in favour of the Christians, and the family of Emir Hydar had openly adopted the Christian faith. Another change was the expulsion of the Metu ali, who held the Christians of the north in subjec tion; they, having aided in establishing in that region the authority of the Emir, became associated with his power, and consequently the objects of his protection. Besides, during the greater portion of the rule of Jusuff; his affairs had been managed by a Maronite priest of great dexterity; who, with op-"], [129, "ADMINISTRATION OF EMIR BESHIR. 115 portunities of no ordinary kind for promoting his designs, incessantly laboured for the advancement of his co-religionaries. The promise which the character of the young prince held out, the union manifested among the factions, Avere of equally short duration. No sooner did the new Emir commence taking* measures for discharging to Jezzar the price of his uncle's head, than all was confusion ; the Mountain rose against him ; his partizans, excepting- the Jumbellat, aban doned him. He Avas unable to make so much as a stand, and fled to Saida. Jezzar sent him back to push his fortune at the head of 1200 men ; the chiefs of the insurrection, the brother and nephew of Emir Jusuff, Avere about to embark at Be}-rout, Avhen a success obtained by Sheik Beshir, who, though son of the Jumbellat chief, had joined the other party, reanimated the Druze chiefs and united the Jumbellat districts, Avhich alone had hitherto favoured Emir Beshir, Avith the rest of the Moun tain. The Pasha of Acre, disconcerted by this resistance, recalled his troops and sent Emir Beshir Avith a modest pension to await at Saida the turn of events. (1793.) After some months of anarchy, the Sheiks proposed to Jezzar to confer the investiture on the tAvo leaders of the revolt, the brother and nephew of Sheik Jusuff, Emirs Hydar and Cassim, offering to pay him thereupon 2,000,000 piastres (\u00a3110,000). The two chiefs Avere, however, unable to manage i2"], [130, "116 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. their people or to raise the money ; and such were the disorders within and the ravages committed by them around, that Jezzar bethought himself of a new expedient. The Lebanon, not producing more than three months of its consumption of grain, he proposed to starve them into submission by blockade. Another event came to shake the power of the Emirs; the defection of Sheik Beshir, who was afterwards to play so important a part. Conceiving that his claims and important services Avere over looked, and disappointed in the results of the change he had himself brought about by abandoning the party to Avhich his family was attached, he turned his eyes again to Emir Beshir, and concerted measures Avith him for his restoration. Things Avere not, however, ripe for such a revolution ; too many feared his vengeance, and a middle course was adopted by the Emirs themselves., Avho sent secretly to Jezzar to negociate for their own supercession by the sons of Emir Jusuff\", and succeeded, on the pay ment of 100,000 piastres. The sons of Jusuff were joined by the late Emirs, and their party had taken possession of their new offices to the apparent contentment of the people, Avhen unexpectedly Sheik Beshir, who had collected his adherents, fell upon them, killed several of their relations and burnt and ruined their houses. The indignation aroused by this treachery forced Sheik Beshir to fly to the Hauran, and his serai of Muchtara and the houses and- properties of his"], [131, "ADMINISTRATION OF EMIR BESHIR. 117 relatives Avere in turn delivered to pillage and the flames. Emir Beshir, as the source of these troubles, Avas removed by Jezzar from the neighbourhood of the Mountain and sent from Saida to Nazareth. He had however already profited by his time and occasions, and had regained many of the chiefs opposed to him ; notabty the Bellarmy and the Amad. Thus fortified, he went from Nazareth to meet Jezzar on his return from the Hadj (pilgrim- age), and it was settled between them that Sheik Beshir should be pardoned and Emir Beshir re invested; which consequently took place in 1794. The family of Jusuff fled before him ; Abou Niket, the 011I3- chief who espoused their cause, was made Mucataji of Meten, the only district which had afforded them a refuge. The transaction closed as usual Avith an adjustment of accounts; 50,000 piastres purchased the pardon of the chiefs and Meten paid the expenses of the Avar. The Mountain seemed noAV to have escaped from its trials, and it might haA'e been expected that Prince and people, instructed by past experience, would have desisted from strifes in Avhich all pos sessed the power of inflicting injury while none could expect to reap benefit. I say, it might have been expected, but not in the Lebanon, where that alone is counted gain which Avounds a foe. A i'ew weeks had scarcely elapsed from the fall of the sons of Jusuff and the elevation of Emir Beshir, Avhen the sons of Jusuff were again in"], [132, "118 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. power, and Emir Beshir and Sheik Beshir in irons in the dungeon of Jezzar. Then fly to the Hauran the Amad and the Jumbellat. Again Muchtara is in flames and the Shouf is made to endure the same devastation as that Avhich just before had over taken Meten. In a year the land Avas ripe again with a harvest of disorder. Emir Beshir and his brother are let loose from their prison, they receive conjointly the pelisses of investiture ; their children are retained as hostages, and they are sent to the mountain again to make their way ; which Avas not on this occasion so easy, or had not been so Avell prepared. The Bellarmy-, part of the Jumbellat, and the Abou Niket adhere to the party of the sons of Jusuff, avIio, unable to stand in Shouf, make good their ground in Gebail, Avhere they had property and partizans. The cause of their unexpected resistance is to be found in the jealousy of the Pasha of Tripoli, Avhose troops advanced to their support. This support however did not avail them long ; a dispersion ensued, and the Abou Niket repaired to Deir el Cammar and threw themselves on the mercy of the conqueror. The re-accession of Emir Beshir wasfolloAved and marked by an event Avhich might arrest attention by its atrocity in the history of any other people. This event Avas the massacre of the Abou Niket (1797). Emir Beshir had them informed, that his brother Emir Hassan Avas kindly disposed towards them,"], [133, "ADMINISTRATION OF EMIR BESHIR. 119 had interceded for them with him, and that he was disposed to admit them to favour on conditions, which he invited them to Ibtedeen* to settle. They came Avithout suspicion and were received by Emir Hassan, with whom the terms of their reconciliation were settled. In the mean time the doors of the palace Avere closed, the avenues secured and Emir Hassan withdrew. Sheik Beshir and the Sheiks of the Am ad entered the apartment, and causing the Abou Niket to go out one by one, stabbed them.

The A'illages, lands, houses, and moveables of the Abou Niket became the recompense of the Jumbellat and the Amad. These measures struck with terror the chiefs and people, and the authority of Emir Beshir seemed after these incessant oscillations to be firmly estab- * The palace of the Emir which stands on a hill overlooking Deir el Cammar."], [134, "120 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. lished; Avhen the Lebanon, in common Avith the Avhole of Syria, was throAvn into convulsion by the startling intelligence of the disembarkation of a poAverful French army at Alexandria, which, after brilliant and rapid victories over the Mamelukes, entered Syria and laid siege to Jezzar at Acre. Throughout Europe the displacement of the so cial basis in each country has to be traced back to a movement of France ; to the presence of her armies, not simply as armies conquering, but as having been the occasion of promulgating metaphorical expressions, Avhich were taken by the various people as grounds for subverting their institutions and their habits, and casting themselves upon a sea of idle speculation. In Europe, this point of departure, by those who cannot look into the diplomatically origi nating* causes, may be taken as accident. France AvasatAvar; France conquered ; France revolution ized herself; France revolutionized others. Not so in Egypt and in Syria. The disturbance of these countries sprung directly from England. Had India been under the rule of native chiefs; or had the dominion of the Avestern masters of India been held to be firm, no French guns Avould ever have been pointed against Acre. As the despoiling England of her Indian dominions must remain a primary object for any individual ambition developed on a large scale in Europe, as well as for any pre-eminent system of ambition which may be, or is, instituted here, the whole of the countries which intervene"], [135, "121 ADMINISTRATION OF EMIR BESHIR. between the Indus and the Mediterranean or Black Seas, are exposed alike to convulsion by violence and subversion by intrigue. Nor is, indeed, the limit of this influence restricted to these bounds. When Napoleon pointed to the then not accom plished subjugation and incorporation of Poland, as the first step of Russia toAvards the dominion of India, he indicated this process as acting upon the Poles. The self-same consideration bears on every other people ; on the Hung-arians and on the Af ghans ; on the Italians and on Circassia ; on the people of Spain as Avell as on the people of Ger many ; and on the United States as well as upon Engiand and France. There can be no security, no repose for Europe, save in as far as England's hold upon India is so firm that the project of shaking it cannot be entertained. And England's hold upon India cannot be secure until she takes the measures in Europe as Avell as in India, necessary for the counteracting of those undertaken to dispossess her. In reg*ard to the Lebanon her task would have been accomplished, had the purposes of the then Govern ment been respected by her subordinate commanders. What she had to do in every case Avas the same. Not to meddle ; and not to endure intermeddling. She did arrest in Egypt the designs of Napoleon on India ; and she did restore the Egypt she had conquered to the Porte, Avithout being then insane enough to meddle in its internal concerns. We Avill see how her servants acted in the Lebanon."], [136, "122 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. The Metuali, avIio had suffered severely from the Pasha, looked on the French as deliverers, and hastened to join their standard. But Emir Beshir, who depended entirely upon him, looked of course Avith terror on the French, and returned no answer to the invitations and appeals addressed to him in the name of Christianity and indepen dence. At this time the Emir had become a Christian, although he continued ostensibly the profession of Islam. But if the Emir turned a deaf ear to the soli citations of Buonaparte, he was equally insensible to those of Jezzar ; to the latter he alleged the dis turbed state of the mountain as putting* it out of his power to render him any aid. While the issue was uncertain, he sought to avoid compromising himself with either ; which was being guilty of treachery to his legitimate superior, to Avhose ven geance he became exposed on the retreat of the French army. From this danger he Avas rescued hy the timely presence of Sir Sidney Smith, Avho, paying a. visit to Deir el Cammar, was easily Avorked upon, and made himself the advocate of the Emir with Jezzar. Some time afterwards, the Emir, not satisfied with the state of the negociations, requested a meeting* with the English \" Admiral,\" whose squadron Avas anchored off Beyrout. The interview took place near Abaye, and the Emir succeeded so Avell in captivating the English Commodore, that he gave"], [137, "ADMINISTRATION OF EMIR BESHIR. 123 him a pledge that he would never suffer the govern ment of the Lebanon to be Avithdrawn from him. From the conduct observed by the English Go vernment in reference to Egypt, it is evident that Sir Sidney Smith could have acted upon no instruc tions, but must have acted contrary to his instruc tions, when he presumed to dictate in the affairs of Syria, and when he selected for the object of his patronage, a rebel tainted Avith every crime. Sir Sidney Smith Avas as good as his Avord, and Warmly, urged on Jezzar the cause of the Emir. Jezzar Avould listen to no terms, and would shoAV no mercy. Sir Sidney Smith left Acre furious, and declaring that the displacement of the Emir would he a casvs belli with Great Britain. No sooner had the English fleet left, than Jezzar announced his intention of setting* up again the sons of Jusuff. But the Grand Vizir, in command of the army engaged against the French, had entered Syria. To him the Emir addressed himself; his remonstrances Avere backed by a present of 100,000 piastres, and a large supply of provisions for his troops. By these means, and the influence of Sir Sidney Smith, he was received into favour, and had conferred upon him by the Sadrazem the govern ment of the Lebanon, Baalbec, the Bkkaa, Waddy el Teim, and the Beled Bsharre ; with the assurance that his authority should be placed on the footing of that formerly exerted by Fakreddeen. Jezzar answered the firman of the Vizir by the"], [138, "124 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. investiture of the sons of Jusuff, in favour of whom the Avhole of the Sheiks declared, with the exception of the Jumbellat. The Emir was about to fly to the Hauran, when his hopes and courage were re neAved by the following letter : \u2014 \" My Brother and well loved Friend, \" I have learnt all that Achmet Pasha el Jezzar has done against thee. I have learnt that he has driven thee from the Government conferred on thee by the Ottoman Porte, and that he has put in thy place the sons of Emir Jusuff. I immediately prepared to go to Gaza to see our brother, the Grand Vizir. I hope that thou wilt soon receive from me letters that will fill thee with joy. Do not believe, my brother and friend, that my letters have failed by any other cause save the numerous battles and great fatigues which I have had to undergo at Aboukir and Alex andria ; and all that on account of the failure of Jezzar to send me the ammunition and provisions he had engaged to famish : he has become my enemy, and the enemy of the Porte ; for by the treaties that unite us, the enemy and friend of the one becomes the enemy and friend of the other. My brother, be not troubled ; if God all powerful permits it, soon you will enjoy all you desire. I have left thee one of my vessels at Beyrout, which will aid thee in all thou mayest require. I know well that some of the evil disposed who are about thee will furnish to Jezzar a copy of this letter \u2014 but by the time he will see it\u2014 chastisement will have fallen on his head. \" I salute thee, \" Sidney Smith.\" \"The Damour, the 5th of Kanoun el Evel.\" (5th Dec. 1802.) Sir Sidney Smith certainly lived before his time : it was for this age he Avas fitted, and into it he ought to have been born. Shortly afterwards, the Emir, conducted by the"], [139, "ADMINISTRATION OF EMIR BESHIR. 125 English consul of Tripoli, embarked on board an English vessel of war, joined the Commodore, and was by him taken to the camp of the Grand Vizir, at El Arish. Tents were prepared for the Emir and the Commodore, and the latter introduced the former to the Grand Vizir in these terms : \" Whilst I was at the siege of Acre, I observed in this Emir great courage ; it is he who saved Syria from the French, and has preserved it to his Highness Sultan Selim ; his reputation has reached the ears of the Kino- of Great Britain.\" The Grand Vizir answered : \" Our friend has said what is true; this Emir is one of the first servants of the Porte, and I shall take means for his resto ration, so soon as the French are driven out of Egypt.\" Whilst the Emir was at El Arish, and cruising Avith the English squadron, Sheik Beshir Avas at work in the Lebanon. A revolt had broken out in Meten. The Emir Avas landed from an English vessel near Tripoli, and soon found adherents in the Kesroan. Among the first to join him were the two surviving* scions of the house of Abou Niket ! The sons of Jusuff, terrified at these events, had recourse to Jezzar, who sent them troops. The struggle that ensued was sanguinary beyond comparison, but futile in results. The Emirs in possession could not dislodge their rival ; nor he advance into their districts. So they Avere reduced to a compromise, which left the country without a government. The"], [140, "126 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. sons of Jusuff retired to Gebail; Emir Beshir settled in the Meten. This interregnum saw several pretenders arise. Three Shaabs received the investiture from Jezzar, without being able to exercise any authority. A series of movements of chiefs and sheiks from one side to the other ensued ; the enemy of to-day becoming the friend of to-morroAV. The partisans of the sons of Jusuff presently appear as those of Emir Beshir, and those of the latter become the allies of the former. At length a memorial, sig*ned by the great majority, was addressed to Jezzar, praying for the restoration of Emir Beshir.

ADMINISTRATION OF EMIR BESHIR TO THE DEATH OF SULEYMAN PASHA. The death of the fortunate and dexterous \"butcher\" threw Syria into disorder, and gave scope for a game of intrigue, in which Emir Beshir, without apparently playing a prominent part, suc ceeded as heretofore in securing the chief advan tages. Jezzar had had the Pashalics of Tripoli and Damascus united in his person with that of Acre. The two former posts he had filled Avith slaves of his own, Avho, as Ave have seen, conspired against him, and besieged him in Acre. Emir Beshir had entered into their views, and had since maintained a secret intelligence with Suleyman, Pasha of Damascus, Avho had managed to maintain himself to the time of the death of Jezzar. On that event one of his dependents, named Ismael, conceived the project of possessing himself of his inheritance ; and resolved to keep Acre for himself. The Porte, in anticipation of such an event, had, previously to the death of Jezzar, expedited a firman to Ibrahim Pasha, of Aleppo, putting him in possession of all the govern- ments held by Jezzar, to be used at his death. Suleyman Pasha had already declared against"], [142, "128 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. Ismael, and sought to secure himself at the Porte by enforcing* its authority against his former col league. Emir Beshir declared in his favour ; and Ismael, consequently, called to Acre from the Hauran, where they had taken refuge, two Shaab Emirs, who in the recent interregnum had been set up for a moment in the Shouf. The Pashas of Aleppo and Damascus now ad vanced against Ismael, and shut him up in Acre, before Avhich place they sat down. The}' summoned Emir Beshir Avith his contingent of troops ; but he, according to his custom, Avould not compromise him self against Ismael, Avho might in the end be suc cessful ; and though he repaired with some troops to Acre, he kept at a cautious distance ; and excused himself from paying his respects to the Vizir of Aleppo, by declaring that he had made a vow, after having been put in irons by Jezzar, never again to visit a Pasha of the Porte. The Pasha Avas pleased to accept the excuse, and ordered him to Djouni,* probably expecting thereby to keep him out of the way of mischief. The Porte, in the mean time, had despatched a commissioner, Ragheb Effendi, to Avatch the operations in Syria. Dissatisfied with Ibrahim Pasha he entered into relations with Emir Beshir, Avho, it is supposed, found thus the means of getting Suleyman Pasha, his old friend, substituted for Ibrahim Pasha as the new Governor of Acre. * The subsequent residence of Lady Hester Stanhope."], [143, "EMIR BESHIR. 129 Ragheb Effendi, after these interviews, left for Con stantinople, and soon returned with the firman of investiture for the Pasha and a Vizerial letter for Emir Beshir, recalling the promises made to him at El Arish, assuring* him that they would be kept so soon as circumstances permitted. On the fall of St. Jean d'Acre, Suleyman Pasha signalized his gratitude by restoring to Emir Be shir the bonds of the Emirs of the Shaab family, given to Jezzar,* either to purchase out rivals or to buy in themselves ; and Avhich amounted to the enormous sum of 18,000,000 piastres. The inves titure was accorded to him for the first time as \" Emir of the country of the Druzes.\" The Emir signalized this name by reducing to a condition Avhich released him from future inquietude, the Christian district of Meten, which, during* the last few 3'ears, had commenced to take part in the feuds of the Sheiks ; and where two Christian families had sprung up to a sort of equality Avith the Druze aris tocracy. These Avere named Hatoun and Hantar.

K"], [144, "130 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. recollecting the fate of the Abou Niket, after they had lent their hands to his purposes, despairing of safety, fled the country and took refuge in Egypt. Such Avere the benefits Avhich the Christians owed to the first Christian prince set over them. His principal source of alarm Avas now the sons of his uncle, Avho had so often already driven him from power ; and he determined to deal Avith them as with Abou Niket. It was true they Avere not within the limits of his government, and held Gebail under either the Pasha of Tripoli or of Damascus. The Emirs were not distinguished by any capacity, and the strength of their party resided in a Christian, George Baz, devoted to their interests, a man of remarkable daring, dexterity, and cunning. He had secured to himself partizans not only in Shouf but in Damascus and Acre, and resided, not Avith his pupils, but at Deir el Cammar, av hence he could more securely plot the overthroAv of the Emir. He had a brother, a man scarcely less able than him self, who remained with the Emirs at Gebail. The enterprise Avas therefore one Avhich presented no ordinary difficulty, as it was requisite to secure Baz and his brother as well a3 the sons of Jusuff. At that time the Talhouk and the Abdelmalek were in disgrace and expelled from their districts. The Emir sent for them and proposed to them, as the condition of their restoration, that they should re pair to Gazir to his brother Hassan, and engage to execute whatever orders they should receive from"], [145, "EMIR BESHIR. 131 him. They, fully understanding the nature of the service required, closed with these terms and pro ceeded to Gazir. Emir Hassan accompanied them to Gebail, Avhere, entering as travellers, they suddenly surrounded the house of the brother of Baz. He attempted to escape from a Avindow, but fell and broke his leg, and Avas instantly dispatched by the conspirators. Meantime Emir Hassan secured the two sons of Jusuff, with a younger brother, and, Avithout meeting any resistance, carried them off. The same da}-, at Deir el Cammar, Emir Beshir sent for George Baz ; received him with extraordi nary kindness, passed him over to Sheik Beshir, who, at the very hour that the Abdelmalek and the Talhouk were dispatching his brother at Gebail, strangled him and threw out his body into the streets for the dogs to feed on. On this the Emir, becom ing alarmed lest the plot at Gebail should have failed, took horse and proceeded thither. On the Avay he met the messenger bringing him the joyful in telligence of its entire success ; he therefore returned in peace, sending back by the messenger an order to put out the eyes of his cousins. They Avere placed under Avard and forbidden to marry ; their property was confiscated, and the investiture of Gebail Avas obtained, through the influence of Suleyman Pasha, for his son Cassim. In other countries tyrants have succeeded in eradicating families possessed of influence; but no where else has been seen an aristocracy lending its K 2"], [146, "132 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. own hand for the extirpation of its several members. Princes Avho have succeeded in such a policy have commenced by raising mercenary troops ; they have enrolled felons and emptied jails ; or they have used the animosities of other classes ; or called in strangers destitute of all -connection with their victims. On the rare occasions when such tragedies have dis graced human nature, the field has been Avide, the affairs complicated ; distance, doubt, suspense, have suffered dexterous guilt to Avalk securely, and attain its ends before its purpose Avas known or its approach apprehended. Here no mercenaries are required. The Mograbins of Jezzar are not called in ; no secret assassin engaged ; no poison mixed ; no mask held up. The case is common for all : yet all the parties involved might be gathered round one dinner table ; every individual is known to every other individual ; the scene on which are condensed all the crimes of the Eastern Empire under the Comneni and the Pal\u00e6ologi, is a morning's ride. The Emir has to deal neither with factions nor classes, but with a party of gamblers. They stretch out their hands to him for the dice and the cards, and his business is to cog the one, and to prick the other. The stakes for which they throw are the vines of a neighbour, not to enjoy, but to dig up ; his mulberries, to hack ; his terraces, to level ; his canals, to break down ; his house, to set fire to ; his eyes to put out, and his throat to strangle. If the Avork ceases for a time, suddenly it recurs without"], [147, "EMIR BESHIR. 133 apparent cause, as if springing from a periodical necessity, giving to the annals of their count ry a harmonious march of atrocity : no season lacking its expelled Prince, its stabbed rival, its ravaged district. Never does the drama derogate from its claims of style \u2014 passion and necessity \u2014 by the interference of mean and private ends, such as the setting up of one of themselves. The Emir must be a Shaab ; the Emir is to be cast down ; the Pretender is a Shaab. To that station, the Aveakest child bearing the name, is carried by the revulsion of faction or the caprice of passion ; and he puts to flight the Prince bearing- the same name, Avho may haA'e tAventy times triumphed Avith or over them. It was neither an effort of genius nor a stretch of imagination for Emir Beshir to say to himself, \" I will get rid of them all.\" (1808.) The blows which had been struck at the different families of Sheiks had each returned to the Emir a double profit ; the succession of him on whom it fell, the obloquy of him Avho levelled it. The continuance of the process and the envelop ment therein of every single family of notables, had placed the Sheiks in this position, that, through their mutual wrongs and suspicions, they were incapable of concert as a class for their own pro tection. They were destitute of support on the part of the people, to whom they Avere objects of abhorrence from their character, and of hatred from their acts. Thus it was that the Emir in the"], [148, "134 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. accomplishment of his great design made no ap peal for foreign aid, and had no recourse to secret means. The work had indeed, though partially, accomplished itself before the general design had to be considered. The Abou Niket were rooted out; the Amad had fled; and with the extinction of the house of Jusuff these two confisca tions might be considered as ensured. The plan of exterminating the Sheiks could not be devised as such until the Shaab family ceased to afford ready rivals, by the extinction of the elder branch (that of Jusuff) and by the disqualification of his own, the junior branch, through a cause which indeed was common to himself, but which he so managed as to render repressive against them ; namely, by their apostacy from the faith (that of Islam), to the pro fession of Avhich, the family OAved its elevation to the Emirship. The most remarkable feature in this operation is Sheik Beshir. He was a Druze Sheik, the head of the Jumbellat ; and at once incomparably the ablest and the wealthiest man in the country. It Avas his adherence to Emir Beshir that alone sustained the latter in the country ; and sustainino* him he managed him and used him for his oavii ends. He stood at the head of the Sheiks, and the destruction and extinction of the Sheiks was the aim and end of the administration of Emir Beshir. But Sheik Beshir was engaged in the operation by cir cumstances, and before the plan was conceived he"], [149, "EMIR BESHIR. 135 had dipped his hand successively in the blood of each victim. When the moment came for him to decide whether he should go on or draw back, it was too late to deliberate ; or he may have seen the future means of turning to his own profit the con templated operation. As a Sheik and as a Druze he could not aspire to the Emirship. But from the moment that the Emir himself had become Christian, that Emir continued to rule only on a false pretence. Sheik Beshir Avas in the confidence of the secret, and was careful to preserve it. The day might come Avhen Emir Beshir, by the destruction of the Sheiks having become sole master at home, would alarm the Porte by intrigues and enterprises abroad ; and what would then prevent Sheik Jumbellat, after denouncing the apostacy of his master, from pro fessing Islam, and finding himself Mussulman Emir of the Mountain ? At all events, it is impossible that Sheik Beshir should, after the extinction of the line of Jusuff, have engaged in the scheme of extinguishing* the Sheiks, if he had looked to no more than the accumulation of the profits in the hand of Emir Beshir. From this period for fifteen years domestic repose prevailed. This truce from family plots was owing, in a great measure, to the accession of his creature Suleyman Pasha to the Pashalic of Acre. The interval was used with remarkable caution ; the people Avere rendered familiar with his sons as Mucatajis in the room of those families that had"], [150, "136 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. been displaced. The intermediary organization Avas insensibly superseded by his own direct inter vention in all affairs; Avhile he amassed treasure, he loyally distributed justice. The Sheiks still undeposed Avere restrained within limits by his authority, and the cessation of the preA'ious inces sant feuds relieved them from the accompanying charges, exactions and alarms ; so that the country enjoyed prosperity, and magnified the Emir. (1810.) Suleyman as Pasha of Acre would have been unable, whatever his intentions or obligations, to have afforded tranquillity to the Lebanon, since the Pasha of Damascus had equally a power of disturbing it. But, two years after his nomina tion to Acre, he Avas aggrandised by having the Pashalic of Damascus also conferred upon him. An incursion of the Arabs, Avhich the former Pasha of Damascus had been unable to check, had alarmed the Porte for the eastern portions of the Empire, while it was Avithout forces to dispatch for its defence ; being at once at Avar with England and with Russia. The Avhole poAver of the latter Avas lying* on her northern frontier, and she was ex posed to attack from the former on every portion of her coast, from Dalmatia to Alexandria, where a landing* could be effected by troops. In this extremity the Porte turned its eyes on the Pasha of Acre as a fit person to secure Syria, and invested him with the Pashalic of Damascus, leaving it however to himself to supply the means"], [151, "EMIR BESHIR. 137 of putting its decree into execution. The war now declared between the Pashas of Acre and Damascus opened an immense field to Emir Beshir. To his sagacity no less than to his contingent of men and contributions in stores, was Suleyman in debted for success. They entered Damascus in triumph together. The Emir had for his share of the spoils the investiture of the Bkkaa (for his second son Halil) and the confirmation of the Lebanon for life. The condition however was appended, of a yearly investiture, and the faithful execution of his engage ments. In the eyes of the people, as in those of the Porte, he rose to a position of new and vast importance, and having so achieved power at home and fame abroad, he undertook useful AA'prks, built bridges over rivers, and reared in the palace of Ibtedeen a rival to the Alhambra. Warring chiefs from afar sought his arbitration, and \" never before had there been in the Mountain a prince so glorious and powerful.\""], [152, "138 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. CHAPTER XIV. THE CONNECTION OF EMIR BESHIR AVITH MEHEMET ALI. (1819.) On the death of Suleyman Pasha, Abdallah became Pasha of Acre and Tripoli. Then it ap peared that the blood he had shed, the influence he had acquired, the repose he had enjoyed, served nothing to the Emir, as soon as this prop was re moved. The catastrophes of the time of Jezzar reappear ; he is again and again driven forth Avith as much ease as ever, to return AA-ith the same facility. (1821.) A year from the death of Suleyman Pasha had not elapsed when a conspiracy was formed by the tAvo remaining members of the house of Niket and the Amad Avho had massacred the rest of them. They were joined by the Abdelmalek and the Telhouk, who had embrued their hands in the blood of the brothers Baz, and had blinded the sons of Jusuff. The Prince against whom they conspire Avas the accomplice of each in these crimes. The Amad were not in the Lebanon : but ha vine- re turned from Egypt had settled themselves at Damascus, whence this plot Avas conducted ; it was nowever discovered in time and disconcerted. The"], [153, "EMIR BESHIR AND MEHEMET ALI. 139 conspirators had to fly ; but pursued by the rancour of the Emir from place to place, they only found a refuge in the wastes of the Hauran. Their families were formally deposed from the government of the districts which Avere held to belong* to them, and in their persons the whole faction of the Yezbecki were smitten AA'ith confiscation. , Abdallah Pasha had taken no ostensible part in this transaction, but required on its conclusion, as the price of his neutrality, 1,000,000 piastres. The Emir resisted the demand. The Pasha block aded the Mountain. The Emir, reduced to neAV straits, submitted ; and attempted to make Meten the sacrifice, by imposing on it the required contri bution. But Meten demanded that the Druzes should pay their proportion. The Emir made con cessions which did not satisfy, and therefore en couraged them. The priests took part in the quarrel and the people fleAv to arms. For the first time a Christian, Ayan, appeared at the head of a move ment of the Sheiks of the Mountain. The expelled Sheiks quitted their retreat in the Hauran, and ap peared at Acre ; the movement of the Christians was combined with the Druze Sheiks and supported by Abdallah Pasha. Emir Beshir, losing heart, wrote to the Pasha that he would abandon the Mountain ; and, after in vain attempting to find a refuge among his relations, in the Waddy el Teim, followed the traces of the Abdelmalek and the Talhouk to the Hauran, and Avith his family, Sheik Beshir, and"], [154, "140 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. those attached to his fortunes, returned to the wan dering life Avhich his fathers had led in the same re gion eight hundred years before. The two pretenders, Emirs Hassan and Selman, who first appeared during the interregnum, were conjointly appointed, and the Yezbecki returned to power. The Greek revolution Avithdrew the Emir from the desert, and restored him again to power. Instruc tions had been sent to Abdallah Pasha to watch the Christians closely, and to fortify the cities of the coast. There being no other chief of capacity or authority sufficient to control under such circum stances the Mountain, he turned his eyes again on the Emir, and invited him to the neighbourhood of Acre. The Emirs in possession, hoAvever, obtained their re-investiture on engaging to pay 1,750,000 piastres ; but Emir Beshir Avas suffered to go Avith his partizans and settle in Jezzin, at that time sepa rated from the government of the Mountain. With such neighbours the government of the Emirs Has san and Selman became impossible. In daily fear of an invasion and in nightly dread of an insurrec tion, to raise the contribution required by the Pasha was out of the question. The Yezbecki hastened to make their peace Avith the Emir, and the Pasha did not long delay the pelisse of investiture. In the space of one year he had dispersed a conspiracy, fallen before an insurrection, seen himself replaced by two rivals, had raised an insurrection against his suc cessors, and found himself again seated in the"], [155, "EMIR BESHIR AND MEHEMET ALI. 141 corner of the Selamlik at Ibtedeen where I write these words. No sooner Avas he reinstated than the country Avas again in convulsion. The agents sent to collect the taxes Avere resisted by the Christians of Gebail and Kesroan. The Metuali joined the Christians ; the Emir hastened to the insurgent districts, accom panied only by a feAV troops, expecting* by his pre sence to restore order. He found 2000 men in arms to oppose him, Avho, from behind their Avails, during* several hours, allowed their bullets to drop all around the spot Avhere he Avas encamped. Neither conde scending* to reply nor to retreat, he remained so ex posed, and secured an additional reputation, that of cool resolution, which is perhaps the only pleasing remembrance Avhich has survived his fall. He main tained his ground until the arrival of the Sheiks of Shouf. Hassan and Selman, who, like corks in the water, are always ready to re- appear, attempted to intercept this succour, but were defeated. On this the insurgents submitted, and the contributions were raised to 600,000 piastres. Hostilities followed between the Pashas of Acre and Damascus. The Emir, liable to the attacks of both, received orders from each. He sided with Abdallah, against whom the Porte at last declared itself, ordering the Pasha of Aleppo to unite with the Pasha of Damascus to put him down. The refugees of the Mountain, especially the old Amad, met the Pasha of Aleppo on his Avay, and promised"], [156, "142 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. him the support of the Yezbecki if he granted the investiture to the Emirs Hassan and Selman, to which he assented. Afterwards, better informed as to the resources of that faction, he appointed ano ther Shaab, Emir Abbas. Emir Beshir sought refuge at Beyrout ; but the inhabitants, Avho had risen against Abdallah, refused to receive him. He then tried Saida, but it was occupied by the troops of the Pasha of Damascus. In this extremity he was relieved by the Pasha of Egypt, who offered him an asylum ; and, finding a vessel on the coast, he embarked for Alexandria Avith his family, was cordially received by the Pasha, with whom he spent eight months, and to whom he Avas afterwards indebted for his sixth elevation. This is the critical period in the history of the Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt. It Avas then that Mehemet Ali gained over Emir Beshir the ascendancy he never after wards lost : his future schemes were now revealed in the measures he took to place not only the Prince of the Druzes, but the Pasha of Acre in his inte rests ; Avhich were no other than to obtain from Constantinople the pardon of Abdallah Pasha, and then from him the restoration of Emir Beshir. All this was accomplished. The Emir engaging to furnish his contingent of the 12,500,000 piastres, the sum at which the Porte estimated the pardon granted to Abdallah. The Emir, restored by Mehemet Ali, was now utterly dependent on him, for a change had in the"], [157, "EMIR BESHIR AND MEHEMET ALI. 143 mean time occurred. Emir Abbas Avho had been substituted by the Pasha of Aleppo, for the Emirs Hassan and Selman, the bitter foes of Emir Beshir, had been designated indeed by the latter himself, who finding* his position untenable, wished to have for his successor a prince favourably disposed. Under these circumstances Sheik Beshir had remained in the Lebanon. The minister of Abbas was a Christian Sheik, named Merai Dadah. This man having estab lished an intimacy Avith Sheik Beshir, the latter, who was the right arm of Emir Beshir, declined to afford his usual aid ; nor Avere matters adjusted till 950,000 piastres had changed hands in purchase of for getfulness of the past, of which four-fifths ulti mately found their way into the coffers of Abd allah. Shortly after this apparent reconciliation, Sheik Beshir, whether seized by a panic, or acting on in formation, fled to the Waddy el Teim, thence he communicated with Emir Abbas, offering to obtain for him the government of Gebail from the Pasha of Damascus. The Emir yielded to his representa tions ; and the Pasha of Damascus was only pre vented from granting the investiture by the objec tions of Abdallah Pasha, Avho, however, engaged for their personal safety if they Avent back, and dis patched orders accordingly to Emir Beshir. The stage-like shiftings which ensue may be accounted for by the waverings of Abdallah Pasha, between his favour for Sheik Beshir, and his fears"], [158, "144 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. of Mehemet Ali. The latter ultimately prevailed. Sheik Beshir resolved to produce an effect upon the mind of the Emir by imposing numbers. He there fore convoked folloAvers, adherents, favourers and friends from far and near. The gathering took place at Deir el Cammar, and thence he proceeded to Ibtedgen attended by 8000 persons. Were it not that the strings Avere pulled from behind and afar, the result might have led to the inference that the Emir was cleverer than the Sheik. The display Avas a failure ; the Sheik was kept wait ing and not admitted to kiss hands. The gatherino* instantly dispersed, and Jumbellat, too happy to be suffered to skulk away, accompanied by the Rosslan, turned his horse's head for the Hauran ; to re appear after some months on the sides of the Lebanon. The contest of the ichneumon and the rattle snake, if not fabulous, is the most wonderful of feuds. How the small, soft, delicate animal can avoid the coil and survive the venom of the asp is equally in comprehensible. When bitten, he runs to a hedge and is supposed to eat some herb, and then returns with renewed vigour to the contest. These flights to the Hauran remind one of the ichneumon. The bitten Sheik just sorushesoff\" ; just so returns. There is no field of political agitation, Avhich has like the Lebanon such a place of refuge at hand. In the Hau ran, there is neither possibility of pursuit, danger of surprise, or fear of treachery. It is a Druze country,"], [159, "EMIR BESHIR AND MEHEMET ALI. 145 but interspersed with Bedouin tribes; so that it offered at once ties of blood, sanctity of hospitality, remote ness from antagonists and independence of the rule of Pashas. A small body in pursuit could effect nothing. A large one could not be supported ; and if pursued, then in its rear rose the Ledja, which could be reached from every point. This Ledja is a mass of trachytic lava abrupt on all sides, elevated some hundred feet and extending fifty miles by thirty. It is broken and intersected by fissures and crevices, so as to form a labyrinth of rocks, cliffs and caverns, Avhere the fugitive Avould be as formidable to meet, as difficult to find. The knowledge of the existence of this retreat, for all parties had recourse to it in turn, prevented the idea of pursuit ever being entertained in reference to the Hauran itself; Avhilst to the facilities of flight and refuge thus furnished has to be attributed their readiness at any moment to engage in desperate enterprises. The services of the Hauran are not limited to the affording of protection : it furnishes also a means of assault. Once in safety there, the Emir, Sheik or partizan can communicate Avith every part and tribe of the Lebanon ; he can wait his time ; he can take his measures ; concert plans with friends, conceal them from foes, and then suddenly appear to ex change places Avith his rival. But in truth this is superfluous trouble; the mere knowledge that he is in the Hauran, keeps his antagonist in an agony of suspense, suspicious of every adherent, watching* L"], [160, "HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. 146 every motion. Besides he can always trust, like a Parliamentary opposition, to those in office for preparing his return.* From the Hauran Sheik Beshir emerged in the Metuali country to the north, there he was joined by the chiefs of Jumbellat, by the Amad his accomplice in the murder of the Abou Niket, by the Emirs Hassan and Selman, Avhose accession gave to the party all that Avas requisite for success, except the inves- titure of the Pasha of Damascus. In this ex- tremity the Emir Avas saved by the letters which Mehemet Ali addressed to Abdallah Pasha ; and so fearful Avas he for the fall of his protege, or so anxious for a pretext for entering on the Syrian soil, that an expedition of 10,000 men was ordered for the Lebanon.! Nor was this enough : a messenger * When the English garrison was quitting Calais, a French man called to them, \" When will you come back?\" An English soldier is reported to have replied, \" When your misdeeds shall have exceeded ours.\" t Emir Emm to his Father Emir Beshir. \" So soon as his Highness Mehemet Ali Pasha, the haughty lion, the destroyer of giants, learnt the revolt of Sheik Beshir, he was seized with a violent rage and swore that if need be he would send all his troops from Candia to the Lebanon, and that he would cover earth and sea with soldiers. Upon this we arose aud kissed the hem of his robe, and we said that this matter was not deserv ing of his passion ; that a look from him sufficed, that you were sufficiently powerful to chastise the rebels, especially with the aid of Abdallah Pasha. Nevertheless his Highness ordered 10,000 men to march with Toussun Pasha and us, but we prayed him to delay their departure until we had written to you.\""], [161, "EMIR BESHIR AND MEHEMET ALI. 147 sent with such haste that he reached Saida in six days, Avas directed to ascertain if a further rein forcement of troops Avould not be requisite ; but he returned the bearer of news Avhich put an end to the expedition ; Abdallah Pasha had his reasons for anticipating the arrival of Egyptian troops: he at once dispatched eight hundred men who drove before them the insurgents ; the minor Sheiks laid down their arms, and Sheik Beshir and his principal adherents Avere again off to the Hauran. Trusting* however to his former understanding with the Pasha of Damascus, he ventured into the neighbourhood of that city, and Avas captured with the Amad and the Rosslan, and sent to Abdallah Pasha. The question then arose, whether Sheik Beshir or Emir Beshir would bid the highest for the other's head. The influence of Mehemet Ali turned the scale, and Sheik Beshir with one of the Amad were strangled and their bodies cast into the streets: Emir Beshir paid 1,500,000 piastres. The old Amad Ali had already lost his head by order of the Pasha of Damascus : the Rosslan suc ceeded in escaping and fled, not this time to the Hauran, but to Anatolia. The three pretenders, Hassan, Selman, and Abbas, had been secured by the troops of the Emir, and were brought to Deir el Cammar : several years be fore they had signed a paper to the effect that if they a\u00b0*ain revolted, they consented to have their eyes put out and their tongues cut off. The document L 2"], [162, "HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. 148 was now presented to them ; having read it they declared it to be authentic: they had used their eyes and tongues for the last time.* The minister of Abbas, Sheik Merai Dadah, to save his thumbs, which the Emir had sAvorn to cut off, fled to France and is now a merchant at Mar seilles. The Christian Sheiks of the Kesroan and the family of Kazen were subjected to contributions. The government of Kesroan Avas given to a ne phew of the Emir, and heavy contributions struck on the districts chiefly compromised. Now comes in ordinary course the punishing* of foes, and the recompensing of friends. His partizans were so few, hoAvever, that as it was not to them that he owed his success, so Avas he not bound to consider them in the division of the spoils ; secure of Egypt, he could now, in the extirpation of the Sheiks, follow the example of his patron in his extirpation of the Mamelukes. The Sheiks of the Mountain combined a double character, and possessed rights of a two-fold nature ; the one proprietary, the other administrative. Al though their possessions and their feudal rights generally coincided as to place, it was not always so. We here touch on the feudal administration, but must divest ourselves of the false conclusions res pecting that system, which Ave have derived from * One of them, Selman, one of whose eyes had been spared in the operation, the lids being only joined, obtained five years after wards permission to have it re-opened, and the public belief is that the tongues of the others grew again."], [163, "EMIR BESHIR AND MEHEMET ALI. 149 observing it through its perversion and decay amongst ourselves. We understand it as possession of the land ; Ave have to understand it as possession of the tithes for the purposes of administration. The system Avas upset Avhen the land Avas usurped, and it is that usurpation which has brought the taxes of modern Europe. What the feudal system Avas in the Gothic States, when in their vigour, has been the feudalism of the Lebanon, up to the time of which Ave write. It is this difference which consti tutes that general elasticity of Eastern administra tions, Avhich enables the people to endure oppressions which Avould destroy any European one, and to re cover from disasters which would extinguish any European Government. This has therefore to be taken into account in explaining Iioav the people of the Lebanon were able to endure the frightful anarchy of their chiefs detailed in these pages. In Europe, the feudal chiefs passed by slow and gradual progression from administrators into pro prietors, the administrative power passing itself into possession. In the case of the Sheiks, that did not happen ; it has happened nowhere in Turkey.* The districts Avere administratively termed Mucatas; * The magnificent Turkish Army, and the restored finances have been furnished solely on this basis. What is absorbed as rent in Europe, here becomes the resource of the State, and the defence of the country.1 1 Note appended to note, 1SG0. The Loan forced upon Turkey during the pseudo Anglo-Russian War, of 185-1, had not occurred at the time the above was written."], [164, "150 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. the administrators, Mucataji. These holders ori ginally, as with ourselves, were yearly invested ; they then became hereditary without following the laAv of primogeniture. A certain Mucata belonged to a certain Beit or house ; it Avas left to arrange ment among themselves, who Avas to possess it, and how it was to be possessed. These chiefs collected the taxes, decided on differences, levied troops, di rected councils; and were in all cases the channels and intermediaries between the supreme g*overnment and the people. They received a percentage on the taxes and contributions from the people in kind ; levied fines for offences, and of course had the means, when the evil times began, of profiting by the au thority so possessed to get hold of land. They wormed themselves into possession, encroaching* on villages, by displacing proprietors, and even by ob taining fractions of possessions, and shares of single fields; thus securing by their property increased power, while using* their power to augment their properties : but it was always as so many individual acts; just as if they had stripped a traveller, or plundered a caravan. The chief who had displayed the greatest capacity in this kind of industry, was Sheik Beshir, whose possessions, moderate when he succeeded to his father, had increased at the time of which we are treating, to such an extent, that they included one-eighth of the Lebanon. It was only three generations before, that the people still remained the proprietory body, and that Mu-"], [165, "EMIR BESHIR AND MEHEMET ALI. 151 cataji and Emir did not hold, and were incapaci tated from holding, property. The first Shaab, on his election, had to renounce his private property. The confiscation of a fallen faction bore equally on office and property. Hitherto in the changes the feudal system had been respected, and the dis tricts, though under other chiefs, still remained sub ject to individuals of the families of the Sheiks, not to the direct authority of the head Emir. The private property of Sheik Beshir and his adherents was of course confiscated. Mehemet Ali took charge of his three infant sons, securing them as hostages for the fidelity of Emir Beshir. The fallen party was the great majority : their fiefs, instead of being distributed to other members of the same families, or to members of other families, Avere resumed by the Emir ; not at once as districts administered by him, but as fiefs of his sons or other branches of his family, all of Avhom had been reduced to the most abject dependence. The Kes roan had already been given to one of his nephews. The Arkouk Avas taken from the Amad, and given to his son Cassim. Jezzin, Gebel Rehan, and Tef fah Avere given to his second son Halil. The two Shoufs, and Lower Garb appear to be continued in the hands of the Sheiks, because administered by the Abou Niket and the Telhouk : but they were added to the districts, Avhich these houses, his only partizans (except the Abdelmalek), possessed, so that in realitv the order was here equally disturbed ;"], [166, "152 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. and one of these houses, the Abou Niket, had soon to resign their hereditary with their newly acquired possessions. Even in one of these districts, the Lower Garb, the country of the Rosslan, he had given the principal village to his nephew Emir Beshir Cassim ; and so the Sheiks disappeared. Revolutions, such as the one which we have here seen effected upon a small scale, when they have taken place in large communities have always been brought about by causes not here in operation. Under Louis XI. in France, and Henry VII. in England, the success of the monarch in extinguish iug the feudal power of the barons was to be attri buted to a combination between the King and the people for their mutual emancipation. The parallel revolution in European countries was also folloAved by consequences with Avhich that of the Lebanon has not been attended. Whilst the nobles Avere put doAvn as administrators, by acquiring possessions in lieu thereof, they retained not merely a station, but a balancing power in the State. In the Lebanon, the revolution sprung* from no alliance between the people and the prince. It was upon one another that the Sheiks were hard. Where they had pressed most heavily on the people, in the invasion of their property, the last gained nothing by the change : the Emir took all that the Sheiks had robbed, and himself Avas active in the same line. It repeatedly happened that applicants for redress against the exactions of his officers came and threw"], [167, "EMIR BESHIR AND MEHEMET ALI. 153 their title deeds at his feet refusing to retake them. The revolution Avas in favour of pure despotism, but a despotism Avhich was confined in too puny limits to fence or guard itself. After the Avhole power of the Lebanon had been concentrated in his single hand, a mountain fortress that had braved and stood every storm, and repelled every invasion that for twenty-five centuries had desolated Syria, became as weak as the unwalled village of the plain. This Aveakness, painfully present to the Emir, Avas not revealed to strangers ; nor was the true nature of the change penetrated by'-bbservers. The means he devised to remedy it in some degree, Avas no other than to arouse religious dissensions, to which, as we have seen, the people, by electing Mussulmans for princes, had remained strangers for eight hundred years, \u2014 an equal balance having been held between the two creeds. What then must have been the effect of the conversion of the ruling* prince to either of these faiths? That the conversion of the Emir was a matter of conscience no one will sup pose ; he is defended on the score of having been brought up as a Christian, Avhich is only an ad ditional charge, for he ostensibly professed Islam until the entrance of the Egyptians. Nor Avould his whole family have changed Avith him and been obedient to his orders, at one time to profess and at another to deny, unless the matter of religion had been treated as a common affair of profit and of policy ; in which the orders of the chief Avere to be"], [168, "154 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. obeyed, as in any detail of the government of a district or the management of a mission. As the Druze religion did not admit proselytes, that door was shut to him. Not haA'ing the spirit of proselytism it Avas not the instrument which he now required. The Sheiks whom he had to put down were Druzes ; it Avas against their enmity he had to secure himself. The Christians had now also Sheiks and they had a common interest as such with the Druzes. By professing Christianity he could carry others along with him to counteract that effect; the clergy \"became his active partizans; his persecution of the Sheiks would be explained as religious; he Avould gain the Christian population in spite of their chiefs. The Druzes not admitting and the Christians seeking for converts, it became easy to arouse religious dissensions, and thereby at once to obtain a cloak for his acts and to secure a majority for his partizans. The course he adopted Avas exactly suited to such reasoning. While con tinuing the outAvard forms of Islam, he observed the ceremonies of the Maronite Church in a manner which Avas at once concealed and ostentatious. Shrouded by the sanctity which Mussulman usage confers on the Harem, a chapel arose ; the penal consequences of apostacy Avere artfully used to im pose secrecy on the Christians and to spread amongst them the knowledge of the change. On the other hand the Druzes, wholly indifferent in as far as religious biasses were concerned, took no heed of"], [169, "EMIR BESHIR AND MEHEMET ALI. 155 these proceedings, and were unable to apprehend the consequences until involved in them. The Mussul mans from a distance considering* both parties as non-believers, had forgotten that the Prince of the Druzes was other than a Druze, and if a Druze he might be a Christian. If this matter was noticed at all it was as one of curiosity, and it was noticed only to be allowed to slumber ag*ain because felt to be atrocious. Abdallah Pasha Avas directed on one occasion to ask Emir Beshir of what faith he Avas, and an- SAvered by a question, \"Is he to be put to death, and hoAV, if the answer be, i I am a Christian ' V The matter Avas pressed no further.\"* One of the Shaab on the assassination of his father, denounced Emir Beshir and all the Shaab as apostates. On this the Emir issued a general order to his house, strictly to conform to the public ceremonies and stoutly to deny to the Mussulmans their Christian profession. The case had hoav arisen for the displacement of the present family and the election of a neAV one. This could be effected only by the union of the people ; but the very case consisted of their disunion. Unable to remove the Prince Avho had apostatised they had to bear the consequences, which was a house divided against itself. * On one of the occasions on which the Emirs Hassan and Selman were installed at Deir el Cammar, Abdallah Pasha sent thither a Mollah, to see that the ceremonies of Islam were duly respected by them and the public prayers observed."], [170, "156 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. As regards the Porte the matter was equally simple. The Shaab family had violated the funda mental law of the Empire, and thus had constituted themselves in open revolt. The case had to be dealt with, or the consequences accepted. The Porte had not courag-e to deal with it ; and it folloAved from that moment that the Lebanon became the vulner able and dangerous point of the Empire, alike as regards religious supremacy, administrative cohesion and foreign intervention. The results may indeed be lamentable, as regards human nature. They are but just penalties as regards the parties concerned. No sane man can expect, and no just one can desire, that a people guilty of such baseness, and a Govern ment of such dereliction should prosper or endure. There Avas, indeed, a time subsequent to 1840, as detailed in the Syrian Blue Book, and the revival of which, at the present hour, Avill be found in the Diary, Avhen the people again reverted to this door of escape, and proposed to petition the Porte for a Mussulman Governor. (As regards Deir el Cammar they did carry their purpose into execution and with success.) But by this time the Eno-lish Government had got such a hold of the local fac tions and of the Turkish functionaries, as to be able to frustrate the project, and so keep the Lebanon open for future convulsions ; representino* the measure as a violation of the faith of the Porte towards England, and an oppression of the people of the Lebanon. The French Government, not"], [171, "EMIR BESHIR AND MEHEMET ALI. 157 then so completely abandoned, did not share in these proceedings, and even, though timorously and secretly, assisted the project, in the hope of escaping from the embarrassments it apprehended, and the dangers it incurred of being* forced by French fanaticism to an active interference, by reason of the Avars of religious extermination which otherwise Avere certain to ensue. Each district Avas now placed under a Christian chief, on the grounds that he was a Christian ; the Christians being, with very few exceptions, the minority in each several division, and this in a society where all interests were dealt with by means of private intrigue. The agent of the Emir in these proceedings had been given him by Mehemet Ali ; he was a Greek Catholic, named Boutros Caramby. Emir Beshir can in truth be considered but as a blind, or at least passive instrument in the hands of Mehemet Ali, from whose brain emanated the plan, to whose agents its execution Avas confided, by whose power its success was ensured, and for whose ulterior purposes it had been devised and was executed. That purpose was presently revealed, in the en trance of the Egyptians into Syria. The connexion instantaneously received a two-fold proof in the events which immediately followed. The first, the open profession of Christianity by Emir Beshir ; the second, the declaration of the Druzes against Mehemet Ali."], [172, "158 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. The open profession of Christianity Avas not, how ever, a matter of easy accomplishment, even at that moment. The mere sanction of the step by Ibrahim Pasha did not suffice. It is Avhispered that menaces had to be employed. The sons of the Emir passed from the ceremony of baptism into the Mussulman ranks of the Egyptians, and were then sent to serve against the Druzes of the Hauran ; to return with all the rancour aroused by such warfare against their fellow mountaineers, and the insolent suffi ciency developed by intercourse Avith that bastard association of cynicism and pretence, that formed the Egyptian system. Mehemet Ali, by obtaining the apostacy of the House of Shaab, opened Syria to himself; for the Lebanon was the key to Syria. The same measure presented him to Europe as a favourer of Chris tianity ; and enlisted upon his side those active sympathies on the part of the people of Europe, which Avere the best calculated to mask the meddlino dispositions of their Government ; and also, as in the case of France, to constrain those Governments to come into his views Avhen they were themselves averse to engaging* in them. But the severest infliction Avas yet to come. Al though the Druzes pretended to be Mussulmans, it had never entered into the despotism of the Turkish Government to take them at their word, and require their military service. They were now to be held as Mussulmans, and called upon to enter those ranks"], [173, "EMIR BESHIR AND MEHEMET ALI. 159 from which to escape the fellahs of Egypt blew off their hands, and cut out their tongues. The Chris tians of course were spared. What could be the effect of this distinction between tAvo fractions of a population who had hitherto lived, as far as public burdens were concerned, on equal terms ? The Druze population en masse was subjected not to the conscription merely, but to persecution. Hunted, caught, manacled, they lost the flower of their arm bearing population ; and in three levies made during eight years, it Avas calculated that every Druze family had lost one member. Besides those who entered the ranks Avhere the service was for life, Iioav many Avere there Avho fled their homes to escape that fate ? Meanwhile, the Christians, Avho, from the causes already enumerated, were growing in numbers and wealth, free from all such fears, became possessors of the property of the expatriated Druzes : for every recruit that Avas taken left a family helpless. By purchase or mortgage, its lands passed to a Chris tian ; or he became proprietor where he had been farmer; or added to his own the deserted fields and plantations of his neighbour, wandering in the Hauran, or lost in the Egyptian ranks. What need to accumulate details: the results are there to speak for themselves. The rancour instilled in to the Druzes has exhibited itself in three ferocious religious Avars ; and the gratitude of the Christians to their perfidious Prince, and his more perfidious patron, signalized in their rising against Ibrahim"], [174, "160 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. Pasha and their instantaneous abandonment of Emir Beshir. These results did not indeed appear till fifteen years after, that is in 1840. I must uoav return to resume the narrative from the close of the career of Sheik Beshir. The recasting of the parts Avas completed in 1825. From that period until the rupture between Mehemet Ali and the Porte, no troubles arising either from internal or external sources, disturbed the repose of the Mountain or the measures of the Emir. He was allowed according* to his pleasure to change or modify the traditional powers of his office. His sons and relatives gave him no trouble : they shone by a reflected light. A \"strong* Government\" was es tablished : perfect personal security reigned. The Sheiks were swept away, as had been the Mame lukes or the Derebeys. The elements of religious war as yet slumbered only, and were unsuspected up to this point ; the Christians had been no more than favoured ; the Druzes only opjiressed. The siege of St. Jean d'Acre by Mehemet Ali, on the pretext of the refusal of Abdallah Pasha to surrender fugitives from Egyptian oppression, was in reality undertaken with a view to the conquest of Syria. The basis of the operation was the Lebanon. Emir Beshir remaining true to his sovereign, it Avould have been as easy for Mehemet All to have invaded the moon as to have entered Syria. When the critical moment came, the Emir did"], [175, "EMIR BESHIR AND MEHEMET ALI. 161 indeed waver ; he first sought to be excused, then entreated delay, at least till the fortress of Acre should fall. Mehemet Ali could not afford to be placable. He had already, through Boutros Caramby, got the complete mastery of the Emir, knew every transaction, every fraud, crime and weakness. The Emir might storm, writhe, devise, vacillate, but could not escape. In the Selamlik of bis serai at Ibtedeen, he was chained as if in the Castle of Cairo. He repaired to the camp before Acre, and Ibrahim Pasha paraded him first there, and thence to Jerusalem, Horns and Adana. The Druzes on the other hand, in as far as they were able, mustered in the camp of the Grand Vizir, and the last family left in possession, the Abou Niket, fled to the Turks, and appeared in their ranks at Homs and afterwards at Baylen. The Egyp tian intruder hoav completed the religious schism, pursuing everywhere the Druze as such, Avith un relenting hate, and in every possible manner favour ing the Christians. The Maronites thus got accus tomed to Avarlike expeditions, whilst of the Druzes, 5000 perished ; and to the quarrels of the Sheiks, succeeded the hatred of the people. I have already explained the facility of insurrec tion, and the frequency of revolution, by the proximity of the Hauran, It Avas necessary to the objects of Mehemet Ali to close this sanctuary. The Hauran, however, could not cease to serve as M"], [176, "162 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. a shelter so long as the Ledja behind it remained unsubdued. We must therefore again revert to that volcanic island. In reviewing its strength Ave will obtain an insight into the counsels of Cairo. The extent of the Ledja has been already stated at fifty miles by thirty. It is three days journey south from Damascus ; the highest points are five hundred feet ; the escarpment which it presents to the plain around, from fifty to one hundred. Throughout its Avhole extent it is destitute of water. Only in crevices and hollows is there any portion of earth, and such scanty soil bears brushAvood. It, therefore, does supply fuel to a limited extent. The rock is hard and porous, and works into such sharp points and edges that the strongest shoes are cut to pieces in a feAV hours. The Avhole mass is creviced like a glacier. To the larger chasms suc ceeds a supplementary system of cracks ; con stituting the Avhole into a network of ditches, parapets, passes, covered ways and pits. There are sharp angles where a single man may arrest a host; there are caverns where an army may lie concealed. Nor is this fortress one of unassisted nature. Man's labour has, through thousands of years, and an endless succession of untold feuds and unnarrated battles, completed her work. Wherever there is a level spot, it is traversed by dry stone walls ; where an insufficiently rugged ascent, there has been raised a succession of parapets; every improvable"], [177, "EMIR BESHIR AND MEHEMET ALI. 163 pass is shouldered by masonry and zigzags. In some tragedy, on a grander scale, of which the Ledja has been the theatre, a general strategic system has been connected with these defences in detail; and Avatch toAvers of a couple of stories ascended by a spiral staircase are concentrically placed, so that intelligence should be telegraphed from point to point, and from the circumference to the centre. Defensive Avorks are not the only vestiges Avhich it contains, there are ruins of churches which are early Byzantine : doubtless from the religious persecutions which drove so many of the Christians to the Avilderness, or forced them to take refuge either under Mussulman Governments, or in the profession of Islam. It was in 1837 that Ibrahim Pasha, in the course of his persecution of the Druzes, foivnd it necessary to sweep the Ledja. The first expedition composed of tAVO regiments found it impossible to effect anything and returned. A second and a stronger expedition Avas sent, but Avith no better success. The Druzes who had sought asylum did not amount in numbers to 2000 men, and yet the third expedition sent against them Avas raised to 18,000. The Egyptians reached the confines of the Ledja and encamped : all seemed deserted around. Breaking up next morning, they spread themselves over a large tract of the rocks and ad vanced imvards, as a body of explorers might do, confident of turning and crushing their victims by M 2"], [178, "164 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. the extent of ground they occupied in their advance and by their numbers. Soon, Druzes began to shew themselves at every point, jeering and beckon ing them on, but stopping neither to defend a pass, nor to fire a shot. They went on skipping over the ledges, dancing on the tops of the toAvers, waving their scarfs, and so the day passed from sunrise to sunset, when the Egyptians encamped, having gained but a feAV miles, and were allowed unmolested to take their night's repose. Next morning, the Egyptians recommenced their toil, and presently were brought up by one of those long continuous crevices, of which I have spoken. Here it was that the Druzes had resolved to make their stand. The Egyptians, overjoyed at the sight of an enemy awaiting them, rushed to the attack, and Avere repulsed Avith frightful slaughter. They were three successive times brought again to the charge, to be again thrice broken ; Avhen, in the midst of the panic that had seized them, they were ral lied by the appearance of a reinforcement coming up. The supposed friends were upon them only to deliver a fatal fire, and the Egyptians, now no longer able to distinguish friend from foe, scat tered in all directions, leaving two-thirds of their number on the spot ; nor Avould a man have escaped to tell the story but for the scanty numbers of the Druzes.

This defeat and disaster did not discourao-e Ibra him Pasha : the necessity of success was only rendered the more imperative. Suleyman Pasha was sent to take the command with new troops ; as the sunivors of the last expedition Avere so com pletely demoralized that they trembled at the name or sight of a Druze. The new commander saAv at once the impossibility of reducing the Ledja by force, and also the means of doing so through its destitution of water. Numerous tanks and reser voirs had been dug and built in former times to preserve the winter rains for summer use. There were fountains and Avells around within reach of the besieged. At these he established fortified camps, or caused them to be filled up; and the Avhole was blockaded, not by forces sitting down, for that was impossible, but by bodies of troops marching round to intercept communications. Gradually reduced to extremity, they sent away the women and children in small parties, and then made a sally Avith the intention of reaching their brethren in the Lebanon. They were, hoAvever, unable to cross the Bkkaa, and took refuge in the Gebel Sheik of the Anti- Lebanon. Suleyman Pasha pursued them, and enclosed them there ; again they broke away, and returned to the Ledja. Again he followed them, and again they regained the"], [180, "166 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. Gebel Sheik, where at last they were all put to the sword ; but not without the aid of treachery. A noted brigand, Chebly L'Ariane, had joined them, and been admitted to authority amongst them. He had been from the beginning in intelligence with Ibrahim and Suleyman Pasha, and betrayed them into their hands.* * Chebly L'Ariane, insignificant as he was, is still the kind of person fitted, like Abdel Kader, to become a European hero. Pou jolat makes him chief of the Druzes, under the name of Chebil ; says that Ibrahim Pasha offered 10,000 purses for his capture, which would be equal not, as he states it, to 125,000 francs, but to .-\u00a360,000 ; and describes him as delivering himself up to save his country from ruin. Ibrahim Pasha is made to address him thus: \u2014 \" Wear the sword which you have used so well. Arms are for the brave. If I had two such men as you by my side there is no enemy in the world that I would fear.\" After which, the \" Druze leader returns to the hills to put out the last spark of this memorable insurrection, which had cost the Egyptians 10,000 regular troops, besides other sacrifices.\" (Voyage en l'Asie Mineure, par M. B. Poujolat, Vol. ii. p. 567.) This work is a specimen of the unbounded facility of misrepresentation bj raeans of the complete ignorance of Europe on every point, and the passions which affect every man. It further shews how mis representation propagates itself, for the foregoing statement is embodied in a valuable work, first anonymously published, but since acknowledged, by Prince Frederick of Schleswick Holstein.

THE CONSTITUTION OF THE LEBANON EXTIN- GUISHED BY THE EUROPEAN POWERS. The reduction of the Ledja, completing the pos session of Syria for Mehemet Ali, Avas followed in course by a new attack upon the Sultan. With the resources of Syria in money, provisions and men, and the latter disciplined, the victory of Nezib was easily gained ; and had the combatants not been interfered with, the conseq'uences must speedily have been the restoration of the authority of the Porte throughout Syria, if not in Egypt. To Euro peans such a statement may appear a paradox or an impossibility. But that it Avas the conclusion of those who rule, is shewn by the steps imme diately taken at Constantinople by the European Powers to keep down the Turkish Government. They addressed to the Porte, Avithin thirty-three days of the battle of Nezib, a collective note. It is physically impossible that the intelligence of the event could have reached the remoter Govern ments, and the decision based thereon have been re turned to Constantinople in the time. But the batjfcle, and its issue, Avere perfectly Avell known beforehand,"], [182, "168 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. as all such events are noAV a-days, from the perfection to which diplomacy is brought ; just as the result of a race is known beforehand, when certain horses have been made safe. Thus the battle and defeat of Novara was publicly mentioned in London a week before it occurred; so that of Isted at Berlin, and so that of every diplomatic transac tion, in Avhich revolutions or armies are employed as the instruments. This \"Collective Note\" conveyed the menace of Avar on the part of entire Europe, in case an independent Sovereign refused to submit to the dictation of a rebel. Such a course could only have been adopted under a conviction similar to that which I have above stated. Namely, that the victory gained at Nezib by Mehemet Ali, would lead to the downfall of the Egyptian poAver, and the restoration of the authority of the Sultan. But, independently of reasons \u2014 what I here speak, I know. The \" Collective Note\" was not the only means em ployed. The defection of the fleet, and sudden death of the Sultan ensued, Avhich had also been arranged, as had indeed been the movement itself of Ibrahim Pasha. The pretext for this collective interference of the Governments of Europe put forth to their oavh subjects at the time, Avas, as it has always been, the protection of the Ottoman Empire.

In the prosecution of this design, certain of the Powers who had signed the \" Collective Note\" of 1839, turned round upon France, and signed the Treaty of 1840, on the pretext still of saving the Ottoman Empire, but from France, not from Mehemet Ali. The ex pected result of this operation was to drive France into siding* with Mehemet Ali, and conjointly at tacking* Constantinople ; when the pretext would have been ag*ain obtained for a Russian descent on the Bosphorus, especially stipulated for in the Treaty, and for a collision between the naval forces of Eng land and France, on the coast of Syria.* It was * Force of the respective Squadrons at the beginning of Au gust, 1840.

It Avas a conversation, which I had myself with M. Theirs, followed by a telegraphic despatch to recall the French squadron to the Pir\u00e6us, which prevented the second. The English squadron had been left with such an inferiority of ships, guns and men, as to have at once encouraged the French Commander to attack, and exasperated the British nation into a \" hot Avar,\" by the disas ters that Avould have ensued. The Treaty of 1840 was signed in London, and England appeared to the world as the soul of the enterprise. But no appearance put on and no ex- planation offered or accepted, can alter either the source of the Treaty or its results. The Treaty came ready drawn from St. Petersburg. The result, leaving Turkey aside, was the rupture of the French Alliance ; and no one could be found then or now, to believe that Russia's object Avas the good of the Ottoman Empire.

In 1839 the same elements of insurrection in Syria against Mehemet Ali existed as in 1840. They had not shewn themselves pre\\'ious to the battle of Nezib because of the total inaction of the Turkish Government. After the battle of Nezib, these elements were compressed by the ' collective note ; ' or rather by the imbecility of the Turkish Government in submitting to it. In 1840 these elements Avere evoked, but it was to be done not by the Porte but by an English squadron on the coast, the distribution of arms and proclamations. A course Avhich again sheAVS that the ** collective note ' was based upon a due estimate of the circumstances. The appeal Avas instantly responded to ; the French association with the Maronites was utterly disre garded, and Ibrahim found no Syrian true to his colours save a few poor Druzes, the last remnants of his persecutions Avho had been forced into service in his ranks. In defence of Emir Beshir no hand Avas raised ; nor was hand required to pull him down. English Commissioners summoned him from Bey rout to their presence. On his scorning obedience he was declared fallen. In three days he had to appear as a suppliant. He wanted to go either to bis Sovereign or to his old patron the rebellious Pasha. Both requests were refused and he Avas"], [186, "172 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. told to select some other place of refuge; to which he answered in the language of hi3 country, \"then send me to hell.\" But the word which in his country's language represented hell was Malta, whither he was conveyed, and where to his equal surprise and disgust he Avas landed, and told that it was done at his OAvn request. So ends the his tory of the house of Shaab ; so ends the story of the Lebanon. From the period of the connection of this country Avith Egypt, we have ceased to be engaged in track ing our way through its events. We have been seated as spectators watching the. progress of a drama written before hand ; where the personages declaim passages, concerted for the catastrophe. Von Hammer stops short in his history of the Ottoman Empire at the treaty of Kainardjiin 1774, because from that period it was impossible to Avrite it. Henceforth, he says, the different States of Europe are moved by springs, the secret of which is knoAvn only at St. Petersburg. The history of the Lebanon, certainly since 1840, has been managed by three of those Governments (Turkey, England and France) who have ceased to have a history of their OAvn. At best, the Lebanon from that period affords a small chapter in the history of Russia, as adding one to the many fields of political and religious rivalry, for the PoAvers of Europe."], [187, "HISTORICAL CONFIRMATION. 173 CHAPTER XVI.

The present volumes being called for by passing circumstances, the manuscript has been placed in the printer's hand, without even the leisure for a previous perusal.

It was only Avhen the preceding sheet Avas passing through the press, that I looked at Gibbon, and haAre in consequence added this in tercalary chapter for the folloAving reasons. The native authorities might be supposed to over rate the importance of their people. The statement in the foregoing narrative most likely to aAvaken surprise, and provoke contradiction, is the Aveight Avhich I have attributed to the Lebanon in deter mining the relative positions of the Caliphat, and the Greek Empire. A common perusal of Gibbon or any of those general histories, which are undertaken"], [188, "174 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. merely as compilations having reference to the name of some people, or of certain ages of the world, Avould lead the reader to infer that my statement was apocryphal. I therefore quote on this point a passage from Gibbon, which is in itself a full con firmation, Avhilst the phrases which accompany it, would produce exactly the contrary effect upon the reader. For at one and the same moment, he de signates the Mirdites as being* one of the firmest barriers of the empire ; and, as being* disarmed and transplanted by the suspicious policy of the Greeks. I subjoin in a note the entire passage.* * \"The event of the siege (of Constantinople) revived both in the East and West the reputation of the Roman arms, and cast a momentary shade over the glories of the Saracens. The Greek Ambassador was favourably received at Damascus, in a general council of the Emirs or Koreish \u25a0 a peace, or truce of thirty years was ratified between the two empires ; and the stipulation of an annual tribute, fifty horses of a noble breed, fifty slaves, and three thousand pieces of gold, degraded the majesty of the Commander of the faithful. The aged Caliph was desirous of possessing his dominions, and ending his days in tranquillity and repose : while the Moors and Indians trembled at his name, his palace and city of Damascus was insulted by the Mardaites, or Maronites, of Mount Libanus, the firmest barrier of the Empire, till they were disarmed and transplanted by the suspicious policy of the Greeks. After the revolt of Arabia and Persia, the house of Ommiyah was reduced to the kingdoms of Syria and Egypt ; their distress and fear enforced their compliance with the pressing demands of the Christians ; and the tribute was increased to a slave, a horse, and a thousand pieces of gold, for each of the three hundred and sixty-five days of the solar year.\" \u2014 Gibbon's History, Vol. vii, page 5."], [189, "HISTORICAL CONFIRMATION. 175 The next point is that connected with faith. William of Tyre, to put forward a successful prose lytism, represented the Maronites as Monothelites. Consulting noAv European Avriters, I am amazed to find that this ridiculous perversion is spread through all authors, and all ages. Gibbon, with the happy facility of sounding phrases which seem to have been composed by themselves, and then drawn at hap-hazard from a box, to be appended to proper names equally draAvn at hazard, mixes up the truth and the falsehood, so as to lead the reader into a maze, and then to send him forth filled only with the sense of the Avriter's universality of knoAvledge, and conclusiveness of judgment. \"\u25a0 In the style of the Oriental Christians, the Monothelites of every age are described under the appellation of Maronites, a name Avhich has been insensibly transferred from a hermit to a monastery, from a monastery to a nation. Maron, a saint or savag'e of the fifth century, displayed his religious madness in Syria ; the rival cities of Apamea and Emesa disputed his relics, a stately church was erected on his tomb, and six hundred of his disciples united their solitary cells on the banks of the Orontes. In the controversies of the Incarnation, they nicely threaded the orthodox line betAveen the sects of Nestorius and Eutyches ; but the unfortunate ques tion of one will or operation in the two natures of Christ, Avas generated by their curious leisure. Their proselyte, the Emperor Heraclius, was rejected as a"], [190, "176 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. Maronite from the Avails of Emesa ; he found a refuge in the monastery of his brethren ; and their theological lessons were repaid Avith the gift of a spacious and wealthy domain. The name and doc trine of the venerable school Avere propagated among the Greeks and Syrians, and their zeal is expressed by Macarius, patriarch of Antioch, who declared before the Synod of Constantinople, that sooner than subscribe the two wills of Christ, he Avould submit to be hewn piece-meal, and cast into the sea. A similar or a less cruel mode of persecution soon con verted the unresisting subjects of the plain, Avhile the glorious title of Mardaites, or rebels, was bravely maintained by the hardy natives of Mount Libanus. John Maron, one of the most learned and popular of the monks, assumed the character of Patriarch of Antioch ; his nephew Abraham, at the head of the Maronites, defended their civil and religious free dom against the tyrants of the East. The son of the orthodox Constantine pursued, with pious hatred, a people of soldiers, who might have stood the bulwark of his empire ag*ainst the common foes of Christ and of Rome. An army of Greeks invaded Syria; the monastery of St. Maron was destroyed with fire ; the bravest chieftains Avere betrayed and murdered, and twelve thousand of their followers Avere transplanted to the distant frontiers of Armenia and Thrace. Yet the humble nation of the Maronites has survived the empire of Constanti nople, and they still enjoy, under their Turkish"], [191, "177 HISTORICAL CONFIRMATION. masters, a free religion and a mitigated servitude. Their domestic governors are chosen among* the ancient nobility ; the patriarch, in his monastery of Canobin, still fancies himself on the throne of Antioch ; nine bishops compose his synod, and one hundred and fifty priests, Avho retain the liberty of marriage, are intrusted with the care of one hundred thousand souls. Their country extends from the ridge of Mount Libanus to the shores of Tripoli ; and the gradual descent affords, in a narrow space, each variety of soil and climate, from the Holy Cedars, erect under the weight of snow, to the lime, the mulberry, and the olive trees of the fruitful valley. In the twelfth century, the Maronites, abjuring the Monothelite error, were reconciled to the Latin Churches of Antioch and Rome, and the same alliance has been frequently reneAved by the ambi tion of the Popes and the distress of the Syrians. But it may reasonably be questioned, Avhether their union has ever been perfect or sincere ; and the learned Maronites of the college of Rome have vainly laboured to absolve their ancestors from the guilt of heresy and schism.\"* This accumulation of misstatements is further ac companied by foot-notes, which lead the reader to infer, not that the author is contradicting the au thorities he quotes, but that he is copying* them. For instance ; in support of the statement, if the Avord can be applied to such loose phraseology, * Gibbon, chap, xlvii.

That author asserts the direct contrary. He says, \"The disciples of St. Maron kept aloof from all the sects.\" \" The Monastery of St. Maron rendered itself cele brated in the East, by the inviolable attachment of its religious, to the holy doctrines, Avhich they de fended alone against the heretics.\" (page 40.) After mentioning that the Monophysites were called Jacobites from their founder, who maintained in Christ two substances and one sole nature, he says that Jacob Avas opposed by John the second Maro. (page 44.) \" This voyage to Rome and this patriarchate of John Maro are confirmed and described at greater extent in some Arab histories, Avhich relate that he set out from Syria Avith a Legate of the Pope ; that having arrived at Rome, his creed Avas examined, that he was afterwards created Patriarch of Antioch, whither he repaired, and Avhere he extinguished heresy ; at last, that he retired to Mount Lebanon with all the Jacobites whom he had brought back to the Church, and that he Avas received by the people Avith universal joy.\" (p. 48.) Gibbon also quotes the Dictionary of Assemann, as proving the identity of Maronites and Monothe lites. Assemann, as the folloAving passages will sIicav, states exactly the contrary."], [193, "HISTORICAL CONFIRMATION. 179 \"John Maro, (elected Patriarch of Antioch, A. d. 073,) having converted many to the orthodox faith, the Latins of Antioch moved thereby, presented him to the Cardinal Legate of the Roman See ; and bv their suffrage John was created Bishop of Botrus, (Patroun), that he might preserve the Lebanites in the Roman faith.\" (p. 499.) \" Edenensis and Nairen contend that on the oc casion of the Avar, the name3 of Melchites and Mar daites began to be heard in Syria, that the latter, folloAving John Maro, were called Maronites, and that they preserved the orthodox religion in Syria ; that the former, because they followed the Emperor, were called Melchites, that is, Imperialists, and that these were Monothelites.\" (p. 507.) The Edenensis, here mentioned, means a Mirdite from the town of Eden ; this reference shews that that people was not destitute, at the time, of native writers. The Maronite priests, in translating to me their own ecclesiastical writers, gave me no grounds for inferring* that the institution of their Patriarchate was in any way connected with foreign influence. The Roman writers Avould, of course, desire to es tablish such a connexion, for which a colour Avould be given by the voyage of John of Maro to Rome. One point is, however, most satisfactorily estab lished ; that the term Maronite, at this period, had no reference whatever to any population ; and Avas simply the name of a religious sect, opposed to the Monophysites and Monothelites, in which they N 2"], [194, "180 HISTORY OF THE LEBANON. agreed with the Greek Church ; these heresies having been successively condemned at the Council of Chalce don, A. D. 451, and the Council of Constantinople, A. d. 680, but opposed to the Greek Church on the matter of the procession of the Holy Ghost. They maintained in fact in the East, and alone maintained there, the essential doctrines of the Church of Rome. In their subsequent union with the Church of Rome, similar concessions were made to them, in regard to their liturgy, to Church dis cipline, language, and celibacy of the priesthood, as were made with the so-called United Greeks and Armenians, with whom their position Avas perfectly analogous. The perusal of Gibbon leads to the conclusion, that the year 1860 was not the first in Avhich the freest scope Avas opened for misrepresentation in respect to the Lebanon. The tone of that misrepre sentation is, hoAvever, the opposite to the prevailing one at present. From him no one could gather that there was dissent or difference. The Druzes are not so much as mentioned. The same may be observed in the work of Cardinal Dandini, who went to the Lebanon in the middle of the last century as a Legate from the Pope, and who, in his account of the country, at least in the English edition, does not once use the word Druze.

The first is of course the house of Shaab ; the second, Jumbellat, which we were going to visit. Mir Emin told me that he was quite a young man ; that his father was the celebrated Sheik Beshir, Avho, rich, cunning and powerful as heAvas, never was per mitted to sit in the presence of Emir Beshir. When he observed that the Emir was cutting* off the chiefs of the Druzes, he knew that his turn would come ; and Avhen the Emir turned Christian he sud denly raised the country, and surrounded Beit ed Deen (Ibtedeen, as it is commonly called) Avith eight thousand men. Emir Beshir had recourse to the Pasha of Acre, Abdallah Pasha, who secured Sheik Beshir. He offered to the Pasha \u00a3100,000 for his release ; Emir Beshir \u00a3200,000 for his head, and got it. He then attacked and destroyed the palace at Muchtara, which stood on the opposite hill before us, confiscated his goods ; his sons and dependants were scattered and took service under the Pasha of Egypt.

The manner of dinner they observe here had overwhelmed him. The dishes endless, and the dimensions enormous ; he declared that 200 persons might have dined from the meal presented to him. One of the dishes was a heap of pilaff, and on the top an enormous sheep entire, decorated with garlands. The sheep here are fed like the geese for Perigord pies ; they are tied each under a mulberry tree, crammed with its leaves and washed daily four times ; they have also large tails. But the strangest part of the hos pitality Avas the demeanour of the host, which ended in a fit, after Avhich he lay on a sofa unable to move for tAvo hours. It was not till after much cogitating\" that it occurred to Izzet Pasha, that the fit he had been seized with was terror, and that he had been watching his movements, expecting* a sign at some moment that should signify the close then and there of his youthful career. So this explained the enormous rations, by means of which the appe tite of the Pasha Avould be so glutted, that Sheik Said Avould not at that time be required. HoAvever, the respite of tAvo days had restored him to equani mity ; and I never saw a young* man who displayed a more thorough consciousness of longevity. One consequence Avas, that the dinner was disappointing. I complained very much that Izzet Pasha having had"], [204, "190 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. a whole sheep to himself, Ave four should not have even half a one between us. On this I Avas asked to stay to-morrow, and that I should have a dozen to myself. Said Bey, on being sent for, came and sat doAvn at table with us. The table Avas got up in the Frank style, indeed out-doing us; for instead of table cloth it had the cover of a boudoir table, but Ave ate Avith our fingers. He retired immediately after with Mir Emin. Emin Effendi, Izzet Pasha, and I Avere left to our pipes, our coffee, and ourselves. In the course of the evening, I bethought myself of going and paying a visit to our host. I found him in the midst of a croAvded divan. My arrival occasioned g*reat surprise, but evident satisfaction. The only chief of distinction there, AvasHattar(or Hallar), who served as interpreter, as Said Bey speaks but little Turkish. Hattar is a man of little wealth butpreat influence. His air is that of a bandit. Said Bey abounded in his expressions of gratitude and devotion to the English. He made anxious inquiries respecting Colonel Rose, Avhom he called his patron and protector. I asked him what he thought of the measure which had assembled so large a number of guests around him. He said, \"It is the order of our master and must be good.\" I asked if it were good in itself, or because of him who ordered it : he remained silent, when Sheik Hallar with emphasis said, \" It is good in itself, and it is only ordered by the Sultan because demanded by the people.\""], [205, "VISIT TO SHEIK SAID. 191 Said Bey said that he could not part with me to-moiTOAv ; that he. had expected a visit, and hear ing that I was at Deir el Cammar, had sent ex pressly to request one. That his man finding me at the Palace, had not ventured to go there, but now his good fortune having brought me, he could not consider this a visit, since I had come Avhen it was not he who Avas master of his house. This amia bility did not efface, though it smoothed down, a sombre air and sinister countenance. They are an incomprehensible people. Seeing a body of them assembled, I have always the idea of a number of compressed storms ; a man's interest consists in hoAv he stands with this one or that. I Avas speaking of our Poor LaAvs, and telling them that Avith us every large proprietor had to pay a considerable sum for the support of the poor. Said Bey imposingly replied, \"We give to the poor one half of our revenues.\" The scene described by Izzet Pasha shews how they can be frightened. The Consuls, every fifteen days, send some piece of frightful in telligence, which they are ready to believe. 2Glh. \u2014 It has been determined that I am to remain here a couple of days. Emin Effendi's departure took place this morning with his train. Izzet Pasha remains to prosecute the numbering* of the people. The numbers which they had returned for this place themselves was 30. He has found 140. He merely counts the houses, allows three souls to each, and then estimates the probable number between the"], [206, "192 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. ages of 20 and 60 who are liable to the tax. He guesses the state of the Mountain (that is the two Caimacanships, extending from Tyre to Tripoli) at 70,000, and these are to pay, I find, 20 piastres each. On calculating the amount, I was infinitely surprised to find that nearly one half of the tribute \u25a0will be made up from the poll-tax; so that the cen sus, the object of all this commotion, is, after all, for the rating of the property for raising no more than \u00a32100 ! The Porte expends twice that sum for its share in the work. The people offered to bear the entire charge, but the Porte would not allow them. It is absurd, therefore, to look on the opposition of the chiefs as occasioned by un willingness to be taxed ; it is the loss of revenue they apprehend, in a stop being put to arbitrary exactions. I find considerable apprehensions respecting the drafting for the army, recollecting as they do the administration of Mehemet Ali. As yet nothing has been said respecting recruitment. The Turkish military service is by no means so heavy a burthen as continental conscription. The lot falls only on those betAveen the ages of 20 and 25. The term is but five years. Chiefs of families, only sons, and those engaged in study, are exempt. From those liable, the lot takes one in eio-ht or one in ten. They are Avell fed and clothed ; they have the bath gratis, or frequent it at less than Id. They receive a relatively larger pay than the British sol-"], [207, "193 VISIT TO SHEIK SAID. dier, and twelve times as much as the Russian. Many not drawn offer themselves, and those Avhose term is expired frequently offer to re-engage. The inhabitants of the country are either Chris tians of various sects, or Druzes, Avith some few Shiites, called here Metuali. Druzes, though openly conforming, are not held to be Mussulmans. As rayas they would not be subject to military ser vice ; but they do not pay the equivalent poll-tax or charatch. The present poll-tax has been pro posed by themselves as a means of raising the tribute. We have received intelligence that a Chamber lain of the Emperor has arrived at Beyrout, and that the Russian flag Avas flying at the fore of the Russian steamer in sign of its great gestation. The Prussian Consul has also been to the Pasha to say that he, too, had a traveller for the Mountain. This, as may be imagined, has produced a great sensation, and I was besieged with interrogatories. The first question always was \u2014 \" Is Russia, too, going to meddle in the Mountain ? \" By the na tives the question was not put without evident satisfaction, just as at an English election the news Avould be received of an additional candidate. It is natural that they should seek a third protector, for the protegees of each power suffer from the other. Said Bey is persecuted by the French Consul for a sum of money ; against this his patron, the English Consul, cannot shield him, so a third protector is an 0"], [208, "194 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. object to all. I replied to them, that I did not think Russia had any such intention. This ansAver was not at all to their minds. The Turks Avere surprised, and I explained that she would make use of the Mountain to provoke the rivalry of England and France, and for this purpose it was requisite that she should not appear on the field. Izzet Pasha said that gave him the key to something the Russian Consul had said to him, and which he could not comprehend. \" His Government,\" according to M. Basili, \" had sent him instructions to meddle, like France and England, but he, out of regard for them (the Turkish officials), and wishing to live in good harmony, did not obey his instructions, and never in any Avay interfered in those affairs. If he learnt anything of importance for the Turkish Government he never failed to communicate it to them for their guidance, and he took no part but so far as to be of service to them.\" What did this mean, said the Pasha \u2014 a Russian Consul who does not obey his instructions, and who tells us so ? Noav I understand that he Avanted to make us feel the obligation Ave Avere under to them, and thus contrast their conduct with that of the others. However, the Russian Consul gains nothing by it, for it is perfectly Avell knoAvn that he works the others. Even the English dragoman remarked in the Pasha's saloon that whenever his Consul be came busy or angry, the Russian had just paid him a visit. A word of Mir Emin, Avho I am sorry"], [209, "195 VISIT TO SHEIK SAID. to say had a fit of the ague last night, shewed me in a striking manner the demoralizing effect of these intriguers. He said that the Pasha of Beyrout sometimes sent him an order to arrest a man in consequence of a charge brought against him ; the man would be arrested, and the affair put in order of adjudication. A few days after wards a letter aaouW come to this effect \u2014 \" The English or French Consul objects to the proceedings, you must, there fore, liberate him.\" I have consequently written to beg the Pasha not to mention the Consul's name, but simply to send a pardon, Avhich I may publicly read to the people. Emin Effendi and the Caimacan being gone, Izzet Pasha busy Avith his census, and Said Bey with his guests, I betook myself to the bath. I had not visited this part of the building before, and I did not look for the splendour of Ibtedeen, but I was surprised Avhen led through an ante-room, that just held a Avide sofa, into a small cupola of fourteen feet square, with two recesses similarly diminutive ; one of them containing the Haous, the plunge bath, or piscinum, of the Romans. It Avas neat however ; laid in slabs of carrara marble Avith slips between of their OAvn beautiful stone, running through a gamut of shades, from white or pale stone colour to brick red, and of consistency, from the friable limestone to flint. The prevailing material is lithographic stone. It is cut easily and smoothed down or polished by rubbing the softer Avith the o 2"], [210, "196 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. harder, and cracks easily into rectangular masses. For building in every shape and for ornament it is impossible to imagine a material better adapted. All the buildings are with vaults in stone ; the streets in the towns may be said to be vaults, and the inlay ing or mosaic in stone or marble, is the ornament of the country. They have also an indurated shale, which is hard enough to take a polish and is jet black ; it contains bituminous matter enough to burn when put in the fire. Of all species of apartments the bath is the one requiring- and calculated for, the display of marbles and mosaic. That of Said Bay, humble as it Avas, was the only ornamented part of what remained to him as a house, and just the thing* I have fixed upon for wishing to have, and hoping to live to see, attached to every cleanly gentleman's establishment of modest fortune in my own country. On inquiry I found this was not the bath belon-riii\" to the serai ; it had been ruined with the rest, and this one had been built by Said Bey. The cost was about \u00a3350. In England it might be built for the same, or less, and with a better and larger ante-room might accommodate fifty persons a day. Said Bey now rose in my estimation. When making these ob servations I little expected that my pride Avas about to have a heavy fall, and on the most tender point. If there was one thing belonging to the bath that I imagined I understood it was the shampooing of the foot; if there was any part of the human body that I conceived 1 duly estimated, or the sensual"], [211, "197 VISIT TO SHEIK SAID. enjoyments derivable from which I fully possessed, it Avas the foot. I noAV discovered that I had lived in thick darkness in respect to everything connected with it : being asked if I should like to have a sham pooer, a man whom I Avas told Avas perfect in that line was sent for. After considerable delay he made his appearance \u2014 a tall, gaunt figure, with wiry and hairy limbs \u2014 and at once seized upon my feet and treated them with an art and dexterity AA-hich the tractatrix of Martial might have envied. The rest of the body engaged little of his attention, and indeed so much time was consumed that twenty four hours Avould scarcely have sufficed for the opera tion had it been extended to the, in his eyes, evidently inferior members. The attendants crowded round \u2014 I dont mean the attendants at the bath, but from Avithout \u2014 in their heaving* abbas and ample turbans, and watched with curious eyes the cracking of each toe and the mesmerizing of each spot. The sun had already dipped behind the hills when I descended to the esplanade, of which there are two, one in front of the building's and commanding a beautiful view of the valley ; across it ran a stream of water which poured over the edge, and turned a mill beloAV. It overlooks to the north- east the other esplanade, on which the game of jereed Avas exhibited on our arrival. These must be remnants of the Crusades, for the name given to them is \" Phantasia.\" Here I found the Pasha walking, and the eroAvd"], [212, "198 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. assembled and standing at a respectful distance. He seemed embarrassed, and had evidently some thing unpleasant to communicate ; at last he made up his mind, and said, after a deprecatory preface, \" I think you ought not to stay in this house longer than you can help.\" I inquired what had hap pened ; he answered, \" I know nothing, but I sus pect that Said Bey has received a letter from your consul.\" I asked him why he had not sent for me immediately, that I might have started, as noAv it was too late that night. He answered that it was only while walking there that he had guessed the cause of several things he had observed during the day, and which shewed that my presence was very embarrassing to our host, and which he could only attribute to the consul's writing to warn him. We found the dinner table laid for tAvo only, but sent to invite Said Bey's presence at supper. He came, and I thought that I perceived the same embarrassment ; he drew his chair away from me, never addressed me, and when addressed by me merely replied. Immediately on rising from table he disappeared. HoAvever, about an hour after wards, and when Ave were discussing whether I should not pay him a visit, and try and compre hend myself if there Avas any foundation for our suspicions, he entered the apartment. He placed himself far away, and on the other side of the Pasha, contrary to his habit. I carefully abstained from taking part in the conversation, and on his"], [213, "VISIT TO SHEIK SAID. 199 being called out, I requested the Pasha to avoid any topic connected Avith politics ; for I had come here a guest, had been kindly received, and Avished to avoid anything that could be disagreeable to my host. The Pasha smiled, and no sooner had Said Bey returned than he commenced questioning him about his property ; how many mills he had, how many houses, how many mulberry trees, Iioav many olives, where they were, Avhat they returned ; and at last I perceived Said Bey become rather uneasy. The Pasha noAV continued with a bland pertinacity and the most infantine simplicity, to inquire what brothers he had, hoAV old they were. He Avas astonished to find one older than himself, appealed to me as to the extraordinary nature of the fact, asked me if in England such things happened. I was on thorns, and threAV out signs of distress. The Pasha was blind ; his questions continued. The young man explained that his father had left in his will that the cleverest of his sons should succeed. The Pasha Avas delighted, admired the usage, and hoped it Avould become general ; then asked him who had decided in his favour, and put him in possession. He replied, the Turkish Government, who had ordered that the custom of the country should be observed. He then asked if that Avas the custom throughout the country. \" No, it Avas only in their family.\" At each neAv embarrassment and contradiction, the Pasha was more and more de lighted and complimentary*. The young man became"], [214, "200 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. more and more confused, his speech embarrassed ; he became first incomprehensible and at last mute. I then interposed, and asked him about his horses ; he turned to me as to one who had come to his rescue, and the Pasha turned round with a sly look, as if to say, \" Did you not see Avhat I Avas after ?\" However, the questioning he had undergone had evidently led him to make serious reflections on the precariousness of his own tenure, and the letter of the consul, if letter he had received, had lost its charm. Suddenly he addressed me in these words, \"What do you think of the Mountain, and Avhat will you say of us when you go away ?\" I an- SAvered, \"I shall say that Said Bey received a stranger like a prince.\" \" But Avhat more will you say ?\" \" That I knoAV nothing.\" \" But you have asked me nothing*.\" \" Do }-ou Avish me to ask you?\" -\"'Ask me Avhat you like, I shall answer you by mouth or in writing.\" \" I have already asked you, and you would not ansAAer me. I asked you last night everything*, when I said Are you satisfied Avith the Messaa ?\" \"But Hattar Bey ansAvered you.\" \" Yes, he did.\" \" But I told him in Arabic Avhat ansAver to give. And noAv I will say more. I was before against the Messaa, I am for it hoav. The Sultan has not sought it ; the people sought it. I have been in Egypt, and, though young, can understand the difference of a Sultan and of a Pasha.

You shall not go away from the house of a Jumbellat, and not know what the Sultan has done. The Mountain produces ship loads of oil and silk. There are 40,000 men fit to bear arms ; and all the Sultan takes from us is \u00a317,000 ; Avhoever heard of such a tax ? Then he pays back to us for ourselves \u00a313,500. Then the troops here, by Avhich Ave have our present properity, cost (giving the details) \u00a330,000. Then the commission we asked for, and which Ave offered to pay, but which he pays, comes to \u00a32500 for the year, so that he lays out money for the Mountain. He has taken no one's property. Emir Beshir took \u00a3200,000 a year, oppressed the people and cut off the Sheiks. But this is not all ; Ave are noAV saved from two things, that did us most evil. If a man committed a petty crime, the Emir took money from him, and his servants too, so every accusation was believed. If a great crime Avas committed there was no redress but by the musket, and therefore Avas the Mountain filled with hatred, and the interest (saida) of every man was not what he could gain, but how he could injure his enemy.\" Here he stopped, leaving the Pasha and myself in astonish ment. On my expressing my surprise to hear from him such things, he asked why ? I answered, in consequence of Avhat I have heard at Beyrout and elsewhere. \" What have you heard ?\" \" That the Mountain was divided into two parts, and the one looked to France to aid them, the other to England,"], [216, "202 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. and that could only be because they were oppressed by their Government.\" He was embarrassed and did not answer. The Pasha then said, \" My surprise has been not less great in consequence of what I have heard of you at Constantinople and at Beyrout among my peo ple.\" \" What was that ?\" \" That you were our enemy ; that you hated us and plotted with every foreign intriguer, whom you thought Avould help you. You knoAv that from the time I first saAV you at Ibtedeen, I have been your friend with the Pa sha of Saida, and you know that such and such a conversation took place respecting it :\" the Bey assented. \" I then looked on you as a young man whom kind treatment might recover. I now see that you are an intelligent one, and really and in heart our friend. I am proud of what I have said in your behalf. I Avill be your vakil henceforward, \u2014 Avhen you come to Beyrout, you will be my guest, and Avhoever touches you touches me.\" The Bey did not respond, and for some time he was a prey to anxiety, which I thought I could read. I believed every word he had spoken to be honest ; it Avas the truth but not the whole truth ; his position of dependant Avas fixed, his animosity against, and fears of, the French party Avere fixed. He Avas probably deeply compromised, and in the back ground there was the dread of the Porte, and the idea of protection against an extreme case by"], [217, "VISIT TO SHEIK SAID. 203 means of his foreign connexion ; in fact he had nei ther light to see his way, nor resolution of character enough to walk of himself. He again turned to me and said, \" What do they say of me in your country ?\" I answered that in my country they are busy about their own affairs, and knoAv nothing and care nothing about what passes elsewhere. \" Ajaib !\" he exclaimed, \" but then what do they say of me at Beyrout?\" \"The last thing I heard of you Avas that you had had a meeting of your friends, as you fancied held with the utmost secrecy, and that you had sent for a relative, in whose village there is an American Mis sionary, and sent him down to the English consul at Beyrout, to consult him about getting up a sham quarrel to distract the Turkish authorities, and befool your friend here, the Pasha, and so get the Messaa put off for the Avinter, fatigue and dis gust the Porte, and thus leave you the people to oppress as before.\" As I proceeded, I observed his face work and his knees tremble, but I Avent on. I Avas resolved not to be the occasion of a sham reconciliation, and, since Ave had entered on the matter, to do Avhat I could to make both make clean breasts of it. The Pasha, on his side, was equally embarrassed, and threAV out such signals of distress as he had disre garded when made by me. The Bey now commenced a long explanation, so mumbled that I could scarcely comprehend a word."], [218, "204 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. The Pasha deprecated, the Bey persisted, and when I had left them sufficient time to become hopelessly embroiled, I interfered, and said that I had cited the incident only because he wanted to know what was said of him. I did not ask Avhether it was true or false ; but Avhile such things were said, it was clear that they would be repeated. They Avould travel to Constantinople, they would be written to Paris and London, Avhere the Turkish Ambassador would hear them, and write them ag*ain to Constan tinople. The effect would be to raise suspicion there, and the day might come that an order thence would send him to prison, or dispose of him without it ; and neither on one side his European friends, nor on the other his friend the Pasha be able to save him ; or the French Government might be exaspe rated, and raise the Maronites, and his house be burnt again. The Pasha took up my Avords, and repeated them one by one, adding that I had ex pressed what Avas passing in his OAvn mind. The Bey then asked me what he should do. I ansAvered that if he could do Avhat I should advise, I had told him already. \" You have told me nothing.\" \" Did I not say to you when I arrived, Let your past adversity be a jewel ?\" \" What did that mean ?\" \" Experience. Now I shall be more explicit. If I were in your place I should reason thus:\u2014 I have seen my father slain and his homestead ravaged, yet I, who am not his eldest son, have come into possession of all his lands : I am head of the first"], [219, "VISIT TO SHEIK SAID. 205 house among an ancient race; I have authority placed in my hands ; all this I owe to my sovereign, a sovereign avIio dealt kindly with my country. My father Avas but a servaniin this country, I have be come chief; if disturbances occur I will suffer first and most ; let me then avoid the very appearance of what Avill give umbrage to that Sultan. Nothing* can do so more than concerting* with foreigners.\" The Pasha again repeated my Avords, and dwelt upon them, and after a great deal more in the same sense, and it being* now near three in the morning, he took his leave. I retired with him, not wishing to remain alone with the Pasha ; but after I had gone to bed and everybody had retired, the Pasha opened the door, and sitting doAvn on the bed said, \" I could not rest till I had told you that, if he was in the wrong, Ave were so also ; twice he has been thrown into prison, and though no doubt that Avould not have happened had he been prudent, yet Ave ought to have taken another course and made him find in us the protection he sought else- Avhere.\" Then, after some civil speeches on the course I had taken, which I did not fail to recipro cate, he retired ; and, satisfied with the results of the evening, and thinking I had brought both par ties to look favourably on each other, I turned my face to the wall, and slept. 27th. \u2014 This morning I awoke with less confidence. Said Bey is in character suspicious, irresolute and Aveak, and the tempter is at hand."], [220, "206 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. The forenoon was spent in noting what went on in the room in which the Pasha was proceeding with his census. Said Bey Avas exceedingly active \u2014 sending man after man to detect concealed persons, and each neAv pressure bringing more and more men to light. It Avas like an oil press \u2014 another turn and another squirt. The chiefs helped the Govern ment to detect the men, the people to detect the pro perty. There Avas now no longer any objection to my remaining here this day as I intended originally, and Said Bey Avas anxious to keep me, so I allowed the Pasha to depart alone in the afternoon. Our host did not feel himself bound to the like demonstra tions as on the departure of Emin Effendi, and did not accompany him. Coming immediately to me he said, \" Now that I am my own master I wel come you.\" I said, after the departure of your distinguished guests I am a small matter; he re plied, half embracing me, \" You suffice for me.\" I begged him not to think of me, but to attend to the troop around him, and he went, saying, We will have at least the evening* to ourselves. About sup per time I received a message to know whether he and I should dine in the front hall by ourselves, or whether I should like to see an Arab dinner ? Choosing the latter, the tray was brought into the room where I Avas sitting, and fifty or sixty persons crowded in after it. Now I understood the pile of pilaff of which the Pasha had spoken. The cloth was laid on the floor, then the stool, scemni, then"], [221, "VISIT TO SHEIK SAID. 207 the brass tray, or sofra. So far it was Turkish, noAV slipped in the Arabic; a large tray was brought in and set doAvn, and the whole contents transferred to the table (sofra). From the centre, from a deep round copper dish of the size of a Avheelbarrow's Avheel, rose a pile of pilaff; but twice as large must have been the tray that bore the whole sheep. Around this Avere placed the dishes, like the planets round the sun ; the thin scons Avere rolled up and laid on the ground all round under the table. When the Bey and I Avere seated, he invited from the group one by one till Ave Avere ten : that is as many as could comfort ably sit. I Avas waited for to beg-in, and pleading* my ig*norance he shewed me the Avay. They eat the pilaff, not at the end of the meal, but with every dish, pouring spoons full of the sauce of the dish they like best on the part of the pilaff they dig in. There was a dish before each ; they Avere all differ ent, and each skipped about to his neighbour's mess. I did not vary my attentions, chancing in that before me, if not on one better than I had ever tasted, at least on one better than Avhich I had never tasted. It Avas a ragout of mutton, the meat soft as butter without losing its flavour. There Avas a green vegetable, wild herb, Avith an agro dolce sauce, the sweet and the acid of Avhich were slio-htly touched, and its soupcon of richness em bellished the simplicity of the pilaff when poured over it. The meal is despatched rapidly ; as each finishes,"], [222, "208 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. he rises and retires back, the lein-brick* is brought to him to wash, another takes his place at the table, and so on till the Avhole are served. Thus it is that the enormous piles of pilaff Avere explained. We sat doAvn ten persons to a meal sufficient for sixty, and it Avas finished ; for. reversing our order of courses, six times, not the dishes, but the guests were changed. Yesterday there had been five such tables, and Said Bey told me that he has at times fed 1000 persons, and that the tables Avent on for two hours ; allowing ten minutes for each five tables, Avould just suffice for that number. This is indeed lordly and patriarchal hospitality, and covers a multitude of sins. I do not know that the chance of having* the roof burnt doAvn once in ten years, Avhen so redeemed, may not outweigh the churlish tranquillity of our ensured residences. Those aa ho sat are partizans. Thus it is that Sheik Said ex pends his substance on the poor. The cookery here offers peculiarities and dishes unknown to the Turks. The seed of the fruit pine, scattered all over the country, is used, as in Eng land in the time of Elizabeth, in every dish, SAveet and savoury\u2014 to the savoury it gives melloAvness, to the SAveet, substance and flavour. Of the SAveet dishes I remarked two, one in which it is steAved in the celebrated dried apricots of Damascus, the other small patties Avith a shortbread crust composed of this pine-seed and almonds crushed together, with a * Ewer and basin."], [223, "VISIT TO SHEIK SAID. 209 sprinkling of semolina and sugar. One dish re minded me of the many resemblances I found be tween the cookery of Barbary and the Highlands : it is shortbread. It is served as square cakes, the thickness of our shortbread. The resemblance first struck me, but when I tasted I thought it different, and inquired how it Avas made, and Avas told it Avas with equal parts of flour, sugar and butter. It then occurred to me, as the composition was exactly the same, that the difference of taste arose from the butter having* a bad flavour, and semolina being used instead of flour, which made me suspect that it contained almonds. The Highlanders, not having semolina in the north, have substituted flour ; I would recommend to our housewives to return to the original plan. Semolina is not the word, but bourgoul. The grain is malted, dried and crushed. It makes an excellent pilaff', and for all culinary purposes is pre ferable to flour. It makes better soup than maca roni, and from it they make their delicious pastry. It acquires such tenacity that the thin leaves are formed by taking a lump and throwing it out so that it falls on a slab of Avood ; the pastrycook shifts his hold, turning it and throwing it, till it stretches out as thin as a sheet of paper. The sprouting causes increase of bulk, and if the process is arrested at the proper moment a slight and agreeable acidulation is acquired, together with i\""], [224, "210 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. the softness and remarkable tenacity of substance which I have described. When 1 rose from the table the Bey rose too, but he told me he did so on my account, as the mas ter of the house has to sit on till all the guests are served. We retired to the large hall, and thither one by one the guests folloAved us. In their portly abbas and white turbans, as they were seated around on the floor or the divan, they might have been grouped for a picture of Kaled and his companions reposing after the conquest of Syria. I had fre quently remarked that common character of decay in the Arabs and Greeks \u2014 loquacity ; but these Arabs, if Arabs they be, have retained what the Greeks have lost \u2014 ceremony and silentiousness. But this only holds in a social point of vieAV ; once any sort of business is begun their tongues are set loose and there is no stopping them. My host seemed to set about thinking* of the things that Avould interest me, and Avith the occa sional assistance of a squinting* Deli Bashi, succeeded in communicating* to me many thing's I was glad to know. One person he pointed out to me of the blood of Emir Beshir, Avhose father had taken part in the persecution and death of his father. He told me that some months ago God had sent him a son, and during a month the house Avas croAvded with people who came to Avish him joy, for the people loved him much ; some had come three days' jour ney. What could I say to them, said he, but"], [225, "* VISIT TO SHEIK SAID. 211 \" God grant that your children may live ; \" and then I set meat before them, and I sat with them while they ate.

A Druze may become a Christian, but no Chris tian can become a Druze ; those that are Druzes were Druzes from ancient times, and no more can become so. The peasantry on his lands pay him one-third of the grain, Avhere the seed and oxen are their oavu. They give him half of the silk and oil. When he had exhausted his budget, of which I give the above as samples, he began to question me; first as to the points of a horse, and then as to horse racing. Then he proceeded to the House of Com mons, and inquired Avhat their business Avas. He could form \u2014 happy ignorance\u2014 no idea of any business of an assembly, besides the municipal affairs of their own Megilis. When I attempted to describe a law, he was driven to extremities like myself, and ap pealed to every one round the room if they had ever heard of such a thing. I endeavoured to explain it by \" the plan of Chekib Effendi ;\" then they said, \" That happens once for all.\" I told them we made such plans every year, and Avhen 1 mentioned that Ave made in one year as many as 200, there Avere p 2"], [226, "212 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. exclamations all round of Vai ! Vai ! and the busi ness of a European assembly assumed in their eyes form and consistency. 28th. \u2014 I have described our host's dress on the day of our arrival. The next day he wore the uniform of Mehemet Ali, in whose army he had held the rank \u2014 a very low one \u2014 of Yuz Bashi. The officers wore it of any colour, and his taste was not mani fested in the selection. It Avas grey with black em broidery ; and with his sallow complexion, and heavy features the change was more remarkable than even in ladies who by chance have on one day a dress that suits their complexion and the next, one that suits their taste. To-day, the official personages being gone, and perhaps also in consequence of a discussion Ave had on dress, he appeared in the long oriental anters and jubbe ; the latter was of canary yelloAV cloth lined with sable, the other of rich yellow silk, and the shalvars of the same. I don't know if the colour was selected with a view to com plexion, but he seemed to be parading the properties of a theatre before a rehearsal of Bayazed or Othello. I was to start this day, and as I remained later in my room writing, he came to me and said he was very busy ; but that if I would not stay another day he must put off his work that we might have some time together, as he had much to say to me. He had sent for a young man Avho had been in Eng land to serve as an interpreter, and had before offered him to me, to go with me. He was sent for, and the"], [227, "VISIT TO SHEIK SAID. 213 first word he uttered in translating was, \" What is the Prince's name in England?\" I did not know what to answer, us I saw he Avanted to get again on poli- tics, and I merely said, \" We don't change the names of strangers.\" He got angry and sent the interpreter away. He then commenced himself a long story about the English and Turkish Governments being one, and his being a great friend of General Rose (they do give brevet rank), and his anxiety to put things in order, and to put an end to feuds. We were interrupted by dinner or breakfast, and Avhile the interpreter was presenting me with a napkin after washing, Avhen we Avere done, he whispered, \" What my master Avanted to know, when he asked youAvhat hisname was in England, Avas, if the English were going to make him Emir of all the Mountain, like Emir Beshir.\" To avoid further discussion, as I saw how useless it was with such weakness and such passions, I hastened my departure, and Avent only to take leave of him. He would not, hoAvever, let me go, he sat down : the conversation he said Avas left unfinished, and Avent on, \" and I have a question to ask you : the Arabs hold to the sacred- ness of bread and salt, you have seen much, you knoAv our affairs ; I have no one else to tell me Avhat I am to do.\" I inquired if his question had reference to gaining* something he had not got, or to keep ing Avhat he had. He seemed to guess my meaning*, and earnestly disavowed any ambitious plans. He pressed again, and I said, a man cannot serve two"], [228, "214 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. masters. Rescue the mountains from this disgrace ful dependence, and you will make yourself indeed a chief among your people, or at least you will be an honest man. He again appealed to the bread and salt. I told him that all I had said was for his good. This conversation vividly recalled the last one I had had with Milosh. He told me of Constantinople being made a \" Free port \"; and I ansAvered him, that within the year he would be a fugitive at Odessa or a Avanderer in America. But he Avent to Semlin, not Odessa, and started in fourteen months, not tAvelve. The Bey was sumptuous in the leave-taking; honours and ceremonies in these countries are a possession Avhich are neither trafficked with nor given away : to me they Avere prodigality itself. He kept standing on the terrace till I Avas out of sight, much to my annoyance ; for my hired horse, with mean equipments, though a good roadster, was a stubborn brute at starting.

We descended into and crossed the valley by the road by which Ave had arrived. I had not then, however, half seen its beauties; there are two water falls under Muchtara ; our road lay up the valley, and after climbing nearly to the top, Ave had to pick our way along* the ledge of a precipice, whence the vieAV Avas alarmingly lonely. It is not here as else where, mountains, hills, plains and valleys ; other names must be invented. The valley is one of de nudation, cutting* throug'h a stratum of limestone, at least a thousand feet thick. This stratum is composed of layers of rock varying from two or three to twenty and thirty feet in thickness, of different degrees of durability, the thicker being* the hardest. These courses are repeated, so that there are forma tions ; on one escarpment I counted about thirty. The effect may be imagined of these tiers of preci pices or rosy rock, with entwining patches of rich soil, carefully treasured up and planted with trees of dark foliage. The larger streams cut straight courses through this mass, but wherever Avater gathers, filters or"], [230, "216 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. flows, the mass is cut into ; the terraces follow the windings of the soil, braving it round headlands, nestling through coves ; here stretching in straight horizontal lines for miles, there piled up one above another in endless rows, in the hollow of steep and valley, as if they were the seats of an amphitheatre for nations to assemble. These terraces are generally not more than six feet Avide, and you see the Druzes turning, scaling*, and descending them, with a plough like a rude branch, and a pair of cattle ap proaching in dimensions to, and vying* in shagginess with, goats. On the summit of this mass the stone is so flat that threshing floors are made by SAveeping the earth away. These look like patches of siioav, over which sand has bloAvn. The first time I saw one I could only make it out after close inspection. This is the rock which gave to the Mountain its name of \" milk.\" But it is not the Mountain as seen to-day that suggested the epithet. On the morroAv of the Deluge there Avere tracts Avhite as milk ; and the scanty sprinkling* of soil which noAv impairs its brightness, must have been far scantier still, Avhen the Hebrews first beholding it, designated it Avith that monumental exactitude, Avhich charac terizes the nomenclature of the ancient world. The valley of Muchtara into Avhich I was now looking, combines as much of the peculiar culture of the country as is compatible with Avildness, as much of the grandeur of its scenery as may be allied to"], [231, "A SHEIK'S HABITATION. 217 softness. The rectangular shape and fantastic colours, the theatric blocks, and masonic precipices under the tempered sky of opal or of amber, make it appear like a thing of paint seen through an atmo sphere of glass. There is the distinctness of Cuyp or Berg-hem given to rocks, designed with the archi tectural hardihood of Martin, and here and there interspersed groups such as might have been supplied by Watteau, had he had Druzes for his models. I am citing Watteau and Cuyp and Martin for scenes which embellished the poetry of the Bible, and Avere trodden by the sandals of the Prophets.* What can better render the diversity of its nature from our conceptions of grandeur, and its beauty from thoughts of grace which the masters of art have gathered ill our climes 1 The trees, besides the olive and the mulberry, are the fruit-bearing* pine, the turpentine pine, the prickly -leaved oak; these are rare on the bare moun tain side, they are however found in the villages or along* the terraces, with the poplar and a tree like the oak called mace. The deciduous trees have now lost their foliage ; the verdure is less than at other seasons.

The villages and horses have also their dis tinctness; and the flat roof and the grey sward wall, and the not unfrequent Saracenic or Gothic arch bear, as everything else, the impress of Palestine. I am writing this a day after its date, and after travelling for a day between the first and second ridges of the Lebanon, and I may here add Avhat this second day suggested. I never saw a region which so graphically presented the event, and so dis tinctly preserved the traces, of an upheaving of the strata. There is the mass which forms the first range and which presents its escarpment to the sea, lying flat; its substance and contents every where exposed by the gnawing of the water, so that it is like a cut-out piece of pastry. On the eastern side it is twisted up and broken off; it recurs in frag ments, and then is laid up on end and forms the ridge of the Lebanon. No deposit of any kind has come to interrupt the complete view of the operation ; you see as it were before you the Avhole mass heaving up, then bursting in the line of the present chain, the thrown up fragments sinking in, and leaving* the one great streak on edge. The various qualities of limestone, so useful in building, are thus found every Avhere : interspersed with it is a small seam of clay, with shells imbedded, which serves them for pottery and for various domestic purposes. They make jars for their grain, &c. in wicker, and plaster them with this"], [233, "A SHEIK'S HABITATION. 219 clay : they make beautiful smooth floors Avith it, and singular fire places. They work their doors, AvindoAvs, and presses, all round in figures of it, and then paint them in colours. I frequently remarked the emblem of Morocco, the double triangle, while much in the raised acu pointed figures bore also a close affinity to the Moorish. It is but the ruder houses that are so embellished, the clay not being capable of receiving the same finish as the gypsum : it is also used for their terraces. Lime, strange to say, is not used ; you see it at times employed in building, but very rarely ; either the stones are fitted together Avithout any cement or more clay is used. The terraces of the houses are also of earth and clay, and in some places a caoline earth is pounded and added. They are consequently very heavy and have to be rolled after every rain ; the weight is thus enormous, yet every dAvelling is liable to a forcible entrance of the storm. The palace of Ibtedeen is so constructed, and one night of storm while I Avas there every body was on foot all night. From this digression I must return to the terrace along the valley of Muchtara, I expected to travel all the Avay along it, but Ave rose to the edge, and as we passed over the level summit, a headland of the dissected stratum seemed to advance, like a cut out scene in a panorama, to shut out the view. We Avere not long in reaching Beth Loon the residence of Hattar Bey, a sorry village of 25 houses : that is,"], [234, "220 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. 25 might be repaired out of twice as many in ruins. It stood on the brink of the precipice ; and on a pro jecting ledge an oak fixed into the massive rocks afforded at once a point of view and a signal object. There a carpet and a cushion were spread, and there I was served with sherbet, coffee and nargilla. The house inhabited for the present by the Bey is of the humblest order, and his'son, the father being absent, and his feAv attendants, recalled the Avilder districts of Albania. The room Avas curious ; in the middle a column supported the roof; it was wood Avork all round and panelled on the tAvo sides facing- each other. There were small trap slides near the floor, about a dozen in number, and corresponding doors as if to lockers above ; these were stores of grain, rice, flour and bourgoul, which are poured in above, and as wanted, drawn from the trap slides beloAV. Besides these, there Avere spaces left for pigeon holes one above the other, and narrow presses for hanging clothes. On the other two sides were alcoves surrounded with very nice carvings in wood, and curtains draAvn across, they exactly resembled the standing bed places of the Highlanders. I thought they Avere for the same purpose; but they. were only for stoAving the beds which at night are laid down on the floor ; the one custom explains the other, and they are evidently from the same source ; the mattress is called by them mattra, the coverlid has (hap). There were, among other Highland things, the wooden candlestick placed in the middle"], [235, "A sheik's habitation. 221 of the floor, and the box with the tAvo inside boxes across, the tops of \\A'hich being raised keep up the lid ; then at supper Ave had scons and shortbread. The scons are thus made. A fire is lit in a small round oven, like a chimney-pot set in the ground ; Avhen sufficiently heated, the scons are thrown so as to stick on the side and are cooked immediately. They are laid down at meals like a mass of doubled neAvspapers; they are called Marcoop. The supper was very tolerable, sweet dishes prevailing ; when Ave Avere done the table Avas removed near the door for the attendants ; and a poor old man, a passing* stranger, Avalked in, and after saluting sat down \u2022 Avhen he had eaten he in like manner retired. The people here looked worse than I had seen them before, and onaskingtheTurk Avhom Ifound here, respecting* their state, he said, \" they are very industrious, every house here has possessions of its OAvn, some are very poor as you see, but none Avant a bellyfull. What can you expect after seven years of burning ? What serai or village of the Druzes that the Maronites have not destroyed, or if the Maronites, that the Druzes have spared. Then the people of the Hauran came ; then the Arnauts of Omar Pasha ; and the people were then stripped as Avell as the houses : even the Tantours Avere collected for the silver.\" I asked Avho Avas to blame for all this. He said, Mehemet Ali in part, but chiefly themselves. He had a black servant Avho Avent out with me, A\\hen I took a stroll in the vivid moonlight ; he treated them"], [236, "222 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. Avith less ceremony, said they were no better than animals ; and, drawing himself up to his height and standing on a sort of pedestal formed by a ledge of rock, the moon shining on his black features and re flected from his jetty skin, he seemed to retaliate all the European scorn on these remnants of Europe's earliest models. I had been so many nights without a flea, that I had forgotten their existence, and did not rig my preventive curtain. They marched up to their nightly feast over the mattrass on either side, Avith the steadi ness of phalanx \u2014 I slaughtered till I Avas tired, and then had to make an outcry and get my curtain ; but it was of little use as they had invaded the co verings I had to take with me ; so I never closed an eye. What a strange existence for these agile little animals, to find a mountain of roost nightly laid out for them on Avhich they scramble, and then \" Look around \" And choose their ground, \"And take their slice.\" The natives here take no heed of their depredations and Avere infinitely amused at my trouble. One of them said, \"Our Bey could not sleep Avithout a couple of hundred of them in his bosom,\" indeed they seem to derive a pleasure from the titillation. I have heard of a girl who Avas so fond of wasp stings that she caught them and kept them for her private gratification, so it might be that the lesser vemon of the flea may not be altogether disagreeable to skins"], [237, "a sheik's habitation. 223 long used to them, and Avhose apprenticeship began in the cradle. Some purpose may also be intended, they may serve to vivify the skin and supply the place of cleanliness or to enforce it : they serve as a drain, and I should calculate that the people eat at supper a couple of mouthfuls for the supply of the fleas. 29th. \u2014 I started to-day for the south, hankering after Tyre and Sidon. I had nearly to retrace my steps, and crossing the valley and ascending* the opposite cliffs, I returned for some time along its brow, and then ascended the higher part which runs under the lofty ridge of the mountain. I passed through five villages, viz. Baruk (25 houses), Maa zin (25), El Chraibe (70), Badaran (15), Gibea (15). At El Chraibe I rode into a serai now in ruins ; Avhich from the Avails and its height might have been taken for a ruin of the Crusaders, yet it was ruined only three years ago ; it belongs to the Jum bellat family, but must have been erected by them from some ancient house, if I may judge by the ancient and handsome tombs still standing before it. The tombs of the Druzes have three ornaments ; tAvo like heads of Thyrsi, and one in them in the middle like a fleur-de-lis. These are equally at the head and feet, but on these ancient ones they were only at the head, and the covering of the sarcophagus was of a peculiar form. As to the age of the build ings, there is no means of making it out ; the dura bility of the stone, the permanency of usages and"], [238, "224 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. the dryness of the air which leaves no moss or ver dure, deprive you of all means of distinguishing that which has just been raised from that which has en dured a couple of thousand years. As I entered Niha, I came upon a house of which the Avails might have been taken for those of. an Hellenic city. At this place I was unAviilingiy detained, as it Avas but 9o'clock, according to the Turkish manner of reckon ing ; that is, it Avas yet three hours to sunset ; Ave stopped at a good looking house. I had g*ot off before I found that the master was not at home, but a boy his son, and a girl, Avould not let me go, so I went up stairs. The women wore the Tantour; they cleared out a very nice room, and presently an old dragoman was brought to act as interpreter. He told me that the mistress of the house bade me welcome, and, as I had expressed my anxiety to get on that night, pressed me to stay ; that the house was mine to-night, to-morrow, or as long as I chose to stay. Everything- was here as different as possible from last night. If that reminded me of the wild Albanians, this did of the civic Greeks of Roumelia, before they had got the ill manners of Europe. The room had its floor in clay, which Avas covered with mats and rugs ; the walls were in clay, figured and coloured round the windows and apertures. The mat was removed in one part where was the holloAv place for the fire, of charcoal of course. When I was seated, the younger branches of the family came to make their salu-"], [239, "A SHEIK'S HABITATION. 225 tations, and on being told to be seated they sat. I find it impossible to describe these things, they are inconceivable to us, and yet they are the most in teresting part of travelling in these countries. Re latives then came in and began to apologise for the absence of the master of the house, and to supply his place. Fire was placed in the smooth cup-like hollow on the floor, and charcoal heaped on it ; then an iron platter, with long ornamental iron handle and a spatula secured by a chain. I could not think Avhat it Avas for, but soon saw it filled with coffee from a leather pock ; it was the toaster ; whilst my coffee Avas preparing, a collation appeared of milk, honey, sweetmeats and scons, AA'hich they eat toge ther ; they double up the scons like a little bonnet, with this they take a little dibs, then put it into the milk ; dibs, milk and cake all go into the mouth together. It Avas quite charming to see the sedu lous decorum of the Avhole family, the children striving* as to \\\\ Inch Avas to bring* the napkin or pour the Avater ; all the service of the house seemed to be performed by them. From the terrace I counted forty houses inhabited, and forty houses in ruins. 30*7i. \u2014 A heavy rain detained me this morning for three hours ; it then cleared up, and I proceeded to the clambering up and down which in this coun try is travelling. A few slight changes deprived the scenery of its Lebanon peculiarities. Instead of the rectangular masses Avhich made every water- <i"], [240, "226 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. course a valley of denudation, I passed over slant ing strata, presenting the escarpments chiefly to the Avest and allowing the water to run doAvn their backs. Instead of the pale rock there is a mantle of colour and light. Gebel-Lezin rose in front, se parated by a deep gully running from the south to meet the river of Sidon. The sombre day deepened on this mountain its murky hues. Presently the clouds dispersed, the sun shone out and called forth its strange colouring, deep red broAvn, to dark green and black. The dark pines looked lig'ht on its inky sides. Our track lay along* the valley on the upper part of the talus, and under a chasm of precipices, in one of them, which stood boldly and fantastically forward, I Avas told that there was an extensive fort quarried in the rock, in Avhich flocks of sheep might be stoAved. This Avas the last refuge of the celebrated Fakreddeen. I could distinguish a couple of apertures Avorked by man : the entrance was too far off to visit. We came in about two hours in sight of the village of Le zin, at least of a large establishment, with terraces laid out square on the sloping back of the prolon gation of Gebel Lezin. It was right before us, and I expected that a deep chasm must separate it from us. Presently I found this was the head of the valley, and the stream there leaps over a ledge of four or five hundred feet, and then reaches zio--zao down to the bottom of the chasm. I sent the horses on to the village, and Avent to the centre of the"], [241, "A SHEIK'S HABITATION. 227 point of vieAA-, looking right doAvn the valley, and having* a full vieAv of the Avaterfall on my right. There I sat till a thick cloud, that had mustered in the bottom of the valley, had travelled up, and the rain began to fall abundantly. I should have been thoroughly Avet before reaching the village, if an umbrella and cloak had not been pressed upon me by a lady at whose house I had stopped to ask for a cup of coffee. Here, too, the master of the house Avas absent, but his wife, a remarkably handsome Avoman of about twenty-five, with an air of resolution fit for a grena dier, made me understand that I Avas Avelcome, and the house mine for this or any other sort of weather. The house was large and empty. She was alone, so to avoid giving trouble, I asked to have some pilaff, but nothing else. She sent to me for five piastres (Is.) for rice, as her husband had left her no money. I inquired to Avhat creed she belonged, and Avas answered \" Christian.\" The value of rice Avas not more than 20 paras, 40 of which goes to the piastre. The room I was shewn into resembled in every respect a barn, save that the Avails and floors were plastered smooth Avith clay. Along one side a mat Avas spread, and higher up carpets, and still higher coverlids (shilteh). It was about 30 feet square, and with two stanchions to support the transverse trees Avhich sustained the roof, and Avhich Avere not Ion\"* enouo*h to reach from Avail to Avail. This was Q 2"], [242, "228 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. one half of the house ; the partition wall was com posed of clay bins. After I had contemplated sufficiently the beauties of this place I thought I might venture but, that is into the outer apart ment. It was like the one I left, empty and bare, except that near the door there was the little fire place, mocade, which might be taken for some cu rious desk set down there by accident. They seem to make it a rule never to place it regularly, that is, at an equal distance from any two points, or parallel to any line of the building. My hostess seemed surprised, but welcomed me. The cold that had accompanied the rain made the fire an object of considerable interest. She had been squatted on a small square coverlid at her cookery ; she brought me a similar quilt and cushion, and laid it on the floor on the other side. She then continued her work at my pilaff, driving aAvay the fowls Avith a long reed, and, in the interval of both occupations, smoking a nargille. It was the graush, or nut nargille ; so called from having* a cocoa-nut for the bowl. It has no snake, but a straight reed ; the stalk is held while you smoke. It is the same as the Calioun of the Persians. After a feAV whiffs, she handed me over the nargille, Avhich I, in like man- ner, returned. When the rain ceased, her sister came in, very like her, Avith less beauty and more liveliness, and of all the Arabs I have seen the one best qualified to teach Arabic. Her nargille too Avas brought, and the tAvo sisters, sitting toge-"], [243, "A SHEIK'S HABITATION. 229 ther, were a vignette for the Arabian Nights ; they soon dropped their veils, which at first they had held across the face, and presented in a hovel the grace of a studio, and the manners of a court. A wonderful charm is given to society by the use and recurrence of a form of salutation not performed by taking off a piece of dress. Eastern conversa tion and intercourse is interspersed with salutations, as writing is with various signs that mark pauses, inquiries, or admiration. The Arabs are even more sedulous than the Turks, and they add another mo tion. The Turkish Temenas consists in raising the hand to the lips and forehead. The Arabs carry it first to the heart, and the motion is singularly graceful in Avomen. In the course of the evening two brothers-m-law came in ; like the sisters, they were handsome and Avell-dressed. The oldest, about thirty, Avas most pre possessing in manners and appearance, and I Avas more and more astounded at the demand of the five piastres for my supper. ElseAvhere, my hosts, to Avhom it would have been a deadly affront to offer anything, Avere on the alert to prevent presents from being given to the servants. When, next morning, I was leaving this place two of those who had come in the evening, came to ask for money, and then ran to their mistress to shew it ; in my presence she counted it over. This whole village was Christian. The apartment I have described had on two"], [244, "230 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. sides the bins of clay, and in one of them there being an opening, I asked leave to inspect it. I found within a small slip made the most of for other bins, and jars, one of which contained Leben or Yourt, prepared for winter by being drained, then rolled into balls and preserved in oil. I tasted one and it had little or no acidity. I give a plan of this house, as it is a fair specimen of their buildings. The tAvo rooms do not enter into one another, they both open into the corridors, at each end of which there is a small separated room about eight feet square. There are no chimneys, but there are small square openings in the wall near the top on every side. Slst. \u2014 This Avas a beautiful morning. I could not leave this place without returning to have a view of the valley and the waterfall, the volume of which was noAV much increased. The water is cutting\" its way upAvards over the ledge of rock, reminding me of Pella in Macedonia. There is a magnificent theatre of cliffs cut out in like manner ; along my course soutlnvard the valley ascended, still cut out by the water and each harder layer formed a ledge for a little waterfall. We were now approaching the southern extremity of the Lebanon. From the day before we had lost the horizontal masses ; here the stratum Avas inclined, and when Ave got out of the valley as it were on the surface of the mountain, the strangest appearance Avas presented. The grey rocks stood up or lay all around, you could move"], [245, "A SHEIK'S HABITATION. 231 in no direction Avithout clambering over boulders or square fragments which sometimes looked like towers ; or the rock was honeycombed and worked into holes and crevices. It was a wilderness of stones. This thorough contrast with the rectangular massive and smooth surfaces of rock, was produced by no difference of substance but solely by a slight change of position. This stratum Avas inclined, and consequently Avhen the softer stone was worn away the hard stratum above broke off and tumbled or remained standing ; whereas, Avhilst lying* horizon tally the upper one protected that which was be neath, and they were regularly eaten away together and only on the edges ; that is, on the sides of the valleys. We noAv descended through these heaps of stones, and, leaving a little village on our right, in about two hours reached Kefar Hane. Every house here has at least one side composed of a projecting frag ment of rock ; the terraces became now less fre quent, and the mulberry was displaced by the vine. The vines are planted on the walls and propped up so that the land betAveen is available for culture ; a most excellent plan, as the vine takes very little from the soil and its foliage is here a protection for the fields. About an hour from Kefar Hane as I Avas as cending the last ridge of the Lebanon to the south, from Avhich I expected to gain a sight of Galilee, I was surprised by the appearance of a party of horse"], [246, "232 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. and foot coming over the hill to the right, and racing through a field as if playing at jerreed. I stopped to observe their movements ; one of them galloped towards me and I soon recognised a groom of Emin Effendi, who told nie that his master was at a village close by, and that this was a party of the Messaa. On reaching the summit I beheld the lake of Ti berias or of Galilee, which appeared like a thin cloud suspended over a valley not more than 15 miles distant : it is 30.

Above the horses roosted the cocks ; both combined to make me pass Avhat the French call a white, but what I should call a black, night. The people of the hut had no kind of vessel out of Avhich I could get a drink of milk ; their food is olives and cakes, the latter earthy as also the olives ; ten olives is the rations for a full grown man, yet on this diet they live to an extraordinary age.

As regards the picturesque, the square form Avould be a great loss, and it Avould also be a great loss to the people who use the roofs in summer to sleep on, and for various domestic purposes ; besides it is the only place belonging or adjoining to their habitations Avhich is clean. They have lime in abundance and might have, not at a cost but at a great saving, admirable terraces. For becoming acquainted Avith the state of the country, a year's experience would not equal that of one day during the progress of the Messaa. It lays bare at every turn character and circumstances, tenure of property, construction of laws, application of usages. Every hour the reports come in. We have a succession of pictures and maps of the people aud country brought before us."], [250, "236 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. When, three months ago, I landed on the coast, I heard strange rumours amongst the Europeans of the Census that it was proposed to take, and which was spoken of with indignation and anger ; the object being, as every one agreed in telling me, to reduce the mountains to the same condition as the plains, by imposing new taxes, and subjecting* the Lebanon to conscription. When I arrived at Deir el Cammar, I naturally questioned my host, the principal man of the place, and he told me that it was impossible to hear at Beyrout anything but lies. That Avhat the Porte was noAV about to do, and to do in spite of the Consuls, was at the request of the whole people assembled in council. They wanted to have a scale for the raising* of the taxes, to prevent oppression and injustice on the part of the Mucatajis. On my expressing astonishment, and perhaps incredulity, he brought friends and neighbours to testify the same thing ; and since then I have had reason to estimate the intelligence of the people of Deir el Cammar, as greatly above that of the rest of the country. A contradiction so direct in places so near to one another, and in regard to a passing event about which the Avhole country was excited, was very surprising, and at the time incomprehensible. A few days later I removed to the palace of Ibtedeen, where I found myself in the very centre of the operation ; that is to say, I was there during the period that preceded the commence ment, and Avas myself a witness to that commence-"], [251, "THE MESSAA. 237 ment. It began by an experimental essay. A certain number of terraces, and a certain amount of land Avas marked off, and Bulucks or juries were appointed to rate the produce, Avhether of silk, olives, or tilled land. This they reduced to Dirhems or Drachmas ; the process was simple to them, but very complex and unintelligible to us. They told us that the method was introduced under Selim L> Avhich means nothing* more, than that it was em ployed Avhen their first tribute was paid. But to find applied to land and to produce, the terms Avhich belong* to weights and measures, carries us back not only beyond the times of Selim, but beyond the times of Greece and Ph\u0153nicia, and places us in face of usages as existing to-day, more ancient than are to be found not only in Europe, but elsewhere in Asia. I saw Avith my own eyes the Avork done, not by the agents of the Porte, but by the people themselves, and that according to a method which the Turks did not understand ; Emin Effendi, Sadie Pasha, and Sali Effendi, sat by as I did, looking* on, endeavouring to comprehend, and getting only a glimmering of what they were about toAvards the close of the day. This occurred on the 21st of No vember. The experiment was repeated on the two subsequent days, and it was then that Ave all pro- ceeded to Muchtara, to begin with Said Bey as I have narrated ; which commencement suggested to me the keeping of this Diary, Avhich was intended to be the Diary of the Messaa."], [252, "238 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. The experiment at Deir el Cammar bore on the ability to value ; the work now consists in honesty in reporting. Emin Effendi, finding it impossible to make them work by themselves, or to trust to their reports, and being unable to attend himself everywhere, had bethought himself of sending a man of his own Avith each Buluck, and has employed four engineer officers, who Avere sent to him under a misapprehension of the word Messaa. He has found amongst persons who Avould least be suspected of qualifications for such a Avork, remarkable intelli gence, and has animated them all with his own spirit. He lectures them on the difficulties and the greatness of the enterprise, the valuelessness and even the evil of their register Avhen completed, if not correct, and its lasting* service to the country if conducted Avith intelligence and capacity.

The members of the Bu lucks are arraigned, iioav for sitting in one place to eat, when they had to write in another ; now for favouring this chief, noAv that, in their valuation. In the latter case new juries are empanelled, and sent to value afresh. A property of Said Bey, which one Buluck had returned at three dirhems, has been returned by a revising Buluck at eight. Each Buluck is composed of six ; two secretaries, two appraisers and two overseers, chosen by them selves. This constitution is faulty. Two secretaries,"], [253, "239 THE MESSAA. who have merely to make the lists of the property are useless, and besides men fitted for the office are not to be found. Tavo appraisers do not suffice ; for in case of difference there is no one to decide. Two overseers are useless, for Emin Effendi is the overseer, and he should appoint the Nazir, Avho has only to see that the duty is done. Then the regulation that requires all these to belong to different religions, further embarrasses the operation and in reality affords no security, but the reverse ; because the very jealousy which prompts it facilitates foul play. It would therefore be desirable to do away with the Nazirs, leaving them to be appointed by the Com missioner of the Porte, and with one of the secre taries ; and to increase the appraisers to three or five. An oath is administered to them in Avhich the Avords Koran, etc. vary according to their faith, and they are subject to severe penalties in case of false returns. If the above alterations are adopted ; if the power of the Commissioners be increased and Emin Effendi continued, or a man of the same character put in his place, the work may go on ; otherwise its comple tion as Avell as its accuracy, appear to me very pro blematical. The Messaa will be equivalent to a general register. In every case of contested property each claimant seeks to have himself placed on the record as in pos session ; so that a mistake in the entry of a name may not only decide a long pending suit, but sud denly a man's property which no one disputed may"], [254, "240 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. pass to another. A remarkable case occurred to day- A peasant came to complain that he had learned that instead of his name that of Said Bey had been entered as proprietor of his land. He declared that he Avas in possession, that his right no one had ever contested, and that the only question with Said Bey was, his refusal to sell the land to him. The register on examination was found originally to have borne this peasant's name, which had been erased to make way for that of Said Bey. This last had been done by the Druze Kiatib Avho had no business to inter fere, as the peasant was a Christian. On being summoned he produced an order from the agent of Said Bey, but written by himself, requiring* him to substitute the Bey's name. The Christian Kiatib, sent for to explain hoAV he had concurred in this false return, excused himself by saying that the Druze Kiatib had frightened him. The Vakil of Said Bey, who is in attendance on Emin Effendi, was then called, and offered in explanation that Said Bey had bought one half of a parcel of ground of which the land in question was the half, and that he had the right to displace the possessor of the other half by paying him the value. Emin Effendi determined to examine the case on the spot, and ordered the horses. The Vakil declared the distance to be five hours ; twenty of those present had been there, and with one voice declared it to be distant but a hour and a half. After dispatching in other directions two"], [255, "241 THE MESSAA. other Bulucks Avhich had just come in, rating them soundly, and settling that henceforth they should be paid and fed according to the work done, Emin Effendi Avith Sali Effendi and some officers mounted and departed. This village has thus relapsed from bustle into its tranquil existence. I am seated under the shade of the moving leaves of the mulberry tree, which do not protect me from the heat of a Decem ber sun at 3000 feet above the sea. Either the Commissioner of the Porte Avill become, through this incident, the instrument of Said Bey, or he will put it out of his power to cross him fur ther ; he Avill relieve the people from the fear under Avhich they at present labour, and Avhich makes them hold their tongue. This subserviency is natural ; they have no muni cipal Government to fall back on. The religious dissensions have broken all cohesion. It is an error to suppose that there are distinct people of Maro nites, Druzes, &c. The six classes are everywhere located together, and however small the minority it serves to prevent local union ; because in proportion to its weakness is its dependence upon the chief from Avhose vexations it suffers, in common with the majo rity. It may be imagined that a plan maturely consi dered and formally proposed by their OAvn assembled deputies, by Avhich the sum of their respective im posts should be fixed, and by which collaterally the title of each man to his property should be estab- R"], [256, "242 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. lished (for no man borne on the register can be dis placed save by a judicial decision) would noAv relieve them from their fears. But to them the future is clouded and the present indistinct. Ideas of organic change, which so utterly incapacitate a people for the management of their affairs, are floating in their minds; \u2014 Said Bey to be put up \u2014 Emir Beshir restored \u2014 England to occupy, or France to rule through a Maronite. Besides the people are so ignorant as not to be aAvare that the census has been requested by themselves. The night that I slept at Niha the chiefs of the village came to pay me a visit. After some general conversation they asked me what I thought of the Messaa. I ansAvered that it was rather for me to ask them. They said they did not know, and therefore they had asked me. I was surprised, and ansAvered, that it was their own plan, which they denied. I then recounted the cir cumstances of the assembly at Beyrout ; they did not desist from their denial of it till I told them that I had myself read the report made to the Porte, and had with my own eyes seen the beginning of the operation in most strict conformity Avith rules laid down in that report. Had I been a Beyrout Con sul or Dragoman, or their agent, I might have'ex asperated the Avhole population by a single word \u25a0 and so of every other district. But I was wrong in saying that the change in these people occurred on my bearing testimony to the abovementioned facts. It was after an ansAver"], [257, "THE MESSAA. 243 which I gave them. They had said, \" The evalua tion is only to put on new taxes, and the census to levy troops,\" to which I replied, \"If the Sultan Avanted to put on new taxes, Avhat need has he of the Messaa ; he has only to say to the Druzes pay so much, to the Maronites pay so much.\" The old man, who served as interpreter, was much tickled, and exclaimed, \" That is it,\" and laughed and ex claimed again, till the rest of the party lost ali patience in their anxiety to know what I had said. When he did translate the words there was a peal of concurrence. I then continued, \" As to the Nizam, if you belonged to any European Go vernment, the present opportunity of your divisions and Aveakness would be taken to draft away all the arm-bearing men, and possibly to colonize you, and fill your place with peaceable persons; could you for a moment resist such an order, and can you deny that you deserve it?\" They were silent. \" Truly,\" said an old man, after a pause, \" our hard hands made these ruins. May the Sultan live !\" But for this ignorance and these animosities, the authority of the Porte would be, in this region, sur rounded by a prestige which it wanted in regard to the destruction of the other corporations which defied its authority and fell beneath its power. In this case it has had neither to smite, to confiscate, to tax, or to impose conscription. In the other cases, no foreign hand appeared, and in this lies the difference of the results. R 2"], [258, "244 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. There is perhaps no country in the world which, by the rapidity of deterioration, has brought into such close proximity the extremes of the human condition. The Lebanon brings down to yesterday if not the heroic, at least the patriarchal ages, whilst it offers toview this day, an antithesis to these, such as has not even yet been attained to in the States of Europe. The public business, tAvo generations back, was conducted in open assemblies, to which no one had right of admittance by written law, but from Avhich, by custom, the humblest peasant could not be ex- cluded. His voice, Avhen there, was equal to that of any Sheik ; no tax could be otherwise imposed than by general consent, no Avar levied, no alliance formed, and no innovation practicable, by the mere Avill of the Emir. Habit Avas law, until a decision established a neAv one.

Volney dwells with surprise and delight, on the discourse of the children often years of age, avIio discussed the interests of Daher and Jezzar, kneAV the number of muskets in this or that camp, the motive of this or that quarrel, and decided on the value of this or that alliance.

The Sheiks and the Emirs have no privilege in this respect, and they may be said to contribute to the public burdens in proportion to their fortune. The collection is made almost without cost ; it is at the option of the people to bring it to Deir el Cammar, or the collectors of the Prince travel the country, to receive it after the respective harvests.\" I had declined to accompany Emin Effendi, that I might use the interval of quiet in recording, not the immediate occurrences, but the epoch to Avhich they belong. I feel as if about to leave by Avill a possession to the future historian. From the close of the great European war, that quarter of the globe presents a series of convulsions, gradually increasing* in frequency and in intensity ; each movement of the masses grinding doAvn institu tions and breaking up the barriers of states. Each losing in the concentration and secrecy of govern ment its cohesion and identity, until the distinction between war and peace has been effaced, and thereby the social bond dissolved. During the same period, the Ottoman empire, which was in the last stage of decrepitude, has ex hibited a change no less astounding, but wholly different. It has, by a violent effort, thrown off the organizations which, springing up by usurpation, had absorbed into themselves the vital powers, and in doing so has regained the force requisite for"], [261, "247 THE MESSAA. external protection. The Janissaries and the Dere beys being* extinguished, were made to contribute fro\"m their elements a regular army, and the resources to support the neAV charge. The central Government then proceeded to a re-conquest of the Empire, subject ing successively the independent tribes from Albania to Curdistan, and the rebellious Pashas from Scodra to Bagdad, to the neAV military organization ; with out interfering othenvise Avith habits, or giving rise to political differences. The result has been a magnificent army and a revenue, amounting this year to more than double what it Avas in 1833; Avith the faculty of being more than doubled again by a very simple process. This regeneration, for which there is no parallel in ancient or modern times, has been effected in a single generation, and in face of the most alarming external difficulties. The seal is put on this achievement by the events following the Hungarian Avar, when Austria and Russia combined, and in a secret understanding* Avith England and France, threatened Turkey with Avar unless she sur rendered the refugees ; and being met by a refusal, submitted to withdraw their demands. In a fair contest of arms, the whole military force of Russia and Austria united, could now make no impression on the Ottoman Empire. But the extirpation of Janissaries and Derebeys, the creation of an army, the restoration of a navy, the replenishing of the treasury, will not realize even so much as the security of the Empire, unless"], [262, "248 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. the Sheiks of the Lebanon be put down. This is the reason : the recurrence of a struggle between England and France on the soil of Turkey, woirld not now end as on the last occasion, and would be far more dangerous than would be a conjoint inva sion by these two powers. This contingency is always possible, and ultimately certain, whilst the Lebanon presents its present elements of discord. These elements have, moreover, been artificially produced, and produced Avith a view to this result. In 1798, the contest between England and France was a sincere one. Russia had indeed in volved them in the quarrel, but the war was carried on by them both in perfect sincerity ; England haA'ing prevailed, restored to the Porte her pro vinces. The constitutions of England and France have since then undergone a complete change ; sincerity between either can no longer be looked for any more in war than in peace, in operations con ducted by guns than in operations conducted by despatches. Out of the insincerity of the Govern ments, a sincere animosity Avill nevertheless spring up between the nations. It will begin religiously, and end politically ; it will begin, reversing the events of 1798, with the Lebanon, and end Avith -Egypt? will begin, as the case may be, Avith protecting the Druzes against the Maronites and the French, or with a common protection of the Christians against the Mussulmans. It will end in"], [263, "THE MESSAA. 249 a contest for India on the soil of Egypt. That country has been the apple of discord prepared for both by Russia since 1780, and which she has now involved both countries in the desire of possessing. Did not Egypt begin the great war between Eng land and France ? Was not Syria used in 1840 for the breaking the great French and English alliance ? Even history can here foreshadow her oavii future course. The thing Avill be done by their agents, whilst the nations know nothing* about it. They will only hear of it when the measures have been taken, and their passions aroused. Besides, another condition has physically been Avorked out, both for England and France ; viz. that both have been rendered perfectly defenceless against attack. At any moment, not only they, but the German PoAvers also, can be smitten with panic. This you have seen as regards France in 1840. Every Government, therefore, must live every day in the internal conviction that it exists on sufferance, and that Russia can smite it the hour she pleases Avith a coalition of foreign Powers. These, then, are the grounds on which I hold the enterprise we are engaged in, trifling as it appears, to affect the future destiny of the v> hole human race.

Its triumph will have been ensured by concert between its people and itself against the stranger. It will take courage to give an answer back to the Ambassador at Con stantinople. The moment it can do so, it is in a state to retrieve itself entirely ; for it can then say to the Russian Minister, \"Your army must be withdrawn from Wallachia and Moldavia ;\" and to the people of the Lebanon, \" Now elect a Prince for your ruler according* to the precedent of 1694, and as has been done the other day by the people of Servia.\"* It may appear inconceivable or incredible that the case should revolve on the pivot Avhich I here indi cate. Nevertheless it is so. The Turkish Govern ment has courage enough to defy not only one, * It was in consequence of the so-far successful progress of the Messaa, that instead of returning to England from Beyrout, I pro ceeded to Constantinople, with a view to the purposes indicated in the text. Although the Porte did for the moment entertain the idea of an election for the Lebanon, the plan ultimately failed, in consequence of what had been done in the meantime in the Lebanon. I succeeded, however, in respect to the withdrawal of the Russian army from the provinces of the Danube, and also in reference to the financial restoration ; which, coming into general operation after an experimental essay in Europe and in Asia, increased the direct taxes 30 per cent, in the course of the year 1852. All this was of course broken down subsequently.

For, if a stranger in Turkey can do, being hostilely disposed, so much more injury than in any other country ; it is clear that one differently minded can effect much in the opposite sense. The investigating party has returned in high spirits. The peasant was found, the land examined ; he was in possession of documents in perfect order. On which Emin Effendi displaced the secretary, and told him that it was only in consideration of this being the first offence that had been committed, that he did not send him to the gallies. The other per son compromised made his escape, to Said Bey ! At the close of the investigation the village, which had assembled, burst out in cries of \" Long live the Sultan.\" There is not a village in which Said Bey has not some property, however worthless, and scarcely a peasant a portion of whose land he has not entered on. His is a remarkable system, aiming at complete domination as to authority, and possession as to pro perty. It explains how the property of his father was acquired. They have a curious method of dis tributing the property in parts. The whole is con sidered one Dirhem, Avhich is divided into 24 carats. Thus a man does not till an acre of land, but 5 or 6 carats, Avhich may mean only a fraction of the one carat, held by a larger proprietor. In the same manner the Avhole Mountain is considered as a unit"], [267, "THE MESSAA. 253 Avhich is divided into 24 parts, which are the 24 mu catas. In the course of the evening a certificate came from a neighbouring village, with the seals of the principal inhabitants, declaring that they had sheAvn field by field their possessions, and declared man by man their people from seventeen to sixty to the Buluck, that they had seen their evaluation, and that it was correct, that they bound themselves for its truth, and Avere ready to incur any penalty if proved false. Soon afterwards a troop of Metuali came up, re claiming* the Messaa for their district.

He told him that it Avas very unfortunate that the name of Said Bey should have been brought up in respect to so trifling an affair ; that if he had dealt Avith the matter as at first he intended, and sent it before the tribunal of the Pashalic, his master might have been greatly in jured ; but he Avas sure he had been imposed upon"], [268, "254 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. by his agents, or that his agents had acted without his authority. But he begged him to take notice that it Avas the Bey who Avas really responsible for his agents, and if anything of the like occurred again he should not pass it over so lightly. A murmur of applause having folloAved these words, he turned round to the people and told them, that it was the misfortune of great men to be exposed to misrepre sentations as Avell as to be deceived by servants ; that for his part he looked neither to a man because he Avas rich or poor, and cared as little for the favour of the one as the frown of the other, and then narrated to them an incident which had occurred to himself at Beyrout. He had purchased Avith his oavii money a piece of ground for a school, which was in process of erection, when he learnt that he was accused of having robbed a man of his property, and of turning it to his own account. He immediately caused the building to be stopped, and required the person in question to prefer his claims before the council, from Avhich being president he absented himself. So, he added, Said Bey may have been unjustly accused, and in like manner ready as soon as he learns the facts to clear himself. The Vakil came forward, and in token of gratitude kissed the hem of his garment.

Observing* some geological specimens Avhich I had thrown away, he gathered up a few, saying he would give them to Emin Pasha. Scarcely had Ave started when he began to expatiate on the oppressions of the peasantry and"], [271, "A TURKISH OFFICER ON WAR. 257 the villany of the Sheiks ; knew everything about the Messaa ; was learned in dirhems and carats ; pointed out the defects of the plan, and how they Avere to be remedied. I had Avith my own ears heard him extract his Avhole rubbish in about two minutes from the administrative groom of Emin Effendi ; yet it Avas not bad rubbish in its Avay. He soon discovered that Newcastle Avas not his market for coals, and passed to military matters. I found myself riding beside one of the few Avho had escaped from the destruction of Mustafa Pasha's army on the shores of the gulf of Lepanto. He described the scene, Avhich I knew Avell, having seen there the Avhite bones of the Turks. He said the Greeks did not destroy Mustafa Pasha. Had his army been Avhat any army ought to be, he Avould have inarched through every corner of the Morea, ex cept Maina, in three months, and subjugated it Avith out a contest : Maina might have been left, as here tofore, to its Bey. The' Turkish troops had then become dangerous only to themselves. He had served afterwards with Reschid Mehemet Pasha in Greece, Albania, Curdistan, and Syria, and he had a feAV characteristic Avords to say of each campaign. Suddenly stopping*, he asked me Avhat news there was of the Majar Madessi, meaning the Hungarian refuo*ees. I ansAvered that it Avas settled ; on Avhich he reined up his charger, and, Avinking one eye, said, \" I knew that.\" You learned it then at Da mascus? \" Oh no, I knew from the commencement s"], [272, "258 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. that it Avas all bosh ;\" but I said, did not the Austrian aud Russian Governments demand the refugees, did not the Sultan refuse them ? Could these Powers withdraw, or the Sultan yield ? Did not the Am bassadors threaten to leave, &c? \" Oh yes, but it was all bosh.\" How is that ? \" I will tell you\u2014 but here is a fountain which has been much commended to me ; I am not thirsty, but may be, when no such water is to be found ; \" and so he leapt to the ground, received a large flat silver boAvl which his servant carried in a leather case strung over his shoulder, and, after drinking a copious draught, brought me one, urging me to drink on his grounds, as if I had been a camel. Divested now of his outer mantle, and in his military surtout with cartouch box on its breast, despatch satchel, and sabre strapped crossways over the shoulders, with Frank boots coming up to the knee, and an oriental rich ness mixing* Avith the occidental forms, he brought to my mind the red-cross knights, many of whom had dismounted on the same spot and satisfied, or like him anticipated, their thirst at the same foun tain. We had taken a peasant for a guide through the pass, and were here to dismiss him. So my companion made a complex sign, which to me was intended to signify, \"the gentleman calls you,\" and to him, \" my secretary will pay you.\" The man came to me for his bakshish, and then returned to the knight to kiss hands. He covered the operation by"], [273, "A TURKISH OFFICER ON WAR. 259 the aside \u2014 \" Sad devils these Metuali ; they are our Roman Catholics.\" We had now to descend a steep gorge of piled fragments of rock matted with prickly oak. Our horses' bridles Avere throAvn to the servants, and we leisurely commenced our descent on foot, an opera tion to Avhich my companion seemed as little used as suited. His breath was not, hoAvever, affected, so he commenced his promised reply, and part of it Avas shouted at the distance of twenty yards, when we chanced to be separated so far. I shall try to give it as nearly as possible in his own words. \" War Avas Avhat was meant when they talked of the Major Madessi. War is not the business of the Kiatibs (diplomatists), but of soldiers. So then I knew more about it than all the Kiatibs of Con stantinople and London. I knew it Avas all bosh, because the Muscovites are not fools ; they reckon hundreds of thousands as Ave count tens, but they are very weak ; and they are so because their soldiers are treated Avorse than dogs : if you did give wages to a dog would they only be tAvo piastres (4f/.) a-year ?\" Here 1 ventured an observation to the effect that the Russian troops had above 5s. a-year, and when across the frontier, 15.s. He resumed, \" Don't speak ! I know what I knoAv \u2014 I speak their language.

When they Avere taken prisoners, ah, we wanted no guards over them, the pilaff and the chorba were their guards ! Noav, I will tell you Avhat the Muscovites have. Every three months they receive 7^ piastres, Avhich makes 30 in the year ; of this 3\u00a3 is retained for the hospital and 3^- for the priest, so that there remains exactly 20 paras (Id) per three months to spend, which comes to 2 piastres in the year. They get to eat (besides Moavs) black bread of rye, Avhich would kill a Turk in a week ; twice a week they have a handful of corn just as might be served out to an ass. Of course when these men heard that ours had 20 piastres a month, which makes 240 in the year instead of 2, with not a para kept back, and that we had soup and meat and pilaff every day, they wished they had been born elseAvhere and not in Muscovy. I dont blame them. But that makes a great difference, when we come to speak of Avar; for how shall the Muscovite Czar make Avar with us till he pays and feeds his men better ?\" Here I again ventured to interfere, and alluded to such events having occurred, and being followed by certain others. - But I was silenced by shouts and violent gesticulations : he turned, being before, marched up to me, and squatted down. I feared a blood-vessel had burst, but soon perceived that his"], [275, "A TURKISH OFFICER ON WAR. 261 health was unimpaired ; so sitting doAAn opposite to him, I addressed myself to listen. \"You send 12 tambours (regiments) against 150. Do you call that war ? What war can 12 tam bours make against 150? I Avas there (referring to 1828) and AAe Avere 12 tambours, and the Russians had 150 ; but Ave did not run away. We said, \" we are sold,\" but Ave did not run away. And Avhat were these 12 tambours ? Were they like those Ave have novv? And Avhat Avere our officers? Were they like those Ave have now ?

He answered, a No, they all thought we were to have Avar, when those on leave of absence were recalled.\" I asked if they agreed with him as to the chances of a struggle. He answered \" Kulli, kulli,\" all, all ; but then added \u2014 \"if avo were Avell com manded.\" Then you do apprehend that the superior officers are not equal to the task. \" No, I do not say that, but as in a game of chess, the men must be properly played.

I did not leave my companion, Avhich I did as soon as Ave reached more level ground, without let ing him knoAv that my questions and objections had not been prompted by scepticism, but on the contrary to assure myself that he had real grounds for what he said. The very appearance of the man changed, and from coarse and bluff, became earnest and almost gentlemanlike, as I proceeded to tell him, that before Turkey had an army I had been as satisfied of her power of recovery as of my own existence ; and then dilated on the peculiar soldier character of the Turks, from their sobriety, cleanliness, sense of self-respect, familiarity with the use of arms, absence of speculative notions, freedom from in tolerance, observance of their religion, and capa bility of unrepining endurance. He Avas perfectly amazed when I told him that the Turkish soldier was better paid than the English soldier, and that the Turkish army vvas able to bring into the field a larger amount of men than Russia and Austria united could bring to bear on any point where a contest could take place between them. He pulled out his tablets to take doAvn, that he might read them to his comrades, some expressions I used. One -was, \" The Turks noAv will beat the Russians whenever they meet them in fair fights, the latter not exceeding double the former.\" Whilst I resided at Ibtedeen, I was in the habit of paying visits to the common soldiers. Whenever I entered a barrack-room they stood up, and"], [277, "A TURKISH OFFICER ON AVAR. 263 arranged themselves, so that the apartment assumed the air of the reception hall of a Vizir. I Avas placed in the corner, and they all stood in a row, whilst the service of coffee was gone through. The pipes and coffee cups were indeed homely, but the style and dignity were there. This done, I invited them to be seated, and the divans round Avere then occupied as if by grandees. The conversation was the same, just as were the forms. Well might Napoleon say, that with such men he could conquer the Avorld. The danger in the new organization was that the empire would become too military. This has been obviated by rendering the different Ordus (hordes), or divisions \u2014 camps ; not armies ; fixing* each to its province, preserving* in the different corps the geographic order of the district from which it is recruited, so that each corporal's guard is sup- plied from its OAvn village. Thus is the army like a tree planted in the ground ; whilst by its shadow protecting the land, it holds in each fibre of its roots to its own soil. It is thus constituted an army for defence, not for oppression. The liberties of Europe have been shipwrecked on the non-solution of this equation. Note on the Turkish Army, appended 1S60. At the time of this conversation I Avas not of course aware of the opinion of General Aupic (then French am bassador at Constantinople), nor of that of General Bern, who has expressed himself in terms almost identical. Nor"], [278, "264 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. had the positive evidence been furnished by the events of the war of 1853. I may now recall, that before the opening of that campaign I had made this announcement: \" The Turks will beat the Russians whenever they have an opportunity of meeting them.\" I added, three months later, \" Whenever the Allies appear on the field with the Turks \u2014 the Turks will be beaten.\" I conceive it to be im portant to recall these prejudgments, because it is the habit to-day to take for reality the appearances that are presented ; or rather to take the words that are printed in lieu of the events that occur. In proof of the authenti city of the above, and of the words not having been whis pered in a corner, I subjoin extracts from the Times. Before Turkey had declared war against Russia. \" We must oppose the aggrandisement of Russia, and so long as this is the only alternative, we must maintain the integrity of the Ottoman Empire ; but of this we may be sure \u2014 that while a tumbledown Turkish Empire lies at the feet of a powerful military monarchy, and our only method of curbing the latter is by ' maintaining ' the for mer, we shall never enjoy much respite from troubles like the present.\"\u2014 Times, Sep. 28, 1853.

Mr. Urquhart may then claim such triumph for political foresight, as never before fell to the lot of man ; but such will be the general satisfaction of Europe at the result, that nobody, we think we may promise him, will be at all likely to repine at his exclusive credit.\" \u2014 Times, Nov. 11, 1853. After the Russian discomfiture before Silistria. \" Swift and terrible has been the retribution which has fallen on the Russian army engaged in this shameful and unprovoked aggression, and the chastisement is rendered the more humiliating to the pride of the Czar, and the more important to the political independence of the Porte, by the fact that a division of the Turkish army, unassisted by European troops, has sufficed to repel the invader, with unexampled losses. These glorious results belong to the Turkish arms exclusively, and the soldiers of the Sultan never fought with more devoted and successful bravery than on this occasion.\" \u2014 Times, June 22, 1854. The prediction here referred to was no symptom of courage, for the case presented no shade of ambiguity. Had the Turks not been able to defend themselves, they would have been left to themselves. The Allies went, as Lord Ponsonby puts it, \" to defend not Turkey but Russia.\" I had besides the judgment of Russia herself to assist me. In the despatch of Pozzo di Borgo, of Nov. 1S28, the conviction of the Russian Cabinet is distinctly stated : \u2014 \" The experience we have just made must now reunite all opinions in favour of the resolution which has been adopted, (i. e. to make war against the Porte,) the Emperor"], [280, "266 DIARY IN \"THE LEBANON, has put the Turkish system to the proof, and his Majesty has found it to possess a commencement of physical and moral organization which it hitherto had not. \" If the Sultan has been enabled to offer us a deter mined and regular resistance, whilst he had scarcely assembled together the elements of his new plan of reform and ameliorations, how formidable should we have found him, had he had time to give it more solidity, and to ren der that barrier impenetrable which we find so much diffi culty in surmounting, although art has hitherto done so little to assist nature. \" We must congratulate ourselves upon having attacked them before they became more dangerous for us, for delay would only have rendered our situation worse.\" And again : \u2014 \" After the campaign has afforded it (the Russian Ca binet) a more correct estimate of the real state of things, and has convinced it of the necessity of multiplying pre cautions, in order to diminish the dangers of the future.\" \u2014 Portfolio, vol. i. pp. 348-351. The military success of Russia in 1829, and the diplo matic success of the Treaty of Adrianople in the same year, did not \" diminish \" for Russia \" the dangers of the future,\" however it may have disguised them from Europe. I, at least, was under no such delusion. In a letter written the morning after the fete on board \" the Blonde \" to commemorate the peace, I stated, with a simplicity of conviction which on now finding it after an interval of so many years, fills me with amazement, that the blow which had fallen, not having crushed the Empire, would reno vate it. But I did not content myself with the reflection ; the perception opened to me a career ; I resolved to work for that end \u2022 to make it my business to break Russia by the renovation of Turkey, just as others make it their"], [281, "NOTE ON THE TURKISH ARMY. 267 business to build a house or to train a horse. A man may make, as well as choose, a profession for himself. And if this was the business of a Government, and Governments shrunk from it, it remained to be undertaken by a man. After all it was an operation contingent on thought, and not on armies. In the operation itself there was no dif ficulty whatever ; the obstruction arose solely from being interfered with by those in whose behalf I was engaged. From that hour the military, administrative, and finan cial organization advanced. Checked, endangered, re tarded, it is true, and filling those who had the work at heart always with disquietude, often with dismay,* but fur nishing in these very feelings, sources of perseverance and elements of success. At last the achievement was sealed under the walls of Silistria, and the security of the Empire placed beyond all possibility of attack by foe, or cavil by friend. What happened thereafter, matters not. If Turkey Avere to be shivered to pieces to-morrow, that cannot pre vent this reconstruction from having been foreseen and effected. It was one thing that the military power of Turkey should be restored as against the arms of Russia; it is another that that restoration should hold against the friendship of England. Let Turkey now fall when she may, and as she well deserves, and the words of Mr. Sydney Herbert will still remain my justification \u2014 \" We (the English and French Governments) were agreed with or enemy, but not with our ally.\" * In one of these moments, so far back as 183G, Lord Ponsonby concludes a letter to me in these words \u2014 But we live !"], [282, "268 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. CHAPTER V. THE METROPOLIS OF PH\u0152NICIA. The valley or gorge which we had descended gave us a distant glimpse of the sea ; when we got to the bottom we came upon an ancient road about six feet Avide, chiselled through the rock, and just Avide enough for a laden camel to pass; it was nar rower beloAv. The falling thus unexpectedly upon this track of the camels of Dedan, finding their way to the Ph\u0153nician outlets, or the Mediterranean, recalled me from present men and events, and brought before me the people, whose metropolis I was so soon to behold the remnants of, or at least the site. We emerged from the chain of the Lebanon near the village of Giurgova, and then beheld spread be fore us, from Tyre on the left to the cape of Beyrout on the right, the Ph\u0153nician plains. The city of Sidon was hid, but the spot where it stood Avas pointed out. It is not however a plain, but the summits of the loAver ranges, which appear ; and they concealed, at least in the part before us, the level strip bordering* the sea. After a descent of about an hour the country became less rugged, the hills Avere composed of masses of pale soil and calcareous earth, and a gentle canter of two hours brought me to Saida."], [283, "THE METROPOLIS OF PH\u0152NICIA. 269 The strip of land close to it loses the ashy aspect and loose nature of the rest of the country, and be comes black, greasy mould, such as in the richest parts of Hungary and Roumelia ; gardens surround the town, but not so much on the south whence I was approaching; on that side it Avas marked by a mamelon croAvned Avith a small castle. I did not enter by the gate, for having outstripped my compa nions, I turned to the north, Avhere the gardens lay thick and luxuriant. The vieAV of the city where I turned off is most lively and exhilarating*. The wall Avith its turrets has been converted into houses, and fitted with AvindoAvs ; the ditch in front has been filled up and divided off into gardens. The road en circles these, and on the right of it is a wall which holds up the burying ground, but of which you have the command as you sit on horseback. It is shaded over and almost covered in by platani ; the tombs are not the ordinary turbes of the Turks, but the very sac-simile of the tombs of Lycia, with which Englishmen are noAv familiar from the collection of them in the first room of the British Museum. The figure is that of the section of a boat turned upside down, and having a very deep keel. Groups of women in their Avhite veils, were seated or sauntering. The scene Avas circumscribed, but smiling and eastern, I may even say tropical and primeval ; the waving leaves of the banana and the Lycian forms, transported me to both simultaneously. The oardens to the north of the town are someAvhat"], [284, "270 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. in the style of Morocco ; there is not the aloe, but there are the Barbary fig and the tall cane ; and if inferior in luxuriance, the orange trees were there bent under their shining load. Some stray grapes were still hanging* on the vines. The orange and the vine fill up the year, the fruit of each being ripe through every month in which that of the other is wanting. There Avas one plant of wonderful vege tation, the lentiscus ; the stems were of the dimen sions and the appearance of the gnarled oak, but the top Avas not in proportion. The branches seemed the growth of latter times, on trunks so ancient that the plants may have been set in the ground by the first colonists of Sidon. Entering the town alone, I Avandered through it till I perceived through a narrow lane leading doAvn to the Avater, tAvo or three tiers of gigantic blocks ; this was a fragment of the Avail which enclosed the port. I then traced the continuation of the mole, partly by a scarped reef, partly by masonry. Not being aAvare \" that stone upon stone\" did remain of Sidon, this Avas a surprise, and I promised myself no ordinary gratification in prowling around each nook and crevice. I was directed to the \" French Khan,\" where I Avas told I should find consuls, conack, and supper. This building is a large square, surrounded AAith porticoes, as in Spain.

I AA'as shewn into one of its vaults spread Avith mats and boarded Avith quilts. I expected a \" locanda,\" a miserable gouty place, with chairs and tables as at Beyrout, and Avas agreeably disappointed. Having the French Consul for a neighbour, I paid him a visit. His Avife, a pretty person, a native, seated in a similar vault, received me. A AvindoAV opened on the port, and the vault formed a remarkably sprightly apartment. The lady's costume was that of the country ; through it predominated the pale straw colour of the silk gauze, and bright yellow of the tags and fringes of gold. The Syrian Avomen Avear the breast open, almost down to the girdle, though the dress comes up to the neck ; and as much shocked as our ladies Avould be at the exposure of bosoms,so would they be at the exposure of shoulders. She was sitting on the divan suckling her child, Avhile smoking* her nargille ; she spoke French very well, and Avas her husband's Arabic secretary. Pre- sently her husband came in, received me with the extremest kindness, and offered me the hospitality of his roof. Finding that I had come from the Lebanon, he inquired Avith much interest into the progress of the Messaa. I found him however already informed of every particular, even to the circumstances of yes terday. It Avas alarming to witness this facility of communication, and the hold of the foreign agents. He told me that it was Avith the French Consul at Beyrout that the project had originated five years before. Passing* through Constantinople, he had"], [286, "272 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. been consulted by Redschid Pasha. Mr. Bure (?) considering that the protection of France, which for merly had been exerted to shield the Maronite po pulation from the vexation of the Druze chiefs, was noAv ineffectual, as they (the Maronites) had become the most poAverful and the oppressing body, and also injurious, as England had undertaken the counter protection of the Druzes, suggested an opposite course. He proposed two measures. The one an evaluation of the lands which should put an end to extortion, and the other the banishment of the most powerful Sheiks, whom there was no means of keep ing within bounds. He designated eight ; of these the principal was Said Bey. The English Consul, backed by the Russian, declared against the first measure, and in favour of the second ; only he in sisted on excepting Said Bey. As the expulsion of the seven Avould only have the effect of leaving* the eighth Avithout any check Avhatever, the proposal was abandoned. It was, therefore, Avith the partiality of a partizan that he observed and exulted in the progress that had been made. He said, \" They have found the man, and he has used his occasion. He has betnm where the people Avere the most oppressed, and, after dealing with the most to be apprehended of the Sheiks, he Avill have easy Avork Avith the others.\" He then told me that his predecessor in the office he held at Beyrout had by extortion amassed an immense fortune. The Porte having intelligence"], [287, "273 THE METROPOLIS OF PH\u0152NICIA. of his proceedings had him arrested. He had then offered to Emin Effendi a larg*e sum of money. He had laid the letter before the Divan. This incident brought to my mind an expression of Izzet Pasha when at Muchtara, we were walking in the woods; he broke a long silence with these words, \" In the time of my father and grandfather the presence here of the commander of the district Avould have cost Said Bey a good sum of money and a vast amount of provisions : at present it costs him nothing in money, I have but tAvo servants to feed, and it is I who make presents to his people.\" He, like the French vice-consul, was thinking on the change that Avas taking place in the character of this na tion : in such a case to begin is to have half suc ceeded. Physicians being a class combining more than any other the elements out of Avhich are formed ob servant and conversable men, it is often an advan tage to be taken ill, as offering the chance of form ing an agreeable or profitable acquaintance. This happened to me here. The physician called in was a Frenchman, formerly in the service of Ibrahim Pasha, and Avho had knoAvn Syria under both ad ministrations. The vice-consul also improved upon acquaintance ; and I had the further advantage of visits, during my confinement to the house, from Turks, Arabs and others, who all brought me profit and amusement. I Avas able the second day to get so far as the island rock and reef, which, lying* off T"], [288, "274 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. the coast at this point, have rendered it capable of being made a naval station. I gave up two days to these reefs, and spent them there alone. It Avas one day passed on the border of the Atlan tic, at Shemish, overlooking* the site of the Hesperides, and Avithin sound of the roar of the real dragon that still guards the entrance,* that decided me on visit ing, at my first moment of leisure, the parent city. It was also to the exploration of her far colonies in the west, that I OAve much of the enjoyment I noAv experienced from sitting* and musing* among* the ruins (if ruins they can be called) of Sidon herself; which, if not the metropolis, is certainly the earliest of the offshoots planted on the Mediterranean. So it became a fresh starting* point for others. Under the name (never heard by the people itself) of Ph\u0153 nicia is disguised that wonderful union of poAver and simplicity to which essentially the epithet Bar baric belonged. \" Barbaric letters,\" \"\" barbaric pomp,\" \" barbaric gold,\" meant Ph\u0153nician in each case. And what Ave have received from Greece and Rome, these received from the Barbarians ; a name which we so revere in our heart's core that every people dissimilar to ourselves Ave honour by that epithet. The polite letters and useful arts, Avhich passing through generation and generation, and spreading* from tribe to tribe, have embellished time in all its stages, aided man in all his enterprises, fed and * See description in Pillars of Hercules, vol. ii."], [289, "THE METROPOLIS OF PH\u0152NICIA. 275 clothed, enriched and polished him, sailed forth from this haven, and were distributed by those Avho chose for themselves this site. In all our great ness, in all Ave know, Ave are ourselves their monu ment. The side of the hill to the north of the town, and overlooking* the gardens, is pierced with tombs. I heard of one that had recently been laid bare by a fall of earth, in Avhich there Avere paintings and an inscription in an unknown character. I Avas con sequently all anxiety to see it, and got on horseback Avhen little able to support the fatigue. I met only with disappointment. It Avas a small cavern Avorked out into side-tombs, of which there may be a dozen, and painted in the style of a modern Greek coffee room, dabs of paint, festoons, trees, and birds on them. From the mouth of the tomb there is a charming prospect of Saida, stretching from the fort-crowned mound to the south, that shields it landward, to the embattled rock in the Avater, Avhich commands the port on the north, and is joined to the town by a bridge. The port lies betAveen this bridge and a reef which runs out from below the land fort. About a mile to the north of the mole is another reef, affording* protection against the only wind and sea here to be apprehended\u2014 the Avesterly. No- Avhere along the coast had I seen combined, cir cumstances so favourable for such a people as the Ph\u0153nicians ; giving a footing ashore, so to say, for t 2"], [290, "276 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. their ships, and a station afloat, in case of necessity, for their goods and people. In addition to this was the rich land and abundant Avater of the vicinity for gardens; the forests of Lebanon, close by, for timber, and its cedars for their enormous masts ;* while, last, not least, a climate such, that their December days surpassed the finest we could select from our July. This supposes, not a people living on the coast that went to sea, but a sea-faring* people who, coming from afar, looked out for a convenient sta tion. The port now, by the rising of the sand, affords entrance only to craft drawing from four to five feet. The present town stands partly on what must formerly haAre been the port. There were three entrances ; one is still perfect, and is like that of a dock, through Avhich a vessel of 500 tons could pass. The reef, which forms the wall seaAvard, has been joined to the land by a breakwater at right angles. The reef, Avhere it loAvers, is built upon by a Avail ten feet thick, composed of stones, some of which must Aveigh 50 tons. They are limestone, but not of that which is found in the neighbour hood. Three tiers still stand on the north-west angle. This wall was for defence, as appears from the height and from the double gateway cut in the rock ; the grooves of the portcullis, and the mor tices for the bar which secured the door within are * See Lucian's description of them."], [291, "THE METROPOLIS OF PH\u0152NICIA. 277 still perfect. The rock without has been cut level into a broad landing place. In some places mortar filled with pottery is largely used, and is more durable than most of the stones its binds ; a large fragment of it is built as a stone into the doorway of the modern city. These stones and walls must have been shaken and displaced by the earthquakes to which Syria has been so often subject. The reef to the north is distant about 500 yards, running for half a mile parallel to the coast ; there is still close under it four fathoms. A jetty com posed of blocks, like those I have described, runs out from the southern extremity, leaving but a narrow passage. The reef has not been used only to protect an anchorage ; it also served for a port. The Avhole of it has been cut smooth, leaving only the rock standing on the edge, like a pie-crust. The stone has been grooved, and many of the blocks still remain cut all round, as if the works had been interrupted ; this is, however, only towards the extremity.

The historical value of this topographic scrutiny must chiefly consist in the limits Avhich it must assign to the shipping- of Sidon.

Had the sand risen as at Beyrout, no trace of Saida would be found to-day.

Besides, if not the practice, at least it is the maxim of the Church of Rome, \" to satisfy doubts but not to raise them.\" These matters Avere freely discussed on my visit to the school. A Priest was somewhat startled when I mentioned the prohibition of Proselytism by his Church, while he had passed over with suave indifference my reference to the precepts of Christ. There Avas indeed no offence taken, as would have been the case with a Protestant. It was rather relief he experienced, at the (to him) neAV thought, that proselytism was not a Christian duty. The only word put in, in denegation was, that \" as the Mussulmans propagated their faith by the sword, the Christian might use the weapon of persuasion.\" This led to an exposure of the falsehood of that as sertion and its impossibility. They listened Avith astonishment to the passages from the Koran estab lishing* directly the reverse. I then appealed to their OAvn experience as to the toleration of the Turks, and asked them Avhat Syria Avould be under any Christian Government.

At length I asked leave to put tAvo questions, which being granted, I put as follows : 1. Are your young men better sons than the rest? 2. Are they more loyal subjects? On this a silence of minutes ensued. The master had opened his mouth, but no sound proceeded. Find ing that I did not intend to say more, and that I awaited an answer, he at last turned on the vice consul an appealing glance, from whom at last broke the AA-ords : \" How true is what you say.\" I remarked that I had said nothing, and was only seeking for informa tion from them. \" You have said every thing,\" he replied, \" and you have said nothing that has not already been in our minds.\" Then, turning to the master, he continued, \" Hoav often have Ave deplored the same thing ?

I sheAved them that as Roman Catholics, those duties were peculiarly imposed on them by injunction, and that they set at nought the spiritual authority of their church, when plotting to subvert the laAVS of the country which afforded them so large a hospitality, and permitted them to exercise such influence among its subjects. The circle of listeners having been enlarged, I was begged to enter fully on a matter which touched them all so nearly : I did so, and dwelt on the consequences to themselves if England and France should be called upon their soil in struggie of arms, as hoav they were in competi tion of influence ; or if the Turkish Government at last gave up the land to flame and the SAvord. I had the satisfaction of hearing* them express thankfulness. They assured me that henceforward my warning should influence the course pursued in the school at Saida. I had the opportunity of sheAving* them in the person of one of the young men, whom they had instanced as having been rendered unfit for his sta tion in life, the extreme facility of bringing* them back to that state, and also that the knowledge of usages must first be possessed by the instructor. I fear, in the Avant of the latter, that their good in tentions will serve little. A drop in the ocean is little as to quantity, what then is a drop in the Niagara, as to direction ?

I met him at dinner at the Consul's table. They ex p ected him to sit at mine, and were amazed to see him fall back at once into his own station of life, on a look and Avithout a word. I must not omit to make honourable mention of a bath at Saida. There are five of them in the town ; the one I mean is called Yeni Hammam. In abun dance of linen, industry of shampooing, sedulous ness of service, variety of rooms, graduation of tem perature, and degree of heat (which is often wanting) I have met nothing like it in my present trip. It has not the Alhambra-like splendour of those of Emir Beshir ; but it is a temperately ornate and more finished work. In this sense, no bath, even at Con stantinople, equals it ; the habit of employing old blocks of marble j capitals of columns, and the like, has given an irregularity to Turkish baths even where the materials are gorgeous. Here there was no piece of stone or marble not specially carved for it. The colours were Avhite, black, and yellow ; the Avhite was marble, the black the lignite of the Lebanon, the yelloAV the limestone of the Lebanon, which when Avet equals in beauty marble of the richest colour.

The distance from Saida to Sur (Tyre) is seven and a half hours, so starting at noon I expected to reach by sunset. Intending* to visit, as I left the toAvn, the English consular agent, I sent to say so. He was absent at Beyrout, but I found his brothers, a numerous fraternity, and some neighbours as sembled. They opened a vast subject, and were so earnest that they kept me till three o'clock. The assemblage had been specially convened, as soon as they learnt my intended visit, and as the subject underwent a more thorough investigation than it ever had before, I shall report with careful accuracy. The oldest of the brothers opened the matter by stating, that they Avere much injured by the Com mercial Treaty with England ; that they had been year after year expecting a change. They had over and over again represented their grievances as folloAVS : \u2014 \" The Treaty increases the customs for English merchants from 3 to 12 per cent; this rate, introduced for the foreign trade, is applied to the internal trade. Out of this have grown up monopo lies Avhich were unknoAvn in Syria, which had been"], [302, "288 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. abolished in Turkey by the Hatti sheriff of Gul hane. The apaltatori, or farmers of revenue, have now recourse to all sorts of vexations to harass the general trade, having become traders themselves.\" I requested to be informed of the specific differ ence under the Treaty, as to each article exported from Saida. The answers were as follow: \u2014 Tobacco. This is the principal export. It varies from the Ioav price of eight paras the oke, (7 Jibs, for one penny) to five piastres. The utmost production is 14,000 cantars of 2 cwt. each. It goes principally to Egypt, in bales composed of all qualities, the outer leaf being of the lowest kind; and in the centre a little of the best ; the aggregate value is under two piastres the oke. Formerly there was one charge of 14 paras for all kinds of tobacco, Avhich, in the tobacco of Latakia, some of which sold for 30 and 50 piastres, Avas but a fractional duty. It fell, hoAvever, heavily on the Lebanon, amounting to 25 per cent on the lowest quality, seven per cent on the highest. They looked, therefore, under the neAV Treaty, to be relieved from this burden, as 12 per cent ad valorem duty Avould have been to them a reduc- tion of more than tAvo-thirds. HoAvever, instead of that, under the name of 12 per cent, the duty Avas raised from 14 paras to 76 paras. This amounted on the loAvest quality to 1000 per cent, and on their Avhole exportation to 100 per cent. There being, at present, precisely the same sum paid for the tobacco and for the duty. The lower qualities Avould have"], [303, "289 IMMORAL AND IRRELIGIOUS DUTIES. remained unsold, if the apaltatori had not bought the tobacco, and sent it themselves to Egypt. Besides the effect has been to open Egypt to foreign tobacco, the coarse qualities of which, paying only five per cent duty, are introduced from Greece, Barbary, and even America. Silk. This article comes next in the Saida market : it is the produce of the southern portion of the Moun tain, amounts to from 10,000 to 15,000 okes, is of a coarse quality, and is dyed and wrought in Saida. It is used for tassels to caps, and lace for embroidery. It is exported chiefly to Egypt, but is also sent to Constantinople, and other parts of Turkey. Before the treaty, silk paid on entering the toAvns 4 per cent, and on leaving it, dyed for exportation, 3 more. The silk raw, is Avorth about 100 piastres the oke; dyed red, 130; blue, 170; so that the manufactured article paid in all, in one case 3, in the others 1J- per cent. Under the Treaty it pays 12 per cent, Avhich is charged on entering the toAvn. When dyed, or manufactured, it is considered a new article, and pays 12 per cent more, which 12 per cent is calculated by the tariff at 42 piastres. The duty on the dyed silk is thus 54 piastres, instead of 7 ; so that on this article the difference produced by the treaty is 47 piastres. Grain. On this article the effect of the treaty is to multiply the duty by 23. The former icktisab was 1 para for 8 okes, noAv the tariff is 23 paras for 8 okes. There Avere here no restrictions on its ex- D"], [304, "290 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. portation. (The duty Avas raised from one farthing to ed.) Soap. A manufacture of Saida. The oil for merly paid 4 paras the 30 okes. It noAv pays 15 piastres, or above one hundred-fold. The potass formerly paid on importation 3 per cent ; it now pays 5. The soap on exportation formerly paid 3 per cent; itnoAvpays 12. The difference betAveen the old and the new duties is as 60 to 325, or more than five-fold on a cantar of soap exported. The value of the cantar is 4,600 piastres. As they had referred, in speaking* of former charges, to the regular one of 3 per cent, I in quired if more than that sum Avas not often paid. They ansAvered that it Avas true, that more was often paid ; but that a novel system of abuse has been introduced, that of the farmers becoming* mer chants themselves. Above all, that formerly, the Treaties were considered laAv ; now, the Treaty was so confused and so contradictory, that every thing was arbitrary, and there Avas no use in appealing* to the Consuls. I asked how it Avas that these articles, not one of which Avas exported to Europe or came to England, could be affected by our Treaty ? This question produced an exclamation of sur prise. They answered, \" The rate established for you is of course laid on us. Long ago, we should have been taxed in this Avay ; but they could not tax us while your trade was free. You increase"], [305, "291 IMMORAL AND IRRELIGIOUS DUTIES. the duties for yourselves ; they are then increased for us. Though these articles do not go to England, they are often bought and sold by English mer chants, and are so held to be foreign.\" Having heard all they had to say, I inquired what they wished me to do. They said, \" To understand that this Treaty is a contagion, destroy ing us. It is bad for you, for the Turks, and for us.\" I ansAvered that I was already perfectly aAvare of all that. They said, \" Then we Avant you to tell them in London.\" I said, \" I have told them over and over again, and no one will listen to me.\" \" But,\" remonstrated they, \" the English are a clever people ; cannot they see that this Treaty contradicts itself?\" I answered, \" If you see that the Treaty contradicts itself, hoAv call them a clever people?\" \"But surely, Lord Palmerston is a clever man ; can you not make him see it ?\" \" Lord Palmerston being a clever man does not require me to make him see it.\" \" But then he will change it.\" \" He made it ; why should he change it ?\" After some talk among themselves, one of them said, \" You mean that Lord Palmerston is like our rejals (ministers) at Constantinople ?\" \" No ; for they have the name only.\" Again ensued a bye conversation, and one of them said, \" But Russia is far from here.\" I replied, \" You export grain, she exports grain ; you are governed from Constanti nople, she has an ambassador at Constantinople and a consul at Beyrout.\" They hoav fully appre- u 2"], [306, "292 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. hended ; but again they would return to the Eng lish being a clever people. I laid my hand on the Treaty, the English copy of which had been brought, saying you have here the means of knoAving them ; they have no means of knowing themselves. One of them stated, that being interested in salt, and the Government having monopolised it, he Avent to Colonel Rose to require the fulfilment of the Treaty, which prohibited the imposition of monopolies ; on which Colonel Rose pointed out to him a passage in the third article which contradicted the first, and said that British trade should pay the same duties as the most favoured subjects. This I Avas asked to explain. They had no difficuly in understanding that expla nation, viz. that the Treaty had been made for one purpose and altered for another. They then asked what other changes had been made. I said they themselves had hit upon the most important. The next was the raising the import duty tAvo per cent. The third the imposing one duty of 12 per cent on all exports, whereas the original Treaty contem plated a scale of duties, and the tariff under it, was not to calculate in money one ad valorem duty on all, but to fix what ad valorem per centage each article could bear. Thus Valonia might have had a high duty, because so much cheaper in Turkey than in Europe ; silk would probably have been reduced below the three per cent. The Treaty, intended to facilitate commerce and reduce duties, had been changed so as to increase duties and con-"], [307, "IMMORAL AND IRRELIGIOUS DUTIES. 293 vert them into prohibitions. They then asked me to mark on their copy the interpolated passages, which I did ; also the Additional Articles as to nothing \" but the fair sense being stipulated for,\" and that nothing should be construed as interfering with the \"freedom of internal legislation\" of the Ottoman Em pire. As I was taking my departure, I was asked what I meant when I said that the Turks required no help to put it right. I answered that the Turkish Government had declared by the Hatti sheriff of Gulhane, that all monopolies and all impediments to trade wrere abolished, and could not afterwards take an equivalent for abolishing them. That the duties under the tariff did not bring money into the treasury, but kept money out of it. That the Turkish Go vernment had the tenths in its hand ; and need not go in a roundabout Avay to get taxes so as to ruin their OAvn property, by imitating Governments who had lost the tithe. That their religion prohibited a higher duty than three per cent. That they fancied they imitated Europe, but in Europe no one taxed exports. That Turkey had no preventive system, and could not have one without adding a heavy charge to the expenses of the empire, Avhich Avould absorb more than the whole returns from the cus toms. That the effect of the present duties Avas to clog commerce in regard to heavy goods, and as to the lighter, such as silk, tobacco, &c, to cause it to pass in a great measure in contraband. These AA-ere the reasons they had to urge Avith the Turks, to in-"], [308, "294 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. duce them to drop the treaty, which they could not do till they understood it, but which was the easiest of all things when understood. It was now three o'clock, but I was told there was a village half way where I could sleep, and as I had sent on my baggage horses Avith orders to wait half Avay, I started. We passed under an alley of the ambar tree which produces the small yelloAV flower; its leaves are like a fine acacia, the trunk unites the knots of the oak and the spring of the platanus ; elsewhere they are but shrubs. The gar dens on this side extend little, for water is Avanting ; the land, however, is equally rich, and a strip of this black loam runs betAveen the beach and the chalky hills. It is a dead level, without a tree or a house. The people have their villages on the hills. As the water might be conducted from the hills, it is probable that this was formerly a continuation of gardens and country mansions, where rested the merchant princes from their labours, and tasted their luxuries. Nothing* could be more happily chosen, if I am to judge from the scene and the day. Some clouds served as an aAvning in the heavens, and a breeze came in from the sea. There was heat enough to enjoy the breeze, light enough to make the cloud a pleasure, and cloud and breeze enough to make the sun acceptable. In visiting the TJpogea, or caverns, with Avhich the rocks to the left are filled, I rode up a broAv, and came in sight unexpectedly of Tyre, looking"], [309, "295 IMMORAL AND IRRELIGIOUS DUTIES. like a projecting tongue of alluvial land covered with trees. Behind me was old grey Sidon, and before young* green Tyre ; I turned from the one to the other, and could Avith difficulty tear myself from the place ; but the sun, though shrouded, approached the horizon, and Avarned me to press on. The clouds spread in dark masses to within a few degrees of the horizon, Avhere they left a space which stretched in a straight line as if drawn by rule. Behind, the flood of ruddy light poured like an etherial water fall ; on the eastern side the beautiful phenomenon of the anhelion mimicked, in its party-coloured radiation, the rising* sun ; for a moment I Avas per plexed, as if I had been suddenly turned round, but then I was reassured by the large disc of the sun, which broke into the open space below the clouds, and suddenly lit them up Avhere darkest, in fragments, patches, and lines, as a distant light might strike on a pannelled roof. Hoav immense did that con tinent of sky noAv appear.

That human beings do become 'cynics and misan thropes may be as inconceivable to those who have not become so themselves, as that there should be assassins*and poisoners. If incomprehensible, it is at all events indubitable, that there are such. To me it is no longer incomprehensible, because during this ride I have all but become so myself, the oc casion being this very conversation. These dozen men, assembled to pour out to me their distress and their lamentations, would, if I had told them that the Treaty was mine, and that it was all right, have held their tongues, bowed their heads, not have ventured to utter a word that was in their thoughts, and probably have told me that I was the benefactor and saviour of their native land. At best they would have suggested alterations, in order to improve the Avork. Could anything be more hateful than human nature thus exhibited? Turn to the Turks.

Well, this Grand Dragoman I have been for the last month daily at Avork upon, and cannot drive into him the faintest idea of the matter.

By their authority and poAver this Treaty was imposed. They know the effects of placing prohibitory duties on the exports of a coun try. They have been for years engaged in inducing other countries to abandon restrictions on trade ; here they force a Treaty upon Turkey to prohibit her own exports. These exports would otherwise come to themselves. Not a word has ever been said in England except in commendation of this Treaty. When a statement of the case was made in the House of Commons, the Minister could get up and justify his conduct, amidst cheers, by stating it to be the reverse of Avhat it Avas. The English then are exactly on the same line as the merchants I left this morning at Saida \u2014 or worse : they dare to speak of it; the English do not. This Treaty has been my occupation of years; involving ceaseless toil and anxiety, ultimately crowned with success. By a quiet, peaceful, com mercial operation, I expected to cause to cease the interference of Russia in Europe as Avell as in Turkey; for trade being suffered to return to its"], [313, "299 IMMORAL AND IRRELIGIOUS DUTIES. natural channels, she should be deprived of the ficti tiously created financial means by which she is en abled to disturb the world. The measure had been accepted on these grounds, and as realizing these ends, by the English Government ; it is, at the mo ment of signing, by the alteration of a paragraph and the insertion of a clause, changed into an instru ment for the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire, and transfers to Russia the monopoly of the supply of grain for Europe !

Before the siege by Alexander, the island of Tyre sheltered a channel, in the same manner as the island of Sidon. A glance at the place from the terrace this morning, in the midst of the hurri cane, sufficed, in consequence of the study I had made of the island of Sidon, to satisfy me as to its geology. The rock of Saida is not a regular stratum, but a mere induration of sand, like that which I found on the Avestern coast of Africa. There the forma tion of it has taken place on the surface of a bank several hundred feet high ; at first I took this sand stone for that Avhich I had found in the Lebanon, under the calcareous formation; but afterwards I observed it worked into circular holes, and leaving standing points, so like that of Morocco, that I suspected that it must be of a similar nature. This conclusion I had means of establishing along the coast. The difference with the sand coast of Morocco is, that it has been formed nearly at the level of the sea ; at Saida it has nowhere more than 20 feet elevation : at one point on the"], [316, "302 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. coast, there is a headland running out with a square tower, where it may be 50 feet ; but there its nature is changed, and it contains large quantities of rolled stones from the calcareous range : othenvise it is found at intervals lying along* the beach, more like a mere induration of the sea sand, than a distinct stratum. The face of the country has, in other re spects, remained the same ; the Roman mile-stones, when formed of materials too hard for their chisels, or too heavy for their means of transport, lie in the places Avhere they stood only half buried ; and in a field, I observed the one pier of a bridge of unmis takable Ph\u0153nician stones, which crossed a mean dering rivulet ; which iioav, so far as marked by this river, folloAVS exactly the course it held tAvo or three thousand years ago. Finding the island of Tyre to be a sandstone of the same description, there can have been no lofty and beetling rock to oppose the \" bank cast up\" by Alexander. The rain continued to batter and the wind to hoAvl till shortly before sunset, giving me time to loiter on the ramparts, and admire the Avaves dash ing over the long reefs of the fallen Avails, here and there certified as Tyrian by the projecting fragments of granite columns. The rock is the agglomerated sand. There are, standing above the water to the south-Avest, calcareous masses, which I might have mistaken for the rock of the place, but for those"], [317, "303 CONTRAST OF TIMES. still standing remnants of breakAvater at Saida. The plateau of the city is not more than ten or tAvelve feet above the level of the sea. The modern toAvn covers a half of the space ; there are towers and remains of fortifications of the middle ages, Avith some large edifices of the Turks. The Avhole has been encircled by a breastwork, directed against the English and their valiant allies in the heroic contest of 1840, which commenced at this place, and where the actors escaped halters, if they did not win crowns. On the breastwork to the west, I had the pleasure of seeing, notwith standing the state of the Aveather, the nets spread out to dry ; and on an open space behind, a number of boys were playing at ball in a peculiar, and therefore to be supposed a Tyrian manner. This visitation I had endeavoured to perform alone, but was per force accompanied by a train worthy of a Pasha in the olden time ; not that I Avas expected either to find treasure or to lecture on \" Progress and Civilization ;\" but I was a Frank, and might be a Consul. One of my courtiers this day, for though not a consul, a court was forced upon me, Avas the bro ther of my hostess. He brought a strong certificate from Captain Elliot for his services \" in the Sultan's cause,\" and various other documents proving* his story, which was this. He Avas the first to raise the people, had got possession of Tyre, and paid out of his OAvn pocket the men he enlisted ; he hard"], [318, "304 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. acted by the orders of the English officers, and had spent 40,000 piastres, all his substance. The Turks gave him a command, but, on the AvithdraAval of the English squadron, displaced him. He had appealed again and again to the Consul in vain, was now naked, and had only one pound a month, Avhich he got from the farmer of customs, to sleep every night outside the Avails, to watch that tobacco was not smuggled. He came to beg my intercession with the Consul. I told him it Avould avail him little. That I Avas, besides, of opinion that he was very rightly served ; that the Turks had done quite right in displacing* a man who had taken up arms because told to do so by a foreign agent, and that I could not try to have him recompensed for obliging men, Avho ought every one of them to be hanged as pirates. He seemed quite aware of the nature of the transaction as regarded our officers, and then shifted his claim to the score of the Sultan. Think ing him already sufficiently punished, and on his professing* his abhorrence of all intermeddlers, Avhich I believe was noAv real enough, I promised to sub mit his case to the Pasha. I have mentioned the identity of the rock on Avhich Tyre and Sidon are built Avith that lining* the coast of Morocco ; a rock which constitutes there the defence of the country, and to peculiarities of which I have traced the chief characteristic of Moorish architecture; an architecture of which I then derived the original from the Holy Land."], [319, "CONTRAST OF TIMES. 305 This resemblance did not stand alone. On the hill above Saida, I observed an oblong vault, the same as those still standing* at Shemish (in Morocco), and Avhich I have described. The arch being* constructed in the same remarkable manner : that is, as if the wall had been built round a mould. Along the coast, the only buildings seen are, as in Mo rocco, the cubbe and dome of the tombs. The chief apartment in this house exhibited the same affinity. Apparently, nothing can be more dissimilar than the Moorish room, of thirty-five feet long* by seven Avide, without a window, and lighted only from a large portal in the centre, and this apartment, which is supported by arches, lighted by four spreading AvindoAvs, and Avith a depressed passage traversing it in the middle. The affinity lay, hoAvever. in the es sentials; this room had that Moorish feature which is its OAvn exclusively, tAvo apartments joined at the base, Avhich is therefore the centre. My mind occupied in these associations, Ave sat down to dinner, and what should appear on table but Couscoussou ! They did not know it by the name, but called it Mograbi, or dish \" from the Avest.\" It was admirably cooked, but the make was far inferior to the Moorish ; the particles Avere too large and hard ; they roll them with the palm of the hand instead of the tips of the fingers. I was all the better pleased to have recalled to me, by a favourable comparison, my hostess among the Ziaida. It is needless to say that here Couscous- x"], [320, "306 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. sou had to be eaten with a spoon; they listened with ill-suppressed incredulity when I explained to them the process of making* \"cora,\" and the dex terity Avith which, at arm's length, the Mograbees projected these into their mouths. My host Avas called Atala, aud Avas a Catholic Greek. He Avore the old costume, but his house, family, and establishment, as well as his ideas, pre sented an epitome of many things. Eastern had not yielded here to Western manners, and a gro tesque caricature Avas enacted every moment. The old man laboured to determine in Avhat order self, guest, and A\\ife were to be served. The eldest son with a cap instead of a turban, strutted about the room Avith Frank creaking shoes on his feet ; pre sently he came in, and served the pipes and coffee. He ventured not to sit down before his father ; but his son, a boy of tAvelve years old, had no such scruples, and only Avaited till he had learnt English, to call his father \" Governor.\" The hostess Avas a fine woman of fifty ; she wore the open robe short, and the long wide trousers of the same stuff under it. A spreading shuffa floAved over her back, waving with every jaunty step, as she strode in her pattens, which raised her six inches from the floor. The shuffa is an imitation of plaited hair (Chaitie), but amounting to ten times the hair any woman's head ever bore : it is spread out so as to fall from shoulder to shoulder, and is entirely covered by a coat of mail, formed of small oblong flattened tags"], [321, "307 CONTRAST OF USAGES. of gold. They Avere kind, but very embarrassing*, with their attempted tables and knives and forks, and Avould not get out of the notion that it Avas my extreme humility which made me prefer sitting on the ground, and eating Avith my fingers. At last I silenced the stupid talk by telling them that Christ eat with his fingers, and that neither Solo mon nor Charlemagne, Alexander nor Themistocles, had ever seen a fork. The usual tedious discussion on this conflict of manners folloAved : a priest who came in backed me thoroughly. I should be glad to put in his OAvn words some of his remarks ; but that which has effect from its simplicity, and because it is a testimony of latent thoughts, is not translatable or writeable, and I have difficulty in recalling ideas on a subject worn to me threadbare, and nauseating by its constant recurrence in the shape of sights that annoy or discussions that fatigue. The priest, however, bore I thought rather hard on the old man, so I carried the war into his oavii quarters. I told him to look at home and see what his church had done to upset the ideas and manners of the people, which it had been the first to disturb. He Avas astounded and asked the explanation. I told him that at mass that morn ing, I had been shocked Avith tAvo pieces of the grossest indecency ; first, that they Avalked into the church with the polluted shoes from the street ; the second, that at the elevation of the host they pulled about their dress (turbans), and exposed their poor x*2"], [322, "308 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. bald shaved pates. He said that was the rule ob served in the church for eighteen hundred years, and the Turks had been ordered as a distinction to take off their shoes and keep on their turbans. I asked where the rule was to be found for the one, or the order for the other : he did not knoAv. I told him, that I myself had seen this very change, and from similar causes, commence in the Greek church. He contended that it was a proper sign of respect to take off the turban. I asked why they did not do it then when they entered the church, and if it was with them a manner of sheAving respect ; if, on the contrary, it was not a shame to expose the head ; and lastly, Avhether God from the burning* bush had told Moses to pull off his turban, and had not told him to take off his shoes ? He answered, that the ceremonial laAV had been abolished under the new dispensation. I asked if these things were in the ceremonial laAV ? I finally brought him to confess that neither he nor any members of hie church had ever thought on the subject ; and that it was some strangers from Rome, who knew nothing of the country, and Avho sought to innovate in their igno rance or pride, Avho had commenced this disturbance of immemorial custom ; of which he could perceive the ridicule in the circumstances around us, and the evil consequences alike in the character and fortunes of the people. December 10th. \u2014 I went to the bath, but it Avas such a hole that I had to return re-infecta. After"], [323, "TYRE 309 losing two hours by being kept for breakfast I got off by midday. I Ava3 very desirous of visiting the reefs around, to trace which Avas natural rock, which masonry, and to follow the lines of fallen walls, if perchance they might yet be distinguished. But the sea Avas rolling too heavily to expect smooth water for four and twenty hours at least, had it then fallen calm ; I therefore contented myself with visiting the port. It looks to the north, and though not so shalloAA', is less spacious than that of Saida ; it has two entrances, one to the Avest, and one to the north. The current from the south runs through and keeps it in some degree clear. The moles now standing are of recent structure, in which polished granite columns are largely employed; they lie about in heaps, or protrude from the ground and Avater. The anchorage is in front of the port, and open to the north ; the holding ground is uphill and good. On leaving the gates, we came on a portion of the ancient city higher than the rest, all dug out and quarried, as if a city were building in its neighbour hood ; and this quite recently. I had marvelled and marvelled at the Aviping out of this place ; had it fallen into the deep, or been destroyed by the ele ments, or carried off by man ; how could such masses so totally disappear? I now came to reflect that Tyre had been exposed to plunder in a greater degree than any other ancient city of note. It was on the high way of traffic ; it was all exposed, attracting the eye of every seafarer ; every vessel"], [324, "310 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. could embark materials from its bay. Nineveh and Babylon were covered in, Memphis and Thebes might be a quarry for some petty neighbouring town, once in ten centuries. The ravaging of Tyre must have commenced a thousand years before that of other memorable places. From the time of Alex ander it has lain so exposed ; and at hand during* the great building periods of Rome and all her tributary cities, doAvn to Constantinople. Tyre may even have contributed colonnades to Carthage. A more wonderful object aAvaited me on getting to the isthmus. Here Avas the seven months' work of Alexander's army:\u2014 a causeway carried two miles through the sea ; and at the extremity rising to face and overtop Avails of 150 feet in height. From Mount Soracte to look doAvn on Rome ; from the Giant's Mount, to trace the windings of the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn, is to overwhelm the mind with reminiscences recalled, and reflections suggested. There has been accumulated the poAver of the earth ; there has been grasped the faculties of land and sea. But the scenes are too vast ; and in either case, the spot before you sinks into insignifi cance, in its ungraspable associations. Neverthe less, a piece of earth in both cases, supplies food for the substance of the mind, vast, delightful and en during. Far different, however, was that species of food as furnished by this bit of rock, on which I looked out from my chamber in the roof. There Avas a sense"], [325, "311 TYRE of possession in its minuteness, and an infinitely greater proportionate expansion in its associations. This little fragment once commanded the sea ; and the sea always commands empire and the earth. It was not that this empire sprung up the patrimony of trafficking and ingenious men. Empire had already been the conquest of one state great in numbers, arts, permanency and dominion ; had passed to another, equally rearing itself by conquest ; and the Tyrian dominion arose after and between the rivalries, of Egypt and Assyria. Not that it triumphed over them, but continued throughout their struggles, remaining arbiter at their close. Listen to Alexander on the opposite shore, as he addresses his Macedonians. \" I can by no means deem it safe, my friends and companions, to continue our pursuit of Darius, Avhile Tyre remains unsubdued. Whilst Ave are pushing* our conquests against Babylon and Darius, our enemies by the help of their fleet might transfer the war to Greece.

Had the island of Tyre been some cable lengths further out, the conquering career of Alexander would have been arrested. Had the other cities of Ph\u0153nicia not been reduced, and their navies not been brought against Tyre, Tyre Avould not have fallen.* The Ph\u0153nicians fell as the Lebanon has fallen, by dis union amongst themselves f After riding along the southern beach of the isthmus, I came unexpectedly, having* no guide, on a gush of water, Avhich I took to be the stream from the aqueduct. I traced its course a short Avay, and came on tanks built up in masses of old masonry. The description corresponded ; but this could not be the Fountain of Solomon. 1 soon observed an aque duct of larger dimensions, turning* towards the same point, and following it about a couple of miles came to other sources equal to any expectations; there were three or four pools raised about twenty-five feet : one of the blocks of masonry was eighty feet square; * It was during this siege that chain caWes were first used, in consequence of the dexterity of the Tyrian divers, who constantly cut away the ground tackle of their adversaries. t In another work, \" The Pillars of Hercules,\" I have said so much upon the Ph\u0153nicians, that I avoid enlarging on the subject here. But as their inventions were the elements of their great ness, I must beg the curious reader to consult that work for the proofs which I have there collected of their having discovered the Mariner's Compass ; an essay which should have more properly belonged to a work describing Tyre and Sidon, than to one de scribing only Tartcssus."], [327, "313 TYRE inside, the pool Avas octagonal ; the water rising* in it pours off at three sluices, and turns six mills. I ob served trout swimming familiarly about, they are not molested. It is a river Avhich springs up, and certainly the Queen of the sea had an unrivalled bowl on land. Nothing can be more idle than the discussion respecting the deflection of the course of the aque duct. I expected to find it running some five or six miles at least northward, and then turning and run ning as many more AvestAvard to Tyre ; otherwise how could the question arise of its determining the position of old Tyre. The whole distance is a few fields ; the water is brought from the beginning in the direction of the base of the isthmus; it forms an angle at one part, but is continuous ; evidently to spare some princely gardens, for it could not be an early Avork. The fountain I have first mentioned, being close at hand, Avould be first employed ; and when its supply Avas insufficient for the growing population, the other source Avould be brought doAvn through lands then adorned and built upon. These are Artesian wells : here, as in so many other cases, the earliest works have only anticipated the most recent discoveries. I had now to make the best of my Avay to a vil lage three hours distant, on the road to Beled Bsharre. We hurried across through cultivated fields, and over the broken ground, Avhich rises above the strip of rich land on the shore ; these bills are poor-looking, full of rock, and destitute of trees, though generally they are under the plough."], [328, "314 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. In the hollows. where there is moisture there are mulberries, and some olive trees of old date. I observed repeatedly what appeared to be fragments of columns on the eminences ; and on visiting one of them it proved to be a square stone post, standing* 10 feet above the ground, and grooved on one side. Soon after, I observed a couple ; they were at a con siderable distance from my road, but I hastened to them, and was recompensed by discovering an ancient oil press complete. The posts stood four feet apart, both had the groove corresponding ; in front was the round trough for crushing, entire : behind the roller lay a block, Avhich might weigh six tons, and close by a deep reservoir for the oil hollowed in the rock. This country must, therefore, at some period, and a very remote one, have been an olive forest. Here may be seen the farm buildings and arrangements of the time of Moses. As the sun was setting, Ave reached the summit of the first range of elevations, and found a village close to it; we entered it, supposing it to be Nacfaya, our place of destination, and Avhither in structions had been sent on to have conack and supper ready. There Avas no conack and no supper, for this was not Nacfaya, Avhich Ave Avere told Avas distant eight hours! My servants were in great disquiet and discomfort, but the gloom gradually yielded before my delight at having succeeded in losing myself. I had observed, as Ave approached the place,"], [329, "315 TYRE several men on horses sitting like statues, and other signs of the neighbourhood of some person of importance. A horse richly caparisoned Avas led by, and as I was admiring him, a Turkish gentleman, as I imagined, came out of a cottage. He was however a Metuali, and nephew to \" Hamed the Bey,\" as they term their chief. He advised me not to attempt going on that night, for the country was a labyrinth. He himself Avas going* in a different direction, but Avould order one of the cottages to be prepared for me. His appearance, address, costume, and attendance, Avas far above any thing I could have expected among* the Metuali, and superior to any thing I had seen among the Druzes. There was no pretence ; the Osmanli was Avell Avorn, and I Avas glad that I had not been diverted from visiting this people by the contemptuous discourses respecting them, to which my ears had become accustomed.

The balmy breath of the Mediterranean streamed up, heightened in fragrance as the Avarmth of the day waned. The clouds seemed in myriads to hold council on the colours they were to put on ; they changed and changed, and I watched and watched, till \" all was grey.\" I had been absent an hour, and found supper ready ; but my French-taught Sidonian was sitting among the baggage. I had a visit from half a dozen of the elders. The name of this village is Aitat ; the second of the name I have met with. I told them of the Aitat of Morocco, their predecessors who recollected having left Syria three thousand years ago. The village is composed of 15 houses ; it pays six thousand piastres a year, or \u00a360, and six hundred measures of grain of eig*ht okes each, equal to \u00a3100 value. The former is for the Govern ment, the latter principally for the chiefs. The Government tax is about \u00a31 a head. They had nothing else to complain of, except bad seasons and short crops. This too reminded me of Morocco, Avhere I had been ansAvered that they only suffered from God's evils, \" Old age and bad Aveather.\" Two other Moorish words met me ; a district called Zchil, and another Garb. They smoke the nar gelle, which, after a few whiffs, they pass round, as the red Indians the pipe. It is a curious instru ment of coarse native manufacture. They do not smoke Toinback, but a composition of tobacco and dibs ; the treacle made by boiling the juice of the"], [331, "317 TYRE grape. I cannot say I liked it much, but it is a sight to see a group of peasants enjoying a luxury, with us restricted at once to the wealthy and the exquisite. The nargille is used by rich and poor, young and old, men and women. We have a notion that it affects the lungs; it Avould not appear so, for the lungs in this country are in such perfect condition that no one seems aware of his having any. Nor let it be supposed that this is in conse quence of the climate ; persons so affected find benefit from it, and it has even been introduced at the hospital in London for diseases of the chest. This hut is a good specimen of that class of houses. It is adapted for the family and the cattle ; but the distinctions of grade are so arranged, that nothing is found of the offensive nature we might suppose. An inclined spot is chosen. The floor is on tAvo levels, the loAver for the cattle. Their heads are on a level with the floor used by the family, and are turned tOAvards it. At the edge of that floor is a holloAV of plastered clay to serve as manger, and as you look down you get familiarized with their various countenances : the row of horned heads affords the image of the decoration of a Doric entablature. Such must have been the manger in which Christ Avas laid. Nothing* could be more unnatural than to go up the stall to lay a child in the mang*er ; nothing more natural than to depose it in one so constructed. Their food is corn, or chopped straw, for both of Avhich the manger equally serves. This"], [332, "318 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. hut contained three camels, two asses, two horses, and six coavs. They occupied the one half and the loAver one, and had their separate door. The people on the upper part had steps, on one side of the con tinuous manger, to get doAvn to the cattle. They had on their oavii platform a small door, through which you could creep out on the higher ground of their side of the house. There Avere no windoAVS and no apertures, except these two doors. In one corner Avas the fire-place with chimney of projecting* cane Avork, coming down to catch the smoke. Clay, plastered and w roughs into ornaments, adorned the chimney and the door. On the clay floor, mats were spread, and on one side were the wicker and clay bins for grain and stores. The roof was sup ported by tAvo transverse Avails hollowed out into Gothic arches, resting* on a column ; the tAvo columns stood in the middle, betAveen the people and the cattle, and interrupted the manger. I had been much dissuaded from venturing among the Metuali, or Kizzil-bash, as they were ferocious and fanatic ; they would not eat Avith Christians or Mussulmans, nor use the dishes out of which they had eaten : that I risked being stoned as well as maltreated in a country Avhere there Avas absolutely nothing of interest either in the way of scenery, antiquities, or people. I naturally ap prehended that, being neither the guest of a chief nor within reach of any person of authority, I might fare ill as regards supper ; but presently a"], [333, "319 TYRE steAved foAvl and a dish of bourgoul made its ap pearance, Avhich A\\ould not have disgraced any country. It must not, however, be omitted that this was paid for, and a bakshish expected for the night's lodgings. I succeeded in affording relief in a recent case of hernia, and Avas soon assailed by patients. Two things are exceedingly painful in travelling; the sight of disease Avhich you cannot relieve, appealing to you in full confidence that you have power to relieve ; and the parting* with friends Avith the ex pression of the hope to meet again, a hope you feel never can be realized. Dec. l\\th. \u2014 I started this morning* with the sun, yet notwithstanding constant inquiries and speedy travelling, I reached Tebnin only two hours before sunset ; though the distance is absolutely insignifi cant. I could not have travelled less than twenty five miles. I Avent over one piece of ground four times. It is true I had first to make for the village I intended to reach last night, which made a differ ence of half the distance. I have not, however, lost my pains. The country is a labyrinth of rounded hills ; each valley breaking into two, these again in like manner bifurcating, Avith villages here and there, so that at the bottom of each valley at least there is a road, and perhaps another over the hill. The people are Avonderfully ignorant, or perhaps affect to be, of places and distances. From eight persons, of whom"], [334, "320 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. we so successively asked the way, we could get no distinct answers : when only three miles distant, some said it was twenty-four, others said they did not knoAv where it was. We overshot it consider- ably, and reached from the opposite side. As we were ascending the hill on which it stands, Ave over- took a person on horseback, of homely but substan- tial mien. He wore a heavy black turban, was short and thick set, with jetty black beard, and a fine open countenance. We addressed to him for the five hundredth time the question, \" Is this the way to Nacfaya ?\" He eyed us, and then broke out into a sort of whistle, \" No Avonder that you did not come,\" said he, \" last night from the east, since this morning* you arrive from the west.\" After this he gave me the salutation which ought to have preceded my question, and told me he had waited supper two hours for me. On arriving, he conducted me to a very nice little apartment, all clay, indeed, but w ith divans round covered in white. I contrasted it, not unfavourably, Avith the row of ox and ass heads, though I was very glad for once to have seen the other. Breakfast Avas brought ; a dish of fried eggs and another of honey, to be scooped alternately with cups of marcook (scons). A fork Avas brought for me ; I said I pre ferred my fingers ; he merely answered, \" I sent for it that you might have your choice.\" What a con trast with the city people of Tyre ! He drank from a vessel with a spout, at arm's length, as the Proven-"], [335, "TYRE 321 cals and the Catalonians ; so this, too, Avas a Tyrian usage. Two persons in perfect rags came in on business ; it was Avonderful to compare the courtly manners and the beggarly attire. My host, after attending* to my wants, entered a little into conver sation, in the light easy way of a man of the world, and then, without pressing, observed how much he should be gratified if I could make it not disagreeable to spend the day there. My Avonder increased respect ing these belied Metuali. This was a man in very humble circumstances, tAvo ragged boys being all his male attendants. In regard to etiquette, there was no more difficulty than as to eating ; he treated me as he would a Mussulman. It was only after I left that I learnt he Avas a Maronite. The village is of 25 houses, but very poor ; they pay 4000 piastres and 400 measures. I asked my host if there was anything behind this : he shook his head, and said, \" There are many oppressions, but the chief is this tax, which the people are too poor to pay ; they have little land.\" I said it struck me that the people had little industry. \" You must have observed,\" he answered, \"hoAv busy they all are.\" \" Yes, at present, for it is sowing time. They are laborious, but not industrious. I see no imple ments in their houses; no home-made clothes on their backs, and I am told by those who knoAv them, that in the intervals of field labour they loll about and do nothing.\" \" There is no interval of labour ; when the grain is not to be soAvn or cut, the tobacco v"], [336, "322 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. is; and if neither, there are grapes and oil.

CHAPTER VIII. THE METUALI. Finding that the chief of all the chiefs, \" Hamed the Bey,\" was not at his capital, I determined to push on for Tamar Bey, seven miles further, as he had returned from his muster, his district being- rated at 7000 males. Tebnin is on a higher level than the hills I had been amongst, and crossing the ridge from which it became visible, I had a last sight of Tyre. The hills, now swelling in dimen- sion without changing in nature, put a neAV face on the landscape, and Avhen I had got to the crest of the ridge, a vast extent of country Avas spread before me. Opposite stood the castle of Teb- nin, crowning a hill ; beyond, lay the country of the Metuali ; and beyond again, rose all along the horizon the mountains of the Druzes. First, there was the Lebanon foreshortened, and of which the edge stood towards you, exposing* at this distance its geological formation, with all its peculiarities of fracture and levels. Then the Anti-Lebanon swept down, and spread further out, the double crest of Gebel el Sheik forming the centre. His crown of snow, since I saw him last, has greatly enlarged its borders. Then along the horizon, the nodule-like Y 2"], [338, "324 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. hills of the Hauran, again Druze country, and which, on the other side, overhangs the Ledja, and looks upon Damascus. The castle of Tebnin, which I had heard of as the stockade of a Metuali chief, was a whitewashed building, tumbling in ruins ; but still in its strange towers, curtains, and escarpments, there is some thing of the Crusades. I looked again, and Avas reminded of a frontispiece to an Elzevir edition of C\u00e6sar's Commentaries, in Avhich, in my youth, I had pored over an Helvetic illustration of Roman cir cumvallation. There was the turreted circles, the scarped cone, and the Avhole placed on a mountain. I descended the gully and scrambled up the other side, and now, on a nearer approach, I could distin guish the materials. The small squared stones of the country appeared above ; but the lower part was of other masonry. Was it Saracen or Pe lasgic? Roman or Jewish? was it Tyrian or Cy clopic ? It was all these, and more. I reached a little straggling village on the plateau beloAV the castle, and intended to leave there my horse while I ran up to look at the inside of the ruin, Avhen my bridle Avas seized by a couple of men, who turned me round, and I found I Avas to be conducted so to it. A person of official air, Avith European pistols in his belt, then addressed me, saying that he had received that forenoon orders from his master to have the castle in readiness for my reception, and to make his apologies for not"], [339, "325 THE METUALI. being able to be there to receive me. Of course I had noAv to give up the idea of proceeding that night, and was wondering to Avhat I could OAve such unexpected civilities, when one of the men conduct ing me said, \" We heard this morning that Daoud Bey was to arrive to-night, and we have been watching all day.\" Nor could I get any explana tion beyond this. We reached.the gate by a paved ramp ; we passed the portal of modern style, and found ourselves be tween mean and ruined Avails, in the midst of mud and filth. Entering a small court, I dismounted on a step opposite to a rude cavern, rather than chamber, which seemed to be the scene appointed for the pre parations. Against the Avail was placed one of those bed frames, or raised estrades of Avood, six or seven feet wide and eight long, Avith a railing round three \u00a9 C 7 \u00a9 sides, on Avhich a mattress is laid with cushions around, which may be garnished with the richest stuffs. This may be carried into the garden, or placed in the rudest apartment, and serves for sleeping at night and living by day, free from the inconveniences of dirty floors or unfurnished Avails. Such a Farash was placed in this cavern ; and so soon as I had taken my place excellent sherbet Avas served in cut crystal, the napkin richly embroidered. Then followed a Persian nargille in gold and enamel, and at the first \u00a9 \u00a9 J Avhiff the odour of Shiraz revealed itself. I then saw that it Avas a Persian who had presented it. The Vakil came again to make excuses ; that the place"], [340, "326 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. was ruined, as indeed I saAv, that the only apart ments covered in were the Harem, that the Bey Avas noAv constructing* proper apartments above, and he much regretted they were not ready. These I after wards saw ; they were as regards the stone work in very good style, and the colour, though coarse, was also free from the false European taste. I proposed visiting the ruins, when a pompous old Persian walked in and endeavoured to engage me in con versation on Shah Shoojah, Runjet Sing, und Cabool. This Shirazi Tombac, this Irani Khan, are they evi dences of another foreign influence ? Strangely di vided race, Avhere every force is centrifugal. I hoAvever broke away from Herat and PeshaAvar, with which the Khan did not cease to pursue me all round the battlements, first to examine the ruins, then to view the country. The first operation took up all that remained of the day, leaving also something for the morroAv. The second Avas performed at intervals in the course of our scramble ; and here I nearly ter minated my career. After so many ruins scrambled over with impunity, here on a ledge my left foot slipped, so that both legs shot out over a height of sixty feet ; but a branch of a tree was within reach by Avhich I caught. The sun had gone down for us, when I was exa mining and sounding one of the cisterns, of which they count 360. As I emerged I had a glimpse of the country to the north and east, as if lighted up by a flame of barytes. I got on the top of a Avail"], [341, "THE METUALI. 327 and watched the changes over this wild theatre, con- structed of so many and such diverse forms, and already painted in so many colours. The Lebanon was clear ; Gebel Sheik Avas as but the basis of a pile of clouds, themselves a mountain tAvice Mount Blanc; only that toAvards the middle there hung a thin ho- rizontal streak, which spread as an awning over half the heavens. The sun, as I have said, had set for us behind a hill; he had set too for the lowlands of the Metuali, but he was playing with all his smiles on the green cliffs and slopes of the Lebanon, and striking on the clouds in floods of orange and purple. The pure sky seemed struggling with itself as to what precious stone it Avould be ; the victory remained with the sapphire, for as the sun departed, the lines of colour rose in the opposite sky, and all the shades of red passed over its face, till the last glow went ; and then came the blue to the air, and the grey to the land, and the Avhite to the clouds ; and as the colours rose the clouds descended, and laid bare the snowy crests of the old head of the Sheik against the azure heavens. The Khan, whose Farsi chatter had even been arrested, now exclaimed, \" It is like a sunset at Herat.\" Now came the question, Avas I to eat alone ? The supper was served for one. I begged the Khan to let me feel his pulse, and remonstrated with him on the injury his health Avas undergoing by too much fasting. The contest ended abruptly by his plunging his hand"], [342, "328 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. into the dish. They brought me, just as they would do in our highlands, bad bread instead of excellent \u00a9 7 cakes, for which I did not fail to ask, and after they came, to scold. December 12th. \u2014 My demand for marcook brought me this morning a distinguished compliment. A message from the Harem, a repetition of that from Hamed the Bey, and Avith breakfast a bundle of mar cook, Avhich the ladies had themselves prepared. I again inspected the castle, and admired the view. There runs through the middle, one of those ancient walls, tAvelve feet thick, built of stones of five and six feet long. I here saw what appeared to me the earliest form of stones, chiselled on the edges and the centre left rough, as we find among the Etruscans and Romans ; a broad border is chiselled, and the centre is leftVery high ; in fact nothing has been taken off it, no chisel has been used, it has been picked smooth by strokes of a pointed hammer or pickaxe, and the mark is there as if they had just come from the quarry. Inside of the building* these stones are not to be found, so to say in situ, but built Avith other large stones of very ancient structure, yet taken from ruins more ancient still. The rock on Avhich the castle is placed has been scarped all round to a slope, and Avhere the rock fails the talus is made up Avith masonry. The recent rains had laid bare a considerable portion of this work, and I stood in face of a Jewish, if not Philistine, edifice or es carpment, still standing above 100 feet in height."], [343, "329 THE METUALI. This Avas something, considering that the great con querors of the earth had conspired to fill up their ditches, and level their Avails. This fortress bears testimony to the Avell-digging propensities of the Canaanites. They reckon 360 cisterns, and I do not think the estimate excessive ; wherever the ground is a little disencumbered you cannot walk ten paces without coming on the mouth of one. The Avhole stands on a substructure of cis terns. BeloAv the fortress the ground is in like manner burroAved. The women were draAA'ing water from one on the neck of the hill, and five or six others were stopped up. Elsewhere and everyAvhere they are to be found, sometimes Avith extensive masses of masonry supporting them, columns standing* in them, and other indications of their having been covered in. The fortress has not been merely a rude defence ; however strong, it has been embellished in its day. I saw a granite column and several fragments of marble, but the most interesting memorial Avas one of the large sarcophagi. A fragment indeed only remains, placed on a mass of stone and mortar ma sonry, which has noAv slipped doAvn ; but the Avhole has evidently been part of the building*, and iden tifies it Avith the people Avho have left these nameless tombs, and these again Avith the mortar walls. Standing on the highest summits to the north, DO 7 the Vakil, who I find is also a Persian, pointed out to me the wide domains that own his master's SAvay, the crests of three of the seven castles which his"], [344, "330 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. father had built. \" Here,\" pointing towards Sidon, \" you travel seven hours through Metuali country ; here, towards Tyre, six hours ; here, towards Gebel Sheik, six hours; there, towards Acre, six hours; to cross it in any direction requires a summer's day, and from one frontier to another a woman may pass with gold in her hand unharmed.\" I asked how many men he had for his guard, and for this service ; he ansAvered ten. He then said that one hundred villages had been entirely ruined, that the country had never recovered from the ravages of Jezzar Pasha, that they had no water, and had heavy taxes. He hoped better days were coming*, since the Sultan had got his OAvn again (from Ibrahim Pasha he meant). Tebnin is the ancient Thoron of the Crusades, and ill-famed in their story. It is reported as built by Hugh of St. Omer, to whom, on the acces sion of the second Baldwin, Tancred, who Avent to replace Bohemond, abandoned Galilee. But of course it was as much built by him as by the modern Metuali chief Avho claims, in our days, to be its founder. The 600,000 warriors and the lion hearted Richard who constituted the third Crusade, ended with, and Avas summed up in the capture of Acre ; but all the other places on the coast were lost to the Christians. The fourth Crusade mus tered itself to an attack on Thoron, and melted before that place.

This Avas the moment for the neAV armies just arrived from Europe to regain their lost ground. They issued from Acre, and, in proceed ing northAvard along the coast, Avere attacked by the whole force of the Mussulmans, Avho crossed the Lebanon to meet them on the river Eleuthros. They Avere beaten so thoroughly, that all the towns of the coast, from Sidon to Laodicea, fell without resistance into the hands of the Franks. Their power was thus restored from Antioch to Ascalon in the maritime region, and the fortress of Thoron alone held out. The Christians Avere determined to besiege it. The details of this opera tion are given by Arnold de Lubeck in a manner to rival the sieges of Antioch, Jerusalem, and Acre. The height of the wall, the enormous size of the rocks on which it was placed, the difficulties of the approach, the fruitlessness of the first efforts of the Crusaders, the security of the besieged, whom no missiles reached, and the effect of their missiles on the besiegers, all would lead to the inference that this was a castle placed on a cliff, and defended by its height and solidity. But its strength Avas in the labour of some early race, and the subsequent events of the siege sheAV that it Avas so. After a continued repetition of those efforts of daring valour which signalized the sieges of the Crusaders, but without thereby making any impression on the place, a new process was discovered. In the ranks"], [346, "332 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. and serving under the Duke of Saxony were miners from Ramsburg ; they undertook to mine the Avails, and succeeded so well, that Avithout stroke of the battering-ram, and to the consternation of the besieged and the joy of the besiegers, down tumbled toAvers and curtains as by a miracle. Here there is no mistaking Tebnin, and I think I can fix on the spot towards the south end where this attack was made, at a place where the present lines fall within the ancient ones, and where the built talus is displaced. In fact, the miners commenced beloAv the foundation of the talus, which, giving way, of course brought down on them the ramparts them selves, which perhaps overhung the spot of the mine by a couple of hundred feet. The Mussulmans, losing all hopes of safety, sent to offer the place with all its riches, and all they asked was to be allowed to retire Avith life. But this Christian camp was without chiefs Avho could command or soldiers who would obey. Some were rejoiced at the submission of the Saracens, some were enraged at seeing* a plunder, which they deemed in their hands, snatched away by a capitu lation. The envoys of Thoron were received in a public assembly, and conditions Avere settled Avith them ; but the adverse party Avarned them against submission, as they could expect no mercy. On returning, they represented the fury and the divi sions of the Christian camp; and the inhabitants and garrison, animated at once, if I may so say, with"], [347, "333 THE METUALI. hope and despair, resolved to hold out to the last. They hurried to the Avails to denounce the capitula tion and defy their foes. They reformed their walls, plied their machines, countermining* the miners, attacked them in their mines. As they rallied, the Christian host \u2014 divided, suspicious of one another, sacrificing* instead of supporting each other in partial attacks \u2014 seemed to have changed at once places and character with the besieged. In the meantime the Mussulmans, aroused and united by the danger, assembled from Cairo, Da mascus, and Aleppo. The neAvs of their approach completed the demoralization of the Christian host. The chiefs, to veil and facilitate their own fligiit, published a general assault for the following morn ing, and decamped during* the night. The army, on finding themselves Avithout chiefs, and fearing foes and treachery, disbanded in the Avildest confu sion ; and those who were so lucky as to make good their retreat, neither stopped nor tarried till they found themselves safe within the Avails of Tyre. The forces of the West Avere broken before this little Syrian fort.* I had been looking in vain for traces of the Cru- \u00a9 saders, but could not discover any, excepting* of course in the tOAvns of the coast.

It was at Shim- Ian that I first heard of, and observed, traces of terraceing on elevated parts, which must for many centuries have lain waste and barren. Tebnin is out of the range of the Lebanon. Nor is it against the Crusaders alone that the Lebanon was shut. Alexander made nothing of it. This particularly appears from mention made of successes, Avhatever they may have amounted to, obtained against the Anti-Libanus.* After leaving for \" Hamed the Bey,\" and send ing* to the ladies, such compliments as I should not like to set down on Frank paper, I set forth, accom panied by all the male inmates of the castle down to the village.

Having* been disappointed in seeing* Hamed el Bey, I Avas curious as to what this Metuali chief might be. I did not send before, and determined not to present my letter from Emin Effendi, till after all the little matters Avhich constitute the great concerns of Eastern life Avere settled. I had the advantage of meeting whilst he was in motion \u2014 a great point Avhen ceremonial is unadjusted ; he Avas coming doAvn stairs, so that he, approaching, had to take the initiative. He Avas embarrassed, and I admired the manner in which he got through his difficulties, and very soon could present my letter, Avithout its making any difference. I had regretted in the morning that Walter Scott had not had the opportunity of Avitnessing on another scene, the attempts he has so well described, of poverty to hide its rags, and fallen dignity to deserve, in at least the forms of its hospi tality, its own respect. Here it was another picture. I had left the ruined castle of the Grand Seigneur of Richard II. for the Celtic Tanistry, which has descended nearly to our times. Tamar Bey is remarkably handsome. His fea tures combined the Roman and Greek ideal.

The eye glistening and playful, the air soft but not effeminate. I was charmed with him, and I Avas pleased in watching him, as I did for ten hours, during his intercourse Avith the persons of so different mould who sat aroud his hall. This hall Avas a gaunt vault with a mortar floor and a broad estrade or divan of the same ma terial on three sides, but on which mats or carpets were laid. Close by the corner where he sat, and level Avith the divan, was a hearth on which burnt a brushwood fire. All around crouched the Sheiks, bearded, moustached, shrouded in abbas, accoutred in arms, overshadoAved Avith loAvring* turbans ; all were striking, not one had a trace of beauty, nor did a shade of delicacy by nature or refinement by art, disturb the semblance of Ismaelian and Crusader, but not of troubadour. I broke the long* silence that folloAved my intro duction by the question, \"Have you music here ?\" the reply was \" None ; such things once abounded, but they are gone.\" Some trace of chivalry ap peared in a gauntlet which lay on the estrade ; as I Avas considering it, the purpose was revealed by the fluttering of a hawk, and the gingie of his bells, Avhich in the darkness of the apartment I had nearly SAvept with my sulam from his perch.

The Bey was mutsellim, or governor, and tax-gatherer of nearly a third of Bsharre\". I sat through his ordinary business for three hours. He then addressed himself to me. He had neither the natural faculty of con versation, nor the materials for it ; but his quick apprehension and resources in appropriate words, jus tified the impression he had already made. We fell of course, on Druzes and Hungarians. \" It is strange to see in these parts a person from your lands, though they are very common among* our mountain neighbours.\" He then inquired where I had been among* the Druzes, Avhat chiefs I had seen, what I \u00a9 7 -\u00bb thought of them. He expressed assent to my observations, and then proceeded to say : \" They are brave, but have Aveak minds. They are brought up in secrecy, and cheat Mussulman and Christian, whom they equally hate; profess loyalty to the Sultan, and are ahvays intriguing with strangers.\" I expressed the hope that the Porte Avould send to Beyrout a Pasha who knew Europe, to stop these things, Avhich no nation in Europe desired, and Avhich were no part of the functions of Consuls, Avho Avere only commercial agents. \" The Sultan has been long enduring,\"\u2014 and the subject dropped.

It was resumed by his asking me if the Hungarian matter was ended. I answered that it was so, with a pea left in the Avound. \" How could Russia with draAV after her demand ; she had nothing to learn by the Sultan's answer Avhich she did not know be fore?\" You must know best. \"Perhaps the an- SAver of England and France frightened the Musco- \u00a9 \u00a9 vite?\" Do you think so? \"We know England and France are always Avith Turkey.\" As at Nava rino. \" Well, Avhat do you mean?\" I am looking for your meaning. \" Let them only come and we will see who is now the strongest.\" Would you have marched to the Danube ? \" Yes.\" And hoAV ? \" It matters not ; with the ten thousand muskets of Beled Bsharre, or with one on my single shoulder.\" And therefore you think they did not come. \"Yes.\" I acknoAvledged the compliment paid to my under standing by his laconism ; on which he explained : \" Yes, and every Mussulman Avould have done the same.\" So you think Turkey stronger than she was. The Avhole assembly here answered, \" Stronger and becoming still more strong.\" Then you think you are a match for Russia Avithout us. \" I do.\" Ilhamdulillah. \" Then are you not with us.\" Our people are with you, but the Russians are foxes. \" Then why have you taken our part?\" What have you said just now ? \" You take our part only because"], [353, "339 THE METUALI. we are the strongest.\" You said Russia learnt nothing* by the Sultan's answer, and hoav Avithdraws ; you meant that she did so, because you were the strongest ; did she not know that before ? \" Of course Russia is not blind.\" Why then did she de mand, knoAving Avhat she would get ? why retire, having demanded ? \" Do you knoAv ?\" I think I do. \" Then you think her very foolish.\" No, very wise, nor has she in any thing* shewn more wisdom ; she has not Turkey only to manage ; she does much work in setting up and pulling down kings. In France she had put one recently up ; they made caricatures of him, painting him as a bear's cub. So she makes him step out and say to her, \"How dare you \u2014 hold back\u2014 or I,\" and other big Avords, and then all the people say, \" What a brave prince ; who said he Avas a Muscovite?\" \"Your words are strange, and may therefore be true : we hear of France and England always together ; yet it was France that Avent to Egypt, and it is France that holds Algiers, and France and England are they not noAv troub ling the Mountain, and the friends of the Sultan. Praise be to God Ave do not want such friends.\" The conversation here dropped, and perfect silence ensued for the space of half an hour. The sun was setting, and I was impatient to get out, as the sun set had become to me like a friend's visit at an accustomed hour. The only window to the chamber Avas to the East, and it Avas the reflected light that made its way in ; but I feared to break this stillness. z 2"], [354, "340 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. There was something* in that assembly voiceless and motionless that Avas worth a sunset; and as the waning light fell on the figures on the opposite Avail, or cast shadows from those on the same rank with myself, or shewed against the light the row of scribes who had put by their pens, I could scarcely resist the sense of being in a dream, and seeing in it an entranced assembly around Aroun El Raschid ; or a tomb opened up, Avhose occupants Avere placed in the postures in which they had lived on earth. When a guest enters, those present are not regu lated in their motions by the chief person, but rise according to their respective rank ; last of all he comes up to the chief. After the general Selam Aleikum, as soon as seated, each repeats to him Suble Hair : to a superior he rises again in making his temenas. Thousands of times in the course of the tAventy-four hours must these Avails hear those words ; they even repeat them to those asleep, as I this night Avitnessed. They never miss them on meeting or parting, nor on any occasion for repeat ing them ; going* from one apartment to another, bringing in of light, having* drank water or eaten DO \u00a9 7 \u00a9 supper, &c. The foregoing conversation was at least a dozen times interrupted by the rising of the Avhole party. As supper time approached, my curiosity grew with my appetite. I Avas now at the fountain of knowledge; for that meal must solve for me the enigma. A Turk, whom I found there, all by"], [355, "THE METUALI. 341 himself, and Avho had a house to himself, told me that they do not even taste dishes which had been touched by us (Mussulnans and Christians). I had seen nothing of the sort, and coffee-cups and sherbet glasses Avere in full pratique. At last, I saAV with the corner of my eye a small round table brought in and placed at the further end of the estrade. A servant of my OAvn came to notify that supper Avas ready. I was blind and deaf, pertina ciously so ; he retreated. Again he came, Avith no better success: messages were going and coming, and so passed a quarter of an hour, Avhich I rendered absolutely blank by refusing all conversation. At last the Bey made the formal announcement. I pro tested : I had breakfasted with the Khan before leav ing Tebnin, and could perfectly wait his supper hour. Tamar Bey did sit down to supper Avith me at the little table placed at the end of the room. He, too, gained a victory, for he kept me away from the supper table. The poor Bey Avas not full of appetite, nor were the dishes such as to provoke it. The quality was execrable ; in such cases quan tity is supposed to restore the balance, but quantity was wanting. Two small Italian plates, intended for olives, made their appearance, with each three mouthfuls of scraggy goat's flesh, mixed Avith pulse and green tomatas. After tAvo morsels gulped, the Bey made a sudden retreat ; not to the long table, which in the meantime had been placed in the middle of the hall, but to the Harem ; whence he"], [356, "342 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. did not emerge all that night, nor next day, till long after the time I had fixed for my departure ; but which I postponed, in order, by seeing him again, to take off the edge of the weapon which the habits of his sect had forged, and the inexpertness of his cook had sharpened to my hands. While we were engaged in this tete a tete, a mat had been laid in the middle of the floor ; on this a long table, five or six inches high, had been placed, and, as at a theatre, table, implements, and viands, all came in together, and were instantaneously placed : there Avere the convives, too, all ready squatted round. The time occupied was the thea trical five minutes ; then they were all up and aAvay, the table and mat gone, and all that remained Avas a man sweeping with an enormous broom, and the hawks. Then some came back, and spreading their jackets in a row, made their prostrations, and again departed. In about half an hour, the Bey's court began to fill, and we had again and again the Suble Hair, and the embracing, and the g*ettings 7 \u00a9/ \u00a9 a up. There Avas but underbreath conversation and whispering of the groups along the Avail. The Turk came and took his place by me, all anxiety to knoAv what had happened ; Avhen I said, \" The Bey and I supped together:\" he Avas thunderstruck. Inquiries Avere made for the Bey ; he was comino* : then the barber came to boil Avater, the Bey Avas to be shaved first.

I Avas in the meantime exceedingly tired, having sat up all the previous night writing ; having sat on the hard mortar there through the long hours of that day. I counted off therefore Greybeard and Blackbeard as it gathered up its abba and took its departure. When the last vanished, an attendant brought an armful of satin pilloAvs and gold bro caded coverlids from the harem, and all the house hold assembled to view the rigging* of my anti-flea apparatus ; Avhich Avas of a novel construction, in vented only within the week, and constructed in the ancient city, Avhich has left its name in Eastern lands to sheets, and whose inhabitants first invented the process of undressing when going- to bed (Sidon). Dec. 13th I was ready to start at sunrise, but the Bey not having made his appearance, I sent to say that I could not depart without seeing him, and sat doAvn in his corner, and g*ot my paper and pens. He had expected me to hasten my departure, not to see him. HoAvever, Avhether it Avas the summons sent or the blockade established, he surrendered at discretion. His self-possession Avas g'one, he Avanted to put me in the place of honour : I had to take him by the arm before he would occupy it.

One of his servants, a nice looking lad, came to ask me to take him with me, for he Avished to serve me all his life. The man who accompanied me was handsomely dressed, rode a pretty filly Avorth here \u00a320, performed his duty without familiarity, and when at the end of the day I dismissed him, he was perfectly satisfied with 15 piastres, little more than half what you would pay at Smyrna for a scoundrel of a valet de place.

Sta tionary booths were erecting, the ground Avas yellow with oranges, the road filled for half an hour with animals laden Avith crockery-Avare, mats, abbas, and boxes of haberdashery; such as caps, sashes, ready made trousers, which have the convenience of fitting all sizes, the only measure requisite being* for height. Not a muleteer passed Avho did not give his Suble Hair, many of them draAving up on the road side to salute. After better than tAvo hours travelling* \u00a9 through the broken hills, AA'hich are here in the hollows Avell sprinkled with trees, olive, oak, and some ash, Ave came suddenly out on a deep valley or plain, beyond which unbrokenly rose Gebel Sheik, with a long bank Avhich shoulders him, sweep ing doAvn to the south ; the bank was cut in gullies by the water doAvn to black rock, the verdure was olive green shaded away into brown, the inequalities"], [359, "THE METUALI. 345 on the summit were rugged, two ofthem appearing as craters rising* higher on the southern side. I have before said, that the Lebanon must have been cast up by a recent volcanic irruption ; here one saw the operation distinctly ; the gush of the lava upheaving Gebel Sheik, and then after he had been raised the violence of the internal force subsided, and the surface of the fluid mass cooled and har dened ; then the mountain had settled down, leaving an interval betAveen his calcareous rock and the lava, and then indenting* and pressing* it down. On one of the last cliffs of the Sheik, and immediately op posite to us, I distinguished a fortress of singular appearance ; it crowned the sharp point of a pyramid of great height and regular form. Afterwards, seeing it more in flank, it proved to be a range of which I had seen the sharp edge ; this was Banias, the ancient Panias, the domain of Pan. The plain, which might be ten miles across, was a dead level, smooth as a billiard table, divided off by cul ture into straight lines of yelloAV, green and broAvn, as it was ploughed or not ploughed, or the fresh corn had sprung up. There Avere no trees, and though entirely under the plough, not a village to be seen. On inquiring, I found that it belonged to the roving Arabs ; so in the Avar of camel hair \u00a9 7 ag'ainst stone Avails, the former had gained so much ground, and pushed so far into the land of cities. I saw some of their tents, here called Haimath, on the hill side, merely a black covering stretched over stone walls and bushes."], [360, "346 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. At the bottom of the valley to the south, lay the sources of the Jordan, cut off from the superior waters by a chain of low hills, which seem to form a bridge between the Anti-Lebanon and the Lebanon, on the continuation of which I stood. These up- held, as I found on advancing*, a circular valley called the Merj Ajoun ; it looks like some liquid suddenly rendered solid. The cup in which it is held is a circle of smooth rounded hills, yellow, pale or reddish, the Lebanon limestone. The overflow is to the south ; the northern portion is the highest, and turns off the waters running down from the Bkkaa ; which force their way through the outlyers of the Lebanon to the sea near Tyre. Through the interval of the tAvo chains might be seen Sonin Avhich over- hangs Beyrout, covered with snoAV ; and round to the left the last summits of the Lebanon, seen on edge, amid Avhich I could distinguish the crest of the Gebel Rehan, Avhere I had spent three days Avith the Messaa. I had taken the route which had brought me out on the broAV whence I had obtained this vieAV, by the wish to see some ruins. Close by, was the for tress of Honin, and under it the village of Mais. We had to descend to it, turning to the north ; having dismounted I reached it alone, and found a party of the inhabitants basking in the sun. On the south side of a house, built on a sweep of the rock, they Avere seated, arrayed in the gayest colours, bright green, blue, red, yellow ; not to speak of the"], [361, "347 THE METUALI. gold and silver tissue Avhich bedecks very generally the right shoulder of the abbas, and other parts of the dresses : seated there on the pale rock and illu minated by the sun, they looked like a row of some South American birds, assorted for the con trast of plumage. They rose to meet me, and in vited me to join their assembly : I told them 1 was going to the fortress ; soon after, Avhen the Bey's horseman arrived, the Avhole body folloAved him, and came and squatted round me on one of the battle ments, where I was contemplating the view I have just described. They followed meAvherever I AArent, never obtruding nor even speaking, Avhen I sat doAvn, they stood, until told to be seated ; were ready to do any service, and vanished on a sign. I passed my nargille round, which is not an honour only, but a treat, as they mostly smoke the mixture of tobacco and treacle. With this I made them happy, and they returned contented, after seeing us on our Avay, and wishing us a prosperous journey. It might be supposed that to have a nargille among the rocks, it w'ould be requisite to carry fire and charcoal, but all these things are nicely man aged. They have balls made of pounded charcoal and flour, which can be lighted by putting them, with a piece of lighted amadou and a little tobacco, into a small Avire cup secured by a chain ; this is swung rapidly round the finger ; the tobacco burns from the amadou, and the ball is lighted from the tobacco ; it is then placed on the nargille and burns Avhile it lasts."], [362, "348 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. We now travelled north Avard on the crest or the side of the chain, till Ave came to a narrow valley, formed by it and the cup of the Merj. It is well Avooded and watered, and around a village there Ave found every thing that man could desire\u2014 vines, fig-trees, Avalnuts, oliveS, mulberries, irrigated fields; and dispersed through these the silver poplar, Avhich gives so much sprightliness to a prospect. We noAv ascended the steep side of the hill, and then descended through a grove of olives to a villag*e, Avhere Ave had in front the dark massy rock Avhich bore on its summit the castle of Skiff, separated from us by the river of Casemieh Avhich sweeps round its base but too deep in the ravine to be seen. The village is perched among* the rocks, interspersed Avith all kinds of trees, adorned with the Cactus Opuntia, and forms as beautiful an object, and enjoys as lovely and grand a prospect, as any inhabited spot of earth. The height of the rock, the depth of the gully, and the lowness of the sun, put all thought of visiting- Skiff that night out of the question. I found too that it Avas two hours distant, as the Avater is not fordable, and it is necessary to go round by an ancient bridge ; so I contented myself Avith sitting out the sun on one of the roofs. Indeed he had disappeared behind the cliff on my arrival, and lighted from the other side some corners of the castle, Avhile casting into gloom and darkness the broad mass of rock on Avhich it stood. I then retired to an apartment formed by three Avails and a roof,"], [363, "THE METUALI. 349 the fourth being composed of mats which Avere rolled up or let doAvn at pleasure, the centre one being the doorway. Soon a supper was brought, which might have put to the blush Hamed the Bey, as Avell as the Bey Tamar. The elders congregated round me ** \u00a9 \u00a9 as I supped; and as I noAv Avrite, a dozen sit along the Avails in profound silence ; a word Avould cause them to disappear, but it is their pleasure. While eating*, dressing, undressing, you are always leading a Roman life, at least such as that Roman desired to lead who said, \" Build me a house Avhere I shall be seen by every one every hour of the day.\" No doubt this is very annoying to Europeans ; not only because of the difference of habits, but because they do not knoAv how to get rid of spectators without offending them ; also because the people take liberties Avith them Avhich do become intolerable, as I now found myself, even by having Avith me one servant accustomed to Europeans. Your servant is the fugleman ; their demeanor will be calculated on his ; the first word between a servant and his Frank master removes every restraint. The varieties of the people are like those of the land or the landscape. Here they were Christians, characterised by the reverse of inferiority to their neighbours : curious as to the cause, I inquired if they had domestic industry. Just as a thrifty High land housewife Avould have answered, they replied to me. The Sheik, comprehending the object of my question, added, \" We are not like the Metuali, Avho"], [364, "350 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. have to go far away to Sur, and pay three times the price of what they buy ; we make at home every thing we Avant.\" \" And we dye it too,\" exclaimed a man sitting at his side, and holding up a pair of hands, the cerulean complexion of which, gave colour to his words. I suppose I am a fixture here for to-morrow at least, for a storm came on which rages still, though the night has advanced towards morning."], [365, "351 HASHBAYA AND ITS EMIRS. CHAPTER IX. HASHBAYA AND ITS EMIRS. The storm has ceased, but the rain continues. I am lucky to be in such comfortable quarters. This village contains eighty houses, the male (arm-bear ing) population by the new census is 180. The poll-tax is 16 piastres, they pay 14,000 piastres miri, and furnish 1,900 measures of. barley, of six okes, value one and a half piastres, and 700 measures of corn of eight okes, value two and a half piastres ; the Avhole amounts to about 22,000 piastres, or 270 piastres the fire. The measure of grain is equal to 22 pounds, and this they have for less than sixpence, or one farthing per pound ! Thus, good wheaten bread enough for daily food may be had for a halfpenny, a horse's keep is sixpence : the public tax of \u00a32. 10s a fire Avould therefore re present a sum equal with us to \u00a312. Wages are so high that a man working one day may eat for three. They offer the antithesis to the European system ; there food is dear and man cheap. While recently travelling in Asia Minor, I reached Magnesia very hungry : having outstripped my attendants, I was alone, and went to a common shop, where I had three skevvers of kebab, a much esteemed dish, and"], [366, "352 DIARY IN THE LHBANON. the best of the kind I ever tasted, a yuf ka someAvhat resembling\" Yorkshire pudding, a large lump of ice in the jar of water, a dish of yaourt, a bunch of grapes, and afterwards a caimac (cream) ice. The ice would not be exactly to our taste ; it was their cream, iced ; all was excellent ; a common field la bourer might, if he chose so to spend his money, have had four such meals a day for his day's wages ; the charge Avas as follows : \u2014 Paras. Ice for water . . .5 Kebab and yufka . . .25 Youart . . . .30 Grapes . . . .5 Cream ice . . . .20 85 That is, two piastres and five paras, about 4^-i. The field labourers Avere then receiving from 8 to 10 piastres a day. They have tobacco at 2d per lb. instead of the 8s that our labouring* classes pay ; coffee and sugar, if they like, at a lower rate, though they come from our colonies, while the luxuries, within reach of the wealthy only with us, are open to all ; to say nothing of luxuries which no European monarch knoAvs, in the bath, shampooing, and the courtesies of common life. When assailed by such expressions as, \" Oh, that this country were in your hands !\" \" What would this country be in the hands of the French or English !\" I have contented myself with instancing* my bill of"], [367, "HASHBAYA AND ITS EMIRS. 353 fare at Magnesia, and mentioning the price of bread and the amount of Avages in England and France ; and I have found that little round of statistics to produce a considerable effect in clearing the political atmosphere. In the morning it rained, but the day having cleared up, I ventured to sally forth for the castle, the horses to wait at the bridge. I descended to the hollow of the stream, saAv the bridge higher up the valley, but in passing near the castle, that is as near as one could to a building on a cliff 400 feet high, I perceived that it was modern ; there was no inferior layer of huge stones, the toAver and arches of the interior Avere exposed, and looked so middle-age-like that I Avavered. HoAvever, after crossing the bridge, I tied my horse to a tree, and proceeded on foot, taking* the path Avhich Avound round the back or the west of the cliff. When I reached the summit, a mass of black clouds greeted me with some drops of rain, so I beat a hurried retreat. We travelled over the hills that form the cup of the Merj to its northern extremity, where is situated the village of Jedeide ; the rain being heavy, Ave attempted to gain admittance, but Avere everyAvhere repulsed ; and as it Avas but two hours to Hashbaya we shook off the mud ag*ainst the inhospitable place ; and, leaving- the cup of the Merj? Ave descended into a pretty valley, through Avhich the Avater Aoaas to the south into the Jordan, finding its way to the east of the Merj, as the Thany does 2 A"], [368, "354 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. to the west. By the waiter stood a handsome khan, but noAv in ruins ; we folloAved the course of the water for three or four miles, then struck into the hills on the right, scrambling among* rocks and olive trees till we got right between the cheeks of two hills ; Ave reached Hashbaya as it fell dark. The rain tells its tale upon these towns and villages, and this one was nestled among rocks ; it was hard work to get to \" the serai,\" the walls of which looked indeed imposing in the gloom. I Avas surrounded by a number of idlers, who speculated much on my ori ginal nature, whilst I sent up to the Emir to say that a stranger asked for hospitality. I had a Bu yourdi from the Pasha, but I did not choose to use it. As the servant was long* in returning*, I felt rather uncertain as to how I Avas to pass the night. I wronged hoAvever the Arab in his nature ; the ansAver came that he was unwell, and had leeches on, but that he had ordered an apartment to be prepared. Immediately on entering supper was served. It was homely but abundant ; it was real hospitality that looked to the hunger, not the daintiness of the guest. Soon, however, a message was brought by a superior officer, in a different tone, praying excuses. This personage's report seemed to have been favour able, and brought the son of the Emir again to apo logise ; forcing on me the place of honour, and sa luting after the coffee. The room then filled with the gentry of the place, to the number of thirty ; among whom were tAvo other sons of the Emir, handsome boys, whilst the eldest, about twenty, filled his"], [369, "HASHBAYA AND ITS EMIRS. 355 father's place with the tact of age and the sprightli ness of youth. He begged me to abstain from the, no doubt onerous, ceremonial ; but I felt it my duty to make a sacrifice, in consideration that I had to redeem the shortcomings of other travellers, who may have all the good will possible, but who do not know hoAV. They Avere much excited about the census, and dreaded to be taken as soldiers ; they had the most extravagant and absurd notions on the subject ; and I was requested, after correcting* a few mistakes, to explain the matter to them. Having done so, they expressed themselves well satisfied, and only feared that it might fail in execution. \u00a9 As I had expressed a Avish to go to the bath, the young Emir told me he had ordered it to be got ready ; and saying he did not Avish to oppress me that night, \" asked leave,\" and his troop, including* all ages from ten to ninety, rose simultaneously and hurried, as is their Avont, from the apartment, not to give the trouble of standing to return their salutation. Adventitious circumstances might account else where for amiable hospitality ; here there was none : Avhat then changed a shelter and a supper, into a reception? There Avas Lady Hester Stanhope, eccentric, if not more, Avithout knowledge of the Arabic, with very slender means, yet she possessed in this country control over its princes and people, which made her be treated almost on a footing of equality, by the rulers of the land. But it must not 2 a 2"], [370, "356 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. be supposed that it is a light thing to acquire this poAver : to learn manners, is not easy for the grown man. Lady Mary Wortley Montague seems to have had an intuitive gift, Lady Hester Stanhope great originality, and the experience of the best times and society of Europe. Sir John McNeil had an analytical mind ; Mr. Lane microscopic observation, and laborious perseverance. These are the only persons belonging to our country, of whom I have knowledge, who have possessed that key in the East \" to the hearts of men\" which Bacon com memorates ; yet may it be attained by ordinary persons : on two conditions hoAvever. Speaking as I do from my OAvn experience, I have confidence in announcing them :\u2014 first, unreasoning study ; and afterwards assiduous care. Once fail and the jar is broken ; fail in one item, and the rest goes for nothing. The requisites are constant study of per sons, appreciation of their character and position, exact memory, and a sense of this as the thing of major and paramount importance. Once entered upon this course, it increases the interest of mere travel, just as the knoAvledge of geology does of scenery; independently of the chances of finding mines of gold and treasures of gems, in the mud trodden by others under foot. England has been peculiarly fortunate in this line. I cannot recall to mind one single person belono-ino to the continent of Europe who has at all ventured upon it. I know indeed of the existence of one"], [371, "HASHBAYA AND ITS EMIRS. 357 Frenchman, though I am not acquainted with his name ; nor has he left behind him any thing tangible or permanent, save the impressions of himself. 1 learnt the circumstance in so interesting a manner, and it is so illustrative of Avhat I have engaged to describe, \u00a9 O 7 that I will record it. Some years ago at a dinner in London the folloAV ing anecdote was told : \u2014 The embassy of General Gardanne, Avhich Avas to prepare Persia to unite with France for the inva- sion of India, must have been composed with equal care in the selection of the persons as Avith magni- ficence in the numbers of which it Avas composed, their rank, and expenditure. The peculiar talent of Napoleon was judgment of men : he had himself in the East imitated Alexander in his assumption of Persian manners. If anything* could have con- tributed to the success of his Indian scheme, it was the character of the men so chosen, and nothing- more than the choice he made could afford the test of his poAvers. Well, this embassy miserably failed, and with it the Indian expedition. Of all the pre eminent men whom it included, not a trace remains in Persia, while the name of a second Lieutenant of Engineers has survived, and will survive for \u00a9 7 centuries. The incident had been quoted to sheAv that the Persians could discriminate as to the man, and disregard the station ; but as the narrative pro ceeded, another of the guests, beside avIioiii I Avas"], [372, "358 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. seated, continued to whisper, \"Hoav extraordi nary !\" When the narrator had concluded, taking up the thread, the other continued in these terms : \" When the embassy returned, my brother was in Spain (such is my recollection), and it repaired thither, as I did also. He himself saw, and ques tioned every member of that embassy, being exces sively incensed at its failure. I had just arrived, and speaking of it, he said to me, \" In that embassy there is but one man,\" mentioning his name, \" I shall make him soon, if he stands the test, a mar shal of France.\" To the inquiry, \" What has become of him ?\" \u2014 the Prince of Canino answered, \" He was killed that night.\" It is thirteen years since this conversation oc curred. I may not be precise in some of the incidents, but the substance is there, and the reflec tion to which it gave rise, and to Avhich I gave utterance at the time, Avas, that the genius of Napoleon in its highest exercise Avas but a return to, and a concurrence Avith, the simplicity of nature, as still found undisturbed in the peasant of the East, a polished but unlettered man. Here the door stands ever wide ; all classes mix together. Were there, as with us, distinctions of grade according to politeness, they Avould soon settle by this free intercourse to the loAvest level ; but as all are equally polished, by politeness, not by doors and Avails, the grades of society are preserved. With our manners, this country Avould sink into the"], [373, "HASHBAYA AND ITS EMIRS. 359 veriest kennel, or they Avould of necessity be forced to adopt, as we have done, seclusion ; converting one people into a variety of reciprocally unknown and mutually hating races. Johnson has not ad mitted the Avord civilization into his Dictionary of the English tongue : we know from BosAvell that he abhorred it ; first, because it was a nonentity ; and secondly, because it Avas a false substitute for civility. To a European, the forms of this country are an intolerable burden ; to an Eastern, the habits of ours are sometimes peculiarly attractive Avhen least capable of extenuation. I one day heard Emin Effendi, after some domestic annoyance, holding forth to Izzet Pasha on that admirable part of European society \u2014 servants. He expatiated on their docility, alertness, dexterity ; contrasting there- Avith the stubbornness, loquacity, and impudence of Turkish retainers. Above all, he Avas in extasy at the ease Avith Avhich they could be got rid of. Having overheard all this unobserved, and enjoying the grave face with which the Pasha took it in, I entered, as a bull a china shop. Poor Emin Effendi was presently picking up, and trying to fit his broken crockery, to the great amusement of the Pasha, Avho had been very unwilling to believe, though unable to gainsay. A Avord attributed to the Duke of Wellington, on the occasion of some appre hended insurrection, proved a sledge-hammer in this onslaught, \" Nowadays, no gentleman can trust his butler.\""], [374, "DIARY IN THE LEBANON. 360 As I concluded writing the foregoing sentence, the Emir, unannounced and unattended, lifted the curtain, and entered. I recognised him by the likeness to his son. He attempted to treat me as his son had done. I was giving utterance to my embarrassment and shame by his treating me above my deserts, when he pointed to the maps and books around me, and said, \" What are we, ignorant men, before you, Avho are endowed Avith science, and Avho honour us by visiting us in our rocks and dens.\" \" I wish,\" I ansAvered, \" that you had some of our science, but much more, that Ave had somewhat of yonr ignorance. Twice has the torch of science been held by an Arab hand when the world was dark.\" \" When ?\" said he. \" Once, by the Ph\u0153ni cians, at the beginning of time ; once, by the Sara cens, after the old things had passed away.\" This led to a conversation on Arabic literature, in Avhich two of those present very intelligently took part, and after I had not reluctantly yielded to his request, that I should remain that day with him, the party got up and took their leave. But it Avas rather Avith me that he spent the day ; for the meetings and meals were in the apartment allotted to me, and the servants came to me for orders ; and, Avhen I declined, Avould take no refusal \u2014 the Emir Avas nobody. It was the story of the entranced beggar of the Arabian Nights. I Avas too much interested and occupied with the family, which in numbers is truly patriarchal \u2014 though the attendants took care to tell me that the"], [375, "361 HASHBAYA AND ITS EMIRS. Emir had but one Avife \u2014 with the cousins, and the still young generation, of Avhich there were two, all glittering in gold coin, ornaments and jeAvels, to ask for those things which chiefly interest travellers ; and, unless I had been told of and taken to see it, I should have missed the finest piece of ornamental arabesque that I have yet seen ; and still more re markable in its emblematic than in its architectural character. It was not a ruin of the times of the Kaliffs, and owned no Abbaside, no Omuiade, no Fatimite for its author. It Avas part of the dAvel ling of the present family, constructed by the great grand-uncle of the present Emir, 75 years ago, and still used by them. The serai is grandiose, but built upon or repaired with mean workmanship. The courts are filthy ; the Avails dilapidated. As the young* Emir con ducted me up some flights of stairs, I Avas little pre pared in coming upon the roof, to behold what appeared a portal only. There Avas no opening ; an arch with a flat Avail beyond. The arch Saracenic, and the Avhole in encrusted marble or wrought stone of the variegated hues of the Mountain, all complete and exquisite. My conductor said, \" There is no thing false here,\" meaning no plaster or paint. The first impression is that it must be painted, so much care has been taken in selecting the stones of uni form and bright colours. Hoav shall I describe it ? It was neither a hall, a facade, a tower, nor a gateAvay. It Avas a marble imitation of one of those gorgeous tents of the time"], [376, "362 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. of Soliman the Magnificent, which I have seen at Constantinople, Avith a back and scroll roof only, to be placed on some eminence commanding a prospect, and where for an hour shade Avas required. The roof on which Ave stood was an oblong, para petted round ; at one of the narrower ends, the Avail rose about 50 feet, the Avidth being about the same. In the thickness of this Avail there Avas a horse-shoe arch occupied below by a divan, and steps ascend ing to it. At the sides Avere tAvo recesses with windows, and a small staircase leading up to cham bers constructed in the wall. There is a hollow left in the moulding*s of the inner arch, with a round orifice at each spring*, Avhich they told me gave an agreeable echo Avhen music was played in front. It was the gate of the city reared on a terrace, the place of meeting for the Elders, the seat of justice, in a Avord \" the Porte.\" Afterwards the young* Emir came to sup with me, and I told him that I admired \" the room,\" as he called it, more since I did not see it than when I did ; then I only saAV its stones, now I read its poetry. This I had to explain by \" the Elders sit ting at the Gate,\" \" the Golden Gate,\" &c. typifying the tAvo great virtues of Hospitality and Justice. That the idea of constructing an apartment in that form, consecrating to it all that was capable of being ornamental, executing it with such taste, and placing it so under the heavens, gave me the history and character of his great-grand-uncle, just as Ibtedee"], [377, "363 HASHBAYA AND ITS EMIRS. gave me that of Emir Beshir. He ansAvered, \" You are right. He Avas a just and a hospitable man and a great governor ; he Avas chief of all this country till Emir Jusuff, the uncle of Emir Beshir, killed him and reigned in his stead.\" I inquired hoAv Emir Beshir had not come to see this \" gate'' before he built his Palace. He told me that he had come, but could not find Avorkmen to make the like ; but that part of the palace of Ibtedeen is a copy of this. So far it is true, for the inner en trance is copied from it, only it is such a copy as such a man Avould make. This place contains 1200 houses. The only indus try in the Charchee was silk Avinding* and dyeing. Formerly, there Avere many looms for Kefiehs, and silk and cotton stuffs, which now they receive from Damascus ; which, too, Avithin the last ten years has fallen off to the amount of tAvo-thirds of its looms. French silk, aud English cotton imitations, supply ing* the place. The Charchee, poor as it Avas, offered resources to one in Avant of necessaries for the road. It is formed of a series of arches, as if a colonnade Avere divided off into shops. There are here five populations, and there is a village near of Nussarieh (Nosaii i). I asked the young* Emir if he Avould not like to visit Europe. His younger brother inter posed, \" You take all our money, and we have none left to enable us to go to visit you.\" The idea so prevalent on the continent of Europe, of the op pression of England's commerce, I find every"], [378, "364 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. where here, and with reason. The people, attracted to the shops by gaudy colours and apparent cheap- ness, lose their taste and their money ; their cos- tume is tampered with, their habits of industry destroyed. Instead of converting on the spot their cotton and silk into stuffs, occupying thereby their leisure hours, and thus clothing* themselves at no cost, except dye stuffs and the machinery ; they go to market with so much more raAV material ; Avhilst the spare time becomes Avorse than spare. I will cite one instance, close to Smyrna, and within the range of the observations of Europeans, Magnesia. Every class there complained of decay. It was not the Government ; there were no neAV abuses ; on the contrary they Avere better off. It was not neAV taxes ; on the contrary, they paid less. But for- merly there Avere in the houses of the toAvn and the villages round, 14,000 looms; noAv there are not 200. What in such a state of things must be the result of a tariff which establishes a distinction be tween exportation and importation, To discourage the first and to encourage the second ; sinking the first with prohibitory duties, and leaving on the other duties, such as in Europe Avould be considered to constitute an entirely free and untaxed trade. I was here interrupted, perhaps fortunately, for the subject is one which hourly weighs upon me, by the entrance of the Emirs and Sheiks. It was the second son who to-night led the cortege, which Avas twice as numerous as on the former occasion. After"], [379, "365 HASHBAYA AND ITS EMIRS. the divans were filled, the floor was occupied, and there appeared a throng outside. The second son is the floAver of the family. It Avas he Avho in the morning had spoken of the drain on the country by our trade. He noAv led the conversation up the rugged steeps of political economy ; then Avent to Egypt for illustration of evil measures ; thence to Algiers, inquiring Avhat chance the French had of maintaining their ground ; and entering on the other topics, which the name of that place suggests to every true Mussulman. Then came the affair of the Hungarians. In answer to their questions, I asked whether they thought the Sultan ought to give up the refugees or go to Avar ? They said, he should not give up the refugees. I inquired Avhether they were all of that mind. They all agreed. I then asked if they Avould have been ready to fight had there been the necessity, to Avhich they all assented : I then told them that the matter was settled by the Sultan's refusing* to give them up, and without fighting*, because they Avere all of that mind. I then said that I Avould tell them what the Sultan had said when first informed that such a demand Avas to be made. They all bent forward ; and when they had heard the words, a burst of admiration folloAved, and they re-echoed the last sentence, \" Sooner let the Empire perish.\" Dec. 15th. \u2014 Last night I Avas lulled to sleep by the tinkling of the Aoud, and the choruses of voices which at times droAvned it. Before the music began,"], [380, "366 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. there had been aloud reciting* of prayer, so that this family is Mussulman! I heard the most excellent character of the Emir in as far as I could make inquiries, and I wish Turkey had a thousand such. Here is a case of the Porte, clothing with its authority the feudal chief, without having destroyed the invisible but all powerful restraint of old man ners ; which does not appear in books, and is not comprehended by philosophers, but which has been in all time the prop and stay of those societies av!io have been great without laAVS, and just without philosophy. Hashbaya pays 150,000 piastres per annum. There are 600 houses of Christians, and 100 JeAVS, who besides pay charatch, Avhich may amount to 20,000 piastres more ; which Avould give an average a little above \u00a3l per fire. This morning I left by sunrise, and Avithout see ing any of the family ; we descended to the Waddy Teim, and worked our way to the northward. The valley is separated from the Bkkaa by a narroAv ridge or hogs-back, a miniature in the style of the Lebanon. We reached in six hours its watershed at a village called Maite. The country had just assumed a singular aspect. A burst of volcanic matter had come up to the surface which, peeling like onions, left rounded masses, which Avere picked off, to leave parts fit for culture ; and instead of being built in walls to support the earth, Avere laid in heaps. The land had recently been soavii, and"], [381, "HASHBAYA AND ITS EMIRS. 367 was a light green ; the stones Avere g'rey or brown Avith a tinge of purple. To the left, the limestone assumed the appearance of little pinnacles, and being just ploughed all round, the dark reddish brown earth appeared, making a sort of chintz pattern with the grey. There Avere clouds passing over, and the dark spots so shadowed, looked black. The whole was indistinct and gloomy. On attaining the eleva tion of the village a change came over the prospect. The hills Avere earth, and so steep as to be nearly bare of verdure. The colour Avas light, in parts quite Avhite ; the green of the neAV sown fields was pale, the rest Avas stone colour, or pink, very pale. The sky, deep over head, was, towards the horizon, as pale and transparent a blue as Avere the fields a green. The sun behind us shone out and made the landscape shine with the splendour of a first coating of light colour laid on the canvass. At this village the people Avere loud in their complaints. There were about 20 houses remaining from more than double the number. They had hitherto paid 6000 piastres, besides corn, and 12,000 were now de manded. They were besides in debt, and the people had fled, some to Hasbaya, some to the Hauran. They Avere under Mustafa Bey, the Mutzelim of the Bkkaa, whose district extends 10 hours by 6, and comprehends 50 villages and 20,000 souls. They gave us excellent grapes, which they told us were the last. They were brought from a village half au hour distant called Raket ; but I should have"], [382, "368 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. thought it was vintage time. I met not less than 30 asses, carrying loads of grapes, or going Avith boxes for them. Some one has said, that no one for the last time performs the most insignificant act without pain. I ate these grapes, which by their account Avas to be the last for the year, with infinite pleasure. In three hours more I reached Hammara. It Avas a little off the road on the right, and a little before a break in the Jebel Arbi shewed me the Bkkaa. On reaching the village, I had a view of it spreading before me, right into the roots of the Sonin ; Avhose summit, like a succession of waves, and Avhose side, like a congregation of pyramids, or mamelons, was covered with suoav ; as also Gebel Hirmel farther still to the north. The evening Avas bright but cold, and I anticipated a piercing day on the morrow in crossing the range. Opposite Ham mara was Aite, where the pottery is made, in the same range as the vine-growing villages, and along the circle of hills of aluminous shale. This is the third time that I have fallen on the name of the Hittites, and left in a manner which marks an expelled people seeking refuge. The name Avould descend from the race to the spot, and the title of the nation become the name of the village. \u00a9 I reached the village alone, and wandering throuo-h its dilapidated Avails in search not of a hostelrie but of a host, I heard shouts in Turkish of \" this way ! this way !\" and turning to the voice, saw on a roof an"], [383, "HASHBAYA AND ITS EMIRS. 369 old man Avith floAving* Avhite beard, enormous white turban, and wrapped in a Avhite abbas ; the very impersonation of winter, waving me with the cheer fulness of summer, the way to the entrance of his house. Having reached the terrace, he spread out a corner of his abbas for me to sit on, called for coffee and nargille, and, \"patting me on the back, asked me in broken Turkish, Avhere I should have been by this time if he had not called to me. On finding out that I was a Frank, he said, \"This country Avas yours (referring to the Crusades) before; it is now mine, and so it is yours again.\" A blaz ing fire was not an unwelcome sight, and we sat \u00a9 D 7 chatting as best Ave might, till supper arrived. I had begun to study Arabic, and having thus got a small stock of words, he was able to add to their number, and volunteered, if I AA'ould stay Avith him fifteen days, to make me pass current Avithout in terpreter. Supper Avas brought for me alone, he having vanished ; but on my sending to say he had carried off my appetite, he returned with it. He confirmed all I had heard at Maite, and de scribed this village as in the same condition. Last year more grain had been exacted than was ga thered ; they had borroAved up to 46,000 piastres to meet the demand. Many had fled ; their fields were uncultivated, and he did not know what was to be done. They had petitioned to be included in the Messaa, and he, for presenting the petition, had been thrown into prison ; the Sultan wished well to them 2 B"], [384, "370 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. and sent orders ; but he must send men. He told me, ho av ever, that Mustafa Bey had been changed, and another appointed in his place ; whom I should meet at the first village I should pass through to morroAV morning. We were up before the bay broke, and Avith the first daAvn were setting* forth, as Ave had slept in a sort of outhouse, without disturbing the slumbers of my host. The Sheik heard us get up, and insisted on making coffee himself, which he brought me after I had got on horseback. The Bkkaa noAv opened before us as we advanced slanting into it ; but I was abstracted from the earth by the heavens. The fore foot of the Anti-Lebanon shut out the eastern horizon on the left ; but over it, as the day broke, the clouds became of that red fiery glow which in dicates the spot of a large conflagration. They then appeared as if they were the smoke issuing from a volcano, or rather the eruption ascending* and scat tering on both sides. This was but the accidental distribution of the clouds, standing like a tree on the eastern side, and lighted from below. But to the west a coincident phenomenon, the converse of that I have before described of a rising sun at sunset, appeared. To the point opposite the sun the rays converged, as if they emanated from him, eoveriug* the heavens with alternate streaks of pink and blue, with an interval of purple. It reminded me of the Aurora Borealis ; with the difference that the colour Avas permanent, and not by vibration ; and that, in-"], [385, "HASHBAYA AND ITS EMIRS. 371 stead of one colour three were intermixed. Before me Avere the two long hog-back mountains, Sonin and Jurd, with their bristly backs covered with snoAV. The first, sloping more to the west, was cold, and its Avhite serrated crest Avas thrown out by the illu- minated sky ; but Jurd, facing the east, Avas dappled Avith the rosy fingers of morn even before the sun himself appeared on the scene. He came not to embellish. As I Avatched one part of the heavens, the tints disappeared ; I turned to another, the radia- tion had vanished. The picture lasted about a quarter of an hour, and Avas succeeded by one of the most common place and dismal of sunrises, the heaA'ens being shrouded in mist, Avhich indeed Avas thin and high, and Avhich lasted all the day. About 2 o'clock in the afternoon, from the top of the Le banon, I again observed the phenomenon of a double radiation, Avhich I attributed to the elevation on which I stood, producing* the same effect as that of the sun dipping behind the horizon. Two hours brought me to Bir Elias (fountain of Elijah), on the extremity of the ridge of Arbi, Avhich separates the valley I have been travelling in from the Bkkaa. On an eminence overhanging it stood a ruin, Avhich I imagined must be part of a temple, formed of large blocks. This supposition Avas soon confirmed by fragments of cornices and marble columns of enormous dimensions, Avhich had rolled doAvn ; one of them was five feet in diameter. I should not have failed to visit it, but that I was 2 B 2"], [386, "372 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. pressing on to cross the Lebanon, having been told that it Avas impassable in rain and for some days after it ; we had had fine Aveather the last few days, and it seemed iioav on the change. The Bkkaa looks like a lake, and the mountains seem to rise from the Avater. An outlyer of the Arbi before me, seemed the stern of a foundering vessel ; the parallel layers of the limestone imitating in their dip the lines of a ship's sheer, those of the escarpment gave the transom and stern. The plain is rich alluvial soil, Avhich seems to have been originally de posited 20 or 30 feet higher, from hillocks left here and there, as if the remainder had been washed away by some cataclysm. As we opened upon it, stretching* far north and south, unbroken by hedge, ditch or tree, with the Sonin on the other side ascend ing to its snowy ridge by a succession of pyramids, I acknoAvledged it as one of the kindliest Avorks of na ture, and one of the most desirable of the habitations of man. This Avas the C\u0153lo-Syria of the ancients, which they enjoyed, celebrated, and adorned. The circumstances I have adverted to, of a removal of the surface of the soil to the extent of at least 20 feet, may account for its being destitute of traces of ancient cities. Those Avhich subsist, as Baalbec, are on the rising ground and higher up, Avhere the rush of Avaters had less power. The smoke rose not through the heavy air, and from each of the villages spread to leeward a long line of pale blue, Avhich appeared like so many lakes. At the corner of"], [387, "HASHBAYA AND ITS EMIRS. 373 Gebel Arbi we met the head of a caravan, which could be traced in a long line half across the plain. They Avere going to Damascus. I was wonderfully tempted to turn my horse's head in the same direc tion, and sat for a few minutes irresolute, till the reflection that a fall of siioav might shut me up for a month or more, decided me to continue my course ; not, hoAvever, Avithout the sense of a cat's back stroked the wrong* way, as each mule paced by me, or camel's heads surged in the opposite direction. Then I thought that at least I might strike, up the Bkkaa and visit Baalbec, Avhich was not tAventy miles off; but the suggestion was overruled, and I pro ceeded, tenax propositi, not having* been directed by the sortes Virgilian\u00e6, but by the Horatian verse \u2014 when, lo ! on the elevated croAvn of a field, not a hundred yards distant, stood a real Maurus ; he had no javelin, but a long carbine slung* over his shoulder, and Avas mounted on a white charger, whose forefeet rested on the top of the mound. The Moor wore a red bournous and a dark kefieh wrapped round the head, with a heaA-y blue tassel to his cap; and as he stood against the sky, was a figure to make a tyro pull out the pencil, and a Bellini throw away his brush. The Moor was evi dently Avatching me; Avhen I came abreast of him he hailed me ; but it Avas not to send me to Damas cus or Baalbec, but only to inquire if I had seen or heard of Mustafa the Mutzellim, for whom he was on the Avatch."], [388, "374 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. On the first rise of the Gebel Sonin across the plain, appeared an important town which I took for Zackle. Two hours at a good pace brought us to it, passing a large village on the western side of the river. But the town, as we approached, descended also to a village, which we reached through groves of mulberry trees, poplars, and willows ; water gush ing in all directions, accompanied by the drone of the horizontal mill. This Avas Mallacca ; but Zackle was in the gorge within ; and we reached it in a quarter of an hour, terraced around and perched on both sides of the broken broAvs overhanging the winding* course of a mountain torrent. The bottom was planted thick with poplars, and the terraces above seemed chiefly devoted to the vine. We were welcomed with the brazen tones of the horn from across the gully, where were pitched some green tents of the Nizam ; and by the clangour of not very harmonious bells, from the principal body of the place, Avhich SAvept in a theatre before us to the right. Zackle has a style of its own. The limestone blocks here give place, in a great degree, to clay plastered walls, which, from the contrast, Avere very comfortable to look at. The tops of the houses, instead of being flush like a box or a cube, had a ledge or projection all round, which, while adding to the air of comfort, improved the picturesque. I had been directed to a Sheik ; but, after with great difficulty finding the house, he was absent."], [389, "375 HASHBAYA AND ITS EMIRS. I suppose I spent au hour in getting a place at which to rest, Avhich I did ultimately at the abode of the agent of Emir Hydar, Caimacan of the Maronites, who gave me coffee and nargille, and breakfast, and a man to set me on my Avay. I have been in many filthy and miry places, but never in such a one as this. You plash all the way Avhere you do not stumble, through a channel of mire up to the horse's knees. There are raised trottoirs at the side, which necessity has put them on inventing, on which you see the foot-passengers pushing their precarious way along, holding by the houses or by one another. They have another invention which adds to the burlesque. They do not Avalk about in boots or shoes, or even galoshes, but on high wooden pattens, such as are worn in the bath or by the women in the lower parts of the houses. These they slip on Avithout shoes over their mests, or leathern mittens for the foot, so that they are ready to step on the seat of a shop or into a room without pulling* off boots or shoes. Notwithstanding the mire, I liked the place. There was an activity of life, that contrasted with the congregation of tombs I had lately been hearing called by the names of cities ai.d villages. Every open door exhibited some work in proo-ress \u2014 the anvil, the loom, the distaff. There was an abundant supply of all necessaries and luxu- ries. Magnificent sheep hung in the shambles, gigantic cabbages and grapes, large, clear, and clean, as if just selected from the vintage, or gathered from"], [390, "376 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. a canvass of Van Eke. The people, too, Avere a fine race. I had from Skiff observed the blue bands on the heads of the Avomen ; very generally the kefieh on that of the men ; if not entirely blue it Avas blue 7 %/ mixed Avith white, or Avhite and red. Sometimes you saw men and Avomen entirely in blue from head to foot ; and the other colours, when used, were white and red. The blue was the \" true blue,\" that rich colour, brilliant in its depth, so difficult to hit on, so beautiful Avhen obtained, that the highest of epithets is appended to it. We at least do not speak of \"true yelloAV \" or \"true red.\" There was here none of the miserable purple by Avhich lowland and Saxon dyers have polluted our tartans. I Avas not here precisely in Judea ; Dan itself was beyond the opposite mountains. But there was no mis taking here the laAV of Horeb, and the strife of the children of Heber and Saba ; both by the blue that they kneAV how to dye, and the yelloAV that they choose not to wear \u2014 even to this day."], [391, "THE HOUSE AND HOUSEHOLD. 377 CHAPTER X. THE HOUSE AND THE HOUSEHOLD. From Zackle the ascent of the Lebanon is in a south-Avesterly direction, so that I made a bend round. I had hurried on in the morning' in order to get over this day, and leaving Zackle an hour before midday, that is Avith six hours daylight before me, I thought I had ample time for an ascent of eight or nine miles, which I proposed to attempt on foot. The day was exactly fitted for such a walk ; clouded, but the clouds high, so as not to intercept the view ; nor can I call it clouded, there was a thin and lofty canopy of haze. As we ascended, the Anti- Lebanon, on the other side of the Bkkaa, seemed also to ascend. Its level summit, as far as it could be seen up the valley to the north, being covered with siiOAV, which, skipping over a depressed portion of the chain immediately opposite, lay thickly on Gebel Sheik ; Avhich looked from here like a de pressed Mount Blanc. As we approached the region of snow, its scent came toAvards us without its chill. The day Avas like a May day with us, in the plain"], [392, "378 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. below it Avas July. I loitered from headland to headland, and reluctantly quitted a broAV where I had sat down. A muleteer, who saw my disinclination to depart, described the scene as I could not. \" It opens,\" said he, \" the heart.\" This is the season for travelling in this country. In summer there would be the overpowering heat ; the verdure would have vanished from the plains, the siioav from the mountains. All those contrasts which occupy, and those effects which charm at present, could not be so much as imagined. There is indeed the incon venience of a storm, but that is of little moment ; at least I have found it so, and, excepting on such oc casions, it is summer weather you enjoy. As I sat doAvn on the cliff, which I had so little inclination to leave, everything* breathed of summer. The work in the fields, the tinkling of the bells of the broAv sing goats, the song of girls and Avomen, as in thick succession, the groups appeared scrambling up or springing doAvn the precipices ; for the road during* the early part of the day was thronged with people and mules. And lastly, to croAvn the image of summer, 1 stopped a mule laden with grapes, and got such a bunch as Joshua may have carried to Moses, as a specimen of the chosen land. It is only in winter that the colouring of the earth and rocks can be observed with advantage. This is the soav ing time, so the fields being turned up you see the true colour of the earth. The fields already sown"], [393, "379 THE HOUSE AND HOUSEHOLD. are covered with a sea-green verdure, Avhich brings them out. Here, in the rocks, you look for the same varieties of hue as elsewhere in the heavens ; there is, with the exception of blue, all the tints of the rain bow, and any piece of landscape would require at least 12,000 out of the 18,000 tints and shades used in mosaic Avork. Imagine a field of realger, and a D O 7 rock beside it of orpiment, and then a gully of lake, and then a falaise of gamboge. The summit of the pass was so sharp, that as you turned away from the Bkkaa you came in sight of the sea. But, from the haze, the line of the horizon Avas indistinct, and could not be made out ; so the impression was of a sudden falling away of the earth. ToAvards the summit, the sandstone in juxta position with the lava was burnt and scorched ; there Avere fragments resembling scoria, also a pud dingstone, and under the sandstone, the coarse oolite I had observed at Gebel Rehan. The snow powdered on these formations, brought out the pa rallel lines. A crest to the south of us, sheAved its cuttings so distinctly, that it looked like a mould of differently coloured jellies. Soon after crossing the summit Ave came among the grey limestock rock, but in a new fashion ; a sheet of it beloAV me, lying horizontally and about ten feet in thickness, was broken oft* at right angles so as to look like the spicul\u00e6 of an artichoke, laid layer above layer. The imagination may build up the sort of cliffs, preci pices and gorges, 1500 feet thick, through which"], [394, "380 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. we had to descend. The fragments, moderate as rocks, always called up the idea of human builders of the Titan and Cyclopic breed. There was some times levels of these lines stretching beyond one another, and seen through the gaps and interstices of the first ; or there were solitary fragments left standing like columns. On the opposite hill, the ledges stretched far aAvay, and on them might be traced here and there the picturesque cottages, with projecting eaves, something* resembling those of SAvitzerland. From a dilapidated slope of this wreck, Ave dived through a steep sort of staircase into a narroAV gorge, Avhich, winding to the west, soon afforded a prospect of escape ; the vieAV was, hoAvever, bounded by a dark field of pines^the edge presenting against the horizon a regular fringe, from the bush of the tree being* at the top of the lofty stem. There was a stream at the bottom of the gully on our right, dancing by a succession of waterfalls over the ledges ; it could not have taken less than a hundred leaps to reach the bottom. I counted thirty at once in sight. The night Avas fast closing in, the grey horror of the rocks had not been enlivened by one playful ray ; the grey gloom of the heavens sent back the eye to the indistinct chaos around. The day, unlike her Avont, put on no dress, decked herself with no gems for her evening* guests, but in russet went to bed ; and we saw before us indistinctly, the cattle re turning to the village, as if shadows cast on the face"], [395, "381 THE HOUSE AND HOUSEHOLD. of the rocks. Suddenly on turning a sharp angle, Ave distinguished the lines of houses against the sky, croAvning a theatre of terraces of the mulberry. This village of Antoura was dignified by a building resembling the acropolis of an Hellenic fortress, it was the church ; but the promise Avas not kept. I found the men and baggage-horses Avandering about, finding no place where to lay their heads. After continuing* the search half an hour, and being Avarned everyAvhere that the people were \" hots meaning had got the fever, a Avell dressed and portly person got up on a Avail, and saying, \" Fadda,\" \u2014 I accepted the invitation, and ascended by a ladder to a room just finished on the top of the house : it Avas absolutely bare Avails. Fire Avas ordered ; I expected to see a mangal brought in. They had no idea of the sort. I AAas asked Avhere the fire Avas to be, and on indicating the spot, a basket of earth was tumbled down ; live embers Avere then brought, over that a basket of black charcoal ; then some blocks of mulberry, the nicest of all Avoods to burn, especially in a close apartment, as it makes no smoke. I recollected the fire in the tent of cork in Morocco ; but that was a flame only, issu ing from a black, ungiowing mass; here Avas a real fir?, with its white heat and glowing embers ; the flame was like that of spirits, and the little smoke there Avas resembled vapour. Scarcely were we established, Avhen the rain and Avind assailed our exposed apartment in such a manner as to be very"], [396, "382 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. uncomfortable, and somewhat dangerous. With baskets of clay and coav dung, I managed to close up the door and other openings, leaving only a AvindoAV to leeward, and a ladder for access. I have spoken of the mangal. It is not only a most important, but also a remarkably handsome piece of Oriental furniture. It is a brazier for char- coal, which can be used with advantage for heating rooms only as follows. There must be a mass of ashes, and that mass must have an extent of surface ; for othenvise, the burning embers cannot be kept long*, and do not alloAv of the heat being suddenly raised at pleasure. The charcoal is first lighted in an open iron case, placed in the wind, or rapidly fanned till every part is thoroughly red, and the disappearance of the blue flame has shewn that the carbonic acid gas has made its escape. The hot coals are then carried to the mangal, and buried in the bed of ashes, Avhere they may lie snug and hot for four and twenty hours, or suddenly pour out their heat upon the room if you choose to rake them up Avith the pincers. The mangal, in an establishment of dis- tinction, is a vessel of brass, highly ornamented. There are some splendid specimens amongst the Cufic remains. It is of an ornamented figure, O 7 round, oval, square, or approaching* to these forms ; about 3 feet in diameter, standing about a foot from the ground, with short legs, and on the top a broad border all round : it is placed in the centre of the room. If I were to go on, dealing with the matters"], [397, "THE HOUSE AND HOUSEHOLD. 383 here involved ; such as the use and saving of fuel, its economic application for warming houses, the preparation of the body in reference to alternations of heat and cold, the part therein played by the condition of the skin, and the character of the clothing* the use of the different degrees of inten sity of fuel in reference to cooking, and finally, the impossibility of the co-existence of open fire-places and healthy lungs, and of open coal fires and the science of cookerv, I should indeed be engaged in J j \u00a9 \u00a9 writing a book, but it Avould not be on the Lebanon. In Antoura, each person seemed accustomed to the pantomime of the thumb and forefinger. I will do them the justice, however, to say, that Avhenever I pronounced in reply the word \" NazarSne,\" they slunk off, as if preserving some sense of shame. The Druzes do not beg. Among* the race of mendicants there was an exception : a boy, all in rags, who brought the clay, did not beg, and refused the bakshish I offered. I asked if he was cold ; what his father was ; what work he did : to which he an swered haughtily and successively, \"\u25a0 No \u2014 why?\" \" My father and mother are dead \u2014 why V \" I carry earth \u2014 why ?\" and then ran away. Here Avas a spirit that, not brooking pity fled even from pay, not charity. After a good supper, I lay down quite exhausted, expecting a refreshing night ; but over fatigue dis pelled sleep, and a nuit blanche made a blank day of December 16th."], [398, "384 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. I was haunted all night by the face of that boy, and the gesture Avith Avhich he met my open hand with a piece of money. What was here, never to be knoAvn ? Was it a Hampden, a Milton, or a Cromwell, or something* for Avhich the name yet re mains to be found ? There must be some equality in the distribution of faculties and characters to the races of the earth. Had I found collected in this urchin, the share of spirit and independence ori ginally allotted for the millions of Syria? During that day, being unable to move, my pen was busy. The storm had ceased, but it came back again at night. The weather cleared up on the morning of the 17th, and I reluctantly set forth; we were soon drenched to the skin, and took refuge in a village not three miles distant. Dec. 19th. \u2014 I have had'during these two days an experience such as it falls to the lot of no foreigners travelling in England to obtain ; that of dwelling\" \u00a9 \u00a9 / O under the roof of the poorest of its inhabitants. Iso- lated and shut in by the weather, I have lived after their fashion, slept as they sleep, eaten of their fare, heard their story, seen their habits ; and acquired a clear and definite idea of their existence, such as I had not obtained during* two months spent among* them, but not in exclusive contact with the poor. These villages are restricted in their produce to silk and grapes, there are no fields cultivable in the neighbourhood. They are at a distance from the cities of the coast, and from the plains, so that they"], [399, "THE HOUSE AND HOUSEHOLD. 385 have to pay an additional price, alike for the produce of the country, and for that imported, on account of the English tariff. Thus rice is 25 per cent dearer than at Beyrout ; corn 50 per cent dearer than in the Bkkaa. The property chiefly belongs to Emirs, and they are mere farmers. It Avill be evident that I am not selecting favourable specimens in the families I am g'oing to describe. Nothing can be simpler than their state. They pay to Government a fixed sum ; a fixed sum to the church. They have certain fixed seasons of Avork and of idleness. They have abundance of substantial food and coarse clothing, but nothing beyond. They have no aspirations or cares. They haA'e little to fear from bad, or to expect from peculiarly favour able seasons. They are good-natured without being hospitable ; they are laborious Avithout in genuity; fair dealing* without integrity. YouavouM neither call them light-hearted and gay, nor morose and stupid. Their ideas wander scarcely beyond the limits of their sight ; if they are in this respect as low a3 the European boor, they are, in manners, above the European gentleman. When I asked them what they did Avhen a quarrel arose ; theyansAvered, \" The devil made it \u2014 God will settle it.\" When I asked them why they had made the last Avar; they answered, \" Others went and some of us too.\" When I asked if they hated the Druzes; they answered, \" We neither bless them, nor curse them.\" When I asked if they were content with 2 c"], [400, "386 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. being* deprived of their arms ; they said, \" Others are deprived of theirs.\" As to their general circum stances all they had to say Avas, that they were better off noAv, than under Emir Beshir, paid the same in money, but less otherwise. The house in which I am writing, which is the best in the village, though there is little difference \u00a9 7 \u00a9 between them, is 25 feet broad, 50 feet long*, and 8 high. It is divided into two parts by a mud parti- tion ; on one side lives the mother and her younger son, on the other the elder \"and his newly married wife. It cost 1500 piastres building, and is of rude masonry (this being off the limestone and on the sandstone) of dry stone, plastered within with clay. The roof, the weighty part, is supported by three transverses of trees, a yard in girth, resting in the centre on a column of four stones, one above another. The timber of the roof cost 600 piastres, the wall about 8c? the square yard. The interior is destitute of all kinds of fittings or furniture ; there are no windows or chimneys ; a shoulder against the door is composed of reeds and clay, and serves for a cupboard ; the mocade, or Ioav clay fire-place, at the angle of this shoulder, affording a snug corner Avithin for foul Aveather: in it I am now sitting*. O 7 writing by the light of a pine-wood fire at 2 o'clock in the day.

The nargille completes the establishment. Coarse mats and sheep-skins are laid on the part occupied by the family ; they have a quilting* to lie on, and one for covering, with a couple of cushions to offer to a guest ; but their own night-clothes seem to be chiefly their capotes. The dress of the men is the red cap, or tarbuch, round Avhich is Avound the kefieh, or the calemkiar ; the first is that which the Arabs hang* over the head and shoulders, binding it on by a rope, or grummet, of camel's hair ; the latter is muslin, which used to be dyed or painted in the houses, in flowers and figures, and AA'hich is named after the pen 2 c2"], [402, "388 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. (Calem). These are now imitated in Europe, and it is the only imitation Avhich has not been prejudicial to the costume of the country. This head-dress, Avhich is neither the naked red cap nor the ponder ous turban, is the handsomest I know. The chief article of dress is the abba, which by the working population is curtailed in all directions, and instead of the slits for the hands at the corners of the large square sack, is fitted with short arms ; it is of coarse woollen stuff, hard laid : the Avoof much thicker than the warp, and having* the look of pop lin; it is striped white or black, but is sometimes mixed Avith red and blue and gold and silver thread ; it is of beautiful Avorkmanship and of infinite variety. The jacket has open sleeves, is of camel's hair, broAvn in colour, and embroidered in blue lace. The inner jacket and long troAvsers are of the American coarse unbleached cloth, called Domestic, which they dye blue ; the troAvsers are of course ample. The The belt is the Scotch imitation shawl of Ioav quality, and the costume is completed by a pair of red shoes of ancient form ; the calceus of the Romans, and such as we find in the Lycian tombs, and called mdass. The cap (they have not yet taken to those made at Constantinople and in France, of glaring* colour, which may be had down to 3 piastres) costs 25 piastres, and lasts tAvo years. The mandil costs 6 piastres, lasts six months; the kefieh costs 8 piastres, and lasts two years ; the abbas costs"], [403, "389 THE HOUSE AND HOUSEHOLD. 15 piastres, and lasts a year ; the domir, or jacket of camel's hair, costs 45 piastres, and lasts two years ; the meintan and shalvar (jacket and trowsers) costs 35 piastres, and lasts six months ; the belt 22 piastres, and lasts two years ; the shoes costs 10 piastres, three pairs for the year ; also three shirts of Frangi stout cotton at 7 piastres. The dress of my host thus stands him in 200 piastres a year, of which 30 are for shoes.

The belt is the same as that of the men, and the expense of their dress is equal to that of the men. They eat twice a day in winter, and three times in summer ; one meal is always hot : the chief dish is bourgoul, stewed in fat or oil with onions, and eaten with scons. To this is added lentils, cheese, preserve of grapes, and lebben, fresh or dried. This family consumes 600 okes of wheat for cakes, and 130 okes of bourgoul at b\\ piastres the oke, about 350 piastres a year; 10 rotols of oil at 8 piastres, 80 piastres.

To this is to be added taxes, Avhich amount to, charatch for two, 40 piastres; other taxes, 75; in all 1575 piastres, or about \u00a315. Their resources are, tAvo hundred mulberry trees, which produce silk Avorth 500 piastres ; and a vine yard of two hundred vine-stocks, which gives as much more. They make up the rest by labour in the fields, at three piastres a day ; tAvo hands for four months gives 800 piastres. They also plant a little grain or vegetables between the mulberries and the vines, and from these last they get their wine and preserves. They have over 20 pounds of rough silk (bourre de soie) Avhich is spun for clothing, or sold when bo spun at 20 piastres the oke. By these means, and probably by a considerable squeezing out in the Avear of hosiery, they make both ends meet. Tavo months is all they expend on their oavh trees and"], [405, "391 THE HOUSE AND HOUSEHOLD. vines ; and thus the two men by their OAvn confession are absolutely idle six months in the year, and the women are nearly so ; for they have here no corn to grind, no Avebs to Aveave, no beds to make, nothing* but the cakes and bourgoul, Avhich are soon disposed of; the little silk spinning they do is the merest amusement. With the spare time of men and women, every thing* they Avear might be home made, and one half or more of their yearly outlay saved. They might also have every comfort in their home if they only used the knife as Ulysses was wont to do. They have the materials of life in abundance on the six months labour of the male adults alone ; they suffer only from the inconvenience attached to the absence of cleanly habits, Avhich, if they had them, Avould induce them to bestow a fraction of their unoccu pied time in internal arrangements and external con veniences, Avhich would make their dwellings equal in comfort to Avhat their life is in ease. When I asked them how they could sit and do nothing*, the ansAver Avas, \" We have to attend to the fire ;\" and no Avonder, because they have neither windoAv nor fireplace ; they said they had never learnt to cut wood or to weave avooI. I pointed out to them the Arab tent, where nothing Avas spent for what was used or Avorn ; no sense either of cupidity or of shame was aAvakened by the suggestion, or the re proach; at least there was no ansAver. The tAvo products of the country are, silk and"], [406, "392 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. grapes. The mulberry trees are kept small, the branches being cut off at about five feet, so as to keep them Avithin reach ; they stand generally about eight feet apart, and when terraced are planted in the Avail, leaving the earth free for any other culture. A pair of oxen in half a day turns up the small patch they occupy. They are Avorth ten piastres, or two shillings a piece to purchase. The seed of the worm for one hundred trees is one and a half thimble fuls, histban. The cocoons Aveigh nine okes ; which consist of one oke Avorms, seven refuse silk, and one spun silk ; the latter sells for 110 piastres, the former is carded and spun as wool ; unspun it is Avorth six piastres the oke, spun 20; a woman will spin an oke in their manner in tAventy days. They might thus make from the hundred trees 240 piastres ; but the spun silk is generally retained for domestic purposes, and from it is made the admirable stuff used for sheeting* and shirting before the cheap English and American cottons came in. The vines are planted exactly as the mulberries, and cultivated in the same manner, only the steins are left long and supported on stakes ; the grapes are Avhite, and with a very fine skin. The vine yard furnishes grapes for consumption during five months, besides 40 okes of wine and 30 of dibs. The wine is thick, light coloured, and sweet, resem bling must. The grapes are exposed twenty days in the sun, then pressed, and the juice boiled rapidly for an hour ; this is the whole process. It is then"], [407, "393 THE HOUSE AND HOUSEHOLD. put in the large jars, Avhich are hard and strong ; the orifice is closed Avith coav's dung, Avhich is the luting used on all occasions : it Avill keep for three years. Three okes of grapes make one of wine* It is Avorth from twenty to thirty paras the oke. The dibs, the honey of Scripture, Avhich Jacob sent to Joseph, is the inspissated juice of the grape. It is of two sorts, one dark and liquid, resembling molasses, this is the Hacou ; the other is thick, of a yelloAV broAvn, and is called dibs (Jibes). In every village there is an establishment for making it : a \u00a9 7 some of these bear marks of great antiquity ; there are vats for pressing, and troughs cut in the rock for holding the juice, and a furnace for boiling it. The grapes are not trodden by the foot, but laid in a heap and pressed by a beam, of which one end is fixed in the wall and a heavy stone attached to the other ; as the oil seems anciently to have been ex pressed, judging by the relics I observed near Tyre. The juice is then boiled in the iron pan for an hour, then poured back into the trough ; after it has cooled, it is again returned into the pan and boiled, if for the racou for three hours, if for jibes four. The process is thus complete for the first; the second is still liquid, and is conveyed home, where durin\u00b0* a month it is daily for an hour turned or beaten with a fresh branch of fig-tree or botun. This property of the juice of the fig-tree is curious; anciently it Avas used instead of rennet, as Athen\u00e6us informs us, for making the cheese called Tromclias ;"], [408, "394 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. it occurred to me that this must be of the nature of yaourt (lebben). I made the experiment, and by turning boiled milk Avith a fig branch at once ob tainad yaourt. I aftenvards found that in the island of Scio, when they are in want of the leaven of yaourt, they make use of the same process.* The racou takes four okes of grapes to make one oke ; the jibes five : the first is worth 40 paras, and the second 60. The bourgoul I have often mentioned, without describing the manner of making it, Avhich is as folloAvs : The Avheat is boiled for an hour ; little water is used ; when it is absorbed, more is added ; it is then put in the sun to dry, and sent to the mill and crushed ; it is sifted to obtain equal fineness ; the coarser part is used for the poultry ; it is made once a year. This dish stands betAveen couscous sou and pilaff; the first is cooked by mere steam ing ; the latter by a mixed process of boiling in water and butter ; as soon as cooked in the former, the later is poured over it to make it swelLf When I first tasted bourgoul I thought it Avas cooked in the same manner, but I now find that the process is reversed ; the butter or oil (for the latter is used on fast days, of Avhich they have 124 in the year) is first boiled ; then the bourgoul is thrown into it * For yaourt, that most valuable preparation of milk, I must refer the reader to the \" Pillars of Hercules,\" vol. ii. t The heat of the one is applied at 212, the other at 600 de grees."], [409, "395 THE HOUSE AND HOUSEHOLD. and turned in it with a spoon for about a minute, then water is added in sufficient quantity, as in the case of rice, exactly to cook the dish. It is not eaten with a spoon, but with little twisted cornets of the marcook, which you tear like bi'OAvn paper; it thus resembles the couscoussou, in so far at least as not being eaten Avith a spoon. To the latter dish I have elsewhere attributed a high antiquity, and derived it from the Holy Land : I have from it inferred that wheat, not known as an indigenous plant, came originally from that country ; and also that in borroAving the grain we had failed to copy the methods for cooking it devised by its original possessors. The bourgoul confirms these positions ; it ascends to a period prior to the invention of spoons, and the gTain is called Taim* Avhich, throughout the East, stands for rations. The whole grain, without change in its nature, as by fermen tation or division of its parts, as by our separation of it into different qualities, is used for food. It has the advantage of being a hot cooked dish, without consuming* fire or time ; the dish makes the meal, and is ready in ten minutes. It is then eaten with the marcook, also prepared without loss or fermen tation ; and thus this family sits down daily to a hot meal of Avheat, so palatable and satisfying* that they neither desire addition nor chang*e. The condi ments are tAvo ounces of tallow. They generally, indeed, add the preserve of grapes, and lebben, fresh * Thence the word Timariot, feudal-chief."], [410, "396 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. or dried, Avhen it resembles cream cheese a little acidulated. The expense of this family for living I have set down at \u00a36, for four adult persons. Wheat is here 5J piastres the measure, while it is only 2\\ in the Bkkaa. Oil is 5 piastres instead of 4 the oke ; so that the charge is greatly above the aver age. Yet this comes but to 30s per head, or 360 pence, so that their diet is obtained for less than one penny a day. It may appear extraordinary that this dish should have escaped the observation of travellers, yet it is easily accounted for. I might have reached thus far without once seeing it, unless I had knoAvn it beforehand ; and I knew of it merely from the habit of examining the contents of shops. Having seen it in a shop at Beyrout, I ordered it at my hotel. They smiled and looked shy ; and positively the order had to be thrice re peated and enforced, before I got it. Everywhere it Avas the same struggle. That curse of our ag'e, the aping of things from other lands, has made them ashamed of their OAvn dish ; besides it costs one-third less than rice. This of course would not have sufficed to keep travellers in ignorance of its existence, but gentlemen travellers, however fond they may be of the kitchen, do not add cookery to their acquirements ; and travelling ladies are more given to political than domestic economy. I had here a practical illustration of the difference of our bread and theirs. I had injured my foot in the passage of the mountain, and found it ne-"], [411, "THE HOUSE AND HOUSEHOLD. 397 cessary to put on a poultice. There being no bread, I folded some of the marcook, strained it, and ap plied it; when it lay close and clean as if the folds of a cloth. 1 prepared to change it at the usual time; but instead of the sour disagreeable smell of our bread poultice, it Avas as fresh as Avhen laid on ; I consequently left it, and after the time had elapsed for three changes, and it Avas no longer wanted, it Avas still fresh. What must the difference be in the application to the stomach ? I have said that the bourgoul Avas prepared Avith talloAV ; that is rendered mutton fat. When I learned this, I was greatly astonished ; for I had been commending* the butter Avhich I thought had been used, as particularly free from the generally offensive flavour of that substance in this country. Yet it Avas talloAV all the while, and this let me into an interesting feature of their domestic economy. In the month of June, they buy from the shep herds, when pasturage has become scarce and sheep are cheap, tAvo or three sheep : these they feed by hand. After they have eaten up the odd grass and other provender about the doors, they get vine leaves, and, after the silk worms have begun to spin, mul berry leaves. They purchase them on trial, and the test is appetite ; if a sheep does not feed well, they return it after three days ; to increase their appetite they Avash them thoroughly twice a day, morning and evening \u2014 a care thev never bestoAv on their OAvn bodies. If the sheep's appetite does not come"], [412, "398 DIARY IN THE LEBANON. up to their standard, they use a little gentle violence, folding for them forced-leaf-balls, and introducing them into their mouths. The mulberry has the pro perty of making them fat and tender ; at the end of four months the sheep they had bought at 80 piastres, will sell for 140, or will realize, as about to be described, 150. The sheep is killed, skinned, and hung up. The fat is then removed ; the flesh is cut in stripes from the bones and hung up in the sun. Meanwhile, the fat has been put in a cauldron on the fire, and as soon as it has come to boil, the meat is laid in ; the proportion of the fat to the meat is as four to ten, eight okes fat and twenty lean : a little salt is added, it is simmered for an hour, and then placed in jars for the use of the family during the year. The larger joints are separated and used first, as not fit for keeping long. The fat Avith a portion of the lean, chopped fine, is what serves for the cook ing the bourgoul. It is called Dehen. The sheep are of the fat-tailed variety ; and the tails are the great delicacy. The only thing that remains to speak of, is their religious instruction, if indeed there is any thin o to say on this score. They have churches ; and as they pass them, they go and kiss one of the stones. The ceremonies are gone through by form, and Avithout charge on their consciences or pockets. The only observance I could make out, was of the fast days. Each male from fourteen years, pays to the"], [413, "THE HOUSE AND HOUSEHOLD. 399 priest 10 piastres, and a measure of corn ; to the bishop 2 piastres. I have as yet found no schools. On these two points they differ from the Mussulmans, Avho do not pay for their church and who have schools. The Mussulman besides holds as duties, cleanliness and hospitality; though the idea of clean liness is, alas, reduced to the existing standard. Often did I wish that Mahomet could come and con vert these people (I mean the Mussulmans), for this country might be a Paradise, if they were Mussul mans. Habits of cleanliness Avould bring- habits of industry. These are minute details, and may appear fatigue ing. Yet, of common consent, descriptions of the condition of different nations are desirable. What use in a description, unless it be complete ? This country contains the records of the most ancient things. It is so in art, science, institutions, monu ments, and races. Why should we not have here also records in regard to those all essential domestic matters, Avhich are the real elements of every state ; Avhat is done and left undone, every day, in each cottage ; that is, hoAV a people feeds and clothes itself? Doubtless the feeding and the clothing of the people is but idle speculation, if Ave deal with it simply as a matter of curiosity. But why should we not, on the contrary, deal Avith it, as a matter of profit and instruction ? It is in the nature of man so to do, Avhen man remains as God made him.

The desire to obtain en joyment ; the desire to benefit myself from them ; the desire to benefit them from anything* I knoAv.
