CHAPTER I. On a bright July day, in the garden of a dear old English home, might be seen about noon a man reclin ing on a couch. There was on his countenanc3 a worn, tired expression, as if he felt his confinement and longed to be up and about, looking after tilings as of old. Of late he had been obliged to give up all active habits and consent to be wheeled from place to place in a chair. At the particular moment he is intro duced to the reader, his face was somewhat flushed with pleasurable excitement, for his eyes were cast upon the figure of a dark-haired, handsome little boy, just then exclaiming with wild delight, \" I did it, papa! I did it all b}r myself!\" He flourished in the air as he spoke a large old-fashioned horse-pistol, that had been handed down for some two or three genera tions. With this pistol his father had been teaching him to shoot, or rather, having taken it into the garden to scare away the birds from the fruit, he had persuaded him to fire it off\"."], [8, "v> VAGABOND CHARLIE. The boy was only between three and four years old, and the pistol more than he could hold out straight, yet, with the aid of his father's arm as a support, he did succeed in firing off one or two shots. His mother, hearing the reports, and a little alarmed, ran out of the library window to make quite sure her boy was uninjured. She came forward with a look of mingled pride at the boy's boldness, and reproach at the father's rashness in trusting one so young with a pistol. Whilst she was playfully remonstrating with her husband, and patting the curly head of her boy, there were heard shouts of \" Let me have a try !\" \" Let me have a try !\" and two bigger boys came bounding through an adjoining shrubbery. They had little blue bags in their hands, and were returning from a day school, and it was the daily custom of their papa and mamma and little brother Charlie to be on the look out for them. Directly they reached the group, the pistol was taken possession of and re-loaded by the eldest boy, who was a fine, noble-looking little fellow of tlie true Saxon type, with light hair and blue eyes. He advanced cautiously towards an unwary small bird, and knocked him over to the intense delight of Charlie ; the little fellow did not know that his own shots were loaded blank, so he thought his brother a tremendous man ! It is of Charlie, especially, the reader will hear most about in these pages ; his brothers will therefore occupy only a small space in the narrative. Well ! Charlie was by no means an ordinary child ; there was nothing startling about his appearance, nor at this early age had he developed any peculiarity of"], [9, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 3 disposition, but he was a boy of extraordinary fancies and unusual desires. His home may possibly have had something to do with these early tendencies. The place where he first saw daylight was in one of those dear old English homes which are half country and half farm houses. All the back premises and offices were laid out and built for the farm, but the front was of a more private and ornamental character. Chief amongst the attractions was a wide, deep verandah, where, on damp mornings, when he could not run about, Master Charlie was confined whilst waiting for his brothers' return from school. He used often then to feed on the ivy berries and fancy he was eating the bread-fruit from trees in a foreign country, of which he had heard his brothers talk about, in the wisdom of their school-acquired lore. On both sides the house there was a small fir planta tion, through which ran the main drive up to the house. In these plantations little Charlie was early allowed to wander alone, and feed his fancy in their quiet re treats. A fir plantation, of all others, more readily and in tensely imparts the charm of solitude. It is astonish ing how very small a circumference of these close growing: and ever-verdant trees will create in their midst a silence and grandeur peculiar to themselves. All outward sounds seem lost, except that the ear is enchanted with the soft sighs of the whispering breeze, ever struggling to penetrate the thickly interlaced branches, and the eve is smitten by the semi-twilight gloom caused by their tangled densit}\\ 1\u20142"], [10, "4 VAGABOND CHARLIE. Leading out of one of these plantations was a shady lane, which came out at the back of the farm stables into the rick-yard. This lane was another favourite resort of Charlie's. Curiously enough, at this age he had most funny notions about going round the world and being a great traveller. There was a small summer house, built in a quaint old style, that Charlie used to fancy ought to have been the castle King Richard was confined in ; and he was never so happy as when he could persuade his eldest brother to shut himself up in this, whilst he walked round singing some childish ditty, in the hope that his noble knight would recog nise the voice of his faithful squire. Down the shady lane he used to fancy was the way to France, and one day he caught sight of some strange men felling trees close by. Some of them wore red worsted caps, which so frightened Charlie that he ran home, insisting that Bonaparte had arrived, and the French were really coming to storm the house, and it was a long time ere he could persuade himself to go that way again alone. Another peculiar fancy was that, at the end of the stairs, in that circular part at the bottom of the banisters, there was always a bogey named Boxer ; consequently, he never went up or down stairs by him self without rushing past this place in a great fright; and if any one was with him he always chose the wall side. He had a funny way (but I believe a common one amongst children) of showing his affection for any thing alive by squeezing it, if in his power, to death. He was a great friend amongst the fowls, and was always wanting to get into their house and sleep with"], [11, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 5 them. One da}' he succeeded in getting into the house with some young ducks just hatched; here he was found hugging and kissing them to such an extent, that more than one fell a victim to his exuberant affec tion. The nurse said it was a mercy the old bird did not peck his eyes out. She, poor creature, was accus tomed to little Charlie, and never thought the hand that had fed and patted her so often could now be so cruel and unfeeling. He, poor boy, when told what he had done was heart-broken, and sobbed for hours, remembering, for years afterwards, the untimely end of these little ducklings. Another idea was, that a certain lane across the paddock was always inhabited by gipsies. He had once seen an encampment there, and henceforth pic tured to himself this place as a rendezvous for fortune tellers, child-stealers, and general vagabondism ; and would not pass that way for the brightest penny ever coined, without his brothers, or some other companion. Just as Charlie had completed his fourth year, his father, on account of continued ill health, was advised to leave this country home, and take a house in the neighbouring town. During two years which were spent in this new home, Master Charlie's peculiarities became more fully developed, I am sorry to relate chiefly on the side of mischief. He still kept up his ideas about travelling round the world. There was one street in particular in which he used to picture himself starting on a journey. He was in imagination duly caparisoned as a knight in armed mail ; he rode a war-horse, and was surrounded by wondering little boys, and admiring inhabitants, who in due time would"], [12, "6 VAGABOND CHARLIE. celebrate his triumphant return through a large gate way at the extreme end of this street. This said gate really opened into a coal wharf by a canal ! Charlie had three great pets, the only live stock brought from the country : viz., an old Newfoundland dog called Nep, a bantam cock, and a sandy-coloured cat. These had been such old pets of his father's, and had become so part and parcel of the establishment, that it was resolved they should live and die together, and this they literally did. All three took up their abode in the Newfoundland's kennel; they fed out of the same pan, basked together in the daytime, and, at night, Nep's broad back and woolly coat formed a famous sleeping-place for the cat and bantam. It was no unusual thing for Master Charlie to be found cuddling up with this group in the day, or making a fourth in their gambols. Here I may remark on the apparent ease with which happy families may be formed by associating the animals together on friendly terms. In the old country home there had been no special partiality shown by these three for one another. The dog and cat were simply on good terms with themselves and all the feathered tribe on the farm. But when they found themselves confined to the limits of a small back yard in place of the boundless freedom they had hitherto enjoyed, it seemed as if they were drawn together by a chord of mutual sympathy and commiseration. It can hardly be doubted they sadly bewailed their change of situation. They pined away rapidly, and it was not many months before the bantam was found dead by the dog's side, with the cat mewling very"], [13, "7 VAGABOND CHARLIE. piteously, and the dog sorrowfully howling its requiem. This they prolonged till the cat lay down cold and stiff within a few yards of the spot. After the death of his companions Nep persistently refused to leave the pre mises or eat any food. Charlie used all his persuasion to rouse him out of his affliction, and once actually got him out of the yard and a short distance from home by dint of pushing and shoving. All the time the dog kept turning back and looking very miserable ; he had real tears in his eyes, and it was hopeless to try and get him far away. All efforts made to dissipate his grief proved unavailing, and poor Nep very shortly ended his term of days. Charlie's mind seemed now to settle more than ever into mischief. At one end of a small garden his father had fitted up a green-house in which it was his great pleasure, when well enough, to spend an hour or so tending some choice plants. Amongst others, an orange tree had this year put forth fruit, and consequently claimed for itself particular attention. On this tree a very tempting-looking orange peeped out through the leaves, close to the inside wall, and the sight of it often made Charlie's mouth water. One day he heard his papa say : \" By next Sunday that will be ripe, and we will pluck it.\" The boy knew that often his father oould not get down on a week day, but that he always made a great effort to get to church on Sunday, and after church he walked, or was carried, round the garden. It occurred to the intelligent little rascal, \" If I am to get that orange at all it must be now or never.\" Without more ado he went to the green-house, and, instead of"], [14, "8 VAGAEOND CHARLIE. stealing the orange right out, squeezed himself up behind the tree, eat out half the inside as it hung suspended, and lest the outside apparently untouched. Then, satisfy ing himself by a careful examination that it would re quire a sharp eye to discover the fraud, he went out thinking it was all right. He never calculated on the shrivelled- up appearance the empty part of the orange would present to his father's eyes in a few days; but, notwithstanding, a sense of guilty shame kept him in perpetual fear for the rest of the week, nor would he again venture near the green-house. Of course on the Sunday his father discovered the depredation. Charlie was sent for, and was fortunately saved the trouble of telling a lie by means of a peculiar tooth-mark on the rind, which left no doubt as to who was the culprit. This was Charlie's first temptation to tell a lie, but the evidence against him was too conclusive, so he made a virtue of necessity, and acknowledged the theft \u2014 a confession that considerably lightened his punishment. Not long afterwards there came a sad experience for the boy ; he did not really mean to tell a lie this time, but was credited with one, and severely punished. It came about this way : his mother had driven into the country to spend a few days with a relative, and it was arranged that the nurse and children should walk in the afternoon to meet the pony-carriage and drive home. When the carriage came in sight, Charlie seized a piece of dead stick and ran in front of the pony. The driver, not knowing he was to meet the children, did not pull up as he might have done. The pony was fresh, and"], [15, "9 VAGABOND CHARLIE. unused to being stopped by the orders of a small urchin enforcing his commands with a stick, so he gave a tre mendous shy and bolted, leaving the disconsolate boy lost in dismay at the consequence of his rash act. The pony and trap went off at the rate of a good sixteen miles an hour, followed by the nurse and three children screaming like mad. The road was luckily straight, and approaching objects were seen at some distance off All went fairly enough for a few hundred yards ; the boy driving seemed to collect himself, and obtain mastery of the frightened pony, but not suffi ciently so to stop before they came to a very steep hill. The brow of this hill being reached, there was no hope of saving a smash. The pony seemed to gather fresh strength from his partial restraint ; the boy got frightened, let go the reins, and clung like grim death to the railings of the trap ; consequently, away they went down this hill at a fearful pace, and half way down they cannoned against a big waggon slowly coining up. This sent boy and trap up in she air, and brought them down with a fearful crash \u2014 \"the boy below and the trap above.\" The pony and shafts, freed from further en cumbrance, continued their wild career till stopped by tlie traffic of the town, through which the pony endea voured to reach his stables. The boy was released from his prison-house, and, wonderful to say, was not very much damaged, with the exception of a few out side scratches and an awful fright. The trap was all anyhow, and looked like a broken umbrella. Instead of the nurse and children reaching home a happy, united party, each came his own way ; Charlie,"], [16, "10 VAGABOND CHARLIE. as a matter of course, the last. Nurse judiciously took advantage of this and \" told master all about it,\" care fully omitting to mention the abuse and cuffs she had showered on the poor boy's head, to say nothing ot all the bad names she had called him. Charlie, on his arrival, already crushed and heart broken, was sent for by his father, and as his explana tion varied considerably from the nurse's, without much ceremony he was accused of telling a lie. He got a severe thrashing, and was sent straight off to bed. This was papa's and nurse's joint idea of how to get at the truth. The little fellow had been thoroughly mis understood, and could only sob and think if his mother were at home things might be different. Had ho really been guilty of telling a lie his reflections would perhaps have been more penitent ; as it was, he felt bitterly enraged with nurse and every one else con nected with the transaction. He knew himself to be the original offender, but not as a liar or intentional wrong-doer. Here is an instance of how easily children may be misunderstood. We give them silly names, and always think they mean so do wrong, and often undeservedly credit them with bad intentions, judging by the result of their conduct rather than the motive. In this case Charlie had no idea whatever of making the pony run away. All he wanted was a ride, and so he set to work to stop the trap the best wa)' he knew. There was no lie to tell about it; the accident happened from sheer ignorance and childish simplicity. It is sometimes affirmed that innocence enables one to bear up against any unjust accusation and punish-"], [17, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 11 ment. It seems to me there is far more comfort in leeling that you have done wrong and are justly punished (if only you rightly sorrow for the evil and ,not only for the punishmeut inflicted), than there is in knowing you have done right and have not been under- stood. CHAPTER II. Another change of residence was determined upon by the father, when Charlie was about six years old. Of His numerous peccadillos, up to the time of his going to school, it would be tedious to relate anything. He had an intense desire to get away to school, not that he was unhappy at home, but an innate love of change and adventure seemed ingrained in the boy. The morning the coach called at the door he was last seen grinning at the housemaid as she called out \" Good-bye, Master Charlie.\" Deluded mortal ! he soon found out the difference between home and school. Pay attention, fathers and mothers of the present day, who protest against corporal punishment and Other inflictions called savage and barbarous ! Hear a little that took place not so very many years ago at a small private school (numbering some twenty- eight boys), in the vicinity of one of our largest universities. Arrived at the school, after a choking good-bye to his mother, Charlie ran into the play-ground with the other boys, from whom he learnt enough of the pros pect before him to frighten him; and yet their de scription fell far short of the reality."], [18, "12 VAGABOND CHARLIE. In the evening all the boys were called up singly to the head master's desk, asked how much money they had brought with them, what kind of knife they pos sessed, and several like questions. The older boys quite understood this, and gave answers accord ingly. Charlie, in the verdure of innocence, produced what was to him the magnificent fortune of three shillings and sixpence in silver, and threepence copper. Im agine the boy's intense disgust when told he would be allowed no pocket-money over and above the coppers, which he might keep to look at. The master Avould take charge of the silver to buy necessaries and pay fines. At the end of the half, if there was any balance due to him he would surely get it. The boy's ideas of arithmetic were somewhat vague, still he had sufficient knowledge of how man)' pennies made three shillings and sixpence to feel pretty sure he would never \"come to his own again.\" Of fines and necessaries he knew nothing ; his little heart came into his throat, and tears rose ready to bursting ; but he battled bravely with them, and was on the point of crushing his feelings when the knife question arose. He produced a beautiful two-bladed knife, with cork screw, gimblet, picker, etc., etc., given him by his father as a prize for good conduct : it was a knife of knives to Charlie. The master coolly laid hold of this, and asked Charlie his age ; when told he was only seven, he said : \" Ah, we don't allow little boys of your age to have anything but single-bladed knives. This one will go in my desk, and at the end of the half, if not forfeited,"], [19, "13 VAGABOND CHARLIE. will be given you with the balance of your pocket money.\" This speech broke down all restraint, and the boy's pent-up grief broke forth in howls. Just fancy ! In one fell swoop this human vulture had pounced upon and seized all he valued. As a matter of fact the knife was forfeited, and the money all spent by the end of the half. The necessaries turned out to be an arrangement of the following kind : Every Saturday night each boy wrote out what he wanted in the shape of pens, ink, paper, and general stationery ; on the Monday evening these articles were given out, and paid for out of the appropriated pocket-money. If not all spent thus, a few judicious fines easily swept &w&y the rest. In most cases an additional account was accumulated against the fathers, except among the wealthier ones, who brought suffi cient to meet all these liabilities, and even to leave them a few shillings to go home with. Coppers to a limited extent were allowed ; but the limit was con fined to a very narrow boundary, as Charlie found out to his cost. The second half, he and another boy planned to bring all their money in coppers ; so, when they were called up to disgorge, they truly said they had nothing but some coppers. They were allowed to go down \u2014 Charlie conscious of a bag secretly containing four shillings' worth of pence, and his friend of one contain in\"- half-a-crown's worth, and a regular white elephant these turned out to be ! They were certainly better off than some of the boys ; but what could they do with this money ? The school was a good mile away from"], [20, "14 VAGABOND CHARLIE. any shop, and then there was only a little village one, whose proprietor would have split upon any youngster who spent a farthing without leave. There was no place in the world to keep this bag of money except an open locker containing books aud. other property, and every time Charlie or his friend changed a book, or went for a pen or pencil, they were in dread of being found out. All the boys' lockers were in one large frame like pigeon-holes, so it was touch and go at any moment who or what would unearth their trea sure. They were soon found out in a way not calcu lated on. There was one day boy in the school ; he was a simple little fellow, who came each morning to breakfast and left in the afternoon. This boy Charlie and his friend trusted with sixpence, duly instructing him what to buy, carefully warning him not to get found out, and if all was done well, promising him a liberal commission in the shape of \" sucks.\" What did the little donkey do ? Why, the next morning he appeared at the breakfast table, and deposited one packet of sweeties before Charlie and another in front of his friend ! This, in the presence of the whole school, and with the master at the head of the table ! Such a breach of discipline would certainly meet with severe punishment ! The guilty boys turned all colours of the rainbow, and the rest trembled as if some fearful catastrophe was about to happen. Sure enough it did, for then and there Charlie and his chum were called up, made to confess the truth, and two senior boys having been bidden to search the lockers, produced, before the astonished eyes of all, the secreted wealth. Vainly did both boys plead that the money"], [21, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 15 was all in coppers, and that it was allowed. Not a bit of it. They both got well thrashed, forfeited their money, and had a long task to do ; besides, Charlie got a double dose of thrashing and imposition, because he punched that stupid little boy's head directly he got out of school. One barbarism of this school was that every day, during nine months of the year, all the boys were marched down two and two to a river to bathe. The spot selected was a very gloomy, dark, chill-looking place. A certain portion was fenced in by floating bars ! the jumping-in place was six or seven feet deep, shallowing up to two or three towards a sand bank, on which the small fry collected after their plunge. It was a rule which admitted of no exception, that every boy must jump in, and if he did not do so of his own accord, he was thrown in. Here Charlie used to have one little bit of satisfaction in witnessing the daily yells and struggles of the little ass of a boy who had got him into trouble. This little fellow was ex cessively timid and nervous, and of very delicate frame, but in the hands of our Spartan-like master this mattered nothing ; the rule was fixed and unalterable. No wonder that many of the little boys dreaded this daily bath ! On a very fine day it was bearable ; but as often as not it would be cold and wet; this also signified nothing : \" Strip and jump in !\" was the order for all weathers, and for all boys. As far as Charlie ever learnt, this treatment did no one any harm. I should like to know what would be said now of any school in which such training was persisted in, by"], [22, "16 VAGABOND CHARLIE. penny papers and by affectionate parents of J^oung boys ranging from six years old and upwards to sixteen. The actual thrashing at this school was unlimited. Charlie, after many efforts to overcome the feeling of being in perpetual fear which had been established by his lollipop escapade, gradually settled down into a fit of helpless despondency. He could give his mind to nothing in the way of study, and got to the bottom of the school in company with one other boy ; these two formed a class by themselves, and the others facetiously called them \" the two worthies.\" They were certainly worthy of better treatment than they received. At every lesson, task, or exercise, invariably the same thing happened. On the slightest mistake it was, \"Hand out,\" or \"Hand down, sir ;\" the boy would hold out his shivering hand well-licked and spat upon, then down came a thwack that would make him jump; this was simply \"hand out.\" A degree of refinement was added to the \" hand down.\" For this purpose was kept a dark red-coloured cushion, on which the luck- less victim had to place- his hand to prevent all chance of its giving with the blow, and to secure its receiving the full force fairly, and no mistake. An exaggerated -case led to being hauled over a stool and well whacked behind, so as to render sitting down for the next day \u2022or two not a \"faithful remembrance of one so dear,\" but a cruel and torturing reminder of one detested. This, the extreme penalty of the law, was but seldom resorted to, but the hand work was of hourly oc currence. Charlie's greatest pleasure at this school was count ing the collects on Sunday in church, to see how near"], [23, "17 VAGABOND CHARLIE. the end of the half was ; and his spirits revived bit by bit as each week went by. Then came the holiday letter officially informing his parents that on such and such a day, they might reasonably hope to see their youthful progeny home again. After this the boy didn't care a blow for any one, and began really to live once more. He became so exhilarated that, at the break-up supper, when the toasts went round and it came to his turn, he proposed \" the Archbishop of Canterbury ;\" the toast was re ceived with loud cheers, and Charlie gained tremen dous kudos even fromt he master who had beaten him so unmercifully. In most lives I suppose there is one particular spot on which we look back as the one true experience of unalloyed happiness. With Charlie, this point was reached on his first return home from school. For months the boy's spirit had been broken, and his young heart crushed. On reaching home, he found father, mother, and brothers all anxiously\" waiting to greet him. The first intoxicating embrace from all round, and the few moments of unspeakable delight which followed, produced a happiness never again experienced. There are haply many moments in one's life that shine forth as brilliant beacons of light and happiness ; but surely the leading one must be the return to a peaceful home after the first separation, before the affections have been given elsewhere, or any outside friendship has yet been formed, and when father and mother are ideal deities, and brothers and sisters part and parcel of oneself. During the holidays, byT degrees, Charlie's grievances 2"], [24, "18 VAGABOND CHARLIE. and general treatment at school were duly discussed, and without any indignant remonstrances the lad was quietly removed. CHAPTER III. The next move in Charlie's career was that he went % live with a neighbouring clergyman, while waiting nis turn to get into a large public school. During these few months he succeeded in acquiring very little book knowledge, but he picked up a lot in the way of poaching, and fighting, and other country pursuits. Evidently he had more talent for these than for any thing else. Well-taught by his big brother, his strong ooint was fighting, and in this he showed great aptitude. He went to his second school well prepared to hold his own amongst other small boys like himself, and ready, if need be, to assert his rights amongst some of the bigger ones. The eventful day when he was to start arrived, and this time Charlie was driven in his father's own carriage, which of course he thought was a much grander mode of travelling than going by coach. His eldest brother went part of the way with him, and, much to the amusement of the coachman, before saying good-bye, he had Charlie out of the trap, and gave him his final lesson in sparring. He dined on this day with one of the dames of the house, and was afterwards turned adrift to shift for himself. Hitherto, Charlie at home and Charlie at school had been two quite different boys ; at the one"], [25, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 19 place crushed and sat upon, he was merely a walking doll in jacket and trousers ; at the other he thought himself half a man, and gave full liberty to his naturally vivacious disposition. But now coming fresh from his home, and from the freedom enjoyed during his private tutorship, he felt quite equal to fighting his way through any number of boys. The first time he went into the playground, he saw assembled at one end of it a crowd of boys ; he started at once for this, and pushing his way into the middle, there found a small fire, and two men repairing gas pipes. No sooner had Charlie got to the fire than he was recognised as a new comer, and shouts of \"A new boy !\" \"A new boy !\" arose on all sides. He was pushed from one to the other, each saying, \" He is no child of mine,\" \" Does your mammy know you're out ?\" \" Your father is not a glazier !\" and so forth. Very irate at being thus roughly handled, his fight ing powder began to explode. \"Can you fight?\" said one boy. \" I should think so,\" said Charlie, Whereupon the cry was, \" Lawes ! Lawes ! where is Lawes ?\" until in front of Charlie stood a boy consider ably his senior, taller by half a foot, and proportionally stronger. This formidable opponent answered to the cries : \" Here I am, who wants me ?\" \" A new boy ! a new boy ! says he can fight !' Upon this Lawes stepped forward and gave \"the coward's blow.\" This was an established blow between the shoulder and chest, and is equivalent to throw ing down your gauge in knightly combat ; it is a 2\u20142"], [26, "20 VAGABOND CHARLIE. challenge that could not be refused without one's being branded as a coward. Now Charlie had been taught the true principle of \" La boxe,\" which is, to hit straight and hard, return quick, and keep your eyes open. Acting on these rules, scarcely had Lawes' challenge-blow reached its destination, when he (Lawes) felt his arm forced on one side, and a splendid right-hander planted full in his face, quickly followed by numbers two and three. Before he could look round he was driven against a wall, and there for a few seconds his face stood the brunt of a shower of blows, if not very powerful so quick and well-delivered that he never himself struck a second blow, but put his hands up to his face, and went off howling with his tail between his le\u00b0-s meta phorically speaking. Charlie then followed up his advantage by deliver ing a good sound toe-er to that said tail, thereby astonishing the bystanders as much as it warmed Lawes. It was clear from this little performance that Charlie not only knew bow to fight, but was quite ready for the amusement at any moment. Being made the hero of an hour, he took his turn as a sort of champion to challenge all new-comers to juvenile combat. He won his spurs not only by his encounter with Lawes, but with several more victories gained in the course of a few days, and these exploits firmly established his character as a boy not to be lightly meddled with. Here let me remark on the good in spite of the evils of fighting. To a man or boy who strictly observes the rules of"], [27, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 21 the ring, there is no such thing as foul play. A fight properly arranged amongst boys becomes as much a matter of fair play and honour as anything else which calls forth a display of pluck, strength, skill, and nerve. To those who disapprove of fighting and think it degrading and brutal, let me ask :\u2014 \" Are they not ignorant of the rules of the ring ?\" which have for their basis a certain rough code of honour and even humanity. At Charlie's school, a boy learnt that un der no circumstances whatever may he strike a woman ; must never strike a blow with anything but the fist ; never hit an unfair blow, i.e. below the belt, or with out due caution ; never strike a blow from behind, nor hit a man when down ; never kick, and never be the first to begin. These are some, but not all of the lead ing rules of fighting. Whether all fighting men are guided by them or not is another question. Any boy at Charlie's school with the smallest pretence to manli ness or honour, would have felt himself abased if he had departed from any one of them. An exception was made in the case of a small boy being attacked by one much older and stronger ; the defendant might here use a little shinning and kicking, but on no account biting or scratching. Charlie had learnt all this from the days he could walk ; and it would be no bad thing if the lesson could be made a little more universal amongst grown-up men, who, in a passion, seize the first handy thing to heave at their enemy; it may be \"half a brick,\" or it may be something worse. Some may say this is all very well for the strong, but a bad look-out for the weak ; so perhaps in theory it may be, in actual practice it is not."], [28, "22 VAGABOND CHARLIE. How very often it is the weak puny consequential little beggar that makes all the row, and creates a dis turbance, when there is one, whilst the strong and powerful look calmly and smilingly on, not using their strength unless obliged. If a man knows he can thrash his opponent, he does not want to fight. It is the little fellow who would like to thrash his man and can't, that generally gets into trouble. There are bullies of men as well as bullies of boys ; they are exceptions, and make no rule. Two days after Charlie's various battles, he fell sick and was absent for three weeks or more. It seemed that whilst he was away a kind of campaign was formed to out-man\u0153uvre him. The first day that he came back, some little boy gave him cheek and got a good licking, whereupon a big brother was sent for to administer a like dose to Charlie. Unfortunately this physician came without his diploma and got a worse hammering than the younger brother had received. Many more attempts to prevent his rising from Squire to Knight were made without avail. He very soon reached a much higher position in the school than he was entitled to, lording it over and commanding lots of boys nearly twice his age and size. This was a very fictitious authority, yet one which he managed to hold out of doors at any rate. In the. school-room, Charlie was nowhere ; you could not call him a dunce or a lout, and yet he never seemed to learn anything, and re mained in his original class long after others had moved up. With all his assumed valour he sometimes got worsted;"], [29, "23 VAGABOND CHARLIE. on one occasion in particular this was the case, viz., on the receipt of his first grub parcel. Attached to the school premises was a large covered building, in which all or any of the boys could keep a play box, small or large as he liked. Curious and various were the dimensions of some of them ! On Charlie's birthday, he had sent to him from home a good plain deal box with some tuck in it. Previous to its arrival, he arranged with two others to plant this box in a spot reserved for it, and then to feast himself and a few friends on its contents at their leisure. So much for good intentions ! This is what really hap pened. Directly this box came in sight, a general rush was made by a lot of big boys ; Charlie and his friends were bowled over, the box seized and carried off to a distant part of the grounds, and the key roughly de manded. This, Charlie with his usual pugnaciousness refused to hand over, never dreaming force would be used if threats failed. With very little hesitation, two or three heavy kicks disposed of any necessity for either lock or key ; then began a general distribution of cake, oranges, jam, bis cuits, and apples \u2014 not by Charlie, but by his hungry schoolfellows. Not one bit of anything was offered or allowed to be touched by its lawful owner, save and except a loving note written by his mother, and with this only he had to console himself, whilst his grub was eaten and his property destroyed. To wind up matters, the box, being emptied, was voted too good for a small boy, and there and then was kicked to \" smitherines.\" The ringleaders of this very successful raid gave"], [30, "24 VAGABOND CHARLIE. Charlie a few encouraging slaps on his back, and went nearly as far as calling him a capital fellow, and then left him sitting with his mother's note wet with tears on the broken bits of his box, sadly wondering if they could ever be put together again. It was a lesson to him to do without a box, and to have no more grub parcels. In the future he never took part in the waylaying and pillaging of any one's box, but there could be seen a slight glimmer of satis faction on his face when other unwary ones got caught in the same trap. Raids like these were of constant occurrence, and it required, in miniature, quite a military genius to get commissariat supplies successfully landed and pass them safely through the enemy's country (viz., the school playground), and to place them securely in the fortress of a boy's box. Once there, all was safe enough, such a thing as breaking open another boy's box would have led to direct expulsion. In Charlie's case, his box was looked upon in the light of a hamper, because it was captured in the act of transit, and never reached its ideal fortress. Hence there was always a party of boys on the look-out for what were to them goods contraband, and their scent was so keen that they could sniff out the approach of many a parcel long before it reached the gates. Directly it passed the boundary line be tween them and the outer world, they came down on it like a dinner. Tom Brown has so thoroughly exhausted the headings of public school life, that it would be waste of time to recapitulate scenes so familiar to all who have been public schoolboys, and"], [31, "25 VAGABOND CHARLIE. yet it may be a true inference that every large school has its peculiar weakness or vanity. In Charlie's school the crowning point in this respect seemed to be unbounded liberty, a liberty which was either given or taken, it didn't matter much which ; for, if any place was proscribed, it was surely there hundreds of boys would go. Distance was calculated by an estimate of time ; for instance, some three and a half or four miles off there was a large steep hill with glorious sloping sides for sliding down, and it was so steep that the remount was a matter of very stiff climbing on hands and knees. On whole or half holidays, on this hill would often muster two or three hundred boys, the only attraction and amusement being to sit down on the top and make the descent by a slide, they let themselves go slowly at first till the steam was up, and then down they went at the rate of ten miles an hour. A jolly party they became after the first half-hour, some going up, some down, some half killing themselves by rolling over, and yet never breaking a bone. It was no uncommon thing for Charlie and many others to do this between the hours of two and four p.m. Let some boys of the present day fancy lads, varying from nine years old to fourteen, starting off with their jackets and waistcoats rolled up under their braces behind like knapsacks, and then doing nearly four miles out and four home, and having had about two slides down the hill, to say nothing of the mount up, all in time to answer their names by roll call at four o'clock. This would make at least a good"], [32, "26 VAGABOND CHARLIE. ten miles in the two hours ; and it was not done for a bet or a wager, but simply for the sake of the four minutes' delight in sliding down the small green moun tain, and because it was a hard thing to accomplish. This was the sort of training that formerly produced soldiers and sailors, \" who would go anywhere and do anything.\" There was lots of competition, minus the examination, in these struggles. The boy who could get one more slide out of his turn was thought much of, and if he got two or three and yet saved his bacon, he was a hero. Bird-nesting was a great rage, and the boy who could find the rarest eggs, climb the highest and most difficult trees, and travel the longest distance in the shortest time, was amongst his schoolfellows a little king. Perhaps this is not exactly what he was sent to school for, but it is a moot point whether he was not training himself for future contingencies, and making himself more practically useful than some of those who took the lead in the school-room and were out of the match altogether in the field. Charlie was by no means perfection even in play, consequently he was not head-boy, but at any of these games he was generally amongst the first rush, and moreover, was sufficiently so to become of some mark."], [33, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 27 CHAPTER IV. After some five years of this rough and tumble sort of existence, Charlie's father thought he had best try his hand at sea life. One afternoon a message came from the dame of his house to say he was wanted ; after a, little friendly surprise, he found his brother had come to fetch him away at once. In two days he must go to the Admiralty and pass his examination for a naval cadetship. The examina tion of a candidate for the Royal Navy was simple enough in all conscience, and yet plenty of boys were sent down the first time. But with all Charlie's lark ing and frolics he had managed to pick up enough to keep level with ordinary boj-s, so he passed with fly ing colours, and very soon got orders to join the guard ship at Woolwich. His father had been in the service before him, so for a week or ten days all kinds of preparations were made to start the boy ship-shape and taut. He learnt to box the compass, and was instructed how to get in and out of his hammock, and many other things useful to know, though it must be remarked they are very different when taught by a loving and affectionate father to the real thing itself which has to be learnt by experience. It so happened that Charlie had never even seen the sea or anything like a ship. Except in books and pictures his knowledge of the living waters was strictly confined to the neighbouring canal and the river he had bathed in. His ideaiof ship architecture"], [34, "28 VAGABOND CHARLIE. never went beyond his Noah's ark and a canal barge. He had been told he could not see over the sea, so that he had some confused notion of coming upon a high wall of water too lofty to look over, and he pictured to his fancy how to get upon the top to reach a ship ; he wondered whether they used ladders, or staircases, or what. You will see by this his knowledge of geo graphy was somewhat limited, and yet he could have answered glibly enough as to what constituted an island, peninsula, cape, or promontory. With these somewhat erroneous ideas, Charlie left home to obey his first Admiralty order, and it was with no little pride that he walked out of an outfitter's establishment in London, rigged out in his undress uniform. The very word \"uniform,\" sounded talis manic to the boy, as if now he really was a Queen's man ; he already fancied himself capable of perform ing unheard-of deeds of valour. It greatly distressed him not to have his sword or dirk buckled on at once, but the golden crown and bright new buttons were something \u2014 of course he thought everybody noticed him as he swaggered through the streets. Alas ! how soon these reflections were disturbed by his journey down the Thames in a penny steamboat. All the way the boy kept wondering what were real ships and what only toy ones \u2014 by which he meant those that stayed at home employed in river traffic, and those that went all round the world. He couldn't ask any questions, for the idea of a live naval cadet wanting to know a ship from a barge or a punt was too ridiculous, even for simple-minded Charlie. \"At any rate,\" he thought, \"I shall soon"], [35, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 29 find out when we get to Woolwich and see a man-of war.\" Moreover, his heart was a very warm and affectionate one ; spite of all his outside bravery the boy was very sorry to leave his home, and shrank within himself from contact with the world. Oh, you fathers and mothers ! when you see your boy leave home with a smile upon his lips, and per haps his last light words ringing in your ears, do not let the thought arise in your minds, \" He cares not for us, his thoughts are on the wide wide world, and no longer for dear old home. Our nestling is fledged and flown \u2014 never again to be the confiding, trusting, loving son !\" But rather look inward, and as you feel 3'our own hearts yearn after your boy with an earnest loving wish for one more last and tender farewell, be lieve this : that just as strong and mighty as is your emotion to bow your older and greyer heads, so equally powerful is the intense desire on your boy's part to turn back and throw himself on your necks, and to weep out all his grief upon the only earthly hearts from which he knows there will surely come a warm response. All this feeling Charlie experienced, but he had to gulp it down and hide it from those around, for they would have only laughed at him and called it unmanly or womanish. Charlie's brother had accom panied him thus far, and perhaps the most trying moment was that when he stood on the quarter-deck of his first ship, and waved his hand to the departing boat that carried away the last link of home. There was nothing for it but to do as he had done before at school, namely, make the best of it \u2014 bar the fighting \u2014"], [36, "30 VAGABOND CHARLIE. for now, in Her Majesty's uniform, he must not strike his brother officers. Turning sadly round he faced a kindly, silver-haired old man, who stood over him with a look of tender concern, as if he, too, was mindful of that far-off day many years ago, when he, like Charlie, was \"forced from home and all its pleasures.\" No one can tell how keenly the iron must have entered the soul of this veteran as he softly bade the boy go below and make himself acquainted with the cock-pit, adding quite audibly : \" My dear little man.\" Down went Charlie into the region of semi-darkness, and found one midshipman asleep on the lockers, and a dirty-looking cabin-boy (half steward ana half ship's company), who told Charlie the young gentlemen were all on shore, and that he might do as he liked till five o'clock, when tea would be ready. Waiting some two hours or more in the dark hole of a frigate's cock-pit was not a very lively introduction to the service. Disagreeables fortunately come to an end with time and patience, and by five o'clock the long-awaited tea was produced. Alas ! what a misnomer. At the appointed hour, four youths made their appearance, loudly calling upon the dingy-looking cabin-boy for tea. In reply he placed on the table a very seedy-looking tin tea-pot, a plate of ship's biscuits, playfully called bread, and bearing a strong resemblance to. a thin specimen of the biscuits Charlie's brother used to put in soak for his dogs. Added to this there were three or four chickens of the Digby tribe \u2014 these are a class of herring, smoked, dried, and charred, till they taste like a"], [37, "31 VAGABOND CHARLIE. curious mixture of tar, smoke, and oakum, with just a sufficient dash of red herring to swear by. It strangely puzzled Charlie why these two nasty eatables should have such palatable names ; a Digby chicken is about as far removed from any of the feathery tribe as an ant-bear or a mammoth. This sumptuous repast nearly turned Charlie sick, partake of it he could not, though his messmates seemed rather to enjoy it. After tea they adjourned to the main-deck. Amid ship, between two guns, some chairs, a bench, and spittoons were placed ready for the officers who cared to smoke. Most of the senior officers were on shore, and there were present only the kind-hearted old doctor before alluded to, and the five middies. Charlie, of course, smoked ; indeed, he considered himself rather an adept in the art, because he could smoke a whole cigar without being sick. Under the influence of tobacco Charlie loosened his tongue, and, by re hearsing some of his school exploits, soon won the confidence of his messmates and forced from the doctor his favourite expression : \" My poor dear boy, my poor dear boy.\" Three of the mids had leave to go on shore, and they prevailed on Charlie to accompany them. When landed, the two seniors proposed having a more substantial tea than what they had already consumed in the shape of bread and chicken. There fore steering straight for a well-known eating-house, they ordered a good solid meal, to which ample justice was done all round, Charlie, this time, playing as good a knife and fork as any one."], [38, "32 VAGABOND CHARLIE. On the disappearance of the last mouthful of any thing good on the table, Charlie's three companions quietly put on their hats, made a hasty apology to him, and a polite speech at the bar, and bolted. He, suspecting from their manner they were up to some little dodge, ran to the door just in time to spy them making off as if for their lives. Charlie was in splendid condition for running, so he bent to it, and soon over hauled the others. As he neared them and called out to them to stop, they only ran faster and faster, and dodged about through all sorts of back streets and alleys, but it was no go. At each turn they found Charlie only a yard or two behind them, enjoying the exercise as well as themselves. After a good burst, when they found it impossible to get away, they hove to, and as Charlie -came up, they said : \" Well, you little beggar, have you paid for the supper ?\" \" No,\" said he, \" of course not ; I don't mind paying my share, but I won't stand the lot.\" At this there was a loud laugh, and a proposal that all should go back and settle the account. It then dawned upon Charlie's verdant understand ing that their little game was to leave him alone to pay for the supper, and get back to his ship as best he might, minus a good bit of pocket-money ! Foiled in this, they contented themselves by persuading Charlie to stand treat in a straightforward manner, and very liberally he did so. The boy was by no means stingy, and when properly called upon, spent his money freely, but he objected to being outwitted."], [39, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 33 The events of this evening opened his eyes not a little to the fact, that boys at school and boys in the Queen's livery differ very little ; in the way of eating and drinking theyT all like a good blow out, and possess most elastic stomachs. The next morning an order came down for Charlie to be sent on board a steamer to join his prop er ship (a three-decker), then sailing under the flag of an Admiral of the White in the Mediterranean. In the afternoon he was transferred to a small man-of-war steamer as a supernumerary cadet, and the same evening sailed for Plymouth Sound. The agony poor Charlie endured that night can only be realised by those unhappy boys who have gone through similar discomfort. Amongst much kindly advice which the boy had received from old hands, some of whom ought to have known better, was this \u2014 Never mind the weather, only remain on deck and brave it out, and you won't be sick. A greater delusion and more fallacious advice could hardly be suggested. Just fancy a lad, who had never smelt salt water or a sea breeze, squatting on deck all night a little abaft the paddle-box of a by no means first-rate sea boat in half a gale of wind, and going down Channel with a beastly cross chopping sea, and having nothing on to protect him but a monkey-jacket, and being as sick as a cat the whole way. This was how he had been told to brave it out ! Silly boy ! if he had turned into his hammock he could not have been more sick, and would at least have kept warm and out of sight of those nasty horrid-looking seas which would keep 3"], [40, "34 VAGABOND CHARLIE. running up and curling all round the ship, and to his eyes, threatening instant destruction. Cold, wet, miserable, and utterly dejected, the boy watched with anxious eyes the approach to Plymouth Sound, and very thankful he was to get once more into quiet water. The kind-hearted captain, probably looking back on his own first night at sea, gave him a pat on his back, and told him to go ashore, and not come off till sundown. All Charlie did that day was to walk about the streets, look at the shops, eat oysters, and send a few lines home describing how happy he was, and what a jolly life a sailor's must be. The voyage out to Malta, where it was supposed Charlie's own ship would be, was without any very lively interest. They stopped a few hours at Gibraltar without the chance of going on shore ; and this was the only break to the usual monotony of board ship routine. The captain's kindness towards Charlie was very marked ; he was let off night watches, and treated very leniently during the day. When Malta was reached, it was reported that the whole fleet had been ordered to Naples. All super numeraries had therefore to be transferred to the guard ship, there to await a chance of being forwarded on. The time spent at Malta was jolly enough ; no regular dutyand lots of friends on shore made it very enjoyable. One midnight adventure somewhat startled our hero's nerves. It was generally understood that, provided all youngsters came on board by the last ship's boat, no questions were asked as to how they spent their evening. Charlie and two of his messmates very often visited some billiard-rooms and other places of"], [41, "35 VAGABOND CHARLIE. amusement till a late hour. One night they had over stayed the time, and reaching the jetty, had the mor tification of hearing the click-click of the oars of the ship's boat half way across the harbour. Few boat men were about, and these asked extravagant sums to put the boys on board ; so that two agreed to go and sleep at an hotel. Charlie had only a few shillings in his pocket, and, thinking to do the thing cheap, decided to go to a friend's house some little way out of town. This necessitated his taking a guide to show him the way ; he thought this would be cheaper than hotel charges. The Maltese boatmen combine the two trades of sailors on sea and guides on shore, so one of these, Antonio by name, graciously offered to guide Charlie for a sum three times as much as the job was worth. This agreed upon, off they started ; the guide, with a small hand-lantern, went a few paces in advance. After the few streets familiar to Charlie were passed, it became pretty evident that the direction taken was not exactly the one calculated most readily to bring him to his friend's house. He tried to explain this ; but the only reply was some unintelligible gibber ish. Presently, at the corner of a by-street, Antonio stopped and gave a peculiar low whistle, which was immediately answered by the appearance of two lan terns, and a soft pit-a-pat of feet belonging to two men, who whispered a few words to each other, and then fell to the rear. Antonio continued on his way, probably, rejoicing. At the next cross street another signal produced two more lanterns, borne by friends or companions of the party. These two, without any 3\u20142"], [42, "36 vagabond CHARLIE. parley, fell to the right and left of Charlie. If he felt some misgivings at previously having his retreat cut off, he now felt doubly uncomfortable on finding each flank supported by a guard of honour, with which he would gladly have dispensed. Remonstrances he felt would be vain. He did en deavour to explain that he had only engaged one guide, and did not want more. So far as it was possible to understand their speech, he made out that they repre sented themselves as aband of brothers going the same way to their homes. All Charlie could do was to walk rapidly on, and take his chance for what might turn up. He now sadly regretted that his moral courage had not been strong enough to overcome the schoolboy weakness which had prevented him from frankly ac knowledging to his companions the state of his finances, and borrowing from them, and had caused him instead to start on the wild errand of looking up a friend's house, at one o'clock in the morning, in a place like Malta. None the less, visions of heroic valour rose before him, in which he pictured himself standing with his back to a wall and challenging his five attendants. On the other hand, he reflected that he had no weapon, and, although good with his fists amongst lads, he felt they would be of little use just now. If only he had his sword, then he might make a stand ! As yet these men had shown no sign of intended violence, though, from their shoulder to shoulder style of sur rounding him, their continued whisperings and con sultations, together with the various unaccountable twistings and windings they chose for their route, left"], [43, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 37 little doubt in Charlie's mind that they meant mischief. It was painfully clear that they only wanted to reach -some quiet available spot, if not to actually murder him, at least to relieve him of all superfluous property. The boy thought much of the band and crown on his cap, which, he thought, would be greatly dis honoured if left in their hands. Of money he had only a trifle, but there remained his watch and pencil case, and sundry articles he highly valued, and deter mined not to part from without a struggle. He had been long enough in the island to know that these fellows usually carried knives, and were not over-scrupulous about using them upon either boys or men. He made up his mind, if the smallest chance occurred, he would stand at. bay with the bare possi- bility of some one coming to his aid in case of a scrim- mage. Luckily the chance came sooner than he ex pected. His guides, whatever their intention, may have been miscalculated their distance. At any rate they passed through a small square, the whereabouts of which Charlie had some slight notion of. Beyond this he positively refused to budge, and, as if to aid him in this determination, there came by a corporal and file of the guard on their rounds. It was the act of a moment to step up to these soldiers, with the view of putting himself under their protection. Yet, so strange is human nature, immedi ately he spoke to a fellow-man who could understand him, all sense of danger vanished, and he was once more able to act for himself. It would never do for an officer to show signs of fear, so he merely asked the way to the nearest hotel. This the soldiers readily"], [44, "38 VAGABOND CHARLIE. pointed out. It was not, they said, above twenty yards off, and then they continued their rounds. Charlie had quite recovered his self-possession. His five followers did not fully understand what had passed with the soldiers, yet were somewhat discon certed when thejT saw him advance direct upon the hotel. Perceiving his intention, they formed them selves in a semicircle and walked backwards between him and his object, gesticulating, and vociferating, and thrusting the boy violently back when he attempted to advance. He, emboldened by the sight of the hotel and supposed nearness of soldiers, made a rush, hit out right and left, fought his way through, reac lied the hotel entrance, and rang violently at the bell be fore they could prevent him. Out-man\u0153uvred, these wily natives commenced a parley, half friendly, half hostile, by which they relieved Charlie of every penny he had about him. He was only too thankful to get rid of such cut-throat rascals at any price, though having given them all he had, he left himself in a dilemma as to payment in the morning. This difficulty he over came by rising early and making as though he would take a stroll before breakfast ; he did not, however, return, and so he escaped payment. The same day Charlie sailed for Naples. On relating his adventures he got a good wigging from his seniors, and threats of exposure to his captain, unless he promised faithfully to square his hotel account when he came back to Malta. The boy had no intention of wilfully defraud ing any one, and gladly fulfilled his promise months afterwards. The ship he was now on board was a small steamer"], [45, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 39 similar to the one in which he had come out. They lay one whole day off Messina, and witnessed for some hours an attack upon this town, for there was some kind of row going on amongst the Sicilians, Charlie did not know exactly what about. It was great fun to him and the youugsters to watch the effect of some well-directed shot, which in the distance they could fancy had done more than usual mischief. These boys thought only of the jolly row a good big shot must make when it brought down a house or two ; the destruction to property and loss of life did not enter their heads. They passed Stromboli, a small volcanic mount, a little after sundown, at a time when an eruption of more than average violence took place. The sight astonished Charlie not a little, as the smoking peak of Etna was the only thing of the kind he had yet seen. The captain approached as near the island as was consistent with safety, and silence prevailed throughout the ship, whilst all hands stood gazing with wonder at the marvellous sight before them. How puny and in significant appeared the human artillery they had looked upon in the morning, compared with the huge natural gun now belching forth from fathomless batteries tons upon tons of rocks and stones, sufficient it seemed to rebuild half-a-dozen Messinas. Arrived at Naples, the ship was put in quarantine, and ordered to deliver letters and some light cargo, then to return to Malta. It was vexing to Charlie to see his ship, the finest in the British navy, within gun shot, and yet not be allowed to join."], [46, "40 VAGABOND CHARLIE. He watched how the letters were each one cut through and fumigated, and how gingerly the boatmen handled the money, which was passed to them in a basin or hand-bowl of water. An officer from one of the frigates came alongside and asked for some cigars he expected. He was told he could not have them unless they were taken out of the boxes, so he laid an open sail at the bottom of his boat, and, as each box was opened, the cigars were emptied thereon ; even the bands which kept the cigars in bundles were not allowed to go with them. By the time all the boxes were emptied the boat was as full as it could hold, and left the ship laden to the water's edge. Such a heap of tobacco was an unusual sight even amongst the sailors, and, as the boat passed several ships, many a man turned his quid and said he would like to try one of those \u2014 and very probably he did. The loss by breakage in this free and easy transfer must have been very considerable, and doubtless many an honest Jack Tar smoked one decent cigar in Naples Bay that year. This boat-load of cigars was peculiarly tantalising to the officers on board the flag-ship, who, in deference to a wish of their admiral, had magnani mously refrained from smoking except on shore. Two days only, and a return voyage to Malta gave Charlie another respite from regular duty. He had seen nearly the whole fleet and become familiar with the different rig and build of the ships, and he was proud to notice that his ship was superior to all, the flag-ship itself not excepted."], [47, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 41 CHAPTER V Another transfer to the old guard-ship at Malta, with the chance of remaining there some weeks, was not the best school for a boy. Luckily a philanthropic lieu tenant took especial interest in the youngsters, made them come to school, and taught them the ground work of their profession. He was particularly kind to Charlie, made quite a pet of him, gave him much sage advice, took him over the various places worth seeing in the harbour, and, in fact was quite a father to the lad, and kept him a good deal out of harm's way. It was here that Charlie witnessed one of those fearful gales that happen once in every four or five years or so round about Malta. For three days and two nights the fury of the wind and violence of the waves was something to be remembered for a life-time. To give the reader some faint idea of the havoc made by this storm, or \"Regalia,\" it would be as well just roughly to state the main features of the harbour. The entrance is very narrow, with stone fortifications on either side, having their lowest tier of guns within thirty or forty feet of the water's edge. On the right hand side lies the main town with esplanade ; on the left are several bays or creeks \u2014 the first bay is usually full of merchant craft ; then comes the dockyard creek with guard-ship, government buildings, and docks. Beyond this the coaling depot and wharf. Without any great pretence to accuracy of description, it is sufficient to notice that before reaching the end of the harbour three or four natural breakwaters offered pro-"], [48, "42 VAGABOND CHARLIE. section to vessels in bad weather, and, when once inside, on all ordinary occasions, the water was as smooth as a mill pond. During these quinquennial or sextennial gales, in no part of the harbour was a ship safe from damage. In the one now spoken of, a large government steamer^ lying alongside the coal wharf, was lifted bodily up and nearly landed high and dry, and a tremendous hole knocked into her bottom. The first bay on the left of the entrance had no less than sixteen foundered vessels. The esplanade was broken up for hundreds of yards, numerous buildings destroyed, and many guns of the forts dismounted, gun-carriages, hand-spikes >\u25a0 and fittings were washed out to sea, huge gaps made in the embrasures, boats of all sizes floated bottom up or were water-logged ; ships were adrift, cruising about on their own account, smashing everything in their way, and knocking themselves to pieces. The morning of the second day the harbour pre sented a most tragic sight. So continued was the roll and crash and foam of seas upon seas from the outside,. that the entrance could scarce be distinguished amidst the mass of breakers, and the two forts looked literally under water. Inside, amidst such a sea as Charlie would have deemed impossible, there floated and sank a curious medley of things appertaining to ships, and forts, and warehouses. One large bark seemed to take a peculiar delight in roaming about amidst some smaller vessels, crashing in one here, sinking another there, and making a regular free fight of it, till she smashed her own back on the jetty or esplanade. Fortunately, sufficient warning was given to enable"], [49, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 43 most of the crews of these ships to get on shore, and abandon their crafts to the mercy of the storm before it reached its height. A brigantine schooner, with four hands on board, had been caught napping, or else the men were ignorant of their danger till too late. Charlie and his friendly lieutenant spied this vessel fast drifting on shore, close under one of the forts ; they ran round to the ramparts, from which the lieutenant was enabled to make out that the men were Swedes. No boat could possibly get alongside. While thus they rode within speaking distance of those on land, and only a wave between them and instant destruction, by some miraculous intervention the anchor gripped just at this extremely perilous moment. Then, through the active instrumentality of the lieutenant, help was promptly given, and the four men were happily saved ; the ship lived out the gale with a million odds against her, and actually received less damage than many of her neigh bours. Soon after this Charlie went on board an eighty four gun ship, found himself once more bound for Naples, and now began life in earnest as a midshipman. Hitherto his work had been a mere apology, now he was put on regular watch, had his daily log to write up, ship's course and distance to reckon out, and much more that was new to him. The captain was one of the old school ; previous to his present command he had been, it was said, eighteen years ashore. He had some peculiarities attached to bygone times, which he could with difficulty shake off; one was, that he could not remember that port had been substituted for lar-"], [50, "44 VAGABOND CHARLIE. board \u2014 this, and like mistakes, led to considerable tittering and amusement amongst the ship's company. When shortening or making sail, his words of command often commenced, and more often ended, in expres sions familiar enough amongst sailors, yet not exactly first-rate Queen's English, nor rightly comprehended or appreciated by either officers or men of a newer and more refined school. Charlie used sometimes to stand aghast and wonder if the ship was handled better this way than by the first lieutenant's more moderate method of issuing orders. New or old style left little to choose however, for a smarter ship of her day didn't float. On board this ship Charlie first saw a man get \" four dozen.\" This old-school captain believed in the cat, and would have used it pretty often had his inclination alone been considered. A somewhat sentimental impression crept over Charlie when he saw all hands on deck, a grating rigged up by the mainmast, a parade of boatswain's mates, each with a new cat of his own, and the master at-arms ready to tally the number of lashes. Silence being called, a short speech from the captain explains the painful necessity of the case : \u2014 that the discipline of the ship must be maintained, that he regrets as much as any one being obliged to carry out this punishment, but for example' sake it must be done, and, \" By Gads sirs, if there is any more of this sort of thing I will sling up the whole ship's company. Seize him up ! and boatswain's mates, do your duty.\" The prisoner is led to the grating, divested of his shirt, out of which garment he creeps with a piteous"], [51, "VAGABOND CHARLIE 45 expression of countenance, and thus stripped, he is made fast by arms and legs. Loud and sonorous come the words one, two, three, up to six, and terribly dis tinct each blow descends upon the victim, who writhes and twists whilst his flesh is crossed and recrossed with streaks of livid blue and red. The first cut only raises the skin, the rest eat into the flesh. At each half dozen the command is \" another boat swain's mate,\" and forward steps a fresh castigator, probably stronger and able to make the \"cat jump\" more lively than before. If he only happens to be left-handed so much the better for the punishment ; for this process literally cuts diamond-shaped pieces out of the man's back. At the end of two dozen there is a slight pause, the doctor feels the\" man's pulse, orders him to drink a glass of cold water, and the treatment proceeds. At the fortieth lash the man gets faint and, unused to such torture, his head falls back, his eyes close, and he looks like one who feels not, and yet there is a visible shrinking at each lifting of the cat, and an agonising quiver as it descends. On the com pletion of the four dozen he revives sufficiently to utter a groan \u2014 a groan of exultation. Released from the grating, he can scarcely\" stand, his shirt is flung loosely over his raw-meat-like shoulders, and he is led off to be placed in irons down the fore cockpit, a place of darkness by no means cheering at any time. Down here crept Charlie and other youngsters to study the effect of flogging. They heard the prisoner give vent to the most horrible oaths and execrations against captain, officers, and the whole crew. So much for the maintenance of discipline, thought they,"], [52, "46 VAGABOND CHARLIE. but wisely kept their own counsel. Once more at Naples Charlie was at length transferred to his right ship, and here he discovered that a pretty taut hand was kept on the youngsters. A naval instructor on board, regular school hours, no end of sword exercise, gun drill, knotting and splicing of ropes, and a very limited amount of leave. Charlie was much struck with the animated appear ance of the bay at night crowded with fishing-boats. In the bow of each boat was a brilliant fire, so fixed as to cast its rays immediately on the surrounding water. By the light of this one, and perhaps two, spearmen would stand and harpoon fish. The sight of these half-revealed, half-hidden, weird-looking forms caused Charlie to build many a midnight castle in the air, or rather upon the sea. The songs of the boat men possessed for him a melody, a sweetness and charm peculiarly fascinating. CHAPTER VI. One morning the admiral signalled \" Prepare for sea,\" and at gunfire from the flag-ship, like magic the fleet unfurled sails, weighed anchor, and left the bay. Out- side, Charlie's ship and two others were ordered to proceed to Baia Bay. Here the youngsters had much more liberty. Nearly every day some kind of party was made up for the purpose of bathing, or shooting, or visiting the sights of the neighbourhood ; such as \"Nero's\" baths, where there is a hot sprino- some"], [53, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 47 hundred feet deep or so, into which, for the benefit of any one who desires, an old man or woman will let down an egg, and it comes up hard boiled in the space of a few minutes. Numerous are the hot springs and other signs of the volcanic nature of the country. One large hill, almost assuming a mountainous height, was said to have been thrown up in less than thirty-six hours, and in several places steam and smoke could be seen issuing forth from fissures by the hill or road side. Some lakes hard by were famous for duck, teal, and water-fowl, and many a good day's sport did the boys fancy they had. The country was alive with lizards, and on one occasion after bathing, a boy, with o ut much thought, flung a stone at one of these beau tiful little creatures. Finding the animals quick and apt to avoid the missile the rest followed suit, and, for an hour or more, these boys amused themselves with stone-dubbing Uzards. What commenced as a harmless trial of skill soon degenerated into a whole sale massacre. In the evening remorse fell upon these lads, and after agreeing that they were all a set of cowards, they promised each other that such cruelty should never be repeated. It may seem strange that young lads old enough to know better, should think it fun to slaughter inoffen sive and harmless lizards. Like many grown-up people, in the excitement of excelling one another they thought more of their own skill and amusement than of the pain their rivalry inflicted on helpless living creatures. Charlie never forgot this useless slaughter, which taught him one great lesson, viz., how easily thought-"], [54, "48 VAGABOND CHARLIE. lessness and a desire to excel may lead to cruelty and injustice quite unintentional. It would have been well for him and his companions could this lesson have been more deeply engraven on their light and merry hearts ; though surely it was not in vain that they acknowledged what cruel and silly boys they had that day been. The walks through vineyards and orange groves gave abundant scope for Charlie's romantic turn of mind. He studiously collected any old bits of broken pottery or tile more curious looking than ordinary, some of these pieces he imagined were of great anti quity and corresponding value. The naval instructor proved a valuable aid, but sad disenchanter in these researches. Often the boy would bring him a specimen and explain how he had found it amongst the ruins of some ancient place. This erudite scholar would assure him that it was nothing more than a modern remnant, and that nothing he found upon the surface was likely to be of the old Roman date his fancy pictured. A few weeks in Baia Bay taught Charlie a good deal of his profession theoretically, and he began to think he knew somewhat of sailoring. There was one exer cise he especially disliked and always dreaded ; this was heaving the lead, necessary to learn but not easy to do. He could never make out why they could not invent some less primitive way of securing his body when performing this duty. It was easy enough for a weather-beaten quarter-master to place a girth (what the sailors call a gasket) round his stomach, lean for-"], [55, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 49 ward as far as possible, swing the lead three times round his head and let it go. To Charlie it was a mighty difficult operation. To begin with, unless he kept this gasket quite tight it would slip down to his knees, and then leaning forward was out of the ques tion. In addition to this, there was always the appre hension, and very probable chance, of a rap on the head from the lead, unless the arm was kept perfectly stiff and the line tight. One middy was very sharp at this, and used to chaff the rest a good deal. If any one ducked his head or drew in his stomach, two things Charlie often did, he was bound to come to grief, and it is only a wonder the boy did not crack his skull or fall overboard more than once. CHAPTER VII. It was in the year 1848, when the war of Independence was raging in Sicily, that her Majesty's ship , with others of the fleet, were ordered round to Palermo. Here Charlie saw a little of what civil war does for a country. The town was being fortified and strengthened within and without, the main thoroughfares were bar ricaded and rendered impassable, and, around the land side, ramparts and redoubts, hastily thrown up, gave a warlike aspect to the place. About every fourth or fifth man appeared in some military garb or another. There were marchings and countermarchings, relieving guards, posting sentries, with all the \" pomp and cir cumstance of war.\" 4"], [56, "50 VAGABOND CHARLIE. The task of throwing up earthworks facing the road approaches, was carried on vigorously by all the in habitants. Well-dressed women and little children, conveying the soil in small hand-baskets of every con ceivable size and shape, encouraged the work more b}r their presence and example than by the amount of labour performed. Some little urchins helped on their country's cause by carrying handfuls of dirt in scraps of paper to the works. The return to the city at sun down was celebrated by martial songs and patriotic cheers from old and young. These proceedings somewhat restricted Charlie's \" leave,\" but he managed to get on shore, and to visit the catacombs and gardens. The appearance of human remains placed in niches and cases open to view, was something entirely new to our young sailor's eye. In the entrance vault or ante-chamber two bodies were laid out, one of a man, the other of a woman, both dressed in evening costume, and waiting there to undergo the process of being baked before the en shrining. The guide pointed out how the finger-nails of the woman and beard of the man had grown after death. That such a growth does occur, is a fact, I believe, well known; yet it was barely credited by Charlie and his friends until they met with this evidence, which admitted of no dispute. The baking which each corpse goes through does preserve the form to some rude extent ; but the effort made to present a life-like appearance is most abortive. The feelin\" uppermost in Charlie's mind was one of supreme dis-"], [57, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 51 gust and contempt at what seemed to him the frivolity of playing with death in this harlequinade style. Around him were the relics of thousands of bodies, \"kings and potentates\" and \"men of low degree.\" Of many of these little remained save fragments of tawdry robes and dresses clinging to some shrivelled - up, dried, parchment-looking stuff, that he could scarcely believe had ever been human flesh. There was one body of a small boy in a glass case, whose dress denoted a high order of rank. The face of this boy was true as to shape and feature, but the horse-chestnutty colour deprived it of all natural ap pearance, and its artificial preservation only made it look the more ghastly. Charlie tried to discover the meaning of this peculiar method of enshrining the dead. He could only learn it was custom, and good in a sanitary point of view. This latter may have been the opinion of his con ductor, but, to him, the close, musty, fusty, sepulchral atmosphere was very revolting; nevertheless, if the air could be kept purely confined to the catacombs, probably the man was right. At any rate, there could be no contamination of drains or poisoning of water, such as we often hear a great deal about in places nearer home than Palermo. The gardens were prettily laid out, and must at one time have been exquisitely beautiful. Maybe it was owing to the war or other causes, that they at this time presented a sadly neg-. lected and forlorn appearance. In these gardens was; a labyrinth of limited extent, yet so ingeniously laidi out, that the would-be discoverer of its secret easily got lost and entangled in the narrow paths, whj.cjta 4\u20142"], [58, "52 VAGABOND CHARLIE. wound round and intersected each other in a mar- vellous way. Each path was bounded by a well-grown and impervious hedge, and, at various turnings or end- ings, the wanderer met with a figure, or came to a small summer-house. To most of them was attached some device by which the unconscious intruder got squirted at with water. The removal of a branch, purposely placed across his path, revealed the figure of a man all prepared to let fly, and, on releasing the branch, out came about a quart of water. On the oc- casion of Charlie's visit with his friends, one unlucky boy got hit clean in the eye. The summer-houses were so designed that, on opening the door, the same kind of thing happened, and, to Charlie's amazement, these contrivances and figures were not of the most re- fined order ; in some instances the water was ejected from parts of the figures usually hidden from view. In their pristine dignity many of the figures may have been sound works of art ; seen as Charlie saw them, they looked ill-shapen, dirty, and dilapidated. It passed through his mind that they were possibly more decent in their dirt and uncomeliness than when first set up. Having completed his term of service in the Medi terranean, Charlie's ship underwent a general inspec tion from the admiral, who was proud to compliment officers and men on their sailor-like bearing, and who was quite sure that if ever the ship was called into action, \"every man would do his duty,\" &c, &c, a superfluity of speech which was highly appreciated by all, considering that, in less than six weeks after, the ship would be a mere hull, and the crew would be paid off."], [59, "53 VAGABOND CHARLIE. On the homeward voyage from Malta to Gibraltar it blew a gale of wind the whole way, which gave Charlie a taste of salt water rarely experienced in those calm seas. It took nine days to reach Gibraltar, and although this was not exactly a nine days' wonder to any one else, it was sufficient to make Charlie fancy himself quite the tar. The minage of a midshipman's berth did not permit of more than two days' supply of fresh provisions, consequently he had a full week of hard biscuit and salt horse. First-rate grub when you get used to it, if ever you do, but very hard, dry and indi gestible to a juvenile stomach ; especially would this be so when, at meal-times, the older hands exulted over the munificence of the present supplies compared to what the service was in their day. They would relate how they eat peasoup out of cocked-hat tins, made snuffboxes out of the beef, and tied pieces of fat pork to string, and forced the youngsters to swallow these delicate morsels, and then \" hauled upon their bow lines,\" which created a sad disarrangement of their inter nals. Amidst these yarns of harder times Charlie was keen to observe that these old hands, as if in revenge for past discomfort, helped themselves to the most edible parts of everything. What with the green pieces of beef, and the rusty fat of pork spiced with conversation like the above, the boy eat little or nothing, and was ravenously hungry when he reached Gibraltar. His first fresh dinner was a caution, and the quantity of soft tommy and fresh butter that went down his throat made ample amends for his late fast. There surely must be some affinity between the imaginary"], [60, "54 VAGABOND CHARLIE. horse-marine corps and the main body of midshipmen. What is more common in after-life when two old ship mates meet together and compare notes of old recol lections, than for each to recall some memorable ride they had as youngsters, when they hired a nag at so much an hour, and rode him as hard as they could lay legs to the ground from start to finish ? Why sailors, who are as a rule bad riders, should so often choose this method of exercising their muscles is one of the riddles of life. The Gibraltar horse can go as well as rnost,and, though possessed of some special vices peculiar to the rock, is a far better specimen than the Maltese animal. This latter is usually trained by its owner to smash your leg against a wall, or back itself down some beastly stony bank, or go full tilt at a wall with every demonstration of clearing it, but, oh no, \" not for Joe !\" He stops dead short, and, if the rider is not prepared, he clears it without the horse. The horse looks over to see if he is all right, and then gallops home, or rather round the corner, where his owner, if he has not been all the time hanging on to the tail, meets him, jumps into the saddle, and rides home fully prepared to abuse the rider on his return and threaten any amount of damage if the brute of a horse has scratched himself. To return to Gib. One day Charlie and two friends procured three excellent nags. They noticed a peculiar look of the grooms as they mounted, and fancied that they attracted unusual attention as they rode through the town and across the neutral ground. The sentiy on the Spanish side looked ominously upon them as if they were something more than common middies out"], [61, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 55 for a ride. Nothing offensive occurred till they neared a small village, half way between San Roque and the Rock. As they approached this village they observed a regular muster of dogs, goats, and inhabitants, growl ing, barking, bleating, and gesticulating in a fiendish manner. The horses, kept going at a smart gallop, had by this time got well into their second wind, and a good thing for the riders that it was so. At the pace they were riding there was no time for more than a hurried exclamation as to what the deuce the row was about. None of the youngsters supposed they had any concern in the matter ; one said, \" Let's turn back ;\" but the eldest said, \" What for ? no one can hurt us ; we are in uniform and they daren't. Come along, follow me.\" Increasing his speed he led the way at a rattling pace, and the two others followed sharply in his wake. The village once reached, it was a case of \" run the gauntlet,\" and trust to good luck to pull through. The villagers seeing these three boys not in the least intimidated by their formidable muster, got savage, and lined the road on both sides armed with brooms, and sticks, and household furniture of all kinds. In less than no time the three were riding furiously through a pack of curs and goats, knocking over some, jumping and shying at others, bobbing their heads and swaying their bodies to avoid the various articles flying around them. Lots of the men grabbed at the horses' bridles, but the pace was too hot for them, and it was \" clear the road, or down you go !\" Charlie distinctly saw a man in advance pick up a huge stone and deliberately wait his chance. This man aimed at the horse's head with the intention of"], [62, "\u25a056 VAGABOND CHARLIE. dropping both horse and rider. Had the shot been successful, Charlie would probably have ended his career there and then. A fall at such a pace, and in such a place, must have smashed his skull or broken his neck to a certainty. Luckily the stone missed the horse ; but it struck Charlie on the fleshy part of his thigh with such force as to make him reel in his seat, and lose all feeling in his limbs. How he escaped falling he never knew, and he was agreeably surprised when he found himself and companions safely through such an uncouth rabble. When they pulled up to breathe the horses and examine their condition, they saw that all had come off with only a few trifling bruises not worth caring for, except Charlie, whose leg was bad. They had scarce recovered from their excitement and alarm, when a turn in the road brought them in sight of a party of workmen repairing the road. Here was a fix ; if they went back they must repass the village \u2014 if for ward, they must face this gang of labourers. Being in a state of doubt as to the cause of the hostile de monstration exhibited in the village, they felt it would surely extend itself beyond. After a short consul tation the eldest again gave his opinion in favour of a rush, so for the second time away they went \u2014 but not with equal success. Two rode past in safety, but the third was caught and dismounted without much cere mony. Charlie and the other looked back and saw their companion was getting very roughly handled. Spades and shovels were raised over his head in a threatening way, and one man ran into a cottage and brought out"], [63, "57 VAGABOND CHARLIE. a gun, and was hardly prevented by some of the less sanguinary from shooting the boy on the spot. Mat ters began to look serious, and, whether it came to a question of shooting or merely a rap on the head with a shovel, they determined not to desert their comrade. They rode back and were instantly7 seized upon, torn off their horses and placed in the centre of about as lively looking a set of ruffians as any boy would wish to encounter. There was no making them understand that all three were perfectly innocent of any offence against them or their country. Clearly there was some grievance which they felt acutely, and they were encouraged by several women who joined the hubbub. One woman talked faster,' made more noise, and got in a greater rage than any one. The end of it was that after each one had exhausted his very limited knowledge of French, and added about three words of Spanish (the only ones they knew, and which meant something to eat) all to no purpose, a bril liant idea suggested itself : \" Let us send for the Consul.\" Pointing to their uniform they made signs that the Consul should be sent for, and, whilst awaiting the arrival of this peace-maker a tacit armistice was agreed to. As soon as the Consul arrived all was made plain ; it was this. The very day before, three middies had ridden out on the same three horses, and one of them had ridden over a small child and half-killed it, and none of them had had the grace to pull up to inquire how far the child was hurt. In a cottage hard by lay this child in a precarious state. No wonder that Charlie and his party had met with such an unwelcome"], [64, "58 VAGABOND CHARLIE. reception. After all, these foreign rustics had some cause to be incensed. With the help of the Consul even, it took some time to persuade these people that they were not the three lads who hurt the child although they rode the same horses. They gave up their names and that of their ship to the Consul, and, through him, promised to see justice done to the child ; all this . had to be gone through before they were allowed to remount and depart. They rode gently on to San Roque whilst the Consul went back to the village, and explained to the inha bitants that a free return passage must be granted. At San Roque many were the unfriendly glances cast upon them. The landlord of the hotel told them further particulars of the day before, and advised them to return immediately and not venture in that direction until the authorities had somewhat squared matters. All this, and the pain in his leg, rather spoilt the pleasure of Charlie's ride, though it added much to its novelty. Coming back, the villagers, kept in check by the Consul, contented themselves with setting their dogs at the horses, and emptying the contents of sundry utensils on their heads, some of them not of the most savoury kind. They arrived very late on board, and, having over stepped the limit of their leave, were had up before the first lieutenant. An explanation led to the pro duction of the real offenders \u2014 three of Charlie's shipmates \u2014 who had flattered themselves that nothing more would come of their escapade. When told what others had suffered in their stead they frankly acknow-"], [65, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 59 ledged their share of the mischief. On further inquiry it turned out that the child was as much frightened as hurt, so they sent money to the irate old woman its mother, and there the matter fortunately ended. The trip home from Gib. was by far the pleasantest time Charlie had yet experienced on board. Every one was in good spirits, and all were as pleasant to one another as possible : \" Each thought of home and that welcome dear, which soon should greet each wanderer's ear.\" Alas for one to whom that welcome never came ! It was Charlie's watch on deck, and he stood admiring the smart way in which one of the foretop-men went aloft. As this man reached the futtock rigging a rat line gave way, and down he came with a thud upon the deck within a few feet of Charlie. \" Take that man below, and report his case to me in a quarter of an hour,\" was the order promptly issued by the captain. The poor fellow when picked up could just murmur \" My head, my head,\" and in less than a quarter of an hour he died. This accident cast a temporary shade over the ship's amusements, but sailors don't dwell long upon disagreeables, and they soon fiddled and danced, and made merry as before. A final inspection took place the day after the ship's arrival at Plymouth. Another admiral came on board, saw the men exercised at general quarters, gave another complimentary speech, and then commenced the work of stripping ship. It took some ten days or so to get everything out of the ship, and, on one of the last days an incident occurred that might have cast a far deeper gloom upon all than did the loss of"], [66, "60 VAGABOND CHARLIE. the foretop-man. Whilst getting the iron water-tanks over the side, some of the tackling gave way and a tank swung in-board, struck the captain, who was alongside, on the chest and knocked him clean down the open hatchway, with a fall of more than forty feet below. By the greatest good luck, in his fall, he managed to catch the combing of the hatchway with the tips of his fingers. For one second every hand seemed paralysed, the next they were recalled to life by the captain's own voice calling out cheerily, \" Never say die, my boys, whilst there's a shot in the locker.\" This momentary check was scarcely sufficient to enable a man on the upper deck to grasp him by the collar, and had it not been that another on the main deck caught him round the waist with just enough force to drag him clear of the hatchway his chance of escape would have been small. The discipline of the ship and the coolness of the captain were markedly shown by this accident, which so nearly ended fatally ; it was only known to the bystanders, and little or no comment passed upon it afterwards, except an expression of admiration at the pluck of the commander. The day the ship was paid off, Charlie, on landing, was greeted by his energetic friend the lieutenant, from Malta, who was busy trying to persuade all the youngsters to go on board the flag-ship in the harbour, rather than home to their friends. A capital idea for a man anxious to get on in his profession, but rather hard lines for a lad who cared more for his friends than the service. The notion did not at all chime in with Charlie's ideas. He borrowed three pounds from his tailor and cut home as fast as he could \u2014 havinc"], [67, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 61 cleverly eluded her Majesty's customs with respect to twelve pound odd of \" baccy.\" CHAPTER VIII. Whatever Charlie's views of the sea when afloat, to gratify his own pride and the feelings of his father and mother, he kept them to himself. He gave the most glowing accounts of sailoring generally, but inwardly hoped something would turn up to prevent him ever joining another ship. For six weeks he thoroughly enjoyed life with his eldest brother, riding, shooting and visiting friends, who one and all petted and made much of the young sailor. This side of the picture was pleasing enough. One fine morning an ominous-looking letter con veyed the unwelcome intelligence that he was forth with to proceed on board a twelve-gun brig to Halifax, there to join the flag-ship. Poor boy, what a double part he had now to play ! After all his fine speeches and silly affectations about the sea, how his heart smote him every hour as the time for his depai-ture drew near ! Curiously enough, it was arranged that he should leave home on a Sunday. His father and mother were by no means strict Sabbatarians, yet they were the last people who would choose that day for starting their boy in the world again. As a salve to their con science the lad was first taken to church to say good bye to the old vicar, who had known him all his life,"], [68, "62 VAGABOND CHAELIE. and who had done many kind things for him, and then his brother took him to the raihvay station and saw him off for Plymouth. It is only some thirty years ago, and this is how Charlie was despatched. He was put into a second class carriage Avith nothing on but his blue sailor's suit, no monkey-jacket, greatcoat, or rug of any kind, but with a goody booh in his hand. Here the poor boy was supposed to exist till he reached Plymouth, a journey of eight or nine hours\u2014 and this in one of the autumn months ! Probably the goody book, whilst adding comfort to his soul, was intended to supply warmth to his body \u2014 if so, it was a miserable failure- When the train got to Plymouth in the early morning Charlie was half-frozen, and but for the kindness of a fellow-passenger, who took compassion on him part of the journey, he would probably have been made seriously ill. At the Devonport Hotel, Charlie was soon introduced to some of his new shipmates, who had also availed themselves of the extreme limit to their leave ; they had come down by the same train, and were waiting for daylight to go on board and sail the same day. Again Charlie experienced the great discomfort of not regularly belonging to the ship, and of being classed amongst the supernumeraries. The ship was dreadfully crowded ; sixteen boys and men were to inhabit, for an indefinite period, a midshipman's berth capable of holding conveniently about eight. At no one time could all hands get even standing room therein. A double watch for breakfast, dinner, and all meals, was a necessity ; and, whether on duty or off, Charlie"], [69, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 63 and other youngsters seldom got inside this blest abode. What time they had below was spent on their sea chest, or they coiled up and made themselves small anywhere. Over-croAvding was not confined to the midshipmen and officers \u2014 the whole ship's company was nearly double what it ought to have been. A large detachment of marines and supernumerary blue jackets filled every available space by day, and at night-time, when the hammocks were piped down and slung, it was as much as you could do to pass your hand between them, and when the men turned in there AA'as barely an inch of spare room for any one. Charlie never had a hammock at all, but made a rough shakedown on his chest with a very smelly marine at his head, and a lot of savoury companions all round. In fine weather this mattered very little, all hands were ready to help one another and make the best of it ; still, both sailors and soldiers growled and grumbled with an extra amount of gusto \u2014 they could not be brought to see the exigency of any service that jammed such a number of men into one ship when they ought to have been in two. The captain and senior officers were very good-natured, and did all they could to make allowances for the crowded state of things, and they permitted many little indulgences that would otherwise not have been thought of. Charlie's great ambition was to see a real hurricane, such as he had heard described and read of in books> and this was amply gratified during his voyage to Halifax ; about half-way he saw the wildest sea and nastiest weather he could desire, for two days and nights the A^essel lay like a log upon the water."], [70, "64 VAGABOND CHAELIE. A continuance of dirty-looking weather prognosti cated a storm of unusual violence, and preparations were made accordingly. The striking of topmasts, bringing down lower yards, and all top hamper to make all snug for heavy weather, gave Charlie a good lesson in seamanship, and opened his eyes to what might be coming. When the ship lay to, under storm staysails, to his unexperienced eye it seemed almost certain she would be swamped. During the middle watch of the second night the storm was at its height, and, for four hours, Charlie was about as panic-stricken as any boy need wish to be. The hatches were closely battened down, and to get on deck was quite a gymnastic feat \u2014 when there it was a case of \" hold on by your eye lids.\" Life-lines were rigged fore and aft, and every man of the watch was made fast, or was holding on for his bare life to something. The captain and master, made fast to the weather rigging, anxiously watched for the smallest abatement of Avind and sea (rain there might or might not have been). The vessel, heavily laden with supernumerary stores and cargo, as well as human beings, had no life in her, and could not rise to the waves, consequently sea after sea would break over her, and now and again she would appear completely deluged. Charlie was so appalled he scarcely noticed how wonderfully a ship, even laden like this, does live out such fearful strains put upon her. He felt, as he watched the tremendous seas all round, and saw them culling up and rising, as it were, immediately over his head, that surely such mountains of water must prevail"], [71, "65 VAGABOND CHAELIE. over so small a craft of human structure. At the very moment when all above and around seemed bent on destruction, there would come a fearful heave and a lurch, as if from some invisible power beneath the waters, which would lift the ship about two-thirds of the way up these liquid hills; the remaining third would come with a crash of thunder right over the vessel. For a few seconds she would \"stagger and reel to and fro\" in earnest, only to settle down into another trough of sea to be again surrounded, uplifted, and deluged, with perhaps increasing force. A night-time of this is long enough to satisfy the greediest salt-water dog. However brave a man may be he must feel, if he feels or thinks at all, how utterly futile and powerless are his grandest efforts to control the elements. He may be allowed to rule the sea a little, to go and come in all weathers, but only just so far and so long as he is permitted : at. any moment, if the fiat goes forth, his power to rule is gone, and he truly learns \" how vain is the help of man.\" None of these thoughts need prevent him using the knowledge and courage he possesses, yet they prove how this mighty force of sea and wind may combine to cower even the hearts of British seamen. Often, in moments of danger, men may learn true courage from boys. On this night something went wrong with the foretop, and, as well as could be heard through the din and roar of the elements, the captain ordered some hands aloft. For some moments it was scarcely credited that such an order could be given, when the very mast itself was tottering, and the rig ging, one minute slack and hanging in a bight, would 5"], [72, "66 VAGABOND CHAELIE. the next tauten up with a sound like broken harp strings; the men, grasping for their life some stan chion, or \"bit,\" upon deck, could hardly realise the possibility of going aloft. Whilst they stood irresolute and with murmurs on their lips, not daring to disobey, and yet fearful to move, a young middy \u2014 whose post of duty and command was in the foretop when required\u2014 sprang forward and re-echoed his captain's command. He was some twenty ratlines up the rigging before his stupefied subordinates felt the power of his example and the sting of his sneers as he called upon them to follow him, even should the mast go by the board. The panic was but momentary \u2014 when,' headed by this noble boy, some six or seven men dis appeared for a time through the blinding spray and sea. They performed the task allotted to them, and returned to the deck to receive the well-merited com pliment from their captain of \" Well done, my lads,\" and the gallant youngster was marked for special commendation. How curiously are boys as well as men acted upon by unknown forces ! This lad, who had really done a noble deed, thought it natural enough. Simple obedience to command was his motto. Being afterwards questioned, he said his feeling all the time was rage with his men for hesitating in danger, for himself he felt no concern until he once more reached the deck in safety ; but he confessed to feeling that his last hour was come when, on the fore top, at each lurch of the ship he seemed to go right down into the sea ; spite of this, when one man showed fear and was not so smart as he might hav"], [73, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 67 been, the boy took up a rope's end and hit him over the head to bring him to his senses. It is devoutly to be hoped that the race for steam and metal will not outrun such deeds as this. Our navy was full of such lads, and is so still, if only they have a chance to prove themselves. At sunrise, to the relief of every one, a break came, and by mid-day the ship was once more riding the water in comparative safety. The loss of quarter boats, bulwarks stove in, foremast sprung, guns dis mounted, loose spars drifting about, two miserable sheep more dead than alive, and sundry other debris, betokened on deck the strife she had passed through. Below, things looked no better; in the lower deck there were some eighteen inches of water. Sailors' and soldiers' kits floated about amongst mess-tins, buckets, boxes, and officers' chests, and all were huddled to gether in a wonderful medley. The stink was no trifle, considering the hatches had been down for eighteen hours. The atmosphere had become condensed to such a stage that a London November fog would be pure air in comparison. Poets sing of \" Spring's delicious air;\" few, if any, will forget the draughts of \" strong Atlantic \" they so freely imbibed on board this ship ! Charlie, at least, retains a lively recollection of its knoek-me-down density, together with the one ham-bone and nimble biscuit he managed to secure out of the wreck of dinner that same day. In the afternoon a large object was sighted on the horizon, and various speculations were rife as to what it might be. Some said, \" a ship in distress ;\" others, 5\u20142"], [74, "68 VAGABOND CHAELIE. \" a boat,\" and the more imaginative suggested \" the sea-serpent.\" The captain at once altered his course and bore down upon it. Just before dark, it was made out to be a ship dismasted, and entirely at the mercy of the waves. By the uncertain twilight it was difficult to see if any thing alive remained on board. A roughish sea was still running, so it was not advisable to sail too close. It was the general opinion that the ship had been abandoned ; nevertheless, on the bare possibility of finding life on board, the captain felt bound to stand by and render help if needed. Nothing alive could be seen, and no reply was made to the signals hoisted, and, now the darkness had set in, no answer given to rockets and blue-lights, which were kept going to show the relative position of the two ships. As they neared each other and came within hailing distance, each man's heart quivered with emo tion. There was something indescribably touching to Charlie in beholding this forlorn vessel, thrown out into bold relief against the dark background of sky and sea by the illuminating lights of his own ship. The pent-up suspense of unknown anxiety was broken by the voice of the captain, \" Ship ahoy ' what ship is that ?\" No reply gave even a temporary relief, though it was yet uncertain whether any brother's life was there awaiting the friendly hand of another to restore animation. Doubtless many a one thought of the late perils they had themselves passed throuoh.aud conjectured the sad fate most likely to have befallen those who so lately trod the deck of the hapless hulk"], [75, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 69 before them. A boat was lowered, and the first lieu tenant with difficulty got on board and examined the wreck. She proved to be a water-logged timber-ship from Boston. No papers were found, nor any clue to account for her abandonment. The captain said she would make a capital target, and at daylight he would beat to quarters and put a broadside into her, but a sudden shift of wind altered his determination, and when daylight came no sign of the deserted vessel could be seen. CHAPTER IX. In due course Charlie joined the flag-ship at Halifax, and again came under the regular routine of school hours and general instruction in addition to day and night watches. Of his life here little need be told ; it was varied, like that of most youngsters, with plenty to do on board ship, and a run on shore most days. He made great friends with an assistant surgeon who took him many a jolly shooting and fishing trip, and who be haved like an elder brother to him. He was awfully disgusted with the Nova Scotian idea of eating oysters. Thinking to have a good relish after the hard fare coming out, he, with two others, went to an hotel and ordered one and a half dozen oysters apiece, expecting that they would be served up English fashion in their shells. The waiter was rather dilatory in executing this order. At length he"], [76, "70 VAGABOND CHAELIE. produced three bowls, each containing eighteen oysters promiscuously floating about in their own slime. A more disgusting-looking dish could scarcely have been presented. They called for the landlord and refused to look at, much less pay for or eat, such revolting food. He as sured them there was nothing uncommon in this method of serving oysters, in fact it was quite the correct thing, and pay they must. They paid their money and took out its value in good free and easy nautical abuse, which led to their summary ejection. At a ball given by the admiral and at other enter tainments, Charlie remarked that the oysters were not dished up wholesale, nor did he ever see them served in this manner again. The fact of its being a custom of the country rested entirely on the evidence of the landlord, and this he somewhat doubted. On the approach of winter, the fleet set sail for the West Indies, making Bermuda its first station. Bermuda was not half a bad place for the youngsters, lots of cricket, capital boating, dignity balls, and bath ing afforded plenty of amusement. Bathing occasionally gave rise to no little excite ment in the way of sharks. It is a pretty safe rule that a shark will not attack any large number of people in the water, but he will hang about the outskirts and pull down any one rash enough to swim away from the rest. On this account it was a standing order never to bathe alone, or with- out a sufficient number to scare away these brutes. One morning, a large fellow was seen to be caught and hauled on board a neighbouring ship. When the"], [77, "71 VAGABOND CHAELIE. bathing hour came, it was a matter of no small im portance who should be the first to jump in. Having just seen one of the dreaded enemy captured within hail, there was considerable doubt as to the advisa bility of bathing at all, especially amongst the young sters. Here again a mere lad set an example to many very much his seniors. It was one of the youngest who took the first plunge, and his boldness imparted confidence to the rest. The water was so clear you could often see com pletely under the ship, and it was curious to notice how small in comparison looked the part below the water-line to the wall-like sides with masts and spars above. To Charlie's eye it seemed as if the merest puff of wind would turn her bottom up. A great feat by one of the best swimmers on board was to jump from the main-chains and dive under the ship. To see this done in such crystalline water ap peared nothing, but if you calculate the height of leap to be twenty feet depth (to the ship's keel) rather more, and the breadth sixty feet, it will be seen that this was no ordinary performance, and one that even this splendid swimmer did not often indulge in. Several hardy mariners could jump from the bow sprit and flying jibboom-end, and more than one from the fore-yard arm, but none could dive like this man, who was a West Indian by birth. He differed from the showman's celebrated hippopotamus, inasmuch as he lived very well on land, and very well in water, but not so very well in his board-ship cage. The island, or rather cluster of islands, at Bermuda {it is said there is one for every day in the year) are"], [78, "72 VAGABOND CHAELIE. entirely surrounded by rocks and shoals with the excep tion of one narrow entrance. It is a pretty sight to stand on some prominent height and to watch the rise and fall of the breakers over the hidden reefs, which in moderate weather form a circular band of foam round the island. The place is admirably adapted for a prison, and it was probably on this account chosen for a convict settlement. Once inside there is small chance of escape. Attempts to escape have been made, but none successfully ; on one occasion a party of run aways got as far as the outer reef on the north side ;. here they capsized and lost their lives. In Charlie's time there were some thousands of con victs who lived in old hulks by night and worked on shore by day. Many of these prisoners made very pretty ornamental things,such as letter-weights and ink stands, from the various quarries. Those of good character were allowed to dispose of their handiwork to visitors, and in this way, combined with a small government gratuity for length of service and general good conduct, some, when released, were enabled to start life afresh with a little capital of their own ; and let it be hoped that they avoided a second introduction to Bermuda. At Halifax Charlie had written home a most touch ing appeal to his father, asking to be taken out of the service. To his great relief a favourable reply reached him at Bermuda, together with an official despatch ordering him to be brought home in a six-gun bri<*an tine schooner, one of the smallest ships in the navy. The commander was an old lieutenant of thirty-nine years' service, and by far the greatest martinet Charlie had yet come across. He was one of those disappointed"], [79, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 73 men, fortunately now rare in both army and navy, but in that time plentiful enough. He entered the service as a poor boy without any official interest and no special merit of his own beyond doing his duty, and he had to watch, with what patience he could muster, many younger and wealthier men pass over his head time after time. It sorely vexed his spirit, narrowed his mind, and destroyed his temper. A good specimen of the latter exhibited itself on leaving Bermuda. The only point of ingress or egress to the harbour is through a passage called the Narrows on the S.E. side. This passage is so narrow that two ships could hardly pass one another. The man-of-war schooner sailing down the harbour sighted the mail-steamer well out to sea, and the lieu tenant-commander thought there would be ample time to get clear of the channel before she came up. The mail-boat captain was probably of the same opinion. Spite of signals and a gun fired from the schooner, both ships advanced so far that there was no retreating, and a meeting in mid-channel became inevitable. The situation was no joke, and gave all on board a lasting impression of what a fearful thing a collision at sea must be for any small vessel, if run into by a steamer. Had the little ship been anything but a first-class sailer she must have been run down. However, by very clever handling she managed to lay off just enough to let the steamer go by, but it was touch and go. She struck twice on the coral rocks, and the main rigging of the steamer caught her fore-yard-arm in passing. Charlie stood just abaft the helm, and as he looked"], [80, "74 VAGABOND CHAELIE. down he saw the rocks stand out clear and dis tinct only a few feet below, and towering above came a great black ironshod monster so near that he could have thrown his cap under the paddlewheel, the heavy wash of which threw his ship on the reef. How they felt on board the steamer Charlie never learnt. The fury and rage of his own captain knew no bounds ; he danced about and swore he would put a hole in the steamer's bottom. He ordered three of his little pea-shooting guns to be loaded, and it was as much as the second officer could do to prevent this threat being put into execution. The perilous position of the ship, more than anything else, demanded the immediate attention of its irascible skipper. By the time he had extricated himself from his difficulties, the mail-boat was safely at anchor. Charlie was only a passenger and had nothing to do but look on and feel very thankful that the result was no worse. It gave him a good chance of noticing the beauty of the coral reefs, and the marked way in which nature, so to speak, had designedly left one entrance to these otherwise rock-bound islands. A careful examination proved that no particular damage was done. The little schooner, when well out side, caught a good ten-knot breeze, and came spanking home at a fine rate. For one night only she had to lay to, and the difference in this small craft, compared with others Charlie had sailed in, was something glorious. She rode the water like a duck, and hardly shipped a sea ; it was a treat to be on board of her. She ran home to the Lizard's in seventeen days, one"], [81, "75 VAGABOND CHAELIE. of the fastest trips on record at that time for a sailing ship. It was a bitterly cold November night and blowing great guns when Charlie reached his home. He felt very like a naughty boy who had acted, if not told, a lot of stories, and hardly knew how he would be received. Poor boy ! often in his night watches had he pictured to himself the disappointment his return would be to his father, who had evinced such love towards him, and was so proud of his sailor boy. He need not have doubted the loving embrace of both father and mother ; they pronounced complete forgiveness, and he felt fully restored to his happy home. At the very time he was seeking admittance his father, half-awake and listening to the wind, said, \" I wonder where poor Charlie is this night ?\" never dreaming he was at the moment only a few yards off. Some may say this was mere chance, but to Charlie's mind, it was a certain sign that the agents of an unseen world were guiding and directing him. It was easy to say of course that the father thought of his son ; but Charlie wondered why the tongue should have given utterance to his thoughts only a few seconds before the wishes of his heart were realised."], [82, "76 VAGABOND CHAELIE. CHAPTER X. After some two years of time spent not very profit ably to himself or satisfactory to others, Charlie arrived at the mature age of eighteen with no very definite future in view ; but his head had been for some months past full of the golden news from Australia. He came home one day and found his father in a state of excitement over a flaring advertisement of a famous clipper ship, which had made the passage out to Melbourne and home again in little over five months. In a week or ten days this ship would sail again from Liverpool. Directly Charlie entered the room, he was greeted with the words : \" Well, my boy, I have found a ship for you ;\" and as an accompaniment to the ex clamation he had the paper thrown to him. He read over eagerly the cleverly-worded account about \" the shortest passage on record ; capital accommodation, and moderate rate of fare ; this chance not to be lost,\" &c, &c. It was settled at once that his passage should be taken, and that he should try his luck on those far-off shores, which are bright, golden, and sunny to a few, but leaden and disappointing to many. The next week was spent in continual bustle and preparation. He did one hard day's work in his father's garden, and another with a cousin, lopping and felling fir trees by way of proving to his friends that he had the real stuffin him ; but the difference between this amateur performance and the reality was after wards somewhat marked."], [83, "77 VAGABOND CHAELIE Saying good-bye to old familiar places and faces brought many a tear-drop to the lad's eye, but re membering that he was eighteen, and feeling him self already an embryo digger, he speedily brushed away these boyish weaknesses. The only time he fairly broke down was when parting with his two younger brothers, with whom he had spent a farewell day at their respective schools. It was strange to him that on this occasion he was more overcome than after wards when saying good-bye to his father and mother, whom no son could have loved more. Twenty-three long years have passed since then, and from that day to this these three brothers have never met together again, and Charlie has long ceased to wonder why he was so deeply affected. How often does the heart, that has borne its part and carried itself bravely through some great trial, give way under a minor difficulty so completely as to surprise itself. The sum allowed for Charlie, after paying pre liminary expenses, was the munificent one of twenty pounds, which was to be given him when fairly on board ship and out of docks. This was a precaution by no means unnecessary with such a slippery card as he had of late proved himself. After all adieux and tender farewells, some of the latter rather more tender than he would like to confess, he started with a letter of introduction to a Liverpool merchant. This man of business fed him like a fighting-cock, bought what few things he wanted to complete his kit, and the following day saw him on board, aud handed over to him the twenty pounds. Here let us look around, and see with Charlie's eyes an immense con-"], [84, "78 VAGABOND CHARLIE. course of people assembled on the quay, to give a final cheer to the good ship and gallant captain, who had so lately won such laurels. It Avas said that wagers to the amount of many thousands were laid upon the ship's being home again in less than five months, and that the run out would be accomplished in sixty days. It was currently reported that the captain was largely interested in backing his ship. On shore it looked as if half Liverpool had turned out to wish good luck to all on board. There was the usual scrimmage of passengers looking after their baggage, getting into their appointed cabins, sailors stowing away the last of a miscellaneous cargo, loosen ing sails, securing boats, &c, &c. It was an hour or two before the vessel got fairly away and was cast loose from the two tug-boats that had toAved her clear of all shipping, and left her sea room enough \"to paddle her own canoe.\" Each one then began to scrutinise the other, and a mental counting of heads took place : the actual number on board was about eight hundred souls \u2014 seven hundred and forty-nine emigrants, besides the ship's company. In the saloon, or after-cabin, were forty-nine first class passengers, and the remaining seven hundred were second and third class, and a rum lot some of these were. The last bit of excitement was, that a police-boat came alongside with two detectives in search of some one or more wanted on shore. They did not come with out their secretary's warrant, but it was a fool's errand so far as their taking any one back with them went. Whatever the flaw in their indictment, all the good"], [85, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 79 or harm they did was openly to warn the captain and his crew that they had on board a well-known gang of pickpockets and sharpers to the number of some forty or fifty. They pointed out two of the ringleaders amongst the first-class passengers. Rather a lively look-out this, at the beginning of a long voyage ! As no one can be condemned till he is found guilty, the captain could only caution these would-be appro priators of other men's goods that they had better mind their eye as he intended to keep a sharp look out upon them. This forewarning did not give much assurance, nor did it serve to keep numbers out of the clutches of the adventurers. One would naturally suppose that, being so openly held up to scorn, the sharpers would have played a close game, and kept themselves aloof from the rest. Not so at all, money was their object, and money they got, and in a manner not to be gain said. The first week things went on quietly and smoothly ; rubbers of whist, vingt-et-un for mild stakes, friendly chats on deck, stories in the smoking rooms, acquaintances formed, great attention paid to the ladies, and such universal good feeling exhibited, that it was like a floating happy family. The first two Sundays divine service was performed and well attended fore and aft. Each particular creed and de nomination found its circle of devotees, and used its own peculiar service. Charlie belonged to the Church, and was an atten tive listener and worshipper, with a goodly congrega tion following its familiar liturgy. If all the Sundays had been like these two there"], [86, "80 VAGABOND CHAELIE. would be little to say on the subject. Alas, another week saw \" another sight !\" It was noticeable day by day that the quiet games became more exciting, the moderate stakes gradually increased, and numbers of the men began to get un steady in their gait in broad daylight. Whispers went round that so and so was tight, and that another had paid the piper to a heavier tune than he had whistled for. Every day there was a decided falling off in good manners, each seemed to vie with the other (either by tossing, throwing dice, or playing cards) in doing bis neighbour out of a sum or sums of increasing magnitude, until full liberty and license were given to the demons of gaming and drinking. The climax of scandal in this latter respect was reached on Easter Sunday. The pas senger (a married man with five children) who had pre viously taken upon himself to officiate, came forward to the capstan-head, which was temporarily converted into a reading-desk, in such a state of intoxication that he could scarcely support himself, and was quite unable to articulate. Fortunately, the blasphemy of such an one daring to read God's Holy Word was prevented, and the congregation dispersed with feelings of dis gust. A few of the more earnest met below and held their service in decency and order, and continued to do so each successive Sunday throughout the voyage. From this date to the end of the journey might be seen piles of money on the saloon table at all hours. From the time the breakfast-cloth was removed till long after midnight the players never relaxed their pursuit, except for meals. Charlie often saw as much as eighty or ninety pounds on the table in hard cash,"], [87, "81 VAGABOND CHAELIE. and the two sharpers acted as bankers. These two men played their game so well, that in spite of pre vious cautions, they succeeded in keeping on good terms with the captain and principal passengers. In connection with others they carried on a systematic campaign of plunder throughout the ship. So well organised was their party that hardly a case of dispute arose, notwithstanding that the loss in some cases amounted to hundreds of pounds. Two brothers were notably unfortunate, for they dropped about eight hundred pounds between them. It maybe conjectured that this was a bad school for so young a hand as Charlie to begin an adventurous life in. Really, it was the best. Brought up in the highest principles of honour and good breeding, and coming as he did from the midst of social refinement, the shock to his keen sensibilities rendered him proof against the evils of intemperance, and for play he had no taste. Moreover his small sum of twenty pounds would ha\\_e gone but a little way in keeping pace with the rest even had he been so minded. Notwith standing, he was caught one fine day and cleverly victimised. A two-legged shark was throwing dice, apparently for amusement, and he asked Charlie to watch the throws, at first for nothing, and then for half-a-crown. The bait took, and in less than ten minutes the silly boy had lost ten pounds. It was a terribly hard lesson for him, he had to go below and to draw out half of his little capital, that had been up to this time carefully guarded. His father's kind love and parting counsels came home to him with overruling force, as he slowly 6"], [88, "82 VAGABOND CHARLIE. unlocked his desk and counted out his sovereigns one by one, his eyes being so full of tears that he could scarcely see to relock his desk. The knowledge of having been cheated only added to his sufferings, for by no recognised law could he avoid paying. There was just one little gleam of hope that the man, when he saw such misery depicted on his face, might relent and give back part of this enormous sum. Such a hope quickly vanished as he marked the grin of satisfaction with which this harpy pocketed the money. In after-life, Charlie had many much harder hits from the battledore of misfortune ; but this first knock down blow ever stood out prominently as a beacon light to warn him off the rocks of gaming. It did not serve to keep him entirely free from its breakers, but it saved him more than once from actual ship wreck. You may have too much of a good thing and much more so of a bad one. Such close contact with all that was evil and so little that was good, had a salutary effect on the boy's future, inasmuch as it gave him a lasting horror of the ruin and disgrace men bring upon themselves by giving unbridled sway to the momentary excitement of any bad passion. To describe half the things to which Charlie was an eye-witness, would create such a feeling of discredit and revulsion in the reader's mind, that he would cast the book aside as stupidly fictitious ; and yet real life is often stranger and more unaccountable than the cleverest fiction. To return to a more agreeable topic. The captain, whose reputation for seamanship and fast sailing was at its zenith, devoted himself to his duty and did his"], [89, "83 VAGABOND CHARLIE. best to make the good ship fly, and it may almost be said he more than once succeeded. On one occasion he made the run of four hundred and three miles in four-and-twenty hours; on another, during a strong gale he twice carried away and reset topsails the same night. In this gale it was'a grand sight to stand on the quarter-deck and watch the ship as she literally ploughed through the water which was one large sheet of froth and foam. There were no high seas or heavy swell such as Charlie had seen in the northern seas ; these were kept down by the sheer force of the wind. On each side of the ship was a regular wall of water, just such as whalers describe as being around their boats when in full tow of a large fish. It was a new experience of sea-life to Charlie to feel his ship, amidst this war of elements, going at the rate of eighteen or twenty knots an hour, with very little canvas on her. The difference of this hurricane \u2014 lived through in a well-trimmed ship and smooth water \u2014 and the others he had been in was very striking. The cowardice or timidity of sharks in attacking any number of bathers was amply exemplified during a fourteen days' calm on the Line. Nearly every day one, and often two boats, pulled off half a mile or more from the ship with a goodly number of swimmers. That there were plenty of sharks about was evident from the fact of more than one being captured, and the triangular fin of others being constantly seen above the smooth surface of the water. Independent of sharks there was another danger not taken much into consideration, viz., sunstroke, and yet in one case it proved fatal. 6\u20142"], [90, "84 VAGABOND CHARLIE. Charlie was on the poop with others watching the boats alongside, when a man jumped into one with out his hat on. The captain called out: \"Tell that man to put on his hat, or else to leave the boat imme diately !\" Well would it have been had such a humane command been promptly obeyed. As it was, no one paid much heed, and least of all the unfortunate man himself. He was heard to mutter some contemptuous remark about \" minding his own business,\" little think ing they would be his last words upon earth. Scarcely had the boats left the ship when, in reckless defiance of the captain's kindly warning, he jumped overboard. To the astonishment of all, hardly had his feet touched the water when his hands were thrown wildly into the air, his head fell back, and the man was dead. No rifle bullet could have done its work more rapidly or fatally than did this coup-de-soleil. The corpse was instantly brought on board, and all remedies known to the faculty for restoring life re sorted to in vain. Such a sudden and unexpected event cured all hands of any wish to indulge in more bathing. That same evening his body was consigned to the deep. He was a member of the despised frater nity of Jews, and one of those who had made their mark by plundering the unwary. The service being performed in Hebrew, and attended by most of the worst characters in the ship, made the impression more than usually solemn and warning."], [91, "VAGABOND CHAELrE. 85 CHAPTER XI. For several days during the calm, a Dutch vessel homeward bound had drifted about in company with Charlie's ship, and interchanges of civility had passed between them. Invitations to dinner were given and accepted on both sides with a display of good-fellow ship which created quite a regret at parting. On the appeai-ance of the much-wished-for breeze, a heavy bag of letters was made up and given to the friendly Dutchman, and the two ships parted company, having been mutually well pleased with one another. It passed through Charlie's mind : \" If nations could only meet like these two ships in a calm, and get to know one another by personal contact instead of mere newspaper reports, there would be far less antagonism of thought and feeling. The beef-eating shopkeeper would be found not such an isolated lump of pride and money as he is ofttimes represented, and the big breeched, broad-shouldered Hollander neither a bore nor a ' boer.' \" At the end of seventy-two days, on one of those brilliantly calm, soft, moonlight nights so often ex perienced both on land and sea in those latitudes, the Australian shore was sighted. It was about nine p.m. when the cry of \"land \" on the port bow sent a thrill of nervous excitement through the head and heart of Charlie. He spent some time that night in the foretop, gazing on that near distant shore once thought fit for only convicted felons, but"], [92, "86 VAGABOND CHAELIE. now become the welcome land where there was wealth for \"honest labour,\" and \"no more idle sorrow.\" Thinking hopefully of these things, he sang out mer rily : \" Cheer, boys, cheer.\" For two, days all were busy discharging cargo and passengers ; Charlie meanwhile watching and waiting the appearance of his luggage, which he heartily wished he had left in England. The rough off-hand way in which the lightermen did their work, banging about boxes and trunks as if they were so many holystones, argued much against his ever seeing his property safely landed on shore. One poor fellow, a carpenter by trade, implored them to be careful of the box which contained his tools. He received only a rude reply, and the next moment his box was overboard and smashed to atoms between the ship and lighter \u2014 the contents went down like round shot. It was piteous to see the poor man's look, and to hear the cry of anguish Avrung from his wife at thus losing ber husband's best means of earning that live lihood they had come so many miles to obtain. In aid of this hard case, a subscription was at once started amongst the sympathising bystanders, who, to their credit be it said, collected little short of the estimated value of the tools : namely, twenty-five pounds. Charlie did not notice that the men who caused the mischief gave anything. They in no way seemed concerned as to the damage done ; the loss of a pas senger's box appeared to them a matter of no con sequence whatever. The most charitable conclusion to arrive at was that they had themselves landed under the protecting hand of Government, and that all they"], [93, "87 VAGABOND CHAELIE. then possessed was marked with the broad arrow. This might not redound to their credit, but would amply account for their apathy. When it came to Charlie's turn, he got astride of his box, and superintended its transit personally. Passing up the river, he was much struck with the enormous size of the rats. They were as large as rabbits, and quite as tame ; but they were such ugly looking customers that no one would wish to make a nearer acquaintance with them. They looked in splendid condition for giving flavour and piquancy to the dishes at the many restaurants in the neighbour hood ; and very likely many a new chum's first dish of kangaroo soup has been largely composed of yarra yarra rat, which he has smacked his lips over and enjoyed. At this time there was no jetty or wharf for the landing of goods or men ; though one rapidly sprang up afterwards. When Charlie landed it was on a bank some nine inches or a foot deep of black clayey mud \u2014 \" whereon the wild thyme\" did not \" grow.\" The' luggage was thrown ashore much in the same way in which it had been received from the ship, with out any regard to order, or the wishes of those most nearly concerned. It was no joke for these new arrivals (men, women, and children), when sitting ontheir own or anyone else's box, to keep out of the slush ; whilst husbands, brothers, or friends struggled to procure drays or any kind of conveyance for their goods, to go they knew not where. One dray driver, a little more dirty in his face and"], [94, "88 VAGABOND CHAELIE. degage in his dress than the rest, was pointed out as \" once a gentleman.\" To judge from the few words overheard it could only have been \"once.\" He had clearly lost the language of gentility alike with its appearance ; and Charlie inwardly hoped that he should never grow like that, even should he come down to be the driver of a dray. Latterly Charlie had made great friends with an Irishman named \" Rice,\" who had brought out a few hundred pounds worth of goods, beside ready money. Rice would like to have kept Charlie near him, and to have paid his expenses, but delicacy of feeling prevented his making any definite offer, and precluded all likelihood of its acceptance. They parted with the determination not to lose sight of one another ; and in the hope that ere long they would be able to establish a partnership. When the sum of tAventy pounds was handed over to Charlie at Liverpool, no calculation had been made for incidental expenses, such as beer, and wine, steward's fees, and sundry other ways and means of melting money without the aid of dice. Independently of the ten pounds thrown away, the lad was obliged to spend three or four pounds. His balance in hand as he went over the ship's side was five pounds seventeen shillings and sixpence. By the time his box was stored and his first night's lodging paid for, very little over two pounds remained. He landed on the Monday, and by mid-day on Wednesday all the cash he could muster was eighteen pence."], [95, "89 VAGABOND CHARLIE. Feeling anything but comfortable at this discovery, he walked into the nearest restaurant and eat a good lunch. Although prices ran high for most things, food was reasonable; and eating-houses aboundedwhere you could get a substantial meal for one shilling and sixpence. After lunch he met with some shipmates, flush and ready enough to shout, i.e. to stand treat, at the nearest public. Whilst standing at the bar, meditating on his empty pockets, two men came in and fell into conversation with the new chums. It soon came out that one of them was a trooper in plain clothes, who was looking for a man to take his place in the mounted police. His resignation had been accepted on condition that he produced a sub stitute. Here was just the opening for Charlie. Without much preliminary introduction he stepped forward, offered himself, and was readily accepted. In. less than an hour after, he was taken up to Rich mond barracks, examined by the commanding officer, told to appear the next morning by ten a.m., and to consider himself at once enrolled. How different was his exit from the barracks to his walk up. He fairly bounded out of the gate, sought out his friend Rice, borrowed a couple of sovereigns, and they both had a good spree that night. Next morning at the appointed hour he took the oath of allegiance, was provided with arms and ac coutrements, and told off for escort duty, to start next day for the Mclvor goldfields in place of the man he relieved."], [96, "90 VAGABOND CHARLrE. CHAPTER XII. The mounted police-force was then in its infancy, and the difficulty of obtaining a proper supply of arms and accoutrements was great. Charlie's outfit Avas rather amusing; by no means ornamental, and not particularly useful. His carbine (so-called) was of an ancient Prussian type, and it was so small in the bore that no bullets in camp could be found to fit it. When on duty he could only load blank, and either throw away the bullet or put it in his pocket \u2014 which he sometimes did, to make believe that he was loaded if his gun was not. In addition to this formidable carbine he was furnished with a large horse-pistol, which was broken at the stock, and generally so shaky, that only on the extremest emergency would any one like to discharge it. It had this advantage over the musket \u2014 there was a possibility of loading it, and once, for a bet, Charlie made a good shot with it. Horses were much in the same category ; there were a few good ones, but the generality were badly broken and out of condition for the work of escort duty. At evening stables, our newly-enlisted trooper was ordered to look after two horses ; one of them was in tended for riding, and the other to lead as a pack-horse. This sudden entry upon real manual labour rather damped his military ardour. He was not a bad rider, nor afraid to mount any animal in the barracks, but cleaning and littering down are vastly different occu pations to riding. He had often played at stabling"], [97, "91 VAGABOND CHARLIE. under the guidance of his father's coachman, but he found the real thing a very much harder task than he expected. The riding horse was quiet and docile enough, but had suffered terribly from a sore back ; and when handed over to Charlie, had a lump on its withers the size of a small potato. Charlie pointed this out to the sergeant-major and begged he might have another horse, for, in his opinion, this one would knock up on the journey, and he, moreover, thought it cruel to ride an animal in this condition. For answer he received a severe rebuke from the sergeant, with a rude intimation that he, the sergeant, was there to give orders, and not to listen to remonstrances from any one. Moreover, he em phasised strongly the following assertion : \" Look out, and mark my words ; if that horse returns with a sore back, you will be fined for careless riding and inattention.\" His second horse was a picture to look at, but to handle or clean a very devil. She would scarcely let him approach the manger with food, and, whichever way he turned, the brute's rump jammed him up against the stall, and her hind legs lashed out in all directions. It took at least three men to get the saddle-pack fast on her back. When once in the ranks she was all right, and a beauty to lead ; this very essential quality being the reason why she was kept as a pack-horse. On a long journey, and with a valuable commodity like gold, it is of considerable importance what kind of horse you have to lead, both as regards speed and safety. Few things are more trying to the temper than a beast that won't lead."], [98, "92 VAGABOND CHARLIE. One moment he lags behind and threatens to break the rein, or drag your arm out of its socket ; the next he rushes forward and half unseats you, or, Avorse still, jostles and leans upon your leg till he establishes half a-dozen raw places thereon. At daybreak next morning, Charlie, with ten of. his comrades, paraded in full marching order. The officer in command of this small troop looked every inch a soldier, and did not belie his appearance. He possessed to a remarkable degree a thorough knowledge of the country ; how his knowledge had been acquired never came to light \u2014 whether he had once been a settler, or had served in foreign campaigns, no one seemed to know. He seldom travelled the same route twice, and never consecutively, and he had no fixed days for starting. In this way, the time for the actual transit of gold, and the road taken, could never be accurately deter mined on beforehand by outsiders. He was just the man to organise these guerilla-like movements, and to establish a little discipline amongst the raw undrilled troopers whom he was now inspecting. Three of them were new hands like Charlie. It was a glorious morning, though somewhat cold at starting. By sunrise they were well clear of the town and riding briskly along to their first stage, doing fifteen miles before breakfast. The exercise and novelty of the position was exciting and enjoyable to Charlie after his long ship-board confinement. The journey up to Mclvor was divided into stages, varying from fifteen to tAventy-two or three miles. At each halt horses and men were well fed and billeted at some public-house ;"], [99, "93 VAGABOND CHARLrE. the sleeping accommodation was of the roughest de scription. Frequently the horses had no stabling other than a rough shed, no bedding, and the ground fet lock-deep in mud and water. The men were glad of a table or soft plank any- Avher-e, except that a room of some kind to themselves was always provided. It sometimes happened that, at the end of a day's ride, in addition to their escort duty, they were called upon to take up drunken men and rioters. On the way up this was of small consequence, but it was a serious inconvenience coming down. The charge of three or four thousand ounces of gold gave quite enough anxiety and responsibility to even the humblest trooper. It was no particular joke to a raw recruit to have his midnight reflections broken in upon by a riotous lot, demanding that some friend or enemy should be taken into custody. There was always the danger and probability of its being only a hoax to attract the attention and weaken the number of the few men who were guarding the hardly-earned treasure of gold diggers, amounting in value to ten or twelve thousand pounds. Luckily, great faith was placed in the pro tecting arm of Government, and the strength of this escort was never put to the test, much to the relief of those who composed it, a few of whom were no better armed than Charlie. They seldom passed up or down without an alarm of some kind. On one occasion the whole troop was brought to a sudden stand in the hazy light of early morning by the appearance of two forms emerging from"], [100, "94 ArAGABOND CHARLIE. behind the covert of a large tree, who called out in stentorian voices \" Halt !\" Such good use of the material, raw as it was, had been made by the officer in command, that, spite of all shortcomings, a few seconds sufficed to form a rough square, with the pack-horses inside and each rider facing outwards to repel an attack. The alarmists turned out to be only two travellers unexpectedly disturbed in their morning slumbers. Ugly rumours of bushrangers being on the look- out for the escort were constantly afloat ; and it was often predicted that they would get stuck-up. In truth, this really happened to a private escort, which Avas successfully attacked, five men shot down the first round, and all their gold carried off. The robbers gained little real good b}'- this, for, a few months after, they were all taken, and five of their number hung. The two ringleaders (one a notable ruffian of many years standing) were caught on board ship, on the point of sailing for England, where no doubt they con templated revelling on their ill-gotten gains. A large quantity of the stolen property was found in their possession and returned to its rightful owners. Crowds witnessed the hanging of these rascals, and a feeling of relief went round when it was known that they could trouble honest folks no longer. The body of the captain, or chief, was handed over to some real or pretended relatives, and it was commonly reported that they realised a good round sum by exhibiting his corpse to the inquisitive multitude. What will not even enlightened Christians some times do to gratify their sensational palates! The"], [101, "95 VAGABOND CHARLIE. exhibition of a Wainwright, or a Manning, would probably attract greater crowds, and raise more money, than an appeal to the same numbers for any really Christian work. In England we daily read of the crowding of courts and of the general rush for a sight and hearing of some heinous offender against all laws, human and divine. The very patricians of the land are not exempt from such curiosity. The greater and more revolting the crime, the more popular is the excitement or sensation. This need not be wondered at, if the feeling uni versally aroused was one of righteous indignation and disgust. Strange to say, a majority of those who flock round the criminal, do so, it is to be feared, to satisfy their curiosity and to utter mock expressions of sympathy and forgiveness, hardly compatible with their general acceptance of moral law, or of any recognised belief in the ten commandments. On their arrival at the diggings, the escort were allowed one day to clean themselves and settle into their allotted quarters ; and then they took their share of camp duty. Their stay on the fields usually ex tended over a week, and the time was employed with fatigue work, stable duty, and night guards. Charlie's earliest experience of the latter was as follows. He was stationed as number three sentry over what might have been, for aught he could discern, an empty tent. It was supposed to hold either a drunken man, or a woman who had attempted suicide by cutting her throat with a glass bottle. The post of number three was inside a moderate-sized tent, which had two compartments. The part occupied by the"], [102, "96 A'AGABOND CHARLrE. sentry contained nothing but an empty water-keg, the other might have held the prisoner. His orders were, to remain standing in his own compartment, and on no account to hold communication with the next. To this hour, Charlie remains in a profound state of ignorance as to what he was guarding. This want of knowledge did not in any way prevent his stepping smartly up to the tent-door, as each half hour went by, shouldering his blank-loaded carbine, and calling out lustily, \" Number three and all's well.\" Being a neAV chum, and ignorant of the fact that his uniform was a special mark of contempt and derision amongst the diggers, he asked leave to quit the camp for a few hours. Leave was readily granted, but with a visible twinkle of mirth in the eye of the officer, and in those of some of the old ones. The more friendly-disposed advised him not to leave the camp in uniform unaccompanied. To this he paid no heed ; he could not believe that innocently Avalking about off duty could give offence to any one ; he had yet to learn that on or off duty was all the same at the diggings. The dress of a trooper was looked upon as that of a spy, and the Avearer was considered fair game for any amount of chaff and bullying. This ill-feeling was natural enough, for the troopers were largely employed in running down and capturing any one going about without a license. It was this licensing question that led to serious disturbances and bloodshed at Ballarat and other diggings. The law was, that every man should pay a license duty of thirty shillings a month for the privilege of"], [103, "97 VAGABOND CHAELIE. residing on the fields, no matter what his occupation. This pressed very hard upon the unfortunates who found no gold ; it was also a heavy tax upon all, and manifestly unfair, for the prosperous man paid no more than the needy. It moreover applied to all residents, whether diggers, store-keepers, or whatever line a man might choose. To entitle him to a peaceful and unmolested existence from Government, he must pay his license. There were regular days when the troops from camp went round and demanded to see all licenses. It was great fun on these occasions to watch those who had evaded the law scuttle about like rabbits, disappear down one hole to show their head and shoulders out of another, to the intense amusement of their friends, and chagrin of the troopers. A bolder rider than the rest would sometimes follow amidst a perfect warren of holes, only to get inextricably confused, and to find himself powerless to capture the runaway. The best chance they had was at the stores and grog-shops, and along the main thoroughfares. In these places they often made a good bag, and marshalled up an array of indignant offenders. When once in hand these seldom escaped ; and, when arraigned before the High Commissioner, there was no alternative but to pay the obnoxious fee, or live at her Majesty's expense for the space of. three calendar months. Little wonder then that immediately the precincts of the camp were passed, Charlie was greeted with shouts of \" New chum \" and \" Joey !\" When he got 7"], [104, "98 VAGABOND CHAELrE. amongst the shallow diggings, in the innocence of his heart he endeavoured to extract some information from those at work. But wherever he went, showers of mud-pellets, lumps of clay, and a few small stones (some as big as an orange) came flying around him in all directions ; they were sent by the unseen hands of diggers hidden from sight in the earth at a depth varying from three to fifteen feet. It became too hot at last, and Charlie retreated with reluctance, longing for a chance to collar some one and thrash him well. He quite entered into the antagonistic feeling between digger and policeman, and would gladly have had a go at any two or even three of these under ground and unseen assailants. Spite of all this, there existed amongst the better disposed diggers a strong feeling of assurance toAvards the camp and its occupants. Even the rowdy ones were at all times glad to avail themselves of the usually very just decision of the High Commissioner, who held as difficult a post for giving general satisfaction as it is possible to imagine. The disputes which arose from jumping of claims, rights of ownership to property, and so forth, were often most intricate : and yet, if the judgment of the Commissioner was once called in, it was sure to be accepted and acted upon. In this way alone many a serious row was avoided, and, however much troopers individually might be despised, they received on the whole due countenance and support as upholders of right and justice. Whilst Charlie was cleansing his objectionable gar-"], [105, "99 VAGABOND CHAELIE. ments from some of the dirty missiles, he stumbled across an old shipmate who was acting as cook and bottle-washer to a large refreshment tent. This man had been in his way a great swell on board ship. He had served in the Zouaves and seen a little fighting in Algeria, and, by his own showing, he ought to have been made a general. He winced considerably when Charlie hailed him as a compagnon de voyage, and was obliged to confess his present occupation to be no better than that of a cook. However, like an old campaigner, he quickly re covered his equanimity, and he hospitably invited Charlie to dinner, and gave him the very best his establishment could afford, apologising in the most polite manner on his inability to join him. His duty as a cook and waiter only permitted him to keep an eye on his guest and see him well provided. This introduction gave Charlie a legitimate standing amongst the incomers, and he was subject to no greater annoyance than askance looks and ferocious scowls. After dinner, when the ex-Zouave could spare half-an hour for a chat and smoke, he strongly advised his friend to go back at once to camp, and not again to venture out alone in regimentals. He intimated that several men whom he knew to be no good, had eyed him very suspiciously, and that, if darkness came on, he would hardly get back with a whole skin. This advice Charlie thought it most prudent to follow; he had noticed more than one braggadocio-looking fellow with revolver in belt and of villainous appearance, whom he would gladly have tackled by daylight if he could have met them singly, 7\u20142"], [106, "100 VAGABOND CHARLIE. but whom he had no fancy for meeting two at a time and in the dark. The next night it was Charlie's turn for stable-guard. This was not by any means a pleasant or easy duty for any one new to the work. The stable-buildings were open sheds with either slab or canvas sides ; a few attempts at stalls for the officers' horses were formed by bush-poles and uprights. The troop horses were made fast to a long rack or manger with all sorts of devices ; some had head-stalls, others halters, and many only bits of hide tied round their necks. The length of their tether depended entirely on the caprice of each individual trooper. Imagine a mixed number of horses up to thirty or forty, entires and mares ; and that these animals were of varied dispositions and tempers, some being half-broken wild devils, and all crowded into one long shed, and that one man was supposed to keep them quiet. Many of them had a knack of biting through the rope or hide that bound them, and of then roaming about at their will. Often they would be so crowded that there was no room to lie down ; so that if a beast felt sleepy and wanted to rest, he must go through a performance of kicking, and biting, and \"swinging his rump around\" in order to clear a space. As soon as be was down, the ranks would close in upon him, and a fresh riot would com mence. The special duty of the stable-guard was to put down these disturbances ; but how to do it was left entirely to his discretion. In most cases this was"], [107, "101 VAGABOND CHARLIE. shown by letting them all have a wide berth to fight things out in their own way. When a greater row than usual went on and there seemed some chance of a stampede, a sergeant with a file of the guard would come round and help to put matters right. Woe betide the luckless wight on duty when this became necessary, for he was roundly abused by his comrades on the spot, and was had up the next morning as a defaulter and punished. It required a bolder man than most \"new chum\" troopers to go in amongst a lot of gleaming teeth and lashing-out hoofs, with a stable lantern that was sure to go out directly one got near enough to see what the row was. The night-guards were divided into three, and only a given number of candles served out to last the night through. This was all right for the first watch, who could keep up a fair illumination by planting his candles in the best spots from which to obtain a bird's eye view of the whole stable. The second watch could perhaps manage pretty well with what was left. The third, or morning watch, had a very poor chance, and he would husband most carefully one little end, or perhaps two stumps of candle ; for the most part he was quite in the dark, and trusted pretty much to Providence. On Charlie's night there was plenty to do; the horses seemed all adrift. One gave no end of trouble, and nearly knocked down half the rickety built premises by perpetually kicking and worrying the rest. Another kept moving about in a very uncomfortable manner, seemingly in great distress, fidgeting up and down, breathing heavily, and alto-"], [108, "102 VAGABOND CHARLIE. gether being very queer. At length she came to ground in one corner, and there lay moaning and groaning. Charlie's knowledge of horse complaints was some what limited; he thought of gripes, and wind, and such-like ailments; the symptoms of none of these agreed with those before him. Afraid lest the horse might die, he alarmed the guard. Upon further inves tigation, the horse, which proved to be a mare, had given birth to a foal. A veritable mare's nest indeed, and one that gave rise to no end of chaff and ridicule against Charlie for weeks after. Let it not be thought that by thus touching upon the weak points of a force there is meant any dispa ragement or undue sarcasm. The Australian police bears now a reputation quite equal, if not superior, to the renowned Irish constabulary in the physique of men and horses, in the equipment of arms, and in general efficiency aud discipline. From its beginning, although composed of a scratch lot of men from various grades and professions, no branch of it was ever known to falter in its duty. Amongst officers and men there were many who had seen plenty of service, both military and civil, and who kept the young hands in good repute by example and precept. Plenty of scope was given to all lovers of adventure in the pursuit of bushrangers and cattle-lifters ; this led to forced marches, midnight rides, and frequent brushes with the most determined desperadoes. It was no uncommon thing for two bushrangers to stick up a whole part}' of travellers by the simple process of"], [109, "103 VAGABOND CHARLIE. joining their number, and of seizing a favourable oppor tunity of presenting loaded revolvers at their heads, and threatening to shoot the first man who moved, whilst a third would go round and rifle the pockets of all present. \u2022 Sometimes these attacks would be made upon an isolated hostelry, when it was known to be full of those who had the wherewithal to pay for such dating intrusion. Invariably these marauders were hunted down by the mounted police, in most cases successfully, and dangerous work it was. A noble young fellow, acting as lieutenant in command of a troop, was out for ten days, following the track of two well-known bushrangers, and at the sacrifice of his own life he enabled his men to secure the ruffians. At the end of a long day's ; march they camped near to the foe, but unaware of their proximity ; the lieutenant, seeing a light a little distance off, sauntered in that direction with no definite purpose in view. To his surprise he came upon two horses hobbled close by an old shepherd's hut ; peeping through the crevices he espied his long-sought enemies. With a rash but laudable ambition to make his capture single-handed, he, without challenge or hesi tation, kicked down the door, jumped past the threshold, and demanded instant surrender in the \" Queen's name.\" He paid dearly for his rashness, for, quick as thought, the elder of the two sent a bullet clean through his breast, and both thought to make good their escape. Not so. This splendid fellow (only a youth of twenty summers), wounded as he was, struck one man senseless, grappled with the other,"], [110, "104 VAGABOND CHARLIE. and held him down till the arrival of his men, who had hurried to the spot at the report of firearms. The prisoners were quickly secured, but the triumph of the capture was embittered by the sad reflection that it had cost the life of their young officer. They tended him most carefully, and brought him to town by easy stages, and as gently as the rough means at their dis posal admitted. But there was little or no hope of recovery ; the bullet, passing through the centre of one lung, had drilled a hole completely through him, and he lingered only a few days, and then died. CHAPTER XIII. The advantages of high pay, good clothing, and liberal rations (which amounted in the aggregate to an equivalent of five pounds a-week), were not sufficient to bind our roving Charlie for many months. He soon got tired of the life, and resigned. On the road it was pleasant enough ; but, in barracks and camp, to be held by the bonds of discipline and servitude, when all around rejoiced in such perfect liberty and freedom of action, was very distasteful. He felt this most powerfully whenever he returned to Melbourne, and could get out to visit his friend Rice and other shipboard acquaintances, who still hung about town, some idle, and some employed. These would always greet him with a demonstration of friendship and kindly feeling unknown to him in the police force."], [111, "105 VAGABOND CHAELIE. After all he was but a lad ; and previous to his de parture from home he had ever looked up to and clung to his eldest brother, for whom he entertained an intense feeling of love, veneration, and admiration. There was a blank and void about his heart that could only be filled up by a friend, who could in some sense replace his idolised brother. Rice, by his geniality and noble qualities, succeeded in doing so to such an extent that only in his presence did Charlie really feel happy and natural. His short term of police service was utterly barren as regards any approach to friendship with his com rades, for they, being older and made of rougher materials, laughed at the boy's susceptibility, and con tinually wounded his better feeling. On his return to Melbourne, the lad would seize his first spare moment, and fly like a hunted deer to the shelter and protection of his newly-found friend. There was much in these two natures eminently qualified to draw them together, and to cement a friendship not too hastily formed. It was not till the end of the voyage, and when the necessity of separa tion had taught them how much there was in each akin to the other, that they discovered the strength of their friendship. As Charlie would pour out his pent up disgust and indignation at his forced companionship with men so little able to understand him, so would Rice, whilst listening with an ever-ready and sympa thising ear, little by little reveal the hidden springs of his own vitality, and therewith quench the thirst of his younger enthusiast. He would also raise his thoughts to nobler deeds, and higher aims than those"], [112, "106 VAGABOND CHARLIE. entertained by the men by whom they were sur rounded. Rice belonged to a good old Irish family, and was a fine manly -looking fellow, twenty-six years old, six feet high, and broad in proportion, a keen sportsman, and thorough gentleman. He was well versed in the past history and troubles of his country, and was full of patriotic songs and melodies. These were rendered remarkably' stirring by his rich melodious \\~oice, and accurate ear. As he had a warm and tender heart, truly in tune with all he said and sung, it required no effort to see in him a living representative of the scenes rehearsed. Such was the friend to whom Charlie came after leaving the police. He had saved nearly thirty pounds, and was ready to join Rice in any enterprise now he had some money of his own. Like many more, Rice had been badly advised at home, and had brought out his capital in goods without any knowledge of the requirements of the Melbourne market. It took months to get any return in the shape of cash, and then he sold at a tremendous sacrifice ; in point of fact, when Charlie rejoined him, half his little patrimony was gone. Since landing, he had lost time and patience, and had spent a lot of money in vainly endeavouring to establish a business, for which he was in no Avay fitted. He thus made himself an easy prey to all the land-sharks, who were ready to eat up his last sixpence, and then to pitch him overboard. The lodging-honse where Rice had taken up his abode was kept by a countryman who had, in a fit of desperation, jumped at this chance of making a living; and, much to his own surprise, had found it a remark-"], [113, "107 VAGABOND CHAELIE. ably paying concern. His success mainly depended on the support of Irishmen who had known him in the old country : and of this number Rice was one. The clannishness of Scotchmen is proverbial ; but they must yield the palm, or, at least, divide it with Irishmen, for brotherhood or mutual assistance. It was a curious assemblage that Charlie was introduced to the first evening at this house. When all were told, there were seventeen lodgers, three of whom lived in the main building, which consisted of two rooms on the ground floor, and of four little ones upstairs. The two rooms downstairs did duty for dining, and smoking, and for general habitation. Detached at the back was a large wooden store, used as a receiving house for luggage and goods belonging to the lodgers, or to any one else who felt inclinedjto pay half-a-crown a week per package. Above this was a long low room, familiarly chris tened the cock-loft by its occupants. To make plenty of room for the goods below, the floor of this loft was raised to within four feet of the roof, so that only in the middle of it could a man stand upright. Fourteen beds, arranged in such a way as to allow a narrow passage down the centre, left just sufficient space for washing purposes of a very \" lick and promise \" sort. Six basins and jugs answered all requirements for the whole fourteen. To reach this celestial abode, it was necessary to mount a rickety ladder, with its last step but one broken \u2014 a trap that led to no end of broken shins and strong language in the morning hours. No one cared to mend this broken ladder, as it was a constant source"], [114, "108 VAGABOND CHAELIE. of amusement to all. Those who came to bed early enough and steady enough to avoid accident them selves, had many a laugh at the expense of the later ones. Besides the fourteen lodgers, the cock-loft at nMit-time must have contained ten times fourteen rats, quite equal in size to any Charlie had seen on the river's bank. Rats are supposed, as a rule, to shun human society, but these Melbourne rats seemed absolutely to court it; their voracity, playfulness, and sociability were be yond conception. They ate things hard and things soft, nothing came amiss to their hungry maws ; boots as well as laces, woollen clothes and stockings, all alike got damaged. Socks were their especial vanity ; pro bably these were the most tasty morsels. In conse quence of the great expense of washing, and of a glut in the market of hosiery, it was far cheaper to buy socks by the dozen, and to wear them out indepen dently of any laundry. As every one got the most he could for his money out of every pair, when discarded they made capital rat fare. Charlie was particularly pestered Avith these creatures ; night after night they would hold a regular levee round his bed and over his head, until one night a big fellow came rolling into his bed with a lump of sausage in his mouth. It then occurred to Charlie that, for want of a better place, he had established a little store in the rafters, and that, amongst other property, there was a patent soup sausage which he had brought all the way from Eng land, but had never had the pluck to taste. It was this sausage that had made his quarters the meeting-"], [115, "109 VAGABOND CHAELIE. place of the vermin. They reminded him of the nursery \" Robin a bobbin.\" \" A butcher and a half \" would have been child's play to them ; he only wished they would go to the cupboard, and eat the veritable bit of crust that had decided, so tragically, Robin's fate. They Avould run regular steeple-chases round the place, and jump from bed to bed ; and often their little cold feet would wake a man up as they ran across his face. Then a squeak of terror, and a muttered curse, would tell of some unlucky \"warmint\" being seized, and shied with a squash against the walls, or amongst the rafters. It is a mistake to suppose that rats are naturally vicious; no creatures can be less offensive. If not irritated they become quite friendly. It is a nasty feeling to havTe them for bed com panions, but they willj do no harm. They are very destructive to property, but, with rare exceptions, they do not attack the human body. In this respect, maybe, like the sharks, they are afraid of numbers. How far this loft would have been safe for a single individual one can hardly say. Charlie, at least, would scarcely have liked to try the experiment, and he shared in the general opinion that it was best to let them have their own way. The cock-loft party was made up of an engineer, by name Edwards (he was out of his element, acting as a wharfage clerk); a Dublin University man, at one time a great gun, now under-master to a small school; an ex-trooper who had tried his hand at many things ; a post-office clerk, who, with a loud sounding name and aristocratic appearance, was"], [116, "110 VAGABOND CHAELIE. most scrupulous about the fit of his gloves and gloss of his hat, and in the habit of getting himself up as if he was in London; a capital fellow called Richards, who had been in the army, sold his com mission, and was trying how fast he could get rid of the little that was left, out of something like two thousand pounds with which he had started. He began by driving tandem, and enjoying its attendant pleasures, and ended, as the sequel will show, in a horsey manner not quite so agreeable. These, with Rice and Charlie, formed a little coterie of their own ; the rest being of a somewhat different stamp. They were a father and two sons, who had made money by road-making, and were now looking out for an investment in land near the town ; others of minor importance, of various callings, such as car penters, and masons, and general \"jacks of all trades.\" Barring Richards and a carpenter, all of them were Irish ; and Charlie very soon made himself a general favourite. The three lodgers in the front house were Rouse, the town surveyor, and a Mr. and Mrs. Ryan, who were an elderly married couple, and victims of the Encumbered Estates Act ; they had come to lay their bones in a foreign soil. It was a bitter disappointment to Charlie to find that Rice (attracted by the immense profits to be made if everything went straight) had joined the ex-trooper in the purchase of a horse and dray to take goods up to Ballarat. If they made a rapid journey to the fields, bought their goods cheap and sold well, they would realise"], [117, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 111 double Avhat they gave for them. To do this required a thorough knowledge of the Melbourne market, and of the requirements at Ballarat, and a tolerable acquaint ance with the road up and down. In fact, like all other business, to pay, it wanted a considerable amount of learning. Rice and his friend knew next to nothing, and of course based all their calculations on the profit side, by which they showed on paper an excellent scheme. The main point of interest to Charlie was, that when they returned, he should join them with a second dray, purchased with the profits of their first journey. They omitted to reckon the chances of a jibbing horse, bad roads, occasional loss of a horse for a day or two, and other drawbacks inseparable from dray or wagon travelling. They bought their horses at the Melbourne \"Tatter sail's,\" saw them take a ton weight of stuff over two half hundredweights scotched against the wheels \u2014 about as delusive a test of stanchness which the fra ternity of horse-dealers could devise. It looks in a yard a great proof of good collar work, but it is no warranty against jibbing ; the most confirmed jibber can easily be trained to do it, and yet when he gets on the road be worse than useless. For want of any thing better, it was generally considered that a horse who passed this test might fairly be warranted stanch. Any auctioneer or buyer might easily be misled, for a jibbing horse is as cunning as a buck-jumper. There are times when he will lay down to his work and pull his heart out, and you fancy he would stick at nothing. The cunning beggar will do this when the road is easy,"], [118, "112 VAGABOND CHAELIE. or perhaps a mile from his stable or halti ng-place, and you congratulate yourself on a good bargain. But just wait till you come some early morning to a bit of bad road, or swampy ground, and see where you will be. All that day, and probably half the next, you won't advance a hundred yards ; and your time will be fully occupied in loading and unloading, thrashing and swearing at this beast, who, when you have emptied your dray, will jerk it along some few yards. With all the cunning of his nature he will watch you re-load, and when all is made snug and the last rope taut, back you go into the same hole you have just come out of; or else he plunges recklessly into the nearest spot where he thinks it most likely you will have all your trouble over again. He will stand, mean while, stock-still, and no power on earth can get him to stir till everything is again deposited on the boggy and dirty ground. I firmly believe a jibbing horse takes a delight in deceiving his master ; and the plea sure he derives from all the trouble he gives compen sates, in a great measure, for the thrashing and abuse so freely showered upon him. \" Trying the patience of Job \" is the very mildest expression to use on such an occasion. Perhaps it is as well for the good man's reputation that such a trial was not put upon him. One of the horses purchased by Rice turned out just such an one as I have tried to describe. They left Melbourne with everything in first-rate order, and with a good load of flour \u2014 at that time fetching a very high price at Ballarat. They returned at the end of five weeks, their trip a com plete failure."], [119, "113 VAGABOND CHARLrE. The journey up was a succession of misfortunes, and, when the diggings were reached, others had arrived before them with loads of flour ; so that the very article out of which they thought to make so much realized less than half, instead of double what they gave for it. Besides this, from the continued off-loading occasioned by the jibbing horse, heavy rains, and bad roads, half their stock was damaged ; altogether they made a hash of the whole concern. By way of making things easier, they quarrelled on the road, and for days would hardly speak to one another. When they made their appearance at the old quar ters they were scarcely recognisable. Begrimed with dirt, their garments torn and seedy, they presented an appearance in striking contrast to the two smart hand some car drivers who had gone out a few weeks back, full of hope and good spirits. They came back miser ably chapfallen, and ready to fight even Charlie for daring to laugh at them ; for this the boy did most immoderately ; so much so indeed that Rice got quite angry with him. A good wash, clean clothes, and supper, made them both more amiable ; and they kept the cock-loft party alive that night by recounting what they had gone through. Amidst all their relation of trouble and difficulty, the one grand arch-enemy was the jibbing horse, which, from first to last, was the origin of every mischief. During Rice's absence, Charlie, by way of training, had done a little dray-driving about town. Through the interest of the post-office aristocrat he got introduced to a man in business who wanted a driver to work his dray between the wharf and the town, and who was glad 8"], [120, "114 VAGABOND CHARLIE. to get a young fellow whom he felt he could trust ; so he made no difficulty about engaging Charlie. The usual charge per load for all goods was seven shillings within a prescribed radius, and Charlie was to have the odd two shillings as his share. This, with good luck, often paid master and man handsomely. It was hard work, and very trying to his temper. The stable was two miles from his lodging ; and he had to rise early, take his breakfast and lunch with him, tied up in true carman-like style in a coloured hand kerchief. Nine o'clock was the time business commenced at the wharf. Half an hour before that, drays and con veyances of all kinds would flock thither. Charlie's first morning was rather intimidating ; he had cleaned down and fed his horse in good time, and had turned the concern out very creditably, rightly reckoning that a good-looking turn-out was half the battle. Early as he was, it was none too soon. When near the wharf he had great difficulty in taking up a position likely to attract attention, or get a chance of coming alongside any goods he might be called upon to remove. The harmless sort of rivalry that exists between :ab-drivers and bus-men at home, was here intensified and exaggerated till it reached a demoniacal race as to who should get first. It would have puzzled a Hogarth to depict the faces of these men, and the language they used to one another we may charitably hope was often unintelligible. It sounded strangely familiar, yet very harsh, to Charlie, who, had the affair been his own, would have turned tail and chucked it over. Luckily he had pluck enough not to show the white"], [121, "115 VAGABOND CHARLIE. feather, and if he could not earn much for himself, he would try and do his master justice. The gentlemanly driver he had seen on first landing came into his head, and he thought how he must have gone through a similar ordeal before reaching the ad vanced stage which he had evidently arrived at. Some fellows would drive slap against his horse, or jam his dray up in a corner, so that the boy couldn't extricate himself; and all the while they would curse him up hill and down dale for being such a soft-looking lub berly driver. Through this and much more, the lad held his own, and the first day he got six loads \u2014 a very good average number for the sharpest. This left him twelve bob in perspective to go to sleep on. The next morning he Avent to work determined not to be browbeaten by a lot of ruffians, any one of whom he was quite willing to have a row with, if the chance occurred, out of work hours. That those who help themselves usually obtain unseen help, was abundantly proved. In a few days Charlie had surmounted every difficulty, he was sought for by several landing agents ; and chosen in preference to many an older hand. Edwards proved a great help, and got him lots of work ; in fact, he soon had quite as much as he could do, and was able at times to offer some blackguard a chance, by way of recompense. Strong as the lad was, it required all the strength he possessed to load up any miscellaneous cargo that came to hand; sometimes it would be a load of planks, at another, potatoes, or some kind of soft goods. Competition was so keen that, rather than bide his time till the ware housemen pleased themselves about off-loading, the 8\u20142"], [122, "116 VAGABOND CHAELrE. drayman did all the work himself, thankful only if he could obtain leave to deposit his load anywhere with despatch. It Avas no joke' to carry in and out of the queerest ramshackle buildings (converted into stores) and up and down the shakiest of stairs and ladders, sacks of oats, and bags of flour and potatoes. All had to be done in such a hurry that there was scarcely time to eat a bit of lunch, or drink a glass of grog. There is a limit to the work of even a willing horse. At the end of three weeks, although Charlie had given great satisfaction to his employer, and had earned over three pounds a week for himself, he felt he couldn't stand the work any longer, and was forced to give it up much against his will. The next thing he tried was being porter and general servant at a large store ; his work was to remove goods from old buildings (which in his dray-driving days he had helped to fill) to a newly-built, magnificent edifice. Just at this time, very many fine specimens of archi tecture sprang up about Melbourne, and in an incredibly short period raised the wooden-built township to the dignity of one of the finest cities in the world. Here again, the boy's strength was sadly over-taxed ; he had to work alongside of a gigantic, broad-shouldered porter, who could lift and carry away with ease what Charlie could scarcely movre. Like most big men, this man was the essence of good nature, and he took a great fancy to his boy-like mate, helping him all he could ; yet, for shame's sake, the lad kept as even with him as he was able. For two days they were employed in carrying a lot of iron kegs of nails, weighing close upon a hundred-"], [123, "117 VAGABOND CHAELIE. weight each. These had to be carried along a narrow passage, then up a flight of steps, and then rolled into the street ready for the dray -loaders, who made more fuss about putting them on their carts than Charlie did about bringing them upstairs. The last of the kegs was a matter of great rejoicing, and all hands adjourned to the nearest public and liquored-up freely. Charlie was toasted all round for his share of the work, and his big mate was quite proud of him. If those nails went to the hot place suggested by these worthies, they would require a large amount of recasting to be of any further use. There was a lot more heavy lifting and carrying, but nothing so bad as the nails. One day, whilst standing at the grating of a cellar window handing up axe-handles, three shipmates came by and, with great mirth and good-humour, recognised Charlie, and were much pleased to find him employed. They were the two brothers who had dropped eight hundred pounds, and another who had been quite as reckless but more fortunate in his play. The three had held together by that mysterious link which binds the careless and indifferent, and since landing had been put to some severe shifts. At the time they accosted Charlie they looked well to-do, and were tolerably flush of money. Their last job had been sawing trusses of hay for shipment ; by this it appeared they made a good thing. They had now taken a contract for felling and cutting up timber for firewood, and, wanting a fourth man, this rencounter with Charlie seemed most opportune. Charlie, however, did not jump at their proposal,"], [124, "118 ATAGABOND CHARLIE. because he had promised Rice not to leave Melbourne before his return, and was quite expecting to join him on the road afterwards. They seemed in no hurry to begin their new work, and gave Charlie plenty of time to consider their offer, promising not to engage any one else before receiving a decided reply ; they then left him to continue his labour. The kindly-hearted mate stared not a little to see the boj' on good terms with three such swells. The conversation had not been overheard, so that it appeared to him that they might have been men of wealth ; indeed they were by social standing, far above the work they had lately engaged in. Although this meeting raised Charlie in the eyes of his fellow-workmen, it did him no good in one way. The eye of his master happened to be secretly upon him during the interview. He was a man of low breed ing, and of coarse manner ; one who by careful ma nagement had worked his way from small beginnings, had risen with the times, and become very wealthy. To such a man to have any ODe approaching a gentleman under his employ was a source of pride, delight, or an noyance \u2014 it would be hard to say which. Whatever the feeling, he manifested it by giving any one he suspected of gentility the meanest and dir tiest work he could pick out, being careful to stand over him the while, or more likely to watch from behind a corner, \" how my gentleman dirtied his fin gers or shirked his work.\" Hitherto Charlie, by keep ing regular time, and showing a general alacrity and willingness to do all he was asked, had been left com pletely under the orders of his large friend."], [125, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 119 From the day of his master's discovery that \" all [persons as well as] things are not what they seem,\" he seemed bent on proving that \" life is real, life is earnest,\" and commenced a system of petty tyranny, which soon produced a reaction in Charlie's conduct. He was first ordered to come earlier in the morning, to perform some household work not in his contract ; and little jobs were put upon him in the dinner hour. The crowning insult at last came. He was told to wait and put the shutters up in the evening ; this was too much for the lad. It is a curious fact that this order upset the boy more than any other. He had done many things quite as degrading and menial, but most of these were done out of sight of the public eye. As there are-\" more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy,\" so there are stranger fancies and ideas in the youthful mind than are ever accounted for by the older and more experienced in life. Here was a funny notion of Charlie's ; he had worked in the public streets, stood up for his rights and offered to fight for them amidst the roughest of the rough ; and he had done other things besides, that to any one else would appear much more galling than putting up shutters. Perhaps he thought this act savoured too much of the shopman and counter-jumper, and nothing of the workman; it is impossible to say. He put up the shutters with scorn and disgust plainly visible in his countenance, and audible from his lips; no doubt both were seen and heard by his snob j of a master. The next evening, by accident, one end of a shutter"], [126, "120 VAGABOND CHAELrE. went clean through a large pane of glass, and upset a valuable lamp; and the following Saturday, he was told by the paymaster that a \" quantum\" was marked against his name. The bullying ironmonger had the good grace not to charge for the broken window or lamp. Their value was quite equal to the extra work put upon Charlie, who went off chuckling with the notion that he had wound up fairty, even with his tormentor. On the principle of \"give a dog a bad name and hang him,\" it struck Charlie that he had just lost his place from the fact of his being a gentleman, and that it would be as well to enjoy some of the privileges attached to his station. If his position unfitted him for work, it was ad mirably adapted for play, and this was very much more to his taste. With the commendable caution of paying his lodging money and board a fortnight in advance, he put his savings in his pocket, and, in the absence of Rice, sought out his three friends who had unwittingly done him such mischief. Like them, he resolved to enjoy his money whilst it lasted, and when it was gone to work for more. His English clothes, bell-topper hat, and fixings, were still in first-rate order ; and it Avould have been difficult to recognise in the clean-shaved, well-dressed youngster now parading the street, the rough, un washed cub who, the day before, did the dirty work at an iron store. \" Sic transit gloria rnundi \" might appropriately be paraphrased into \" Sic transit opera mundi.\""], [127, "121 VAGABOND CHAELIE. To meet these four in the most fashionable thorough fares, at billiard-tables and smoking-saloons, or to dine with them at the best hotels, you would never have supposed they had taken their coats off, dirtied their hands, or earned a shilling by the \" sweat of their brow.\" Only one tell-tale mark a close observer might have detected, namely, the palms of their hands ; these bore unmistakable testimony that work more trying to the muscles than wielding a billiard cue had lately occupied their time. It was during this recess that Bice came back from his eventful, though luckless expedition. Like the others he had done enough work to satisfy him for a week or two, and, nothing loath, he joined their party, and a right jolly fortnight they made it. Perfectly regardless of the future, they lived from day to day as if possessors of thousands, with a happy indifference about the renewal of work which they knew must come. They cared not one jot about the acquirement of money for the money's sake; and they would much rather lead a hand-to-mouth existence ; putting up pleasantly enough with twice the hardships a more staid and plodding life would have entailed. However, good times, like good things, do not last for ever, and at the end of his fortnight, Charlie dis covered that the number of his sovereigns had again fallen into the column of units, which necessitated a return to labour. Rice still had his imaginary business to fall back upon ; this mainly consisted in getting the little fat left in his \" frying-pan out of the fire,\" before every farthing"], [128, "122 VAGABOND CHAELIE. he had was melted. Profit he ceased to think about, and he might have been more profitably employed than in wasting his time by endeavouring to get back what was lost. Every half-crown he redeemed cost him three shillings and sixpence; yet, so blind are men when they try to recover money they have lost, that he fancied he was doing a trade, and would not give it up. CHAPTER XIV. All idea of a second trip to the diggings was of course abandoned ; Charlie again reluctantly saw the chance of joining Rice slip by, and was obliged to fall back on the wood-cutting spec'. The contract entered upon by these greenhorns was, that they should remove the fallen timber, grub up stumps, and fell all dead trees in a district near town) and then make all they could by selling them for fire wood. There is hardly any manual labour pleasanter and less fatiguingly laborious than felling and cutting up timber (in the green), provided you have a fair knowledge of the various kinds of trees, difference of grain, and so forth. If you keep your tools in good order, and know how to use them, axe-work and cross-cut sawing is very remunerative. To make it pay handsomely, you want a free choice of timber near at hand, and a good steady mate to"], [129, "123 VAGABOND CHAELrE. work with ; the farther you are removed from town and its temptations the better. The reverse of these conditions surrounded Charlie and his party. Their field of operations was dan gerously near Melbourne ; and not one of them could set a saw or sharpen an axe properly. They could quote Shakespeare, eat a good dinner, and take no end of lives at pool, but wood-cutting was not in their line. The small experience of cutting through trusses of hay had given them, they thought, a fair acquaintance with the cross-cut saw ; and as to an axe, \" why, any fool could use that.\" Before dinner hour the first day they found out their mistake, and were forced to the conclusion that they must be the biggest fools in Christendom. The heap of wood cut up looked miserably small compared with the pile their imaginations had raised a few hours before. The second day they grumbled at the tools, found fault with the wood, and quarrelled amongst themselves. The third day saw a general collapse of agreement amongst ail parties concerned, and Charlie returned to his lodging worse off by a couple of sovereigns than when he started. When he returned from his unsuccessful wood splitting, much sympathy was expressed, and the landlord being about to build a stable at the back of his premises, offered Charlie the job of digging out its foundation. It was reckoned a good three days' work for one man, and the price to be paid was one guinea- As yet Charlie had done no pick and shovel work, beyond the amateur digging most boys go through in a country life."], [130, "124 VAGABOND CHARLIE. Looking at the small amount to be dug out, in pros pect it seemed to him that the guinea would be easily earned, and for an hour or two all went cheerily ; at breakfast time he talked of finishing by the second day. By noon, however, his back ached, his hands got cramped as well as blistered, and he came to the house completely beaten. It was now that he discovered what a dear old lady Mrs. Ryan was. Seeing his weary and disappointed countenance, she came forward and nursed him as her own son; she bade him lie down and rest, whilst she administered a dose of mixed herbs. This was a home-made specific which had been her sovereign remedy for all ills during many years of her life. The good old soul had been blessed with a giant frame and constitution, as had her husband likewise ; so that for half their life at least, they had suffered no ailment. Whenever the slightest derangement of mind or body took place, a dose of the all-cure elixir set them right. The draught was not particularly obnoxious to taste, and Charlie graciously submitted to all her directions. The nostrum had the effect of making his inside as uncomfortable as his outside ; nevertheless he determined to make believe that it did him good, rather than hurt the feelings or shake the faith of the kind-hearted dame. Her soft voice and soothing manner carried him back to the days of real sickness, passed under the careful nursing of his own fond mother, to whom, in some respects, he saw a resemblance in Mrs. Ryan."], [131, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 125 This treatment was all very well for the lad's mind, but by no means well for his body, for that required something more exhilarating than slops and love to work upon. The medicine sickened his stomach, but procured him a good sleep, which was perhaps the best thing. He woke up rested, but very sore, and groaned a bit at having to set to work again with those detest able tools. An hour's renewal of work brought a proper elasticity to the muscles, and by sundown he got into the knack of handling his tools, and his body became used to the labour. The next day he did pretty well, but suffered a good deal from nausea and could eat no food, still he worked on and completed two-thirds of his task. The third day was terribly hard upon him ; he was once more forced to give in, and, according to agree ment, forfeit his money. Parsons preach (and sceptics laugh at the idea) that, in all cases where a man honestly does his best and believes he is doing right, just at the pinch, some friendly hand will surely be held out. The preacher will say it is a question of faith, the scoffer that it is simply chance, or the good nature inherent in man. Whichever be right, in this case, as in many thousands more, the helping hand came. This time it was not in the shape of an old woman with a large heart and nasty dose of herbs, but in the form of the stalwart father and two stout sons, who have been named as Charlie's fellow-lodgers in the cock-loft. They had only waited for the moment when Charlie should break down (which experience told them he would do), to come to his rescue. So, whilst Charlie"], [132, "126 VAGABOND CHARLIE. sat down and paid them the wages of thanks, they went to work and finished the job ; then they took him by the hand and carried him off to the nearest public, and gave him something more palatable and stronger than mixed herbs. It was almost with shame that Charlie took his guinea from the landlord, and he would have spent it all in treating those who had so well assisted him, had they allowed him. The same generous spirit which induced them to help, prevented their accepting so much as a glass of grog. They declared themselves ready to do quite as much again, and that they should be vexed if he said any more about it. With the little cash he had in hand, this guinea just put Charlie clear through the week, paying for board and lodging, and leaving him two days to meditate on what he should do next. His reflections were none of the brightest, his whole body felt shaken to bits. The old lady took such a violent fancy to him that she lost no opportunity of commiserating him, and of drawing unpleasant com parisons as to what he was and what he might have been. She insinuated that he ought to be still under the guidance of his mother's apron-strings, and, in the absence of the real one, would have assumed this guidance herself. The pang that smote her most keenly was an open declaration, forced from Charlie, that he did not believe in her medicine, and that he had derived infinitely more benefit and comfort from the pick-me-ups adminstered by others. This gave her an excellent opportunity of launching"], [133, "127 VAGABOND CHARLIE. out on the evils of drink, as she called it, and of all alcoholic liquids. She alleged that pure water, tea, and non-intoxicat ing liquors were the only things man ought to drink when in health ; and, when sick, her own infallible concoction, or some other like it. She took her ground upon the assertion that these were the natural pro ducts of the earth, and that they were without any adulteration by man. Whereupon Charlie would admit that so far as she went she was right, but that she stopped short of the whole truth, which was simply this. The same argument which she applied to non intoxicating fluids answered equally well to alcohol and all fermented wines and spirits, for these last were also natural productions of the earth given for the use of man, and were not necessarily, or very often half so much, adulterated as the beverages she recommended and of whose purity she vaunted. Mrs. Ryan, like thousands more, looked upon the mountain of drunkeness as if raised only by the manu facture of brandy and gin ; Avhereas, although these helped toproduce the effect, the cause laychiefly inmen's hearts and passions. Intoxicating drinks need not produce drunkenness, nor need a man fear to swallow any good, wholesome liquor any more than he need be afraid to partake of any other good thing. A man can make himself quite as much a beast if he eats too much of any delicacy, or if he gives unbridled sway to any other appetite he may possess. It is true that drunkenness is a fearful curse to its victim, and very revolting to all around ; but is"], [134, "128 VAGABOND CHARLrE. it much more so than gambling, dishonesty, obscenity, and bad language, together with a thousand and one other evils about us ? These last-named may not present such a visible rock of obstruction to those who travel along the high -way of life ; but are they not equally dangerous and destructive ? This kind of argument rather staggered the self adopted mother, and she mentally gave her pet up for lost. Like most arguments, when both are agreed to convince, and not to be convinced, nothing much came of it, except that their differences of opinion were made greater by comparison. There was a much more practical lesson in front of Charlie just now, and that was how to find the money for his next week's living. Mrs. Ryan's lectures and his own home-sick reflections led him to do what many older ones may have done in times of depression, namely, to examine all their little treasures, such as old letters, keepsakes, and valuables. He was rummaging in his box, with tears in his eyes, fondly looking over the few last presents from his mother ; amongst these was a purse : it was sup posed to come from his brother, that brother whom he idolised so much, and for whose presence he would have given almost his right hand. In one of the pockets of this purse he found carefully screwed up in paper, something hard. Opening this, out rolled one pound ten\u2014 a most providential find in a moment of great despondency ! Charlie had no conception at what time, if ever, he had put this money by, and was lost in conjecture how it got there. The box and its contents, a suit of clothes, a tall"], [135, "129 VAGABOND CHAELIE. hat, and his invaluable nothings, had been a constant source of trouble : paying half-a-crown a week for storage had been a heavy tax, and he was often on the point of selling the lot. The very thing so much despised now yielded him enough for his immediate wants, and afforded him another week's respite. At tea-time that evening, Richard said that men were wanted to take the traffic at various points leading out of Melbourne, with a view to discovering the most desirable situations for bridges, toll-gates, and other municipal arrangements. Richards had got a station, and thought he could get one for Charlie. Upon the introduction of Richards, a post was assigned to Charlie half-way between Melbourne and Sandrige. He was to be at his post from sunrise to sunset for seven days, including Sunday; his duties were to note down all that passed \u2014 every living soul and beast and all vehicles, with a description of them (whether four wheeled or two), mounted men, and foot-passengers. The difference between souls and beasts was some times indistinguishable, and Charlie felt bound to confess that Mrs. Ryan had beaten him in her lecture on temperance. It was monotonous work, required strict attention, and, during the busiest time of day, wanted a quick eye and ready pencil. Here again Charlie's friends stood him in good stead. Constantly some one would stroll down, take his book, and give him a rest. He never took more than his breakfast with him ; there was always a volunteer ready to bring his dinner, and, during the week, he was never forgotten. The man who came oftenest was the one who tippled most, and who consumed 9"], [136, "130 VAGABOND CHAELIE. large quantities in brandy and water. This Charlie put down as one in favour of himself and against the old woman. On the Monday morning he went to the Town office with his report, signed a declaration that his statement was correct, and pocketed a cheque for seven guineas ; this was by far the easiest-earned money he had yet handled. Often afterwards he wished he could get another job like it; but such golden lollipops don't often fall into people's mouths, even should they go about with them wide open. Amongst Charlie's letters of introduction was one to a cousin, whose whereabouts he had not yet dis covered. Richards, however, had noticed the name on an office door, and directing him to the house he there found his relation. His cousin was glad to see him, and was much interested in the account of his adventures hitherto. He questioned him as to his ability in the writing line, and said he could give him a berth of three hundred a year if he was a good penman and fair accountant. Charlie forthwith purchased some copy-books, and devoted three days to the practice of writing a copper plate hand. It was great fun to hear the chaff that went round in the evening over his spider-like efforts to attain proficiency. Osmond came to the front and helped him, but all to no purpose. When his copy-books were full, he took them to his cousin, who commended him for his perseverance, but declined any offer in the shape of desk work, and"], [137, "131 VAGABOND CHAELIE. advised him to try something else. Another effort, and another disappointment. This cousin was an old colonist, and had made and lost two fortunes ; while sheep-farming at one time his flock was so numerous and valueless, that he boiled down sheep by the thousand for the sake of the talloAv. Just as he had ruined himself at this, the diggings broke out, and sheep, which he had boiled down for half-a-crown a head, rose to the value of twenty-five shillings. He had kept a store on the diggings and had made something by that ; now he was started as land agent and surveyor, and was making a very handsome income. The keep of his horse alone cost him three hundred per annum, but he hoped, in a few years, to realise sufficient to retire upon. Charlie left his kind cousin, vexed at his own failure, yet quite sure that here was a \" haven of rest\" when needed ; but he was determined not to seek it, so long as he could weather the storms of necessity. We must now turn to the other members of the household, from whom Charlie had experienced such kindness. Rouse, the town surveyor, had obtained a capital appointment in the Port Fairy district; and had done so well that he found an opening for Edwards, who shortly joined him. The Ryans opened a board and lodging-house at St. Kilda; it was of a superior description, but could scarcely be called a private hotel. Their late landlord, like a true compatriot, consented to give up his best lodgers to start them, and promised to recommend them to all who wanted a quiet and refined home. 9\u20142"], [138, "132 VAGABOND CHAELffi. The post-office clerk stuck steadily to his work, his gloves, and his hat ; he was a constant source of amusement, but being a good-natured, easy-going fellow, seemed rather proud than otherwise of this distinction. Osmond, the Dublin coach, persevered in his up hill work of brains versus money, interest, and posi tion; and spent his daytime inculcating the prin ciple of \"piety and sea-bathing\" upon the hard heads and harder hearts of a spirited lot of urchins, the offspring of fathers and mothers whose prin cipal title to any consideration was their money. Of this they had abundance, and with it they thought to make their sons and daughters models of society. For want of means, Osmond was compelled to take an under-mastership beneath a man he despised, one who in point of manners, education, and ability was sadly deficient. Possessed of ample means, consider able property, and a commodious dwelling-house, the pedagogue hit upon this scheme of adding to his in come. So great was the demand for education in ad vance of the supply, that his school was crowded and soon became a monetary success. At evening time Osmond relieved his oppressed mind by giving the most ludicrous description of the master, the boys, and the school. His heart seemed set upon starting a rival establish ment. Both boys and parents discovered the mockery of tuition carried on previously to his arrival, and many undertook to support him, if he would get up a school of his own. Osmond was no vain boaster, or babbler, but was"], [139, "133 VAGABOND CHAELIE. raally a man of talent, discrimination, and learning ; he had also a pleasing person, and a charming diver sity of conversation, which never failed to enlist the attention of all who heard him. In this little lodging house world every man's business was as much his neighbours' as his own. The least concerned would sit round and discuss the_prosand cons of any intended movement, or fresh start. Osmond's future became the favourite topic of all in the house ; he was so emi nently above the rest in culture that they felt how irksome must be his daily task. Hardly a day passed but some one or other would offer to advance a sum to help him ; and if his pride would have allowed it, a general subscription would have started him at once. As it was, he worked steadily on, and eventually attained his wishes by starting and upholding a new school to the entire collapse of the other ; in eighteen months he had four collegiate masters under him, with a corresponding number of boys. His motto of \" Piety and sea-bathing\" remained a constant joke with those who had known him in his humbler days, for he always maintained it was the combination of these two which had gained him success. As his share of assistance, Charlie devoted a week entirely to Osmond. He helped him to fit up and furnish his residence, and distributed prospectuses of the establishment about the neighbourhood. It was great fun calling upon the best houses, and observing the great difference of outside appearance, compared with the manners aud English of the owners. Many, surrounded by all that wealth could produce, were totally unable to assume the habits they affected"], [140, "134 VAGABOND CHAELIE. Charlie was treated most grandly, and more than one imagined that he was the principal, much to the amusement of Osmond, to whom he reported each day's proceedings. At the end of a week these two friends separated \u2014 Osmond to begin his new work with six boys, and to start (as before shown) on the high-road to prosperity; Charlie to return to his Melbourne house, not much benefited in pocket but vastly improved in mind by his short stay with Osmond and his wife. The latter had been living with her brother, and before this was quite unknown to him. Here in fact lay the secret of Osmond's emigration. He had been fascinated by the appearance and manners of a charming little woman in every way suited to him, except that in social position she was not quite on a par with him and his univer sity connections. Rather than bring a slight on the woman of his choice, he gave up a prosperous career at home, and ventured to Australia where he met his reward. CHAPTER XV. In consequence of these changes, when Charlie re turned to his old quarters the tone of the place was much changed, so he and Rice moved off to the Ryans' at St. Kilda. For the same weekly payment they lived in com parative luxury; there were only four beds in one room, and they had two washstands. Instead of a"], [141, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 135 miserable apology for washing each morning, they could go through some semblance of a complete toilet, and appear at the breakfast-table more polished in face as well as in manner. The Ryans were true gentlefolks, neither aristocrats nor parvenus. They belonged to that class of yeomanry which inherits all the nobilitj', good feeling, and sim plicity of the first, without any of its haughty pride, and they had not one jot of the snobbishness of the second. A select choice of lodgers, a cleanly establish ment, good food, and a pleasant host and hostess, created an agreeable change, very much appreciated by those who had moved from Melbourne. Osmond's brother, Frank, had lately come down from Ballarat with an elaborate account of the money to be made by selling lemonade ; and he tried to get twenty pounds from his brother to invest in this line. Frank had a portion of the other's talent, which exhibited itself in conversation. Indeed, for pleasantry, apt repartee, and diversity of subject, he would sur pass the elder one ; but, when deeply probed, he was not anything like so good a scholar. Failing to persuade his brother to advance what he could ill spare, Frank fell back upon Rice, who still supported himself, and was able to lay his hand upon money when required. It was soon arranged for Frank and Rice to go to Ballarat, and there to start a lemonade shop, taking Charlie with them as friend, companion, and servant. Rice found the money, Frank bought the materials ; his experience and introductions at Ballarat were reckoned equivalent to Rice's money. The profits were"], [142, "136 VAGABOND CHAELIE. to be equally divided between the two : Charlie was to have all his expenses paid, but to receive no wages until the business could afford it. Thirty pounds worth of stock was purchased and handed over to a reliable dray-driver, a friend of Frank's, who promised to deliver them safely and quickly, and as a token of friendship charged Rice an additional amount for his introduction. Frank, of course, was most sanguine in his anticipa tions, and talked as if he had at last found the philo sopher's stone, whilst Rice listened and wondered if he was to be the philosopher. He had strange forebodings and misgivings that his thirty pounds would quickly follow the rest of his ill advised speculations ! Charlie didn't care much either way; all he had to do was to reach Ballarat, and something was sure to turn up if the fizz-shop failed. A start of three days was allowed for the goods; then with a hearty good-bye from the Ryans, and best wishes from many others, they left St. Kilda, took a steamboat to Geelong, and commenced their tramp to Ballarat. Frank, who had assumed the direction of affairs, said they would reach the field the second day, the distance being about sixty miles. Rice and Charlie both carried swags, i.e., blankets, and sundries. Frank spurned the idea of carrying anything, and managed capitally without ; he was one of those mysterious characters who never have money, yet always dress well, eat good dinners, and lead a very well-to-do kind of life. They slept at Geelong that night, rose early, and"], [143, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 137 made a good start before breakfast. The early walk was pleasant enough, and after an hour's rest they renewed their journey. The fatigue of walking did not tell upon any of them till two p.m., when they came to a wayside eating-house and dined. Towards evening, Charlie began to wince under his weight of blankets, and nearly knocked up. The halting-place for the night was a half-way house. In all new countries at unknown distances there is a nominal half-way house ; this was no exception to the rule, it might, or might not, be half-way to anywhere. It was said to be twenty-seven miles to Geelong ; according to Charlie's calculation it was nearer thirty five. The last ten miles seemed interminable, and very cheering was the sight of a habitation to the weary travellers. The idea of comfort and rest turned out to be more imaginary than real. \" What's in a name ?\" Very often a vast amount of humbug, and occasionally a tremendous perversion of truth. Here was a place called \"The Queen's Hotel,\" with \"accom modation for horse and man,\" written in large letters on a rough board, to attract the eye of passers-by. The horse Avas put first in the advertisement, and it may be hoped he came first in the accommodation. Charlie expected that directly he arrived he would get some supper and go to bed ; this was his idea of \" accommodation for man.\" Not a bit of it. He must wait till it suited other people as well as himself. The house, originally a squatter's residence, was a low wooden building with two good-sized rooms in the centre, and two little side-rooms, a kitchen, stabling, and stockyard at the back."], [144, "138 VAGABOND CHAELIE. When the rush to Ballarat took place, these premises assumed the high-sounding title of \" Queen's Hotel.\" A greater imposition it would be hard to find. Rice and Charlie, footsore and tired, innocently asked when they could have some food, and were roughly told that supper would not be ready for more than an hour ; they then asked for a place in which to lie down, and this request was met with the rude reply that they \" must wait till bed-time.\" Any chance of getting a wash was out of the ques tion, unless they walked three hundred yards or more to a neighbouring creek. They were far too tired for that, and so threw themselves down in the verandah, aud waited patiently for the announcement of supper, being too weary even to complain. Frank discovered a friend in some person of distinc tion, who held possession of the one decent apartment, and with this friend he spent the night \u2014 probably with some degree of comfort. His two chums, mean while, were made the butt of some thirty genuine diggers, and general loafers ; these filled up the interim before supper by smoking and drinking, and using the strongest and most offensive language it had yet been Charlie's fate to listen to. The choicest pieces of dialect were showered on Rice and himself for blocking up the gangway, and for being such chicken-hearted new chums as to break down under only a twenty-seven mile walk. After enduring a good two hours of this, at last supper was ready, and a rush was made to the largest of the two rooms ; this was capable of holding twenty well, but thirty in it made a decided crush."], [145, "139 VAGABOND CHAELIE. At the door of this supper-room stood a gigantic woman with arms and hands, \" large, sinewy, mus cular, and brawny,\" enough to bid defiance to the stoutest village blacksmith, poet ever sung of. This female was no poem, but an enormous mass of prose. From her mouth came forth a voice like the growl of a wild beast, demanding five shillings from each one as he passed the threshold. With such a sentinel there was little chance of any one getting his food without payment. Charlie had just learnt how these men could drink and talk, and now, to see them eat was, to use a Yankee expression, \" a caution to snakes.\" On two tables were placed rows of pannikins, tin plates, steel forks and knives, several huge dishes of beef steaks, mutton-chops, and fry, and large home-made loaves. Charlie had lived at home near some kennels, and had often seen the hounds feeding, and had remarked the voracious way in which they dived their heads amongst the boiled rice and stuff, to get at the tit-bits of meat. The scene before him suggested the idea of human hounds ; amongst such a set of roughs there was little formality or politeness. Once past those talons that had closed upon thirty crown pieces as if they were so many threepenny-bits, each man was at liberty to help himself as best he might. Amidst such a scramble, Rice and Charlie stood a poor chance ; their whole nature revolted at such a spectacle, and they felt as if they would gladly give another five shillings to get out of this den, and yet they were loath to be done out of money and food to gether. Strange to say, amongst the roughest and"], [146, "140 VAGABOND CHAELIE. most blackguard set of men, there lurks often many grains of good-nature, and noAvhere is this fact better proved than in scenes like the above described. Whilst Charlie and Rice stood irresolute, and un decided what course to pursue, a space was cleared iu the centre of the best table, and room made for them to sit down. The very men whose tongues half an hour before had, poetically speaking, wafted them over hill and dale, and consigned their souls to the direst and hottest places, now vied with one another in waiting upon and supplying them with the choicest morsels on the table. These hard-handed, thick headed, yet withal, in some respects, warm-hearted fellows, thoroughly understood the position of the new chums. Several became quite pathetic over the boy like appearance of Charlie, who, if he had accepted, or could have swallowed half the food (to say nothing of the liquor) pressed upon him must inevitably have succumbed and disappeared under the table ; as it was, \" crowded \" is no name for the state in which he arose from this \" too solid banquet.\" Many books and people speak of the enormous amount of tea drank in Australia. For form's sake, as if to keep up the delusion, at one end of the room there was an enormous kettle of tea, to which no one resorted. Brandy and water, or, more correctly, water and brandy, was the beverage drank at this supper. There seemed as little chance of a bed after supper as before, and again the time of expectancy was employed in drinking, smoking, and talking. To Charlie it was a perfect riddle how these fellows managed. He kept thinking how \" Charles I. walked and talked half"], [147, "141 VAGABOND CHAELIE. an hour after his head was cut off,\" and said to himself : \" These men walk and talk hours after any ordinary mortal could stand upright.\" Shout after shout, i.e., nobbier after nobbier, went round, and yet no one be came incapable. It was midnight before the welcome tidings of bed came. By this time many had chosen a neighbouring gum-tree, or a convenient part of the stockyard for their resting-place, which left fifteen who wanted sleeping accommodation. When all was ready the same feminine giant stood at the same door as before, and reduced her demand to half-a-crown, to be paid on entry. No more pre paration had been made than clearing the room of every article, except the tables and benches, which were quickly secured by the knowing ones ; the rest were left to choose a spot for themselves ; all had their own blankets, bedding not being supplied. \" The Queen's Hotel \" had done its part by supply ing the room, which, at two shillings and sixpence per head, must have left a nice little profit over and above that already made by the supper. Rice and Charlie got into one corner, rolled them selves up, and soon slept well, although they were occasionally disturbed by some one falling over them, or striking a match in their faces. Some of these \" hardy Norsemen \" kept the game going far into the morning, recounting to one another the \" piles \" and \" sells \" that had been their lot. A general stir commenced about six o'clock, as it was necessary to clear out and make room for breakfast preparations. When Charlie asked where he could wash, a lump of soap and a dingy-looking towel were"], [148, "142 VAGABOND CHARLIE. flung at him b}' the elephantine female, and he was bid go and cleanse himself at the creek. Just before breakfast, Frank, prim and smiling, came out and inquired how they had fared. He, by his own account, had been in clover, and had shared, with his aristocratic acquaintance, the best the house could afford. Breakfast was but badly attended, and neither Charlie nor Rice had much stomach for the warmed-up remnants of the last night's viands. Frank, on the contrary, eat like a hunter, which gave rise to the suspicion that his boasted luxuriance of the previous evening had been more refined than substantial. As they crossed the creek wherein they had bathed they looked back upon the \" Queen's Hotel\" with no feeling of regret at leaving behind such an extor tionate abode. Frank's good-humoured chaff and fre quent sallies kept them in good spirits for some miles, until Charlie became too tired to keep pace with his more lively companions. Frank was ready enough with his joke, but never once offered to relieve him of his swag. He descanted largely upon the merits of a certain sly grog tent, which was kept by a Captain Verdant, said to be a retired officer from the British army. It has been remarked that \" the flower of Eng land's youth\" enter the two services of the army and navy. These flowers must partake of the nature of thorns and thistles if half the dead leaves in the shape of retired captains and majors, ever really earned their title from the hands of our most gracious Queen. Of course Frank was well-known to Verdant, and he promised them better refreshment there than they had"], [149, "143 VAGABOND CHAELIE. had at the \" Queen's.\" Stimulated by this hope, Charlie pressed on, and was at length cheered by the sight of a white roof peeping out from beneath the shelter of a group of trees, which stood back from the road. To Frank's evident mortification, and to the others' dis appointment, the military proprietor of this booth was absent. His substitute knew nothing of Frank, and stoutly denied all knowledge of possessing any beverage stronger than tea, coffee, and lemonade. None of these restored vigour to Charlie, or refreshed Rice, who began to look upon Frank as a bit of a humbug. It was the dry season, and they had long distances to travel without water. Just when most tired and thirsty, they came to a glorious spot, from the middle of which issued forth a clear, cool stream. Only those who have experienced the weary fatigue of foot travelling, and who have felt the parched lip and fevered broAv of thirst, can recognise to its full extent the \" perfect wisdom\" in those few words, \" a man need only to wash his feet.\" Both Charlie and Rice felt this forcibly, as they sat with their feet immersed in this refreshing water. A couple of hours' rest enabled them to proceed gaily till five o'clock, when they reached a small township four miles from Bal larat. The sight of real houses, and the promise of solid com fort, induced Charlie to decide on remaining for the night at an hotel very superior to the \" Queen's,\" though it claimed a much more modest title. Frank and Rice refreshed themselves at the bar, and proceeded, after giving Charlie a sovereign and pro mising to be on the look-out for him early next day."], [150, "144 VAGABOND CHAELIE. Left alone, the full sense of weariness and loneliness came upon the lad with great force. The landlady was very kind, and gave him some tea ; but he was told that he could not go to bed till the proper time, so he strolled out and sat under a gum-tree reading \" Tupper's Proverbial Philosophy.\" This book had so far accompanied him in all his journeys, and was his constant companion. At supper, only two men besides himself appeared ; and at bed-time, which came at last, he had a most comfortable room, clean sheets, and a real bed to recline upon, for less money than at the half-way house. At this hotel, at any rate, there was proper \" accommodation for man.\" CHAPTER XVI. Next morning Charlie awoke refreshed and strength ened, and approaching the diggings by the main road, he was met by Rice, who had only gone on the night before to please Frank, and was not a little vexed at leaving Charlie behind. Frank's store-keeping friend was very hospitable, and promised to look well after the goods when they arrived, which they had not yet done. It was quite uncertain when their stock-in-trade would be available, so, rather than be idle, Frank said he would look up a friend in the Eureka fields, and remain there till Rice wanted him."], [151, "145 VAGABOND CHAELIE. Meanwhile Rice and Charlie said they would try their hand at the shallow diggings in Sailor's Gully. The storekeeper foundtkeni tools, and introduced them to an old digger ; this man made a capital living by puddling in old diggings, washing refuse stuff and fossicking. It was exciting work to hear the old hand relate the odd finds he came across and which others had missed. One time when he was fossicking an old hole, he brought out a capful of dirt, which he carried home to his tent, and from which he washed out three ounces of gold. He returned to the spot next morning, and came upon a pocket of gold containing ten ounces. Two strokes of the pick would have yielded this treasure to the original digger of the hole had he not left it. How many thousands of prizes are in like manner lost, when almost within the grasp of the hand that has done all the work. Perhaps the worker has lacked the necessary patience, and the reward has been seized by another who has done little or nothing to win it. Rice and Charlie found very little gold, but they picked up a vast amount of auriferous information from their mate. They procured excellent lodging in a large canvas built residence, with ten beds made up in one division, and a well-furnished table in the other. The charge was moderate, being thirty shillings a week. They did not, under the auspices of their mate, kill them selves at work ; and, had they both been well in funds, their life might have been pleasant enough; but poor Rice got dreadfully irritable. He was annoyed with Frank for making off, and yet he knew it was 10"], [152, "146 VAGABOND CHARLIE. the kindest thing to do. Besides he could ill-afford to keep Charlie, who also felt that he was somewhat of a burden. Ah ! money, money ! how many hearts hast thou before and since estranged ! It is easy for a friend out of his abundance to give little or much, but how rare is the friendship that cheerfully stands the test of sharing the last few pounds with another who has nothing ! There was no open breach between these two, but it was evident that Rice was anxious to start his business, and Charlie felt himself an unwilling hanger-on, and recipient of his bounty. The goods arrived at last, and Frank was sent for, and for a day or two all three busied themselves in pitching their tent, and in arranging the shop. When all was done the place wore a thoroughly business-like appearance. The lemonade was made, duly tasted, and pronounced first rate. Charlie was posted behind the counter ; he had a big flag over his head with \" Lemonade \" in large letters upon it ; and another huge piece of bunting informed the public at large, that the said lemonade could be had for twopence a glass. The bait did not take ; very few came to buy. The first day Charlie sold two glasses, and the second day five. Obviously, any profit attached to the sale of seven glasses at twopence each, would be miserably small when divided into three, and the lemonade shop at this rate could scarcely be called a \" business.\" Frank's excuse for the failure was that so many hawkers went about, and visited the diggers at their"], [153, "147 VAGABOND CHARLrE. work with barrels of lemonade on their backs, that the standing shops had no chance. It was a pity for Rice's sake that he did not find this out before he came all the way to Melbourne, and persuaded him to try the spec. Failure, rapid and certain, stared them in the face, so Frank went off to his friend at Eureka, and left Rice and Charlie to fight it out alone. Rice, with all his noble qualities, was naturally in dolent, and Charlie never did more work than he could help ; so they shut up shop, and took a day's holiday, and went to see a prize fight for twenty-five pounds a side, which by the way was a miserable affair. The winner got excessively bumptious after he had thrashed his opponent, and challenged any one present to fight for the same amount. Charlie was ready in a moment to jump into the ring. He thought by a good coup to get a little capital, and felt certain he could knock the fellow into a cocked-hat in no time. Unfortunately, Rice would not hear of such a thing, and threatened to cut him entirely if he did anything so disreputable as to turn prize-fighter. Neither of them had the money to stake, and Charlie was forced to keep quiet. He afterwards talked the matter over with the store keeper, and found he was much of Rice's opinion, namely, that prize-fighting was not exactly the wisest commencement for a youth, even if he won the battle. The next day, in their wanderings, they met an American who had known Rice in Melbourne. He strongly advised them to get a claim in the Gravel-pit lead, a long way from their present quarters. The Gravel-pit lead promised to be one of the richest 10\u20142"], [154, "148 VAGABOND CHARLIE. yet opened, and amongst the first rush, Rice and the American marked out adjoining claims, and shepherded them till such time as they could form a party to work them properly. The rule was this : any one could mark out a claim anywhere he liked upon unoccupied ground, and then he was bound to work it once in tAventy-four hours. If left for this space of time the claim was forfeited, and became the property of the first man who \"jumped it.\" To sink a hole three hundred feet deep (as many of them were), it required a party of eight or at least six, and, as it took from three to four months to go down, a considerable amount of money was wanted. Often a poor man Avould get the chance of a likely spot on a good lead, and, if the surrounding claims paid, his became of great value, although he may pos sibly have only sunk about six feet, and amused himself by the shepherding process. One shovelful of stuff heaved out in a day, was quite sufficient to establish his right to the property for the next twenty-four hours. Hence arose the expression of \" shepherding.\" The Australian shepherd has the credit of being the laziest fellow in existence. A rather good story to illustrate this is told of a squatter, who once tried to prove if the assertion was correct. He came one sultry day upon three shepherds basking in the sun, and riding up to them, said : \" Look here, my men, I will give half-a-crown to the man who tells me the shortest cut to Doctor Green's.\" The first man raised his right hand only, and pointed to the north. The second lifted his leg, and said :"], [155, "149 VAGABOND CHARLIE. \" Keep the sun on your right shoulder, and start in this direction and you will get there all right.\" The third said : \" Jump off your horse, master, put the half-crown in my pocket, and then I will think about it.\" To shepherd a hole requires very little more labour than raising a hand or a leg half-a-dozen times a day, or putting a little dirt in your pocket. Rice performed this heavy task one day, and left Charlie in charge of the re-opened lemonade shop. It was settled that they should take turn and turn about, one day digging, one day shop-keeping. The first day Rice arranged to come back for his dinner, so, in the absence of business, Charlie, who sold four glasses and drank six, set to work to make a damper. He might have bought a very good loaf of baker's bread, but one of the requisites insisted upon by Frank was a bag of flour ; so he thought it only right to use this for economy's sake. All he knew was, that damper meant flour and water, with or without soda, mixed and baked. He had been told it was a mistake to disturb the damper when once covered over, so he made a pretty shaped loaf, covered it with fire and then left it. Poor Charlie's first effort at cooking would have hardly gained a prize at Professor Buckmaster's school of cookery. The damper came out, as a specimen of hardbake or Egyptian potter}\" a decided success, but as an article for food perfectly useless. The chops got fly-blown in the pan, and were uneatable. Rice was savage, and abused Charlie for his neglect and waste of good food. Charlie blackguarded the country and everything in it, and told Rice to cook his"], [156, "150 VAGABOND CHAELIE. own dinner, and see what sort of fist he Avould make at it. They both of them bitterly repented coming up to Ballarat. One day at the shop was a settler for Rice. When Charlie returned from his bout of shep herding, he had made no effort at all to get any dinner ; so they went to their lodging-tent, and paid for one there. In the evening it transpired that Rice had heard of a dray going down at daylight to Geelong, and by this he determined to depart, leaving Charlie in charge of his goods, with instructions to sell off everything, and to continue the digging. Left alone by the dim light of a slush camp, made with a bit of string, stuck in the centre of a pannikin of fat, he perused his Tupper, and turned to the words : \" Choose thy friend discreetly.\" \" Precious as were the stores of his friend's mind,\" he did not \"find them above gold,\" and he began to fear he had made a mistake. Their parting was not the \" good wine at last\" which he read about. For several days, unaided, he divided his time in keeping shop and shepherding. Neither jobs were to his mind, and he felt like a bear with a sore back ; he only wanted a chance both to growl and bite. A good one came. Returning from his work, whilst talking to a man in the road, and not dreaming of being taken up, he heard a sudden rush, and a cry of \"Joey! Joey!\" and, \"Look out for your licenses.\" Before he could bolt, two troopers cleverly secured him, and demanded his license. This of course he had not, and he Avas marched off to the Commissioner's tent to be either fined or imprisoned."], [157, "151 VAGABOND CHAELIE. The operation of being handcuffed to a trooper's stirrup-iron is by no means cheering ; and when Charlie sat down on a hard bench in the guard-tent, awaiting his turn of trial, his mind was not in a very amiable mood. Whilst he was chewing the cud of disappointment, a swaggering sergeant came up and chucked him under the chin, and said, \" What a pretty boy you are !\" This was beyond endurance. \" I'll boy you !\" said Charlie, and he sprang at him like a tiger, and delivered a blow like the kick of a horse, Avhich sent the impertinent sergeant flying out of the tent, and half-way down the incline on which it was situated. He staggered up with both hands to his face, blubber ing like a baby, and feeling so ashamed that he sneaked behind the tent, and was heard of no more. Charlie, his wrath somewhat appeased, coolly re sumed his seat. The two sentries consulted what should be done. Feeling very sure that the sergeant would gladly hold his tongue, and bring no charge against them, they exacted a promise from Charlie not to escape, and pretended to have seen nothing. Clearly they hated the sergeant, and knew he richly deserved his punishment. When called before the Commissioner and asked to explain why he had no license, he told the \" whole truth, and nothing but the truth \" \u2014 except that he omitted his attack on the sergeant. The Commissioner took a lenient view of the case, read him a homily against law- breaking generally, and non-license paying particularly, and let him go. After such generous treatment, Charlie, in honour bound,"], [158, "152 VAGABOND CHAELIE. resigned his pick and shovel, and let who might \"jump his claim.\" He quite agreed with the Commissioner that actual diggers should pay a license, but he could not apply the argument to store-keeping and other employ ments. Satisfied that no. good could come of the lemonade business, he sent a message to Frank, and begged him to come over and relieve him of further responsibility. Frank readily responded and brought his Eureka friend, Bowden, with him. Bowden had two large stores, and was about starting a third which Frank was to manage. They bought up the whole of Rice's stock for thirty six pounds, which sum Charlie was very glad to handle, and to deposit with the storekeeper who had advanced to Rice, before he left, nearly the whole amount. However, this was not so bad ; whatever Frank's dodge was, he made Bowden pay for what he bought. They left Charlie, saying the things should be fetched the following day, but never added a word about himself. Poor boy! he did think it hard of Frank. He had a good cry when their backs were turned, and he read from Tupper : \" If thou see thy friend to be selfish, thou canst not be sure of his honesty.\" Frank was clearly selfish. Was he honest ? This was a question Charlie asked himself more than once. It was very evident he had \" sought his own weal '' and \" wronged the reliance of Rice.\" Bitter indeed were Charlie's thoughts that night, as"], [159, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 153 he sat on the bag of flour, surrounded with the luckless jars of soda, acids, essences of lemon, and empty tumblers. For a week he had been without regular food, and had had precious little liquor ; he had chiefly subsisted on bread and lemonade. His efforts at cooking were so futile, that he would rather go without than eat the messes his want of knowledge produced. Robinson Crusoe on his desolate rock could scarce have felt more miserable than did Charlie that night, as he rolled himself up to sleep. His waking thoughts were full of cruel self-reproach, and earnest longing for the home he had foolishly left. How different the real Ballarat to the one he had dreamt of and read about at home ! The shining nuggets looked no longer his to grasp. The life was such, that if what he had seen of it was the necessary price of gold, rather than share it he heartily wished he might remain a pauper all his life. Like a soldier on the eve of battle, his dreams were of home, and all he held most dear. He seemed to see the peaceful firelight, the fond father and mother, his happy brothers, and the table ready spread to greet his return ; all these things and many more were there before him with such intense vividness, that it was moments after waking before he could realise that he was not at home, Bowden sent a cart next morning for the goods, and, just as Charlie had given up everything and was won dering what he should do next, Frank appeared and asked him how much money he possessed. This was"], [160, "154 VAGABOND CHAELIE. not difficult to reckon \u2014 a threepenny-bit being the sum total of his balance. Frank said he had better join him, and help to build a new store ; so Charlie went along with the goods. Bowden was making a lot of money ; his two stores paid well, and he hoped much would be done with a third. The one Charlie went to was situated on the Eureka flat ; it was not far from the new one, which was in course of erection. His chief work here was to wait upon the manager of the old store, who had been bitten by a centipede, and who had nearly lost his arm, which had swollen as big as a man's thigh. It took six weeks to get right. Directly the new store was built, Frank was installed as manager and Charlie was taken on as assistant. It would be more properly put the other way \u2014 Charlie manager, and Frank assistant. One got all the pay, and the other did the work. It was soon apparent that Bowden's storekeeping was only another name for sly grog-selling. The prin cipal business was done in porter and brandy. If Rice had brought up beer and porter instead of lemonade, he would have made a pot of money. Charlie's conscience was a little troubled at times as to whether it was exactly right to aid and abet in this wholesale disregard of law. However, as he was get ting no profit himself, and was only earning his food, and was not likely to remain long, he reconciled him self to circumstances. Frank's behaviour was more mysterious than ever. He slept on the premises about once a week, and occasionally, for an hour in the day, took charge whilst"], [161, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 155 Charlie went for wood aud water. But most days he was absent, and Charlie had the place to himself. Bowden came each Monday morning to take away money, and to give general directions. Charlie's principal diet in this shop consisted of raw ham and pickles, varied with jam and biscuit. Frank's continued absence gave him very little opportunity of looking after the necessaries of life. Wood and water were two things for which he trusted very much to Providence. When quite run out of water, he would slip out in the very early morning for a couple of buckets. Fire he did not much care about ; there was plenty of porter to be had, so he could easily dispense with tea or coffee. Frank was of great use in one way ; he always ob tained early and correct information about the move ments of the police, and then he would either come, or send word, that Charlie must be on the look-out for the gentlemen in blue. If they came by day they would find soap and cheese, starch and blue, artistically arranged upon the counter; Charlie would be in nocently sitting behind, and looking as if he had never known of such a thing as sly grog-selling. The bobbies would ask a few questions, and tell some interesting story about some fellow they had caught napping, and how he was pulled up and fined, and all his goods forfeited. Meanwhile the very counter they leant upon concealed a large quantity of contraband liquid. One huge butt of porter bothered Charlie, he did not know how to hide it, so he gave up the attempt and chalked \" vinegar \" upon it. None of"], [162, "156 VAGABOND CHAELIE. the police liked vinegar, and the ruse passed un detected. At night-time matters were arranged in a far more hospitable manner. The little back tent was provided with a comfortable table. Hot water, sugar, and a box of cigars were placed upon it, and the liveried guests were invited to drink the Queen's health in liquor that had never paid its duty. It was very well known how Bowden obtained his living ; but he managed so well, and kept his premises so free from rows and bad characters, that his illicit trade was pretty much winked at. CHAPTER XVII. Charlie soon tired of earning Frank's salary, and one Sunday he left him to look after the premises and made off for the day. In the course of his rambles he came back to the Ballarat fields, and there saw, floating in the air, a flag with his old ship's name upon it, and underneath this flag a large store. He went in and was warmly greeted by Mr. and Mrs. Patten, who had been fellow passengers of his. They took him in, fed him, and treated him like an old friend. When Charlie had rehearsed all his troubles, and had listened to some corresponding ones from them, Patten said : \" I wish you would come here and help me. I will give you fifty shillings a week and find you in everything.\""], [163, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 157 \"Done along with you,\" said Charlie, \"I will join you to-morrow.\" It was a light pair of shoes Charlie walked back in that evening ; and he told Frank that he should leave the first thing on Monday morning. Frank did not much relish losing such a useful helper, but he was more careless and thoughtless than really selfish, and he was very glad that Charlie had got a substantial offer. In his way he was fond of Charlie, and had done many kind things for him at different times. The real fact was that he had to exercise so much inge nuity in working out the problem of his own means of living, that he had little time to spare for others ; though, when an opportunity did come, he was not entirely heedless of it. The Pattens received Charlie heartily ; they treated him like a visitor when off duty, and as general servant during work hours. Patten contemplated extending his business, and his ambition was to build the largest store yet erected in the fields. The first order he gave to Charlie, was to go into the bush and cut poles, saplings, and uprights sufficient for this purpose. There was a thick bush not two miles away, and there was no difficulty about finding or cutting enough for twenty stores ; the job was to get the stuff removed after it was cut. Only once in a blue moon a horse and cart could be got hold of. The difficulty of horse-keeping debarred any one from running the risk of starting such a thing on the diggings."], [164, "158 ArAGABOND CHARLIE. Occasionally, when some dray came up from town, after delivering its load, the driver would undertake an odd day's work on the fields. Charlie went off with his paper of measurements, and worked away like a Trojan. He was no sneak, and now he was getting good wages, he determined to do good work. \" There is honour amongst thieves,\" has, like most proverbs, more meanings than the literal translation. Now, if Charlie was to cut down a hundred or more poles without any chance of carting them away, it is clear that they must remain some days on the ground at any one's mercy. Plenty of men beside Charlie were doing the same thing, and to everyone's honour be it said, that seldom was a case of theft met with. Charlie, as soon as he had cut a dozen poles, collected them into one heap, and then set to work to make another, and so on until he had established a depot as near home as he could manage. By the end of the week he had brought to the edge of the bush, and within a mile and a half of home, a quantity of timber deemed nearly sufficient. Each day the range of his work became extended, and consequently the distance for carrying became greater. It was no child's play to cut and bark these poles, and shoulder them from place to place. Some were more than he could carry, and he tottered under many a heavy one which tried all his strength and muscle. He did fancy sometimes that a little pilfering went on. SeATeral of his choicest poles that he remembered to have cut one day, he could not always discover the"], [165, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 159 next ; but it might be he could not find them. Once he completely lost himself. He left his lunch beneath a tree, which he felt sure he could easily find, and then wandered about in search of a long straight pole of which to make a flag-staff. Looking upwards in search of this, he had taken small notice of the track. He found a flag-staff but lost his way. It was past mid-day, and he had worked hard and tasted nothing since breakfast ; he went backwards and forwards trying to discover the direction he came from, but to no purpose. The bush, in parts, was too dense for him to mark out a straight line in which to continue. He was too near the diggings, and thousands of his fellow-creatures, to feel much dread about being lost ; but he felt and endured the agony of thirst to a terrible degree. His throat was so dry that he attempted to produce a little saliva by eating tobacco, and this came out of his mouth again like dried hay. A dog called \"Bob\" was with him, and nearly as bad with thirst. For several hours he and his dog wound in and out of the hollows and breaks, and tried to discover some clue to their right track. What they wanted most was water. At length, as they approached an open space, Bob gave a short bark of delight, ran forward, and suddenly disappeared. Charlie came up and found him wallowing in an old prospecting hole, which contained \u2014 shall I say water ? Well, water it might once have been, but now it was a thick, whitey-green, soupy mixture. If the reader can imagine a round hole, about three feet in diameter and five feet deep, half full of cold white soup, with any number of flies and insects as"], [166, "160 VAGABOND CHARLrE. garnish, the green carcass of a dog, and his own live one floating in the midst, it will be something like what Charlie saw as he stood on the edge of this hole. Dysentery, that frightful and oftimes fatal scourge, passed before his mind's eye, yet, had even death himself stood by his side, he would scarce have been restrained. Uttering an exclamation, \" If it kills me I must drink,\" he lay down, and breathing a secret prayer, drank off three hatfuls of this beastly mess. He did not hurry to pull out his dog, but watched with pleasure the delight of the animal, who Avas rolling about and drinking as much as he could, heedless of the carcass of his own race, which had probably made a similar plunge with no kind master's hand to lift him out. Had Charlie not been there, Bob would have shared a like fate, and afforded more thickening matter for the next thirsty arrival. But Bob being extricated, Charlie thought that the sooner he got home and swallowed an antidote the better. The drink had sharpened his wits, and he hit upon the expedient of ordering Bob home, and of driving him on before. The dog soon comprehended the situation ; he performed two or three rapid circles within a radius of twenty yards, then put his nose to the ground, gave a little yelp, and trotted gaily on, and very shortly led Charlie in sight of his dwelling place. Directly he got there he drank off a pint of raw vinegar, and kept supplying himself with alternate doses of vinegar and brandy till he had completely dissipated his afternoon's potations. He turned in"], [167, "VAGABOND CHARLrE. 161 early, slept well (though he dreamt of dog-soup), and rose the next day none the worse. Bob seemed quite aware that he owed his life to Charlie, who Avas also grateful to him for his guidance. From this date they became inseparable companions. Bob was a capital snake-killer ; he and his master had many a hunt together after these reptiles, and if truth be told, the dog was by far the smartest, and had no fear of them whatever. Directly he saw a snake, he ran right at him, and generally caught him j ust behind the head, and then it was all up with the snake. If he was late and missed the spot, he would seize him anywhere, and by a smart toss of his head, send the snake flying up in the air to be tackled as he fell by Charlie. How the dog escaped being bitten was a marvel; often it was a very near thing for both parties. It is possible that Bob knew of some grass or herb, the eating of which prevented the poison of a bite from taking effect. It is said that cats Will attack a snake with impunity, and, if bitten, will retire into the bush, eat some grass or root, and suffer no evil consequence. Whether this be the case or not, it is certainly not usual for a dog to display any talent in this line. \u2022 Enough timber being cut, it was Charlie's duty, with the aid of an old sailor, to build Patten's grand new store. The site fixed upon was over against the Gravel-pit lead, which had fulfilled all expectations, and was one of the richest spots on the fields. The store was to be set up within one hundred yards of the very hole Rice had shepherded. Not long after wards Charlie saw and heard of seventy-seven pounds 11"], [168, "162 VAGABOND CHARLrE. weight of gold being washed out of one tub of stuff taken from this claim. Charlie and his sailor mate were both novices in architecture ; but the essence of sailoring is to be able to turn your hand to anything, either ashore or afloat, so they were not iu the least discouraged. They secured a carpenter for a couple of days, to give them a rough outline and a few practical hints. By the end of a fortnight they had erected a very respectable-looking shop, and, as the sailor said, \" it was wind-tight and water-tight.\" The canvas cover ing was cut out and sewn together in the most masterly ship-shape manner ; and the flag-staff with its nautical fixings, was greatly admired. One incident during this fortnight distressed Charlie dreadfully. Whilst the store was in process of erectiom they lived in a tent hard by. To this tent was brought, as opportunity offered, stock-in-trade for the shop. Amongst other things was a barrel of porter. The night this arrived, Charlie and his mate spiled the same, by an ingenious method not easily dis coverable ; and both had a good pull at the porter. Charlie never thought much of the criminal part of this proceeding till the deed was done. He thought more of the novel and skilful mode in which the sailor went to work ; and he looked upon it more as a school boy's lark than as deliberate theft. This attempt at self-deception brought with it very little comfort ; and, like all men gifted with a con science, his peace of mind was sadly disturbed that night and during the following day. What a pity it was he did not think before he did wrong, instead of after !"], [169, "163 VAGABOND CHARLIE. A repetition of this joke was more than he bargained for, and the next night, when his mate proposed a second drain from the barrel, he stood up and said there should be none of it touched. \" Patten,\" he added, \" sent the goods to them to protect, and the porter was for sale, and ' not to be drunk on the premises ' by those whose business it Avas to guard it.\" The sailor was highly indignant with Charlie and his scruples ; he called him a \"little Goody Two-shoes,\" and said they could never be found out, and then he regaled him with some choice descriptions of his handi work in broaching cargoes. This old rogue positively chuckled over the numerous \" deep, deep draughts \" he had swallowed from puncheons of rum and other spirits, during his board-ship career. However, Charlie stood firm; he said he had yielded at first for the fun of the thing, but he had no notion of carrying on a system of fraud, nor of allowing his mate to do so either. Further, he threatened to tell Patten what they had done, and promised to keep a sharp look-out on the sailor, and if he attempted anything of the kind again, he would show him up. What a convenient article a rogue's conscience must be ! This man could not, or would not, in the least understand that it was no fear of detection that restrained Charlie, but the simple fact that he would not be a thief. It seemed quite beyond the capacity of his judgment to comprehend that anything was wrong which could not be found out. When the store was ready the Pattens came and 11\u20142"], [170, "164 VAGABOND CHARLIE. took over everything, and Charlie was delighted to see the back of this lively-fingered sailor. Up to this time Charlie had had things pretty much his own way, and, barring the one peccadillo, had worked honestly and well, and had fairly earned his wages. Now, he came immediately under the eye of his master and mistress, and a funny time he had of it. Patten was of the grocer tribe, and very grocery he had remained ; from a boy he had been accustomed to sell farthing dips and pennyworths of sugar, till he became a trust worthy manager of a large firm, under whose auspices he was now trading. Not by any means intentionally a hard master, he was yet so intensely shoppy, that he kept Charlie per petually tinkering at little huxtering pieces of trade, with a view to increasing his connection. Mrs. Patten had received her \" broughtins-up \" at a ladies' seminary, in Patten's country town ; and it was during her school-days that she had won the heart of the grocer boy. She was gifted with a most voluble tongue, and never wearied of telling Charlie what she had been accustomed to at home. Poor Patten used visibly to wince under the rehearsal of their early love-making, and of all the tittle-tattle of his native town. Every day she would apologise for the steel forks, the rough-made table, and explain how unaccustomed she was to such surroundings. O At dinner and supper she would be obsequiously polite, and affect the air and grace of a fine lady. All this was wasted on Charlie, who could bear with Patten's genuine shoppiness more than with his wife's absurd"], [171, "165 VAGABOND CHAELrE. pretensions. The amusing part was, that these worthy folks recognised the gentleman in Charlie, and, when he was not at work, were especially civil, but they never let him off an ounce of labour. If he was not up by half-past five, and off a dis tance of a quarter of a mile for two large buckets of water, and if he had not lit the fire, boiled the kettle, and made tea by seven a.m., the lady's tongue was sufficiently unrefined to let him know what it was to come under its censure. Patten never attempted more than a mild tallowy reproof, and a remark that \" he never lost ten minutes in his life ;\" but the wife would open the vial of her wrath full upon him. Whenever this happened she was sure to pet him up at breakfast-time afterwards, and would very likely make a jam tart for his dinner. Charlie took it all as a matter of course, and treated with equal disdain their reproach and civility. He slept on the counter in the middle of the shop, with a good six-shooter under his pillow, and with Bob alongside. There was a good deal of robbing going on, and Patten would often come shivering in of a night to ask Charlie if he heard any one outside ; to which question he only got a cool reply that there was nothing he would like better than to spot some fellow trying it on. He brought Patten to bay one night deliciously ; when he was sneaking about in his usual suspicious way, Charlie challenged him to stand. The little man turned on his bull's-eye lantern, and saw Charlie deliberately covering him with the six barrels. He was in such a fright at this that he shied down the lantern and bolted, crying out :"], [172, "166 VAGABOND CHARLrE. \"It's me! me! Mr. Patten. Don't shoot, for Heaven's sake !\" Charlie gave his Colt an ominous click-click, and sang out : \" All right \u2014 if you had kept quiet you would have been a ' gone coon.' \" Patten paid Charlie no more midnight visits, and expressed himself quite satisfied with his vigilance. Charlie spent a good deal of time behind the counter, but he was a bad salesman, and could never learn'jthe art of doing up parcels neatly. The men buyers were not very proud about that, and it gave him many an excellent opportunity for civil speeches and apologies to the women. Although a bad salesman, he was a good hand at col lecting people round the counter and standing treat. He kept a running account against himself, and at the end of each month got a lecture from Patten, about spending his money so freely. This was all humbug, because for every pound Charlie spent, some one else spent five ; which was clearly a gain to the establish ment. Charlie was allowed free use of everything in the grub line, and as much beer or porter as he liked. All spirits and bottled stuffs he must pay for. When all was shut up he would go in for a regular good supper, and would eat the most luxurious things he could lay hands upon. Patten would exclaim against this, but Charlie always said it was in the contract, and, as he did lots of things that were not, he intended at any rate to live as well as he could."], [173, "167 VAGABOND CHAELrE. In consequence of early rising and the chance of midnight disturbances, Charlie had adopted the simple plan of putting on a clean suit of clothes on Sunday morning, and remaining in the same till Saturday night. Washing was a superfluous arrangement seldom in dulged in, and an odd \" Sunday morning \" would be missed occasionally, which saved a deal of trouble. The Pattens were not church-goers ; and by the time Charlie had performed his daily round of house hold duties, he had small inclination to walk three miles to the one large tent where the Church of England service was held ; so that Sundays were much as other days, without the shopping. Christmas Day was one of great rejoicing, and Charlie laid himself out in preparations for this by choosing an entire new set of garments. A jumper of the loudest pattern, a pair of white moleskin cords, swell necktie and shirt completed the suit. With these, half a bar of soap, a scrubbing-brush, and pair of scissors, he proceeded to a convenient water-hole, and completely metamorphosed himself. He had missed the two previous Sundays, and when stripped was more like a nigger than a white man. The amiable Mrs. Patten scarcely recognised him on his return, and exclaimed, \"Lor, Charles! whatever have you done ? you do look grand !\" and compli mented him in various ways on his good looks. A Roman Catholic tent stood not far off, and to this Charlie went to offer up his Christmas thanksgiving. In outward observance it was a most devout service \u2014 very striking were the attitudes and devotion of these"], [174, "168 VAGABOND CHAELIE. hirsute worshippers. Here was a congregation, a large number of whom scarcely opened their mouths on other occasions without every second word being an oath, now prostrate before their \" Maker,\" \" acknow ledging their wickedness,\" and doubtless, for the moment, \" truly sorry for their sins.\" Shall any one dare say it was wholly a mockery ? On Charlie it made a deep impression, and he came away convinced that there was some good in things most evil. To men once enlightened, however faint the spark of light, or however nearly quenched and suffocated it may become, it is seldom entirely extinguished. All honour then to the noble men, be they Roman Catholic, English Churchmen, or any denomination, who, amidst the \" Chorazin\" of a gold-field, nobly work to fan these sparks into living flames. At dinner-time Mrs. Patten's heart truly melted, and she got so spooney over Charlie towards the end, that Patten ordered her to her own compartment, and sug gested that Charlie might go out, and not return till late in the evening, Off he went for a regular shop-boy's holiday, with his hat jauntily set on one side, so as to display the true counter-jumper's curl over his right eye, and with a cigar in his mouth. He drank all the liquor he could get without paying for it, chaffed the few women he met unprotected, visited a few acquaintances, listened to and told a lot of stories, whose chief point of wit was their unfitness for publication, came home about ten o'clock, and fancied he had had a \" slap-up spree.\""], [175, "169 VAGABOND CHAELIE. Patten had done a first-rate business ; and he often took seventy or eighty pounds over the counter in one day. Gradually, as the gravel-pits got worked out, this fell to forty or fifty pounds, which did not suit him so well. He therefore looked up some of his old customers, and promised to send them weekly supplies ; the all suffering Charlie was to be the means of conveyance. One day Patten filled two large baskets until they weighed some twenty pounds each, and mildly said : \"Here, Charlie, you recollect where Mrs. So-and-so lives ? just take these things, and leaA^e this ham at one place, a tongue and two cheeses at another,\" and so on. Charlie said nothing, but looked at his master with astonishment, and walked off, determined to make a day of it. To carry two heavy baskets three or four miles was one of the items not mentioned in his contract ; never theless he took his time, and did it on the first occasion without grumbling. It was the indignity of the proceeding he objected to more than anything else. Doing dirty work for Mrs. Patten, and standing behind the counter were sore trials ; but to be made a hawker of groceries in a free and independent land, was altogether beside the mark. The next time he was asked, he said : \" Look here, Mr. Patten, if you will buy a horse and cart I will drive it for you with pleasure from here to ' kingdom come,' and deliver any amount of goods on the road, but I will have no more basket-work for you or any other man.\""], [176, "170 VAGABOND CHARLIE. Patten stared and said: \"Very well then, we must part at the end of the month. In the meantime kindly oblige me by delivering this load as it is promised.\" Charlie had half a mind to say, \"Do it yourself;\" but when he looked at Patten's greasy, treacly frame, he knew he couldn't carry the things five hundred yards ; so he shouldered the basket for his second and last piece of hawking. During his absence Patten had time to reflect ; and when he returned, he asked him to stay on, and think no more of his warning. To this he met with a flat refusal, and thenceforth there was enmity in the camp. Charlie spent a good deal of time in looking out for another situation, and Patten was in distress who to get to take his place. To begin with, he bought three beastly bull-dogs and tied them up by day outside, and at night had them all picketed inside the store, much to the disgust of Charlie and Bob ; the latter was highly affronted that his faithfulness should be so lightly esteemed. Charlie disliked, and in fact was afraid of bull-dogs, and never made friends with them. They nearly killed his pet, Bob, before they had been a week in the place, and Charlie ran many a risk of being bitten in his endeavours to save his favourite. These brutes were almost as dangerous to the inmates of the store as to outsiders. Patten was half afraid of them, and Mrs. Patten and Charlie would like to have poisoned all three. Often when the latter was helping himself to supper, he would hear a sharp growl and a snap close to his legs, and would look round to see the under-hung jaw of one of them"], [177, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 171 uncomfortably close to his calves. More than once he was tempted to put a bullet through the fiercest. Patten's timidity about his property drove awaj>- many a customer. Few men or women care to approach a shop guarded by three savage dogs, leaping and tearing at their chains. Quiet peaceful Bob got fearfully mauled, and hobbled after Charlie in the most piteous manner. CHAPTER XVIII. Patten was glad enough to give Charlie sleeping room and his food, long after the expiration of the month. He got a few odd jobs at windlass-work, pole cutting, and slab-splitting ; the pay was good, but the work jerky and uncertain. His last job was sinking post-holes at eighteen-pence apiece, the holes to be three feet deep and tAvo feet in diameter. It was a task that looked easy, but it was precious hard to earn wages at it. The ground was awfully hard, and the small circumference of the holes rendered it difficult to get down the required depth. Whilst working the second day at this, the boss came round and abused him like a pickpocket for not doing more. At this Charlie flung down his tools, told his master to go to blazes, and that if he said another word he would tan his hide for him ; he might keep his money, and find some one else fool enough to do his work."], [178, "172 VAGABOND CHAELIE. The next mail brought a letter from Rice, stating that he had seen an advertisement in the paper about Charlie, which he had answered ; and by this he had discovered that his cousin had a bundle of home-letters for him, and wanted much to see him, and know what he was about. One of Patten's drays had just brought up some goods, and would return at once ; this was a chance Charlie jumped at. It didn't take long for him to pack up. Barring his blankets the whole of his effects could be tied up in a moderate-sized pocket-handkerchief. A settlement of accounts with Patten yielded a total of sixty pounds, which Charlie thought very good for his eight months' work, considering he had spent about thirty pounds more in liquor and clothes. It is hard for people, who are mutually dependent on one another for half the little nothings of everyday life, to live several months under the same roof with out getting in some way attached to each other. Charlie forgot all the disagreeables, and remembered only the many small kindnesses and attentions he had received from the Pattens. He shook hands warmly with both, and heartily wished them the success their honesty of purpose deserved. He begged hard to be allowed to take away Bob, who fawned upon him, and almost spoke the distress he so evidently felt at the departure of his greatest friend. Neither money nor persuasion would induce Patten to part with him ; so poor Bob was made fast and left behind, with a caution from Charlie to beware of the bull-dogs. They made an excellent track that night, and the driver talked of reaching Geelong the next evening."], [179, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 173 When they passed the half-way house, the old \"Queen's Hotel\" still reared its unblushing front to the road; but on the opposite side was a stately mansion, erected with all the newest and latest im- provements. It was not quite finished, but was open for drink and food ; and it looked far more worthy of its name than did the other. Charlie was only too glad to feel independent of the place, and to give it the go by ; he had no curiosity even to call and see if the \"virago\" still dispensed its hospitality. Crossing from Geelong to Melbourne it rained hard all the way, and the deck was crowded. Charlie, ever on the alert to do the gallant to the fair sex, picked out two of the prettiest girls he could find, and arranged a comfortable seat for them amongst the baggage ; he held a corner of the tarpaulin over their heads, and talked meanwhile as if he had found no end of gold. Indifferent to the storm, he thought only of the two fair maidens being completely pro tected. Arrived at Melbourne, he offered to escort them home; this they declined, but they thanked him for his good-nature. Clearly they were no daughters of \"Midas,\" and could not be caught by showers of gold. They left Charlie dripping wet and disconsolate, with a notion that he had been a little Quixotic, and might just as well have kept himself dry. He made straight for his relative's office, and not thinking of his dis reputable appearance, rushed in, and in the presence of numerous clients, hailed the great man as \" cousin.\""], [180, "174 VAGABOND CHAELIE. A wave of the hand ushered him into a back room to await the conclusion of business. His cousin was very kind, but recommended him to be a little more circumspect for the future, and not to burst in and claim relationship with people in the way he had just done. It was pointed out to him that where he had been standing there was quite a puddle of water, and that his whole get-up was not in keeping with the style of connection a man of business was anxious to maintain. The reason that Charlie had been advertised for was that he had never written home since he left ; his friends had sent many letters to him under cover to the cousin who could only get at him through the medium of the papers, an advertisement in which had caught Rice's eye. A bundle of home-letters were now handed to him, which he seized with many thanks and much excite ment. He promised to be more prudent about his entry to the office next time, and then left. The next thing to be done was to get Patten's order cashed, and Charlie thought no small beer of himself as he issued forth from the bank with sixty golden sovereigns in his pocket. He had never handled so much lawful coin of the realm before, but experience taught him it v/ould not go far unless carefully nursed. He was awfully hungry, and longed for something nice to eat. In the window of a confectioner's shop near was displayed a half-cut wedding-cake. This was positively beyond resistance. A smart, pretty little woman behind the counter stared at his request for a \" large slice of that cake,\""], [181, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 175 and insinuated that he could not pay. A judicious jingling of sovereigns produced a change in his favour, and she pressed upon him sundry other dainties which Charlie freely devoured, feeling wholly indifferent as to cost. He wound up with two glasses of cherry brandy, and paid thirteen shillings and sixpence for his blow out, which occupied about ten minutes. He walked away very satisfied that he had got rid of the best part of a sovereign in considerably less time than it was earned ; so much for careful nursing. His reflections about not spending money, like many other people's, were first-rate when he had none to spend, but when his pockets were full, reflections and money evaporated like steam. Rice, in his letter, had said he was still at the Ryans' ; so of course Charlie once more made that his home. Mrs. Ryan was pleased to see her protigi come back looking so well and hearty. Rice and others gave him a warm reception, and that night there was great rejoicing over his return. The Ryans had prospered beyond their expectations ; they had therefore raised the style of their establish ment, and the rate of their terms from thirty to forty shillings per week ; but they would take no additional pay from Charlie, nor from any of their old supporters. Rice had done little or nothing since he came down from the fields. He once tried a water-cart, and for a fortnight might be seen watering the main streets of Melbourne. But he gave it. up, and lost money as usual. He was now in correspondence with Edwards and Rouse about a berth in the Port Fairy district, and he hoped Charlie would go with him when his"], [182, "176 VAGABOND CHARLIE. plans should be matured. Some very nice men had come to the Ryans', and Osmond kept up the acquaint ance ; so that their evening gatherings gave a refining influence to their days. Charlie's good clothes had been carefully preserved by his kind hostess, and he appeared as gay and good looking as any of them. The Ryans were daily expecting some relations from the old country, and report said there were two pretty nieces amongst them. Petticoats were scarce, and the prospect of two pretty girls gracing the board with their presence, put the young ones on their mettle. When the ship was signalled, Rice, Chaiiie, and another man named Williams, hired a boat, and came alongside with an introduction from the Ryans, and brought off the nieces, with a brother and a few light traps. Williams elected himself coxswain, and luckily he knew what he was about ; for,half-way back, an ugly squall came on, and very nearly capsized them. Charlie's knowledge of boating and Williams's coolness alone saved them. They were sailing at a fine rate under a lug-sail, when Williams called out : \" Sit still ! mind the women, and don't move a muscle.\" Rice had hold of the sheet, and Charlie stood by the halyards. In a moment the squall was upon them ; Rice, in his fright, instead of letting go the sheet held hard on to it, and then there were shrieks from the women, and anathemas from Williams. The boat heeled over, and shipped bucketfuls of water, which gave all hands a sousing. For a second"], [183, "177 VAGABOND CHARLIE. the boat quivered and was gunwale under, when Charlie promptly let go the halyards, and hauled down the sail in board. Williams, at the same moment, put the helm hard down, and ran her up in the wind's eye. She pitched and tossed to the no small fear of the women, who fortunately did not move. Charlie got out a scull and kept her head to wind till the squall passed over ; and then up sail, and away they went as merry as before. The girls took their ducking kindly, and by the time they landed all were on capital terms. The little dodge of getting first on board did not answer with respect to the nieces, for not one of the three men took their fancy particularly. They both, as is common in such cases, got smitten with the very men the Ryans objected to most. One was a man who was committing suicide as rapidly as possible. He could swallow a wine-glass full of laudanum at a draught ; and on some days they said he took three. The girl had some romantic idea, common amongst women, that she could cure him and save his life. She might as well have tried to dam up the Red Sea. It was simply a question of time ; and then came the fatal day when her ill-chosen lover either took too much or too little of the poisonous cordial, and put an end to his existence. Then followed the usual heart-rending lamentations over one that could not, and would not be saved. It never was thoroughly known by the Ryans who this self-destroyer was, or when he took to this fright- 12"], [184, "178 VAGABOND CHARLIE. ful excess of laudanum-drinking. They discoA'eredhis habit very soon after he came, and did all they could to check it, and so indeed did others besides. For a man who deliberately chooses this method of going out of the world there could not be very much sympathy ; and very little was exhibited towards the niece. She had rushed at the man with her eyes open, and must bear the consequences. The sister bolted with a fellow who had neither money, wit, nor brains. His only recommendation was the possession of an aquiline nose and a handsome pair of legs. It was rumoured that they went off to New Zealand, where this worthy represented that he had property and friends. Thus ended all interest in the nieces. The brother, a fine young fellow, Avent stock-riding, and did well eventually. CHAPTER XIX. Rice's money matters became an enigma to most people. Setting his original capital at eight hundred pounds, considering his various losses and general mode of life, he must have spent quite double. Yet he still had money and kept pace with the rest. These, like Charlie, were birds of passage, who worked like niggers for a few months to replenish their purses, and then lived handsomely till they got fly-blown, i.e., cleaned out of money. Rice never did any work ; the few efforts he made were very pusillanimous, and devoid of profit."], [185, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 179 A rare time they had of it just now. Richards had drawn his last cheque for fifty pounds, and was as happy and careless as if he had fifty thousand more. Rouse, a brother of the Port Fairy man, had just come out with a few hundreds ; and he thought he had best spend them before he did anything else. At the rate they lived the game was soon up ; but it was a jolly one whilst it lasted, and they each had a capital good innings. During this idle time, Charlie was near coming to grief in the marrying line. Whilst strolling through the public gardens, he came across a charming little nursemaid, with two little kids- \u2014 not her own, but belonging to some wealthy folk who had a mansion at St. Kilda. Charlie made up to the damsel, and soon put the \"come-hither\" over her. The first introduction led to daily meetings in the gardens, followed by evening appointments on the premises of the mansion, and in vitations to the kitchen. It is an old saying, \" Never play with edged tools ;\" and Master Charlie was precious near cutting his fingers with this pretty little weapon. It was one thing to dangle after a nursemaid in a public garden for amusement ; it was another to run the risk of de tection, which he frequently did, in another man's house, and perhaps be called upon to marry the damsel. Whatever the idea, and whether the love was real or feigned, the situation was provokingly awkward. The head of the house was continually on the look out to catch Charlie, who, he suspected, came oftener to his house than circumstances warranted. 12 2"], [186, "180 VAGABOND CHARLIE. One evening when he was comfortably seated in the kitchen, listening to a lot of gossip from the cook, and waiting to make love to the nurse, in walked the master with a stock-whip in one hand and a revolver in the other, saying : \"Aha ! I have caught you at last !\" \" Not so fast !\" says Charlie, and he vanished like a shot, slammed the door, and was gone. He had taken the precaution of always sitting near the outer door, and his many visits had rendered him very familiar with the outer premises. Once outside, there was little chance of his being caught. It was easy for his lover's ear to detect that the heavy tread approaching was not the agile step of the fair Alice, so that he was actually on the bolt when the master entered. He consulted Rice in all his movements, and in this case received the consoling advice that he was making a fool of himself, and had better cut the acquaintance. This was a very easy thing to say, but, in love matters, a mighty hard one to do. He kept up the garden ap pointments, but went no more to the house, and the affair died a natural death. It was instructive in one way. It gave Charlie a splendid insight into kitchen life, and the ideas enter tained therein concerning masters and mistresses. It was scarcely an honourable peep behind the scenes, but in love and war all is fair ; and as Charlie had a good deal of the first and a dash of the second, he pocketed his doubts and thought it all right. Rice's letter from \u2022 Port Fairy was still delayed ; Edwards had promised to let him know when there was some-"], [187, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 181 thing certain, but not before. To Charlie one thing became very certain, and that was that he must get to work again. His sixty pounds were gone, and he must earn some more. Mrs. Ryan knew of a gentleman woodcutter, whom she asked to dinner, and whom she recommended to take Charlie on as his mate. The work was much the same as the cutting up fire wood which he had tried before ; only this time he was with a man who understood the business. Broadwood, a gentleman by birth and education, had committed the folly of marrying beneath him, and was reaping the fruit thereof. He lived in a small tent erected on the back pre mises of one who had known him in better days. His wife had presented him with three children, and for the last twelve months he had supported them entirely by woodcutting. Charlie's first day at this was a regular teaser. He had some notion of hard work, but this was beyond all previous experience. A good six hours at the cross-cut saw, and three more with the axe and wedges, told upon him tremendously. When he came home that evening, he could neither sit, stand, nor lie down, but he literally rolled upon the floor, till kindly sleep brought rest to his weary bones. Next morning his hands were like a piece of raw beef steak, and it was all he could do to hobble to his work. Broadwood only laughed, and said he had gone through much the same himself. He gave him a piece of bacon fat to rub his hands with, and told him to set to again at the accursed saw. For an hour it was like being on the rack, but by"], [188, "182 VAGABOND CHARLIE. degrees he got round, and his hands hardened, and in a day or two he was congratulated by Broadwood for his aptness. They worked extra hours, to make up for lost time caused by an accident, or rather assault and robbery committed against Broadwood some months back. He was coming home from Melbourne, just at dusk in the ev-ening, and was not a mile from his tent, when two men met him and hailed him civilly with a \" Good-night, mate.\" Broadwood walked on unsus piciously. Scarcely had they passed, when he felt himself seized round the body, and his right eye was quickly laid out upon his cheek. Talk of London garrotting ! There is some chance of recovering yourself and shaking off a ruffian who grasps you round the throat ; but on a sneak who is proficient in the art of gouging, there is small chance of retaliation. The operation, if neatly performed, is exceedingly expeditious and effective. The man slips quietly up from behind, inserts the tip of his thumb into the corner of your eye, and scoops it out as you would a limpet or a mussel from its shell. This was neatly done to Broadwood ; and all he remembered Avas staggering home with his eye in his pocket-hand kerchief. A doctor was promptly called in, and the eye replaced in its socket ; but for weeks he was in a state of uncertainty as to whether he would recover his sight. Skilful attendance and careful wife-nursing saved the ungouged eye, and gave promise of ultimate recovery to the other. When Charlie joined him he could but imperfectly see with his left eye."], [189, "183 VAGABOND CHARLIE. Strictly speaking, Broadwood was only allowed to cut up dead timber ; but there was often a chance of removing an obnoxious live tree, which obstructed the view of some inhabitant, who would send a message, accompanied with a consideration, that the tree might be had for its removal. Green trees were rare prizes. In addition to the profit was added the excitement of the fear of being found out. Most of the work had to be done by night, and that night must be a boisterous one to drown the noise of axe and saw. Generally the whole tree was cut up and rolled out of sight by morning; if a large one, parts of the trunk remained, and it was quite possible they might be \" caught in the act \" by a crown ranger. Any fool could easily see where a tree had been cut \u2022down, but it would take a clever fellow to trace it when once Broadwood and Charlie had cut it into two foot lengths and had mixed it with a lot more, or sold it as fast as it was cut. It- was great nuts getting paid handsomely for cutting down a tree, and then selling parts of it to the same party at an enhanced price. Charlie chuckled immensely on one occasion, when he received a five-pound note from the hands of the master who had so nearly caught him waiting for \" Alice,\" in his kitchen. One day, whilst hacking and hewing at an obstinate log of wood, a gentlemanly-looking man came up and asked Charlie if he could tell him where he (Charlie) could be found. The Ryans, on whom he had called, had told him he was working in the neighbourhood. Great was the"], [190, "184 VAGABOND CHAELIE. delight of Charlie, and the astonishment of the inquirer, to recognise in each other old school-fellows and navy shipmates. Charlie's friend had just got his lieutenancy, and had diligently sought him out to celebrate his promotion, It took very little consideration to chuck work, and leave Broadwood to his own devices for the rest of that day and half the next. It was somewhat trying to hear all about the old folks at home, and the cricket-matches, picnics, and dances, which Howard had so lately come from. His accounts re-lit many a secret flame that the boy fancied he had put out by absence, and poor Alice, his late inamorata, suffered sadly by comparison. Returning home late one night, from a Melbourne spree, in his working dress, Charlie observed two men dodging him from tree to tree, and apparently bent on mischief. He had very little property about him, so only con cerned himself to keep his eyes open for a gouging attack. Whilst watching these two he was pulled up short by a third, and was firmly embraced in the arms of a policeman so suddenly that he could offer no resistance. The other two instantly ran up and hailed him as an important capture. He was recognised as a thief and a murderer, for whom these three intelligent members of a highly scientific detective force had been nightly on the look-out for the last week. It Avas no use protesting innocence, or giving any explanation as to where he came from, or whither he was going. One man was ready to swear he knew all about him, and the other two were equally certain"], [191, "185 VAGABOND CHAELIE. that he was a rogue. Charlie was so amused that ho only laughed iu their faces; and his cool off-hand manner rather staggered the policeman. He was cute enough not to say who he was, or that he was living at Mrs. Ryan's : he merely protested against being pulled up, and refused to accompany them to the police station. This, of course, went for nothing; and he was collared and marched off. They thought it superfluous to handcuff Charlie, who was a mere stripling. As they walked along, Charlie expounded to them the folly of their action, and mentioned a few swell names of influence, an appeal to whom, he explained, would easily prove that they had made a mistake. He added, his interest was such that he could get them all three severely hauled over the coals. This did not sound much like burglary or murder ; and these enlightened limbs of the law suggested a compromise\u2014 to the effect that two should remain by Charlie, whilst the third ran back to the station and fetched his superior officer. This agree ment was readily consented to by Charlie, who felt sure that any one possessed with the ordinary gift of common sense, and who was not bolstered up by the extraordinary bumptiousness- of official importance> would clearly see that he was not the right man. On more mature reflection, he thought it would save an indefinite amount of trouble if he availed himself of the absence of number three, A.S.S., and gave the others the slip. Choosing a favourable moment, he gave the one holding him a splendid upper cut under the chin, Avhich made him let go ; and then he delivered to the"], [192, "186 VAGABOND CHAELIE. second a good football throw, and bolted at a pace few bobbies would be likely to outrun. Next morning, on his way to work, he would have to pass the very station to which he had been invited to spend the night: so he changed his clothes, put an additional coat of mud and dirt upon his face, and went by unob served. He recognised one of his blue-bottle acquaint ances, and gave him a tolerably wide berth. A dray- driver came by this day with a large empty barrel as part of his load, and just as he passed Charlie, the barrel rolled off into the road. \" Give us a hand with this cask, mate,\" said he. And Charlie at once responded. For j ust half a lift on to the cart the driver gave him a shilling and many thanks. Charlie said : \" You seem a good sort of fellow. I Avish you would come by twenty times a day ; it would be far easier picking up your empty barrel than wood-splitting. I don't want your shilling: let us go and drink it.\" This they accordingly did. CHAPTER XX. The anxiously-looked-for letter from Port Fairy ar rived at last, and told of Rouse and Edwards having any amount of work ready for willing hands to do. Rice and Charlie settled to be off at once ; and if they sent back a good report, Richards and others would follow. They embarked on board a small coasting steamer,"], [193, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 187 and the third day reached Port Fairy without any misadventure. They landed late in the afternoon, and learnt that Rouse was up country, and not likely to return for days. Edwards they could get no certain tidings of, beyond that he was somewhere busy road-making, and in want of hands. Reduced to a few shillings pocket-money, it was necessary to husband their resources. So that night they slept in a paddock at the back of the town. They cooked their supper by the aid of a few posts and rails, which they helped themselves to without any ceremony, or form of enquiry as to who were the rightful owners of the same. They then spread their blankets tent-fashion over a rail, and turned in. Next morning, as often happens in difficulties, these two friends fell out about the proper course to pursue. Rice was for venturing up country at any price in search of Edwards. Charlie, on the other hand, was keen upon joining a town party of road-makers, and of getting a pound or two of silver before starting. One word led to many, and the result was they seria rated. Rice went off to find out Edwards, and Charlie to engage himself to work. They did not actually quarrel, but their separation was not very cordial. A few hours after Charlie completed his agreement with the foreman of the works, and engaged to come to him next day. But as he was walking along sorely grieved at Rice's departure, and so much vexed with himself that he was even shedding many tears, he met Rice. He was on his way out, of town, and was also sobbing his heart out. They came face to face so un-"], [194, "188 VAGABOND CHARLIE, expectedly, that they had no time to recover them selves, and the situation became at once forcibly ludicrous. Both men pulled sharp up, said what fools they had made of themselves, and burst out laughing. This unintentional exhibition of feeling quite settled all difference of opinion ; and they both expressed a wish to follow one another. Each was as anxious now to do what the other liked best, as he had before been to choose his own line. Whilst Charlie was making his own plans, Rice had discovered that Edwards was only ten miles away ; so to him they determined to go. It was a strange wild place to which they went. Some two miles off the main road was situated a farm house on the brow of a hill. It was surrounded with dense bush, and overlooked a large tract of swampy land. Across this, Edwards had contracted to make a passable road. A considerable amount of engineering skill in the way of drainage was required. Edwards' party was small, and he was glad to augment it with the addition of Rice and Charlie, although they were not trained navvies. Edwards had just completed a contract farther up country, by which he had made a good sum ; and he hoped to do the same Avith this swamp at which he had just commenced to work. It was the middle of the rainy season, and thus gave additional trouble. Edwards had a small tent, which he allowed Rice and Charlie to share, and they encamped on a rising ground near the farm-house. The first night was a rough introduction to bush"], [195, "189 VAGABOND CHAELIE. road-making. It came on a hurricane, lightning and rain playing upon and around them in no ordinary way. The tents were half-blown down ; and the best part of the night was employed in securing tent-pegs, tightening ropes, and holding on to the poles which supported these fragile tenements. The next day, each man had his line of work marked out ; and Rice and Charlie went at it, determined to show that gentlemen could work as well as play. To Charlie it came easy, but poor Rice made very heavy weather of it, although he did more than any one else. They were a queer set of labourers, fifteen in num ber. The gang consisted of two lags, or retired con victs, of no particular nationality. They were nick named \"Moses\" and \"Aaron;\" the first was so called because he was moon-blind, and could only see by day light. A certain analogy was supposed to exist be tween him and the prophet of old ; the latter, according to the riddle, was left in darkness \" when the candle went out ;\" while the convict was in total dark ness when the sun went down and the candles were lit. The second, Aaron, derived his name from being of the same tribe \u2014 a brother criminal. Moon blindness has this peculiarity : although a man becomes quite blind after sundown, during the day he can see very well. This Moses, if his work kept him out late, as was sometimes the case, had to be led home and waited upon at supper, just like a blind man. Aaron, his guide andj companion, treated him on these occasions like a real brother. Three runaway sailors, two Yankees, and six Irish-"], [196, "190 VAGABOND CHARLrE. men completed the working party, as it stood when Rice and Charlie joined it. A continuance of boisterous and rainy weather pro duced such discomfort under canvas, that Edwards arranged with the farmer that he should hand over a large shed for their use, and contract to feed them. After this they lived in comparative comfort, with a good roof o\\Ter their heads, and properly-prepared food. On wet days, when work was out of the question, Moses and Aaron and the sailors adjourned to a public house three miles off, whilst Rice and Charlie went out shooting and helped to fill the pot. Rice was a capital shot, so they never came back empty handed. Wallaby and wild- duck formed the usual game, and capital sport they gave. Wallaby shooting in thick underwood, is a near approach to English rabbit-shooting, and equally exciting. Thanks to Rice's good marksmanship, there was plenty of fresh meat always at hand. Aaron Avas a confirmed drinker; and not only on wet days, but on all other occasions, he managed to have a bottle of brandy secreted somewhere. At night time, he would often be heard guzzling down raw spirits at a fearful rate. He favoured the party with various attacks of delirium tremens ; and when under the influence of this hellish complaint, had a peculiar rage for cutting some one's throat, not his own. He was by no means a pleasant companion in a long open shed, where he could at any moment gratify his desire by seizing some sleepy comrade. He wanted close Avatching at times, for, like any one possessed with a"], [197, "191 VAGABOND CHARLIE. devil, or mad, he was awfully cunning, and could sham sober when most bent on mischief. But he had to deal with men pretty well up to most of his dodges ; and no accident occurred. Edwards would have liked to have sent him away, but hands were scarce, and he and his mate could do more work in a given time than any other three ; so, when sober, they were valuable. Moses often got lost in the swamp on his return from the public, and then all hands turned out to find him. Little diversions such as these continually broke in upon the night's repose, and made the work doubly trying. Edwards had other contracts on hand, so that he only spent a few days at each place. He had put several friends into good positions. Rouse's brother, who quickly followed after Rice and Charlie, was at once put in charge of a gang, and received eighteen shillings a day and all found. Rice fully expected to be made \" boss \" of his party next time Edwards went away ; but a near relation, whom the latter was bound to put first, stepped in and took his place. Bews was a young fellow of no authority whatever, and, when Edwards left, the work slackened accordingly to such an extent that Rice said they must go, as they were only robbing Edwards. Bews had been brought up in a small attorney's office, and knew as much about managing the men over whom he was placed, as the \" man in the moon.\" The work became a regular farce. The men were allowed by right, a quarter of an hour at eleven o'clock for a smoke, and the same again at four p.m. This they usually extended to half an hour, and by turning"], [198, "192 VAGABOND CHAELIE. out late and knocking off early, they considerably shortened the hours of labour. Moses had a watch by Avhich they all elected to be guided, in preference to Bews, the right time-keeper. In vain did Bews re monstrate, and endeavour to keep time with Moses by daily altering his own watch ; there was always a difference of a few minutes more or less in favour of the men. Another dodge wras this : in excavating a long drain through marshy ground, it was necessary for each man to erect a temporary dam in front of his work. If any one felt inclined for a spell, he had only to run his pick through his dam, and down came suffi cient water to stop him and all behind for a quarter of an hour. If the leading man did this (which he did very often), all hands would sit down and smoke, whilst Bews would stamp up and down in a fury, and threaten to discharge them all. One day, Avhen going down to his work, Rice sprained his ankle ; this, and constantly working in the wet, brought out a lot of sores, and laid liim up for weeks, otherwise he and Charlie would have left very soon after Bews came. Directly Rice was well enough to be left, Charlie and the three sailors said they could no longer continue humbugging. One of them went off to Rouse's party in search of work ; he came back with the good news that a settler wanted a large quantity of land cleared, and would pay handsomely, and that three of Rouse's men were going there. Rice promised to join them when his leg was well, and the four went off. On the road they picked up the three men of Rouse's party who had told them of the place and kneAv its whereabouts."], [199, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 193 Late at night they arrived at a Scotch settler's, who stared a bit at seeing seven men, who were ready to work for him. He was canny enough to be civil that night, for fear of losing them all, but in the mornino he would only take on four. This left Charlie and two others, Jack and Bill, on their beam-ends. The district was well adapted for farming, and many small holdings were occupied. They had not to travel far before they came to a man who wanted some fencing done at so much per rod. There was a long stand out for three glasses of rum per man each day ; at last this was given in to, and the agreement completed. Here they worked like Trojans, and made ample amends for their late slackness. They slept in a small apartment adjoining the kitchen, and their meals were cooked and served by a slashing, fine, handsome lassie, who was nothing loath to procure a husband. She there fore paid all three many delicate attentions. Bill was the favourite, but Jack and Charlie, by a little- adroit man\u0153uvring, rendered it a doubtful question who would receive the honour of her hand. She meant to have one of them, that was certain ; and the chosen one for the day would get a fresh egg nicely poached on a plate, with freshly buttered toast, or some other delicacy, especially prepared for him. There was no getting at this damsel anywhere out of the kitchen ; the farmer's wife was far too Scotchy, and kept a keen look-out on her charge now there were three men on the premises. Love-making was too delicate a subject for Charlie to enter upon in the presence of others, but Bill and Jack boldly declared their admiration, and caught the buxom wench round the waist on every 13"], [200, "194 VAGABOND CHARLIE. available opportunity. These attentions led to many a sound box on the ear, and to well-pretended offence at such familiarity. Charlie was not behind-hand in whispering soft nothings when he got a chance ; but she was too masculine, and built on too large a scale to suit his fancy. Besides, he was not quite cured of his weakness towards Alice, who, if she did no other good, kept him from falling into the arms of this hand some virgin. At the end of a fortnight there was a sly look about Bill's eye, and a conscious blush on Dina's fair cheek, which plainly told the tale that Bill had proposed and had been accepted. This was a great relief to Jack and Charlie, who were now on the right side of the hedge, and could chaff as much as they liked with safety. Bill had not only squared yards with Dina, but had agreed to stay and work the farm for the master. Charlie hoped that Bill would be a little less lively under a proper course of washing and combing. It was Sunday morning when he produced one of those abominations called a \" small-tooth comb,\" and coolly called Charlie's attention to the remarkable advantages of this article of toilet. The man's head Avas alive ; and this elegant trap, as it passed through his hair, created a noise like stroking a cat's back the wrong way in frosty weather. The creatures that came forth from his thick glossy head of hair, were such that Charlie had no wish to claim acquaintance with them. What there was more seductive about Bill's head than Charlie's was only known to the animals themselves; yet it is a curious fact that for a whole week both men slept on the same pillow, and never a creature touched"], [201, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 195 Charlie. He did not give them another week's trial after this discovery, but made his shakedown in the kitchen, and did not envy Dina if she married into such a family. Charlie had seen a few natives at his last place, and thought them a very repulsive race ; from their appearance and general habits, he was little inclined to credit them with much sense of either joy or grief, and with none whatever of shame. A good many natives passed by during the time he was on this farm, and they would always stop and beg for tobacco or rum. One old hag took up her abode on the premises, and, for the sake of a little washing which she did for the household, was allowed to remain. This hideous piece of human deformity had a mangy hound for her companion, and by some acci dent her dog fell down the well and was drowned. The dog was fished up from the well, and over his carcass she wailed forth her sorrow. For three days the old woman sat over the top of the well and howled, and shrieked, and daubed herself with mud and clay. Her cries were more pitiful than can possibly be described on paper. With her finger-nails she tore great gashes down her cheeks, which formed complete furrows for her tears to run down. Ah ! and such tears ! no inducement could persuade her to leave the spot, or partake of any food ; and if any one approached to remove the dog, she was more like an infuriated tigress than a human being. On the third day it was imperative that some step should be taken, and the dog was forcibly taken out of her grasp, and buried ; she was led away kindly by 13\u20142"], [202, "196 VAGABOND CHARLIE. the gude-wife, fed and consoled in so far as it was possible, and then bid depart. It was a sad sight to Charlie, and from his heart he pitied the poor woman, yet what could be done ? She scarcely understood a word that was said. The thought struck him, if ever there was a living picture of despair, certainly this Avas one \u2014 and all about a dog ! Surely, under such uncontrollable grief, must lie deep-rooted the strongest feeling of affection, capable in some way of being raised to a high standard. But how ? And when ? Jack and Charlie made seven pounds apiece in a little less than three weeks. By that time they had finished the fencing, and so left Bill in undisturbed possession of his fiancie, three glasses of grog per diem, and employment as general labourer on the farm. CHAPTER XXI. After working successfully together for some time, splitting posts and rails for fencing, and other bush work, Jack and Charlie went grubbing trees at half-a crown a tree. On some land this rate paid well, but not so well as fencing. With a week's hard work they only earned two pounds, which they hardly considered bread and cheese. They quarrelled one morning over a bigger gum-tree than usual, on which they had expended a good deal of time and labour, in spite of which the"], [203, "VAGABOND CHAELrE.'' 197 tree stood as firmly rooted as ever. Charlie's patience was nearly exhausted, and Jack's quite. He threw down his tools with an oath, and said he would not do another stroke, and that nothing would alter his determination. Jack decided on going to town \" fora spree,\" and to get rid of his balance in hand from former earnings. Charlie had heard rumours of a government party who were building a bridge nineteen miles farther up country. He liked the freedom of bush work too much to go back to Edwards' swamp, though he wondered much how Rice fared. It was at a venture that he started through an unknown country, to reach before dark a place he only knew by report. For aught he could tell the whole thing might be a \"shave,\" like many more floating rumours. In England he had heard of and read letters about government appointments of three hundred a year, obtainable at such and such places. In Australia many of these said appointments turned out to be stone-breaking and road- making, at eight shillings a day, with tent, firewood, and water free ; and with rations at a very moderate cost. It required a strong \" Mark Tapley \" sort of spirit to convert the terms of such a situation into a government appointment with three hundred per annum. It was Charlie's first journey alone ; and he missed his companion terribly. The gum-forest, or bush, pro duced in him a curious mixed feeling. He knew he was in a strange wild country over which few white men had passed before, and yet there"], [204, "198 VAGABOND CHAELrE. was wanting that solemn majestic stillness of the American forests Avhich he had read about. Plenty of gum-trees looked grand and ancient enough to satisfy his romance, but there was much home-like scenery continual^ repeating itself. Often he would come upon an \"open\" or break, on which his fancy built a well-remembered homestead familiar to his bojdiood in the old home country. The known absence of wild beasts also gave a certain sense of security and of domesticity to his sur roundings. On his Avay he measured one tree of un common size, and in appearance more like au English oak than the tall ragged-looking gum ; it was a little over six spans of both arms at full stretch. Evidently white men were scarce in these parts, for herds of kangaroos continually crossed and recrossed close in front of him, and evinced little or no alarm. The old ones would often stop and take a good look at him. Encouraged by this, Charlie crept cautiously and unobserved upon one large herd, and for a time thoroughly enjoyed watching these graceful and beau tiful creatures. Some were feeding on all fours, others lying at full length basking in the sun, and others playing and gambolling in the most kitten-like manner. The young ones were especially pretty in all their movements. It was after dark when he reached two tents, and found that he had walked his journey for nothing. The \"boss\" or superintendent was absent, and the half-finished bridge at a stand-still. Want of funds, or something else, had diminished the number of hands required, and no fresh ones could be engaged."], [205, "VAGABOND CHARLrE. 199 Next morning, finding his prospect of getting work uncertain, he started to make his way down to town, to look up Jack or rejoin Rice. In consequence of so much similarity of feature in the bush, he travelled some distance along a strange track before he dis covered that he had missed his way. Presently he came to some patches of low scrub and swamp, and could see here and there a few cattle staring wildly, and running hither and thither, yet showing no signs of animosity, or giving him any cause for alarm. Rice had told him of a very nasty adventure he had met with, when he had been once gored by a savage bull ; many stories were current of men being \" stuck up\" by cattle, aud having hair-breadth escapes. Charlie little thought that he was about to learn what this meant ; but, on coming to another open space, there stood facing him two mobs of cattle, headed by two strawberry-coloured bulls. To pass through or around this formidable array of horns, looked a doubtful undertaking, and Charlie felt by no means comfortable, as he marched on and per ceived that his way led through their centre. He had no intention of needlessly showing the white feather, but, as he advanced, he turned his eyes warily to the right and left, and kept nervously twitching with his fingers at his \"swag\" and other accoutre ments. Should flight become necessary, as he thought for a moment it might, it would be as well to part with some of his trappings. Inside his swag were rolled many miscellaneous articles, viz. soap, brushes, tea,"], [206, "200 A'AGABOND CHAELIE. sugar, tobacco, and matches, a spare shirt, and socks, and one or two books, in all weighing nearly twenty eight pounds. Thus equipped it would be no easy matter to do the \" light fantastic,\" and give leg-bail to the cattle, if uhey had a mind to rush at him; and their appearance and conduct indicated mischief. He had passed, as he thought, through the worst of them, when the two bulls snorted and tossed their heads up,and pawed the ground Avith their forefeet in a menac ing manner. The young cattle raced about, jumping and kicking with their tails aloft and heads down; the older ones trotted along with their tails stiff heads erect, and bellowing in an angry tone. In this predicament, all kinds of ideas passed through his mind. One was that he should put his head between his legs, stick his hands up in the air, and charge the enemy. This, he had been told, was an infallible remedy, and would frighten the wildest cow or bull in the country; but he lacked the necessary confidence in this method of attack. Again he had read that it was possible to stare animals out of countenance, and that a man's voice had even at times driven away the hungry wolf. He tried this, and shouted and even ran a short distance \u2014 but a very short distance \u2014 towards them, trying to persuade them (as well as himself) that he was not a bit frightened. It was no go ! And children's story books are all humbug, or else Charlie's real bulls were unlike imaginary ones. They had plenty of the human voice and eye, and"], [207, "201 VAGABOND CHARLIE. were probably blind as well as deaf, for they paid no attention whatever to Charlie's demonstrations. Uttering a most hideous and simultaneous bellow, which seemed to hit Charlie like an electric shock right down the back of his head to the heels of his boots, they came at him, as the Yankees say, \" like blazes out Of the small end of a musket;\" whereupon he skedaddled, and not a moment too soon. Turning round to run, he tucked his boots and tin pot under one arm, grasped his blankets firmly with the other, and then \u2014 running is no name for the pace at which he went. He literally flew ; his toes scarcely touched the ground, and he felt no weight whatever of clothes, or body, or anything. His heart was not in his mouth, but somewhere, if anywhere, on the top of his head, or in the crown of his hat. He hardly breathed, and his only knowledge of life was, that trees, and bushes, and sky, all seemed flying past and around him, as they do in a fit of giddiness. This sensation only lasted a few moments, or may be seconds ; it was suddenly changed by feeling the hot breath of the now really infuriated bulls -close upon him ; a glance behind showed the whole herd in close proximity, with the horns of the two leaders so near to his hinder parts, that it felt as if they were already penetrating his flesh. The sight caused a horrid creepy sensation to come over him; and it really felt as if some unseen power had given him a sudden jerk forwards, and had lifted him a yard or two in advance."], [208, "202 VAGABOND CHARLIE. So alarming was the crisis, that he involuntarily yelled out : \" Oh, my God ! what shall I do ?\" with the full expectation that the next instant would see him tossed in the air by one beast, only to be caught and retossed by the other, and eventually trampled and gored to pieces. At this moment he espied to bis right a large fallen tree by the edge of a swamp. This afforded him the one opportunity of escape. With a sudden double round the branches, and a dive right through the middle of the tree into the swamp waist-deep, he eluded his pursuers. The bulls were so close upon him, that they came crashing into the branches the same time as himself with tremendous impetus. He lay concealed for some little time within a few yards of them, in some high grass, and up to his arm pits in water. The bulls were furious, and rushed into the swamp up to their bellies, splashing, and bellowing, and making a hideous noise. The rest of the herd ran up and down, seeking their lost game. Baffled and dis appointed, they skulked off in knots of twos and threes, the bulls being the last to give up, as they had been the first to attack. Directly the coast was clear, Charlie lost no time in making his way across the swamp (which was half a mile at least in width), taking good care to put this between him and the enraged herd, which he devoutly hoped he would never see again. He emerged from the swamp cooled, but not col lected ; and his chief aim was to get away as fast as possible from the neighbourhood of the cattle. He"], [209, "203 VAGABOND CHAELIE. could still see and hear them not far from the spot where they had lost him. It was some little time before he had sufficiently recovered his senses, so as to be able to ask himself \" where he was going,\" and to look for a road, or track, to follow. All around was bush, interminable bush, of a wilder and more forest-like appearance than any he had yet travelled over. This did not much alarm him, as the day was still young ; and he reckoned on coming across something to direct him before long. Hour after hour he walked on, and only once saw a stray beast \u2014 to which he gave a veiy wide berth. The day began to decline, and he was still wander ing he knew not where, when the idea of getting lost flashed across his mind. He combated with this, having, indeed, heard Avorse stories of this evil than of being rushed at by cattle. It eventually, however, became only too evident that he was lost ; and when fully realised, this is a situation not to be envied. Charlie became oppressed with a horrible feeling of desolation, and with a strong desire to be changed into anything inanimate around him. The very leaves on the trees seemed companionable to one another, and the sighing of the wind through their branches seemed to hold converse with all but himself. How he envied the birds and insects, or anything which possessed social animal life ! His first impulse was to sit down and have a good cry, as he recalled all the many friends and happy scenes of earlier days."], [210, "204 VAGABOND CHAELIE. They say a drowning man in a second review's his past misdeeds, and then they flash through his mind as vividly as at the moment of committal. Charlie now remembered each loved face, and each loved scene \u25a0 \u2014 their minutest details appeared as plain and distinct as if actually before him. When a man gets lost, it is not exactly by fear that he is overcome, but by an indescribable awe, which often ends in vacancy and total loss of reason. Instances without number could be produced, proving that temporary insanity usually follows after lengthened wanderings ; and without this dreaded result, it takes months, and sometimes years, before a man can entirely recover from the shock given to the nervous system by being lost. Charlie's case was not destined to be so very des perate. He regained his composure, and concluded that crying would do no good. The best thing to do Avas to light a fire, cook some tea, and have a smoke ; and after this to proceed in some fixed direction, and trust iu Providence. He acted upon this sound reflec tion, and Avas able once more to advance. Just when hope again began to fade, and another fit of depression to scare him, he saw, not very far off, a single curl of blue smoke ; and then he coo-oo-oo-weed with a ven geance. After several repetitions, his shouts were answered ; and guided by these responses, he was soon alongside a sawyer's hut, comfortably built of slabs and shingle. The OAvner, who had answered his shouting, came out to meet him. He noticed that Charlie was a bit scared, and was not able to give a very collected account of himself ; so he took him kindly by the hand,"], [211, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 205 and led him to his wife, and told him not to talk or say anything till he had slept and rested. It was with a feeling of deep security and thankful ness that Charlie laid down and sought the repose so much needed to restore his somewhat scattered senses. He woke up refreshed, and found his kind enter tainers waiting for him to join them at supper. In the course of conversation, it curiously turned out that the wife came from the same part of England as Charlie, and that she knew lots of places and people familiar to his childhood ; some of which and of whom had taken a prominent part in his despairing fancy only a few hours before. This necessarily caused an additional link of interest between them, and amply compensated for the earlier misfortunes of the day. At breakfast next morning they told Charlie of a settler, who, they were sure, would give him employ ment. And the man accompanied him as far as the main road, from which, after all, he had not diverged many miles. The sawyer's acquaintance had only just settled, and there was no sign of a homestead, beyond a dwell ing-house of small dimensions, and a plot of ground cleared around it. The inhabitants of this solitary abode consisted of a man and his wife, and a grown-up daughter. Charlie, as he looked round, wondered what in the world could induce any one to settle on such a spot. It looked patriarchal, minus the flocks and pasture. He agreed to clear some more land, but couldn't see what kind of living could be made out of it when it"], [212, "206 VAGABOND CHAELIE. was cleared. However, this was not his business, so he left it for the owner to decide. The irksomeness of working alone was more than he could stand ; and there was no sociability in the even ing. The father was a taciturn, morose individual, and gave him the idea of being a man who had com mitted some crime, and had come away from bis fellows to repent. His wife was a crabbed old stick, and the daughter no better than her parents. Neither of the women were prepossessing in appearance, or fascinating in manner. At meal-times and in the evening, Charlie ogled and winked at this starched piece of goods without making the smallest impression. He once ventured so far as to tickle her by accident, but got such a look of scorn and reproof for his pains, that he abandoned the notion of love-making in such a quarter. A week of this life was pretty nearly as bad as being lost ; so, on the Saturday, Charlie said he would go to town, and took good care not to come back, though he forfeited all pay, and worked his week for nothing \u2014 certainly not for love. CHAPTER XXII. When in town, Charlie came across his old mate Jack, who told him that Rice had left Bews, and was now acting as overseer under Edwards. This was good news, and Charlie found Rice at once, and under his management the work progressed rapidly. Some of"], [213, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 207 the men tried on the old dodges, but they found it did not pay. Edwards had extended his operations immensely, and Avas making preparations to build a bridge across a river fifty miles up country. Bews' drain work was of necessity stopped by heavy rains, and had to wait for the dry season. His gang and Rice's were to join forces, and proceed to the river, and build the bridge. They started one Saturday afternoon, with twenty-eight men and one bullock dray, laden with tools and supplies ; and a tedious journey it was. They did not arrive at their destina tion till the second Sunday evening from the start. All this time they were for the most part wet through. A three-mile track without an accident was quite a wonder. The whole journey was one series of misfor tunes. At one place they broke an axle, and at several more the pole broke. The hoggings and swampings were without number. In one place they came to a wide open swamp, where the water was in many places thigh deep. In the middle of this the dray got stuck and the pole broke. The entire load had to be removed, and carried from one rising ground to another ; and the dray had to be dragged out backwards. Here they were delayed a whole day ; so Rice and Charlie went shooting. Had they possessed a fowling piece, they might have had rare sport with wild-fowl on a neighbouring lagoon, but Rice's rifle was the only firearm amongst them. As it was, one black swan afforded great amuse-"], [214, "208 A'AGABOND CHAELIE. ment. Rice had broken its wing, and was anxious to send a bullet through its head ; he followed this swan and fired thirteen balls, every one of which passed immediately in line with its head, but every time the bird ducked and the ball passed on. At fifty or a hundred yards, Rice could hit a crown piece twice out of three times, and he was greatly riled at this bird., and declared that it ducked at the flash of his rifle, like dab-chicks and divers, who, by this means, will elude the best of marksmen. Charlie laughed, and said it was like the boys at a fair, throwing sticks at a duck for \" threepence a shot, and all fair and no cheating ;\" and that Rice might fire till doomsday, and never kill the swan that way. At last this seemed to be Rice's opinion, and he ended the chase by putting a bullet through its body. Charlie carried the swan home in triumph, and set to work to skin it, promising himself and Rice a good supper off the liver and gizzard; he gave the body away to the others. He took great pains, and when he called Rice, set before him a most savoury, tempting frying-pan. Rice ate a mouthful, and made no remark, but he looked at Charlie, who did the same, with a very wry face. The second mouthful neither of them could swallow, and they asked each other what was the matter ? It turned out that Charlie, in his ignorance of swan anatomy, had neglected to remove the gall-bag from the gizzard, and the entire mess was utterly spoilt. A more knowing cook had taken the skinned car cass, had removed the inner skin also, and had pro-"], [215, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 209 duced a fairly palatable dish. Of this, Rice and Charlie contented themselves with a smell; their own failure had put them off swan diet for the time being. Hunting kangaroo-rats and opossums was great fun in the interims of breakdowns and travel. A deserted soldier and a former scene-shifter were the life of the party. At night-time, round the camp fire, these two men would get up entertain ments of the most grotesque and absurd kind. They would mis quote long pieces of popular dramas, sing comic songs, and otherwise divert themselves, to the merriment and laughter of all. Absurd and ridiculous as much of their performance was, there were traces of talent and misapplied genius in both. Some of the gymnastic feats they accom plished would have attracted a considerable attention in many a more favoured locality. At their journey's end, not having taken off their clothes for eight days, all were truly glad of a wash and of clean garments. Charlie felt so creepy that he was forcibly reminded of Bill and his lively com panions, but, as good luck would have it, a diligent search proved that he was suffering from nothing more than irritation of the skin from wet and dirt. The party was now divided. Rice and the greater number remained on the banks of the river, to make good the road approaches and embankments for the new bridge. Bews, with ten men, moved farther up to cut the timber. They worked together in twos, and there was an ambitious rivalry amongst them as to who should do the most each day ; so there was no skulking this time. 14"], [216, "210 VAGABOND CHARLIE. The situation of the camp and the surrounding country were so beautiful, that it rendered Charlie's toil almost a pleasure ; he was well inured to work, and became one of the best axe-men amongst them. He had for his mate the deserted soldier, who was an honest enough worker, but as great a blackguard, unhung, as the world could produce. The stories with which he regaled Charlie would make an honest man's hair stand on end. Poaching had been his great forte, and at this he was an adept ; and by his own showing he was capable of any villainy short of murder. On the second Sunday, Rice came over and spent the day with Charlie, and a right happy day it was. He brought his rifle with him, and they visited a \u25a0small mountain called Mount Etna, which formed a prominent feature in the landscape. This mountain stood out by itself in the middle of a park-like country. It was covered with dense bush, and the track leading to its summit was narrow, and in parts difficult to climb. From the top they looked down into a deep basin of water, which was said to be sulphurous, and that nothing could live half-way down. As near as they'could guess, it would be three hundred feet or more from the top to the bottom. There arose from it a dense steam, yet it was not so thick but that the eye could penetrate to the surface of the water. All round the water's edge there was abundant vege tation ; moreover, it could not be that the waters were poisonous, as they saw a moorfowl leisurely swimming across. Very strange was this small spark of animal life, in the middle of such a wonderful formation of"], [217, "211 VAGABOND CHARLIE. nature. Rice fired twice or three times, not at this bird but into the water,and Charlie could easily count twenty as the ball descended ; but he was not sufficiently acquainted with gunnery axioms to decide by this the depth of the basin. They found, at the top of this mountain, quantities of small sea-shells ; indeed a great part of the road up was of a light sandy nature, mixed with small shell. They concluded from this, that at some period or another the mountain had been forced up by some volcanic action from the sea's bed ; or else that \" the waters had covered the face of the earth,\" and re ceded therefrom. This inference may not meet the necessary require ment of proof, to establish a fact to the scientific world ; but it was sufficient to set before the humble minds of Rice and Charlie a partial evidence of the \" Deluge,\" having been universal. Whether it was this, or a secret misgiving that they were spending their last earthly day together, cannot be said ; yet, never before had these two touched upon the great questions which so stir the hearts of all right-thinking people. As they sat together on the summit of this moun tain, looking out upon one of the fairest and most glorious pictures possible to conceive, their thoughts must needs turn to the \" great temptation,\" \" the king doms of the world, and the glory of them.\" Then these two hearts struck a sympathetic chord, and for a while beat in true unison together. They ascended the mountain as friends ; they came down as something more. Their parting was not sad, 14\u20142"], [218, "212 VAGABOND CHARLIE. yet very sorrowful ; though they were buoyed up with the hope of meeting again the following Sunday. Rice, in this world, never saw that Sunday. The following Wednesday was a wet morning, and all hands were late in turning out. Charlie had finished his breakfast, and was playing cards with his mate the soldier, when one of Rice's men suddenly appeared, pale and trembling, with the announcement that Rice was dead. Like an arrow from a bow flew Charlie, without waiting for a second word, to Rice's camp. The first glance, as he entered the tent, was suffi- cient to satisfy him that life had been extinct some hours. On inquiry, it appeared that the evening before, Rice had been unusually cheerful, and had remained up later than was his wont. He slept in a small tent alone, and retired to this about eleven o'clock. The morning was so wet that no one got up early ; and Rice's absence from the breakfast meal did not attract much notice. At length, the still ness of his tent caused one of the men to peep in, and there he saAV poor Rice, half in and half out of bed, his head resting on his folded arms upon the ground. An alarm was raised, and every remedy resorted to that could be devised in such circumstances. When Charlie reached the tent, breathless and ex cited, the last remaining hope was gone. No sign of life could be traced on the face of a looking-glass, or by the application of a feather to the lips of death. And then the dread certainty fell upon all, that they had lost for ever in this world, one whom a short ac quaintance had taught them to esteem and admire."], [219, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 213 To Charlie, the blow came with redoubled force, after the enjoyable Sunday wherein he had learnt so much of Rice's true character, and had unfolded his own in proportion. On him devolved the principal arrangements for the burial. That afternoon he Avent to the nearest station, and procured some rough slabs ; with these, assisted by the carpenter of the party, he made a rough shell for the body. In the evening and all night through, it was neces sary to keep watch, and prevent the wild cats from eating the corpse. It was trying work, this watching the lifeless form of one he had just learnt to know so well, and had then so suddenly lost. The coroner came next day, and his verdict was that Rice had died of apoplexy. Immediately this was settled, Charlie gave directions for the dray to_ yoke up, and to travel into town with the utmost speed. He rode in advance, and ordered a coffin to be made, and took all necessary steps that there should be no delay about the interment. It was almost a question whether the town authorities would allow the body to be brought within their boundary. By dint of hard night-travelling, the body reached town the evening of the third aay, and early the next was committed to the grave. It was followed b}' nearly all Edwards' men, who came down as mourners. It was a sad beginning for Edwards' new contract, but it cemented the men together, and they made up for lost time on their return. Charlie had no heart left for anything, except that"], [220, "214 VAGABOND CHAELrE. he had a wish to return to Melbourne, and take with him a few trifling possessions of Rice's, for the pur pose of handing them over to a friend, and then he meant to spend a short time with the Ryans. Edwards behaved most handsomely, and advanced him a sum sufficient at least for a fortnight's absence. Up to this time, Charlie, from some feeling of false pride, had not written home. Now his heart over flowed, and he poured forth his feelings in a long letter to his mother, and from thenceforward kept her better acquainted with his movements. Mrs. Ryan received Charlie most kindly, and was doubly attentive to him in his grief. Osmond had risen to quite an independent position, and was always glad to see him, and talk about Rice, and consult with him as to his own immediate future. Had Charlie possessed the necessary qualifications, he would have given him a place as instructor to the junior boys. From the rich stores of Osmond's cultivated mind, and Mrs. Ryan's simple, yet truthful nature, Charlie gathered much good fruit and consolation. It was to him a quiet, contemplative fortnight, during which he reflected on all that was good which he had learnt from Rice, and grieved over much that was evil, in which both had played their part. The focus of his meditation was fixed upon the mountain-top, and their last Sunday together. Richards was the only man of the old party remain ing at the Ryans' ; and as he was also much cut up by Rice's death, a bond was established between him and Charlie which somewhat healed the wound."], [221, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 215 The busy, active concerns of every-day life soon destroyed the acute feeling of loss ; and as every one was forced from necessity to be \" up and doing,\" there was nothing to be gained by lengthened idleness. At this period a man called to see Charlie, said he had been looking for him for some time past, and asked him to pay him a visit. Butler had formerly been an old family servant, and knew all about Charlie's father, and his uncles and aunts. He had left England years before, and had originally settled in Sydney. His case was similar to many others, who had reaped a rich harvest from the rapid growth of Melbourne and its environs. A few years before the goldfields were discovered, he had ridden overland with some cattle from Sydney to Melbourne. Whilst in this latter place, with a little surplus money in his pocket, he attended a land-sale, and for twenty pounds purchased an allotment of ground, on what was then the outskirt of the town. He returned to Sydney, and thought little more of his purchase, except when his wife got angry, and scolded him for wasting his money on what she thought a worthless speculation. A year or two after he was offered ninety-six pounds for this land, which he accepted, and with the proceeds of the sale he brought his wife and daughter down to Melbourne. Three years later the same land sold for four hun dred pounds a foot, and was made the centre of one of the main streets of Melbourne. The second purchaser thereby made his fortune, and Butler regretted he had"], [222, "216 VAGABOND CHAELrE. not waited a little longer, though he was pleased to accept his wife's congratulations on his former discern ment. Butler had not done badly, for about the same time he bought a small property at Brighton, and made that place his home. He displayed great taste in laying out the grounds, and Avas most successful in his garden cultivation. At the time Charlie visited him, the house and grounds were valued at fourteen thousand pounds. Although their relative positions were so entirely changed, there was no snobbishness about these Butlers. They received Charlie in a perfect spirit of indepen dence, and yet they never pretended to set themselves up on a pinnacle of wealth to which they were not born, nor did they ape the manners of those around them. It was a true pleasure to meet such honest-hearted folks, and to listen to all their family stories, ot days which they declared had been to them quite as happy although then in the position of dependents and ser vants, as they were now surrounded with plenty of this world's goods. CHAPTER XXIII. Charlie had promised Edwards not to prolong his absence an unreasonable time, and that he would surely return; and Richards, having at length ex hausted his capital, declared for going with him."], [223, "217 VAGABOND CHAELIE. Indeed, it was Charlie's money that had supported them both for the last week of their stay at Mrs. Ryan's. To save expense, and to avoid the heavy charges attached to the coasting steamer, they took a berth on board a small schooner, which had been fitted up for passengers. By the time their passage-money was paid, there was little cash left between them. The fitting up of the schooner was a very simple process, she had been cleared out fore and aft amid ships, and a temporary lower deck had been laid down. On this deck open bunks were fitted up all round the ship, sufficient in size and number to accommodate forty people ; but this number could be added to in case of emergency. There was no bedding or any other com fort provided by the ship ; each passenger was sup posed to shift for himself. His passage-money only entitled him to the use of a bunk and his meals. Richards and Charlie paid for and shared one bunk, and with the balance of their money bought a few necessaries in the shape of butter, tea, sugar, a knife, fork, and spoon, and pannikins. Every arrangement onboard this ship was carried out with a rigid regard to due economy. The carpenter who built the bunks must have exercised considerable ingenuity in solving the problem of how to make a limited supply of planks and quartering cover an area double what they ought. At least two inches of space were allowed between the planks that formed the bottom of each bunk, and along the entire ship's length not a screen or partition existed. A passenger reclining at one end could thus obtain a"], [224, "218 VAGABOND CHARLIE. capital panoramic view of all his neighbours, or at least this appeared to be the original design of the carpenter, who had neglected to put any division between each sleeping-place, except a short head-board a foot high. As may be supposed, this simplicity of architecture was not appreciated by the passengers, and the devices for privacy and secrecy were many and curious. Men, women, and children made a total of forty-five, married and single, all shaken together in a most pro miscuous fashion. Altogether it was uncommonly rough stowage ; but it had the advantage of being cheap, and less than half the cost of the steamer. The length of passage was calculated to be three days, so that few brought more of anything than was sufficient for this time. Sailing down Hobson's Bay it blew half a gale of wind ; and when fairly out to sea it was dead against the little schooner. Foul weather and adverse winds had not been taken into consideration, nor provided for in any way by the ship-owners or passengers. The first three days were bad, but the rest of the voyage decidedly Avorse. Not a table or bench of any description adorned the deck, either for use or orna ment ; consequently every one, when not asleep, had to sit up in a most cramjoed position in his bunk, or recline on the deck, or take advantage of his own box if he had one, if not, that of his neighbour, as a resting place. The proportion of women and children to men was as three to one; so that on Richards and Charlie devolved a large amount of civility and attention in"], [225, "219 VAGABOND CHARLIE. ministering to the wants of the weaker women and still more helpless children. They had chosen a lower bunk about midships, and above them was an unfortunate individual who suffered terribly from sea-sickness, and who favoured those beneath him with external evidence of his internal disorder, more often than pleasant. Six ordinary ship's buckets were supposed to do duty for all necessities in the way of ablution, and these served all purposes but the one for which they were intended. So long as the passengers' private resources in the way of food lasted, the ship's allowance was a matter of indifference ; but directly these became exhausted, which they soou did, a serious difficulty arose with regard to quantity as well as quality. In consequence of numerous complaints, the captain forbade all communication with the galley and the cook, and before each meal all hands were sent below and the hatches fastened down. Breakfast would then be furnished in a cheap and expeditious manner. A huge pot, or caldron, of tea, together with a large tub of ship's biscuit, was lowered down the main hatch, and then it was every man for himself and the \" deuce take the hindmost.\" Dinner was much the same, except that the pot, instead of tea, contained a mess of rice, or possibly an apology for soup, with a few sheep-bones floating here and there, which had evidently done duty for meat the previous voyage. The same untempting tub of biscuits accompanied this, with the name of \" dinner \" facetiously attached to it."], [226, "220 VAGABOND CHARLIE. The adjoining bunk at the head of Edwards' and Charlie's was occupied by a married couple, with an infant in arms and a child of four years old ; and the only partition between them was a shawl and a petti coat. The Avoman was highly favoured by nature, and was bountifully supplied with a succulent supply for her infant ; a superabundance of this was twice a day carefully manipulated into a tea-cup, and this home made \" sky-blue \" apparently formed an agreeable addition to the ship's tea. These people had come on board better provided than most of the others, and their little family spread was much envied by all ; though it was questioned whether the dairy from which they obtained their milk was one exactly to be desired. The operation of milking was not carried on in secret, or with any attempt at concealment ; but openly, and in the pre sence of everybody, this two-legged cow would draw forth her surplus half or quarter- pint, with the greatest nonchalance. The younger women would hold up their hands with seeming disgust before their faces, but a close observer could detect the merry twinkle of many a wicked little eye, as it peeped through a cleverly formed chink between the middle fingers, as if they, too, would not mind being placed in a similar situation. The young men, audibly and visibly, gave vent to their contempt for such a disregard of common decency. The old ones would rather gloat over and enjoy the proceeding. Richards once took upon himself to remonstrate"], [227, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 221 with the husband, and for his pains received the reply : \" You mind your own business. If my wife chooses to do what she will with her own, it's no affair of yours, and I think the stuff may just as well be drank as pitched overboard.\" After this very sage remark, Richards shut up, and no one else had the courage to interfere. Amongst the better class of passengers were an elderly man, his wife, and two very eligible daughters. The two girls were decidedly the best looking on board, and they possessed a degree of refinement and good manners superior to the rest. The father and mother had been in the boot and shoe trade, and were saddled, in consequence, with the oppro brious term of \" snobs.\" Why this distinction should be especially applied to the useful and honourable calling of boot-making, did not appear very evident to either Charlie or Richards. They, for their part, considered the old leather-cutter and his family a long way more aristocratic than their neighbours of the \" milky way.\" They had lately given up a lucrative business in a large Scotch city, and had sold off everything at the instance of their only son, whom they had not seen for many years, and who had written for them to come out and share his home. The son had shown his Scotch pertinacity and wisdom, by sticking to his master throughout the gold fever, and had never left his employment with a view to \" better himself.\" He had been for years a steady clerk to a firm in Melbourne, and had been rewarded for his faithful service by the offer of a junior partner-"], [228, "222 VAGABOND CHAELIE. ship, and the establishment of a branch business in Port Fairy. He now wanted his parents and sisters to partake of his good fortune. The one continual theme of the old folks was the anticipated pleasure of meeting their successful son. Apparently the main object of the daughters was to establish a home of their own, in preference to sharing one ever so comfortable with the brother. Richards and Charlie were not the kind of men to let such an opportunity slip by unheeded, and they gratified the vanity of the girls and their own love of a judicious flirtation, to their hearts' content. They drew lots for choice of girls, and in this amicable way prevented all chance of rivalry between them. In the presence of the deluded parents, they drew sweet visions of pastoral pursuits and happy homes, and talked about the necessity of a good little wife to keep a j7oung fellow steady and prosperous, and to make his home comfortable. To the girls themselves, they mixed the love potion still stronger ; and made as though they were the only ones they had ever loved, and spent a large portion of their time billing and cooing with the shoemaker's daughters. They worked the two fair ones up to such a pitch of certainty about their ultimate intentions, that to speak to or pay attention to any other girl, would have been a manifest breach of faith. Bichards and Charlie both had rather confused notions as to the Scotch law of marriage, and breach of promise. Their idea was that it was sufficient if both parties mutually agreed to be man and wife ; and they were correspondingly cautious not to utter the fatal"], [229, "223 A'AGABOND CHARLIE. syllable, which might consign them for life to the partnership of retired shoe-leather, though the}- sailed as close to the wind as possible. It is stated by an able writer of the present day, that \" There is nothing so trying, so absolutely exasperating, as a failure to find food and shelter, and common civility, after the fatigue of travel.\" This truism might be extended to almost any condi tion of life. There is nothing that plays a more important part, humanly speaking, in the temper of man than his daily food. As may be surmised, the scarcity of this essential element of man's existence considerably affected the disposition of all on board this ship. Had the prepon derance of numbers been on the men's side, the consequences might have become alarming. When the private stores were gone, the rush and fight for a share of the food was simply disgusting. A good half-hour before each meal all hands would prepare for action. The women, with their deft fingers and innate regard for appearances, would make all the demonstration of comfort in their power, by laying table-cloths and towels, or any piece of tolerably clean linen, on some small space whereon to set their cups and plates. The men would stand under the main hatch, with pannikins, knives, and spoons, ready to pounce upon the provisions as they were lowered down. Charlie and Edwards were always in the front rank, ready to secure a fair supply for the Scotch family, and not very mindful of themselves. A large amount of abuse was showered upon the supercargo, who had foolishly"], [230, "224 VAGABOND CHAELIE. considered it his duty to look after the ship's interest by remaining on board. Whether it was this man's fault, or the captain's, or owner's, made little difference. On his head rested the responsibility, and on him fell a well-merited re tribution. He was compelled to spend most of his time below, and a watch was set to hound him off the deck when ever he attempted to make his appearance. He was subject to all the petty annoyances that could be sug gested by the irritated passengers. Water would be squirted or thrown into his cabin, and his dinner often waylaid in its transit from the galley ; but little profit was gained from this last man\u0153uvre, as it appeared neither he nor the captain lived more sumptuously than the sailors, who were one with the passengers both in their wants and execrations. On one occasion, the weather being somewhat brighter, most of the passengers came on deck to enjoy a fresh breeze after their close confinement. The supercargo, judging by the merriment around that his presence would pass unnoticed, had the audacity to appear. He was immediately seized and tried by an im promptu court-martial. Richards acted as president, and the members of this self-chosen court found the prisoner guilty of gross neglect, and of conduct un worthy of supercargo even to a coal barge. When called upon for his defence, he laid the blame upon the weather, and the small amount of money paid by each passenger. His sentence was to parade the deck for one hour,"], [231, "225 VAGABOND CHARLIE. bare-headed, and clad in an empty sack, with a bole cut in it for his head and arms, and the words \" Supercargo found wanting\" chalked in large letters on his back ; he had also to shoulder a broomstick, with a wet swab attached to it, and one end gracefully flow ing around his neck and shoulders. In default of this they threatened to duck him overboard. His parade-ground was a narrow passage through a double file of women ; and they looked on and enjoyed the joke, amidst the laughter and chaff of those he had neglected to provide for. The little man was so frightened that he submitted to his punishment with out a murmur. The captain, like a sensible man, seeing that numbers were against him, and that his crew was more inclined to insure the sentence of the court being carried out than to obey any order he might give to the contrary, wisely declined to interfere. He merely entered a mild protest, and apologised on his own account for circumstances over which, he pre tended, he had no control. He anticipated no real harm would come to his supercargo in life or limb, and so let matters take their course. A continuance of fine weather, and the prospect of speedily going on shore, brightened up every one. It would have been hard to recognise in the happy party playing blind-man's-buff, hunt-the-slipper, and other games, the same people who the day before had wreaked their spite on the supercargo, and who, for several days, had behaved towards each other in a manner not the most amiable. 15"], [232, "226 VAGABOND CHAELIE. The last evening good spirits so prevailed that the supercargo was invited on deck, and in a formal manner the court re-assembled, and forgave him his misdeeds on condition that he stood bumpers round. He was so elated at getting off so cheap, that, with the captain's ready permission, he ordered up a small keg of rum, and the cup went round to the health of everybody, not omitting the supercargo. Dancing and games continued with renewed vigour, and it was late before they went below to their rest, on good terms with all the world. The supercargo, in the fulness of his joy, was last heard singing lustily, \" A life on the ocean wave,\" \" Give me the slashing brine,\" and other familiar songs. The conviviality of the evening slightly disturbed the equilibrium of Charlie's and Richards' judgment. They made no end of English promises to their sweet hearts, which they had not the slightest intention of keeping, but they carefully avoided using any expres sion that could possibly bear the Scotch translation of marriage. The father and mother gavTe them a pressing invi tation to renew the acquaintance on shore, which they naturally accepted. The son was one of the first to greet the new arrivals, and in the excitement of their family embraces, these two scamps thought it advisable to sheer off without an introduction to the brother. Charlie's absence had extended itself to near a month, and on his return he learnt that Bews had finished the bridge which poor Rice began."], [233, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 227 CHAPTER XXIV Edwards had now concentrated all his forces upon au extensive range of draining that he had undertaken within four miles of the town boundary; so that it was not long after landing before Richards aud Charlie found out his quarters. Richards was at times an unfortunate martyr to rheumatic gout, and its chief point of attack was his right knee ; in consequence of this, it was at first a matter of doubt whether Edwards could employ him. Fortunately for him, in excavating the drain they came across a large strata of rock which required blast ing, and this afforded an opportunity for Richards to be taken on as powder-monkey. By this time Edwards had collected a considerable number of men ; and as the work was calculated to last at least six months, they established quite a settlement of good substantial canvas houses and tents. About ten of the men were married, and most of these had families ; so that there was an air of comfort about the encampment superior to what Charlie had before experienced. He and Richards occupied a large tent with Edwards and Rouse ; and, except on the works, there was no social distinction between them. The majority of the men were Irish, and any friend of Edwards' was sure to be well treated. Charlie they most of them knew and liked, and it did not take long for Richards to gain their goodwill. There was no enmity towards them on account of their recognised 15\u20142"], [234, "228 VAGABOND CHARLIE. superiority ; on the contrary, there was a tacit under standing that any approach to equality was out of the question, and yet in all mattei's of labour no difference was made. The work was hard, but the many counteracting influences made it very bearable. Edwards and Rouse had a good stock of books, and were fond of whist, so that in the evenings, these four passed their time pleasantly enough. Thev usually spent Saturday evenings and Sunday in town, and this formed an agreeable change. Some idea of the nature of the work may be formed when it is stated that the channel through the rock was to be twenty feet wide by fifteen deep. It went by the name of a drain, but Charlie thought it looked more like cutting out a small canal. The head quarry-man was a sagacious old Scot, with a wife and large family, who had spent the best years of his life in a slate quarry in Scotland, and who was well acquainted with the style of work, and fully alive to the dangers of blasting, and to the accidents likely to occur through carelessness or inexperience. The old fellow was very slow and sure, being caution personified ; and this was no wonder, considering he was the only one who had any previous experience of blowing up rocks with gunpowder. The method adopted in this case was for a dozen or more small holes to be jumped, or bored, and then all fired at once. Old Campbell would submit the loading to no one but himself ; the firing off, or lighting the fuse, he was not averse to delegate to another. This usually fell upon Bichards with his game leg, whose"], [235, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 229 duty as powder-monkey compelled him to be in con stant attendance on Campbell. The latter would, when all his charges were ready, judiciously retire, and leave Richards to dance about pretty smartly \u2014 with his slow match \u2014 like a lamp-lighter, so as to get out of the place before an explosion. There were several narrow escapes, but thanks to Campbell's precautions, nothing happened of conse quence. Charlie had a lesson, which was quite enough to complete his education. One of the charges missed fire, as he was standing near old Campbell, who had waited at least twenty minutes before he would move. Charlie became impatient, and said : \" It must be all right now ;\" and in spite of the old man's warning, he advanced. When within a few yards of the spot, he felt a slight trembling motion under his feet ; and the same instant a smothered explosion took place, and a huge piece of rock flew straight up in the air uncomfortably close to his head, and fell within a few paces of his feet. After this, Charlie was quite contented to be guided by Campbell ; and he would have waited a whole day rather than be the first to approach an un discharged shot. The hotel, or public, patronised by Charlie and his friends, was kept by a man who was the fortunate possessor of a very pretty and engaging little wife. She turned up her nose at Charlie and Richards, whom she fancied common working men ; but fascinated, by her charms, Edwards and Rouse. These two, being principal and manager, and consequently large men in"], [236, "230 VAGABOND CHAELIE. a small place, she considered well worth powder and shot. The landlord Avas a careless indifferent innkeeper, but a great man for racing and general horse-dealing ; and spent much more of his time in the stable and on the turf than behind his own bar. He left the care of the establishment, and the entertainment of guests, to his wife, who was well able to attract plenty of custom, and who paid special attention to all Avhom she thought would pay well. Besides the wife, there was a lady companion in the house, who held a nondescript position: no one could make out exactly what she did. Snubbed by the landlady, Richards and Charlie made up to this friend, whom, from her peculiarities, they nicknamed the \"puzzle-monkey.\" They called her this, because it was impossible, from her manner, to gather what were her intentions. She was not particularly attractive as regards face or figure. Her language and manner were most deceptive ; at times she could almost successfully pass herself off for a real lady ; at others, her slang and behaviour would preclude all idea of this. She was justly proud of an extremely well-turned foot and ankle, and was never shj' of exhibiting it. Indeed, it was a common practice with her whilst holding con versation with a visitor, to cock her leg over a chair, or stick her foot on the corner of the table ; but this she did in such an artful manner, that no more of her leg could be seen than just above the ankle; and she affected an air of such apparent sang froid, that it was doubtful if she performed this feat with any immodest"], [237, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 231 thought. That she had a \" bee in her bonnet\" was tolerably clear. She was well off ia point of money, and was fond of proclaiming her independence, and of talking of her private income. Rouse sounded the landlady as to this mysterious female, but he could get nothing from her, except that Miss Blundell was a distant connection, and sufficiently her own mistress to do as she liked, and that she had taken a saucy to living with her. Richards and Charlie did their best by turns to find out what the girl was made of, but she was either too clever, or too cranky for them to learn much. She never stood behind the bar, nor took any active part in the business of innkeeping; but she could most days be met and conversed with in a little back parlour, and she usually presided at the table d'hote, and did the honours in a most engaging manner. The number of dinners and the quantity of brandy and water consumed by Richards and Charlie over this petticoat riddle, made a considerable hole in their wages. What with the \" puzzle-monkey\" on Sundays, and the billiard-table on Saturday nights, they turned out to work each Monday morning, as a rule, with empty pockets. The difficulty was to get this fair charmer beyond the precincts of the hotel ; and if ever either of them caught her alone, he had to keep a respectful distance ; and no attempt at undue familiarity was permitted. After a good many dodges, Charlie did succeed in getting her to go for a walk one Sunday; but she was so stiff and prim the whole way, that he fore-shortened the time, and returned with the conviction that matri-"], [238, "232 VAGABOND CHAELIE. mony was the only style of love-making she Avould countenance. This would not exactly suit either him or Richards, so they gave her up and fell back upon the Scotch lassies, upon whom they thought it was about time to call. If they were to be married, they resolved to do the thing together ; and to have something sound in mind, and not so provokingly vivacious in limb. Love making, during the intervals of navvy work, did not prosper. Their reception at the Scotchman's house was not at all to their minds. The girls were as amiable as ever, but there was an evident coolness on the part of the old folks ; and they met with a decided rebuff from the brother, who gave them plainly to under stand that the feAver visits they paid to his house, the better. He was far too much a man of the world to be hood winked by such greenhorns as Richards and Charlie ; and he had heard exaggerated reports of their proceed ings at the hotel, and rightly concluded that they were not the right stamp for his sisters. He had himself been a money-grubbing plodder all his life, had gained his proud position by constant application to his busi ness, and put no faith in any other method of succeed ing. Outwitted by Miss Blundell, and repulsed by the opulent storekeeper, Richards and Charlie gave Cupid the \" go-by,\" and stuck to their billiards and brandy and water for recreation. They curtailed their visits to town, and devoted their Sundays and wet days to shooting. They could get any amount of quail in the immediate neighbourhood of the camp, and,"], [239, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 233 without travelling far, could supply their larder with plenty of these delicious-eating birds. When they could make a long day, they visited a large lagoon, and potted water-fowl. This latter sport was one day near ending Master Charlie's career of love-making and shooting entirely. The vegetation around and upon the surface of this lagoon was so dense, that it was quite possible to walk hundreds of yards upon the top of the entangled mass of rushes and weeds, which formed a series of vege table islands and promontories. They had been fairly successful, and had bagged several duck and wild geese from the banks, when, excited by the sport, Charlie crept out on the weeds to a large flock near the centre of the lake. It was a reckless thing to do, for underneath the bed of weeds upon which he crawled lay water of an unknown depth, and a weak place might at any moment render a ducking certain ; once through the top surface there would be small hope of his recovering himself. He succeeded in approaching within range of the flock, and, at his first discharge, killed two fine birds. Now came the difficulty. How was he to get at them ? There they lay in full sight not sixty yards off, but between them and him were two narrow channels of water, and to pass them was the puzzle. On a hard road he could easily have jumped these channels, but on such a treacherous foothold to attempt a jump would have been little short of madness. He knew that the lake was in part fordable, for he had seen natives crossing it at times ; so he crept cautiously"], [240, "234 VAGABOND CHAELTE. near the edge of one channel, and planting his gun firmly into the bed of weeds, he let himself down and found it was in his depth, though rather above his belt. There was, as he thought, very little current, and he had no difficulty in maintaining his foothold. But now the point was to surmount the next bed of weeds ; this he could not do, they yielded so much to his weight that he durst not make more than one or two efforts, and, moreoA-er, he could not recover his former posi tion. Striking out, as if to swim, was not to be thought of; any action of the kind would have entangled his legs and drowned him on the spot. The birds in a direct line were now not more than thirty yards off, and he noticed that, following up the channel he was in by a circuitous route, it would be possible to procure them. With the aid of his gun as a resting-bar, he slowly proceeded, gauging each step as he advanced, as if (and indeed it was the truth) his very life depended on the issue. As he neared the ducks his situation Avas one of extreme peril, and yet he would not retreat. He looked back and saw Richards gesticulating in an awfully excited manner, and heard his shouts of recall ; but having gone so far, and being almost with in reach of his prey, he felt no inclination to retire. He reached the end of the weeds, and holding fast with one hand he stretched out his gun with the other to reach the birds, but its muzzle was still a good six feet from them. \" Now, then,\" he thought, \" what shall I do ? Three steps more and the ducks are mine, but in those three steps where shall I go ?\""], [241, "235 VAGABOND CHAELIE. He stood uncertain for a moment, and then put one foot forward, and felt the bottom was declining, still he would not give up. The second step brought the water up to his arm-pits, and he made sure he was lost. He just managed to fish hold of one duck with the end of his gun, and then turned, as he thought, to his friendly weeds. To his dismay they had receded four or five yards, and he was left standing beyond the reach of their support. All thought of ducks vanished from his mind at this sight, and life was now the rub. He durst not quicken his movements, even had he had the power, for the bottom, on which rested just the tip of his toes, was too rotten to admit of much pressure. For a few moments he was in an agony of suspense. Each step a-s he retreated seemed like a year given back to his life, and ten paces brought him to his haven of weeds, and to comparative safety. The channel he followed luckily led into shallow water, and, ere long, he staggered into the arms of Richards, outstretched to receive him. The exertion and excitement had been so great, and concentrated into such a short space of time, that he nearly fainted, and would, in all probability, if alone never have reached dry land. Richards had been the whole time in a fearful state of excitement, and had followed as far as he knew could be of any service. Had he beeu foolhardy enough to do more, both men would assuredly have been lost. Richards was too thankful to see his friend safe and sound to remonstrate much at the time ; but that even ing he gave Charlie a bit of his mind, and told him, if"], [242, "236 VAGABOND CHAELIE. that was his idea of duck-shooting, he had better for the future go out alone. CHAPTER XXV. When the quarry work was finished, Richards' \" occu pation was gone.\" He could no more Avield a pick and shovel, or wheel a barrowful of dirt, than he could fly; so he betook himself to the horsey landlord, and became his stud-groom and general manager of the stables. Here Richards was much more at home than when waiting on Campbell. He was a first-rate hand with horses, and when his gouty knee permitted, an ex cellent jockey. The landlord was making great preparations for a race meeting which was shortly to come off, and Richards had the training of two horses and a pony, all three he confidently expected would be winners. The pony was a beautiful creature, and little doubt was entertained of his success. One of the horses was second favourite, and the other well up in the betting. Edwards and Rouse jointly owned a good horse which they partially trained ; but as neither were horsemen, a good deal of this rested with Charlie, who acted under Richards' instructions, and devoted a por tion of each day to sweating and galloping. Many a good spin had he with Richards when testing the capacity of their rival steeds. The race-day was"], [243, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 237 looked forward to with great excitement in Edwards' camp, and formed the constant topic of conversation and speculation over the evening pipe and fire-light. Charlie's morning gallops over a short course which he had marked out were duly criticised, and the result made known to Richards, who was divided in his interest of duty to his master, and a strong feeling in favour of Charlie and his mount. The great race of the day was to be a four-mile steeple-chase, for this there were only three entries, and it was expected the third horse would be scratched ; the contest would then remain to be decided between Shamrock and Chieftain. Shamrock, the horse Richards was to ride, was colonial bred, but with a large amount of Irish blood in his veins : a tall bony horse with lots of stay in him, and without his match in jumping if he chose, but he had a devil of a temper. Richards had spent much time and patience upon Shamrock, and the horse had, under his hands, become much more tractable than he was ever known to be before. Still Richards expressed great doubt as to whether he could make him keep the course ; if once he bolted, he said, it was completely beyond his con trol to hold him. Chieftain was an imported horse, well broken, and as docile as a lamb, not so fast as Shamrock, but a certain fencer, and he took his leaps with an ease and grace very different to the hot, rash way Shamrock would fly everything he came to. The pony race was well contested, and Richards had the honour of winning by half a length. The next flat race, he came frightfully to grief just after the"], [244, "238 VAGABOND CHAELIE. start ; before they had gone two hundred yards an up-country jockey rode right across his ground, jostled and sent Richards clean out of his saddle, and rolled both man and horse to the ground. The thing was done with such apparent purpose and judgment, that strong suspicions were entertained of foul play. The indignation of the crowd was very great, the race was disallowed, and the owner of the horse disqualified from taking further part in the sports of the day. Richards was picked up stunned and much shaken, but with no bones broken. He came round in about twenty minutes, and recoArered sufficiently to remain on the ground and witness the steeple-chase ; of course all chance of his riding any more that day was hope less. Richards' master was furious, and made no scruple in asserting that the accident had been contrived on purpose to prevent his horse being ridden to victory. It was whispered that he was on the eve of a financial crisis, and had staked his all and more upon the race, so that, to him, the disabling of his jockey Avas a dire calamity. Richards tried hard to persuade Charlie to take his place, but he had no inclination to risk his own neck and another man's fortune on such a venture, when so many better riders were on the ground. Moreover, Charlie had not such an exalted opinion of the horse ; he had ridden him once or twice, and had found him a cross-tempered brute, much more likely to go his own Avay than his rider's. His mouth was like a piece of cast-iron, and when his monkey was up he"], [245, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 239 would go like mischief; but no dependence could be placed on the course he would take. The betting was nearly even on the two horses, but was slightly in favour of Chieftain, more on account of his steadiness and surety than for his speed. Amongst so many men accustomed to the saddle from their cradle, there was no difficulty in obtaining a jockey in place of Richards ; but no one knew the horse so well, or understood his awkward disposition. From the way Shamrock took his preliminary gallop it was plain he meant going. His rider soon got on good terms with him, and a close race was antici pated. The third horse was scratched, and the race remained with Chieftain ; Shamrock took the lead in style, and cleared his first four fences magnificently. \" Twenty to one\" was in every one's mouth as the horse settled down to his Avork, cleared a wide water-jump, and bounded across an open flat a dozen lengths in front of Chieftain. He kept his lead throughout the race, and the excitement amongst Edwards' men was uproarious, as they shouted \" Ould Ireland for ever !\" \" Shamrock's the boy !\" \" Shamrock wins !\" The owner stood rubbing his hands with delight, and was already receiving the congratulations of his friends as Shamrock cleared his last fence in a faultless manner ; and there remained only a short run home. Whether it was the shouting of the populace which scared him, or whether it was something else he disliked, was not known, but suddenly the beggar shied, wheeled sharp to the right, and bolted. Chieftain, meanwhile, had kept steadily on his course,"], [246, "240 VAGABOND CHARLIE. and long before Shamrock could be brought to his bearings, crept up, and ran in an easy victor. From start to finish, Shamrock had shown such decided superiority that every one felt vexed and disappointed at the result, and but small praise was given to Chieftain. Shamrock's owner was driven to desperation, de clared he would shoot the horse, anathematised its rider, and proceeded at once to stupefy himself with liquor. Richards was vexed, but glad Charlie had escaped the mortification of failure, and the maledic tions showered upon the jockey for his misfor tune. The races had given a sporting tone to the whole community, and for several days, quoits, wrestling, and other games were much sought after. Many a portly dame and fair young maiden came in from the country to enjoy the holiday-making. In Edwards' camp a party of relatives came on a visit, and quartered themselves on the married folks. Amongst these visitors was a beautiful specimen of the Irish peasant girl ; she was tall, graceful, and good-looking, and she at once attracted Charlie's attention. Rouse was too well occupied in town to take much notice of her, so Charlie, in the absence of Richards, had it all his own way. During the stay of the country girls in camp, the evenings were devoted to dancing, singing, and card playing, to an extent slightly detrimental to the pro gress of work. Charlie soon got first favourite with the \" slasher,\" and made the running so close that she and her friends"], [247, "241 VAGABOND CHARLIE. settled it as a foregone conclusion that they must get married. \"Hang marrying!\" thought Charlie; \"what a rum thing it is all the girls out here seem bent on matrimony !\" In England they had never dreamt of such a thing, and many a fair one had listened to his vows of affec tion in the most affable manner, without assuming to herself the prospect of marriage. It seemed a mighty hard case that he couldn't carry on a harmless flirtation, without the dread of wedlock hanging over his head like a \" Damocletian sword ;\" yet so it Avas, and rather than be without some string to his bow, Charlie ac cepted the situation, and went in heavier than before for his intended spouse. His flirtation was brought to a climax sooner than he expected. When he had advanced, as the girl and her friends thought, beyond retreat, he was invited to join a jolly party in town. On his arrival he found a large circle of acquaintances (chiefly Edwards' men and his own mates), assembled round a well-spread table. At its head sat an uncle and aunt of the bride-elect, by whose side a place had been judiciously reserved for Charlie. At first he felt somewhat dumfoundered at this meeting. It looked ominously like a wedding-break fast, or an engagement-feast prior to the ceremony, and if freely partaken of, it might entangle him in difficulties not easily got out of. His misgivings were of no long duration. A good feed, plenty of liquor, and a pleasant fragrance of cheap rose-water, united to the sweet smile of a 16"], [248, "242 VAGAEOND CHARLIE. pretty woman, were not exactly the surroundings to make a man miserable. Without much difficult}', Charlie gave himself up to the pleasure of the moment ; occasionally he was brought to his senses by the whisperings of the old aunt, who kept pouring into his ears the perfections of his wife to be. The uncle kept priming his glass with \" Dhrops of the rale crittur,\" and saying to him, \" Drink fair, my boy, drink fair ! whiskey and love are the things to ' make a man merry and Avise.' \" Between the two Charlie got somewhat hazy, but he was thoroughly alive to his position when all hands stood up, and in bumpers proposed, \" Long life and prosperity to the happy pair.\" He responded in suitable terms, and then felt \\7ery much like the owner of Shamrock after his defeat. He did not threaten to shoot the girl, nor did he abuse any one, but he swallowed an alarming amount of whiske}'. At the break up of this love-feast he was warmly embraced by all round. The half-drunken slobbers and kisses he received from the men were so over powering, that they could scarcely be obliterated by the tender soothings of the \" Maggy by his side.\" To be caressed and petted by a pretty girl was rather nice, but to be hugged by a party of hilarious relatives was decidedly objectionable, and uncommonly nasty. On his way home Charlie had time to reflect; ho was forced to the conclusion that he had made a pretty considerable fool of himself. He had cried \" Wolf, wolf,\" so often that the animal had fairly caught him at last, and unless he invented some plausible excuse,"], [249, "ArAGABOND CHARLIE. 243 he would shortly become a householder in earnest, and then no longer his own master. He hit upon an expedient, novel in its way, but which proved most efficacious. In the evening, when all returned to camp, he shammed drunk, and was so unwell that he called for assistance. Nine-tenths of the men were not very prompt to reply, but the women flocked to his tent directly they heard he was ill. As soon as he had mustered a good show of petticoats round him, he rolled about, and pretended to be in a hopeless state of in toxication, Avhile he made this the burden of his song : \" Oh, what will my wife say ! what will my wife say !\" Such an utterance completely staggered the old ladies who had before been so officious ; they threw their arms up, and exclaimed, \"What a young viper ! To think of his having a wife all this time, and we to know nothing about it !\" Then they all flounced out of the tent, and left Charlie, to continue his well-feigned alcoholic reflections. His ruse answered even better than he had calcu lated, for the next morning \"Maggy\" departed, and would not even condescend to give him a parting inter view ; this was great nuts to Charlie. Every one was silent upon the events of the night before ; Charlie pretended he knew nothing, put on an injured air of innocence, and demanded the cause of the girl's abrupt departure. He was told by the aunt that he was an artful little sinner, and that any girl was well quit of him. Charlie did not press the question, and allowed the old ladv to maintain her opinion. He ventured upon 16\u20142"], [250, "244 VAGABOND CHARLIE. no further remonstrance, but rejoiced to find himself once more free. Rouse and Edwards were greatly tickled at the joke, and used their discretion as to letting out the truth. The shamming drunk, which, on Charlie's part, was easy under the circumstances, was so admirably done that no one suspected the young rascal of such deceit. For a long time he was credited Avith having bolted from his home, leaving a real Avife in England. Amongst the many varieties of the insect tribe which Avorried and annoyed the men in camp, perhaps fleas were the most troublesome. To Charlie and Rouse, Avhose hides were not so tough as their neighbours, these pests were an intolerable nuisance. To make their lives at all bearable, it was necessary each morning to hang out their blankets and bedding in the sun ; and during the breakfast hour it was a soui-ce of much amusement to sit at the tent door, and watch the antics of these \"lively and artful dodgers.\" Unlike the small and insignificant English flea, these Australians were large and of great distinction. They ran to the size of small lady-birds ; and from the dis tance of twenty yards, Charlie could count them by tens and fifties, as they made their appearance from the woolly covert of blankets. Reminded of the old story of the two gamblers, who for Avant of better appliances pulled hairs out of a cushion, Charlie and Rouse used to bet upon the number of fleas they could count upon each other's blankets. The first hundred up scored one shilling to the good of the owner ; and each succeeding fifty was worth sixpence more. Any number between fifty and"], [251, "245 VAGABOND CHARLIE. a hundred was left out of the calculation. They kept a daily score against one another, and on Saturday evening the flea account was regularly squared off', with any other gambling transaction of the Aveek. Just as is commonly the case, amongst whist-players of equal skill, for the game to fluctuate week by week, so did theirs ; and at the end of their time, little was lost or won. The odds were evenly balanced, and the fleas, like cards, bestowed the run of luck upon each in suc cession, with \\Taried partiality. Edwards' contract was near its completion, when, one day, Charlie was called away from his work, and told that a man down the road Avanted to speak to him. As Charlie approached, he saw indeed a sad spectacle. Before him stood a tall, ghastly, trembling skeleton, of what had once been a stalwart man. It was several minutes before he recognised the emaciated frame of his old mate Jack. When working with Charlie months ago, Jack had given evident signs that the demon of drink could easily master him ; but he had no conception how rapidly and completely he would become its irretrievable victim. Jack's account was, that after leaving Charlie he had come to town, and had given himself up entirely to the vice of intem perance. It was the old and bitter story. As long as his money lasted he was well treated ; that being gone, he became a hanger-on at public-houses, and lived upon the free-handed, but ruinous, hospitality of others. Several severe attacks of delirium had totally inca pacitated him for work; the result was that, partly from inability, and in a great measure from shame, he"], [252, "246 VAGABOND CHARLrE. had been afraid to look up any of his old associates, and had drifted from temporary insanity into a dull, listless state of despondency. In his last extremity, he had crawled, rather than walked, thus far, to ask Charlie's help for the sake of old acquaintanceship. He wanted nothing but a few shillings to procure him the whereAvithal to continue his drunken debauch, until, as he said, death should put an end to his misery. In this stage, fallen and degraded as he was, Jack still preserved one little sense of shame and disgrace, and no argument of Charlie's could induce him to appear amongst his old mates. He protested that never again could he do a day's work, and that there Avas nothing to do but to drink himself into his graAre ; and the sooner he reached that resting-place the better. Charlie emptied the contents of his money-bag, which he carried, sailor-fashion, round his neck, and was vexed to find that five shillings was all it contained. This sum he gave to Jack, with a sad misgiving as to the kindness or cruelty of the deed. The man was past redemption, but he doubted whether it was right to add even this small amount of fuel to the expiring fire. The eagerness and gratitude with which Jack clutched at the money, as if he saw in it a means of hastening the end he so much desired, somewhat cleared Charlie's conscience. He had at least given one moment of comfort to this jaded and self-convicted outcast. Not long did Jack remain when once pos sessed of fresh means to quench his unnatural thirst ; nor was Charlie at all inclined to prolong the inter-"], [253, "247 VAGABOND CHARLIE. view. Jack's voice had a querulousness and indistinct ness pitiable to listen to, which told, all too plainly, of the coming self-destruction that must speedily follow on the course of life he had led during the last few months. Returning from his interview with Jack, Charlie had a timely Avarning of the uncertainty of his own existence. He was running smartly back to his work, and took a flying leap over a fallen tree. When in the air, he espied on the ground a large black diamond snake (one of the most venomous kind in the country), and upon this snake he must inevitably light. An electric shock of fear passed through him like light ning ; he made a desperate second leap in the air, and landed \u2014 Avhether upon the snake's back or clear of it, he could not on the instant tell, nor did he stay to consider, but went off like a shot for the next twenty yards without drawing breath. Recovered from his fright, he called a couple of his mates, and they went back to examine the spot ; there they saw the distinct marks of the coil of a snake upon the ground, and the print of Charlie's heels within half an inch of the circle ! His two mates looked at him and said : \"Well, youngster, you have had a precious narrow squeak, and you may thank your stars you did not tread on the reptile.\" Charlie did thank his stars, and it took more than half a day to knock it out of his head. It was a curious coincidence, that the very next day, almost on the same ground on which he had talked with Jack, he met their fellow-mate, Bill and"], [254, "248 VAGABOND CHARLIE. his wife, returning to their farm after a week spent iu town. The contrast was most striking. Bill looked the very picture of health ; and his blooming partner the essence of good-natured happiness. They also had met poor Jack, and tried to help him, but he was as deaf to them as he had been to Charlie. CHAPTER XXVI. A few days before the end of the drainage work Edwards told Charlie he had sent in a tender, which he hoped would be accepted, to build a bridge over another river fifty miles beyond the former one ; and that, as Rouse had obtained a more lucrative berth, and intended leaving when his present engagement was completed, he (Charlie) was to take his place as manager. In the meantime he had better ride up and examine the river and surrounding country. It was commonly reported that no heavy timber could be procured nearer than thirty miles from the river, and the contract was reckoned a difficult one to make money at. Charlie was away for ten days, and he found that travelling at another man's expense, and riding another man's horse with his own spurs, was rather a jolly sort of life. He put up in style at all the publics, and lived on the fat of the land. Arrived at the proposed site of the bridge, he took a three days' survey of the neighbouring country, and"], [255, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 249 returned fully satisfied that timber enough and to spare could be had within a radius of ten miles. This knowledge he wisely kept to himself until he made his report to Edwards, who was delighted with the information, and said Charlie had well earned his expenses, which he acknowledged somewhat exceeded his estimate. Edwards had provided for the thirty mile carriage of timber, so that, if Charlie's report proved correct, there would be a considerable saving, and a larger profit than he first expected. Edwards could not keep his men in a state of idle ness ; so he paid them off, with a promise of re-engage ment directly his affairs were settled. Charlie and some half-dozen more, he kept on at nominal wages. It happened to be harvest-time, and plenty of work could be had close at hand, so, meanwhile, Charlie went in for a bout of reaping under the guidance of old Campbell. He had tried manual labour in many shapes by this time, and hitherto he put down cross-cut sawing as the most trying to his back and loins; but it was nothing compared to reaping. At the end of his first day he could scarcely crawl home ; and the next morning it was all he could do to make a fresh start ; but, like most difficulties, it was mastered in a few days by pluck and perseverance, and came as easy to him as any other physical task. There was no neces sity for Charlie to have done this, but as he was in future to lead his men, he was careful to show that he meant work to be done, and would put himself in a position to show them how."], [256, "250 VAGABOND CHARLIE. Edwards secured the contract ; Charlie received his appointment, and made preparations for the journey. His experience and knowledge of the men enabled him to choose only those whom he could depend upon for obedience and hard work. He selected three married men ; this would give him a woman to do the cooking ; another to wash for the main camp ; and a third to join the sawing party. His tour of inspection had shown him that it would be necessary to form an outpost for preparing the timber. With the exception of the old soldier and scene-shifter whom he retained, all his men were Irish ; and his judgment was not misplaced ; one aud all proved themselves to be good men and true. They Avent up under much more favourable circumstances than Bews and Rice had done. The season was dry, and there were no nasty swamps to cross. Moreover, a knowledge of the route for half the distance Avas a great help ; it enabled them to avoid many of the old sticking places. He had thirty men, a two-horse cart, besides the bullock-dray, and carried many more personal comforts than before. The journey up was remarkably expeditious, and devoid of any accident or much excitement. Passing the old encampment where Rice had breathed his last, and the distant view of the ever-memorable mountain-top, were sad trials to Charlie, and brought tears to the eyes of many others besides himself. After this their track lay through a country new to all except Charlie, and he had made but his one rapid transit up and down. They came to a township where they halted for a day, rested beasts and men, and"], [257, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 251 endeavoured to purchase a bullock in place of one that, through the neglect of the driver, had strayed away the day before. Two days later they travelled in the wake of a vast fire which burnt up the country for miles. The whole of their journey was more or less trying for want of water, but it was not oppressively so till they reached this scorched-up land. For a day and a half they suffered the misery of combined thirst and heat. It was heart-rending work driving the poor bul locks through this. Exhausted and weary, these patient and humble beasts of burden dragged their heavy load, with their tongues swollen and hanging out of their mouths, uttering continual moans of distress, yet still using all their failing strength to proceed. The horses and men fared better, in being able to rinse their mouths out occasionally with the water that was carried. Travelling through this fire was most irksome ; not a blade of grass was to be seen, and only on the topmost branches of the tallest trees could anything in the shape of verdure be visible. Burning logs and standing hollow trees shot forth their unquenched fires, or sloAvly crumbled into ashes ; the smouldering embers filled the atmosphere with a choking powder of charcoal dust, and rendered the air they breathed hot and suffocating to an intense degree. All were thankful, the second day, to see green pasture and verdant trees once more. The poor bullocks, immediately they felt the cool breeze fan"], [258, "252 VAGABOND CHARLIE. their stifled nostrils, put forth the whole of their remaining strength, and ran forward at a trot. O O ' Gladly did many hands hasten to release them from the yoke, and a welcome sight it Avas to see them go straight away to a small creek hard by ; although they rushed in and defiled this already not too clear water, no one had the heart to stay them, notwithstanding that they knew they would themselves have to drink the polluted stuff afterwards. Here Charlie ordered a halt for two days ; this gave every one a chance of washing their clothes, and of recovering their baking. The place chosen for the bridge was on the outskirts of a small village. The village boasted of its public house, blacksmith's shop, shoemaker, a large store, a school, and conventicle, and about a dozen private houses. It took a couple of days to get all comfortably housed under tents and shanties, and then the main Avork commenced. Edwards had given Charlie ample instructions, had furnished him with all necessary plans, and had promised to come up and superintend the building of the bridge, when enough wood was O o ' O cut, and the roads made which were necessary, iu order to carry on operations with despatch. He meanwhile paid a visit to Melbourne to make preparations for his intended marriage. The contract he had just completed rendered him sufficiently independent to justify his taking this step, which he had for some time contemplated. The old soldier became so attached to Charlie, that he made him his right-hand man ; half the men"], [259, "253 VAGABOND CHARLIE. remained at home, and made the roadway and ap proaches, and the rest, with the soldier as captair, went off each morning and dispersed themselves about, cutting timber wherever they could find it\u2014 a task that was no sinecure ; it entailed a large amount of walking, as Avell as of cutting and sawing. Often the distance from one tree to another would be a mile or more, and a long way from the camp. Each day Charlie was in a state of uncertainty as to Iioav much and whereabouts they could find their supply ; but they never drew blank. Day after day, the bullock driver brought in his proper number of cross-beams and uprights, and the work went on swimmingly. Although Charlie was now \" boss,\" and had no occa sion to put his bauds to anything, he did not keep them in his pocket. He was constantly on the alert, encouraging and assisting his men ; wherever there was a harder task than usual, he would do a large share of the heaviest work himself. By this means he became most popular amongst his men, and a favourite with the villagers. They were camped within three hundred yards of a public-house, and yet, during the whole time, not one man missed a day through drink. The first Saturday night, Charlie stood enough rum to make all hands O ' D happy without making beasts of them ; and he pro mised to maintain this as a custom, if no one abused his liberality; and the men were true to the trust. A month elapsed before Edwards came up ; and when he had inspected the work so far as it had gone, he expressed himself well pleased with all that had been done. He said he could not leave the affair in"], [260, "254 A'AGABOND CHARLIE. better hands, remained only tAvo days, and then took his departure. When in Melbourne, Edwards had fixed the date of his wedding at about tAvo months hence. The brother of his intended was suffering from cold and inflammation on the lungs, and change of air was recommended ; so he came up with Edwards to remain for six weeks as a guest of Charlie's. It was most providential for Charlie that he never was left entirely without some congenial spirit, to keep him from falling into bad habits, or to prevent him from contracting a too familiar association with men of a different stamp. White was a remarkably quiet, gentlemanty man, not very learned or deeply read, but of a most amiable disposition and agreeable manners. He shared Charlie's tent, and amused himself by riding and shooting whilst Charlie worked ;' and in the evenings would enliven the camp with his concertina \u2014 an instrument upon which he was no mean performer. It was seldom that Charlie could find time for sport of any kind just now, and White was too ill to travel far and wide for game, which was scarce. His shooting was chiefly confined to the destruction of parrots ; these he declared made excellent food. Charlie many a time eat them to oblige his friend, but to his taste they were uncanny eating. The flesh was hard, very gummy in flavour, and of a deep orange tinge in colour, not inviting to the eye. White's taste was peculiar, or else it was vitiated by his complaint ; he had a ravenous appetite, and, in addition to his parrot delicacies, Avas fond of adorning the supper-table with fried gum maggots, an abundant"], [261, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 255 supply of which could easily be obtained from the timber daily brought in. These maggots were about the length and breadth of a man's thumb, and when alive resembled a magni tied sample of those often found inside nuts. When cooked, or dry-parched on a shovel (the correct way of preparing them to White's fancy), they looked like yelloAV chrysalises. No amount of friendship or per suasion could induce Charlie to taste these abomina tions, and he remained in happy ignorance of what they were like, though White was not the only man Avho affirmed them to be delicious. The river, what there was of it, afforded very little sport. Fish might be caught in abundance, but they tasted so mudd}r, and were so full of small bones difficult to separate, that even White gave them up as not worth their salt. Occasionally a flight of wild ducks or geese would give him a chance of producing a more savoury dish than that formed by parrots or maggots. Like many Australian rivers, this one was nothing more than a lengthened disconnected chain of water holes. The distance which separated them varied from a quarter of a mile to as much as two or three miles ; and the intermediate space was only a dry channel, which, in places, could hardly be traced. The settlers of the country said that in the rainy season it was wide and extensive, and often for weeks impassable at the point over which the bridge was being erected. One deep hole, not far from the camp, was a favourite rendezvous for that very curious specimen of nature"], [262, "256 A'AGABOND CHARLIE. the \"Platypus.\" White tried hard to shoot these, chiefly, Charlie believed, with a view to eating ; but they seldom showed above water, and were exceed ingly shy and difficult to approach. They appeared to have much the same habits as the water-rat, and left traces of their feet upon the banks, with other unmistakable signs of their presence. When seen on the water, all that was visible was just the tip of the nose or beak bobbing about like a fisher man's float ; this afforded a very small mark to aim at, and even if struck very little damage was done to its owner. White lay in wait for them fer hours, and called in the aid of the soldier, who exhausted all tho sciences of his poaching craft in his endeavour to capture one ; but neither of them succeeded. Indeed, the only one Charlie ever heard of being caught, Avas a stuffed one in possession of the landlord of the public; and he appeared to have a very foggy notion how he came by it. Charlie had a fine opportunity here of studying the aboriginal natives in a wilder and more natural state than those he had seen in more civilised parts. A tribe of nearly two hundred came and settled down for a fortnight, close to his camp. It was a rare thing for so many to be seen together, and remaining stationary for any length of time. These Avere supposed to be travelling far into the interior for the purpose of avenging themselves on a distant tribe for the loss of one of their own number, who had died a natural death. Their belief was, so far as Charlie understood it,"], [263, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 257 that when any one or more of their tribe died from sickness, or causes they could not comprehend, it was necessary to exterminate au equal number of some other tribe, and consequently the death of one led often to the massacre of many. They were now making a collection of baked \"possum\" and gum maggots for their inland journey. They made no kind of hut that could be worthy of the name, their only shelter was a rough \" mia-mia \" made of bark rudely placed at an angle against a tree, or supported by a few upright sticks. A feAV green branches screened off a part reserved for the women. Many of the men were of good average height, and fair muscular development, and they were neither hideous nor deformed. The women were not beauti ful, certainly, but very superior to what Charlie ex pected. The young girls had an amount of grace and symmetry which rendered them far from repulsive. He noticed that the majority of the tribe were more cleanly in their personal habits than he had been led to suppose. Every morning, the young girls, under the surveillance of a few old hags, would take their bath in the river ; and the men kept scrupulously out of sight during the morning ablutions of these sable virgins. The meu were not afflicted with an hydro phobic mania, but constantly sported in the water with great enjoyment. They had a strong superstition about certain parts of the river, touching a monster animal which they believed inhabited some of the water-holes. They called this dreaded apparition in their own language the \" Bun-yip,\"\u2014 anglicised into \" Devil-devil.\" 17"], [264, "258 ArAGABOND CHARLIE. Except in large numbers, they would not go near the banks of any suspected water-hole, and no one would bathe in, or use its waters for any purpose. So far as Charlie could learn, this Bun-yip, or \" Devil devil,\" was a kind of fresh-water \" sea-serpent,\" most firmly believed in by the natives, and said by them at times to appear and cany off no end of little children ; anything strange and unaccountable they attributed to his interference. This beast had been seen by white men only four times, and on each occasion the white beholder was alone, and so frightened that he could give no more than a confused report of what he saw, though the accounts agreed in pronouncing it of enormous size, and of hideous and terrific shape. These superstitious natives were much struck with the bold assurance of Charlie's men, in utterly ignoring the existence of this myth, and showing their con tempt by openly washing in and using the water they were themselves afraid to approach. They were reserved and shy in communicating with the white men, except on the subject of tobacco and rum; these two articles they would barter and beg for to any extent. Amongst themselves they apparently led a very happy life. The early part of the day they played games, threAv boomerangs and spears, and went through various martial exercises. Towards evening their hunting O O parties Avould assemble, and on their return, at all hours of the night, there would be great dancing and singing over the spoils of the chase. One game they played very much resembled our"], [265, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 259 English hockey, or bandy, with this difference : sides were formed, two goals marked out in the usual way, and the ball tossed up in the centre. Then the great art of the game was to keep the ball in the air, and to drive it through the adversaries' goal without touching the ground. Perhaps battledore and shuttlecock would be a better simile. If the ball touched the ground, a fresh toss up was afloAved, and, very like a touch-doAvn at foot-ball, a free hit-off commenced a new era in the game. A vast deal of science and agility were displayed in this game, and the whole was carried on with a good humour and spirit creditable to any community. The hockey-sticks were made of a species of pliable reed, with a round piece of wood at the end : they were about two feet in length, and were very much like a bulrush head, or a big drum-stick. These they handled with great skill and dexterity. The women, during this game, would suspend all labour, and sit round in small circles, and duly applaud any marked superiority, or jeer at any repeated failure. The way these nimble darkies climbed trees was very interesting to Charlie, with his sailor-like propensities. No tree, however tall and smooth its sides, would baffle them if they knew there was a \"possum,\" or any animal secreted in its branches or hollows. They would tap the trunk in a peculiar manner with a waddy (a short thick stick), and whether it was that their sense of hearing was more acute than ours, Charlie could not make out, but they could detect by the sound if anything alive was aloft. And often, when he or any other white man would have declared 17\u20142"], [266, "260 VAGABOND CHAELIE. nothing was in the tree, they Avould utter an ejacula tion equivalent to our \" all right,\" and immediately proceed to mount. The size of the tree was of no account. With a little sort of wooden tomahawk they would hack a small notch just sufficient for the tip of the finger of one hand and the big toe of their feet, and by a series of well-directed strokes they could walk up the tree in a wonderfully short space of time. All were not expert at this, and there was as much rivalry exhibited in tree-climbing as at other hunting feats. Throwing the boomerang was another extraordinary performance, to excel in which was their height of am bition. Not more than half a dozen were really able to make this ingenious weapon perform all the various gyrations it was capable of when rightly handled. All of course could use it well enough for hunting and warlike purposes, but few could do what might be called its fancy work. An expert hand could throw it for a distance of one hundred yards as straight as a dart, and as swift as an arrow, or he could make it strike the ground violently about six paces in front of him, from whence it would rise with incredible velocity a hundred feet in the air, and twist and turn in its course as if driven by magical force ; and after many windings it would come gently back within a yard or two of its starting point ; or he could throw it in such a way as to make it form a com plete circle and drop harmless at his feet. In fact, the combinations of effect an able hand could get out of his boomerang were marvellous. It was also remarkable that it was only by a fluke"], [267, "261 VAGABOND CHAELIE. that a perfect boomerang could be made, and the natives could not explain wherein the secret lay. Amongst a bundle of a hundred or more all would look exactly alike, and yet, probably, not more than two would possess the necessary balance, or shape, or whatever it wanted to render it faultless. CHAPTER XXVII. The supply of spiritual food in this village may have been very instructi\\re and comforting to those who understood it, but to Charlie and White it was sadly deficient. They attended the conventicle one Sunday, but Avere so unaccustomed to the ranting discourse, and O ' extempore prayers that they came away disappointed. They once rode sixteen miles to a neighbouring town ship for a Scotch service, which was very impressive, and more like their own English Church. O Most of Charlie's men were Roman Catholics, and, at their instigation, a priest would now and then come a long distance to give them counsel and advice. On O O these occasions the early part of Sunday would be spent in a more than usually quiet and orderly manner ; and Charlie, as he had been in Ballarat, was again forcibly struck with the visible impression made upon those around. Even the old soldier, with all his iniquities, would, after a mass or service, remark to Charlie Iioav much better he felt. In his position of manager and acting engineer,"], [268, "262 VAGABOND CHAELIE. Charlie was a man of some importance in the village, and he had the entre'e to most of the houses. He had tried his hand sufficiently at flirting with young girls, and so now contented himself with the society of married people, and had every reason to be satisfied with the exchange, for they were free from any design, and were quite as affable and sociable in manner. His chief friends were the landlord and lady of the public, the schoolmaster and his wife, and a delightful widow lady and her daughter, who kept the general store, and supplied the village, more or less, with its daily wants. He had a good joke with the schoolmaster. It was notified by manuscript hand-bills, that, twice a week, dancing lessons would be given at the school, and any one desirous of \" terpsichorean education \" should at tend. Charlie at once ordered a pair of dancing-pumps and on one of the evenings appointed, he appeared. He took his place in the class and went through the preliminary steps with indifferent aptitude, and at the end of his lesson suggested an attempt at a waltz or a galop. The instructress, the schoolmaster's wife, was not averse to a spin, nor to putting her instructions into practice. The spirit-stirring music of a favourite waltz, and the discovery that the mistress was a first-rate dancer, were too much for Charlie's head to keep cool under. He laid aside all semblance of a novice, and spun round the room with his partner, twisting and guiding her through the assembled pupils with a rapidity and exactness that astonished them all. He was no longer the awkward \"navvy,\" clumsily affecting the"], [269, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 263 clmssez, retvrez, and avancez ; but was at once trans formed into a courteous and practised habitu6 of a ball room. The master stood transfixed with astonishment, whilst his partner, carried away with the same glorious delight as Charlie, called for waltzes and galops in quick succession, to the no small derange ment of the usual routine of the instructive pro gramme. At first the husband clenched his fist, and was inclined to be furious ; he called Charlie an impostor, and other hard words, but to no purpose. Charlie was in far too good a humour with the wife, and the surroundings, to get up a row and spoil a quantity of sport, which he saw looming in the dis tance. The end of it was that the master came to his senses, and Charlie explained to him that he was anxious to perfect himself in the \" schottische,\" a dance he was not so clever at as the waltz or galop. So he cooled down, and invited him to supper and a rubber of whist. This introduction led to many very pleasant evenings, and Charlie generally managed to present himself once a week at the dancing lessons ; but hence forth he assumed more the position of an instructor than pupil. The schoolmaster turned out a capital fellow, and the wife very superior to the position she held, but she had the good taste to keep this to herself and not to com plain. Under the comfortable roof of the store, Charlie and his friend spent many an agreeable evening ; the daughter was engaged to a neighbouring settler, and the mother, who was very much after the style of Mrs."], [270, "264 VAGABOND CHARLIE. Ryan, had seen more prosperous days in her time. She was only waiting to get her daughter settled in life, and then she would throw up her business and return to England, to end her days amongst her rela tions and friends. White and Charlie both agreed that in this far-off settlement they found more sociability and true refine ment than they had met with in Melbourne and larger places. Towards the finish of the bridge, Edwards came up and, with the assistance of the landlord of the hotel, set on foot a grand gala day, at which there would be horse-racing, foot-races, and athletic sports of all kinds. Edwards intended to enter two horses; one, he thought, would certainly Avin the hurdle-race. As bad luck would have it, two days before the race he lost the best horse and took a good deal out of the second in hunting for the first. He found the missing one in time for the races, but neither of the animals were in the condition he would have liked. One horse came in second over the hurdles, and the other was beaten hollow on the flat. The horse-racing was mild and all over early in the day, the latter part of which caused more excitement. The trial of man against horse was well contested \u2014 several fiist-rate stockriders were confident they would win. The man was to run fifty yards whilst the horse galloped one hundred, and in all cases the man carried off the prize. It ought, perhaps, to be stated that the horse had to gallop fifty yards and back again, and it was this compulsory turn that gave the man his advantage. A straight run for the horse would have"], [271, "265 VAGABOND CHARLIE. been all in his favour, and would have materially altered matters. The soldier and Charlie beat all comers at wrestling and sparring, though they met one or two rough customers, so that the issue of the struggle was some times doubtful. Two buck-jumping horses afforded great fun ; a prize of twenty shillings was offered to any one, not a stockrider, who could sit either of them for a quarter of an hour. Most amusing were the efforts amongst O O Charlie's men to carry off this prize, but none of them succeeded. The day after the races Charlie had to put his spar ring ability to some more practical use than with the gloves. Two men were oti the road to town with a bul lock dray of wrool, and in the course of conversation at the public, they heard of the previous day's proceed ings. One of them had won several prize-fights in his time, and considered himself more than a match for most men. When so young a man as Charlie was pointed out to him as the winner of the fighting laurels, his \" dander riz,\" as they say, and he exclaimed : \" What ! Not able to thrash a youngster like that ? Let me have a go at him.\" And Avhen he had fortified his courage with plenty of bad rum, he stood forth in the village centre and challenged any one to fight him. A message was forthwith sent to Charlie to come and prove if he was as good without the gloves as he unquestionably was with those muffled protectors. Charlie had no notion of fighting in cold blood, or"], [272, "266 VAGABOND CHARLIE. for the amusement of a half-drunken ex-member of the P.R., so he declined to attend, but sent a message to say that if the man was sober the next morning he would do battle with him, quite hoping that this would end the affair. Unfortunately, the next morning the pugilist was as determined as ever to try his skill, and came down with his \" pal \" to Charlie's camp, and called upon him to stand out and fight fair. This second challenge was not refused, and Charlie told his men to see fair play, but on no account to interfere \u2014 a precaution by no means unnecessary, for, with half a hint from Charlie, these hot-blooded Irishmen would have there and then shillalah'd the two men into mummies. A ring was formed, and in a \"quarter less than no time,\" Charlie gave his opponent such a dressing doAvn that he skulked off to his dray, yoked up his oxen, and came no more to invite a quarrel. He was as much surprised as greatly enraged, at being beaten by such a bo3r, whom he had thought he could easily master. CHAPTER XXVIII. When Edwards went away he gave orders to Charlie to follow in a few days, and take his men to the bridge where Rice had been, and then to harden the road on both sides. On their way back they recovered their lost ox in rather an unexpected manner. When in the neighbourhood of the place where the ox had strayed,"], [273, "VAGABOND CHARLIE. 267 Charlie sent out scouts in all directions to look foi st; but they returned, saying they had seen plenty of cattle, but \" Old Tom \" was not amongst the number. Travelling on some six or seven miles they saw in the distance a solitary ox, whose bellow was answered by his former mate in the yoke. After three or four suc cessive bellows responded to on both sides, the stray ox came trotting forward to reconnoitre, and, satisfied with his inspection, without waiting to be driven, or in any way being compelled to do so, \" Old Tom \" came galloping on, and with many a leap and snort of delight fell into his old place by his comrade's side, and sub mitted to the operation of being yoked up with evident satisfaction. The driver was in great glee, and made a pet of him ever afterwards. As they appioached the old camping-ground, Charlie noticed a rather alarming discussion going on between the English and Irish. The latter had grave super stitions about returning to the old spot where Rice had died, and they talked of ghosts, and apparitions, and \" Banshees,\" and a lot more rubbish to such an extent that Charlie saw some marked action was necessary. To settle the dispute and prevent the men giving way to such false notions, he ordered his own tent to be fixed on the same ground as poor Rice's, and the rest of the camp to be formed as nearly as possible like the old one. It was really no spirit of contempt or indifference which led Charlie to take this step, but simply a desire to stamp out in its infancy any maudlin sentimentality that could lead to no good, and perhaps might create a useless panic. For a day or two there"], [274, "268 VAGABOND CHARLIE. was a little uneasiness and a small division in the camp, but very soon every one resumed his former cheerfulness, and thought, or at least talked no more of ghosts. This neighbourhood abounded in kangaroo, and one day after a hot chase, a mother, to avoid her pursuers, discharged a young one from her pouch. The dam escaped, but the little one was caught and brought into camp, where it soon became a general pet. It was surprising how rapidly it grew, and it became so tame that it would follow the men about, and sit on its haunches and watch them at work. At meal time it would take its share of whatever was going. The mild, deer-like expression of its eyes, and the quiet, graceful, childlike dependence on Charlie and others for all its wants, was most engaging. o o o At night-time, it would lie down near the warm ashes of the fire, and rest there undisturbed till day- light. One of its first morning visits would be to some tent door, outside of which it would hop and scratch till it gained admittance. There Avas a half-bred mongrel dog, which belonged O O' o to a squatter not far off, and which had made himself notorious by doing a deal of damage amongst sheep, and a visit from this dog was much to be feared. One day, Avhilst the men were at work and out of camp, the cook and his wife heard a scuffle in one of the tents, and rushing out saw this brute of a dog shaking the young kangaroo to death. The man seized an axe and made at the dog just in time to break his hind leg with the first blow, and, as the dog turned, he dashed out"], [275, "269 VAGABOND CHARLIE. his brains with the second ; but his aid had come too late ; life in the kangaroo was not wholly extinct, but the poor thing was so mangled that the most charitable act was to put it out of its misery. All the men were desperately exasperated, though somewhat appeased to see that the dog had paid Avith his life for his intrusion. Opossums and flying squirrels were also pets of Charlie and the men, of these latter they had quite a little family, and it was a pretty sight to see them half-flying, half-leaping, from rafter to raster of the large cook-house that formed the general dining saloon. or mess-hut. They would roani about by day in the trees near by, and at night seek the shelter of the tents for warmth and comfort. Like most pets, they all came to grief in their time ; some by accident, such as being trodden upon in the dark, or eating something not suitable to their diges tions. Others strayed away as they grew older ; nor, indeed, was this much to be wondered at, considering the numbers of their fellows which inhabited the neighbouring bush. O O On moonlight nights they would come out of their holes, and squat about the trees by the dozen ; and it was easy to count upon one tree as many as fifteen or twenty. At first the men shot them or knocked them over with sticks, but they were so tenacious of life, and looked so piteously on their destroyers, that no one felt inclined to continue their slaughter. Properly to cure the skin took more time than they could devote to it, and the flesh was not sufficiently"], [276, "270 ArAGAB0ND CHARLIE. tempting to cook it up as a dainty; so they were left in peace to enjoy their freedom. It was a great place for cockatoos, and once, when Charlie was out shooting, he heard in the distance an extraordinary noise, the like of which he had never heard before. Following the souud, he came upon a circular opening surrounded by tall trees. In the open and upon the trees was a perfect swarm of \"white cock atoos.\" He had many a time at home seen one, and perhaps two fields, covered with rooks, and had been struck by the intelligent way they talked to each other, and gave warning of approaching danger. Here was much the same sight ; only the number of birds being multiplied a hundredfold, and then being all white, produced a most curious effect. In their short flights from tree to tree, and to and from the ground, their numbers were so countless that it looked, for all the world, like a living snowstorm or whirlwind of snowflakes. As Chariie passed under the trees there was shed around a peculiar, soft, delicate haze of light, re sembling what may be often noticed beneath the canopy of a cherry-tree laden with blossoms. The scene was most enchanting, and would have been completely fairy- like, except for the harsh, dis cordant noise these beautiful birds created. Charlie was far too much fascinated to dream of firinor a shot. O ' or in any Avay disturbing their peaceful gathering."], [277, "VAGABOND CHAELIE. 271 CHAPTER XXIX. Edwards had purchased forty acres of land in a well to-do district, and with the large gang of men at his disposal, he calculated he should make it pay hand somely if he could get in some wheat, and other cereals early in the season. For this purpose Charlie moved his camp and settled in a most picturesque spot, immediately in the vicinity of Edwards' house, which was situated on a rising ground, and commanded an extensive view over a marvellously pretty country. It made Charlie a little envious as he looked over this, and fancied what a lovely homestead it would become; and he almost thought that here he could live with any one of the fair ones who had passed him by, or whom prudence had dictated to him it would be better to resign. The business of land-clearing went on rapidly, and Charlie was as much one of the men now as ever; he had no especial duty as manager, the whole work was so immediately under the eye of Edwards that he took his turn with the rest at manual labour. In less than a month they had cleared, broken up, and planted ten acres with wheat ; and under the energetic superintendence of Edwards and the kindly smiles of his wife, other operations followed in quick succession. Charlie spent part of every evening with the Edwards', and his Sundays were truly happy days of rest and quiet enjoyment. Mrs. Edwards endeared"], [278, "272 VAGABOND CHARLIE. herself to all by her kind thoughtfulness for every one, and many a blessing was daily showered upon her head, as she passed by or conversed with the men. Charlie had just the satisfaction of seeing the newly planted land green with its maiden crop, when a summons came which put an abrupt termination to his Australian wanderings. On and after the receipt of Charlie's first letter home, his father had wisely concluded that the style of life this and his subsequent letters depicted, was not one likely to lead to ultimate prosperity. Immediately on the outbreak of the Crimean war, he set his interest to work to get Charlie a commission in the army ; and he was promised that if his son appeared in England by a given time and passed his examination, he should get his commission. It was on a Sunday morning, when he had cleaned himself for the day and, as his custom was, made his way to Edwards' house, that he there found a letter from home. Its purport was, that if he was doing well, and really saw a prospect of rising and getting on, he must stay in Australia ; on the other hand, if he was onlv living, as it appeared by his letters, a careless and laborious existence, he had better take the first ship, come home, and turn soldier. He was then, and had been for months past, in receipt of fifteen shillings a day, and all found ; this was equivalent to at least a pound a day, and it became quite a matter of considera tion whether he should throw this up or not. Had he been at all circumspect, he might have laid by a con-"], [279, "273 VAGABOND CHARLIE. siderable sum; as the case stood, he had hardly twenty pounds he could call his own. A long consultation with Edwards decided him to accept his father's offer, and to go home at once. Perhaps what most weighed with him, was a small delicately-written enclosure, penned by the hand of one whom he had never completely forgotten, and visions of whom had often and often flitted before him in his dreams, and had been the companion of many a waking thought. O O They arranged that he should leave early on Monday morning, and should go to his cousin in Melbourne, to whom his father had also written to supply him with money for his journey home, and other wants. Accordingly, next day Charlie packed up his traps, and bid farewell to all. It was a parting by no means unfelt or devoid of expression on either side ; the soldier became quite eloquent and pathetic in his demonstrations of regret. The Melbourne steam boat was almost hourly ex pected, so that Charlie had not much time for reflection. The old hotel in town had changed hands, and he learnt that Richards, whose presence he missed, was acting as common ostler at a public-house twelve miles out of tOWD. Determined to say good-bye to his old friend, he borrowed a horse and rode out. He reached the public just at dinner-time, and found Richards eating a solitary meal in a miserable hut attached to the stables, and heard with pain how it was he had arrived at his present reduced circumstances. He was now in a F 18"], [280, "274 VAGABOND CHARLIE. very different and inferior position to the one he held in town, when Charlie went up country. A hasty half-hour was all the time Charlie could spare, and during this he learnt more of Richard's antecedents than ever he knew before. Curiously enough, it turned out that Richards' father had been one of Charlie's senior officers in the navy, and was personally known to him. This knowledge seemed to make their separation doubly trying ; and Richards begged him to write to, or see his friends, directly he reached England, and entreat them to send out enough money to take him home. This, of course, Charlie readily consented to do, and a few months afterwards had the gratification of per forming. It was sad work leaving the poor fellow in such a wretched plight, whilst he was himself going oft' full of the brightest hopes for his own future. His cousin in Melbourne was quite ready to receive him, and knowing the captain of a fine ship which would sail in a week, he advised him to secure a second class cabin in this vessel. Charlie first tried to work his passage home, but no captain would listen to his proposal, as hundreds were trying to do the same thing. They could get as many able seamen as they required, and were taking home almost as many passengers as they brought out. Mel bourne was over-stocked with labour of all kinds, and in place of the abounding wealth and reckless method of living Charlie had witnessed three years back, he now met with many outward signs of poverty and distress ; there were actual beggars in the"], [281, "275 VAGABOND CHARLIE. streets, very much the same as in any populous city at home. The population, or rather immigration, had increased to such an extent that the market was glutted with everything in the way of clothes and other dry goods ; whilst the bare necessities of life were at ruinous prices, and many hundreds and thousands were little more than half fed and badly housed ; all this fully satisfied Charlie that he was making his exodus none too soon. The ship he came home in was well laden with passengers, and there were very few vacant berths in either the second or third class cabins. The early part of the voyage was one of unusual rapidity. A strong fair wind carried them safely round the dreaded \" Horn,\" and rendered those rough waters comparatively smooth. To those who, like Charlie, knew their danger, the running for four days through fields of ice and loose bergs, at the rate of ten, twelve, and fourteen knots, was a situation by no means assuring. One night a serious alarm was raised, and it required all the coolness and determination of the captain and crew to avoid a deplorable disaster. The ship was running at the rate of fourteen knots, when one of the watch called out, \" Ice on the starboard bow !\" An immense towering bei-g was visible, standing right across her bows ; and she appeared to be dashing stem on to this mountain of ice. A complete panic seized upon the passengers. Those on deck called down the hatchways for all hands to turn out ; and men, women, and children, rushed with 18\u20142"], [282, "276 VAGABOND CHARLIE. dismay from their beds into the cold freezing night, with little or nothing upon them. Charlie was aroused by his companions, with the cry of \"The ship is on the ice, and going down,\" and with screams of women and children, mingled with the shouts and cries of the men. Above all was heard the voice of the captain loudly, yet calmly and coolly, giving his orders, as if he was merely exercising his ship at a review. When Charlie was called upon to bestir himself, it was so awfully cold that all he said was, \" If the ship goes down, where is the use of rushing on deck to be frozen? Better go down comfortably in one's blanket ;\" and he refused to move. For twenty or thirty minutes the excitement and fear was extreme. All on deck could plainly see, and, more acutely, feel, a huge barrier of ice, as it were towering above their heads, from which appeared no way of escape, and a total wreck was momentarily expected. Fortunately the ship was well officered, and beauti fully handled ; being in excellent sailing trim, she answered readily to the helm, came up head to wind as smart as any racing yacht, and remained almost stationary, whilst the great berg floated harmlessly astern, as some said, within a stone's throw. Every one looked upon their escape as next door to miraculous ; the sudden revulsion of feeling from fear to joy for a time paralysed the whole ship's company, a death-like stillness prevailed as each mentally mea sured the distance from the ship to the berg, and thought of the danger so happily averted."], [283, "277 VAGABOND CHARLIE. Again the ship was put before the wind and con tinued her rapid course; by daybreak all hands were gladdened with the knowledge that they had left the icy regions far behind them. Amongst the landsmen and the would-be nautically wise ones, for several days the question was mooted and discussed, as to how far it was wise to sail at such a rate amongst the ice ; and O ' the captain came in for no small amount of censure from these \" Solons,\" though all admitted that his admirable seamanship and self-possession, had certainly saved them from a watery grave. The probability was that they were not so near the iceberg as they fancied. The rarity of the atmosphere and the intense cold that surrounds a large berg, make it both look and feel very much nearer than it really is ; add to this the time, which was night, as well as the fact that two-thirds of an iceberg must necessarily be under water, and the result would be that, although they appeared on the point of destruction, there remained, as it proved, sea-room enough to avoid a collision. Forty days out from Melbourne they crossed the \"line,\" and bets were freely made about reaching England in fifty-two days, but here hope was dis appointed. Fourteen days' dead calm upset all calculations, and it was not till the sixty-eighth day that they sighted the \" Land's-end.\" O Off Falmouth a pilot-boat came alongside, and Charlie, with four more passengers, availed themselves of this chance of landing, and heartily gave three cheers as they shoved off from the ship's side, on board of which they had spent so many weary days."], [284, "278 VAGABOND CHARLIE. Little more need be said, than that two days sufficed to land Charlie once more safely by his home fireside, and in the loving embrace of his father and mother. O The first excitement of greeting being over, his father said \u2014 \" Well, my boy, what have you done and what have you learnt by your three years' absence V \" I have done little, but I have learnt this much,\" said Charlie, \"that Shakespeare was right when he said or wrote : \" ' This above all \u2014 to thine own self be true, And it m ust follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man.' \" THE END.
