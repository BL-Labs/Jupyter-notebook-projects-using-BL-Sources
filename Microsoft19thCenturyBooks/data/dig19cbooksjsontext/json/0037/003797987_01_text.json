It certainly was as miserable a specimen of the canine race as could well be seen ; mangy, blear-eyed, dragging its hind-legs after it as if paralyzed, a mere bag of bones, evidently in the last stage of the distemper. But that was no reason, at least so thought little Nelly Thorpe, why its last moments should be rendered still more wretched by insult and persecution. It was in a narrow lane near the village of Longwater, in the Lake district, that she fell in with the object of her commiseration, just as it crawled into a ditch, in the vain hope of VOL. i. b"], [10, "2 ON THE BRINK. finding a place of refuge from half-a-dozen young ragamuffins, who were bent upon tying a tin can to its tail. Without a moment's thought she threw herself into the ditch beside it, covering it with her cloak, and doing her best to protect it from the assaults of its enemies, who by this time had reached the spot, and were rather gratified than otherwise by finding two victims instead of one. As there was some difficulty in getting at the original object of their pursuit, they attached themselves to its protectress, and by tugging at her dress endeavoured to remove the obstacle which stood between them and their prey. One impudent urchin, the leader of the band, had actually laid hold of Nelly's hair, which luckily for her was cut very close, when just in the nick of time a champion and avenger appeared upon the scene. A young man, some seventeen or eighteen years of age, came sauntering down the lane, with a book in one hand, a switch in the other, and a cigar in his mouth. When the noise of the affray"], [11, "ON THE BRINK. 3 reached his ears he looked up, and hurrying on, administered such a sharp cut on that part of the principal delinquent's person which is appointed by Nature for the reception of such favours, that the culprit jumped up with a yell, and grasping the part affected with his hand, ran off as fast as his short legs would carry him . The others, seeing the discomfiture of their chieftain, followed his example, and bolting through a gap in the hedge, were soon out of sight. \" Oh, sir, do you think it will die ?\" were Nelly's first words, looking up at her deliverer with a pair of large hazel eyes. \" My dear child, I hope those young black guards have not hurt you. What was it all about ?\" \" They did not hurt me much, but do you think it will die ?\" Mr. Arthur Compton, for so the young gentleman was named, now perceived for the first time the object of her anxiety lying at the bottom of the ditch. Being very good-"], [12, "4 ON THE BRINK. natured, and moreover attracted by the child, who seemed to have lost all recollection of the rough assaults to which she had been exposed in her solicitude for a miserable brute dying by the roadside, he also entered the ditch, and began his examination. \"I should say it is dying now,\" he said, when this was completed. \" Oh, sir, can we not save it ?\" she replied, now secure of his sympathy. \" The best thing to do for it would be to knock it on the head, and put it out of its misery.\" \" Oh, please sir, don't. It licked my hand.\" And to enforce her entreaty she caught hold of his sleeve. \" What is your name, my dear ?\" \" Nelly, sir ; but can we save it ?\" \" Well, we will try, at all events. I will take him home, and do my best for him.\" And so saying, he produced his handkerchief, laid it on the ground, placed the dog, which seemed to be a rough terrier puppy, upon it, and knotting up the corners, started on his"], [13, "ON THE BRINK. way home, accompanied by Nelly, trotting beside him. They soon fell into conversation, and Compton found out that his companion, who was about ten or eleven years old, had been living for some years, in fact ever since she could remember, with an aunt, Mrs. Elizabeth Thorpe by name, in a pretty-looking house, half-villa, half-cottage, a few hundred yards from the village. Nelly had been on some charitable errand to one of their pensioners, and was on her return home, when she had been so rudely assailed and so opportunely rescued. \" Where do you mean to take him, sir ?\" asked Nelly, lifting up a corner of the handkerchief, and taking a peep at the patient. \" I was thinking of taking him home with me to William Bacon's, just on the other side of the tarn. Unless you would like me to take him to your house.\" \" Oh no, sir. Auntie would not let me have a dog. But are you the gentleman who is lodging at Mr. Bacon's ?\""], [14, "ON THE BRINK. 6 \"I am the very man ; Arthur Compton, at your service.\" \" Oh, I am so glad. We get all our butter and milk from him.\" With this sort of prattle they arrived at the farm-house, where a hamper filled with hay was procured, and placed in an outhouse, and in this the dog was laid. Mrs. Bacon, with whom Miss Nelly seemed to be a favourite, warmed a httle milk, which the starving beast lapped up, almost as much to the young lady's satisfaction as his own. \"Well, Nelly,\" said Compton, \"I really think he may get through. He is certainly all the better for the milk, and to-morrow I will go over to Ambleside and get some medicine for him. He would not be such a bad-looking brute if he had a little more flesh on his bones.\" Nelly actually coloured with pleasure as these hopeful words fell upon her ears. \" And may I come to-morrow, sir, to see how he is ?\" she said. \" Pray do. Come whenever you like. If I"], [15, "ON THE BRINK. 7 am in, I shall be delighted to see you, and if I am out, the dog will ; at least, if he has a spark of gratitude, for if he lives, he will certainly owe his life to you. And now let me take you home, for it is getting late, and it will soon be dark.\" She was half inclined to tell him that it was quite unnecessary, and that she could find her way blindfold, but she had a great deal more to say, a great many more questions to ask, and she was unwilling to lose so good an op portunity. With the confidence of childhood she put her hand into that of her new friend, and went skipping and chattering by his side till they reached her aunt's abode. Here she found herself in a state of great embarrass ment. She had always heard the clergy man, or the doctor, or any other of their not very numerous acquaintance, courteously in vited to enter the house when they ac companied her aunt to the door, and she was debating within herself whether she could venture to follow the hospitable example."], [16, "ON THE BRINK. 8 She had not yet settled the point when Comp ton settled it for her. As soon as he saw her through the garden wicket he wished her good night. \"I shall not go to Ambleside,\" he said, \" till the afternoon. So if you like to come and look after your friend before that, you will find me too. And if he lives, and we are to keep him, you ought to think of a name to give him.\" Miss Nelly kept the appointment. She made her appearance at Mr. Bacon's farm soon after breakfast, and came not alone. Her aunt, to whom she had of course related all the adventures of the preceding evening, ac companied her, for the purpose of thanking Mr. Compton for the service he had rendered her niece, and perhaps a little anxious to ascertain by personal inspection that he was not an ogre in the garb of a knight-errant, or a wolf in sheep's clothing, lying in wait to gobble up her little Red Riding Hood. If such were her thoughts, she was most agreeably- undeceived. She found a young"], [17, "ON THE BRINK. 9 man, not only with the manners of a gentle man, such as may be acquired by education and habitual contact with good society, but with that air of high-born refinement for which the mere parvenu may sigh in vain. Compton was somewhat above the middle size, with a slight but well-proportioned figure, which gave promise rather of activity and powers of endurance than of great muscular strength. Without a single feature that could be called regularly handsome, there was a very attractive expression thrown over the whole, and his smile was particularly winning. The only thing that seemed the least suspicious was the appearance of a number of books in strange necromantic-looking characters, strewn about the room in every direction. Altogether, he made a very favourable impres sion on Mrs. Thorpe, who, after explaining her errand, and giving him the thanks that were his due, soon slid into easy conversation with him. \"I quite scolded Nelly,\" she said, \"for not bringing you in to have some tea with us ; but"], [18, "ON THE BRINK. 10 I hope, now that you know the way to our cottage, you will come whenever it suits you. Not that you will find much to amuse you. We are very regular, quiet people, and are alone six evenings out of the seven. Are you making a long stay in this part of the world ?\" \" No, indeed,\" he replied. \" I may be sum moned away at any moment. I have the promise of a cadetship in India, and only came here to while away the time, and to study some of the eastern languages in peace and quiet. Your invitation is most welcome to me, for I do not know a soul to speak to here, and I sometimes get heartily tired of my own society.\" \" I am afraid,\" said Mrs. Thorpe, \" you will not find much variety in the conversation of an old woman and a little girl, but such as it is you will always be welcome to it.\" Mrs. Thorpe\u2014 Mrs. by brevet only\u2014 did herself great injustice in styling herself an old woman. She was but little past forty, and did not look her age. While this conversation had been goino* on"], [19, "ON THE BRINK. 11 Miss Nelly had been to visit her protege. \" Oh sir,\" she said, on her return to Compton's sitting-room, \"he knew me quite well, and wagged his tail. And Mrs. Bacon thinks he will live.\" \" Yes, he certainly is much better, thanks to you. What is he to be called ?\" This was a point which had kept her awake for a long time on the preceding night, and naturally she had pitched upon the most in appropriate name possible. \" Do you think Leo a good name, sir ?\" she asked, rather anxiously. \" I think it a capital name. He does not look much like a lion now, certainly, but there is no saying what he may turn out.\" Mrs. Thorpe rose to depart. \"Will you come to us this evening, Mr. Compton ?\" she said. \" With pleasure. But will you confer a still greater favour on me? I am going to Ambleside this afternoon, to get some physic for Leo. Will you allow your niece to go"], [20, "ON THE BRINK. 12 with me ? I promise to take the greatest care of her, and will bring her back safe, and in time for tea.\" Mrs. Thorpe reflected for a moment. \" What do you say, Nelly ; should you like to go?\" \" Oh yes, Auntie ; so much !\" *t \" In that case, Mr. Compton, if you will call for her about three o'clock, she shall be ready for you. We dine at two.\" \" We all dine at two, here, I think,\" said Compton. \" At least, I do. At the appointed hour Nelly was ready, dressed in her best, to do honour to her new friend. She was perhaps a little too short and a little too thick for her age, but for all that, though not pretty, there was something very pleasing in her appearance, and so Comp ton thought as she stood waiting for him at the open window, in her little straw hat, and her features beaming with anticipated pleasure. The walk was a very successful one. Leo's medicine was bought with very precise instruc-"], [21, "ON THE BRINK. 13 tions for its use, and carefully deposited in a little basket which Nelly had brought with her for that purpose. \" Shall we give him some to-night, sir ?\" she asked. \" Yes, if it will not tire you to go round by my house. But it must be upon one condition ; you are not to call me sir, any more. You must call me Arthur.\" The acquaintance thus begun between Compton and the Thorpes soon ripened into friendship. Every morning Nelly went to pay a visit to her two friends, Arthur and Leo, and every evening Compton passed at Mrs. Thorpe's cottage. That good lady soon found herself taking almost a maternal interest in her visitor, and before long dropt into the habit of calling him Arthur herself. His history was a very simple one, and soon told. His mother had died many years before, in giving birth to a daughter, who followed her before she had attained her tenth year. His father, Captain Compton, had also died in the preceding year, leaving Arthur, as his sole inheritance, an un-"], [22, "ON THE BRINK. 14 tarnished name and about a couple of thousand pounds. But on his deathbed he recommended his son in the strongest terms to Sir Ralph Compton, the head of his family, and no very distant relation, with whom, in the days of his youth, he had been on habits of intimacy. Sir Ralph acknowledged the claim thus made upon him, to the extent of introducing his cousin to a friend of his, one of the directors of the East India Company, who promised him the first vacant cadetship that he had to dis pose of. Nothing could have been more agreeable to Arthur Compton, whose aspira tions were all for a military life, and whose good sense pointed out to him that in the Com pany's service there were prospects of rapid advancement, which the regular army does not hold out to men without money or powerful interest to back them. His father had served with distinction for thirty years in every part of the world, and died a captain on half pay. All this Compton related to his new friends"], [23, "ON THE BRINK. 15 with the utmost unreserve. There was no reason why he should not. But Mrs. Thorpe was not so communicative with respect to her self and her niece, and she frankly confessed that there were circumstances connected with her niece's history which she was not at liberty to relate. \" All I can tell you,\" she said, \" is that her mother is dead, her father is still alive, and for family reasons has given her up entirely to my care, after settling ten thousand pounds upon her. As regards money, therefore, she will do very well, but in every other respect the poor child is much to be pitied. Of course you will not make her position a subject of conversation with her.\" \" Certainly not ; but you must allow me to say, that I cannot think her such an object of pity when she has an aunt like you to take care of her.\" \" Yery prettily said, Mr. Arthur ; but you ought to be ashamed of yourself for trying to get round an old woman in that way.\" \"So I shall be, whenever I do try to get"], [24, "16 ON THE BRINK. round an old woman, which is not the case at present.\" Their hours were not all spent in idleness. It cannot be said that Nelly's education had been neglected, for her aunt had taught her all she knew herself; but this was comprised in reading, writing, and the four first rules of arithmetic, to which may be added needle work in all its domestic branches. Compton proposed to give her lessons in French and drawing, an offer which was gratefully accepted. The hours which Nelly spent every morn ing with her friend were devoted to instruction, and so able was the master, so zealous the pupil, that during the remainder of Compton's stay, which lasted longer than he had expected, she made great progress. \" How we shall miss you when you go !\" said Mrs. Thorpe, one evening. \"Dear Auntie,\" Compton replied, \"do not think the loss will be on your side only. Till I knew you and Nelly I could have left Eng land without regret, for I do not believe there"], [25, "ON THE BRINK. 17 is another person who cares if I live or die, unless indeed it be my cousin, Philip Compton, Sir Ralph's grandson and heir.

I received a letter this morning desiring me to present myself at the India House on Wed nesday next. And this is Friday. Monday will be my last day here, I fear.\" \" Oh, Arthur, must you go so soon ?\" sobbed out poor little Nelly, when her aunt had left the room. \" Why must you go at all? Why can't you always remain here ?\" \" Because, my love, I should starve. I have not money enough to live in England.\" \" But Auntie has. She will let you come and live with us. She loves you so.\" c VOL. I."], [26, "ON THE BRINK. 18 \"No, Nelly, it cannot be. And it is not only money I think of. No man ought to pass his life in idleness, and I want to do something to make you proud of your brother Arthur.\" \" I do not want to be proud of you. I only want to love you, and you to love me. You will forget us when you are so far away.\" \" Dearest Nelly, do not be afraid of my ever forgetting my little sister. And after all, I am not going away for ever. I shall come back to you and Auntie, and in the meantime you must write to me.\" \"Oh yes. And what will you do with Leo ?\" \" I have thought of him too. He has turned out so handsome, that I was not ashamed to ask my cousin Philip to take charge of him for me, and he promised to do so at once. You need not be uneasy about him ; he will be w-ell cared for.\" \" Oh, if Auntie would but let me keep him !\" Compton said nothing in answer to this"], [27, "ON THE BRINK. 19 exclamation, but when Mrs. Thorpe returned, and Nelly was sent off to bed, he determined to see what he could do, and asked Auntie, in his most insinuating manner, to take care of Leo for him. \" No, Arthur, you must not ask that. I should like to have the dog well enough for my own part, but for Nelly's sake I must re fuse. She had a canary bird, which died last year, and I really thought she would have cried herself into fits. I made a vow I would never allow her to have another pet. Her attachments are so passionate, poor child ; perhaps from having so few to love. I cannot tell you with what dread I look forward to your departure.\" \" I will use all my influence to induce her to look upon it as a necessary evil ; an evil which I trust will lead to good.\" \"Do, I entreat of you; perhaps she will listen to you on such a subject better than she would to me. And now, my dear Arthur, do not think me impertinent, but I know young"], [28, "ON THE BRINK. 20 men sometimes have debts which they cannot pay upon the spur of the moment, and if a hundred pounds are of any use \" \" Dear Mrs. Thorpe,\" said Arthur, interrupt ing her, \" I do not owe a shilling in the world except a week's bill to Mrs. Bacon, and Sir Ralph has promised to give me my outfit. I shall leave England with my two thousand pounds untouched. But do not think me the less grateful for your intended kindness. I hardly know whether I ought to rejoice or grieve at the chance which has given me such friends, when I think of the pain which our separation will entail upon all of us.\" \"My clear Arthur, never regret having made a friend. I trust, when we say farewell, it will not be for ever. Why, even I look forward to welcoming Colonel Compton on his return from India.\" \" Thank you, Auntie,\" said Compton, laugh ing. \" I accept your words as a favourable omen for my success in life. And now will you allow me in turn to say something that"], [29, "ON THE BRINK. 21 appears to me to be of importance to your niece ?\" Mrs. Thorpe made a gesture of assent. \" Well, then. But first I must say that I should not venture upon it, had you not given me reason to suppose that you have money at your command. That being so, surely you ought to give Nelly a better education than she can get here. If you have an objec tion to London, at least take her for a few months to Liverpool, or better still, to Edin burgh, where she could find excellent masters. She has great abilities, and an earnest desire to make the most of them ; and, without seeking to pry into her history, I feel sure that it can not be intended that she should pass her life in these wilds.\" \" I too have thought of all this,\" Mrs. Thorpe replied, after a short silence. \" You are right ; Nelly's education must no longer be neglected, as my own was. We will pass the next winter in Edinburgh. And believe me, when I am allowed to clear up what appears to be"], [30, "ON THE BRINK. 22 mysterious in her position, you shall be the first to be informed of it. At present I am bound to silence, and let me entreat you to mention to no one that you have made our acquaintance.\" The day of parting came, and a bitter parting it was on all sides. Compton wrote twice, and received answers to both letters before he sailed, and for a couple of years the corre spondence was continued. But at length it ceased altogether. The last letter Compton received from Nelly was to thank him for one of those wonderful inlaid Indian boxes which he had sent her. His two next letters remained unnoticed, or at all events, if answers were written, they never reached him. It gave him a severe pang when he was obliged to confess to himself that the intercourse on which he set so much value was thus suddenly broken off. He would not believe that the silence of Nelly and her aunt was owing to any change of feel ing on their part, but, attributing it to acci dental circumstances, looked forward with con-"], [31, "ON THE BRINK. 23 fidence to a renewal of their intimacy on his return to England. This return was long delayed, and it was not till after the quelling of the Indian Mutiny that Arthur Compton returned to his native land, after an absence of more than twelve years."], [32, "ON THE BRINK. 24 CHAPTER II. A large party was assembled at a villa on the banks of the Thames in the outskirts of Twickenham. The invitations had been given for a dejeuner dansant, but the heat of that month of June was so overpowering, that none but the most fanatical enthusiasts thought of putting in requisition the services of the band which had been provided for their amusement. The rest of the company had broken up into groups, and were lounging about the beautiful gardens and grounds, or indolently reclining beneath the deep shade of some magnificent oaks which stretched their spreading arms far over the water."], [33, "ON THE BRINK. 25 The presiding genius in one of these groups was a lady in the first bloom of youth and beauty, who, from the attention and devotion of which she was the object, appeared to rule with absolute sway over the devotees by whom she was surrounded. Perhaps this was owing in a great measure to the impartiality with which she distributed her smiles and remarks to all those who composed her court. Where no marked preference was shown, every man felt that his own chance of notice was as good as his neighbour's ; and every woman saw at a glance that in all she said and did Lady Tenby had no covert designs upon the hearts of any of their admirers ; that her very innocent and transparent coquetries had no worse motive than the fair and legitimate one of a general desire to please. Thus, if she was the object of male adoration, she made no enemies amongst those of her own sex. The laughter and animation which pervaded the circle of which she was the centre formed rather a marked contrast with the silence and"], [34, "ON THE BRINK. 26 listlessness observable in some of the coteries near her, and by degrees she annexed many of the subjects of other potentates. It was not that the conversation was particularly well worth listening to, but the various topics which followed each other in rapid succession were interesting to the auditors; they were discussed with wit and spirit, and this was sufficient to attract attention. In the midst of some playful remark of Lady Tenby's, a puff of wind caught hold of her parasol, which lay open on the ground before her, and wafted it into an adjacent meadow, notwithstanding a score of hands stretched out to arrest its flight. \" Oh, my parasol !\" she exclaimed. \" Who will fetch it for me ? Lord Edward, you who are so active, I appeal to you.\" Lord Edward looked at the sunk fence with a wooden rail on the top of it, which separated the lawn on which they were sitting from the field. \" The fence,\" he said, \" is nothing to get over from this side, but I do not exactly see how I am to get back, without going miles"], [35, "ON THE BRINK 27 round by the road. Moreover, the meadow is a perfect quagmire, and I should be up to my knees in mud, quite unfit to dance with you after breakfast, as I hope to have the honour of doing.\" \" And in the mean time I must lose my poor parasol! Now, if none of you are gallant enough to get it for me without a reward, a reward I will offer. I mean to have one waltz after breakfast, one only ; and my partner shall be the champion who restores to me my parasol.\" Several there were who approached the fence and looked at it, but they all seemed to think Lord Edward's objections well founded. And a still more formidable obstacle presented itself, in the shape of a herd of wild-looking cattle, who, flourishing their tails in the air, had galloped and floundered up to some rushes by which the flight of the parasol had been arrested, and were evidently eyeing the intrusive object with great suspicion. A short silence ensued. At length Lord"], [36, "28 ON THE BRINK. Edward said, \" I will go up to the house, Lady Tenby, and tell one of the servants to go round and fetch it for you.\" He turned round, and had made a few steps when he was recalled. \" Stop, Lord Edward,\" she cried. \" Never mind the parasol now, and instead of going for a servant, tell Colonel Compton I wish to speak to him.\" \" Colonel Compton ! Who on earth is Colonel Compton ?\" \" What a question ! I should have thought every one who has read the newspapers for the last two or three years must have known who Colonel Compton is.\" \" What, do you mean the Colonel Compton of Kara and Delhi ?\" \" Precisely. That is he standing under the lime-tree, talking to Sir Philip Compton. Do tell him I wish to speak to him.\" Lord Edward departed on his mission, followed by every eye. Colonel Compton, but just returned from India, was as yet unknown to London society ; but there were few who"], [37, "ON THE BRINK. 29 were not aware that amongst hundreds of brave men he had made himself conspicuous by deeds of the most desperate valour and daring which would have become a knight of the olden time . that more than once, when in separate com mand, his military- skill and judgment had deserved and obtained the eulogy of his chiefs. He had been one of the first to receive the Yictoria cross, and at little more than thirty years of age was already considered as one of the most distinguished officers in the service. It is not surprising therefore that the mention of his name excited considerable curiosity. \" What on earth can Lady Tenby want with him ?\" whispered Mr. Cooper to his neighbour. \"She can never mean to send such a man as that after her parasol.\" The lady to whom this observation was addressed contented herself with shrugging her shoulders ; but they were not long kept in suspense. When Lord Edward accosted Compton, the colonel was alone, and, to say truth, looking considerably bored. His cousin,"], [38, "ON THE BRINK. 30 under whose auspices he had made his appear ance at the breakfast, had just left him to join some ladies ; he knew no one to speak to, and he was revolving in his own mind the best way of making his escape from a scene in which he took so little interest, when Lady Tenby's ambassador, in courteous tone, though he did not much like the mission, asked if he had the honour of speaking to Colonel Compton. Receiving an answer in the affirmative, he continued, \" In that case I am instructed by Lady Tenby to say that she wishes to speak to you.\" \" To me !\" replied the colonel. \" Surely you must be under some mistake. I have not the pleasure of knowing Lady Tenby, even by sight.\" \"No; no mistake at all. If you do not know Lady Tenby by sight, she knows you, for she pointed you out to me, and desired me to bring you to her. So take my advice, and come back with me. She is worth knowing, if even only by sight.\""], [39, "ON THE BRINK. 31 Compton complied, and in another minute found himself the centre of a group of persons utterly unknown to him, and the object of general observation. \"Lady Tenby,\" said Lord Edward, \" I have been fortunate enough to execute your commission with perfect success, and bring you another captive.\" For a minute Lady Tenby was silent, and looked so earnestly at the colonel that he blushed to the roots of his hair. He was a very shy man, and he began to feel consider able embarrassment. To escape from it he said, \" Will you allow me to ask your lady ship with what commands you are pleased to honour me ?\" The sound of his voice seemed to dispel Lady Tenby's reverie. She coloured as deeply as himself. \" I am almost afraid to tell you,\" she said ; \" for now that it is too late, my mind misgives me, and I fear that you will think I have taken an inexcusable liberty.\" The tone in which she spoke had something"], [40, "ON THE BRINK. 32 in it so timid and beseeching, that Compton exclaimed, \" Oh, if that is your only fear, Lady Tenby, I entreat of you to cast it aside at once. I shall be happy and proud to do any thing in my power to serve you.\" \"Well then,\" she replied, speaking very quickly and with a forced laugh, \" the fact is, my parasol has been blown into the next field ; these gentlemen are all too much afraid of dirtying their shoes to fetch it for me, and in my distress I bethought me of Colonel Compton, of whose good nature I had heard much. Will you assist a poor forlorn woman in her utmost need ?\" For a moment Compton stood irresolute. Again the colour rushed to his cheeks, but this time in displeasure. It seemed to him that he had been brought out to make sport for the Philistines, and something like a frown was beginning to gather on his brow. But before it had time to settle there he recovered himself. He felt that if the position in which he was placed was a ridiculous one, he would only"], [41, "ON THE BRINK. 33 make matters worse by taking it up seriously. The best way to bring the laugh on his side was to treat it as a joke, and enter into it. \"I am sorry, Lady Tenby,\" he said, \"that you have not imposed some more arduous task upon me as a proof of my zeal in your service.' ' With these words he sprang over the fence, and contrived to pick his way on dry spots of ground to the rushes. The cattle fled at his approach ; he picked up the parasol, and swinging himself on to a branch of an oak which hung over the meadow, he soon reached the spot where he had left Lady Tenby and her party. \" Thank you, Colonel Compton,\" she said ; \" not so much for the restoration of my parasol, as for your very good-natured com pliance with what I am sure you consider as the impertinent caprice of a silly woman. But I must not defraud you of your reward, if indeed you will consider it as such. I pro mised one waltz to any one who would recover my lost property for me, and to that you are entitled.\" Ii VOL. I,"], [42, "34 ON THE BRINK. \" I am afraid,\" he replied, \" that I must not aspire to such an honour. I am not sure that I ever knew how to waltz, but if ever I did, I am quite sure that I have forgotten all about it.\" \" In that case I think I must allow you to name a substitute.\" \"Name me,\" cried Lord Edward. \"Re member I was the first to make your acquaint- ance. \" No,\" replied Compton. \" I have no doubt I should find in you a most able representative, but I can only name to so important a trust one of my own kin. If you will permit me, Lady Tenby, I will make over my rights to Sir Philip Compton, who I know is most anxious to be presented to you.\" \"Be it so,\" said Lady Tenby. \"Bring Sir Philip to me as soon as you please. Or rather,\" she continued, rising from her seat, \" if you will give me your arm, we will go in search of him.\" He complied, and as soon as they were out"], [43, "ON THE BRINK. 35 of hearing, Lady Tenby broke silence by say ing, \"I will not offer you a penny for your thoughts, for I am certain I can guess them. You are animadverting upon the habits of women of the present day, and asking yourself if I am to be considered as a fair specimen of your countrywomen.\" \"No, indeed. I was rather wondering how I had earned the honour of being noticed by you at all.\" They walked on a few steps in silence, when Lady Tenby suddenly asked, \" Colonel Comp ton, what has become of Leo ?\" \" Leo !\" he exclaimed, in the most profound astonishment. \" Why, what can you know about Leo? Oh, Lady Tenby, do you know Nelly \u2014 Miss Thorpe, I mean. Can you give me her address ?\" \" Are you really so anxious to see her ?\" \" Am I anxious ! Why, I had not been in England eight and forty hours when I ran down to Longwater in the hope of finding some trace of her, but she and Mrs. Thorpe had left"], [44, "36 ON THE BRINK. it many years ago, and no one had the slightest idea of their present abode. In fact, there were only a very few who seemed to remember anything about them. Since then I have made every inquiry, but hitherto without success. Can you assist me ?\" \" No one. better. Nelly is my intimate friend, and is now living in my house, and, to tell you a secret, it was on her account that I was determined to make your acquaintance at the very first opportunity. After this ex planation, I hope you will forgive me for my impertinence, and if you will call on me to morrow morning you shall see Nelly herself. She has not forgotten her brother Arthur.\" \" Dear little Nelly ! And Mrs. Thorpe ; I hope she is alive and well.\" \"Yes, she is alive and well, but she has been nearly blind for many years. She can find her way about the house, but she cannot see to write, or, indeed, to read much.\" \"How grieved I am to hear it! Nothing can ever make me forget the more than kind-"], [45, "ON THE BRINK. 37 ness which I received from her. Does not her niece live with her still ?\" \" No. Mrs. Thorpe lives in a small house of her own, and her niece lives in mine, as I mentioned to you. But they meet almost every day. Nelly knows how much she owes to her aunt, and is not ungrateful.\" \" And how has she turned out ? Nelly, I mean. She had magnificent eyes, but beyond that I do not think she gave much promise of beauty.\" \" I will tell you nothing about her. You must judge for yourself. Of course, after so many years, you must be prepared to find her much changed. Little Nelly is now a woman, and I do not suppose that you would know her again.\" \" Not know her ! Oh, Lady Tenby, she must be changed indeed, if I fail to recognize her.\" \" We shall see to-morrow. Is not that your cousin? Suppose you call him, and prepare him for the happiness in store for him.\" Sir Philip had been watching their approach"], [46, "ON THE BRINK. 38 with some curiosity. His surprise was great at seeing his cousin on such apparently inti mate terms with one, whose exclusiveness was supposed to be quite on a par with her beauty. Perhaps he was a little disgusted at seeing that another less known than himself had already established himself on a familiar footing, where he had been man\u0153uvring in vain for some time to obtain an introduction. With both it was their first London season, for Sir Ralph Compton had only been dead a few months, and for some years previous to that event Philip had been serving with his regiment in different parts of the world. Sir Ralph, who was himself a general officer, and had gone through the whole of the Peninsular war, wind ing up his military career at Waterloo, had offered no very strong opposition to his grand son's entreaties to be allowed to enter the army, but he only gave his consent on condition of its being adopted as a profession, not as a pastime. The consequence was that Philip obtained a commission in the regiment of the"], [47, "ON THE BRINK. 39 line of which his grandfather was colonel, and had been stationed first at the Cape and after wards in the Mediterranean. His rare leaves of absence had always been passed at Compton Manor. He was now on half-pay. Sir Philip's annoyance, if indeed it had ever existed, speedily vanished when, obeying a sign from the Colonel, he joined him, and was presented in due form to Lady Tenby. \" This is an honour of which I have long been desirous. How fortunate it was that I insisted upon Arthur's coming with me to-day ! I sup pose, Lady Tenby, it is quite useless to ask for a waltz after breakfast ?\" \" Quite useless. I only mean to dance one, and for that I am already engaged. At least I suppose so. I offered myself as partner to a gentleman, who not only refused me, but named a friend of his to take his place. What ought I to do ?\" \"Never speak to either of them again, of course. I think I never heard of such a piece of downright impertinence.\""], [48, "ON THE BRINK. 40 \" You hear, Colonel Compton ; your cousin decides that from this moment all intercourse between us must cease. I regret, Sir Philip, that I have made your acquaintance only to drop it again.\" \"To drop it! Why, what have we both done ?\" A long explanation and discussion ensued, which ended so far satisfactorily that Sir Philip was reinstated in his rights. He was, however, obliged to confess that in laying down general principles, he always exempted himself, by some mental process, from any application of them to his own case. Colonel Compton soon after took his leave, announcing his intention of returning by water. \" At what hour may I call upon you to-morrow, Lady Tenby?\" he asked. \" Not before twelve, but as soon as you please after that.\" \"I had no idea, Lady Tenby,\" said Sir Philip, as soon as his cousin had taken his departure, \" that Arthur had the pleasure of"], [49, "ON THE BRINK. 41 your acquaintance. He has heard me speak of you twenty times, and never once mentioned that he knew you.\" \" And that you are no doubt inclined to look upon as a high crime and misdemeanour,\" she replied. \" But you must forgive him, for to tell you the truth, I in a manner forced my acquaintance upon him an hour ago. The fact is he is an old friend of a person in whom I am much interested, and it was on her account that I sought him out.\" \"And now that you do know him, I am sure you will like him for his own sake.\" \" Is he then so much to be liked ?\" \" Liked ! I should think so,\" he exclaimed, enthusiastically. \" I have never yet met with any one who knows him who does not speak of him with regard, many with affection. Then how high he stands in his profession, entirely by his own merit ; and I am told he is adored by his men, notwithstanding that he has more than once strained their powers of endurance to the utmost. But then they know that it is never"], [50, "ON THE BRINK. 42 done wantonly or without necessity, and he never spares himself. We are all brave, it is to be hoped, more or less, but I really believe Arthur does not know what fear is. I am convinced,\" he added, with a laugh, \" that he could stand Henry the Fourth's test, and snuff a candle with his fingers without flinching.\" \" How proud you must feel of him !\" \" Yes, I do feel proud of him, or rather I feel proud of being his cousin. Of course I mean some day or other to marry, and have half-a-dozen sons, but it is a satisfaction to know that, if anything happen to me before that desirable purpose is accomplished, the honour of the Comp tons will be confided to such good hands. He is my heir, you know.\" \" No, I did not know it. I had heard that he was your cousin, but I fancied rather a distant one.\" \" Well, that is as people look at it. At all events, he is my nearest male relation on my father's side ; and it is always pleasant to feel that the ties of friendship are strengthened by"], [51, "ON THE BRINK. 43 those of blood. But really, Lady Tenby, I am ashamed of myself for taking advantage of your good-nature to inflict upon you all my family history, which cannot be very interesting to you. Will you allow me now to claim the fulfiment of your promise, or engagement, or whatever it is ? Everybody is leaving the breakfast room.\""], [52, "ON THE BRINK. 44 CHAPTER III. Comptox had no lack of matter for meditation during the remainder of that clay. That he should obtain news of Nelly, when he had almost given up in despair all hopes of ever seeing her again, was strange ; but that he should hear of her in a rank of life so far removed from that in which he had left her, was still more surprising. He was provoked with himself for not having obtained more precise information as to her present position from Lady Tenby, with whom it was evident she was on terms of great intimacy. However, there was no help for it now, and the only thing to be done was to wait with as much"], [53, "ON THE BRINK. 45 patience as he could muster for the promised interview. Lord Tenby's house was in Eaton Square, and the clock had scarcely ceased striking twelve when Compton knocked at the door. That he was expected was evident, for he had hardly mentioned his name when he was ushered upstairs. In a few minutes Lady Tenby made her appearance alone. She shook hands with her visitor, but made no allusion to Nelly. On the contrary, she seemed to have forgotten all about her, and began discussing the events of the preceding day with a vivacity and animation which at any other time Compton would have thought charming. As it was, his thoughts were elsewhere, and he answered rather absently, till she succeeded in rousing his attention by speaking of his cousin in terms of praise, in which he cordially joined. At length he could bear it no longer, and asked if Miss Thorpe was in, and if she would see him. \" True,\" said Lady Tenby, \" I forgot that"], [54, "ON THE BRINK. 46 your visit was for her, and not for me. You will see her in a few minutes, but I warn you, you will not recognize the little Nelly of Longwater. Before she makes her appearance, come and look at her portrait in the dining- room. He followed her down stairs, but amongst several portraits, the only likeness that struck him wras one of Lady Tenby herself. He paused before it for a moment. \"What an admirable likeness,\" he said, \"and as a work of art I should think a very fine painting. But where is Nelly's ?\" \" There, there, before you. Oh, Arthur ! am I then so totally grown out of your recollec tion, that you can find no trace in me of Nelly Thorpe ? I knew you at once.\" \"You, Lady Tenby! You, little Nelly!\" he exclaimed, in a tone of voice which seemed to imply that the surprise was anything but a pleasant one. \"\"No, indeed, I was not prepared for this.\" \" Arthur, Arthur, do not speak so coldly."], [55, "ON THE BRINK. 47 Oh, if you did but know how I have looked forward to this meeting, which seems to give you more pain than pleasure !\" \"No, no ; indeed you do me great injustice. But I can hardly yet realize the fact that my little sister Nelly and Lady Tenby are one and the same person.\" \"Call me your sister still. Let me still feel that I have a brother. Believe me, I need one much.\" \"I am afraid,\" he replied, with an em barrassed laugh, \" we must leave that to Lord Tenby's decision.\" \" Am I to consider that as a civil way of telling me that you reject my friendship ?\" \"Dear Lady Tenby, God is my witness that I still feel for you the same affection that I did when I left England. The greatest pain of my life was the cessation of our correspond ence ; my greatest anxiety on my return was to trace you out, and you cannot guess the pleasure, the happiness it gave me, when I found that I had the chance of seeing you"], [56, "ON THE BRINK. 48 again. I prize as it deserves the friendship you offer me. I cling to the recollections of our first acquaintance. But I must not forget that you are no longer the little girl, nor I the schoolboy, for I was not then much more, who called each other brother and sister at Longwater. You are noAV the Countess of Tenby, occupying a high position in society, and I am a mere soldier of fortune, with nothing but my profession to look to ; a profession which in all probability will oblige me to pass the greatest part of my life out of England. If you reflect for a moment on the immense social distance existing between us, I am sure you will see that it would be presump tion in me to aspire now to your intimacy. I should be quite out of place amongst your present connections and friends.\" \" Friends ! What friends ! I had thought, I had hoped to find one in you, and I meet with the indifference of a common acquaint ance.\" \" Oh, how ill you judge me, if you suppose"], [57, "ON THE BRINK 49 that anything affecting your happiness or welfare can be a matter of indifference to me. And of one thing you may be very sure, that should you at any time stand in need of my assistance, I will serve you with the devotion of a brother. You believe me, do you not ?\" \" Fully, fully ; and in you, next to God, I put my trust.\" She took his hand and pressed it. Compton looked at her anxiously. \" By-the-bye,\" he said, \" I hope you will do me the honour of introducing me to your husband.\" \" To Lord Tenby ! Oh, certainly, when he returns, which may be to-day or a month hence. He is now in Paris.\" '' In Paris ! And you here alone !'' \" Oh,\" she replied, bitterly, \" we have been married these five years ; quite long enough to be a very fashionable couple.\" They had returned to the drawing-room Compton seated himself by her side. \" Tell me all about it, Nelly,\" he said, in a tone of voice which brought the tears to her eyes. VOL. i. e"], [58, "ON THE BRINK. 50 \"No, no. I cannot, I will not. Ask Auntie. She will tell you all.\" At this moment the door opened, and a fine handsome boy, about fourteen years of age, burst into the room. \"Oh mamma,\" he ex claimed, but stopped short on seeing a stranger. \" You did not expect to find me with a son of that age,\" she said, struggling to regain her composure. '' Hugh, my dear, go and shake hands with that gentleman. He is Colonel Compton, my oldest and dearest friend ; one of whom you have often heard me speak.\" The boy did as he was told, but with seem ing reluctance. \" And now, Hugh,\" continued Lady Tenby, \" tell me what it is you want, and be quick about it, for I am busy.\" \" May I go and see the cricket-match be tween Eton and Harrow ?\" \" Certainly. Be off with you.\" Hugh kissed Lady Tenby, and departed. \" A son of Lord Tenby by a former mar riage, I presume ?\" said Compton."], [59, "ON THE BRINK. 51 \" A son of Lord Tenby, but by no marriage at all. I will tell you his history, and how I became acquainted with him ; it will serve as a sort of introduction to his father. In the autumn after I was married Lord Tenby took me down to Kilburn Lodge, a shooting-box he has on his Scotch property. During the Don caster meeting he left me there by myself for a week or ten days, and having no companion, 1 took to roaming about the country alone in all directions, much in the fashion of my Longwater days, sometimes on foot, sometimes on my pony. One day, having wandered farther from home than usual, and feeling hot and rather tired, I dismounted and knocked at the door of a farm-house, to ask for a draught of milk, and rto rest for a few minutes. A woman, the farmer's wife, came to the door, and offered to bring me some milk, but en treated me not to enter, as they had a very bad case of typhus fever in the house. I am not much afraid of infection, and thinking that perhaps I might be of some little use, I in-"], [60, "ON THE BRINK. 52 sisted. There I found this poor boy, dying, as I thought, without proper attendance, and only visited by the medical man when he could find time to ride over. The people of the house did the best they could for him, but that was not much. I had no great difficulty in finding out from them all about him. They did not know me, and they were indignant at Lord Tenby's conduct. It appears that Hugh's mother was the daughter of a minister, a Miss Graham, whom Lord Tenby seduced. What became of her no one seems to know, for she disappeared before the birth of her son. At her death, however, which occurred some ten years ago, Lord Tenby sent this boy home ; but instead of acting the part of a father to him, and giving him an education which might enable him to make his way in the world, he kept him entirely in Scotland, gave him a room over the stables, under the care of the wife of one of his helpers, and allowed him to associate on a footing of equality with the children of his grooms and gamekeepers. I"], [61, "ON THE BRINK. 53 assure you, when I made his acquaintance, he hardly knew his letters. Whenever Lord Tenby was in Scotland, the boy received the strictest injunctions to keep out of his father's presence, on pain of instant banishment ; and previous to my arrival he had been sent to this distant farm-house, although he was even then beginning to sicken. Well, when I heard all this I quite participated in the indignation of the farmer's wife, and seeing that the case was urgent, I made immediate preparations for bringing him back to Kilburn, at the risk, I must confess, of his dying on the road. There I installed him in a room next to my own, aud I really think I saved his life. My first care was to inform Lord Tenby of what I had done. I expected him to be angry, but the terms of violent reproach and ungentlemanlike abuse in which his answer was couched must be seen to be believed. He told me that no woman with a spark of delicacy or ladylike feeling would venture to hint at her husband's past follies; that it came with a very bad"], [62, "54 ON THE BRINK. grace from me, who knew how to play the prude when it suited my purpose ; with much more to the same effect. In conclusion, he ordered me to send out of the house at once the little wretch I had chosen to take by the hand, who might be his son or any one's else ; and he wound up by saying that, as I had thought fit to bring a case of infectious fever into his house, I might stay in it as long as I pleased myself, but that for his part he should not return to it that year, at all events, if in deed he ever set foot in it again. A pleasant letter, was it not, for a girl of nineteen to re ceive a few months after her marriage ! It is true, as I heard afterwards, that he had that very day lost a large sum of money on the Leger. \"However, it had two good effects. It opened my eyes, and it confirmed me in my resolution not to abandon the poor boy, whose life I really believed I had been the means, under God, of saving. I announced my determination to Lord Tenby, and after rather"], [63, "ON THE BRINK. 55 a lengthened correspondence, whether it was that he was ashamed of himself, or, which is more likely, that he wras afraid of the story being known, he graciously gave me permission to do what I liked with the child, provided I did it all at my own expense, and that he himself was never brought into contact with him. These terms I have adhered to. Hugh Graham, as he is called, is now at an excellent school in Kent, and comes to see me occasion ally, when there is no chance of his meeting his father. Last year he passed his summer holidays with me at Cromer, but it is seldom, poor fellow, I can manage such an excursion as that for him. I may also mention that I thought it right to inform his grandfather, Mr. Graham, of what I had done for him, and his answer was very much on a par with Lord Tenby's. He said that, as he had once dis owned his daughter, he now disowned her son, and never wished to hear of either of them again. Compton could not trust himself to make"], [64, "ON THE BRINK. 56 any comment on the tale he had just heard. He merely said, \" He must love you well.\" \" He does. You heard him call me mamma, and I think I may say that he feels for me the affection of a son. I have no children of my own, and though I have sometimes regretted it, perhaps it is better that it should be so.\" \" And what do you mean to do with him ? Judging by his appearance, he will soon be too old for school.\" \" Ah, that is my great difficulty. That is where I want advice and assistance.\" \" Dear Lady Tenby, what advice and assistance I can give you is yours. But you must tell me what your plans are, or at least what your wishes are respecting him.\" \"I have formed none, except that I wish him to enter some profession which may give him the position his birth denies him. I have a little more than six hundred a year of my own. My father originally settled ten thousand pounds upon me ; at my marriage he doubled it, and insisted upon its being secured to me,"], [65, "ON THE BRINK. 57 so as to give me the absolute disposal of the interest during my life, with the power of leaving the principal to any one I please at my death. Thus I have had it in my power to give Hugh an excellent education, and when that is finished, I shall make him a moderate allowance as long as he requires it. But he must make his way in the world by his own exertions. He has talent and energy, and if fairly started in life I have no fear of his doing well.\" \"I will think it over,\" said Compton. \"It is not a question to be decided in a hurry, and fortunately we have plenty of time before us. My own opinion is, that to succeed in any profession, one ought to have a vocation for it. Have you any idea what Hugh's own wishes point to ?\" \" It is a subject which we have never dis cussed ; but now that I have found a coadjutor, I will talk to him about it. And you will be a friend to him, Arthur, for my sake ?\" \" Rely upon me. That is to say, if he will"], [66, "58 ON THE BRINK. allow me, for I do not think he looked upon me with any great show of favour.\" \"You must make allowance for him. He feels his position acutely, and never having met with kindness from any one but me, looks with suspicion upon strangers. Not without reason. Even Lord Tenby's family, with whom I am upon excellent terms, do not half like my taking him under my protection. They did remonstrate with me once or twice on the subject, till I was obliged to tell them my mind pretty freely, and then they thought it as well to let the matter drop. For you must know, Arthur, little Nelly is now a great lady, and few would like to incur her dis pleasure.\" \" Oh, yes, I am quite aware of it. We are not so far behind the rest of the world in India as not to have heard of Lady Tenby, though certainly I was far from connecting her with my old friend.\" \" And he does look up to you with admira tion,\" she continued. \" I cannot tell you all"], [67, "ON THE BRINK. 59 the questions he used to put to me about you, when we read of all your exploits during that horrid mutiny. Do you remember, Arthur, almost your last words to me were, that you wished to do something to make your sister proud of you ? I am proud of you.\" \" Is Hugh staying with you ?\" Compton asked, rather abruptly. \" No. I cannot venture to give him a bed in this house. He is staying at my aunt's ; she always takes him in when he comes to London. Ah, I must except her, when I say no one treats him with kindness.\" \" She is kind to every one, as I know of old. If you will give me her address, I will call on her to-day, before I return home if possible ; if not, to-morrow certainly.\" \" Do. Nothing could give her greater pleasure ; and if you wish to do her a real kindness, and your other engagements allow you, go and drink tea with her. Her evenings are generally passed alone.\" \" I will not fail to do so,\" said Compton,"], [68, "60 ON THE BRINK rising to depart. \" You know she prophesied that when she next saw me it would be as Colonel Compton.\" \" And about Hugh,\" she said ; \" you will think about him ?\" \" Certainly. But I think it would assist our operations if I had an opportunity of improving my acquaintance with him. Will you allow him to dine with me to-morrow, and I will take him to some theatre afterwards ?\" \"Oh, thank you. He will be enchanted. How I wish I could go too !\" \" Well then, we will say six o'clock. Here is my card, with my address. And when may I call on you again ?\" \" As soon as you please, after having seen my aunt. I am almost always alone from twelve till two.\" He was in the act of opening the door, when she exclaimed, \" And my first question of yesterday; you have never answered that. What has become of Leo ?\" \" Leo is dead ; but he passed a very happy"], [69, "ON THE BRINK. 61 life, and died in an honourable old age. I left him with my cousin Philip, and his grandfather took such a fancy to him that he was allowed all sorts of privileges, such as had never before been enjoyed by dog at Compton Manor. In short, he became Sir Ralph's constant com panion, and died two days after his old master. Philip has had a stone put over his grave, with his name and virtues duly recorded.\" On leaving Lady Tenby's house, Compton took the direction of Ebury Street, in which locality Mrs. Elizabeth Thorpe lived, but he had not gone far before he changed his mind, and began to retrace his steps to his own hotel. The reason he gave to himself was that Lady Tenby had requested him rather to choose the evening for his visit to her aunt ; but the truth was that, much as he wished to hear Nelly's history, he felt too much agitated by all the disclosures of the morning to venture so soon upon a second edition of them. It would be, perhaps, too much to say that he had ever been in love with Nelly Thorpe, a girl of twelve"], [70, "ON THE BRINK. 62 when he last saw her, but it is certain that he had felt for her more than brotherly affection. In all the stirring scenes in which the last years of his life had been passed, the recollection of his adopted sister had never faded from his memory, notwithstanding all communication had ceased between them. Judging of her and her aunt by himself, he had never for a moment attributed their silence to forgetfulness or neglect, but to accident, or circumstances over which they had no control. He deter mined, on his return to England, to seek them out, and renew his intimacy with them. He had now, by his own exertions, won an honour able position in the w-orlcl ; his future prospects were good ; and in his day-dreams he frequently dwelt upon the possibility of inducing Nelly Thorpe to share them, and accompany him to India as his wife. Judging by what he had seen at Longwater, he thought that, as Colonel Compton, he could offer her a destiny as bril- liant as any she was entitled to expect. Appa rently deserted by her father, with no protector"], [71, "ON THE BRINK. 63 but an aunt, who must now at all events be an old woman, what could she do better than unite her fate to that of a man who would love and cherish her, and shield her from harm ? Beauty, accomplishments, or even any great elegance of manner he did not expect, but he knew her to be affectionate, docile, and intelli gent, and he required no more. During the forced inactivity of his journey home he had dwelt on these thoughts, till they rose to the height of a real passion. Strange to say, the possibility of her being already married had never entered his head. And now, how rudely had all these dreams been dispelled ! She was married, and, worse than all, married to a man utterly unworthy of her. He fancied that, had her husband been a man to love her as she deserved, had she found with him domestic happiness and peace, he could have been satisfied, and not wasted a moment's thought on his own disappointment. But now, not only was she lost to him, but to herself. She had nothing to look forward to"], [72, "64 ON THE BRINK. but years, long years, of wretchedness, and, it might be, of repentance. When presented to Lacly Tenby on the pre ceding day, not the slightest suspicion of the truth had presented itself to his mind, which is not surprising ; for, setting aside the impro bability of finding Nelly Thorpe transmuted into a countess, there were in Lady Tenby but few traces of her former self. Nelly was de cidedly plain in feature, short and rather square in stature, and more unformed in manner than girls usually are even at that age ; a little too tomboyish, in short. Lady Tenby, on the con trary, was not more remarkable for her beauty than for her graceful and rather tall figure, while the refinement of her manners was such as almost to incur the reproach of fastidious ness. But with all this she had failed in making a favourable impression on Compton, on his first introduction to her. He set her down as a mere fine lady, in no way different from other fine ladies ; if not impertinent, at least spoilt by the adulation of the world, and"], [73, "ON THE BRINK. 65 accustomed to see her slightest wish obeyed by those around her. It was not till she pro nounced the magic word Leo, that the spell was broken, and he did her the justice to acknowledge that she might have had a better reason than mere caprice for wishing to make his acquaintance. From that moment his heart began to warm to her. Could she have read his feelings, in all pro bability she would have been less abrupt in proclaiming her identity. Although Compton contrived to a great extent to maintain his outward composure, the shock was severe. As he looked at her and listened to her, he dis covered, now that his eyes were opened, many little particularities of voice, gesture, and even of feature, which strongly reminded him of the Nelly of his youthful days, and with it came the conviction that she was dearer to him than ever, dearer than he could ever have imagined possible. With the injustice of a disappointed man, he accused her, he did not precisely know of what, but at all events of having raised up vol. i. p"], [74, "ON THE BRINK. 66 a barrier between them which was insurmount able. What were the circumstances which had led to her marriage with Lord Tenby he knew not, but what he did know was, that he had a prior claim to her affection ; and she, on her side, ought to have felt convinced that, as soon as he had it in his power to offer her a home and a competence, he would return to England to share them with her. These thoughts flashed through his brain with the rapidity of lightning ; but he was not a man to enervate his mind by long dwelling on ills that were irremediable. He armed himself to meet them with fortitude. His first and principal object was to prevent the possibility of any betrayal of his feelings. For this purpose he had assumed an indifference of manner, which made but a sorry contrast with the warm and affectionate language with which Lady Tenby alluded to the ties of friend ship, which had once existed between them. He was near giving way, it is true, when she reproached him for his coldness. Had he"], [75, "ON THE BRINK. 67 yielded to the impulse of the moment, he would have caught her in his arms, pressed her to his heart, and rushed from her presence, never to return. But he mastered the temptation with out much difficulty, and calmed down by degrees, his manner and language becoming more cordial as he did so. By the time she had concluded the story of Hugh Graham's birth and his father's unnatural conduct, ever}* other feeling was merged in one of indignation and abhorrence for Lord Tenby, and deep pity for his victims. Lady Tenby, taking Hugh by the hand and shielding him from the con sequences of his father's neglect, was still the Nelly who had protected Leo from the cruelty of his persecutors. From that moment Compton vowed to dedicate himself entirely to her ser vice, even, if need were, at the expense of his profession. If it was not given to him to call her by a dearer name, at least she would still be the adopted sister of his youth ; in him she would ever find the support and devotion of a friend, the watchful affection of a brother."], [76, "ON TEE BRINK. 68 CHAPTER IV. It was still light when, on the same evening, Compton knocked at Mrs. Thorpe's door. He refused to give his name to the maid who opened it, and merely told her to announce him as an old friend. He heard Mrs. Thorpe exclaim, \" An old friend ! Pray beg him to walk in.\" \" Yes,\" he said, entering the room, \" a very old friend, come from afar to see you.\" Aunt Thorpe was seated in an arm-chair, Avith a shade over her eyes, employed in knit ting.

She referred me to you for all ex planations ; but I saw quite enough to prove to me that the subject is a painful one.\" \"Painful indeed. It is a sad, sad tale. But you shall know all, as indeed you have a right to know. Let me give you some tea, and then, when we are safe from all chance of interruption, I will begin my story.\" Compton was not a tea-drinker, and as soon as the maid had cleared the table, and taken her departure, Mrs. Thorpe commenced her narrative. \" To make everything clear, I must begin at the beginning. There were two of us, my sister Eleanor and I. When our mother died I was twelve years old, and my sister some years younger. Our father was a clergyman holding a small living in the county of Durham. He was a very clever man, and had taken a very good degree at the University, to which, indeed, I believe he owed his benefice, for he was entirely without interest or connections."], [79, "ON THE BRINK. 71 To us he was ever a most indulgent father, too much so perhaps for our good ; but his unalter- able good-nature and tenderness of heart were closely allied to an easiness of disposition, which made him the victim of any one who chose to take advantage of it. After our poor mother's death, I was naturally freed from the domestic tyranny of the nursery, and I soon emancipated my sister. We were allowed to do exactly what we pleased, to learn as much as we liked, to eat, drink, sleep, play as much as we liked, and to run wild all over the country. If my father did not take much care of his children, it is not surprising that he did not take more of his money. In the course of a few years he found himself embarrassed, and, as a means of adding to his income, announced his intention of taking pupils. In this plan he was encouraged by the Head of the college to which he had belonged, whom he consulted, and who pro- cured for him the son of Mr. Halsted, the great London banker. The terms offered were ex tremely liberal, three hundred a year, but with"], [80, "ON THE BRINK. 72 it was coupled a condition, that as long as Mr. William Halsted remained at Breaford \u2014 the name of our village \u2014 my father was to receive no other pupils without Mr. Halstecl's consent. \" When William Halsted came to us he was four and twenty. His youth had been a wild one. At fourteen he quarrelled with his father, ran away from school, and went to sea. A few years later he enlisted as a private in some dragoon regiment, from which old Mr. Halsted at last bought his discharge. They were now reconciled, but as his education had necessarily been very much neglected, he was sent to my father for a couple of years, to repair its defects, after which he was to be taken into the bank. Although I did not like him, I must do him the justice to say that he was good-looking, and had not lost the manners of a gentleman. Agreeable, when he chose to give himself the trouble, but violent in temper, and with a sullen determination about him which nothing could bend. He soon became the tyrant of our"], [81, "ON THE BRINK. 73 house. My father was the first to yield to his despotism, and the very servants obeyed his orders more scrupulously than they did those of their master. I was the only one who attempted to resist, but without much effect, and was sneered at and snubbed, in conse quence, on every occasion. Eleanor alone was possessed of the spell by which his wayward disposition could be held in subjection. In her presence the tiger became a lamb. \" At that time she was twenty. I will not attempt to describe her. She was my pet, my darling, as she was of every one who knew her. Nelly is beautiful, but to my mind she could never be compared to her mother. Well, you can guess that they soon fell in love with each other, he with all the fierce energy of his nature, she with all the tenderness and unselfish devotion of a trusting heart. When my father was informed of their engagement, he positively refused his consent. It was a breach of trust, he said, by which he would be dishonoured in the eyes of the world, and,"], [82, "ON THE BRINK 74 worse than that, condemned by his own con science. What would Mr. Halsted think of him ! \" To which William very coolly replied that he had no intention of taking his father into his confidence. Of course Mr. Halsted would be furious, and no doubt would discard him for ever, if he heard of it. The marriage was to be kept secret, for the present at all events. \" For the first time in his life, perhaps, my father was firm. He said that under the cir cumstances he must decline keeping Mr. William Halsted any longer as a member of his family, and begged him to make arrange ments for his departure by the end of the week, at latest. Eleanor was given into my charge, with strict injunctions to prevent any inter views between the lovers. But the tears stood in his eyes as he said it. \"He little knew the man he had to deal with. That afternoon William Halsted went over to Durham and obtained a license for the marriage. On his return he showed it my"], [83, "ON THE BRINK. 75 father, and told him that, Eleanor being under age, he had boldly asserted that she had her father's consent. She had promised to marry him, he was determined to hold her to her word, and if driven to extremity, he would carry her off by force, rather than run the risk of losing her. ' Therefore, Mr. Thorpe,' he said, ' it remains with you to decide whether you will sanction your daughter's marriage, and perform the ceremony yourself, or force us to go to a neighbouring parish, which cannot be done without a certain amount of publicity, and in all probability will entail utter and irremediable ruin upon all of us ; upon me, your daughter, your daughter's children, if she have any, and yourself.' \" My father yielded, less, I firmly believe, to William's arguments and threats, than to Eleanor's tears. They were married in great secrecy, and for one year, one year of happi ness, continued to reside with us at the vicarage, nor during that time had my sister ever cause to repent her choice. Her husband"], [84, "76 ON THE BRINK. was passionately in love with her, and treated her with the utmost tenderness ; indeed, he became more gentle in his dealings with all of us. At the end of that time he was sum moned to London on account of the illness of old Mr. Halsted. During his absence his wife was confined, and died after giving birth to our poor Nelly. As soon as he heard of her danger he hurried back, but was too late to see her alive. His grief, his despair, were some thing frightful to witness, but it was the grief of a madman. He accused us all of neglect, of being accessories to her death ; when, God knows, there was not one member of the family who would not cheerfully have laid down his life as a ransom for hers. In his ravings he accused heaven itself of injustice and cruelty. As for his daughter, the innocent cause of our great sorrow, he called her the murderess of her mother, and refused even to look at her. He said that, as soon as it was in his power, he would make a provision for her, but that he would never see her. He departed as soon as"], [85, "ON THE BRINK. the funeral was over, never to return. His last words to me were, ' Though you do not like me, you loved your sister, and to you I give up her daughter, to bring up as you think fit. For the present I shall allow you two hundred a year for the expenses to which you may be put on her account, but I never wish to hear her mentioned, or to have any correspond ence with you on that or any other subject.' \" Another year passed, and I lost my poor father. Since Eleanor's death he had never held up his head. It killed him, and I think it would have killed me too, but for the little creature confided to my care. My father had insured his life for five thousand pounds, which he left to me for my life, half of it to go to little Nelly at my death, the other half to be at my own disposal. In a pecuniary point of view I was well provided for, and I took a small house, or rather cottage, at Breaford, not far from our old home. I could not bear the thoughts of leaving the place in which I was born, in which my father, mother, and sister"], [86, "78 ON THE BRINK. were buried. Notwithstanding his prohibi tion, I thought it my duty to announce to my brother-in-law the death of my father, and the steps I had taken in consequence. Many months elapsed without bringing me an answer. When he did write, it was to tell me that his father was also dead, that he was now the head of the house, and in a position to provide for his daughter. 'But,' he con tinued, ' I intend before long contracting a second marriage, and for many reasons I wish to banish all recollection of Breaford and its inhabitants. I propose therefore to settle ten thousand pounds upon Eleanor's child, on con dition of her assuming her mother's maiden name ; and to prevent all chance of her being identified, you must leave Breaford, and establish yourself in some other county, the further the better, but not in London. You must also give me your promise never to divulge the secret of her birth to any one without my express permission.' Then he added that, as long as my niece remained with"], [87, "ON THE BRINK. 79 N me he should continue to allow me two hundred a year ; and I was to dispose of the interest of her little fortune as I thought best during her minority, or till her marriage with my approbation. 'For,' he finished by saying, ' I know I can trust you.' The first expression of regard or good-will I ever received from him. \" If there were some parts of this letter which gave me pain, it also relieved me from great anxiety. I had always been haunted by the dread of having my little Nelly taken from me. I had taken it into my head that, when old Mr. Halsted died, William would proclaim his marriage and send for his daughter, in which case I felt that she would be lost to me. This fear was now dispelled. Virtually Nelly was disowned by her father, and left without a relation in the world except myself. Hence forward she would be my child, with no one to stand between us. I was satisfied, although to find Eleanor so soon forgotten, hurt, as much as it surprised, me."], [88, "80 ON THE BRINK. \" I wrote immediately to Mr. Halsted, an nouncing my acquiescence in the terms he proposed, and immediately began making preparations for our removal. I saw in a country newspaper an advertisement of a small house to let at Longwater. Thinking it might suit us, I wrote to engage it for a couple of months by way of trial, and there we passed eleven peaceful and happy years. It was there you found us. I wrote again to Mr. Halsted, giving him our new address. To that letter I received no answer ; but we had not been established at Longwater much more than a month, when I saw in the paper the announcement of the marriage of William Halsted, Esq., to Lady Miranda De Lacy. \" What our life was at the Lakes, you know. Soon after you left us, following your advice, I took Nelly two winters running to Edinburgh, where she had the best masters the place afforded; and at Ambleside I was fortunate enough to find a lady who came over to Long water three times a week during the summer,"], [89, "OA THE BRINK 81 to continue her education. But all this you know from our letters. It was only a few days after I had written to you, for the last time, as it turned out, that I was thunder struck by receiving a letter from Mr. Halsted, thanking me for the care I had hitherto be stowed upon his daughter, and informing me of his intention of acknowledging her as such, making her his heir, bringing her to London, and in short, to use his own expression, relieving me of the charge, and taking it entirely upon himself for the future. He added, that he presumed I was not inclined to throw any impediments in his way. \" I felt as if I had received my death-blow, a blow more grievous than the death of my poor sister. I was half tempted to resist. I believe I might have done so successfully ; and the last phrase in Mr. Halsted's letter seemed to show that he had some apprehensions of that nature. But I reflected that I had no right to allow my own feelings to stand between Nelly and her inheritance, still less between her and her VOL. i. g"], [90, "82 ON THE BRINK. father's affection. I wrote to Mr. Halsted, to say that at his bidding I was ready to resign my charge ; but I did not attempt to conceal from him my anguish, and I dwelt in strong terms on the hardness of my fate, in being compelled in my old age to relinquish the society of one to whom the best years of my life had been devoted. I suppose my readi ness to comply with his request pleased him ; perhaps he was touched by the expression of my grief; at all events, he replied by a very civil letter, saying that he thanked me for my ready compliance with his wishes, that nothing could be further from his thoughts than a total separation between his daughter and the aunt to whom she owed so much ; but with his pre sent views, he thought it desirable that her education should be finished under his own eye, and that she should be gradually intro duced into the society of his family and connections. He could not offer me a home in his own house, but he would advise my settling in London, somewhere near him, when I should"], [91, "ON THE BRINK. 83 have ample opportunities of seeing my niece ; and to make this more easy of execution, he hoped I would allow him to convert the two hundred a year he had hitherto allowed me into an annuity for my fife, as a slight acknowledgment of the debt of gratitude he owed me. In a month or six weeks at latest he should expect me and my charge in London, and he begged me to communicate to her his intentions, and prepare her to receive him as a father. \" This letter, written in so totally different a strain from anything I could have expected from the William Halsted I had known, filled me with such surprise, that it was some time before I could convince myself that it actually was his composition. The cause of this sudden revolution in his feelings I discovered at a later period. Mr. Burnthwaite, his confidential clerk, to whom all his business communications with me, after our arrival in London, were dele gated, was the brother of the medical man who attended us at Breaford, where I had seen him"], [92, "84 ON THE BRINK. frequently. Belonging to the same part of the country, an intimacy naturally sprung up between us, and from him I learnt much of what I have now to relate. \" It appears that by his second wife Mr. Hal sted had an only son, on whom he doted, and who, by Mr. Burnthwaite's account, was a child of whom any father might have been proud. Of course Mr. Halsted looked upon this son as the destined heir of his immense wealth, but in his tenth year he died of scarlet fever, or rather of its consequences. Again his father fell into the same passionate agonies of grief that had followed the death of his first wife. He shut himself up for weeks, and refused to be comforted. It was probably during this time of desolation that he bethought him of the daughter he had renounced. At all events, on emerging from his solitude, he announced his intention of sending for her, and placing her in the position to which her birth entitled her. In vain Lady Miranda protested against this decision, declaring that nothing should ever"], [93, "ON THE BRINK. 85 induce her to play the part of a mother to the daughter of the low-born woman who had entrapped Mr. Halsted into his first disgrace ful marriage. Her object, no doubt, was to secure for a favourite nephew the reversion of the banking business, and perhaps of all her husband's property ; in short, to place him in her son's shoes. She had already succeeded in obtaining for Mr. De Lacy a conditional promise of being admitted as a junior partner, if after a certain probation he showed himself fit for it, and in the mean time he lived at Mr. Halsted's quite on the footing of a son of the house. \" But Mr. Halsted's determination was rather strengthened by this opposition. The small amount of influence which Lady Miranda had ever possessed over him was destroyed by the death of his son, and the want of feeling which she exhibited on that occasion. Cold by nature, she did not think it necessary to make any violent demonstrations of a grief which she was incapable of feeling, or much sympathy for that of her husband. There never had"], [94, "86 ON THE BRINK' existed any great affection between them. Mr. Halsted was some years younger than his wife, who at no time of her life could have had much beauty to recommend her. It was a marriage of ambition, and perhaps vanity, on one side, of interested calculation on the other. \" Mr. Halsted persisted in his plans, and wrote his first letter to me, to announce them. I have no doubt that the civilities to me, contained in his second letter, were sincerely meant, and certainly he has acted up to them as well as circumstances allowed. At the same time there was probably a tinge of worldly wisdom in them, as far as wishing to secure my influence with his daughter in his favour. I did my best for him, as I should have done under any circumstances, for I felt that Nelly's future happiness must depend in a great measure upon her obtaining her father's love and confidence. I grieve to say I was not very successful. I told her of her mother's early life, of her marriage, of her death. I"], [95, "ON THE BRINK. 87 trust I did full justice to the love which Mr. Halsted had felt for his wife, the happiness she had enjoyed during the few months of her married life, and the agonies of grief into which her death had thrown him. In vain ! I could not instil into her mind any affection for the father who had entirely abandoned her for thirteen years, who had never shown the slightest interest in her welfare, and who now recalled her apparently from a movement of caprice. His second marriage, so soon after the death of the wife for whom he had pro fessed such devoted attachment, and his deser tion of her child, appeared to her as insults to her mother's memory, and proofs of his utter heartlessness. I argued with her in vain. Though so young, she had a great deal of her father's inflexible pertinacity, which does not decrease as she grows older. And I sometimes feel that I ought to thank God for it. Such a disposition, to most a curse, has proved to her more than once a blessing. A weak-minded woman would have sunk under what she has"], [96, "88 ON THE BRINK. gone through, and I fear, I much fear, her worst days are yet to come. \" But to proceed. We came up to London, and by Mr. Halsted's instructions, to this house. He had bought the lease of it in my name, and furnished it for me. In money matters he was ever most liberal, more so than most men. He called upon us on the evening of our arrival, shook hands with me, and just kissed his daughter's sorehead, but even to that, I, who knew every turn of her countenance, saw that she submitted with reluctance. On his part, it was evident that he was disappointed with her appearance, though he said nothing. Although much grown in the course of the last two years, she was still short for her age, her skin was tanned and freckled, and it must be confessed that her dress was better adapted for the Longwater moors than for a London drawing room. I ought no doubt to have taken better order for this, but to say truth, I never thought of it. Mr. Halsted's visit was not a long one. We all felt embarrassed, he as much as either"], [97, "ON THE BRINK. 89 Nelly or myself, and our conversation, if such it could be called, was restrained, as must always be the case between those who have few topics in common, except those which are better avoided. On leaving, he said that he thought Nelly had better remain with me till her wardrobe had been thoroughly renovated, for which purpose he would send the proper tradesmen on the morrow. \" As soon as he had left the house, Nelly threw herself into my arms, and entreated me with tears to let her remain with me. I soothed her as well as I could, though God knows the task was a hard one ; I stood too much in need of consolation myself. \" At length the day of parting arrived. On that I will not dwell ; but I felt as if the last tie that bound me to earth was severed. Mr. Halsted came for her himself, took her home, and presented her to his wife, who contented herself with holding out a finger to her and hoping she was well. It was a tacit declaration of w*ar, and was accepted as such."], [98, "ON THE BRINK. 90 \" Before I go further with Nelly's story I will finish about myself. Before I left Longwater, I had for some time felt an uneasy sensation in my eyes ; but thinking it would pass off, I had not paid much attention to it. I had not, however, been a week in London, before it increased so much that I became alarmed. I do not suppose my fretting did me much good, for, to confess my weakness, I passed the greatest part of my nights in tears. I con sulted an eminent oculist, and he told me at once that I was threatened with loss of sight, and that I must confine myself to a darkened room, and give up all reading and writing. That is the reason why you never heard from me after my being settled in London. Nelly wrote to you twice, I know ; but I have every reason to believe that her father intercepted, and probably burnt the letters. He wished to obliterate every trace of his daughter's early career, in other words, of his own culpable neglect, and to sever her from any friends she might have made. This we did"], [99, "ON THE BRINK. 91 not know at the time, and we grieved over your silence, but we always did you the justice to believe that it was involuntary. We never accused you of having forgotten your old friends. \" As long as Nelly remained in London she came regularly to see me twice a week, and Mr. Halsted behaved to me with the greatest kindness and consideration. He procured for me a maid who could read out to me, and he provided me with the best medical attendance at his own expense. Mine was not a case for an operation, but after a long course of treat ment I recovered my sight sufficiently to find my way about the house, to distinguish the features of persons when close to me, and even to read very large print, though I am not allowed to do so for more than ten minutes or a quarter of an hour at a time. But I am thankful for that, and the many other blessings which have been vouchsafed to me. Nelly still loves Auntie, and that is the greatest of all. If you are not tired of my long story, and"], [100, "92 ON THE BRINK. my prosy way of telling it, we will return to her.\" Compton assured her that so far from thinking her prosy, he had been admiring the clearness of her recital, and begged her to continue her narrative, in which he felt the deepest interest."], [101, "ON THE BRINK. 93 CHAPTER V. \" Nellt was now formally installed as an in- mate of her father's house, but her life was not a happy one, exposed as she was to the ill-will of Lady Miranda, and feeling more like a prisoner in a hostile camp than one of the family. The servants naturally took their tone from their mistress, and treated her with neglect, sometimes with impertinence. The governess who had been provided for her, having been recommended by a friend of Lady Miranda, looked up to that lady as her patro ness, obeyed her orders, and was always ready to act upon her suggestions. Of her father Nelly saw but little. During the day he was"], [102, "94 ON THE BRINK. occupied with his business, and his nights were mostly spent in the House of Commons, of which he was a member. Nor were his manners calculated to win her confidence. It seemed as if he felt that she had a right to reproach him for his past conduct, and shrank from making overtures which might be re jected. But his words were always kind when he did address her, and by degrees the feelings of repugnance which she had at first entertained against him died out. Still, she could not tell how far he had the power, or even the wish, to protect her against the petty persecutions of which she was daily and hourly the victim. That question, however, met with a solution before long. Happening to overhear Lady Miranda's maid make Nelly a very insolent reply upon some occasion, he discharged her on the spot, giving her only four-and-twenty hours to transport herself and her goods and chattels elsewhere. Lady Miranda was furious, and said she neither could nor would do without Minniver; to which Mr. Halsted replied, that if"], [103, "ON THE BRINK 95 that was the case there was nothing more to be said ; that for his part he would not allow the offender to remain in his house, and that if Lady Miranda really could not do without her, the only remedy he could suggest was that mistress and maid should depart together. Her ladyship left the room in great wrath, but she did not leave the house. \" Soon after, Miss Skinner, the governess, also came to grief. She was detected in the act of rapping Nelly's knuckles with a heavy paper knife, for some faults she had made in the execution of a difficult piece of music, so se verely, that the poor child could not refrain from tears. Being called to account for this piece of violence, she alleged that Nelly was so idle, stubborn, and perverse, that it was the only way of dealing with her. ' That may be,' Mr. Halsted replied, ' or it may be that you do not understand how to manage her. I have no means of judging, but naturally my prepossessions are all in favour of my own flesh and blood. At all events, you have"], [104, "96 ON THE BRINK. exceeded your authority, and I must request you to look out for some other situation ; the sooner the better.' \"Miss Skinner departed, and Mr. Halsted found himself in great perplexity as to what should be his next step. He allowed Nelly to come to me for a week, at the end of which time he announced his intention of sending her to a school he had heard of at Brighton. She was not sorry to go ; she had had quite enough of home discipline. Her father's intervention in her favour had excited her gratitude, certainly, and she felt that with a little encouragement she could have loved him. But, strange to say, now that he had made some progress in her good-will, he seemed anxious to repress every demonstration of it, and carefully to avoid everything that might call forth an expression of affection. Mr. Burnthwaite said that he was convinced that this seeming repulsion arose from Nelly's reminding her father of the son he had lost- There wras no resemblance in feature, he said,"], [105, "ON THE BRINK. 97 but he himself had noticed several little pe culiarities of manner which perpetually recalled her brother to his recollection. \" Nelly went to school at Brighton, and there she remained four years, during which time I saw next to nothing of her. Her summer vacations were devoted to excursions with her father, generally abroad, and in winter she accompanied him in his country visits. Whenever she was in London she came to see me ; and at each visit, as my sight began to mend, I could notice a marked improvement in her appearance and manners. She liked her school, her mistresses were kind and attentive, and she was on excellent terms with all her companions. ' I should be per fectly happy there,' she said, ' if I could have dear old Auntie there too.' She never alluded much to her father. When she did, it was in terms of respect, but the affection of a child was wanting. It was a delicate subject to touch on, but I did once remonstrate with her. ' Yes,' she replied, ' I know I am wrong, VOL. i. h"], [106, "ON THE BRINK. 98 for I believe he means to be kind, but he is so cold and\u2014 in short, I cannot get on with him.' \"At length her education was pronounced complete, and she returned to London. To Mr. Halsted's infinite surprise, the first sug gestion that it was time to introduce Miss Halsted into society came from his wife, who offered to present her at court, and take her out under her wing. As some sort of explana tion of this change of feeling, she said that when she last saw Nelly she had found her so totally different from anything she had expected, so good-looking, so lady-like and quiet, that all her prejudices had vanished. Liking society herself, it would greatly enhance her pleasure if she were accompanied by one who would do her so much credit, and in whose success she could take an interest. \" Mr. Halsted knew his wife too well to be more than half a dupe of these fine-sounding phrases. He had no faith in this sudden con version ; but he thought that Lady Miranda, enlightened by former experience, wished to"], [107, "ON THE BRINK. 99 make a merit of necessity, and secure domestic peace by compliance with his wishes. This certainly may have had some weight with her, but her plans were far more extensive. She wished to secure the heiress for her nephew, and as a necessary preliminary, to establish herself in the said heiress's good graces. \"Nelly, as I call her, or Eleanor, as Mr. Halsted insisted upon her being called by those who had a right so to address her, took up her abode at her father's house with anything but agreeable anticipations. She looked forward to incessant disputes and quarrels with the stepmother who had per secuted her as a child, who, even down to their last interview, had always contrived to discover something to find fault with, who had always something disagreeable to say. She was now eighteen, and feeling tolerably sure of her father's support, she was fully determined to resist every attempt to treat her with in justice. She came prepared for war; great, therefore, was her surprise at finding herself,"], [108, "100 ON THE BRINK. before she knew where she was, in Lady Miranda's arms, who kissed her, called her her dear child, and carried her off to the apartment which had been prepared for her, and which had been fitted up with every comfort and luxury that heart could desire. \" I suppose Lady Miranda overdid it. At all events, Nelly was not deceived by it. She met her stepmother's advances civilly, but that was all. She could not forget past times, and the systematic oppression of which she had been the victim on her first arrival in London, at a time when she stood most in need of kind ness and sympathy. Now she recoiled from caresses of which she could not understand the motive, but which she felt intuitively did not proceed from affection or good-will. If she did not feel for her father a daughter's love, at all events she felt she could trust him. He made no professions, but his cold, abrupt, and arbitrary manner inspired her with confidence ; Lady Miranda's blandishments with nothing but distrust."], [109, "ON THE BRINK. 101 \" For a time everything went on smoothly enough. With Mr. De Lacy, who lived in her father's house, she had of course been ac quainted from the first moment of her entering it herself. From him she had never expe rienced unkindness, for the simple reason that he had never noticed her at all. He had ig nored her presence altogether, a system infi nitely more galling to a girl of her age than any other which he could have adopted. Now all this was changed. He devoted himself to Eleanor's service. He was her constant at tendant everywhere ; at balls, at the opera, in Rotten Row ; and, being well supported by his aunt, pretty nearly succeeded in monopo lizing her entirely. \" At first I think she rather liked it. She fancied she was revenging herself for former slights by giving him all sorts of commissions, possible and impossible, to execute, and gra ciously allowing him to follow her about like a dog. He was tall, good-looking, and amus ing, as far as being well versed in all the gossip"], [110, "ON THE BRINK. 102 and scandal of the day. Beyond that he had not much to say for himself, but of that he made the most, and he certainly was in the best society of London. There is no doubt dear Nelly was a little dazzled at first. He was the first specimen of his class with whom sue had ever fallen in, his aunt was perpetually singing his praises, and she saw that those praises were very generally confirmed by the voice of the world she lived in. But the spell did not last long. His stock of small talk came to an end, and she made the discovery that the world did contain men more agreeable than the Honourable Lionel De Lacy. Once or twice she was annoyed by his claiming her as a partner when she fancied herself disen- gaged, and compelling her to refuse some one with whom she had much rather have danced. She noticed also that it seemed to be understood that De Lacy had some sort of vested right in her, and that when he ap proached her, the men by whom she might be surrounded at the time dropped off one by"], [111, "ON THE BRINK. 103 one, sometimes with a sort of half smile, which annoyed her all the more that she could not understand it. She was enlightened at last. Her father sent for her one morning to his own room. ' Eleanor,' he said, ' I am going to ask you a plain question, and I expect a plain answer. Has there been any love nonsense between you and De Lacy ?' \" Although rather startled by such a question put in such an abrupt manner, she answered without a moment's hesitation, ' Between me and Mr. De Lacy ! Most certainly not.' \" ' I believe you,' he said. ' You have never, since I have known you, been guilt}r of an untruth, and I do not think vou would begin now on such a subject.' \" ' You do me no more than justice, sir,' she replied.

However, he continued, ' It is but right that I should tell you why I ask you.

Now I daresay it would suit him very well to marry one of the greatest heiresses in England, and it would be equally agreeable to Lady Miranda to see her nephew so well provided for, but it would not suit me. I require for my daughter's husband something better than the spendthrift younger son of an impoverished peer. I have the promise of a peerage, and should have claimed it, had my poor son lived. As it is, I shall let it drop. In these days a female peerage is out of the question, and I care nothing for honours which must die with me. It is to you I look for the advancement of our family.

This much, however, I promise, to enter into no engage ment unknown to you.' \" ' No, Eleanor,' he replied, ' that is not enough. You must promise not to accept at tentions from any one, particular attentions, that is \u2014 you know what I mean \u2014 without my approbation ; and should any one make you a proposal of marriage, you will refer him to me for an answer.' \" She reflected for a moment, and then said"], [114, "106 ON THE BRINK. that she could promise nothing more than she had already offered to do. \u25a0\"\"Well,' he continued, 'we will not discuss this further at present.

Even now in that respect she keeps to her Longwater habits. \" Mr. Halsted continued : ' With regard to De Lacy, I hardly know what to advise. To come to an open rupture would be giving too much importance to him, and set the world talking, which is always better avoided. I shall however tell Lady Miranda that it is my wish that he should cease to be an inmate of my house when we return to town in November. I shall also beg her not to encourage any intimacy between you and him, as I hear it has already been commented on. But my great dependence must be on you. You must keep him at arm's length as much as you can.'"], [116, "108 ON THE BRINK. \" ' But how can I, sir ?' said poor Nelly. ' He accompanies us everywhere, and always engages me for half my dances beforehand. And sometimes he says he is engaged to me when I am sure he is not. It was only last night that I was obliged to refuse Lord Tenby for the cotillon, after accepting him.' \" Nelly said her father could not help smiling at this enumeration of her distresses. He probably found the arrangement of a young lady's dancing engagements a more difficult task than to direct the operations of the money market. At length he said, ' Vou had better tell him that we have been talking over your balls and parties, and that I was displeased to hear of your dancing so often with the same man. It was not so in my day, and I desire you not to do so in future.' \" ' And what shall I say to Lady Miranda, sir ?' Nelly asked next. ' She is certain to question me as to what has been the subject of our conversation.' \" Mr. Halsted answered this question by"], [117, "ON THE BRINK. 109 another. 'What should you like to do this summer, Eleanor ?\" \" She replied that Lady Windermere had asked her to go to her for a few weeks, while Lady Miranda went to her brother's, and that if it could be managed, she should like to accept her invitation. \" ' By all means,' said her father. ' How old is Lady Windermere's son, Lord Bertram ? Quite a boy, I suppose ?' \" Nelly told him that Lord Bertram was just six years old. \" ' I am sorry he is not twenty years older. He would have suited me very well for a son in-law. Lord Windermere is a fine specimen of an English nobleman.' \" Nelly was so much amused by the idea of this miniature husband, that she answered, ' I can wait for him, if you wish it, sir.' \" ' No, no,' he replied, with a laugh ; ' I am afraid that will not quite do.

Lady Windermere told me I might come to her whenever I had had enough of London. And as she has asked Auntie too, we could go down together.' '\"A very good plan. I am very glad to hear that she has asked Mrs. Thorpe. I have a great respect for your aunt ;' and then he said all sorts of civil things about me, after which he continued: 'Now you have your answer ready cut and dried for Lady Miranda's interrogatories. We have been talking over your London season, and settling our plans for the summer.' \" Nelly came to me in a state of great excitement the same day, and told me all that"], [119, "ON THE BRINK. 111 had passed between her father and herself. 'Now I understand it all,' she said, as soon as she had concluded her narrative. \" ' All what ?' I asked. \" ' All Lady Miranda's civilities, all Mr. De Lacy's attentions ; and oh, Aunt, now I know why people smiled when they made way for him to approach me.

But depend upon it you have not done with him yet. You must be prepared with an answer in case he does propose to you.' \" ' Oh, Aunt, what shall I say ?' \" ' Well, my love,' I said, ' I never had an offer of marriage to accept or refuse, so I cannot advise from any experience of my own.

As soon as Mr. De Lacy recovered from his surprise, he requested to know what those circumstances were. \" ' I cannot,' said Mr. Halsted, ' trust the affairs of my bank to a gambler. You lost"], [121, "ON THE BRINK. 113 upwards of a thousand pounds at Epsom and Ascot, and to meet your engagements had recourse to usurers, who of course made you pay pretty handsomely for the accommodation.' \" Mr. De Lacy protested that the story was a fabrication, and glancing at Mr. Burnthwaite, who by his master's desire had remained in the room, said that he was at no loss to guess from whom it emanated. \" ' In that case,' Mr. Halsted replied, open ing a drawer and taking out a bundle of papers, ' these bills purporting to be accepted by you are forgeries, and we will at once apply for warrants against the delinquents.' \" Mr. De Lacy now had not a word to say in the way of denial, but he was foolish enugoh to take it up in a high tone. He had done nothing more than what hundreds were doing every day, and he certainly did not expect his private affairs to be made the subject of such inquisitorial investigation. It Avas what he could not submit to. \" ' And that you may never be exposed to it vol. i. T"], [122, "114 ON THE BRINK. again,' rejoined Mr. Halsted, ' on my part at least, we will part company.

And as it is, or may be, important to the credit of my esta blishment that no actual or possible connection should be supposed to exist between us, I think it better that you should no longer continue to reside in my house. You can remain there if you please till we all leave town, which will give you time to make other arrangements.\" \" ' In short, sir,' said Mr. De Lacy, with a sort of sneer, 'a month's warning, like any other servant.' \" ' If it gives you any pleasure to look upon it in that light, pray do,' replied Mr. Halsted. 'I did not send for you, however, to bandy words with you, but to make known to you my intentions. From this day you will cease to make part of this establishment, and in a month's time of my family. I feel however"], [123, "ON THE BRINK. 115 that the time you have passed here might perhaps have been employed by you in cultivating some other profession with more success, and, though it is your own fault that I cannot realize the expectations I held out to you, I have no wish to be hard upon my wife's nephew. Here is a cheque for ten thousand pounds, which I trust you will consider a sufficient compensation for your disappoint ment. As for these bills, which I bought of your friend Mr. Barabbas, I shall keep them for my own justification, but I need not say they will never be presented for payment.' \" My dear Arthur, what will not money do ! Mr. Burnthwaite says that Mr. De Lacy was now as abject and profuse in his expressions of gratitude, as he had been insolent in manner a few minutes before. He took the cheque, and turned his back upon the bank for ever. \" I fancy Mr. De Lacy had an interview with his aunt before Mr. Halsted's return home, and, I have no doubt, they agreed that it was"], [124, "116 ON THE BRINK. advisable to lose no further time in prosecuting their plans upon Nelly. How they could have supposed for a moment that her father would consent to her marriage with a man whom he had just dismissed from his employment, I cannot conceive. Perhaps Mr. De Lacy only wished to hind her by a secret engagement, and trusted to time for a solution of the difficulties in wdiich it would involve her. Be that as it may, he proposed to her that very night, and was refused iu very courteous, but very explicit language. She told me he bore it very well, and expressed a hope that he might still reckon upon her friendship. Lady Miranda was not so forbearing, whether it was that she felt her nephew's disappointment more acutely than he did himself, or that now, that there was no longer any necessity for disguise, she indemnified herself for the restraint of the last few months. Amongst other things, she told Nelly that the encouragement she had given Mr. De Lacy, and drawing him on to make her an offer for the pleasure of rejecting"], [125, "ON THE BRINK. 117 it, proved her to be a heartless coquette ; for her part she would never forgive it, and if she still consented to chaperon her, it would be solely out of deference to Mr. Halsted, and for his sake to save her as much as possible from the well-merited censures of the world.\""], [126, "ON THE BRINK. 118 CHAPTER VI. \" Nelly and I passed a very happy month at Lord Windermere's, after which she went with her father to Switzerland, where they fell in with Lord Tenby, and formed that intimacy with him which has been attended with such disastrous results for my poor child's happi ness. In London she had known him merely as a dancing acquaintance, but now they wrere thrown perpetually together, and Mr. Halsted encouraged it. Nelly was delighted at finding herself once more in a land of lakes and mountains, which reminded her of Longwater, and was never so happy as when making long excursions on foot. Mr. Halsted was not"], [127, "ON TEE BRINK. 119 equal to this sort of work himself, but he allowed her to go out rambling for hours together with Lord Tenby, and no attendant but a Swiss guide. Certainly, if two people were inclined to fall in love, there could be no better way of promoting it ; but I am certain Nelly's heart was untouched. She liked Lord Tenby as an agreeable companion, who devoted himself completely to her service and amuse ment during the few weeks they were together. She felt grateful to him for his constant atten tion to her slightest wish, or even caprice ; she even felt for him the regard due to one on whose friendship she thought she could rely ; but there it stopped. On her return to England she used to talk of him, and all the wonderful feats they had performed together, without the slightest embarrassment, with the most unstudied composure. And yet he was a man of the most pleasing and attractive manners ; one, I should say, peculiarly adapted to win the heart of a young girl who had never known what love is. I believe him to be"], [128, "ON THE BRINK. 120 thoroughly unprincipled, nay more, profoundly vicious ; but no one could guess it from any thing in his manner or conversation. He came to see me once with Nelly, soon after their engagement, and I too, like an old fool, fell under the charm. \" But what seemed to me at least as extraor dinary as Nelly's indifference, was that of Lord Tenby. That a young man \u2014 at that time he was not thirty \u2014 a professed admirer of beauty, should be brought into daily and hourly contact, and that by his own choice, with a girl who, to say nothing of her great expectations, certainly had her fair share of good looks, with that natural and unaffected manner which is generally supposed to have a peculiar charm for men of the world, and should never have been betrayed even into a passing expression of admiration, seems incredible. And yet so it was. They lived on the most familiar terms, but it was the familiarity of companionship, not of affection. I could not refrain from questioning Nelly a little closely one. day on"], [129, "ON THE BRINK. 121 the subject, and I suppose with no great amount of discretion, for she found out before long what turn my thoughts were taking. ' Ah,' she said with a laugh, ' I see you fancy that we fell in love, or at least that Lord Tenby fell a victim to my attractions. I am sorry to destroy your romance. There was nothing of the sort. His admiration was all bestowed on my courage and activity. As for the charms of my face and mind, of which you think so much, they passed quite unnoticed. We were excellent friends, but of love there was not a grain, on one side or the other.' \" Now that I look back to the events of the last five years, I feel convinced that Lord Tenby was playing a deep game. My belief is, that even at that time he intended to pay off the incumbrances on his estates by a marriage w*ith Mr. Halsted's heiress, that he had even contrived to meet them in Switzer land as a preliminary step. His property was very extensive in England and Scotlaud ; his nominal income was a large one, but owing to"], [130, "ON THE BRINK. 122 hereditary debt, and his own extravagance, he was always in a state of embarrassment. Of this Mr. Halsted was aware, for he himself held a mortgage to an immense amount on his principal estate ; but Mr. Halsted was not a man to allow a question of money to interfere with a favourite plan. He meant to have not only a peer for his son-in-law, but a peer of good family and ancient descent ; and he knew that his chances of success would be infinitely greater with a needy man, than with one who might think wealth which he did not require too clearly purchased by a plebeian alliance. Lord Tenby was too quick-sighted, and had too much knowledge of the world, not to be very soon aware that, as far as the father was concerned, he had the game in his own hands. Mr. Halsted was a bad dissembler, as most men are who rule all within their own small circle with despotic sway ; and I have no doubt was as little able to conceal his wishes as his impatience at the slow progress which attended them. Lord Tenby probably thought that"], [131, "ON THE BRINK 123 by holding off he would be able to obtain better terms. Still, I was puzzled to know why he did not attempt, at all events, to establish for himself an interest with Nelly, till I heard accidentally that Mr. De Lacy said everywhere that Mr. Halsted had refused his consent to his daughter's engagement to him, had insisted upon her breaking it off, and, on her demurring, had carried her abroad, in the hope that change of scene would wean her from her attachment. It struck me that, if this story had reached Lord Tenby 's ears, he might have thought that it was rather too early in the day for him-4e-plead his own cause with much chance of success. \" All this, however, is only surmise on im part. It may have been true, or it may not ; but what is certain is, that there was another cause quite sufficient to account for Lord Tenby' s backwardness, though unfortunately we only knew of it when it was too late. It appears that at the very time when he was in Switzerland an action was hanging over his"], [132, "124 ON THE BRINK. head, as defendant in a case of divorce at the suit of Colonel Brooklyn, and he was moving heaven and earth to effect a compromise. In this he eventually succeeded, but only shortly before his return to England, and till that was settled he must have felt his hands tied as regarded making a proposal of marriage. \" They all left Switzerland together, Lord Tenby accompanying them as far as Paris, where he remained, while they came on to London. They parted excellent friends, Lord Tenby promising that his first visit on his return should be to Lady Miranda and Miss Halsted. I do not suppose that Mr. Halsted, notwithstanding this gracious assurance, was very well pleased with this termination of their intimacy, which threatened to frustrate all his plans. But he was not easily discouraged. He had set his heart upon seeing his daughter Countess of Tenby, and he determined, in case the gentleman made no further move in the right direction, to try what a little gentle coercion would do. He obtained an accurate"], [133, "ON THE BRINK. 125 list of Lord Tenby 's debts and liabilities, bought them up as quietly as possible, and then waited patiently for his debtor's return to England. \" In the mean time poor Nelly's life was anything but a pleasant one. Lady Miranda's animosity was as great as ever, aud showed itself in all those little arts of ingeniously tormenting, which are all the more acutely felt that they afford no tangible ground for com plaint. It was the end of October when Mr. Halsted and his daughter returned to England. At that time of year there were few of Nelly's acquaintance in London, and the greatest part of her mornings she spent in her own room, glad to escape from the incessant sneers and innuendoes of which she was the victim when alone with Lady Miranda. She generally came to me for an hour or two after luncheon, and would gladly have passed her evenings with me, but her father found out that he could not do without her ; that in the course of the last two months he had become so used to"], [134, "126 ON THE BRINK. her society, that she must devote herself to him during the only hours in the day he could call his own. What particular pleasure he could have found in this intercourse it would be hard to say, for they had no pursuits, hardly any ideas in common. Generally she took up a book after dinner, while he, tired by his day's work, slept away the hours in an arm-chair till it was time to continue his slumbers in bed. If Lady Miranda was at home, she followed his example without so good an excuse ; but this was seldom the case. She now formed one of a coterie addicted to whist, who met alternately at each other's houses ; when it was her turn to receive, they all retired to the sanctuary of her own boudoir. \" After Christmas matters mended a little. Balls and parties recommenced, the whist was abandoned, and Lady Miranda, accompanied by Nelly, again began the round of fashionable London life. But her ladyship's manner had not become one whit more gracious to her stepdaughter, and the poor child has more than"], [135, "ON THE BRINK. 127 once told me that it was as much as she could do to refrain from tears at the cruel things that were said of her and her manner of conducting herself. She was accused of flirting with one, of making herself conspicuous with another ; she was told that she was fast; that if she went on as she did, women would soon look shy upon her ; that already very disagreeable com ments had been made in Lady Miranda's hear ing on her behaviour. Pure fiction, I verily believe, but hardly the less galling on that account. These lectures were generally de livered on their way home, aud Nelly remarked that they were longer and more caustic the more she had danced and enjoyed her evening. From one dreaded source of annoyance she was free. Mr. De Lacy appeared to have abjured the ball-room and society in general. \" Scarcely less harassing and irritating than Lady Miranda's malevolence, was the super vision that Mr. Halsted thought proper to exercise over all his daughter's proceedings. They had resumed the practice of breakfasting"], [136, "ON THE BRINK. 128 together, and then Nelly was subjected to the closest scrutiny into the way in which the preceding clay and evening had been passed. Those to whom she had spoken, those with whom she had danced, were subjects of anxious inquiry and comment, sometimes of warning. She was obliged to recal every word spoken to her, and all she had said in reply. Between the two, the father and the stepmother, she never knew a moment's peace. She told me that she meant this to be her last season ; that nothing should tempt her to expose herself again to such a system of an noyance. \" At length Lord Tenby again made his appearance on the scene. He had not re deemed his promise of calling on Lady Miranda, but Nelly met him at some party, and he evinced no disinclination to resume his familiar intercourse with her. He sat near her the whole evening, and, in fact, devoted himself to her so exclusively, that she had to undergo a more serious lecture than usual"], [137, "ON THE BRINK. 129 upon the gross impropriety of her conduct. Against Lord Tenby himself Lady Miranda seemed to be animated by some feeling of a personal nature. She said that he was no toriously the most unprincipled and profligate man of the day ; that it was a disgrace to be noticed by him ; that he had damaged the reputation of more girls than any man in London ; that it was well known amongst his intimates that he had not the slightest inten tion of marrying ; but that his practice was to attach himself to some girl through the season, and, when he had made her sufficiently talked of, to drop her altogether without further cere mony. \"Of course, Mr. Halsted was informed of Lord Tenby 's return to England, and the cordiality of his greeting. ' Did he say why he had not called here?' was Mr. Halsted's only question. To which Nelly replied that he had made some excuse, something about business, she believed, but he had said it all in such a droll way, and they had both laughed von. i. K"], [138, "130 ON THE BRINK. so much, that she did not recollect exactly what it was. \" A fortnight or more passed away, Nelly meeting Lord Tenby almost every night, but he neither paid his promised visit, nor could Mr. Halsted discover that their intimacy was drawn any closer, or seemed likely to change its character. He thought the time was come for an explanation, and no doubt he felt himself aggrieved by Lord Tenby's positive rudeness, who never even thought it necessary to leave a card on him. He directed Mr. Burnthwaite to write to his lordship, stating that as Mr. Halsted had embarked in very large financial operations, for which all his capital would be required, he wished to know what arrange ments Lord Tenby was prepared to make for liquidating the very heavy claims on his property, secured to Mr. Halsted by mortgage. \" I suppose Lord Tenby must have felt a little surprise at this summary proceeding ; but at all events it compelled him to make up his mind at once. The very next day he pro-"], [139, "ON THE BRINK. 131 ceeded to the bank, and having asked for Mr. Halsted, was speedily ushered into his presence. That gentleman received him with great coolness, and did not even take the hand which was offered him. He pointed to a chair, and asked to what he was indebted for his lordship's visit. \" It was not a promising beginning, and Lord Tenby answered, with an embarrassed laugh, ' Well, in the first place, to pay a visit which I ought to have paid long ago, and to apologize for having deferred it so long, though I trust Miss Halsted has explained that it has been from no want of respect or inclination on my part.' \" ' Permit me to observe, my lord,' replied Mr. Halsted, ' that I receive visits of friend ship or civility at my private residence. Here my time is devoted entirely to matters of business.' \" ' Exactly ; and as it is also on matters of that nature that I wished to speak to you, 1 thought you would allow me to combine a visit"], [140, "132 ON THE BRINK. on business with one of civility, or rather of friendship, if you will permit me to say so.' \" Mr. Halsted made a stiff inclination of his head, and his visitor continued : ' I have re ceived an intimation from your house that you are desirous of the repayment of the sums of money advanced by you ' \" * Pardon me, my lord, for interrupting you,' said Mr. Halsted, 'but believe me, your best course will be to put me in communication with your solicitor. It is very unusual for a gentleman in your lordship's position to enter upon such matters without professional advice. In fact, it might lay me open to the impu tation of taking advantage of you, and you must not be offended if I decline listening to you.' \"'Mr. Halsted,' rejoined Lord Tenby, 'I must entreat your patience for a short time. The proposal I am about to make cannot very well be made through an attorney. If it do not meet your concurrence, when you have heard me out, you will say so.'"], [141, "ON THE BRINK. 133 \" ' Well, my lord, I will hear what you wish to sav.' \" ' Then,' said Lord Tenby, ' the case, as I take it, stands thus. I owe you upwards of two hundred thousand pounds ' \" ' Two hundred and seventy-three thousand two hundred and ninety-five pounds, fourteen shillings and sevenpence,' said Mr. Halsted. \" ' Indeed !' said his lordship. ' I was not aware it was so much ; but whatever it may be, there can be no doubt that my property is amply sufficient to cover it. At the same time, if I were forced to sell in a hurry, or under pressure, it could only be done at an immense loss. In short, it is quite impossible for me to repay you at present. But it strikes me that a way might be found for conciliating our respective interests. If I cannot pay you what I owe you I can make your daughter a countess ; and if my great uncle, the Duke of Glencoe, who is now seventy and childless, dies without children, I succeed him in the dukedom. I have long admired Miss Halsted ;"], [142, "134 ON THE BRINK. give her to me for a wife, and I will make such a settlement of my property as you may deem satisfactory.' \" Now that he had brought Lord Tenby to the point, Mr. Halsted did not manifest any great eagerness in following up the advantage he had gained. He observed coolly that it was rather a large price to pay for a coronet, even a ducal one. '\"Perhaps so,' was the reply; 'and yet I shall be still more exacting. Great as the advan tage would be to me in a pecuniary point of view, I should not be satisfied with Miss Halsted's hand unless accompanied by her affection.' \" ' Will you allow me to ask, my lord,' said Mr. Halsted, ' if you have ever made any dis closure of your feelings to Eleanor ?' \" ' Certainly not,' replied Lord Tenby. ' To address Miss Halsted, with her immense expec tations, without having previously obtained her father's consent, would justly expose any one to the imputation of being a mere fortune hunter ; and in me it would be doubly culpable"], [143, "ON THE BRINK. 135 after the generous confidence you reposed in me last autumn in Switzerland.' \" Oh, my dear, how well he could talk ! He would have lured the birds from the trees. I suppose he could have used no lan guage better adapted to flatter Mr. Halsted's self-love and his ideas of paternal authority. Still he could obtain no positive answer. My brother-in-law was silent for a few minutes, and then said, ' Your lordship's proposal, how ever flattering, has come upon me too unex pectedly to allow of my coming to a positive decision respecting it at once. Besides, it is but fair that I should consult my daughter, as, after all, she is the principal person concerned. You shall hear from me in the course of to- morrow. \" Lord Tenby, after a few more observations, took his departure, and then Mr. Halsted summoned Mr. Burnthwaite from an inner room, where he had heard all that had passed. ' Well Burnthwaite,' said his patron, ' what do you say now ?'"], [144, "136 ON THE BRINK. \" Mr. Burnthwaite, from whom Mr. Halsted had few or no secrets, had been in this matter also his confidant throughout, and had been employed in the somewhat delicate task of buying up Lord Tenby's liabilities. In the course of his inquiries he had heard many cir cumstances of the noble lord's previous career, which had left a very disagreeable impression on his mind. Of course he communicated all he had heard to his employer, but without much effect. Mr. Halsted professed a belief that all young men were much upon a par, and he declared that for his part he should greatly prefer a son-in-law who had sown his wild oats to one whose follies were all to come. Mr. Burnthwaite was not a convert to this doc trine, and he still entertained grave doubts as to the wisdom of the course Mr. Halsted was pursuing. It was not his business, however, to put forward his opinion till it was asked for. When it was, he usually gave it in the shortest possible form of words. On the present occasion, in answer to the banker's"], [145, "ON THE BRINK. 137 question, he merely said, ' Dear at the price, sir.' \"Mr. Halsted is never offended by the bluntness of his favourite clerk. He knows that, independently of the ties of interest, Mr. Burnthwaite feels for him a real friendship, and is entirely devoted to his service. Pro bably, too, Mr. Halsted connects him with his own residence at Breaford, and his courtship of my sister. For Mr. Burnthwaite spent a month or six weeks there just before Eleanor's marriage ; and as he frequently passed the evening with his brother at our house, he must have seen enough to excite his suspicions of what was going on. A time-serving man would have jumped at such an opportunity of currying favour with his master, but Mr. Burn thwaite kept his own counsel. 'It was no business of mine,' he said to me once when we were talking over bygone days. ' Old Mr. Halsted paid me my salary to do his work in the bank. It formed no part of my duty to act as a spy upon his son. Had he propose^"], [146, "138 ON THE BRINK. it to me, I should have thrown up my situa tion.' \"When old Mr. Halsted died, Mr. Burn thwaite was still a junior clerk in the bank. My brother-in-law took him by the hand at once, and soon placed him in the confidential position he now occupies. No explanation ever took place between them. Mr. Halsted is too proud a man to acknowledge himself under an obligation to an inferior \u2014 a false pride as it seems to me \u2014 but I am convinced that in his own mind he did full justice to his clerk's honourable conduct. At all events he trusts Mr. Burnthwaite implicitly, and having great reliance on his judgment, consults him not only on all matters of business, but frequently on his private affairs. \" To return from this long digression. Mr. Halsted took his clerk's observation in good part. 'Ah,' he said, 'that is because you look at everything with those mercantile eyes of yours. You see only hampered estates ; I see my grandson Duke of Glencoe.'"], [147, "ON THE BRINK. 139 \" ' Even that, sir, may be purchased too dear, if your daughter's happiness is part of the price paid for it.' \" ' Nonsense, Burnthwaite !

But, after all, I am not going to play the part of a tyrannical father. I shall tell Eleanor what has passed, and certainly shall make no secret of my own wishes ; but if she has really any very strong and decided objec tion to Lord Tenby, which, however, I do not anticipate, I shall not urge them. She shall decide for herself, and that she may be able to do so uninfluenced, I must request that you will not mention a word of what has passed to your friend and ally Mrs. Thorpe, or indeed to any one, till it is settled one way or the other.' \"The Halsteds dined alone that day, and when Lady Miranda and Nelly were leaving"], [148, "ON THE BRINK. 140 the room after dinner to prepare for the opera, Mr. Halsted asked his daughter if she would stay at home and give up that evening to him, as he wished to talk to her. She consented, of course, while Lady Miranda observed that it was provoking that Mr. Halsted had not thought proper to announce his wishes earlier, that she might have asked one of her own nieces to accompany her. ' And I hope,' she added, ' that you will take this opportunity of representing to Eleanor the extreme impropriety of her conduct with Lord Tenby, who is only making a fool of her, and whom she encourages by every means in her power. I have spoken to her on the subject till I am tired of it; perhaps you may be more successful. At all events, I have done my duty by mentioning it to you.' \" ' What is this about Lord Tenby, Eleanor ?' Mr. Halsted said, as soon as they were alone. \" ' Just nothing, sir. Of course, after all our rambling and scrambling together in Switzer land last year, I feel more intimate with him"], [149, "ON THE BRINK. 141 than with any one else, and we have many more subjects of conversation ; but I can safely declare that I do not talk to him or dance with him more than with many others ; scarcely so much indeed, for he has a large acquaintance.' \" ' Is that all ? Lady Miranda seemed to insinuate that there was more than the common courtesies of society in Lord Tenby's attentions to you. In short, in plain English, that he was making love to you, or you to him.' \"Nelly told me that she could not help laughing at the idea. ' There is no more love on Lord Tenby's side,' she said, ' than there is on mine.' \" 'You are mistaken, Eleanor,' Mr. Halsted rejoined, in a tone of voice so serious that it banished all further wish to laugh ; and then he related to her all that had passed between Lord Tenby and himself that morning, com menting on it as he proceeded, and pointing out in very forcible language all the advan tages she would derive from such a connec tion."], [150, "ON THE BRINK. 142 \" Nelly was not dazzled by them. She said, and truly, that she had never yet seen the man whom she should like for a husband, that she had never given the subject a serious thought. She had no wish to marry, at present at all events. ' It is very hard,' she said, ' people will not let me alone. First it was Mr. De Lacy, and now it is Lord Tenby.' \" ' My dear Eleanor,' rejoined her father, ' I hope you do not mean to put the two on a par.' '\"No, certainly not,' she replied. 'I readily admit Lord Tenby's superiority to Mr. De Lacy, as far as I am able to judge. He is clever and well-informed, and can apply his cleverness to something better than the gossip of the day. He is good-tempered ; at least I have never seen him otherwise ; he is perfectly natural and unaffected ; his manners, especially to women, are particularly refined ; and yet there is something, I hardly know what, which at times leaves a most unpleasant impression. I think it is that he is never serious, he laughs at everything and every-"], [151, "ON THE BRINK. 143 body, turns everything into a jest. I cannot help laughing, too, but I am angry with myself afterwards ; for I know he is wrong when he maintains that we are surrounded by none but hypocrites, and that if some men and women are more respected than others, it is merely because they are more successful in concealing their faults.' \" ' Depend upon it, my dear Eleanor,' replied her father, ' that he makes these silly speeches, for I grant that they are silly, and not in the best taste, merely to astonish you and to see what you will say. Lord Tenby has behaved in this business with a delicacy that proves him to have very honourable feelings, and I always judge a man by his acts rather than by idle words. I do not suppose that his life hitherto has been passed in monkish austeri ties ; I dare say he has been guilty of as many follies as other young men ; but I have no doubt that when he does settle down to do mestic life, especially if he marries a woman he loves, he will abjure them for ever.

' On the contrary, I think I like him better than any other man of my acquaint ance ; at least I prefer his society to that of any one else.' \" ' Well, then, Eleanor, listen to me. That Lord Tenby is attached to you I have no doubt. On the other hand, I have as little that, with a closer and more intimate associa tion, the feelings which you already entertain for him as a friend would soon expand into the affection of a wife.

Had I brought you home at an earlier period, in all probability things would have been placed upon a more satisfactory footing, but it is useless to speculate upon what might have been. After all, I am the greatest loser, for I am aware that you do not, you cannot, feel for me the affection of a daughter. But at least trust me as your best friend, as one whose principal object is to secure your happiness.' \" It was something so new to Nelly to be ad dressed by her father in this tone, that it took her heart by storm, as it were.

Unfortunately he took a most erroneous view of the means by which that happiness was to be secured. I do not mean to say that Nelly was indifferent to the advantages of rank and position. Who is? But most assuredly with her they were but secondary objects.

I am afraid she dwelt upon Lady Miranda's anticipated mortification, when she found all her prophecies falsified by the event, with more zest than she ought to have done. If such was the case, God knows the fault has been severely expiated, poor child ! \" But I am convinced that Nelly's principal motive, or one of them at least, was a desire to please her father. No doubt the terms and tone which Mr. Halsted had made use of came from his heart, but had he studied how to address her with most chance of success, he could have selected none better adapted to effect his purpose. They formed such a complete contrast to those which he was in the habit of using. In general, even when he meant to show kindness, his language was abrupt, not to say cold ; but on the present"], [158, "150 ON THE BRINK. occasion he gave way to expressions of affection and regret for the past, which found their way at once to his daughter's warm and loving heart. When she told me all that had passed, she dwelt much upon the tenderness of his manner when asking her to rely upon him as her best friend. ' I think I shall be very happy with Lord Tenby, Auntie,' she said. ' I shall trust my fate to him without any misgivings ; but even were it a sacrifice, I feel that I could make it without hesitation, as some return for the affection which has been so long withheld from me, and which I have so anxiously desired to obtain.' \" The following morning she told her father at breakfast that he might inform Lord Tenby that she accepted his proposal. \"'And you are very sure, Eleanor, you do it without repugnance ?' Mr. Halsted asked. \" ' Without the slightest,' she replied. ' I have known him now for some time, I liked him from the first, you recommend him to me"], [159, "ON THE BRINK. 151 for a husband, and I have every confidence in your judgment.' \" I have often wondered if Mr. Halsted could have heard this speech without wincing a little. Surely he must have felt that he was taking a great responsibility upon himself. especially if he called to mind Mr. Burn thwaite's revelations. But some people have a strange knack of forgetting what they have no wish to remember. He showed no doubt of his daughter's future happiness in his reply. He thanked her for her ready com pliance with his wishes, and again entreated her to believe that, much as he desired this alliance, nothing would have tempted him to press it upon her, had he not believed that Lord Tenby was in every way worthy of her. \" Nelly came to me as soon as her father's breakfast was concluded. To say that I was surprised would be to say nothing. The day before I knew she was free as air, without a thought of marriage, and now* she was positively engaged. It would be impossible"], [160, "152 ON THE BRINK. to describe my sensations, they were such a strange mixture. On one hand, I must confess that I was delighted by the brilliant worldly prospects opening for my darling. A countess now, a duchess in prospective ! And I knew she was worthy of it all, and would do honour to any station. But what of the husband she had chosen, or rather had been chosen for her? It was but a short time back that she had assured me that she liked him as a friend, and nothing more. It is true now her language was a little changed. She owned to a great regard for him, but more than this she did not profess, and I knew that from me she would have no secret. Of love, such as I had dreamt of in my young days, the love which her mother had felt for Mr. Halsted, there was not an iota. I cannot tell you how anxious this discovery made me. I even went the length of hinting that regard was but a very slight foundation on which to build a life-long connection. ' Dear Auntie, she said, and I think I heard something like a"], [161, "ON THE BRINK. 153 sigh as she spoke, ' best so. If I were really to fall in love with ray husband, in all pro bability I should be a miserable woman. I should be jealous, and exacting, and alto gether a very disagreeable wife. So pray be convinced, as I am, that in marrying Lord Tenby I am doing the wisest act of my long life.' \" I tried to be convinced, but without much success. Nelly had never been in love, it is true ; but what was there to guarantee that she might not hereafter, when it would be too late, meet with some one who might inspire her with more than regard. I knew her too well to fear that she would for a moment forget what she owed to her husband and herself. I knew that in her pure heart no thought of evil would ever find a welcome. But who should say that there might not be a struggle between duty and inclination. That duty would conquer I had not the shadow of a doubt, but at what a cost the victory might be won ! I confess that for long after her"], [162, "154 ON THE BRINK. marriage, more especially as Lord Tenby's character developed itself, I passed my life in a state of the most painful anxiety. From that I am now freed. For five years Nelly has passed unscathed through the most fiery ordeal to which a young, beautiful, and outraged wife could be subjected. Not a censure, not an innuendo even has ever been hazarded against her. Her husband's family condemn his conduct in the strongest terms, and would no doubt rally round her even more than they do, if she would give up Hugh. They do not do justice to her motives, and think she has taken him up in bravado, and merely to annoy Lord Tenby. How wrong they are in this, you know as well as I. She thinks he was unjustly treated, and this was quite enough to secure her sympathy. How ever, they are all very good friends with her, and the Duke of Glencoe asked her last year to spend a couple of months with him in Scotland, regretting that Lord Tenby's conduct rendered it impossible for him to extend the"], [163, "ON THE BRINK. 155 invitation to him. Nelly wrote him really an admirable letter, thanking him for his kindness, but saying that, as she was living in her husband's house, it was impossible for her to accept an invitation from which he was so pointedly excluded. To this the duke replied that, much as he regretted her decision, it raised her still higher in his estimation. \" But to return to my story. The preparations for Nelly's marriage were pushed forward with as much dispatch as possible. Lady Miranda was naturally very much disgusted with the turn things had taken, but she was obliged to put a good face upon it, and even to extend her amiability to Lord Tenby. Mr. Halsted spoke in so decided a tone, that she saw he was determined to be obeyed ; and all the bridegroom's family, amongst whom were some of Lady Miranda's most intimate acquaint ance and allies, made no secret of the satisfac tion with which they contemplated their kinsman's union with Miss Halsted. The bridegroom himself had not perhaps as much"], [164, "156 ON THE BRINK. reason to congratulate himself on the financial arrangements proposed as he had anticipated. In transactions of that nature he was no match for his future father-in-law, who profited so far by the information he had obtained from Mr. Burnthwaite, as to insist upon very stringent settlements. The whole of the Tenby property in England was conveved to Mr. Halsted in trust, to pay offtheincumb ranees, and to secure Nelly's jointure, and then was strictly settled upon the issue of the marriage, leaving Lord Tenby only a life-interest in it. Mr. Halsted, on his side, made them an immediate allowance of ten thousand a year, and Lord Tenby's Scotch property was nearly as much more. Besides this, Mr. Halsted gave them a year's income in advance, and bought the lease of the house in Eaton Square, which he furnished completely, and settled absolutely upon Nelly, whose own little fortune he increased to twenty thousand pounds, and secured to her own use. So they were not so badly off, and when the debts are all paid off it is thought they will"], [165, "ON THE BRINK 157 have about forty thousand a year. But Lord Tenby wanted a large sum of money down instead of the allowance, and was not at all pleased at its being refused. Mr. Halsted said he could afford to give them a yearly income, but he could not part with so much capital. Nor would he make any further settlement of his own property. He said it could not be done without the intervention of trustees, who might interfere with his business, but he said that his present intention was to make Nelly and her children his heirs. So when Lord Tenby saw there was nothing more to be had, he professed himself satisfied, as well he might be. \" The wedding-day was fixed, when, a few days previously, by some accident, Mr. Halsted found out the story of Lord Tenby's intrigue with Lady Emily Brooklyn. He came into the bank one morning in a state of great agita tion, told Mr. Burnthwaite what he had heard, and desired him to spare neither trouble nor money to obtain all the particulars. In this"], [166, "158 ON THE BRINK. Mr. Burnthwaite succeeded so well, that in eight and forty hours his master was in posses sion of copies of every letter and document which had passed between the Colonel and Lord Tenby. It cost some hundreds of pounds, Mr. Burnthwaite told me. He had bribed the head clerk of the colonel's solicitor. I cannot tell you, my dear, how shocked I was, for in my eyes the man who offers the bribe, the man who tempts to sin, is worse than the one who yields to temptation. I could not help telling Mr. Burnthwaite so, but he did not see it in that light. He said he was only carrying out the duty he owed his employer; if the other man failed in his, it was his own busi ness ; and much more, but he did not convince me. \" Well, it appears there could be no doubt that there was collusion between the colonel and his wife. Lord Tenby had played the part of a profligate fool, who had fallen into the trap laid for him ; and Colonel Brooklyn that of a scoundrel, who had sold his wife and"], [167, "ON THE BRINK. 159 his own honour for five thousand pounds, the price paid him to induce him to abstain from further proceedings. He and Lady Emily were living together, as if nothing had hap pened. \"How differently men must be constituted from us ! Mr. Halsted expressed himself perfectly satisfied. ' He has made a fool of himself. It will be a good lesson to him,' was his only observation. Mr. Burnthwaite is convinced that if Lord Tenby had been the cause of a separation between Lady Emily and her husband, and had then abandoned his victim to her fate, Mr. Halsted would at once have broken off the marriage. It may be so ; I cannot tell. All I know is that nothing of the sort took place, and my poor child's sacrifice was completed. If outward splendour could ensure happiness she must have been satisfied, for never was wedding celebrated with greater pomp and magnificence. It seemed as if all with whom she had the slight est acquaintance vied with each other in"], [168, "ON THE BRINK. 160 lavishing upon her the most costly presents. But I have not the heart to dwell upon these details. \" They were married, and went to spend their honeymoon in the Isle of Wight, where Lord Tenby had a small villa. The first letters Nelly wrote gave us unmixed satisfaction. If they were not exactly such as one might expect from a uew-married wife, they were written in excellent spirits, and did ample justice to her husband's kindness and atten tion. I, at least, expected no more. But then came one to her father which gave him a foretaste of what she had to expect. Amongst other things, she said that she supposed she might look upon their honey moon as concluded, for they were beginning to receive visitors. Colonel Brooklyn, who commanded one of the regiments at Ports mouth, and his wife, old friends of Lord Tenby, had arrived that morning, and were to pass a week with them. \" Without the delay of an hour Mr. Halsted"], [169, "ON THE BRINK. 161 w*ent down to Ryde, put up at the hotel, and sent word to the colonel that a gentleman just arrived from London wished to see him on urgent business. I suppose Colonel Brooklyn, as the gentleman had given no name, thought it advisable to bring a witness with him, and the one he selected was naturally the friend with whom he was staying. The waiter, as he had been instructed, showed them up to Mr. Halsted's room, and Lord Tenby's surprise, on finding himself in his father-in-law's presence, may be imagined. He must have surmised the cause of Mr. Halsted's unexpected arrival, but that gentleman gave him no time for questions or explanations. Turning at once to the colonel, he told him that he had anticipated his wishes by bringing his friend with him. He then informed him that he was perfectly cogni zant of all that had passed between Lord Tenby and Lady Emily. He read out the copies of all the documents with which Mr. Burnthwaite had furnished him, with the names of all the persons implicated, or who had taken VOL. I. m"], [170, "ON THE BRINK. 162 any part in the transaction, down to the butler and Lady Emily's maid, on whose evidence the plaintiff mainly relied. He also mentioned the sum, in consideration of which the suit had been withdrawn, and the bankers by whom it had been paid. Then he continued : ' Having thus proved to you, Colonel Brooklyn, that the whole of your transactions with Lord Tenby are perfectly well known to me, it only re mains for me to say, that if you and Lady Emily do not this very day leave the house inhabited by my daughter, or if either of you ever again presume to intrude your visits upon her, I will lay the whole case before the Commander-in-chief, who will decide whether you are a proper person to remain in her Majesty's service. I shall also publish all the details, that society may judge how far you are entitled to its intimacy.' \" When Mr. Halsted related the story to Mr. Burnthwaite, he said that the colonel had not a word to say for himself. He sunk into a chair as if paralyzed. It was only when Mr."], [171, "ON THE BRINK. 163 Halsted had finished speaking, that he said that the whole story was a fabrication from beginning to end. \"With Lord Tenby it was different, Mr. Halsted was proceeding to make some remarks on the indelicacy of his conduct, when his lord ship stopped him at once. ' Let us understand each other, Mr. Halsted,' he said. ' I shall allow no one to dictate to me what guests I am, or am not, to receive in my house. Your daughter is now my wife, and I feel myself perfectly com petent to assist her in selecting her friends and acquaintance, without your interference. As for the absurd story with which you have just amused us, it is, as my friend Colonel Brooklyn very justly designates it, a fabrication from beginning to end. He is an old friend of mine, and I was very happy to have it in my power to lend him a sum of money of which he stood in need. As for the other parts of your romance, I should take shame to myself if I thought it necessary to defend a lady whom I respect and esteem from the idle gossip of discontented"], [172, "164 ON THE BRINK. servants. I am afraid, Mr. Halsted, the intelli gence furnished you by your private police is hardly worth the money it cost you.' \" ' You seem to forget, my lord,' replied Mr. Halsted, ' that Colonel Brooklyn had actually begun a suit against you ; and that the final agreement expressly states that the money which your lordship so generously gave, not lent, was given on condition that the action should be withdrawn. But I will not discuss this matter further. Ill as 1 think you have behaved, I have no wish to quarrel with my daughter's husband. My business was with Colonel Brooklyn, my message was to him alone, though I am not sorry you should have been a witness to what has passed. The colonel knows my intentions, and that is suffi cient.' \" ' The colonel of course will do as he pleases,' rejoined Lord Tenby, taking up his hat to depart. ' But were I in his place I should treat your threats with the contempt thev deserve.'"], [173, "ON THE BRINK. 165 \"That evening Mr. Halsted returned to London, and had the pleasure of crossing over to Portsmouth in the same steamer which conveyed Colonel Brooklyn and his wife back to their garrison. They had taken the hint. and on that score Mr. Halsted's mind was at ease. Of course he was curious to see Lady Emily. He described her as a remarkably quiet, ladylike person, no longer very young, but still handsome ; one of the last persons, he said, whom, judging by appearance, he should have thought likely to be guilty of any impro priety of conduct. \"The next letter from Nelly contained lamen tations for the departure of their friends. The colonel had been suddenly recalled to Ports mouth by some tiresome regimental business, and Lady Emily, to whom she had taken a great fancy, had refused to remain without him, notwithstanding all their entreaties. Lord Tenby was quite put out about it, and no wonder ; they both seemed so much attached to him."], [174, "ON THE BRINK. 166 \"She did not long remain in this state of delusion. A short time after the Brooklyns had left them they returned to town. The Countess of Tenby was presented, and they plunged at once into all the gaieties of the season. Some charitable person took care to inform Nelly of the relations which had existed between her husband and Lady Emily. She had the wisdom and forbearance to say nothing to him of the discovery she had made, but she came to me in great distress of mind, asking my advice. She could scarcely have come to a worse person. She soon found out that I knewr all about it, and by degrees she got from me the whole story, including her father's journey to Ryde. In truth, I thought it better, as she knew so much, that she should know all ; that she should feel that in case of need she had an efficient protector in her father. \" But this source of consolation, as I intended it to be, she would not accept. She said that she was deeply grateful to him for this proof of his affection and good-will, but that, come what"], [175, "ON THE BRINK. 167 might, she would never appeal to any one for assistance in any differences with her husband. ' No, Auntie,' she said, ' I must fight my own battles, if battles there are to be, and now that I am warned I am not much afraid. Now you see how wise I was to marry without being in love. Under other circumstances I should have been miserable. As it is, I feel nothing but indignation for the insult which has been offered me. And yet perhaps in time I might have loved him. But that is over now. I can never love a man whom I distrust and despise. But what am I to do if I meet that woman, as is not unlikely ?' \" I said, ' If ever you do meet Lady Emily, I advise you to let her see by the coldness of your manner that you have no wish to renew your acquaintance with her.' \" They did meet \u2014 I think it was coming out of some theatre \u2014 and I suppose Nelly carried out my advice to the full. At all events it led to the first direct quarrel between her and her husband. He took her to task for what he"], [176, "ON THE BRINK. 168 called her caprice, and she told him without any circumlocution that she had no intention of knowing a woman who had been his mistress. That, had she known a month ago what she knew then, she should have declined an intro duction to Lady Emily at Ryde. Nelly did not give me any further details, but I have no doubt the scene was one of violence on his part and of quiet determination on hers. \" I suppose that when Lord Tenby found that his wife wras not to be intimidated, he gave up the attempt, or it may be that he was a little ashamed of himself. At all events, for some time she had no further cause of complaint. They went clown to Scotland together for the shooting season, with two or three friends of Lord Tenby's. Their visitors were not much to her taste, but at all events they were gentlemen, and if they did not give her much of their society, they gave her no cause of annoyance. Then came the Doncaster races, and the gentle men all went there, leaving Nelly alone. Lord Tenby had always been fond of racing,"], [177, "ON THE BRINK. 169 and he now took to it with greater ardour than ever. They say that at that very meeting he lost a prodigious sum of money, owing to his horse coming in the length of a head behind the other. Can you fancy, my dear, risking a fortune upon such a chance as that ! It really looks like madness, and sometimes I have fancied he was not quite right in his head. His brother, they say, died mad. \" Then came Hugh's history, which Nelly told you. Lord Tenby kept his word, and did not return to Scotland. On the contrary, he went to Paris, where I think he passes half his life. He stayed there some months, just writing one line to his wife, to say he was going, and another to announce his return. Since then things have gone from bad to worse. He soon threw off the mask completely, renewed his intimacy with Lady Emily, and half-a-dozen others of a still worse description, with whom he rides and drives about London, meeting his wife at every turn. He once actually stole, I can give it no other name, a set"], [178, "ON THE BRINK. 170 of sapphires of hers, and made a present of them to some creature on the stage. Nelly did not miss them till she thought she recog nized them on the person of Lucrezia some body, I forget her other name, who was singing the part of Semiramis. On her return home she questioned her maid about them, who told her that his lordship had asked her for them a few days before, and had enjoined her to secrecy, as he wished to have them new set as a surprise for her ladyship. The next morning she went to her husband's room, and asked him if he could go with her to the police office. ' Some one has stolen my sapphires,' she said, ' and as I saw them last night on Signora Lucrezia, I wish to obtain a sum mons against her, that she may explain to the magistrate how she became possessed of them.' \" She said Lord Tenby tried to persuade her that she must be mistaken, but his con fusion was evident.

' You will only make yourself ridiculous ; there was no stealing in the case at all. If you must know, some one was saying that the Lucrezia wanted some ornaments for her part, and as I thought you would have no objection, I offered yours. You were out, or of course I should have asked you.' \" ' Very well, my lord,' she replied. ' I trust to you to see that they are restored to me in the course of the day, and I beg such a thing may never occur again. I have a very great objection to seeing my jewels round the neck of such a woman as that.' ; \" ' You forget, Lady Tenby,' he said, angrily, ' that the property of a married woman belongs to her husband, who can dispose of it as he pleases.' \" ' Not in our case,\" she rejoined. ' I know that amongst other things my jewels and trin-"], [180, "172 ON THE BRINK. kets are secured to me, and me alone, by our marriage settlement.' \" ' I had no idea you were such a good lawyer,' said her husband, with a sneer. ' It is a pity you cannot practise at the bar.' '\"I am quite lawyer enough,' she replied, ' to know my own rights, and I mean to defend them.' \" Of course she gained her point. The jewels were returned that evening, accom panied, to her great disgust, by a note from the signora, expressive of her most grateful thanks for the loan. Nelly attributed this piece of impertinence, probably not without reason, to her husband's suggestion. Were it worth while, I could tell you twenty other instances of his utter disregard of the common decencies of married life. \"And yet, in justice to a man I have so much reason to hate, I must say that, perhaps, if Lord Tenby had early in life fallen into good hands, he might have turned out differ ently. Unfortunately for him he chose for his"], [181, "ON THE BRINK. 173 bosom friend a Mr. Marshall, an adventurer of notoriously bad character, without a shilling of his own, and living magnificently upon his friend's fortune. As a matter of course he pandered to all his patron's vices, and en couraged him in all his extravagance. No minallv he was the secretarv, in realitv the master of the household. He tried to bring Nelly under subjection, and at last treated her with such insolence that she insisted upon his dismissal. Lord Tenby was obliged to comply, but it wras too late for amendment on his part. Under the tuition of his evil genius, for such I have always looked upon Mr. Marshall to be, profligacy had become a second nature. Mr. Marshall's de parture brought no change in Lord Tenby's habits.\""], [182, "174 ON THE BRINK. CHAPTER VIII. \" Bad as this state of things was, Nelly had soon to submit to annoyances of another nature, and which she felt acutely. Lord Tenby's extravagance was such, that within two years of his marriage his affairs again fell into the greatest disorder, and his wife was worried from morning till night by tradesmen wanting their accounts settled, and even the servants clamouring for their wages, and all this without the slightest attempt on his part to assist her. It really seemed as if he thought he had no interest in the matter, and never made the slightest show of reducing his expen diture. His racing stud was the largest in"], [183, "ON THE BRINK. 175 England, and he passed his nights in clubs, where he gambled to a frightful extent. Perhaps he thought that she would be driven to apply to her father for assistance \u2014 and it did come to that at last, but not in the way, nor with the effect which he had probably anticipated. \" One day a money-lender, who had advanced Lord Tenby a very large sum of money, find ing that he could get neither principal nor interest, put an execution into the house in Eaton Square, just as Nelly was sitting down to her solitary dinner. She ordered a cab, and drove at once to Mr. Halsted's. She said she thought her father would have fallen down in a fit when she told him what had hap pened, and as soon as he recovered a little, he gave vent to his indignation in the strongest language. He did more than that however. He got into the cab and drove with his daughter to his solicitor's, and the three re turned to Eaton Square, where he made very short work of it. His solicitor proved, to the"], [184, "176 ON THE BRINK. satisfaction of the sheriff's officer, that the house and everything it contained belonged legally to Nelly's trustees. I never could understand how this could be, but I know that in half an hour the house was cleared of its unwelcome visitors. And then Mr. Halsted took measures for preventing* any future annoy ance falling upon Nelly on account of her husband's debts. The allowance which they received, not being secured by any legal docu ment, was entirely voluntary on the part of Mr. Halsted, and could be withdrawn at any moment. He now insisted upon paying half of it to his daughter, for the maintenance of their establishment, and with this, after some discussion, Lord Tenby found himself obliged to comply. So that in point of fact, though he lives in Eaton Square when he is in London, his wife is the sole mistress of the house and servants, as much as if she were not married. Even the carriages and horses which she uses are her own, bought with her own money, and kept at her expense."], [185, "ON THE BRINK. 177 \" But the most shocking event was yet to come. It was said that Lord Tenby was sus pected of doing unfair things in racing, and at length he was publicly accused of winning a race with a horse that wras only three years old, but which he said was four.\" \"Are you quite sure, Auntie,\" said Compton, interrupting her, \" that it was not exactly the reverse \u2014 that the horse was in reality four years old, when it ought to have been only three ?\" \"Very likely,\" Auntie replied. \"I know nothing about these things myself, but it was one or the other. And, my dear, the very jockeys talked of turning him out of their club, of which he was a member. Can you conceive anything so disgraceful ? That a gentleman should associate with such people, and belong to their club, is bad enough, but to be turned out of it for cheating is something too hor rible.\" Compton could not refrain from laughing. \" If, as I suspect,\" he said, \" you are talking of vol. i. N"], [186, "178 ON THE BRINK. the Jockey Club, some of its members are men of the highest rank and most unsullied honour.\" \"Mores the pity,\" Mrs. Thorpe replied. \"However, it appears nothing was proved against Lord Tenby. On investigation, the horse was found to be tho right age, aud then the accuser asserted that the horse which had been examined was not the one which had run ; that another horse had run under his name and had been spirited away. But it was decided that he had failed to make good his accusation, and Lord Tenby was acquitted. But Mr. Burnthwaite told me that public opinion was against him, and that many of his old friends and associates looked very coldly upon him. His general character was against him, no doubt.\" \" What most surprises me,\" remarked Comp ton, \"is that Lady Tenby should not have separated from him long ago. No one could have blamed her.\" \" She never would hear of it,\" Mrs. Thorpe replied. \" And if you reflect upon her position,"], [187, "ON THE BRINK. 179 you will see that it would have been hardly practicable. At her age she could not have lived alone, except in utter seclusion, and she would not have found a comfortable home at her father's ; Lady Miranda's society would have been more intolerable than ever ; and I do not think Mr. Halsted would have approved of it. No doubt, if Nelly had expressed a decided wish to return to his house, he would not have refused to take her in ; but such a public acknowledgment that all his plans for her success in life had come to nought would have been a severe mortification to him. The world would have laughed at the discomfiture of the rich banker, who had purchased so high a position for his daughter by the sacrifice of her happiness ; and no one is more sensitive to ridicule than Mr. Halsted.\" \"But, Auntie, she might have lived with you. \"That would have been as bad, in Mr. Halsted's eyes, or worse. I need not say that with me she would have found a home, but it"], [188, "180 ON THE BRINK. would not have suited either father or daughter. For you must not judge Lady Tenby by the little girl you knew at Longwater, though even there her character was beginning to form. Nelly has all her father's pride and courage. She is one to brave the storm, rather than to fly from it. And Nelly, our little Nelly, is ambitious. When she showed me the insolent and unmanly letter which her husband wrote her on the occasion of her adopting Hugh, she said, ' I will show Lord Tenby that I can acquire for myself a position in society equal to that which he derives from his birth,' and to that she has devoted all her energies. She laid herself out to charm the world, and she has succeeded. Not a very dignified pursuit, you will say, perhaps ; but she had no other, and better for her to have even such an occupation as that, than to pass her life in tears and solitude. Lady Tenby is now one of the high mightinesses from whom the world of fashion receives its laws, wdiose acquaintance confers distinction, whose intimacy"], [189, "ON THE BRINK. 181 is accepted as a proof of merit. Even Lady Miranda bows down before her supremacy. And all this has been accomplished by no loss of self-respect, but simply by tact and deter mination to succeed. Whatever difficulties she may have had to contend with at the out set have long since vanished, and her pre eminence is now universally accepted as an accomplished fact. It is true she had great assistance and valuable auxiliaries, but even these she owed to herself. Her mother-in-law, old Lady Tenby, took to her at once, and her example was followed by all her connections, and their name is legion. Of course they, as well as the rest of the world, were soon aware of Lord Tenby's treatment of his young wife ; indeed, he made no secret of it, but seemed rather to take a pride in defying the opinion of the world he outraged, and, perhaps, at first, they rather shrank from taking part on one side or the other. But when they found that no word of reproach or complaint against her husband ever fell from Nelly's lips, when it"], [190, "ON THE BRINK. 182 was clear that she had no intention of attempt- ing to enlist them as partisans in domestic warfare, they gave her their warmest support, short of coming to an open breach with Lord Tenby. Nelly is fond of society. She says it is all that is left her, and that she means to take her fill of it. Under the auspices of her new connections she soon had the command of the best that London affords, but she hardly ever went out alone. It was always under the wing of her mother-in-law, or some other person as much looked up to and respected. Lady Tenby, the dowager I mean, is a dear old lady. She made Nelly bring her here one day, and she sometimes calls for me to take me out in her carriage. She told me that on the first occasion of their going to some party together, my dear child said that she considered herself as completely under her chaperonage, 'And therefore,' she continued, ' I ask it as a favour, that if you ever see me do, or hear me say anything that you do not approve, you will tell me of it without"], [191, "ON THE BRINK. 183 ceremony.' ' And I should have done it too,' said the old lady, ' for I am perfectly certain she meant what she said. But I have never seen anything in her conduct that the most fastidious could condemn. She does credit to her early training, for I do not imagine that she owes much to Lady Miranda's precepts. Surely, my dear Mrs. Thorpe, she must reclaim Tenby at last.' \" \" I suppose that will be the end of it ?\" said Compton. \" I cannot say,\" Mrs. Thorpe replied. \" There are no signs of it at present, and I do not think it likely. Even if it were to take place, I much doubt if it would add to her comfort or happiness. She could never forget the past. Her grievances rankle all the more, that she so studiously avoids all mention of them to others. My dear, she despises him, and that is a feeling which will never be eradicated. And yet she shields his honour as well as she can. At the time of that dreadful racing business old Lady Tenby went to her in great"], [192, "184 ON THE BRINK distress, and AsKed what they were all to do. It was in every newspaper, and the subject of general conversation, and she really felt ashamed of showing her face in public. Nelly was indignant. She said that for her part she did not believe a word of the story, and that it was their duty to face the calumny and crush it. Then she added that she had spoken to Lord Windermere on the subject on the preceding evening, and he had assured her that it was most likely the invention of some one who had lost his money, and thought that the best means to avoid paying it was to ac- cuse the winner of fraud. And Nelly was as good as her word. She made a point of show- ing herself everywhere. She never shrank from discussing the subject with any one whom she thought might be of use ; and I really be lieve that her exertions had a great deal to do with the successful issue of the inquiry. Every one pitied her ; and no doubt there were many who were willing to stretch a point to save Lord Tenby from a disgrace which must"], [193, "ON THE BRINK 185 necessarily be reflected upon his wife and family. I have never been able to make out if Nelly believed in his guilt or not. It was not a subject upon which I could question her. \" Notwithstanding the extreme circumspec tion of her conduct, the poor child has been more than once exposed to some disagreeable scenes. Amongst others, Mr. De Lacy told her one evening that he hoped she was now convinced that she would have done much better to have accepted him.\" \" The insolent blackguard !\" exclaimed Compton. \" What did Nelly, what did Lady Tenby say ?\" \" Oh, Nelly is seldom at a loss for an answer. She told him that, on the contrary, what he had just said convinced her more than ever of the wisdom of her decision ; and that as she did not admire such speeches, she desired that he would never presume to address her again in such a style. Since then they are hardly on speaking terms. And now, my dear Arthur, I have told you all.\""], [194, "186 ON THE BRINK. \"Too much, Auntie, too much. Poor Nelly ! poor, clear little Nelly ! how you must have suffered !\" \" She has indeed. And yet you must not suppose that she is altogether unhappy. At times, no doubt, she feels her desolate position acutely, but she is used to it now, and has made up her mind to bear with patience that for which there is no remedy. She knows that it is through no fault of hers that she has been brought to this state ; and, having nothing to reproach herself with, she is the better able to endure it with cheerfulness and resignation. Neither in mind, heart, nor person, has she suffered from the struggle. Her beauty is still as fresh as it was at the time of her mar riage, her intellect is as clear, her judgment as sound as ever ; she has perfect self-control, and never says anything she would wish unsaid. Her feelings towards those she loves are as warm as when you first knew her, without an atom of false pride. Auntie always receives an invitation to her parties, and I did go twice"], [195, "ON THE BRINK. 187 to her concerts, where the best place in the room was assigned me, in the midst of all the finest ladies in London, much wondering, no doubt, who I was, and how I got amongst them.\" \" And Mr. Halsted,\" asked Compton. \" How does he take it ?\" \" Not as well as his daughter. How can he, when he must be aware that it was all his doing? He must remember that she trusted herself entirely to his judgment, and how has her confidence been repaid ! I am convinced he feels most acutely the fate he has brought upon her. He is much aged in the last five years, and has a very careworn appearance. It is true, so Mr. Burnthwaite tells me, that he devotes himself to business more diligently than ever, as if he wished, by constant occu pation, to get rid of all uneasy thoughts ; and this increase of work must tell upon him, for he is no longer young.\" \"Well, Auntie,\" said Compton, \"you have told me a verv sad storv. It seems almost"], [196, "188 ON THE BRINK. like a dream, to find my little sister so high in one sense, so low in another. But it is near twelve, too late for any further discussion to night, though I have many questions to ask. I feel really ashamed of having kept you up so late.\" \" I am not very regular in my hours,\" Mrs. Thorpe replied. \" Nelly often looks in upon me nearly as late as this, in all her finery, on her way to some ball or party. Hardly a day passes on wThich she does not contrive to see me, if it be but for a few minutes.\" \" Yes,\" Compton rejoined, \" I see she is un changed, unspoiled by contact with the wrorld. But what has become of Hugh ? Lady Tenby told me that you give him a bed, and I want to know if I am to expect him to dine with me to-morrow. At what hour does he re turn ?\" \"Hugh is probably in bed and asleep. I heard him come in hours ago, and when he was told that I had a visitor with me, no doubt"], [197, "ON THE BRINK. 189 he went up to his own room.

Your welcome has made me feel that I have still one warm-hearted friend in Eng land.\" \" One, Arthur ! If you think you have not another in Nelly, you do not do her justice. You should have seen the eagerness with which she used to read out to me any article in the papers in which your name was mentioned. We used to call you our hero. And when we saw that you had volunteered to go to Kars, we fully expected that you would have come on to England as soon as peace was re-esta blished. It was a bitter disappointment to both of us, when we beard that you had returned to India.\" \" And to me, too, I assure you,\" Compton rejoined. \"But I could not obtain leave, and was obliged to rejoin my regiment at once.\""], [198, "190 ON THE BRINK. Very slowly the colonel walked home that night to his hotel. His mind was assailed by so many different sensations, such various and contradictory thoughts, that he found it impos- sible to dwell on any of them for long. Intense pity for her, whose happiness, had it been intrusted to his care, he would have guarded as the apple of his eye, was at one moment the predominant feeling. Then it was replaced by a sentiment of abhorrence amounting to hatred for Lord Tenby. Ah, had he indeed been Nelly's brother, had he been authorized by any tie of near relationship to espouse her cause, could he in any way have taken up her quarrel without compromising her name, to what a se- vere account would he have called the destroyer of her happiness ! Nor did he fail to inflict a severe mental castigation on Mr. Halsted, for the culpable indifference he had shown for the character of the man to whom he had entrusted his daughter's welfare. He knew Lord Tenby to be extravagant and profligate, but he had escaped exposure, and Mr. Halsted was satis-"], [199, "ON THE BRINK. 191 fied. The vices of his intended son-in-law were trifles light as air when weighed against a countess's coronet, with the prospect of a ducal one at no distant period. And then he asked himself what could be done to rescue the sister of his adoption from the position, into which she had been betrayed by the reckless ambition of her father and the ostentatious depravity of her husband. How could he best serve her ? She had said that she depended upon his friendship ; what could he do to prove that he was not unworthy of the trust reposed in him ? And the answer was, \"Nothing.\" He was utterly powerless to assist her. Not even by advice, if indeed in such a case advice could have been of any use ; for, by Mrs. Thorpe's account, Lady Tenby had long ago come to a decision upon her line of conduct, and acted up to it. Nor did he find fault with the system she had adopted. Few women of her age, perhaps, would have had the courage to face the world, and expose themselves to its comments under such circum-"], [200, "192 ON THE BRINK. stances, but it was probably the best course she could have pursued. She had no family connections of her own to whom she could appeal for support, and had she shut herself up in privacy and seclusion, she would have left the field open to her husband, who would have put what colouring he pleased upon her pro ceedings. Now she could safely defy criticism, come from what quarter it might. She had thrown herself upon the judgment of the world, and the world had given its verdict in her favour. She courted publicity, for she had done nothing that she wished to conceal ; and she lived with all the more security in this glass house of hers, that she was not in the habit of throwing stones at others. Compton went to bed anything but satisfied with the result of his self-communings. For Lady Tenby herself he could do nothing. The only way in which he could prove his desire to serve her was by holding out a helping hand to her protege, Hugh Graham, and that he determined to do to the best of his abilitv."], [201, "ON THE BRINK. 193 Hugh was the only link that seemed to con nect them at present. How different from the happy days they had passed together in West moreland, when Nelly's childish affection had thrown a charm over his existence, which neither time, nor distance, nor the stirring events in the midst of which the last years of his life had been passed, had ever obliterated from his memory. What would he not have given to bring back those days again ! Nelly had told him that she at least was unchanged. Her feelings towards him were still the same. She could avow them without hesitation or shame ; they were those of a sister for a brother. But his ! He could not, or would not, give them a name. He did not care to analyze them too closely. It was but natural that his thoughts should revert to the cause of all this misery, with a feeling of detestation. He persuaded himself that it sprung solely from indignation at Lord Tenby's heartless conduct to his wife ; but had he dived into the recesses of his heart, it is vol. i. o"], [202, "194 ON THE RRINK. possible he might have detected another motive. He might have found lurking there some traces of jealousy, or at least of envy, mitigated, indeed, by the thought that Nelly had not found with another the happiness she might have found with him.

Hugh Graham dined with him, and they w*ent to the theatre to gether, but the boy was at first so shy and reserved, that Compton did not find it as easy as he had expected to insinuate himself into his confidence. He did not seem to have formed any plans for his future career in life. Like most lads of his age, what predilections he had were in favour of the army, and these his entertainer set himself to combat by every means in his power. He represented to him"], [204, "196 ON THE BRINK. the uncertainty, the slowness of promotion, the difficulty, not to say impossibility, of living on the pay, for those who have no private re sources ; and the probability that when he retired from the service it would be with ruined health, premature old age, and a heart soured with disappointment. \" But surely, Colonel Compton,\" said Hugh, \"you have no right to talk of disappoint ment.\" \" Oh, there are exceptions, no doubt, and I am one of them ; but then I am an extra ordinary instance of good fortune. As soon as I arrived in India I was taken by the hand by General Roden, a connection of my mother's, who had served in the same regi ment with my father, and entertained a warm regard for his memory. Then I was favoured by circumstances which are never likely to occur again, for a long series of years at least. And to show you how right I am, there are at this moment two officers, who entered the service at the same time that I did, and who"], [205, "ON THE BRINK. 197 are still only lieutenants, from no fault of theirs certainly. And mind you, I am speak ing of the Company's service, which was on a far better footing, as regards promotion and emolument, than the Queen's army.

Would Lady Tenby approve of it? I think you are bound to consider her wishes a little, and I do not imagine she would wish you to adopt a profession which would necessarily entail long and frequent separations. At all events, you ought to consult her before coming to a decision. She has bestowed on you the care and affection of a mother ; you owe her the duty of a son.

I am sure she will only advise me for my good.\" \" Yes ; of that you may be quite certain,\" replied Compton, much pleased with the good feeling shown by his companion. This con versation, moreover, bad broken the ice, and the thaw continued. They went to the play, which Hugh enjoyed with the zest of one to whom such amusements were but of rare occurrence. When the performance was over, before entering the cab which was to take him home, he shook hands with Compton with great warmth, and thanked him most cordially for his kindness. The colonel had evidently made great progress in his good graces. It was not till late on the following after noon that Compton again presented himself in Eaton Square, and he found the room full of visitors, who succeeded each other in rapid succession. He had not much opportunity of speaking to Lady Tenby, but she at once"], [207, "ON THE BRINK. 199 made it clear upon what footing she intended him to be in her house, by presenting him to some of her intimates as one of her oldest friends. She found time to tell him that Hugh had been enchanted with his evening, and that she much wished to talk over his future prospects. \" But,\" she con tinued, \"you must come to me before two o'clock, if you wish to find me alone. I have added your name to the list of the very few whom I admit as morning visitors, and I hope you will value the privilege as it deserves.\" He felt that he should only value it too much, and determined to avail himself of it but sparingly. One conversation he must necessarily have with her on the subject of her protege, and in his wisdom he decided that the sooner it was over the better. Accordingly, he called on her in the course of a day or two, at the time she had indicated. He found her alone, as he had expected, and began at once upon the business that had brought him there. He could not refrain from relating to her all"], [208, "200 ON THE BRINK. that had passed between Hugh and himself, and dwelt with great earnestness upon the readiness he had shown to give up his ow*n wishes at the first hint that they might be in opposition to those of his benefactress. \" He is a dear, good boy,\" she said, \"and you can scarcely wonder at the affection I feel for him. I am glad however that you spoke to him as you did, for certainly I have very strong objections to his entering the army. Not so much for myself, though I confess it would be a grievous trial to me to part with him, as because I think it would be attended by many disadvantages to himself and others. In the army he would be a sort of public character, and of course inquiries would be made as to who he is. This would be painful to him, and very annoying to Lord Tenby. Now I have no wish to give Lord Tenby any annoyance that can possibly be avoided. At present Hugh's birth is a secret known but to few, and there is no necessity for publishing it to the world at large. We will therefore put"], [209, "ON THE BRINK. 201 the army on one side at once. But there are many other professions by which a gentleman may live. Which do you recommend ?\" \"My first recommendation is, that Hugh should take part in the discussion.

If you are not in a hurry, I will send for him to my aunt's.\" Compton assured her that his time was entirely at her disposal, and a servant was dis patched to summon the object of their consulta tion. A short silence ensued, which was broken by Compton. \" I have not seen you alone,\" he said, \"since my visit to Mrs. Thorpe.

Should you incline to it, I might be able to assist you, for I am very intimate with the engineer who was in charge of one of our Indian railways. He is now in England.

Hugh vanished, and Compton rose to depart. \" I wish, Arthur,\" said Lady Tenby, \" the first time you are in the city you would call on my father. He much wishes to see you, and indeed suggested that I should ask you to meet him at dinner here to-morrow. He will be disappointed, I know, when he finds you cannot come, and vou must settle with him some day for dining here.\""], [214, "ON THE BRINK. 206 \" I am going to my own banker's now, and will call on him on my way. As for the invitation you are good enough to give me, I shall have much pleasure in accepting it for any day that may be most convenient to you and Mr. Halsted.\" \" Now, Arthur, you are relapsing into your cold, formal manner, and you have been so kind, so patient about poor Hugh, so like the Arthur of Longwater, that it is more than ever detestable and out of place. I positively will not allow it. And now tell me, when shall I see you again ?\" He could not very well announce to her, in so many words, that he had determined to see as little of her as possible. While he was still hesitating, the door opened, and the new comer was announced. She had just time to say, \" The day after to-morrow, then. Remem ber, I shall expect you.\" Compton jumped into a cab, annoyed at Lady Tenby's pertinacious attempts to renew their intimacy, and angry with himself for not"], [215, "ON THE BRINK. 207 having had some courteous phrase in readiness, with which to repress them. Occupied with these thoughts, he was deposited at Mr. Halsted's bank before he had time to wonder at that gentleman's anxiety to see him. As soon as his name was announced, he was ushered into the sanctum sanctorum, where he found the banker alone. For a moment they looked at each other with mutual curiosity. The sUence was broken by the colonel, who said that he had taken the liberty of calling on Mr. Halsted by Lady Tenby's request, as it would be out of his power to dine in Eaton Square on the following day. \"I am very sorry to hear it,\" said Mr. Halsted, with great cordiality, \"but I feel really obliged to you for having taken the trouble of coming to announce it yourself, and thus giving me the opportunity of making your acquaintance. Naturally, I wished to know one of whom I have heard so much, and of whom my daughter thinks so highly. But I have a more interested motive. The fact is,"], [216, "208 ON THE BRINK. Colonel Compton, I am largely interested in some of the new Indian railways. The reports we have received are far from satisfactory, and I thought it not impossible that you might be able to give me some information on the subject yourself, or at least to put me in communication with some one who can.\" \" I shall be most happy,\" Compton replied, \" to give you all the information in my power, which is not much ; but I can introduce you to Mr. Collins, a friend of mine, from whom I have no doubt you will learn everything you wish to know. He is quite at the head of his profession as an engineer, and has had a good deal to do with Indian railways. In addition to this, he is thoroughly trustworthy. I do not mean only as a man of honour, but as a man of sound judgment, who sees thino-s as they are, not as they might be, or ought to be. In fact, but for him, 1 might have lost the few hundreds I can call my own.\" \" How so ?\" Mr. Halsted asked, \" if I am not taking too great a liberty.\""], [217, "ON THE BRINK. 209 \" Not at all. It is no secret, and after all it is a very simple matter ; one that occurs every day. I was induced to invest some money I had at my disposal in the shares of a railway company which certainly held out most tempting prospects, and which I still believe, under good management, might answer in the long run. I was even offered a seat as a director, and was more than half inclined to accept, when my good angel threw Collins in my way. I had had it in my power to do some trifling service to a sister of his, married and settled in India, and I suppose he thought it a good occasion for showing his gratitude. He told me that he had refused to have any thing to do with it himself, and he proved to me in the most satisfactory manner that the whole thing must end in failure. The line had not been properly surveyed, in fact, great part of it had never been surveyed at all ; the works, as far as they went, had been constructed in a most inefficient manner, and at the same time with the most reckless disregard of vol. 1. p"], [218, "210 ON THE BRINK. economy ; and, what startled me most, was that he assured me that he knew from the fountain head that the government guarantee, which the directors loudly proclaimed they were on the point of obtaining, had been applied for and refused. In short, Collins went so far as to assert that the directors, the contractors, and their bankers, were a gang of swindlers, in league to defraud the public. I got out of the concern as fast as I could. The ugliest part of the business was that it was through the representations of the bankers of the company, who were also my own, that I had embarked in the concern. Collins went with me to them, and fairly bullied them, by threats of exposure, into buying the shares back of me. I suffered a trifling loss, but was only- too glad to get out of it so well.\" \" May I ask the name of the line ?\" said Mr. Halsted. \" Oh, it has a splendid title. ' The Great West of Asia.' ': A shade passed across Mr. Halsted's face, but he made no observation,"], [219, "ON THE BRINK. 211 and Compton continued. \" If ever it is carried out it will connect Delhi and Bagdad, whence it is to run through the heart of Asia Minor to Scutari, with branch lines in every direction. About three thousand five hundred miles ; capital, fifty millions. That I call something like a railroad. I confess I was captivated by the magnificence of the project.\" \" And you think now,\" said the banker, \" that it cannot succeed ?\" \"Not under the present management, cer tainly. It might with a new board ; but they would have to begin everything over again. The shareholders must make up their minds to the loss of the money already expended on it, and that no doubt amounts to a large sum. The preliminary expenses must have been enormous ; and even when completed, I do not see how it is to pay, for many years, at all events. In time, as civilization progresses, it probably would, and largely ; but if you invest in it, it will be for the sake of your great grandchildren, not your own.\""], [220, "212 ON THE BRINK. \" I am not likely to have great-grandchildren to make investments for,\" replied Mr. Halsted, bitterly. \" Colonel Compton, by your account Mr. Collins seems to me to be the very man I am in search of. I should esteem it a great favour if you can introduce me to him.\" \" Nothing easier, my dear sir. He is gone into Hertfordshire for a week ; as soon as he returns, suppose you come and dine with him at my hotel, and if I am in the way, you can make some future appointment with him. One caution I must give you. He has taken a cottage somewhere near Blackheath, and I advise you on no account to visit him there. He is making experiments in gun-cotton, and I expect the whole concern to be blown up some fine day.\" \"Thank you for your invitation and your warning. It would not suit me at all to be blown up just at present,\" said Mr. Halsted, smiling for the first time. \" And now, Colonel Compton,\" he continued, going to a safe and unlocking it, \"I have a restitution to make."], [221, "ON THE BRINK. 213 These two letters were written to you by Eleanor, some time after she came to reside under my roof. The name of Compton was unknown to me, and I wished my daughter to lose sight of her old associations. I took upon myself to suppress them, but they are yours now, to read or burn at your pleasure. You will observe that the seals are unbroken.\" Compton put out his hand for them, and received them in silence. \" You think I was not justified in detaining them ?\" Mr. Halsted observed. \"Pardon me. I think that a father has every right to regulate his daughter's corre spondence, particularly at that early age. I was only thinking that if you had written to me yourself, explaining your wishes, and stating what you had done, it would have spared me some uneasiness.\" \" Yes, I might have done so, no doubt, and indeed I did think of it. But I could not very well have avoided making known to you the identity of Nelly Thorpe with Miss Halsted,"], [222, "214 ON THE BRINK and that I did not wish to do. Nor did I think that a young man in active service in India would much care for the letters of a little girl in England. I do not think I did wrong. If you think so, forgive me, for I certainly had no intention of giving you pain.\" \" My dear Mr. Halsted, pray say no more. You cannot suppose for a moment that there is any necessity for asking* my forgiveness for doing what you had a perfect right to do. I suppose, when Collins comes to town, I may arrange your meeting as soon as I can.\" \" Certainly ; and I thank you again for so kindly acceding to my wishes. While parlia ment is sitting, I accept no invitations that I cannot give up at a moment's notice ; so he has only to name his own day.\" Instead of going on to his own banker's, Compton returned home. He was too impa tient to read Nelly's letters to think of business. Both had been written soon after her arrival in London, within a month of each other, and told him nothing that he had not already heard"], [223, "ON THE BRINK. 215 from Mrs. Thorpe. They were simply the productions of a half-educated girl, slightly sprinkled with orthographical errors, and written in a hand more remarkable for the boldness of its vagaries than for its elegance. But they were evidently inspired by thorough confidence in the sympathy of him to whom they were addressed, giving him the most minute details of her daily life, of her aunt's affliction, the awe in which she stood of her father, her dislike of Lady Miranda, her detes tation of Miss Skinner, and the discomfort of her position in general. Nor were they want ing in expressions of the warmest affection for her dear, kind brother Arthur, and hopes that he would soon be able to leave that horrid India, and return to the friends who loved him. Compton kissed them more than once as he proceeded, and could scarcely refrain from tears as he did so, so vividly did they recall the remembrance of the happiest days of his life, days which he could never hope to see renewed."], [224, "216 ON THE BRINK. He fell into a fit of musing on what had been, and what was, not without some anxiety as to what the future might have in store for him, and he derived but small comfort from his reflections. He did not long indulge in them, however. He was essentially a man of action, in mind and body, with the happy power of concentrating his attention upon any subject to which he chose to direct it. Feeling how worse than unprofitable were all these linger ing longings for a past which was gone for ever, he sat down resolutely to prepare a report upon the military system of the Indian government, for which Lord Margate had asked him. It was a more arduous task than he had anticipated, but he devoted to it the whole of that evening and the next day, and completed it in time to take with him to dinner. Thus occupied, he had not had time to give more than a passing thought to Lady Tenby, and it was not till he woke on the following morning that he recollected the sort of appointment she had made with him. True, he had not ac-"], [225, "ON THE BRINK. 217 cepted it, and was not bound by it. He might, if he so pleased, take no notice of it ; but then, in all probability she had taken his silence for consent, and in that case she might feel justly offended by his neglect. Or he might write to her, and plead important business as an excuse for his absence ; but unfortunately it so hap pened, that on that particular day he had no business to attend to, important or otherwise, and he shrank from having recourse to a down right falsehood. Even in trifles he had a great respect for truth, and never had he felt less inclined to violate her precepts. In short, he must go, as he might be considered to have given a sort of tacit assent, but he would only go at an hour when he was pretty sure of find ing others there besides himself. A tete-a-tete he would avoid, and he would take very good care never to be entrapped into one again. Accordingly it was near four o'clock when he again found himself knocking at Lady Tenby's door, and he noticed with great satisfaction a carriage waiting before it. When he was"], [226, "218 ON THE BRINK. shown into the drawing room he found Lady Tenby with her bonnet on, and another lady with her, both on the point of going out. \" How tiresome of you, Colonel Compton, to come at this hour,\" exclaimed Lady Tenby, \" when you know I expected you hours ago. I had quite given you up, and I hope you come prepared with some excellent excuse, if you wish to be forgiven. But first, let me present you to Lady Windermere, whom you so civilly refused to meet at dinner yesterday.\" \" Whom I was so unfortunately prevented from meeting,\" said the colonel. \" Well, we will say no more about yesterday . You will have quite enough to do to explain your conduct to-day. If you are not in a hurry, Cecilia, we will give him five minutes for his justification. If he cannot prove his innocence in that time, it must be because the consciousness of guilt weighs him clown.\" \" I am afraid we are a little late as it is,\" said Lady Windermere ; \" but ,\" and she whispered something into her friend's ear."], [227, "ON THE BRINK. 219 \" Capital !\" exclaimed Lady Tenby, clapping her hands. \" But you must propose it your self. And make him promise first, as I used to do in the good old times.\" \" That would be throwing an imputation on Colonel Compton's good nature,\" said Lady Windermere. \" The fact is,\" she continued, turning to Compton, \" w-e are going to a break fast at the Duke of Lowestoft's, at Richmond, and have uo one to escort us there, unless you will take pity on us. The duke is a near con nection of mine, and I have full permission to ask any one I please. We will take you there and bring you back, and you will have plenty of time to defend yourself from Eleanor's accusations en route.\" Again Compton found himself without a ready answer. He was casting about for one, when Lady Tenby asked him if he had any engagement for that evening. He was obliged to confess that he had none. \"Then you can have no possible excuse for refusing,\" she said. \" And if you do I shall"], [228, "220 ON THE BRINK. really begin to think you have taken an antipathy to me.\" What could he do? He could not allow her to imbibe such an idea as that, and when he looked at her he saw how anxious she was for his acceptance. \"I am quite at your orders,\" he said. She rewarded him with a sunny smile. They started, and he was surprised to find how much he enjoyed himself. It was a delightful afternoon, warm, genial, summer weather, and with two pleasant companions the drive only seemed too short. His spirits rose, and he made himself very agreeable. He soon found out that Lady Windermere was acquainted with the history of his first acquaintance with Nelly, and this put him quite at his ease with her. He almost felt that she, too, was an old friend. It is true the party itself rather bored him. He hardly knew any one to speak to, and he carefully avoided all appearance of attaching himself to Lady Tenby. His sole indemnification was being introduced to Lord"], [229, "ON THE BRINK. 221 Windermere, who joined them in the course of the evening, and who seemed to be quite as much out of his element as he was himself. \" I do not know what your opinion of this sort of thing is, Colonel Compton,\" he said, \" but for my part I detest it. My sister-in-law, Lady Henry Langley, made such a point of ray coming that I was obliged to comply, though what good it can do her I have no idea. By the bye, I believe you have but just returned from India. I wish you would explain to me \" and thereupon they fell into a long discussion on Indian affairs. Lord Windermere returned with them to town. \" Do you smoke, Colonel Compton ?\" he asked, holding out a cigar-case. \" Lady Win dermere allows it in the dark, and I know Lady Tenby has no objection.\" \" No, indeed,\" said the last-named lady. \" I was broken into it in the days of my youth by a gentleman of my acquaintance, who was never without a cigar in his mouth.\" Compton returned to his hotel in a state of"], [230, "222 ON THE BRINK. great perplexity, pleased with his evening, not altogether satisfied with himself, and yet unable to see how he could have acted other wise. He could not even determine whether he had done right or wrong in accepting an invitation to meet Lady Tenby at dinner at the Windermeres'."], [231, "ON THE BRINK. 223 CHAPTER X. Comptox's waking thoughts took another turn. He had done all in his power to avoid a renewal of his intimacy with Nelly when he found that she was already a wife, but circum- stances seemed determined to force that inti- macy upon him. He had struggled with fate, and fate had been too strong for him. Why should he struggle further ? and, after all, what object was to be gained even if he succeeded in persuading Lady Tenby to consider him only in the light of a common acquaintance. He could not, he did not, attempt to conceal from himself that the love he felt for her every day assumed a more intense character ; but it was"], [232, "224 ON THE BRINK. absurd to suppose that at his age he could not obtain command over his feelings sufficient to confine them to his own breast. If he had been able to conceal them when Lady Tenby appealed to his affection, while still surprised and agitated by the sudden disclosure of her identity, how much easier would it be for him now that he was prepared and armed ! Not only would he bury his love in his own heart, but, if he wished to regain his peace of mind, he must do his best to conquer it. And what would be the best way of accomplishing this ? Certainly not by acts of discourtesy, by as suming a morose or surly manner, or even by throwing unnecessary obstacles in the way of their intercourse. All this would but serve to irritate his passion, and keep his thoughts per petually fixed upon the object of it. And how deeply would poor Nelly feel hurt by such un natural, such insulting conduct. No; the rational way of effecting a cure was frankly to accept her advances in the same spirit in which she made them. She felt for him the"], [233, "ON THE BRINK. 225 the affection of a sister, and nothing more. No doubt he would soon imbibe the same feelings, and learn to look upon her in the same fight. His mind would then be at peace, his con science void of offence. Such was his train of reasoning on his own behalf; but it is only justice to say that Nelly's welfare occupied a large part of his thoughts. The more he saw of her the more deeply did he commiserate her position. He felt that she had only spoken the truth when she said that she stood in need of a friend. With the excep tion of her father, whose every moment was engrossed by business, and of Auntie, who was powerless to help her, who was there on whom she could rely in the hour of trial and distress ? He, and he alone, the adopted brother who had so often promised to befriend her, and on whose friendship she had an undoubted claim. Who could say how soon the case might occur, and if he stood aloof, how could he discharge the duties which she had a right to expect from him ? Even if her companionship were the vol. i. Q"], [234, "226 ON THE BRINK. means of inflicting on him additional pain and mortification, he had no right to shrink from it. His troubles were his own, and he would meet them as he best might ; but hers at all events he would endeavour to alleviate, if he could not cure. Then again it struck him how absurd it would be if, after so many years' absence from England, he returned to it only to shut himself up in morbid seclusion, to brood over a state of things which no human power could alter. He was no misanthropist, and although his chequered career had not afforded him many opportunities of mixing in society, he w*as very far from undervaluing its attractions. He had now an opportunity of entering upon the busy scene under the best auspices. When he emerged from his bath, with his body braced and his mind strengthened, it was with a determination to take the good the gods pro vided for him. In pursuance of this resolution, as soon as the clock struck twelve he presented himself at"], [235, "ON THE BRINK. Lady Tenby's door, and was received by her in a manner which proved how ready she was to forward his newly-formed plans. \" If I thought,\" she said, \" that I should not be exposing myself to a refusal, I would offer you an invitation for a ball, to which I am going to-night, and to which I can ask any one I like.\" \" Try me,\" was the reply. From that time he threw himself completely into the vortex, and even found means of repairing the defects of his education as regarded the science of dancing. There were few evenings in which he did not meet Lady Tenby, there were few mornings in which he did not find time to pay her a visit, but so guarded was he in his manner, so little desirous, apparently, of monopolizing her, so ready to give up his place, when seated near her, to any new comer, that his unobtrusive attentions altogether escaped notice. Yet, if wanted, he was always at his post, the invisible mantle of his protection was always ready to be thrown"], [236, "228 ON THE BRINK. over her in case of need. And she too felt intuitively that a change had taken place in the daily routine of her existence. What had caused it she could not say, but life seemed to have acquired a new interest for her ; and if she still persevered with unabated ardour in her round of dissipation, she was now animated by something more than the mere pursuit of pleasure. Compton did not allow the new system which he had adopted to make him forgetful of his more serious engagements. Mr. Collins had returned to town, and offered to take Hugh Graham into his own office as soon as he was sixteen, without a premium. The young gentleman himself had gone back to school, and for the next two years his studies were to be more particularly directed to qualifying him for the profession he had selected. Then Mr. Halsted was introduced to the engineer, and had more than one long conference with him. Collins told the colonel in confidence that, from what he could make out, he feared"], [237, "ON THE BRINK. 229 the banker was very deeply involved in the Great West of Asia, the identical railway from which Compton had escaped, not without burning his fingers a little. \" However,\" said Collins, \"with his immense wealth, I do not imagine it can be of any great consequence to him, and it will teach him not to meddle in future with things he does not understand.\" Compton heard this with great concern. By some strange elective affinity, Wahlverwand schaft, as our German cousins would call it, these two men, seemingly so totally different, the banker and the soldier, had contracted a great regard for each other. On the part of Mr. Halsted this perhaps was not so surprising. He found in his new acquaintance all those qualities combined which he most valued. Good, sound, practical common sense, courage, resolution, and integrity, and what he certainly appreciated quite as much, a successful career in the great battle of life, at once the proof and the reward of merit. He had long known Compton by name. Since her marriage Lady"], [238, "230 ON THE BRINK. Tenby had been much more confidential in her communications with her father than she had ever been before, and by degrees he became acquainted with every particular of her early life. Naturally the episode of Leo, and her in timacy with her brother Arthur, as she always called him, had not been forgotten. Nelly delighted in expatiating on his merits and perfections, and the many happy hours they had passed together, till at last Mr. Halsted began to take an interest himself in the young soldier, who, apparently unaided, was working his way to distinction by his own exertions. He thought that, if his own son had been spared, he too might have been such another, and this idea was accompanied by a kindliness of feeling towards that son's imaginary proto type. Even while still unknown to him, except by name, he could not look upon Nelly's adopted brother entirely- in the light of a stranger. The case was different with Compton. Mrs. Thorpe's statement had not prepossessed him"], [239, "ON THE BRINK. 231 in Mr. Halsted's favour. He expected to find in him a man of coarse, abrupt, and over bearing manners, with all the arrogance and self-sufficiency which wealth is but too apt to engender in the minds of those, who have made it the sole pursuit of their lives. He was most agreeably surprised when he found himself in the presence of one whose whole bearing, without having any pretensions to ultra-refinement, was that of a gentleman. His surprise was increased by the cordiality of his reception, and he could not but respect the honourable feeling which had induced Mr. Halsted to put Nelly's letters into his hand, and boldly acknowledge a rather questionable stretch of prerogative, which most men would have been content to pass over in silence. Compton visited the Halsteds more than once, and had the good fortune to find favour in the eyes of Lady Miranda, who even claimed him as a connection, by virtue of some inter marriage between the De Lacy and Comp tons in the dark ages, to which the memory"], [240, "232 ON THE BRINK of man runneth not. By degrees he seemed to be accepted as a member of the family ; even De Lacy went the length of offering to propose him at one or two clubs. It was there fore with feelings of real sorrow and anxiety that he heard that Mr. Halsted was involved in pecuniary transactions with a body of men so little trustworthy as the directors of the Great West of Asia. And now that his attention was called to the subject, it struck him that the banker's manners were much altered during the short time that had elapsed since their first meeting. Even in his own house, Mr. Halsted was not much of a talker, but he always dispensed his hospitalities with a hearty cheerfulness, which, better than words, spoke a welcome to his guests. Compton now fancied that latterly his demeanour, though courteous as ever, bore evident traces of anxiety and care. There was one personage in the domestic circle with whom Colonel Compton was still unacquainted \u2014 Lord Tenby \u2014 and it is not"], [241, "ON THE BRINK. 233 easy to say which was the greatest \u2014 curiosity to see him, or repugnance at the idea of being brought into contact with him. One evening Compton was to dine early at Lady Tenby's, with the Windermeres and Lord and Lady Henry Langley, after which they were all to go to the Princess's ; and, as he piqued himself upon his punctuality, he arrived in Eaton Square some minutes before the rest of the party. Even the mistress of the house had not yet made her appearance when he was shown into the drawing-room ; but in her place he found a gentleman whom he now saw for the first time, apparently about forty years of age, though in reality he was younger, with a singularly high-bred and pleasing expression on his well-formed features, though with an air of languor, which seemed the effect of ill health. \" Colonel Compton,\" said the stranger, coming forward, \" as Lady Tenby is not present to perform that office for me, I must introduce myself to you as Lord Tenby, and permit me"], [242, "234 ON THE BRINK. to congratulate myself on making your ac quaintance beneath my own roof. I arrived from Paris not an hour ago.\" Compton was so taken by surprise that he could only mutter out something, in which the words honour and pleasure were alone audible. \"Are you aware, Colonel Compton,\" con tinued his lordship, \"that I feel almost entitled to claim you as an old friend ? I have heard so much of you from my brother-in-law, Sir William Claremont. He says he can never forget, or hope to repay your kindness and attention at the time of my poor sister's death, and he particularly charged me to show you every attention in my power, in case I ever came across you.\" \" Oh, my lord,\" said Compton, who by this time had recovered his self-possession, \" my very trifling services to Sir William at the time of his great affliction were but a small in stalment of the debt of gratitude I owed to him and Lady Margaret. When I was fairly down"], [243, "ON THE BRINK. 235 with the jungle fever they both tended me as if I had been one of their own family. But I was not aware that Lady Margaret was your lordship's sister.\" \"Yes, my eldest sister. Poor Margaret! She ought not to have gone out to India. We all remonstrated, but she would accompany her husband. What has become of the children ? A boy and a girl, I think.\" \" Yes. They came over under my care, and I took them down to their grandmother at Brighton.\" \" And how is Claremont ? It is some time since I have heard from him.\" \" Quite well in health. He is now, as no doubt you know, a major-general, and when I left India \" At this moment Lady Tenby entered the room. \" I see you have already made acquain tance with Lord Tenby, Colonel Compton,\" she said. \" Have you succeeded in getting us good stalls, and all together ?\" \" You are going to the theatre, are you ?\""], [244, "236 ON THE BRINK. said Lord Tenby. \"If I was not so tired with my journey I would go too.\" No answer was made to this observation, and the other guests arrived. Lady Henry Langley fell to Compton to take down to dinner. \" When did that horrid man arrive ?\" she whispered. But for all that, she had to sit next to the horrid man, and before long was engaged in an animated conversation with him. She could hardly be accused of inconsistency, for after all she could not well refuse to answer him when he addressed her, and undoubtedly Lord Tenby was a most agreeable companion, full of anecdote and gossip, and talking well. When Compton took an opportunity of com menting upon the seeming contradiction be tween her words and actions, she acknow ledged it very frankly. \" Somehow he amuses me, and makes me laugh in spite of myself,\" she said; \"but I dislike him all the more for it, for he makes me feel a contempt for myself.\""], [245, "ON THE BRINK. 237 Lord Tenby's manner to his wife was per fectly courteous and well-bred. It really seemed as if he was not aware, or had forgotten that the state of their domestic relations was well known to those present, and thought that he could throw dust in their eyes by an out ward show of deference and respect to her, whom he was daily and hourly outraging by his conduct. But his efforts were in vain. No one was deceived by them, and they obtained no response from Lady Tenby. She was too honest to feign feelings which did not exist ; least of all could she have played the hypocrite before Compton. In the course of conversation her husband expatiated upon the charms of a Paris life. \"I confess I enjoy it immensely,\" he said. \" At Paris one obtains all the pleasures of life upon such easy terms, while here it is a perpetual toil and struggle ; downright hard work ; a social tread-mill. I do not despair of converting Lady Tenby to my views on the subject sooner or later, and if I could persuade her to abjure London, I think"], [246, "ON THE BRINK. 238 I should take up my abode on the boulevards for the rest of my days.\" \" That is a proposal I shall most assuredly decline whenever it is made,\" was Lady Tenby's reply. \"I am much better where I am.\" And then she quietly resumed her conversation with Lord Windermere. Lord Tenby only remained a few weeks in London. He was very fond of yachting, and went clown to Cowes, where he had a splendid vessel waiting for him, of course one of the best that was to be had for money or credit. His intention was to pass the autumn in the Mediterranean, and he did his best, though in vain, to persuade Compton to accompany him. To the colonel's excessive annoyance, the noble lord appeared to have taken a great liking to him, and during his stay in town frequently lounged away an hour in his rooms. Compton could not very well say, \" Not at home,\" to a man in whose house he was almost a daily visitor ; and in fact, if he could have forgotten that the Earl of Tenbv"], [247, "ON THE BRINK. 239 was the Countess of Tenby's husband, he wrould have taken pleasure in the conversation of one who was so well-read in every branch of litera ture, who had seen much, and had contrived to amass by various means a vast amount of in formation on all sorts of subjects. Compton was surprised to find that by degrees he became quite reconciled to visits, which, at first, he had looked upon as an infliction. Once, and once only, Lord Tenby began dis cussing family matters, and lamenting the estrangement which existed between himself and his wife, which he charitably attributed to Mr. Halsted's interference and the violence of Lady Tenby's temper, but Compton stopped him before he had time to dilate upon these topics. \" You must excuse me, my lord, if I refuse to listen to you,\" he said. \" That differences should exist between Lady Tenby and her husband must be a subject of deep regret to all her friends ; but from what I knew of her as a girl, and from what I see of her now, I do not"], [248, "240 ON THE BRINK. believe that they can have arisen from any want of self-control on her part. With regard to her father, I have not known him long, it is true, but I have the highest opinion of his good sense and judgment, and I do not think him a man to thrust himself needlessly between husband and wife. It is certain therefore that I should not take the same view of the question that you do, and under these circumstances I am sure you will agree with me that any dis cussion of it would be worse than useless.\" \" Ah, I see,\" replied Lord Tenby, \" you have heard all sorts of stories about me, some very probably with a foundation of truth, and no doubt losing nothing in the telling. But you ought to recollect that the devil is not as black as he is painted. However, you were quite right to stop me, for after all no man has a right to bore another with his domestic grievances. You must permit me however to say that I wish Lady Tenby had had a friend like Colonel Compton to advise her in the first instance.\""], [249, "ON THE BRINK. 241 Goodwood races were at hand, and every body was preparing to leave town. Mr. Halsted had retained his practice of making a tour on the continent during the few weeks' vacation which he allowed himself, and more than once had been accompanied by his daughter, and this year it had been settled that they were to visit Ireland together. But when the time appointed for their departure drew near, Mr. Halsted announced that, owing to an unexpected pressure of business, it would be out of his power to leave London for more than a day- or two at a time. Lady Tenby, thus thrown upon her own resources, gladly ac cepted an invitation from the Windermeres to pass the autumn with them, and this led to a slight discussion between Lady Windermere and her husband. \" Of course,\" said the lady, \" w-e must ask her old friend, Colonel Compton, to meet her.\" But to this Lord Windermere demurred. \" My dear Cecilia,\" he said, \" there is no one I like and respect more than Compton. I am vol. i. R"], [250, "242 ON THE BRINK. convinced that he is a man of the strictest principle, one whom nothing would tempt knowingly to be guilty of a dishonourable action. But, believe me, he sees as much of Lady Tenby in London as is good for either of them. He may not be aware of it himself, but it is something more than friendship that he feels for her.\" \" I do not believe a word of it,\" said Lady Windermere, rather warmly. \" Men never will understand that friendship may exist between a woman and one of their own sex without their falling in love with each other. I suppose you will be accusing poor Eleanor next.\" \" No,\" Lord Windermere replied. \" Lady Tenby's manner to Compton is so open, so free from all restraint, she expresses her regard for him so frankly, that no one can suppose for a moment that there is anything left unspoken. It is not so with him. He is so guarded in all he says and does ; so evidently on the watch to repress all appearance of warmth, or even of"], [251, "ON THE BRINK. 243 interest, that, on my mind at least, it always leaves the impression that there is something behind which he dares not avow, something to lie concealed.\" \"Poor Colonel Compton!\" rejoined Lady Windermere. \" He may well say, ' Heaven guard me from my friends !' \" v Now, my dear Cecilia, that is not just. I believe I am acting the part of a real friend to Compton by not exposing him to unneces sary temptation ; and I think so well of him, that I am convinced he would be the first to acknowledge it, could I say to him what I have just said to you.\" \" Tell me, George,\" asked Lady Winder mere, anxiously, \"have you ever heard any ill-natured remarks made on their intimacy ?\" \" Not a syllable, on my honour. But you know of what quick growth scandal is wheu once the seed is sown, and the slightest whisper is sufficient for that.\" \"Poor Eleanor, poor dear Eleanor!\" said Lady Windermere. \" Would to God she had"], [252, "244 ON THE BRINK. married Colonel Compton instead of that heart less wretch !\" \" And to that I say Amen,\" replied her hus band. \"But that very exclamation of yours ought to prove to you that I am right. I do not believe that at this moment Lady Tenby feels for Compton one atom more than she professes. But will this state of things last for ever ? Brought into perpetual contact with a man like Compton, who seems to me to be endowed with every quality most calculated to inspire attachment, knowing how entirely devoted to her he is, very possibly divining the nature of his feelings, does it not occur to you that she too may, some time or other, say as you have just said, ' Would to God she had married Compton, instead of the husband to whom fate has condemned her?' Hard and painful as is her present lot, it would be ag gravated a hundredfold if she gave her heart without being able to give her hand ; if she yielded to a love hopeless in itself, and which her conscience would condemn. At least let"], [253, "ON THE BRINK 245 us keep clear of the possibility of being acces sory to such a catastrophe.\" \" Oh, if that wretch would but die !\" ex claimed Lady Windermere, in the fulness of her Christian charity. \" Yes, but that wretch, by whom I presume you mean Lord Tenby, has no thoughts of dying to please you, as far as I can see.\" \" But, George, we have lived on terms of such intimacy latterly with Colonel Compton, that I do not see how we are to avoid asking him, without positive rudeness, for a week or two at all events. It would be noticed, and perhaps would give rise to the comments which we are so anxious to avoid.\" \" Perhaps you are right, so we will com promise matters. We will ask him for the month of September. He will be shooting all day, and come home tired to death. If with that I can but prevail on him to drink a fair share of claret, there may be some hope of his sleeping away the evening. At all events, the house will be full of men, humble adorers of"], [254, "246 ON THE BRINK. Lady Tenby and yourself, so that tete-a-tetes will be out of the question, and he will be obliged to take his chance with the rest.\" \"Depend upon it,\" retorted Lady Winder mere, \" Colonel Compton is far too well-bred to sleep in the presence of ladies. I wish I could say as much for your lordship, for I think I have seen you nodding when you ought to have been making yourself agreeable to your guests.\" The invitation was given and declined. Compton had promised to join Sir Philip in a tour to the Rhine and various German water ing-places, and the time of their return was uncertain, probably not till October. \" Well,\" said Lord Windermere, much relieved by what he considered a proof of prudence on the part of the colonel, \"at all events, you must come to us as soon as you do get back.\" \" And if you can persuade your cousin to accompany you,\" added her ladyship, \"you will be doubly welcome.\""], [255, "ON THE BRINK. 247 CHAPTER XL Sir Philip and his cousin, on their return to England, went down to the Windermeres', and found a large party assembled. Lady Tenby was still there, but on the second day after their arrival she was recalled to London by the somewhat sudden death of Lady Miranda Halsted, after an illness of eight-and-forty hours, which no one thought of consequence. No doubt the disappointment to Compton was great; but whatever his feelings, they were confined to his own breast. Sir Philip was much more noisy in his demonstrations of vexation at the contretemps. He made no secret of his admiration for Lady Tenby, and really"], [256, "248 ON THE BRINK. felt for her that sort of platouic passion which the troubadours of old professed to feel for the ladye of their love, in all probability with more sincerity than his prototypes. Compton was alternately amused and annoyed by the extravagance of language in which his cousin indulged when expatiating upon Lady Tenby's charms of mind and person. This, however, did not render Sir Philip insensible to the merits of Lady Winifred Langley, who had accompanied her brother and sister-in-law on a visit to the Windermeres. On the contrary, after a long and careful scrutiny into the good qualities of the two objects of his admiration, he found, to his great surprise, that the balance slightly inclined in favour of Lady Winifred, to whom he accordingly proposed on the eve of the day fixed for his return to London, and by whom he was accepted. Compton did not return with him. The Windermeres pressed him to remain, and he complied, much to his credit, for he had re ceived a long letter from Lady Tenby, in"], [257, "ON THE BRINK. 249 which, amongst other things, she said that not only she, but her father, were looking forward with impatience to seeing him again. The temptation was great, but he resisted it, al though, as if to furnish him with every excuse, Lord Margate wrote to beg Colonel Compton to call on him as soon as he conveniently could after his arrival in town. He showed the letter to Lord Windermere, and Lord Winder mere advised his immediate departure. \" It may prove of consequence to you,\" he said. \" You stand well with Lord Margate, and great men like to see their wishes attended to with out delay. I am afraid it sounds inhospitable, but I say Go, by all means.\" \" Well, then, I will go on Monday, and will write to tell him so. But I must positively have one day with the hounds, as hunting be gins to-morrow, and you are good enough to give me a mount.\" He flattered himself that his secret was still his own ; he was determined to keep it so at any cost, and he succeeded. Lord Windermere"], [258, "ON THE BRINK. 250 began to waver in his opinion, and his wife was more than ever convinced that the idea of Compton 's love for Lady Tenby was a vain imagination. With very natural female curi osity, she had exhausted all her ingenuity in framing questions and instituting conversations with her guest, which she thought must neces sarily throw light upon the question. But it was all in vain. Compton was so circumspect in his answers, so unembarrassed in all his allusions to Lady Tenby, that her friend was completely baffled, without even a suspicion that her artful investigations had been met and defeated by an art superior to her own. On Compton 's arrival in London, his first visit was to Lord Margate, and he had the satisfaction of finding that his presence had been required for the purpose of answering two or three questions which he could have done just as well by letter. The minister, however, was very gracious, and as he was taking leave, asked him if, in reconstructing the Indian department, there should be any vacant place"], [259, "ON THE BRINK. 251 suitable for a man of his standing and abilities, he would feel inclined to give up his profession for the sake of it ; in short, to abandon the sword for the pen. \" I make no offer,\" he said, \" for I cannot at present say how the new India Board will be constituted. I only mention it now, that in case I have it in my power to make it hereafter, you may be pre pared with an answer.\" It was the very thing Compton could have wished. At present all his wishes tended to a permanent residence in England. He thanked Lord Margate for his kindness, and told him that he would take the subject into considera tion. He then turned his steps towards Eaton Square. Mr. Halsted's house he knew was shut up, that gentleman having quitted it after his wife's death, and taken up his abode in a furnished apartment in the Albany. Compton found Lady Tenby in deep mourning, and altogether more subdued than he had expected. After the first greetings he asked after her"], [260, "252 ON THE BRINK. father, and went on to say, \" I will not go through the mockery of offering you my con dolences on the death of your stepmother, for, considering her conduct to you when you were living in her house, and the distant terms on which you have been since, her death can not have been a source of much affliction to you. \" Well, Arthur,\" she replied, \" you are wrong. I will not say that it is a great af fliction to me, but the sudden death of one so closely connected with me, whom I had known so long and so well, made a most painful im pression on me. Above all, I regret that I had no opportunity of exchanging forgiveness with her, for no doubt I tried her severely at times, and my rejection of Mr. De Lacy must have been a great disappointment to her.\" \" I suppose it was,\" said Compton ; \" but it was one of her own making. She had no right to expect that you should sacrifice yourself to please her.\" Then, perceiving that he was getting upon rather dangerous ground, he"], [261, "ON THE BRINK. 253 turned the conversation to Mr. Halsted. \" How does your father bear it ?\" he asked. \" It is difficult to say. He has never men tioned her name since our first meeting, but he seems to feel it more than I could have supposed. It certainly must have made a great void in his existence, and produced a change in all his habits ; and he talks of selling his house. I wanted him to come and live with me, but he says he will never be an in mate of the same house with Lord Tenby. He is looking very ill, I think, and I cannot help fearing that there is something more than my mother-in-law's death preying upon him. 1 so much wish I could persuade him to take a holiday of a week or two, late as it is. You must see him, Arthur, and try what you can do. But I advise you to avoid all mention of Lady Miranda. He even stopped me, and begged me, not only never to allude to it my self, but to warn my friends that the subject was a very painful one to him. In fact, I heard that the last scene was a very distressing"], [262, "254 ON THE BRINK one. She would not believe she was dying, and at the last her mind wandered, and she kept calling upon some one she had known in her youth, to save her ; poor woman !\" \" Poor woman indeed ! relying on earthly help at such a moment. With regard to your father, I will do my best. I have no doubt he would be better for a change. And where do you think of taking him at this time of \"What I should like would be to go to Longwater. I have never been there since my childhood, and though it is so late in the year, I think we might manage it comfortably enough, if this fine weather lasts. But if we go, you must go too ; I will take no refusal.\" Without giving himself time for reflection Compton accepted, and moreover said that he would give Mr. Halsted no peace till he con sented. \"And, Auntie, how is she?\" he asked. \"Quite well, and flourishing; she will be delighted to see you. I drank tea with her yesterday, and I think you were the principal"], [263, "ON THE BRINK 255 subject of our conversation. My private opinion is that she is in love with you. But she is very tiresome ; you have no idea how difficult it is to get her out of the house. She says that in winter the proper place for a blind old woman is her own fireside, and I try in vain to persuade her that it is not winter yet, and that she is neither old, nor blind.\" \" Would it not be possible to tempt her to Longwater, if we go ?\" \" Oh, how I wish we could, but we might as well propose Lapland.\" When Compton left Lady Tenby, grave doubts assailed him as to the wisdom of his promise to make one of the party to Long water. It was too late to moralize, however. He had promised, and could not now retract, if he would, without laying himself open to a charge of churlishness and caprice. After all, why should he wish to back out of the engage ment ? Why should he not assist Lady Tenby in procuring that relaxation for her father, of which, by her account, he stood so much in"], [264, "256 ON THE BRINK. need? No doubt Longwater would evoke dangerous recollections, but he had no reason to mistrust his own steadiness of purpose, strengthened as it had been by the ordeal of the last six months. He could not always go on treating himself like a child. He called on Mr. Halsted, and, though in some measure prepared by Lady Tenby, he was really shocked by the alteration which a few weeks had wrought in his appearance. When Compton went abroad he had left the banker, though no longer young, without any signs of age, a stout, hearty-looking man of fifty, bearing his years well, active in mincl and body. He found him now shrunk to half his former size, with no trace of colour in his once florid cheeks, and his black hair grizzling fast. His voice was no longer loud and somewhat imperious, as in days of yore ; it had acquired a more gentle and kindly tone. Nor was he less changed in manner No one could ever have accused him of vulgarity; still, in his intercourse with the world there had been an"], [265, "ON THE BRINK 257 assumption of superiority, which might have been called dignity, or self-sufficiency, according to the good or ill will of the speaker. It was as if he had said, \" I am not only one of those who make laws for a sixth part of the human race, but by my wealth and influence, acquired by my own exertions, I can sway the destinies of foreign nations and their rulers ; I hold in my hand the success or failure of thousands, while for myself I can defy the strokes of fate.\" Now his demeanour was that of a man who, without any loss of self-respect, acknow ledges that there are times when the most independent may need the assistance or for bearance of their fellow men. To Compton his manner had always been most cordial. He liked the colonel, and he showed it. On the present occasion his greet ing was almost affectionate. \"Ah,\" he said, \"the sight of a friend does me good. I am indeed glad to see you, and hope you have no thoughts of running away again.\" \"That depends very much upon yourself, vol. I. s"], [266, "258 ON THE BRINK. for, if I do run away, it is to be in your com pany. I stand almost pledged to Lady Tenby to obtain your consent to take a fortnight's holiday, and I confess I have a strong personal interest in the matter, for if I succeed I am to have the honour of accompanying you.\" \" Quite out of the question, I am sorry to say, and so Burnthwaite will tell you,\" Mr. Halsted replied, with something like a sigh, and turning to his clerk, who had just entered the room. \" Burnthwaite will tell you nothing* of the sort, Colonel Compton,\" said the individual appealed to. \" On the contrary, it is the very best thing Mr. Halsted could do.\" Then, addressing his master, \" You know, sir, there is nothing that can require your presence for a fortnight or three weeks.\" \" You forget the report from Rixon.\" \" No, I do not, sir. It is impossible it can arrive before the end of the month. However, I should advise your not going out of England, so that if anything of consequence were to"], [267, "ON THE BRINK. 259 occur I could telegraph for you, and you could be in London with the loss of very few hours.\" \"The fact is, Compton,\" said the banker, \"on the recommendation of your friend Collins, we have sent out a gentleman to examine the state of affairs of the Great West of Asia, and it is most essential that I should not be out of the way when his report arrives.\" \" But if, as Mr. Burnthwaite asserts, it can not arrive before the end of the month \" \" I said the end of this month, to be quite sure,\" said Mr. Burnthwaite ; \" but my own conviction is that you must not expect any thing from Rixon before the middle of next. I hope, Colonel Compton, you will insist upon his complying with her ladyship's request. You have only to look at him to see how much he needs rest. I am sure you never saw a man so changed in so short a time. Ten years older than when you saw him last, if he is a day.\" \" Now, colonel,\" said Mr. Halsted, shrugging"], [268, "260 ON THE BRINK. his shoulders, \"if you like a good, substantial dish of flattery, you know where to come for it. And where does Eleanor wish to go to ?\" \" Certainly not out of England ; the season is too far advanced for that. You had better discuss it with her, for I suppose I may tell her that you will go.\" \" No, do not tell her that. I must think it over. But you may say that I will dine with her to-morrow, and give her a positive answer. You may even add that I hope to be able to manage it.\" \" We ought to lose no time, for the days are getting very short.\" \" If I go at all, I shall be ready to start the day after to-morrow. There will be no delay on my side.\" Mr. Halsted did manage it, and made no opposition to Lady Tenby's Longwater plan. Compton had warned her that she would not know the place again, so many changes, calling themselves improvements, had been effected since she was there. The first thing she"], [269, "ON THE BRINK. 261 missed was the village inn, with its gorgeous sign, displaying a goat in top-boots, and arrayed in military attire, painted by the most celebrated artist of the district, resplendent with scarlet and gold, which she had never been able to pass without a glance of admiration. Probably she would not have valued its artistic merits as highly now as in the days of her childhood ; but it was with a sigh of disappointment that she heard from the irreproachably costumed waiter of the spacious hotel to which they were driven on their arrival, that it had been pulled down to furnish additional accommodation for its magnificent rival. She could not forbear expressing her disapprobation of the change, but she met with little sympathy, from her father at all events. \" My dear Eleanor,\" he said, \" I am sorry to say I am quite old enough to appreciate the comforts of a good hotel ; and I confess I prefer our apartments here to what we should probably have had to put up with at your friend, the Goat in Boots.\""], [270, "262 ON THE BRINK. \"Oh, papa, what a matter-of-fact observa tion ! I am sure you agree with me,\" she said, taming to Compton. \" I am happy to say,\" replied the colonel, \" that for once I can agree with both of you. I regret that the picturesque old inn has been pulled down, and I rejoice that we are not driven to it for shelter. I knew a little more of it than you did, Lady Tenby, for I lived in it for a week before I found lodgings at the Bacons', and I have a very vivid recollection of its manifold discomforts.\" \" Men think so much of their comforts. And now, papa, if you want me really to enjoy our trip, you must call me Nelly, at least as long as we are here. I do not think I should know myself under any other name at Longwater.\" \"Well, then, Nelly be it. But, my child, you hardly know what it is you ask of me. It was the name I always gave your clear mother. Others called her Eleanor, but to me she was always Nelly.\" \" No, indeed I did not know it, or I should"], [271, "ON THE BRINK. 263 not have been so thoughtless as to have said what I did. I will be Eleanor still.\" \" No, Nelly, you shall replace her in name, as you nearly do in my affection. For though you may not think it \u2014 indeed you have no reason to do so \u2014 my Nelly's child is become very dear to me.\" Seeing the turn the conversation was taking, Compton thought it advisable to leave the two to themselves. He quitted the room, and when he returned to it an hour afterwards, he found Nelly seated beside her father on the sofa, her hand locked in his, and with evident traces of tears in her eyes. It was too late when they arrived at Long water to go out that evening, but on the following morning Lady Tenby hardly gave them time to finish their breakfast, before she summoned her companions to accompany her on a pilgrimage to her old haunts. Mr. Halsted excused himself on the plea of having brought down with him a batch of letters to answer, but said that he should be quite at her service"], [272, "264 ON THE BRINK. after luncheon. She sallied forth, therefore, attended by Compton alone. Their steps were directed in the first instance to the cottage in which little Nelly had so long resided with her aunt. It was a fine morning, with as bright a glow as an autumn sun could throw around them, and, as they sauntered along, Lady Tenby adverted to what had passed between her and her father on the preceding evening. \" I feel,\" she said, \" that I am only now beginning to know my father. I should never have given him credit for so much tenderness, not of manner only, but of real feeling, as he displayed. He had never so much as mentioned my mother's name before last night, and then he told me all about his courtship, his passionate love for her, and his agonies at her death. He even entreated my pardon for his neglect of me in my childhood, and the wreck he has made of my happiness since. I would have stopped him if I could, for after all, though unfortunate in one particular, I can scarcely call myself unhappy, I have so much to be"], [273, "ON THE BRINK. 265 thankful for, and now I have found a father. He seemed really overcome when I told him so. But was it not strange, that after so many years he should break through his reserve at last ?\" \" I suppose,\" Compton replied, \" that during Lady Miranda's lifetime he felt himself tongue-tied, and that now her death has set him free.\" \" Perhaps. No doubt he felt himself awk wardly situated between us, but I cannot help thinking there is another cause. He gave me the impression of one who sees misfortune hovering over him, and who seeks to draw closer to him those on whose sympathies he has a claim.\" \" Surely you do not doubt his sincerity ?' \" Not for a moment,\" she replied, hastily. \" For heaven's sake do not allow such an idea to enter your head. No one could have said what he did, and said it as he did, without feeling it. I am convinced, not only that I possess his affection, but that I have long"], [274, "266 ON THE BRINK done so. What puzzles me, is why he should so suddenly give expression to it now, for in what I said there was nothing to call it forth.\" By this time they had arrived at what had once been Nelly's abode, but it was no longer to be recognized. Instead of the rude cart way, marked only by its ruts, across the green to the back of the house, there was now a well-rolled carriage-drive up to the door ; the green was inclosed with iron railings ; the two or three venerable trees which had shaded the pond were cut down ; the pond itself, in which the ducks, which Nelly was allowed to call her own, were w*ont to disport themselves, was filled up, and the whole was converted into a trim flower-garden. The house itself was smartened up and white-washed, or rather yellow-washed, and, probably to prevent its injuring the walls, the jessamine, with w-hich in days of yore the front had been covered, was rooted up. But in compensation a double coach-house and four-stall stable had been built, while a conservatory, fourteen feet by"], [275, "ON THE BRINK 267 six, opening into what was now the dining room, but had once been a sort of store-room, completed its character of one of those cottages of gentility which the prince of darkness is supposed to contemplate with so much satis faction. \" Oh, Arthur,\" said Lady Tenby, \" did you ever see such havoc as they have made with our poor old cottage ? I have not the heart to go into it, though I see it is empty. Let us go and pay a visit to Mrs. Bacon.'' Mr. Bacon was dead, but his widow kept on the farm. Compton she had seen when he had come down some months before to make inquiries about the Thorpes. She recognized him at once, but it was with some little diffi culty that she was made to comprehend that in the tall, handsome, well-dressed lady before her, she saw Miss Nelly Thorpe. \" Well, I never !\" she exclaimed. \" How things do come about, surelie ! And so you are little Miss Nelly, begging your pardon, colonel, for calling your good lady out of her name. And"], [276, "268 ON THE BRINK. a well-favoured couple you are, hoping no offence for making so free.\" No doubt it was Compton's business to set her right, but he was too much annoyed to find the proper words in time. The task fell upon Lady Tenby. Blushing a little, and with the slightest possible tone of embarrassment in her voice, she said, \" But dear Mrs. Bacon, we are not a couple at all. My husband's name is Lord Tenby. Colonel Compton is nothing more to me now than he was twelve years ago, a good, kind friend.\" A prolonged oh ! was Mrs. Bacon's response to this piece of information, whether produced by confusion at the bad shot she had made, or because her sense of the proprieties was wounded, it is difficult to determine. Lady Tenby probably interpreted it in the latter sense, for she went on to say, \" I wanted so much to see Longwater and my old friends once more, that, as Lord Tenby was not able to accompany me, I persuaded my father to bring me, and Colonel Compton was good"], [277, "ON THE BRINK. 269 enough to come too \u2014 to take care of us. I must bring my father to see you, Mrs. Bacon ; he knows how good-natured you used to be to me, when I was a tiresome, mischievous little girl.\" This explanation was perfectly satisfactory, and Mrs. Bacon relaxed. They talked of old times, till Compton reminded Lady Tenby that it was near her father's luncheon hour. On their way to the hotel they discussed all the incidents of the morning, with the exception of Mrs. Bacon's untoward speech ; and strange to say, in giving a very detailed account of their adventures to Mr. Halsted, it appeared to have escaped the recollection of both. They passed a very happy ten days at Longwater, and Lady Tenby was enchanted by the discovery she made, or fancied she made, of the identical spot which Leo had selected as a place of refuge from his tor mentors, on which she had first made Comp ton's acquaintance. She even insisted upon dragging her father, over whom she was fast"], [278, "270 ON THE BRINK. acquiring unbounded authority, through the mud and all sorts of abominations, to see it too, and was half inclined to adopt his suggestion of buying the adjoining field, and erecting on it a monument to friendship. Before they returned to London Mr. Halsted expressed a wish to go to Breaford, where Nelly was born and her mother was buried. Compton, rightly judging that on such a mis sion his company could be dispensed with, announced his intention of taking his leave of them, and paying his cousin, Sir Philip, a short visit. Neither Lady Tenby nor her father opposed this purpose. The latter went so far as to express his satisfaction at it. \" I should not have liked to say to you, ' Leave us,' \" he said, \" but I confess I greatly prefer going to Breaford alone with Nelly, for reasons which I am sure you understand.\" \" And when is Sir Philip to be married ?\" asked Lady Tenby. \" Early in the spring, I believe, and that makes me anxious to profit by his few remain-"], [279, "ON THE BRINK 271 ing bachelor days, for perhaps his wife will not view me with the same eyes that he does.\" \" You do not know Winifred if you say that. Depend upon it, her husband's friends will be hers too, or it will be their own faults.\" The next day they separated for their respective destinations."], [280, "ON THE BRINK. 272 CHAPTER XII. Comptox passed a fortnight at Sir Philip's, and on his return to town found that Mr. Halsted and Lady Tenby had preceded him by some days. He soon fell into his old habits, but with increased caution. His visits to Eaton Square were less frequent, but his inter course with Lady Tenby did not suffer from it. At that time of year it was very rare for her to have any formal engagement, and her deep mourning would have prevented her accepting it ; but four or five days in the week her father insisted upon her dining with him in the Albany, and to these dinners Compton was always asked as a matter of course. Or"], [281, "ON THE BRINK. 273 else Lady Tenby passed her evening at Mrs. Thorpe's, and there he was an equally welcome guest. Few were the days in which he did not contrive to meet her, but he was obliged to acknowledge that this course of treatment had not been attended with the beneficial effect which he had expected from it. It was seldom that he ventured to interrogate his own feelings, but sometimes they would force them- selves upon his notice, and he perceived with something like dismay that his love for Nelly w*as, if anything, increased. It had assumed a more passionate character. The more hope- less his case appeared, the greater his irrita- tion. Day and night he lived in a dream, but it was a dream from which he had no wish to wake. There were moments when he felt indignant with Nelly for the very openness and confidence with which she treated him. He was inclined to accuse her of trifling with his feelings, for he argued that it was impos sible she should not have some perception of them. At such moments he almost made up T VOL. I."], [282, "274 ON THE BRINK. his mind to declare his passion to her, with the certainty of being banished from her presence for ever. He thought that even that would be less hard to bear than the state of perpetual restraint in which he was now living. He would then leave England for ever, but with the consciousness that if his love was unre turned, Nelly could not refuse a passing tribute of pity to sufferings of which she was the cause. These fits of impatience, or rather of in sanity, were never of long duration, and when they passed away they were succeeded by a sort of disgust and contempt of himself for having entertained such thoughts for a moment. He renewed the vow he had made to watch over Lady Tenby's happiness with the vigilant care of a brother. Never from him should she hear a word that could cause her pain; never through him should her fair fame run the risk of an unfavourable comment. It could not be said that Arthur Compton's existence was exactly an agreeable one. In"], [283, "ON THE BRINK. 275 Lady Tenby's presence he had no thought but for her, but at other times the utter idleness to which he seemed to be condemned weighed upon him most oppressively. Few of his ac quaintance were in town, his club was almost deserted, but even had it been otherwise, to a man of his activity of mind and body, who for many years of his life had scarcely known what it was to pass four and twenty hours in repose, a few desultory visits, with an occa sional rubber at whist, would hardly have seemed occupation enough. He called upon Lord Margate once or twice, but though the great man was gracious and friendly as ever, he made no further sign. Compton was dis appointed, for, being of a sanguine nature, he had reckoned rather more confidently on Lord Margate's offers of service than that noble lord's words justified him in doing. At length the oracle spoke. The minister requested Compton to call upon him, and on his arrival told him that Government were thinking of sending some one on a secret mission to"], [284, "ON THE BRINK. 276 Egypt, and he had no doubt that, if their intentions were carried out, Colonel Compton would be the agent selected. \" It is not in my department,\" he said, \" but when we were discussing the business yesterday, my col league, whom it more particularly concerns, asked me if I could recommend any gentleman of ability, for whose integrity I could answrer, with a competent knowledge of eastern languages. I named you at once, and he ex pressed himself perfectly satisfied. He even told me that I might make you the offer, though the whole thing is still in abeyance. I have no doubt myself that your services will be put in requisition, though not immediately. Do you authorize me to announce your ac ceptance ?\" Compton assured him without hesitation that nothing could be more agreeable to him than such a mission, and thanked him warmly for his good offices. \" I thought it would suit you,\" continued his lordship, \" especially as it does not involve the"], [285, "ON THE BRINK. 277 abandonment of your profession ; and I feel certain that, by obtaining this appointment for you, I shall be serving the public as well as yourself. You will however bear in mind that everything is still undecided, and I must impress upon you the necessity of keeping the whole business absolutely secret, even from your dearest friend. Any indiscretion on yom part would be construed as a proof of in capacity.\" \"And very justly, my lord,\" Compton replied. \"You may rely upon it, I will do my best to prove myself worthy of your re commendation.\" \"I have no doubt of that,\" said Lord Margate, and then he continued, more con fidentially, \"If you are employed in this matter, and execute it successfully, it will give to you a claim upon Government, and to me a fair plea for introducing you into this office. I dare say you thought that I had forgotten the offer I made you, perhaps that I was not serious in making it, but you have no idea of"], [286, "278 ON THE BRINK. the difficulties which the routine of service imposes upon me. If, without good and sub stantial reasons, I were to confer a place of trust and emolument on any one who had not gone through the regular gradations of the office, I should have the whole of my sub- ordinates up in arms against me, absurd as it may seem.\" W \" I dare say, my lord,\" observed Compton, \" the strict rule of seniority has its incon veniences, but I can quite enter into the feeling. I do not think I should much relish seeing the most meritorious clerk in the civil service placed in command of a brigade over my head.\" \" I don't suppose you would, but I cannot admit that the cases are quite parallel. How ever,\" continued Lord Margate, laughing, \" I am sure that I, for one, should be very sorry to serve in a brigade so commanded.\" Compton left the office in high spirits at the prospect of active employment thus opening upon him, and in such a confidential capacity."], [287, "ON THE BRINK. 279 His great regret was that he was precluded from announcing to his friends his good fortune, and making them participators in his satisfac tion. His attention however was soon called to another and more delicate subject. One evening, on his return home, he found a note from Mr. Halsted, requesting him to call at the Albany on the following morning. To make sure of finding the banker at home, he went at what he knew to be that gentleman's usual break fast hour, and to his great surprise, knowing Mr. Halsted's punctual habits, found that he had not yet made his appearance. It was not long, however, before he entered the room in dressing-gown and slippers, and apologized for having kept his visitor waiting. \" Of course you are come to breakfast with me,\" he said. Compton replied that his hopes tended that way. \" That accounts for your being so early. But, my dear friend, it is no longer with Halsted the banker that you are going to breakfast. I have made up my mind to retire"], [288, "ON THE BRINK. 280 from business, and I wished to see you, not to ask your advice \u2014 it is too late for that \u2014 but to tell you my reasons. I am old enough to be your father, but I think, notwithstanding the disparity of our ages, I may venture to call you my friend, while the terms on which we have lived give you a right to my confidence. I will say more ; I have such a high opinion of your sound judgment and right feeling, that I shall feel easier if the step I have taken has your approbation.\" Compton was too much astounded by this exordium to say more than that he was pre pared to listen with attention to anything that Mr. Halsted might wish to say to him, but that he had no doubt beforehand of the wisdom of his decision. He noticed with satisfaction that the banker's manner showed no sign of agitation. \"Well then, let us first have our breakfast quietly. I am always against talking of business, fasting. By the bye, Nelly complains she has seen nothing of you for an age.\""], [289, "ON THE BRINK. 281 \" I am very much flattered by her thinking it so long. Measured by time, I think the age would be reduced to two days. But the truth is, I have been much occupied. It was the Indian mail, and that is always a busy time with me.\" Breakfast came to an end, and then Mr. Halsted entered upon his explanation. \" I need not tell you,\" he said, \" that I embarked very largely in the Great West of Asia, nor is it necessary to give you the reasons which induced me to think it a safe and profitable investment. I was deceived, as many hundreds were, amongst whom I may reckon my friend Colonel Compton. Rixon returned a few days ago, and his report deprives us of all hope. The thing is a total failure, and the money invested in it irrecoverably lost. More than that, I heard from him that one of the great Calcutta houses, whose bills I hold to a very large amount, was supposed to be on the eve of bankruptcy, and this has been confirmed since. I felt that it was time to look about"], [290, "282 ON THE BRINK. me, and the result is that I have come to a resolution to retire while I can yet do so with honour and with an untarnished name. Burnthwaite wishes me to persevere, and certainly brings forward good reasons in support of his opinion. He thinks that by making a stand I may yet recover my position. Perhaps if I were younger I might attempt it, but I have had enough of it. I feel weary, and long for repose. Besides, private banking is not what it was. The joint-stock banks are fast driving us out of the field, and my con- viction is, that long before the end of the century a private bank will be a thing of the past. I have made an arrangement with one of them to amalgamate my business with theirs. I shall invest the money that yet remains to me in their shares, and I am to have a seat at the board as one of the directors. All my employes are to be retained, and they insist upon my keeping my seat in parliament. I suppose they think it will add a sort of lustre to the establishment, and I am not sorry for it"], [291, "ON THE BRINK. 283 for I should be a miserable man without an occupation. As far as I am concerned, there fore, I shall not do badly. What is your opinion ?\" \" I think, sir, you have shown your usual sagacity and prudence. No doubt the loss of so much money is a great misfortune, but I think you quite right in declining to enter upon a struggle which would probably last many years, and might prove unsuccessful in the end. And for what object ? From what you say, I presume you will have as much as you require for yourself, and your daughter is well provided for.\" \"Ah,\" said Mr. Halsted, \"but now comes the worst part of my story. I have reserved twenty thousand pounds for myself, which, invested in bank shares, will, with my direction, give me between two and three thousand a year. The remainder of what I can save out of the wreck I shall make over to trustees, to pay the allowance I make my daughter and her husband, but it will produce little above five"], [292, "284 ON THE BRINK. thousand a year. I have hitherto allowed them ten ; they must be content with half.\" \" I do not think you have much discontent to fear from Lady Tenby,\" said Compton. \" As much as to say that I have from her husband. And yet he has no right to complain. In a very few years his estates would have been restored to him free from all incumbrance, had he not thought proper to lay on them a fresh accumulation of debt ; and he has received from me since his marriage five thousand a year, although his scandalous conduct to his wife would have justified me in refusing to assist him with a shilling.\" \" It is the price you pay for your daughter's tranquillity.\" \" It is so, though it never struck me in that light before. As you say, I have not much to apprehend from Nelly's murmurs. I had a long conversation with her yesterday, and ex plained matters to her fully. I told her that of course their reduced allowance would still be divided equally, as heretofore, between her and"], [293, "ON THE BRINK. 285 Lord Tenby, but that being so much diminished, it would be necessary for her to make great reductions in her establishment ; and what do you think was her answer ? That she would not touch a farthing of it, but that the whole should be paid over to her husband.\" \" But, good heavens, what will she have to live on?\" \" Before I answer that question, I will tell you what was settled between us after a long debate ; settled at least as far as it could be, for though her mind is pretty well made up, she wants to talk it all over with you, and hear your opinion before coming to a final decision. As I said, she wishes the whole five thousand to be paid to Lord Tenby during his life, but to this she attaches a condition ; it is that he shall consent to a legal separation.\" \" A separation !\" exclaimed Compton. \" I understood from Mrs. Thorpe that she would never hear of such a thing.\" \"Mrs. Thorpe told you the truth. It was urged upon her more than once by myself and"], [294, "286 ON THE BRINK. others, and she always refused. I was therefore as much astonished as you can be when she mentioned it, for the proposal came from her. But the reasons she gave were sound. She urged that she had now made for herself the position in the world which she had determined to obtain ; that no one now could suppose for a moment that her separation from Lord Tenby was occasioned by any fault of hers ; that she had run the round of society, and was thoroughly tired of its monotony ; that for some time past she had wished gradually to withdraw from it, and that the present circum stances afforded the very occasion she was seek ing ; but that as long as Lord Tenby had the power, even indirectly, of interfering with her, or controlling her actions, she could never for a moment feel herself her own mistress. But what I firmly believe to be her real, or rather her principal reason, was yet to come. ' And then papa,' she said, ' we will live together. I will keep house for you, and you will let Auntie live with us too.' I dare say,"], [295, "ON THE BRINK. 287 Compton, you will think me an old fool, but I really feel for that child an affection that I thought had been buried in the grave of her poor brother. I think I love her more since the day she insisted on my calling her Nelly.\" Compton was very far from thinking him an old fool for this declaration. His only w-onder was that he had been so long in finding out Nelly's worth. \" Now with regard to your question of what she will have to live on ; in the first place, whatever I have is hers, as a matter of course. Then the house in Eaton Square will be let, or sold, whichever her trustees may think the most for her benefit. She has six hundred a year of her own, and altogether we shall make up about four thousand a year. Enough to live on comfortably, in short.\" \" I know I lived in comfort for many years on a tenth part of that income,\" said Compton. \"It is true I had not a daughter to provide for.\" \"And at Lord Tenby's death,\" continued"], [296, "288 ON THE BRINK. Halsted, \"she will have a jointure of six thousand a year. Between ourselves, I do not think his lordship likely to be a long-lived man, considering the life he leads and the excesses to which he abandons himself; and then his allowance naturally reverts to his wife. After all, my Nelly may yet be an heiress in a small way.\" \" In a small way !\" exclaimed Compton. \" Really, Mr. Halsted, your magnificent ideas take away one's breath.\" \" Well, in a large way then. It is absurd, I know ; but my dear Compton, I cannot yet forget that this time last year I could write myself good for more than a million.\" \" It is a change, a great change, and I con fess I am astonished to see how little it seems to affect you.\" \" You wrould not say so, if you knew what my last few months have been. One perpetual state of anxiety and terror for what the coming day might bring. Now, thank God, I know the worst, which might have been worse still, and,"], [297, "ON THE BRINK. 289 having made up my mind how to meet it, my mind is at ease, and I feel an indescribable sensation of relief.\" \" I can quite understand that,\" said Compton. \" But to return to Lord Tenby. Is it quite certain that he will accept the terms you propose ?\" \"I entertain no doubt of it. When once Nelly undertakes anything it is with the deter mination to go through with it ; and should Lord Tenby refuse an amicable arrangement, she will have recourse to a court of law. He will hardly risk that, with such proofs of his flagrant misconduct as we possess. He must be aw-are that he has not a leg to stand upon ; and moreover, the upshot of it would be that he would lose his five thousand a year.\" \" And you think she will never repent the step she is now taking ?\" \" Never,\" said Mr. Halsted, decidedly. \" If at this moment Lord Tenby w*ere to implore her forgiveness, she would give it him, but it would make no difference in her feelings or VOL.

He made his dragoman purchase a Circassian slave, and then married her himself according to the Mahommedan rite. A month afterwards he divorced her before the Cadi, and left uex,plantee la, with a few hundred pounds and some jewels he had given her. Rixon said all Egypt was ringing with it.\" \" And can nothing be done to bring him to an account ?\" \" How is one to obtain the necessary evidence, aud if obtained, a quoi bon ? Nelly would still be his wife. I declare to God, Compton,\" con tinued Mr. Halsted, getting up and walking about with great agitation, \" I have sometimes doubted, seeing the share I had in this most unhappy marriage, whether it was not my duty to free her from the yoke, by shooting the scoundrel the first time I met him, as I would a mad dog.\" \" Good heavens ! Mr. Halsted, you are not serious.\""], [299, "ON THE BRINK. 291 \" Quite serious in saying that I have had such temptations. But that time is passed. Nelly loves me now, and I am quite content to leave the rest in the hands of Providence. But I must not forget to tell you that she expects you in Eaton Square as soon as you leave me. You are on no account to fail her.\" It appears that Lady Tenby did not rely implicitly on Compton's obedience to her mandate. While her father was yet speaking the door opened, and she walked into the room. \" I was half afraid you would be gone,\" she said, addressing the colonel, \"but I left orders at home to detain you in case you arrived while I was out. Has papa told you all ?\" \"Everything, Nelly, from beginning to end,\" said Mr. Halsted, as he left the room. \" Now, Arthur,\" said Lady Tenby, \" tell me truly what you think of my determination. You are an impartial judge, and I have that confidence in you, that I should distrust my own judgment if it were not confirmed by your approbation.\""], [300, "292 ON THE BRINK. An impartial judge! To that title at all events Compton knew he had no right. It was with a thrill of satisfaction that he had heard of the contemplated separation between Lord and Lady Tenby, but it sprung from motives which he hardly dared avow to himself, still less to others. But, whatever his faults in other respects, he was honest to the back bone. He distrusted himself, and endeavoured to evade the responsibility- thus imposed upon him. \"Dear Lady Tenby,\" he said, but his heart reproached him as he said it, \" I have an almost superstitious dread of interfering by word or deed between a husband and his wife.\" \" Surely not, Arthur, when it is a sister who implores your advice, who almost places her destiny in your hands ! Or am I no longer to call you brother? You said once,\" she con tinued, taking his hand, \" that I might rely on you in my hour of need. Well, that hour is come.\" Could he still withhold his aid, as she sat by"], [301, "ON THE BRINK. 293 his side, questioning him with those mournful, pleading eyes, as if on the next words he uttered her fate depended ? One shot he had fired for the honour of the flag, and now he surrendered at discretion. \"Yes, yes,\" he said, \"your brother still. A brother on whose devoted and un changing friendship you may rely in all con fidence. My hesitation did not arise from any selfish motive, or from fear of the responsibility you would have me assume. And yet it is a heavy responsibility. For should you here after repent any decision you may now come to, you will have a right to cast the burthen of it on those who advised you to it. Have you reflected well on the step you propose taking, and all its consequences, probable and pos sible ? Remember, once completed, there is no return. Are you very, very- sure you know your own wishes ?\" \" On that point,\" Lady- Tenby replied, \" you may set your mind quite at rest. It is no hasty resolution I am taking. I have long foreseen it must come to this at last, and have"], [302, "ON THE BRINK. 294 considered the question in all its bearings. Indeed, Cecilia, Lady Windermere I mean, could tell you that we discussed it last year. It is true, things might have gone on a little longer, had it not been for this change in my father's circumstances. As it is, I think the proper time has arrived for informing Lord Tenby of my intentions \" \"From what fell from Mr. Halsted,\" said Compton, \"I gathered that he approved of your decision.\" \" Entirely ; in fact, he wished me to take it long ago.\" \" Well, if that is so, and if you really think it will conduce to your w-ell-being,\" said Compton, but the words fell from his lips slowly, and with something like an effort, \" I join my voice to his.

Compton's approbation removed all Lady Tenby's scruples, if ever she had had any, and Mr. Halsted proceeded at once to carry out her determination. He instructed Mr. Cox, his solicitor, to communicate to Lord Tenby, who had again taken up his abode at Paris, his wife's fixed resolve never to live under the same roof with him again. The ground taken for making this move was his late Egyptian scandal. He was told that Lady Tenby had already overlooked offences to w*hich few women would have submitted in silence, but that this last outrage, no less than an act of bigamy, was of too serious a character to be"], [305, "297 ON THE BRINK. pardoned. That Lady Tenby owed it to herself, no less than to society, whose laws he had violated, to mark her sense of it by insist ing upon an immediate legal separation. Out of regard for his family, she had no wish to bring her wrongs before the public in a court of justice, if it could be avoided, but in case of his refusal to settle the question amicably, she was quite prepared to do so. The learned gentleman then touched upon the pecuniary arrangements proposed. Nelly had insisted upon no mention being made of the sacrifice of her own interests, and her father acquiesced the more readily, as he had no wish to enter upon an explanation of his losses to his son-in-law. Lord Tenby was simply informed that, as Mr. Halsted was on the point of retiring from business, it was his wish to regulate all his pecuniary engagements, and amongst others, the allowance he was in the habit of making his daughter and her husband. To this his lord ship must be aware that he had forfeited all claim, and as it was not legally secured to him,"], [306, "298 ON THE BRINK. it depended solely and entirely upon Mr. Hal sted's pleasure whether he should continue to receive it. That gentleman however was willing to continue the payment of it, and even to secure it to Lord Tenby for his life, on condition of his acquiescence in the separa tion now proposed. Should he refuse, and it was found necessary to have recourse to legal measures, it would be withdrawn altogether. This communication took Lord Tenby com pletely by surprise. He had continued his profligate career so long unchecked, that he seemed to look upon any interference with it as an audacious violation of his undoubted prero gative. His answer, which was addressed to his wife, was written in a tone of injured innocence. He began by expressing his profouud astonishment at a communication which he had just received from Mr. Halsted's solicitor. He did not condescend to justify himself from the accusations brought against him. He took not the slightest notice of his alleged patriarchal practices in Egypt. But"], [307, "ON THE BRINK. 299 he said that, when he recollected the friendly terms on which they had parted a few months before, he could not bring himself to believe that Cox's letter had been written by her authority, or even with her cognizance. He said that, supposing she had any fair grounds of complaint against him, and he was willing to admit that such might exist, he was certain she would never have had recourse to such extreme measures without having first afforded him an opportunity of justifying himself from accusations now brought against him for the first time. \"I know you too well,\" he went on to say, \" to suppose for a moment that you would be a party to so extraordinary a proposal as that of our separation, except under the influence of others. I do not pretend to be perfect. Who is ? But I am quite certain that, if you have allowed such a letter as I have just received to be written on your behalf, my faults must have been grossly exaggerated before you could bring yourself to"], [308, "300 ON THE BRINK. such a step. I am quite aware of Mr. Halsted's dislike, and I am convinced that I do him no injustice when I attribute the whole of these harsh, these unprecedented proceedings, to him alone. Indeed, the fact that the letter was written by Cox, his solicitor, is sufficient proof of that. But in such a case, when it is a question of setting aside the most sacred ties, of breaking the most solemn vows, I must entreat you to judge for yourself. Do not let me be the victim of misrepresentation. I shall be in London in ten days or a fortnight, and have such confidence in your sense of justice, that I look foward without misgiving to receive from you the same welcome as ever. \" Yours affectionately, \" Tenby.\" What could have been Lord Tenby's motive for inditing such an epistle, or for so anxiously deprecating the severance of ties which he had seemed completely to ignore, it is impossible to say. Perhaps he thought that, by holding out, he could drive a better bargain with Mr. *t"], [309, "ON THE BRINK. 301 Halsted ; perhaps he foresaw that the slight amount of consideration with which he was still treated by his equals would vanish entirely, when the mantle which Lady Tenby's for bearance had hitherto thrown over his vices should be withdrawn ; perhaps he felt a returning inclination for the wife whom he was on the point of losing for ever ; or it might have originated in the pure spirit of contra diction. Be that as it may, the letter concocted with so much care, and of which he was justly proud, did not produce the desired effect; although a young lady to whom he read it, or rather translated it, and on whose judgment he had great reliance, assured him that it was irresistible, and must elicit a favourable answer from any woman with a spark of generosity in her composition. \" Va, mon ami. 11 faut que Miledi ait un c\u0153ur de pierre, si elle persiste dans son entetemfnt.\" Although Nelly's heart was formed of softer materials than Mademoiselle Aldegonde gave it credit for, she did persist. By return of"], [310, "ON THE BRINK. 302 post, Lord Tenby received the following answer. \" My Lord, \"In reply to your lordship's letter, I beg to state that the communication you received from Mr. Cox was made, not only with my cognizance and approbation, but by my desire. As it is my firm intention to abide by the resolution therein expressed, I beg to decline all further correspondence with your lordship, and request you to make known to Mr. Cox, with as little delay as may be, your acceptance or rejection of the terms proposed to you by that gentleman. \"I have the honour to be, \" Your lordship's obedient servant, \" Eleanor Tenby.\" \" By Jove, she is in earnest, and no mistake,\" was Lord Tenby's observation to himself, as he sat down to consider what was best to be done. The result of his cogitations was that he addressed a letter to Mr. Halsted, expressive of his conviction that that gentleman could"], [311, "ON THE BRINK. 303 never, upon reflection, sanction so monstrous a project as that of a separation between himself and Lady Tenby \u2014 a project which would inevitably be fraught with the most injurious consequences to her. He recapitulated all the advantages of rank and position, actual and prospective, which Miss Halsted had acquired by her marriage, and which she must to a great extent renounce if she persisted in her present design. \" A wife separated from her husband,\" he said, \" always finds herself in an invidious position, even when supported by powerful family connections, which will be totally wanting in Lady Tenby's case, as she has none of her own, and the sympathies of my relations will naturally be enlisted on the side of the husband she deserts. She will find too late that she has forfeited the place in society which she now occupies, and will sink into insignificance, which to a person of her tastes and love of dissipation will be peculiarly irksome.

Should she therefore be so ill-advised as to drag me before a public tribunal, I shall have it in my power to allege much in justification of my conduct. I must beg of you to represent all this to your daughter, and to urge her to abandon a course of proceeding which cannot fail to do us both great and irreparable injury.\" From Mr. Halsted the noble lord met with less attention than from Lady Tenby. That gentleman did not think it necessary to answer the letter addressed to him, himself, but again had recourse to Mr. Cox, who announced to Lord Tenby that Mr. Halsted had desired him to inform his lordship, in reply to his last communication, that, as Lady Tenby's decision met with her father's hearty approbation, he certainly should take no steps to induce her to rescind it, and declined altogether to discuss the topics introduced by Lord Tenby. Then Mr. Cox addressed him in his own proper person, and begged to draw his lordship's attention to"], [313, "ON THE BRINK. 305 the proposals contained in his first letter, adding, that a speedy decision was desirable, inasmuch as Hilary Term was approaching, and it would be difficult to stay legal proceedings once begun. Thereupon Lord Tenby addressed himself seriously to the question of indemnification for what he was pleased to term the loss of domestic happiness, and this opened up a wide field for discussion, to which it is very possible the late correspondence had been iutended to pave the way. He entered upon a most masterly analysis of the terms proposed, asserting, and with great acuteness endeavour ing to prove, that they were totally insufficient. He urged that the original allowance promised by Mr. Halsted was ten thousand a year, and that when, notwithstanding his remonstrances, half of it had been allotted to Lady Tenby, it was upon the distinct understanding that this was to be applied to the maintenance of their joint establishment, in which he might, had he so pleased, have participated from the first of vol.

Now, if the separation were actually to take place, he would find himself deprived of all share in the house he had so long con sidered his own, and all the advantages there unto appertaining. In short, he would be absolutely obliged to provide for his own maintenance and that of his servants out of his own resources, to say nothing of the discomforts of a hotel or lodgings. Under these circum stances, he submitted that, in common fairness, half of the sum now allotted to Lady Tenby ought to be paid to him, in addition to what he already received. There could be the less objection to this, as, of course, Lady Tenby would see the propriety, after abjuring the protection of her husband, of giving up the world, and retiring into comparative seclusion. As, however, he had no wish to throw any unnecessary difficulties in the way of a separa tion, which he was now reluctantly compelled to believe was Lady Tenby's own wish, he was willing to accept, instead of the proposed"], [315, "ON THE BRINK. 307 addition to his income, a sum of money down \u2014 say twenty thousand pounds \u2014 to enable him to purchase and furnish a house of his own. He left the choice of the alternatives to Mr. Halsted, but on one or the other of them he must, in justice to himself, insist. This letter was not attended with any more favourable results than its predecessors. Mr. Cox wrote to inform him that Mr. Halsted had no intention of departing from the terms he had originally offered, and as Lord Tenby de clined acceding to them, he requested to be favoured with the name of his lordship's solicitor. Lord Tenby could no longer doubt that the crisis was approaching, and bestirred himself accordingly. He came to London, leaving his privy-councillor in floods of tears at his refusal to allow her to accompany him. She had so long wished to make acquaintance with the land of fogs and guineas that she felt the dis appointment acutely. However, there was no help for it, and she was obliged to console her-"], [316, "ON THE BRINK. 308 self with her Theseus's promise to return\u2014 more fortunate in that than the daughter of Minos. On his arrival, Lord Tenby drove straight to Eaton Square, with a view of taking the garrison by surprise and storming the citadel. He thought that, once in possession, with the governor in his power, it would be easier for him to dictate the terms of her deliverance. Unfortunately for his calculations, the possi bility- of this move had been foreseen. When, therefore, the door was opened at his summons, he was confronted by a porter w-hose face was unknown to him, standing six feet six in his stockings, stout in proportion, and attired in a livery which was not Lord Tenby's. To that noble lord's interrogatories, he replied that Lady Tenby no longer lived there. He be lieved she was in the country, but was not quite sure. The house was let till Easter to Sir Curry Rice, and her ladyship had left in structions to have all her letters forwarded to Mr. Halsted's, Z, 21, Albany. As there was nothing more to be obtained"], [317, "ON THE BRINK. 309 by a protracted examination of him whom Lord Tenby irreverently termed Cerberus in plush, his next proceeding was to secure an apartment at a hotel, and then, late as it was, he started for the Albany, with the firm deter mination of having it out with old Halsted. But here he met with no better success than in Eaton Square. His ring at the bell was answered by an elderly housekeeper-looking female, who gave him nearly the same answer that he had received from Sir Curry Rice's porter. Mr. Halsted was out of town, where, she could not justly say, but all letters were sent to Mr. Cox. As his lordship was very pressing in his questioning, and seemed intent on effecting an entrance, the old lady, who perhaps took him for one of the swell mob, and at all events did not like his general ap pearance, for the weather was cold, and he was well wrapped up in great coat and comforter, shut the door very unceremoniously in his face. In great dudgeon he retired, to take what ease he could in his inn."], [318, "ON THE BRINK. 310 The next morning, at an hour unusually early for him, he betook himself to Mr. Cox's office in the Outer Temple, and this time, at all events, he was fortunate enough to find the object of his search at home. On sending in his card, after the delay of a few minutes he was admitted to Mr. Cox's presence, who courteously inquired to what he owed the honour of his lordship's visit. \" I wish you to give me Lady Tenby's ad dress,\" was the reply. \" I regret, my lord, to say that it is out of my power to comply with your lordship's request.\" \" How so, Mr. Cox ? I am told that all letters addressed to the Albany are forwarded to you.\" \" It would have been more correct, my lord, to say that I am not at liberty to comply with your lordship's request.\" \"Not>t liberty! Refuse a husband the address of his wife ! I do not understand this sort of thing at all, and cannot allow it to rest here.\""], [319, "ON THE BRINK. 311 \" I can only obey my instructions, my lord. Both Lady Tenby and Mr. Halsted have de sired me to refuse you their address, as they positively- decline receiving any communication from your lordship, except through me.\" \" I tell you what it is, Mr. Cox,\" said Lord Tenby, losing his temper, \" it is clear to me that you are all in a conspiracy together to force Lady Tenby to a separation. I suppose you expect to make a pretty good thing of this business ?\" \" I certainly do,\" Mr. Cox replied. \" I think your lordship will have to pay me rather a heavy bill of costs.\" He then applied his mouth to a gutta-percha tube, down which he whispered some cabalistic words, which had the effect of bringing in one of his clerks, with a strip of paper in his hand. \" As you are here, my lord,\" Cox continued, \" permit me to have the honour of serving you personally with this writ.

It is our first step. As to what your lordship should do with it, the only suggestion I can make is, that you should take it to your solicitor and consult him. Being concerned for the plaintiff, it would be highly indecorous and unprofes sional were I to advise the defendant.\" Lord Tenby left the office without the cere mony of leave-taking, and, it is much to be feared, with no good-will towards its occupants in his heart. But he did not yet acknowledge that he was beaten. He knew that his mother felt a strong affection for his wife, and that it was warmly returned. He determined to see if he could not turn it to good account, and jumping into a cab, drove straight to old Lady Tenby's. Notwithstanding all his transgressions and"], [321, "ON THE BRINK 313 perversity, he was still the idol of his mother's heart. She had other children, and she loved them well, but, with true maternal sophistry, she argued that the scrapegrace, the mauvais sujet, was the one who stood most in need of her affection, the one who would have a right to claim her sympathy when that of the rest of the world was withdrawn from him. She no longer tried to excuse him, it is true, but she still clung to the hope that all she heard of his misdeeds was not true ; she still en deavoured to persuade herself that, sooner or later, he would repent and reform. Long she had trusted that the beauty, the good sense, the irreproachable conduct of his wife, would at length exercise their legitimate influence over him, and wean him from his evil courses, and it was a severe blow to her when she found that this last hope must be resigned. For Nelly had felt it her duty to announce her intentions, as soon as they were formed, to one who had ever treated her with the affection of a mother. When Lord Tenby entered the room in"], [322, "314 ON THE BRINK. which his mother was sitting, he was greeted with a flood of tears, a sight that produced in him a fit of impatience, which he had some difficulty in mastering. \"Surely, my dear mother,\" he said, \" if I were on the point of departure, those tears would be more appro priate than as a w-elcome to my arrival.\" \" Oh, Henry !\" was her reply, \" how can I do otherwise than shed tears at your arrival, wmen it is only to usher in your disgrace ?\" \" For heaven's sake, my dear mother, do not inflict upon me such melodramatic lan guage. I have always found you my best friend, and I come to you now to help me out of a scrape which is none of my own making, but which has been forced upon me. Lady Tenby, whatever her feelings may be for me, certainly entertains a great regard for you. I want you to talk to her, and persuade her to give up this absurd plan of a separation, which will be to the full as injurious to her as it can possibly be to me. I am sure a word from you would be sufficient.\""], [323, "ON THE BRINK. ' 315 \" You do not suppose, Henry, that I have waited for your suggestion to do my utmost to avert this misfortune. As soon as she wrote to inform me of her determination, which she did in language and with terms of affection for myself for which I shall ever feel grateful, I went to her at once, and entreated her to re consider her decision. And then it was she told me all, without a word of reproach against you, but merely stating facts which, in her own judgment and that of her friends whom she had consulted on the subject, made it impos sible for her ever to live with you again. I implored her to give you another trial. I would have gone down on my knees to her had she not prevented me ; but it was all in vain. I told her that I had long looked upon her as a child of my own, that I loved her as a daugh ter, and I asked her to grant my prayer for my sake alone. And then came the most painful trial of all.

Henry, I had not a wrord to say.\" \" In short,\" said Lord Tenby, bitterly, \" she has enlisted my mother in her cause. May I ask if it is your intention to give her your countenance, if she succeeds in obtaining a separation?\" \" I hardly know what you understand by countenance. I suppose our intercourse will be much abridged, perhaps broken off alto gether. Should it be so, it would grieve me deeply, but it will be for Eleanor to decide.\" \" Of course. Perhaps too you will leave it to her to decide whether I am to be received in this house.\" \" Henry, Henry, have I deserved this from you? \"No, no, indeed. Forgive me, and make some allowance for my vexation and irritation. I will not ask you for assistance, but have you no advice to give me ?\""], [325, "ON THE BRINK. 317 \" The only advice I can give you is to sub mit to what I am convinced is now irreparable. Eleanor's mind is quite made up, but she assured me that she had not the slightest wish to take legal proceedings unless forced to it, and that rests with you.\" \" But proceedings are already begun,\" ex claimed Lord Tenby. \"That infernal attorney of hers, Cox, has just shoved a writ into my hand.\" \" Then believe me, Henry,\" said his mother, in great trepidation, \" you have no time to lose, if you wish to avoid a public exposure. See Sir William Claremont. He arrived last week, and there is no one better qualified to give you advice.\" \" By Jove ! the very man. I did not know he was in England. Give me his address, and I will hunt him up at once.\" Lord Tenby showed rather more warmth of feeling when they parted than he had clone on their first meeting.

Moreover, the ad vice she had given him, to consult his brother in-law, was good, and he determined to profit by it without loss of time. He recollected that Sir William was an intimate friend of Colonel Compton, and he hoped that between them they might be able to persuade the colonel to exert his influence with Mr. Halsted and his daughter, and prevent the further prosecution of their designs. For to this hope he still clung, not withstanding the ill-success which had hitherto attended his efforts, and the discouragement he had met with on all sides. He was singularly pertinacious in adhering to any plan he had once formed, and any obstacles thrown in his way only served to irritate his desire of success."], [327, "ON THE BRINK. 319 Lord Tenby had no difficulty in finding his brother-in-law, who was willing enough to give him all the assistance in his power. Sir William had passed the last ten years of his life in India, and he was not very well up in Lon don gossip and scandal. He had heard from Lady Tenby (the dowager) of the proposed separation between her son and his wife, but while expressing her deep regret at it, she had avoided entering into particulars. On his side, Lord Tenby did not think it necessary to dwell upon his own delinquencies. He only told Sir William that his wife had been induced to listen to gross misstatements and exaggerations of his conduct ; and that her father, who had always disliked him, had availed himself of them to exact from her a promise never to live with him again. He confessed with the most praiseworthy candour that he had certainly neglected her a good deal, frequently absenting himself for months together, but she had never uttered a word of complaint or reproach, and therefore he had naturally concluded that his"], [328, "ON THE BRINK. 320 coming or going was a matter of indifference to her. Now, however, his wanderings were over, he was sincerely desirous of a reconciliation, and fully determined to give no fresh cause of offence. His great difficulty was how to enter into communication with her, as he could not obtain her address, and it was possible she would not open his letters. In this dilemma he had bethought him of Colonel Compton, who was an old friend of Lady- Tenby, and on an intimate footing w-ith her father. Would Sir William accompany him to the colonel's ? Sir William consented at once. What he had seen of Lord Tenby before he went to India he had liked, and he knew that nothing would be more pleasing to his mother-in-law, to whom he was much attached, than the restoration of a good understanding between her son and his wife. From Lord Tenby's statement, he thought nothiug could be easier than to effect this. To his apprehension, this estrangement, which threatened such serious consequences, had been caused by apparent"], [329, "ON THE BRINK. 321 coldness and neglect on the part of the gentle man, and pique on that of the lady, aggravated by the injudicious interference of friends. Lord Tenby professed repentance, and was no doubt sincere in his promises of amendment ; all that was required to set matters straight between the two was for them to come to a frank explanation on the subject of their mutual grievances. If this could only be effected by the intervention of a third party, he knew no one fitter to be intrusted with the negotiation than Compton, and so he told Lord Tenby. \" I shall be delighted,\" he said, \" if my reap pearance on English ground is signalized by the restoration of peace between you and Lady Tenby, of whom personally I know nothing, but of whom I have heard much, and all in her favour.
