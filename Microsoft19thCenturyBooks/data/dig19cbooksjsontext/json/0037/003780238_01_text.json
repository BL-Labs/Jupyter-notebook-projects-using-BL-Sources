IN the survey of Domesday the name of this Parish is written Herefelle ; in other ancient records Harvil, Harfeld, Herefelde. The parish of Harefield lies in the Hundred of Elthorne, and forms the north-west angle of the County of Middlesex, being bound ed on the north by Kickmansworth, in Hertfordshire ; on the west by the River Colne, which separates it from Denham in Bucking hamshire ; on the south by Hillingdon, and on the east by Ickenham and Rislip. The Village is situated on rising ground, about 290 feet above the level of the sea, four miles from Uxbridge, three from Rickmans worth, and nineteen from London. The Parish of Harefield, with a population of 1579, contains 4,620\" 3r V, of which 3,087\" 0r 28* are Pasture and Meadow, 948\" are Arable, 349\" are wood, 85\u00b0 Sites for Houses, Cottages, Gardens, etc., 75\" Water, and 73\u00b0 2r 19p Public Roads and Paths. By a survey taken in 1592, it was found that there were 518 acres of Heath, Moor, and Waste, of which Harefield Moore and Cowmoor together, contained 355a. The Grand Junction Canal no passes through these Moors from north to south. The soil to the south and east of the Parish is a strong clay, (the London clay) favourable to the growth of elm ; towards the north and west we come upon the Woolwich beds, and quite at the north west the chalk crops out."], [20, "2 The water is mostly from surface -springs ; there are, however, one or two deep wells. One at Breakspear, the water of which rises from the second bed of flints in the chalk. There formerly existed a very famous spring called Gulch Well, rising from a vein of chalk near the Colne. It was once proposed to bring this water to London, but the Grand Junction Canal was carried over it and the name of the spring is now almost forgotten. A line drawn from the River Colne at Watford, 170 feet above high water mark, and continued at an inclination of 13 feet in the mile, cuts the Water Level of all the Wells in the district, till Kilburn occurs where there is a depression. North of the Colne an inclined line rising from Watford, 200 feet in 14 miles, cuts the Water Level of the Wells dug in the chalk. In the year 1737, Mr. Blackstone pubhshed an account of indigenous plants growing in this Parish, under the title of \" Fasci culus plantarum circa Harefield nascentium.\" Among the more rare are \u2014 Dentaria bulbifera, Lathr\u0153a squaruaria, Aquilegia Vulgaris Cardamine Amara, Fritillaria Meleagris, Ophrys Muscifera, Ophrys Apifera, Saxifraga granulata, Parnassia palustris, Drosera rotundifolia Campanula hybrida, Utricularia Minor, Adoxa Moschatellina. Some few fossils are found in the chalk pits near the River. The lime from this chalk is of the very best quality, it was used at Windsor Castle when the great alterations were made there by George IV. The chalk rises abruptly about 100 feet on the east side of the Colne river, and north of the Harefield Mills. These Mills are mentioned in Domesday book as then existing. In a deed of 1370, a Fulling Mill is mentioned as belonging to Sir Simon de Swanland,"], [21, "3 and another deed of the date of 1518 speaks of Cripses Fulling Mill. In a deed of 1737, John Newdigate lets to William Henman \"the Paper Mill and the Corn Mill\" on the River Colne, and in 1752 Sir George Cooke purchased these Mills with other property from Sir Roger Newdigate. In 1781 George John Cooke, Esq., let to the Governors Assistants and Societies of the Mines Royal, \"all those Mills, late Paper Mills, and Corn Mills being by the waterside at Harefield, and also a newly erected house standing near the said Mills, etc \" The Mines Royal Company converted these Paper Mills into Copper Mills in 1802, and a new lease was granted, (the Canal having been made) they were then much enlarged under the direction of Robert George Spedding, Esq. The Copper for these Mills was brought from the smelting works in Glamorganshire, and here converted into sheets, bottoms, bolts, and bars. When in full work they manufactured about 30 tons a week. It is said that the copper ball of St. Paul's was made at these works. In 1863 the Mines Royal ceased working ; from that time the Mills were left in a most neglected state, the speculator who took them on the recommendation of the Mines Royal Company having become a bankrupt. In September 1870, Mr. Thomas Newell, from Paris, took them, and has again converted them into Paper Mills, for the manufacture of Envelopes. (In Domesday Book, wherever a Mill is mentioned, we generally find it still subsisting. They belonged to the Lords of the Manor, and the Tenant was permitted to grind his corn at the Lords Mill.)"], [22, "4 The Manor of Harefield is thus described in Domesday book \u2014 \" Richard, son of Gilbert the Earl (of Briou), holds Herefelle, which \" is taxed at five hides. The land is five carucates. Two hides are \" in demesne, on which there are two ploughs. The Villans have \" three ploughs. The Priest has one virgate ; there are five Villans \" who hold a virgate each ; and other five have each half a virgate ; \" Seven bordars who have five acres each, and one bordarwho has \"three acres; there are three cottars and three slaves, two Mills \" yielding 15s. rent, four fisheries yielding 1000 eels, meadow equal \" to one carucate, pasture for 1000 cattle, and pannage for 1200 hogs. \" The total annual value is \u00a312, it was only \u00a38 when entered upon \" by the present owner ; in King Edward's (the Confessor) time (being \" then the property of the Countess Goda) it was \u00a314.\" [The Hyde was the measure of Land in the Confessor's reign, the carucate that of the Conqueror's new standard. The carucate is a ploughland, viz. : as much arable as could be managed with one plough, and the beasts belonging thereto in one year ; having meadow, pasture, and hou-es for the householders and cattle belong ing to it. The measure of the carucate was various, sometimes estimated at 60 acres, and sometimes as much as 180, according to tillage. The Hyde was sometimes 4, sometimes 8 virgates of 20 acres each.] It appears by a quo warranto (a writ which lies against him who holds a court Baron or court Leet without Title) which bears date 1284, that Roger de Bacheworth was then Lord of the Manor of Harefield, and that he and his ancestors had enjoyed it with all its rights and privileges, from time immemorial. Amongst the evidences"], [23, "5 pertaining to the Harefield Park Estate, is a deed indorsed Knights Cortes, whereby Prior Alexander and the Convent of Hurley granted their Manor in Harefield with all their lands in Harefield and Eykemesworth to Richard Weltekart of Louth (de Luda), Thomas his son, and Florence the wife of the same Thomas, to hold to them, and the heirs of Thomas of the chief Lords of the fee for ever, paying 100 marks for the same. In witness whereof, etc., etc., etc., Ricardo de Bachesworth, Roger de Bachesworth, Thomas de Saunford, John de Schorne, Roberto de Ascheleye, Simon de Rushlep, Johan Haket, Willmo' Ravenyng, Stephno Aleyn. The common seal of the convent is attached to this deed and is in very fine preservation. (It is engraved in the Journal of the Arch\u00e6ological Institute, vol. 8, p. I >4). There is no date to this deed, but 31, Edw. I. (1306) Alex- ander de Newport was Prior of the Benedictine Priory of St. Mary of Hurley, Berks, which was founded in the reign of the Conqueror, by Geoffrey de Magna-Villa. The Priory was a cell to the Abbey of Westminster, and at the dissolution of Religious Houses by Henry VIII. was valued at \u00a3134 10s. 8Jd. Sir Richard de Bacheworth, in the year 1315, granted this Manor of Harefield to Simon de Swanland, who married the daughter and co-heir of his brother Roger. This Sir Richard afterward took upon him the habit of the Knights Hospitallers, and his wife Mar- garet, who had dower assigned her in Harefield, took the veil. William, Son of Sir Simon de Swanland, had three Sons, two of whom died in infancy, and the third, William Jun., left no issue. Joanna, the only daughter, married John Newdegate, who was after-"], [24, "6 wards knighted and a fleur-de-lis was given to him as a crest for his services during the wars of Edward III, against France. William de Swanland, the elder, died in 1395, when his only surviving Son William became Lord of Harefield, and as before stated, died without issue, leaving the Lordship of the Manor of Harefield to his widow Dyonisia for life, and after her death, 23 Henry VI, 1444-5, the Manor passed to William Newdegate, the grandson of John Newdegate and Joanna de Swanland. (see Records of the Honour of Clare.) In 1317, Sir Simon de Swanland had a charter of Free- Warren. (Cart. 10 Edwd. II. No. 36.) Confirmations of Free-Warren in this Manor were granted by Cart. 1 Edwd. III. No. 74, and Pat. 17, Rich. $t., pr. 2. No. 42. Roger Mortimer, fourth Earl of Marsh, who was killed in Ireland, 1398, and who inherited the \"Honour of Clare \" by his grandmother Elizabeth (daughter and heir of William de Burgh, Son and heir of Join de Burgh by Elizabeth, third daughter of Gilbert de Clare, seventh Earl of Hertford and third Earl of Gloucester) in a deed by which he obtained exemption from toll, pontage, etc., all over the Kingdom for the tenants of the Manor of Harefield, styled himself Lord of the Manor, but the full possession of the Manor, with all its rights and privileges, was then vested in the Swanlands, they paying to him as Lord Paramount, by reason of his possessing the \" Honour of Clare \" a quit rent of \u00a318 8d. and an additional payment of 3s. 4d. for being released from suit at the Court of the Honour. This quit rent was paid to the Crown (in which the \" Honour of Clare,\" as parcel of the Duchy of Lancaster had long been vested) till 1790 ; when by virtue of an Act of Parliament passed 26 Geo. III. Sir Roger Newdigate"], [25, "7 obtained a release and disfranchisement under the Great Seal of the Duchy. (When several Manors were held under one great Baron, His Seigniory over them was termed an \" Honour \" of whicii Stephens in his commentaries says there were 80 in England.) The CASTLE of CLARE continued vested in the crown until it was granted by Edward VI. to Sir John Cheke. I cannot ascertain when it was destroyed, but nothing now remains of it but some con siderable embankment*, and a conical mounds which was partly cut down in 1866 in making a station on the Cambridge and Colchester branch of the Great Eastern Railway, at which time a very remark able Gold Cross was found, appended to a gold chain of corded links about two feet long. It is now in possession of Her Majesty the Queen, who graciously permitted it to be exhibited at the monthly meeting of the Royal Arch\u00e6ological Institute on the 6th Dec. 1867, and of which there is a very interesting account by Mr. Albert Way in their quarterly Journal, No. 97. The site of Clare Castle is now owned by the Rev. Stephen Jenner. The Manor of Harefield continued in the Newdigate family until 1585, when John Newdigate, Esq. the seventh in descent from Sir John, who married Joanna Swanland, exchanged the Manor and Lands of Harefield (with the exception of Brackenbarys Farm) with Sir Edmund Anderson, Lord Chief Justice of Common Pleas, for the Manor and Lands of Arbury in Warwickshire, where Sir Edmond had recently erected a quadrangular stone mansion upon the site of the dissolved Priory of Erdbury, a Priory of Black Canons, valued at the dissolution at \u00a3122 8s. 6d. Sir Edmund Anderson in 1601, sold Harefield to Alice Countess Dowager of Derby, who in October, 1600"], [26, "8 had married Sir Thomas Egerton, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. He was the natural Son of Sir Ralph Egerton, of Cheshire, and born at Duddleston in 1540. Lord Campbell in his lives of the Chancellors says of him \u2014 \" It is refreshing now to have to contemplate the life of a man remarkable alike for talent, learning and probity, who raised himself from obscurity by his own exertions, and who reached the highest honours without affixing any stain on his character, and with merit so acknowledged that he did not even excite the enmity of rivals.\" In 1581, Egerton became Solicitor General, and in this capacity framed the indictment against Mary Queen of Scots. The Manor and Land of Harefield were settled upon Lady Derby for life, and after her death upon Lady Anne, Lady Francis, and Lady Elizabeth Stanley her daughters in succession. The Lord Keeper died 1617, being then Baron Ellesmere and Viscount Brackley. The Countess of Derby died 1637. Lady Anne Stanley, the eldest daughter, married Grey Lord Chandos, who died 1621, she then married (1624) Mervin, Earl of Castlehaven, who was beheaded in 1631. She died 1647, when George Lord Chandos (her eldest son by her first hus band) inherited the Manor of Harefield in accordance with the deed of 1601. This was the famous George Bruges, 6th Baron Chandos, who distinguished himself during the civil war, and especially at the Battle of Newbury where he had three horses killed under him. For his great valour in this battle, King Charles offered him the Earldom of Newbury, which he modestly declined until it pleased God to restore his Majesty: this he did not live to see. He was twice married, first to Susan, daughter of Henry Earl of Manchester, who died 1752 leaving two daughters, and secondly to Jane, daughter of"], [27, "9 John Savage Earl Rivers, by whom he had three daughters. In the year 1652 Lord Chandos had a difference with Colonel Henry Comp ton, grandson of Henry Lord Compton, which unhappily ended in a duel at Putney Heath on the 13th May, when Colonel Compton fell. His Lordship, and his second, Lord Arundel of Wardour, having been imprisoned more than a year, were at length arrainged in the upper bench, 17th May, 1654, and found guilty of manslaughter. He then returned to Harefield where he lived in retirement. The excellent Dr. John Conant being his domestic Chaplain. He died of Small Pox in February, 1655 without issue Male ; aged 35 ; and was buried at Sudeley, leaving all his Manor and Lands at Harefield to his wife Jane, who the same year married Sir Willim Sedley, Bart., and he dying the year afterwards she contracted a third marriage in 1637, with George Pitt of Strathfieldsay. In 1673 she made over all her estates to her husband and his heirs, and in February, 1674, George Pitt sold Harefield Place together with the Manor of Harefield and Moorhall to Sir Richard Newdigate of Arbury, the first Bart. So that after only ninety years alienation, the Harefield estate and Manor again became the property of the Newdigates. The before mentioned Dr. John Conant was born 18th Oct., 1608, he was dis tinguished for his piety, leading an exemplary life. In December, 1654, he was admitted Divinity professor at Oxford, and in 1657 became Vice-Chancellor ; he died 12th March, 1692, aged 86. Harefield Place, situated to the south of the Church, was the ancient Mansion of the Lords of the Manor. In was first inhabited by the Newdigates, then by the Lord Chief-Justice Anderson, and afterwards by the Lord Keeper Egerton, and upon his death by his 2"], [28, "10 widow Alice Countess of Derby, who was the youngest daughter of Sir John Spencer, of Althorpe, who died 1586, (ancestor of the Duke of Marlborough and Earl Spencer), by Catherine, daughter of Sir Thomas Kitson, of Hengrave, Suffolk. Her first husband was Ferdinando, fifth Earl of Derby, who is stated to have been poisoned by the Jesuits in 1594, because he indignantly refused to assume the Title of King of England in right of his Grandmother Alianore, daughter and Co-Heir of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, and Mary Dowager Queen of France \u2014 the sister of King Henry VIII. She married her second husband, Sir Thomas Egerton, October, 1600. The following is a Copy of a letter from Sir Thomas Egerton to Lady Derby, which is preserved amongst the Newdigate papers in the muniment room at Arbury \u2014 \" To make true declaration to my most honorable Lady the Countess Dowager of Derby, that I desire not hers but herself, for her virtues and worth ; I am contented that she dispose, at her good pleasure, all that I may be inter ested in by her marriage, if God so bless it as I desire, so as myself, I, nor any by me, may anywise prejudice or hinder any person to whom she shall assign or appoint the same after her death \u2014 which I pray to God that I never live to see, and when, where my weak Estate be not sufficient to assure unto her such a jointure as she deserves and I desire ; my most humble and earnest suite is, that she accept for her jointure all the Manors and Lands in the Counties of Salope and Chester which I purchased of Mr. Edward Talbot, Esq. and all those other Manors and Land in the County of Salope which were late parcel of the possessions of her most noble and worthy husband the Earl of Derby, and which I have lately purchased. All the Lands which were the said Earl's of Derby, I will assure to Her and the Heirs male of our body ; all the rest of my land I will also assure to the Heirs male of my body, I will always desire to add such increase to that I shall appoint to her, as God shall enable me."], [29, "11 And will ever think all too little for so Honorable Virtuous and worthy a Lady.\" Thomas Egerton. Sir Rowland Whyte writing to Sir Robert Sidney, 24th October, 1600, says \u2014 \" Upon Tuesday Morning my Lord Keeper married the Countess Dowager of Darby, which is made known to the Queen, but how she takes it I do not heare. It is given out that his soune, Mr. John Egerton, shall marry her second daughter, and that the young Lord Hastings shall marry her third daughter.\" (Sidney papers, vol. ii, p. 219.) Both these marriages took place. It was on the occasion of Lady Derby's marriage with the Lord Keeper that Harrington wrote the following lines \u2014 \" This noble Countess lived many years, \" With Derby, one of England's greatest peers, \" Fruitful and faire, and of so clear a name, \" That all this region marveWd at her fame. \" But this brave Peer extinct by hasten' d fate, \" She lived, Ah ! too, too long, in w-idoiu's state ; \" And in that state took such sweet state upon her, \" All eares, eyes, tongues, heard, saw, and spoke her honour.\" There is a very rare engraved portrait of this Countess. There is no engraver's name. The Marquis of Bute is said to possess one. The Queen could not have been offended at their marriage, or she must have forgiven it very soon, for on the 31st July, 1602, she paid the Lord Keeper and Lady Derby a visit at Harefield Place, and remained two nights. Who were the persons who accompanied Her Majesty, I have not been able to ascertain ; but the following extract from the Egerton papers (published by the Camden Society) will give"], [30, "12 some idea of the vast preparations considered necessary for the Queen's reception \u2014 It is first mentioned that two hundred pounds were expended in preparing ovens, ranges, tents, etc., then come the following accounts. 31st July, lst and 2nd August, 1602.

In the volume of the Camden Society, containing the foregoing list, the Editor calls attention to one of the items which deserves notice. It is stated that Sir Thomas Lucy (against whom Shakespeare is said to have written a ballad) sent a present of a Buck. Now 3"], [36, "18 Malone discredits the whole story of the deer stealing, because Sir Thomas Lucy had no Park at Charlecote. \" I conceive, he says (Shakespeare by Boswell, II, 145) it will very readily be granted that Sir Thomas Lucy could not lose that of which he never was possessed.\" We see, however, that he was \"possessed of deer,\" for he sent a present of a Buck to Sir Thomas Egerton in 1602, tho' that was fifteen or twenty years after Shake speare (if it ever happened) had been punished for stealing his deer, and had avenged himself by writing the celebrated Ballad. In Nicholl's progresses of Queen Elizabeth, published 1823, is an extract from papers which belonged to the late Sir Roger Newdi gate, lettered \" Entertainment of Queen Ehzabeth at Harefield by the Countess of Derby,\" where it is mentioned that \" the Queen entered (out of the highway) into the Demesne Ground of Harefield near the Dairy house (now Dews farm) when she met two persons, the one representing a Bayliffe and the other a Dairy maid, who addressed Her Majesty in a complimentary speech. The Queen being on horseback remained to hear it, sheltered by a tree, as it was rain ing heavily. Her Majesty afterwards proceeded to the house and alighting from her horse ascended three steps near the house where a carpet and chair were set for her. Two allegorical persons representing Time and Place, then presented themselves and addressed her in a long dialogue to which Her Majesty patiently listened.\" A poem was pre sented to Her Majesty, beginning \" Beauty's Rose and Virtues Book, \"Angel's mind and Angel's look.\" The Queen being sixty-nine years of age !"], [37, "19 From this time till her departure from Harefield we have but little account of what took place ; it seems to have rained the whole time she remained. By the Egerton papers we see that a Bear had been brought down from London for her Majesty's entertainment, (probably to be baited). There was also a lottery, where lots were drawn all numbered, denoting different articles with a couple of lines in metre, which were handed to the fortunate drawers in the Queen's presence, of which the following have been selected \u2014 A Handkekchief. \" Whether you seem to weep, or tveep indeed, This Handkerchief will stand you well instead.\" A Fan. \" You love to see, and yet to be unseen, Take you this fan, to be your beauty's screen.\" A Looking Glass. \" Blind fortune doth not see how fair you be, But gives a Glass that you yourself may see.\" A Blank. \" Nothing's your lot, that's more than can be told, For nothing is more precious than gold.\" In Masson's life of Milton, it is recorded that Shakespeare's Othello was here first publicly performed before Her Majesty by (l Bur bidge's players,\" specially brought to Harefield for that purpose. Shakespeare himself, then 38 years of age, being almost certainly among them."], [38, "20 One of the charges for the entertainment of Her Majesty, taken from the Egerton papers is \u00a310 for Burbidge players of Othello. At Her Majesty's departure the allegorical person representing Place attired in mourning made her a farewell address, from which the following is an extract \u2014 \" Sweet Majestie, be pleased to look upon a poor wydow mourning before your Grace ; I am this Place, which at your coming was full of Joy, but now at your departure am as full of sorrow,\" and a great deal more in the same strain, ending with \" My only Suyte before you go, is that you will pardon the close imprisonment which you have suffered ever since your coming, imputing it not to me but to St. Swythen, who of late hath rayzed so many storms, as I was faine provide this Anchor for you, when I did understand you would put into this Creeke. But now since I perceive this harbour is too little for you, and you will Hoyst sayle and be gone ; I beseech you take this Anchor with you. And I pray to Him that made both Time and Place, that in all places, wherever you shall arrive, you may anchor as safely as you doe, and ever shall doe, in the harte of my owners.\" The anchor here mentioned is the one for which with other matters the Goldsmith was paid \u00a38, (see Egerton papers). On the 24th of March, 1603, Queen Elizabeth died, aged 70. Sir Thomas Egerton after assisting in proclaiming King James I, met His Majesty at Broxburne, in the County of Hertford, and presented him with the Great Seal \u2014 which the King immediately returned. Sir Thomas was then made Lord High Chancellor, and created Baron Ellesmere. In 1616 he was raised to the Viscouncy of Brackley; the following year he resigned the Lord Chancellorship (being sue-"], [39, "21 ceeded by Lord Bacon) and died soon after, aged 77, leaving landed property to the amount of \u00a38,000 a year. He was buried at Ormes kirke. Alice, Countess Dowager of Derby, survived her husband Viscount Brackley nineteen years, residing at Harefield where she died on the 26th of January, 1637, and lies buried in the Chancel of Harefield Church. By her will dated the 24th December, 1636, amongst other bequests charged upon her estates generally she left \u00a325 a year for ever to the Incumbent or Curate of the Parish. She also left a charge of \u00a336 a year as follows, viz. : \u00a330 a year to be divided amongst six old women residing in her Alms Houses; \u00a31 a year for the repairs of the said Alms Houses ; and \u00a35 a year to the Curate as master to read the service or some prayers daily to them. The Lord of the Manor of Harefield to appoint to the vacancies as they occur. The original Mansion which stood near the church was burnt down in 1660. Tradition says the fire was occasioned by the carelessness of the witty Sir Charles Sedley, who was amusing himself by reading in bed. The house was rebuilt by uniting the two Lodges of the old house by an intermediate building; this was done about 1680, by Sir Richard Newdigate the second Baronet, whose widow resided in it for several years. On the 26th February, 1674, Sergeant Sir Richard Newdigate (who the 3rd February had repurchased the Manors and Estates of Harefield and Moor Hall from George Pitt, Esq.) by deed altered the bequest of Lady Derby as to the Alms Houses, and in lieu thereof enfeoffed several persons (named as Trustees) of Baldwin Hall and certain pieces of Land to the use of the said Trustees and their heirs,"], [40, "22 to the intent and purpose that they might yearly receive out of the Rents and Profits, thirty-six pounds per annum over and above all Taxes, to be applied to the charitable use therein mentioned and subject thereto to the use of Sir Richard Newdigate, his heirs and assigns, Lords of the Manor of Harefield for ever. The said pre mises were in 1750 vested in Mr. Haw'cre, the sole surviving Trustee. In 1750, Sir Roger Newdigate, Bart., the descendant and heir of Sir Richard, entered into an agreement with George Cooke, Esq., Chief Prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas, to sell to him certain farms, messuages, mills, tithes, tenements, etc., etc., and amongst them was Baldwin's Hall and the several pieces of Land named in the deed of 1674. This sale was completed the 23rd November, 1752, and the Great Great Nephew of the above named George Cooke \u2014 William Frederick Vernon, Esq., now in possession of the Harefield Park Estate, pays the six old women in the Alms Houses, and the Curate as master, and the \u00a31 a year for repairs ; but the Lord of the Manor appoints to all vacancies notwithstanding. Sir Roger Newdigate, the fifth and last Baronet, was the youngest Son of Sir Edward Newdigate who died in 1727 ; He was a King's scholar in Westminster, where, by his own choice, he remained three years and became a Member of University College. He made the tour of France and Italy. Soon after his return he was elected M.P. for Middlesex upon the vacancy created by The Rt. Hon. William Pulteney becoming Earl of Bath in 1742. In 1743 he married Sophia, daughter of Edward Conyers, of Copt Hall, Co. Essex, Esq. After many years of bad health she died in 1774, and was buried at Harefield where is her monument, a white marble vase with a female"], [41, "23 figure in basso relievo recumbent, on the top an angel leaning on an extinguished torch, on a tablet underneath is the following inscription : fn Slciraira Of his most truly amiable, much and long loved wife, SOPHIA, LADY NEWDIGATE, Daughter of Edward Conyers, of Copped Hall, Essex, Esquire, by Matilda, daughter of WILLIAM, BARON LAMPSTEB, Born December 20th, 1718. Married May 31st, 1743. Died July 9th, 1774. Sir Roger Newdigate, Baronet, with many tears erected this monument. In 1776, he married his second Lady, Hester, daughter of Edward Mundy, of Shipley, County Derby. On the 31st January, 1750, upon a vacancy made by Lord Cornbury being called to the House of Peers, Sir Roger Newdigate had the honour to be returned a Burgess for the University of Oxford, and continued their Member till 1780, when he retired from public life. / In 1760, having fixed his residence in Warwickshire, he sold Harefield Place and the Land immediately around it (retaining the Manor and his other Estates in the Parish) to John Truesdale, Esq., and in 1780 it was purchased of Mr. Truesdale's executors by William"], [42, "24 Baynes, Esq., who died 1798, and was succeeded by his Son, Sir Christopher Baynes, Bart., who re-sold the house near the church and a portion of the land to Jane, widow of Charles Parker, Esq., who shortly afterwards (about the year 1814) pulled it down. There is an engraving of it in Lyson's extra volume of the History of Middlesex. Evelyn in his Sylva mentions a Silver fir planted by Lady Derby at Harefield Place in 1603 (at two year's growth) which had, in 1679 attained the height of 81 feet and measured 13 feet in girth. In 1786 Sir Roger Newdigate built Harefield Lodge, one mile from Uxbridge, but he usually resided at Arbury in Warwickshire. Though twice married, he died without issue, 25th November, 1806, at 87. He left his estates of Arbury and Harefield to Charles New digate Parker, Esq., the Grandson of William Parker of Salford Prior, County Warwick, and Millicent Newdigate, first cousin of Sir Roger. The present Charles Newdigate Newdegate, M.P. for North Warwick shire, now owner of Arbury and Harefield, and Lord ofthe Manor, is the only Son of the late Charles Newdigate Parker, who took the name of Newdegate on the death of Sir Roger, and died in 1833. Sir Roger Newdigate was a great benefactor to the University of Oxford. The admired Cast of the Florentine Boar in Queen's College Library ; The Florentine Museum and other books in the Library of University College ; Piranesi's works in the Bodleian, and those exquisite specimens of ancient sculpture, the Candelabras in the Ratcliffe Library (which cost \u00a31800) were some of his donations. (Gen. Mag, vol. 77, part 2, page 706) He also founded the Newde gate Prize at Oxford, by giving \u00a31000 to be vested in the public funds in the name of the Vice-Chancellor and Master of the Univer-"], [43, "25 sity College for the time being, in trust ; part of it to go for an annual prize for English Verses on ancient sculpture, painting, and architecture, and the remainder to accumulate as part of a fund towards the amendment of the lodgings of the Master of University College. He stipulated that in the verses there should be no com pliment to himself, and that the number of lines should not exceed fifty, as he observed \" our greatest fault in writing, is want of com pression.\" The first prize was gained by Mr. Wilson of Magdalen College in 1806. Manor of Moor Hall. The Manor of Moor Hall was given by a deed in the twelfth century to the Preceptory of Knights Hospitallers at Harefield by Alice, daughter of Baldwin de Clare. The words of the deed are \" Confirmavi Deo, Beat\u00e6 Mari\u00e6, et Sancto Johanni Baptistce, et Sanct\u00e6 Domus in territorio de Herfeld,\" etc. Certain lands described in boundaries, and these lands are said to form the Manor of Moor Hall. Who founded the Priory I have not been able to ascertain, but it was a cell to the Priory of St. John's, Clerkenwell, as is evident from a lawsuit relating to this Manor in the fourth year of Edward III, 1330-1, (recorded in the Newdigate Cartulary) in which the parties are Sir Simon de Swanland, Lord of Harefield, and the Prior of St. John of Jerusalem in England. There is also in the same Cartulary a deed of Sir Roger Bacheworth, who was Lord of the Manor of Harefield in 1284, which gives ten acres of Harefield Moor to the brethren of St. John of Jerusalem at the instance of Nicholas Daccombe, who is called Preceptor domus Hospitalis de Herfeld. The site of the old Preceptory is now occupied by a Farm house 4"], [44, "26 inhabited by day labourers. The Refectory, the walls of which are standing, is of stone and flint with three lancet windows in the east end, now built up. Upon the abolition of the Knights Hospitallers in England, this Manor was granted by Henry VIII, the 34th of his reign, to Robert Tyrwhit, Esq., who the same year, 1542-3, conveyed it to John Newdigate and John his son. It has since passed with the Manor of Harefield. \" Whensoever the Knights Templars or Hospi tallers had any considerable Manor or Farm, they built a convenient house, to which they sent part of their fraternity under the command of a Preceptor, and these houses were called Preceptories or Com manderies.\" (see Summary of Religious Houses, 8vo. 1717, p. 20.) Brakenbury. In the year 1349, Sir Thomas de Samford, or as he is called in some deeds Saunford, held a messuage and lands in Harefield. This Estate soon after became the property of the Swan lands by the intermarriage of Sir Simon de Swanland with Joan the daughter and heir of Sir Thomas de Samford. In 1356, William de Swanland granted a lease of this Estate to Thomas de Brakenburgh, from whom it acquired the name of Brakenburgh or Brakenburyes, and in some records is called erroneously the Manor of Brakenburgh. It passed with the Manor of Harefield from the Swanlands to the family of Newdigate, and has ever since been in their uninterrupted possession, not having been included in the deed of exchange between Sir Edmund Anderson and John Newdigate. It is now a Farm house with a moat round three sides. The south Aisle of the Harefield Church, which is the ancient burial place of the Newdigate family, is called the Brakenburgh Chapel.

Breakspear. Breakspear, an ancient Mansion in this Parish is said by Camden to have been so called from a family of that name, one of whom, Nicholas Breakspear was elected Pope, 3rd December, 1154, on the death of Anastatius the fourth, and assumed the Title of Adrian the fourth. He died in 1159, 30th August, said to have been choked by a fly. Few of Adrian's Bulls are dated in the year of his Pontificate. In some of them, he indicated the Bank which he held among Popes of his own name by styling himself Adrian the fourth, which custom had then fallen into desuetude. He sometimes commenced the year on the lst of January, sometimes on the 25th March, and sometimes followed the Pisan calculation, which was occasionally used in France, especially in the twelfth century. It differed only from our common era by preceding it by one year. In 1371, William de Swanland granted a lease of sixty years to William Brekspere of a house and lands in Harefield which had been held by John Grove in bondagio. Early in the fifteenth century, Breakspere was in possession of George Ashby, Esq., Clerk of the Signet to Margaret of Anjou, Queen of Henry VI. (1422-70) He died at Breakspear 1474, and was buried in Harefield Church. The Estate continued in this family till late in the eighteenth century, when Elizabeth, daughter of Bobert Ashby, Esq., on the death of her brother Bobert in 1767, and of her Father in 1769, became sole heiress, and the following year she"], [48, "28 married Joseph Partridge, Esq., of St. James's, who died 3rd Jan uary, 1793, leaving a son Josepb Ashby Partridge his heir, who was bom 1775, and in 1838 married Anne Catherine Drake, and dying in 1857, age 82 without issue, left the property to William Wickham Drake, Esq., eldest son of the Bev. Wickham Drake of Malpas, Cheshire, by Eliza, daughter of Thomas Tarieton of Bolesworth Castle. William Wickham Drake, Esq., born 1809, married in 1856, Mary Agnes, daughter of the late John Harcourt Powell, Esq., of Driiikstone Park, Suffolk. Harefield Park. This Estate was the creation of George Cooke, Esq., Chief Prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas, the first of tbe Cookes who settled at Harefield, after his marriage in 1700. He was the youngest of twelve children of John Cooke, Esq., of Swifts and Cranbrook, County Kent, by Mary Warren of Cheshire. He commenced the formation of the present Estate by the purchase of an ancient house called Byes or Bythes and about 170 acres of land from John Stanyan Gent., lst February, 1704. Before his death, wbich occurred in 1740, he built the present house, planted the ornamental timber, made the garden, and added about 200 more acres of land purchased at different times. Amongst his purchases was a small tenement with stables and orchard with three acres of land, called Belhamonds, which he purchased in 1713. Hetben gave that name to his own house. In 1752, his son, George Cooke, Esq., M.P. for Middlesex, added several farms with about 400 acres of land and also the Mills on the Colne, which he purchased from Sir Boger Newdigate, Bart., and in 1758 he purchased the Evesden farm and"], [49, "29 fishery from William Ashby of Breakspear. In 1824, General Sir George Cooke, the Grandson of the last mentioned George Cooke, added to his Estate the farm called Weybeards or Hamonds, which he purchased from the executors of Bobert George Spedding, Esq., late manager of the Copper Mills. And about this time the name of Sir George Cooke's residence was changed to Harefield Park. After the death of Sir George and his brother, Sir Henry Cooke, S.P., and the second marriage of Sir Henry Cooke's widow, the property came to William Frederick Vernon, Esq., the nephew of Sir Henry Cooke. The House was let for many years, and became very much out of repair, till in 1862 the present owner of the property having tho roughly restored it and made it a comfortable residence, came to live there himself. The views from the Park which is well timbered are much admired. There is a very fine grove of Ilex of considerable size in the Park. Close to the house, at the south end of the Terrace, is a fine Statue in white marble (believed to be by Bysbrack) of Sir George Cooke, chief Prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas, who founded the Estate. He died suddenly at his chambers in the Temple in 1740, and was buried at Hayes Church, Middlesex, of which Manor he was Lord."], [50, "30 On the Pedestal of this Statue are the following inscriptions.

Harefield Lodge, the seat of Charles Newdigate Newdegate, Esq., M.P., the lord of the Manor, was built by Sir Boger Newdigate, Bart., in 1786, as a dower house, he having sold Harefield Place in 1760.

It is now let, its owner living at Arbury in Warwickshire."], [52, "32 Harefield Grove, is the property of Joseph Boord, Esq., who purchased it about three years ago from Bobert Barnes, Esq., of Manchester, who had been in possession of it for about six years, and who had expended a large sum upon it, greatly improving both the House and Estate. In a deed of the 12th May, 1684, it is described by the name of \" Guttersdean Farm as a copyhold messuage with orchard, etc., etc., and 65 acres of Coppyhold land of which about 10 acres are wood, and also 67 acres of Freehold land, of which 28 acres are wood and now (1684) in the Tenure of Bichard Herbert.\" By this deed George Pitt of Strathfieldsay sells the whole of the Great and Small Tithes arising, etc., on the said Farm Lands, etc., to Nathaniel Saunders. It has changed hands more frequently than any estate in this Parish. In 1804, the Bev. S. Barnard resided5 there and kept a School. It was afterwards the property of Major Bichard Aylmer Haly from about 1809 to 1819. It then came into the possession of Mr. Flower, and about the year 1830, it was purchased by Mr. Morgan, a Bussian Merchant, who greatly improved the house and laid out the grounds. Upon his death it was pur chased by Lord Ebury, who shortly afterwards sold it (retaining some of the woods) to Bobert Barnes, Esq., and from him it was purchased in 1869 by the present possessor. Harefield House, now the property of the Honourable Sir John Byles, Judge of the court of Common Pleas, belonged early in the present century to Philip Champion de Crespigny, Esq., (the second son of Philip Champion de Crespigny, M.P. for Aldeburgh, Suffolk, who died 1803). This Philip Champion de Crespigny the son, died without issue in 1851, aged 86, and was succeeded by his Nephew,"], [53, "33 Charles Champion de Crespigny, who sold the property to Captain Cecil Dunn Gardner of Cambridgeshire, from whom it was purchased in 1859 by the present owner. Before Mr. Crespigny became the possessor of Harefield House, it was the residence of George, Count Bruhl, Envoy from the Court of Saxony to England, who, the 8th July, 1767, married Alicia Maria, the daughter of Lord Carpenter, and widow of Charles Earl of Egremont who died 1763. The Countess died in 1794, and is buried in Harefield Church. In 1796 Count Bruhl purchased Weybeard's Farm, alias Hamonds, with 36 acres of land, and went to reside there till 1807, when he sold it to Mr. Spedding. He died in Essex in 1809, aged 72, but was buried by his wife in Harefield Church, (see Begister). The Parish Church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and situated about a half-a-mile from the Village, in the centre of the Park of Old Harefield Place, is built of flint and stone with a square tower at the north west corner. It is of great antiquity (value about \u00a375 a year) in the gift of Charles Newdigate Newdegate, Esq., M.P., who has refitted and restored it at an outlay of upwards of \u00a33000. The Church now affords accommodation for 550 persons. The interior consists of a Chancel very much raised (on each side of which are two rows of seats appropriated to the use of the Lord of the Manor), a Nave, and two Aisles, with a gallery for the organ and choir over a portion of the north aisle. The east end of the south Aisle, is the old Brackenburg Chapel, and the east end of the north Aisle, is the old Breakspear Chapel, screened off from the Church and occupied as a pew by the owners of Breakspear. There is a \"private entrance to this Chapel in the 5"], [54, "34 north wall of the Church. The owners of the Harefield Park Estates have a large pew at the extreme west of the Church, now made into two, and a pew on each side of it for the servants ; and for which pews, with a family vault underneath, the owners of the Harefield Park Estate possess a Faculty granted the 23rd December, 1715. There is also a pew belonging to Harefield House, now the property of Mr. Justice Byles, formerly called Dobyn's house, sold by Sir Boger Newdigate, 1752. This pew is the second from the chancel on the left hand side of the nave. The Mills have also a pew appropriated to them. This pew is the one nearest the chancel on the left side of the nave. The advowson of the Church was formerly given to the Knight's Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem, by Beatrice de Boilers, relict of Baldwin, Fitz Geoffrey (see Dugdale's Monast Ang :). The Bishop seems never to have had any jurisdiction in this Parish, which is a peculiar, and the Church a donative, in the hands of the Lord of the Manor, who appoints the Incumbent ; and formerly could (it is said) displace him at pleasure ; but Bishop Blomfield having obtained an Act of Parliament giving the Bishops a certain jurisdiction over all peculiars, the Incumbent (called vicar since 1850,) must now (after his appointment by the Patron) be instituted by the Bishop, and can no longer be removed at the will of the Patron. The ancient stipend of the Curate or Incumbent was \u00a36 13s. 4d. But in 1637 Alice, Countess Dowager of Derby, left by her will a charge upon her estate at Harefield of \u00a325 a year for ever to the Incumbent ; and gave in addition \u00a35 per annum, a house and a small piece of land, to the Curate as master of her Alms Houses, on condition of his reading"], [55, "35 prayers to the poor women. And this \u00a330 a year, together with the Easter offerings, is said to be all that the Incumbent is legally entitled to. The Patron claiming all fees as his right. There is now a very good Vicarage House with about 8 acres of Glebe land surrounding it. The Lord of the Manor gave the land, and the House was built by subscription in 1855, costing \u00a31,600, of which Queen Anne's bounty contributed \u00a3200; Pyncombe's Charity \u00a3100; the Bishop of London \u00a320, and the rest was subscribed by the Parish ioners. The Lord of the Manor and the owner of Breakspear Estate giving one half of it. The year following, (1856) the Lord of the Manor added the Stables, and enclosed the north side of the kitchen garden with a wall. The Tithes of this Parish were appropriated to the Hospitallers, and the Church became a Donation in their hands. In the old Valors the Bectory was valued at \u00a38 13s. 4d., but was exempted from taxation. In 1548 it was valued at \u00a320 per annum (see Chantry roll for Middlesex in the Augmentation office). After the dissolution of Beligious Houses, the Bectory and Advowson were granted 34 Henry VIII, 1542-3 to Bobert Tyrwhit, who the same year conveyed them to John Newdegate and John his Son. The advowson has since passed with the Manor, but the greater part of the Tithes were not included in Sergeant Newdegate's re purchase, but were sold to different persons by George Pitt and George his Son between the years 1683 and 1695. In 1649, Harefield was returned as \" One Parsonage impropriate \" to the Lord Chandos in fee, who hath the right of patronage, and \" we consider the same to be worth about \u00a3140 per annum in small"], [56, "36 \" and great Tithes, and find that by order of the Committee at \" Goldsmith's Hall, upon the said Lord Chandos his composition, he \" is to allow towards the mayntenance of an able Minister amongst \" us the yearly sum of \u00a3100, which is of late settled upon one \" Mr. Hoare, our present Incumbent and constant preaching \" Minister.\" (see Parliamentary Survey of Church Lands, MSS., Lambeth, page 187-8). The Bepublican party made Lord Chandos pay \u00a33,973 as composition for his Estates. In 1845, the Commissioners, under the Tithe commutation Act, found \u2014 That the Parish of Harefield consists of about 4,513\u00b0 3r 26p whereof 11\u00b0 3r B6P by estimation were gravel pits, Churchyard, sites of houses and waste.

The map with the Plots of Ground all numbered with the Schedule annexed, together with the award of the Commissioners commuting the said Tithe into- a Bent Charge for ever, is in the Church chest (1872). At the Commutation of Tithe in 1845, the value of Grain per imperial bushel was : Wheat, 7s. 0$d. Barley, 2s. ll|d. Oats, 2s. dd. At the south east corner of the chancel of the Church is a very handsome monument to the memory of Alice, Countess Dowager of Derby, who died in 1637. The monument exhibits the arms of Stanley with its quarterings, impaling the arms and quarterings of Spencer of Althorpe. There are the arms also of the Countess' three daughters, viz. : first, Lady Anne Stanley, who married Grey"], [58, "38 Lord Chandos, and afterwards the Earl of Castlehaven, who was beheaded on Tower Hill, 14th May, 1631. Second, Lady Francis Stanley, who married the Earl of Bridgwater ; and the third, Lady Elizabeth Stanley, who married Henry Earl of Huntingdon. An inscription on this monument states that Sir Thomas Egerton (who was the Countess of Derby's second husband) had by his first wife an only daughter Mary, who was Mother of Julian Lady Newdigate, (see Pedigree). On the south wall is an altar tomb (placed under an arch) to the memory of John Newdegate who died in 1528, and fixed upright in the wall are figures in brass of the deceased, with his eight sons and five daughters. On the same wall are the monuments of John New digate (fifth son of Sir Bichard Newdigate, Bart.) 1705 ; Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Twisden, Bart, and relict of Sir Bichard Newdigate, Bart., 1765 ; Sophia, daughter of Edward Conyers, Esq., and wife of Sir Boger Newdigate, Bart., 1774. On the east wall is a very handsome monument, designed and executed by Gibbons, the celebrated carver, in memory of Sir Bichard Newdigate, Bart., Sergeant at Law, who died 1710, and of Mary his wife, daughter of Sir Edward Bagot, who died 1692. On the north wall are the monuments of Sarah, wife of Bichard Newdigate, Esq., (son of Sir Bichard Newdigate, Bart.,) and daughter of Sir Cicil Bishop, Bart., 1695 ; Sir Bichard Newdigate her hus band, (who succeeded to the Title of Baronet and had married his second wife Elizabeth Twisden,) 1727 ; Sir Edward Newdigate, Bart., aged 18 years, 1734 ; Bichard and Charles his brothers, and Jane his sister, who all died young. The monument of Sir Bichard is orna-"], [59, "39 mented with a bust, and that of Sir Edward with a medallion of the deceased, in white marble. On the south west corner of the south aisle is an ancient altar tomb, which has neither inscription nor arms. In the north east is a table tomb, with figures in brass to the memory of John Newdigate, Sergeant at Law, who died 1545, and Amphilicia his wife (daughter of John Nevill, Esq., who died 1544), they had ten sons and four daughters. Against the south wall is a tablet with figures in brass to the memory of Editha (daughter of John Bowett, of Surrey, and relict of John Newdigate), died 1444. On the same wall are the monuments of Sir John Newdigate, Knt., (who married Anne daughter of Sir Edward Fitton) 1610, and John Newdigate his son and heir (who married Susan Luis) 1642. On the east wall of the Brackenburg Chapel is a monument to Bichard Newdigate, Sergeant at Law and Baronet, youngest son of Sir John Newdigate, Knt., born 17th September, 1602, died 14th October, 1678, leaving by Juliana his wife, the daughter of Francis Leigh, of Newnham Regis, County Warwick, (who died 14th October, 1685), three sons and two daughters surviving. This Sir Bichard was in great practice as a Sergeant at Law at the beginning of the rebellion, when his elder brother died, and he became heir to his Estates at Arbury and the Brackenburg farm at Harefield\u2014 both much encumbered. When Cromwell was declared Protector, he determined to govern by the laws of the land ; and for this purpose summoned some of the lawyers who were then most eminent at the bar ; amongst others, the great Sir Matthew Hale, and Serjeant Newdegate, but they both"], [60, "40 declined serving under him, declaring they could not act under his commission. He turned from them in wrath, saying, if you of the red robe will not execute the law, my red coats shall ; upon which they all cried out, \" Make us Judges, we will be Judges.\" On the 25th January, 1653-4, Matthew Hale was by writ made a Serjeant, and one of the justices of the Common Bench. On the 2nd June, 1654, three new judges were made, Serjeant Pepys, Serjeant Newdigate, and Serjeant Windham. Upon the question of the Sale of Crown Lands, the new Judge Newdigate declared no title could be made to them : and being sent the Northern Circuit, when Colonel Halsey and many Cavaliers who had been taken in arms in Scotland, were indicted at York for high treason, he declared from the Bench that he knew no law which made it high Treason to levy war against a Lord Protector. This drew upon him the indignation of Cromwell; and in May, 1655, he and Baron Thorpe were put out of their places for not observing the Protector's pleasure in all his commands, (Whitlocks Memorial). Being thus honorably displaced, he returned to the Bar. But on the 17th January 1660, he was made Chief Justice ofthe Upper Bench, and continued till the Bestoration, when his health being much impaired, he retired from public life, deservedly honored and respected by all who knew him. Some years after the Bestoration, at the instance of Lord Grandison, the Duke of Ormonde, and of Colonel Halsey, whose life he had saved at York, he had an audience of the King, who received him very graciously, and thanked him for his kindness to his friends in the worst of times. At the same time a warrant was issued for a patent of Baronetage ; \" which dignity,"], [61, "J- 41 \" says the patent, we confer upon him in consideration of several \" good services performed to us and our faithful subjects in the late \" usurpation.\" The usual fees were on this occasion remitted. In 1674 Sir Bichard repurchased of George Pitt the ancient family property with the Manors of Harefield and Moorhall and lived till his death in 1678 at the old House. On the west side of the Brackenbury Chapel are the monuments of Bobert Newdigate, Esq., 1695. He married first, Frances, daughter of Thomas Harrison, Esq. second, Juliana, daughter of Bobert Beale, Esq., who survived him, and died 1732. Bobert Newdigate, Esq., (son of Bobert and Juliana), 1723 ; and Diana, daughter of Benedict Ball, Esq., of Padmore in the Isle of Wight, by his wife Mary Stephens (grand-daughter of Sir Bichard Newdigate who married Mary Bagot) she died 1765, aged 18.

On the west wall of the arch leading into the Breakspear Chapel, is the monument of John Pritchett, Bishop of Gloucester, who died"], [63, "43 1680. He was the son of Walter Pritchett, Gen., Lord of the Manor of Cowley, in the Parish of Hillingdon ; and after having served the cure of this Parish nearly 30 years, was promoted to the See of Gloucester, 1672.

Underneath are the following lines : \" In frost and snow, thro' hail and rain, \" He scour'd the ivoods, cond trudged the plain ; \" The steady pointer leads the way, \" Stands at the scent, then springs the prey; \" The timorous birds from stubble rise, \" With pinions stretched divide the skies; \" The scattered lead pursues the sight, \" And death in thunder stops their flight; \" His spaniel of true English kind, \" With gratitude inflames his mind ; \" This servant in an honest way, \" In all his actions, copied Tray.\""], [64, "44 In the Church-yard are the tombs of Elizabeth, relict of Sir Walter Long of Whaddon in Wiltshire (daughter of John Cotes of Woodcote, Shropshire), 1688; John Truesdale, Esq., 1780; Mary his wife, 1783 ; James Hunt, Esq., 1790. In 1548 there were in this Parish 200 housling people, that is people of sufficient age to receive the sacrament of the Lord's supper. In 1800, there were 150 houses and 830 Inhabitants. In 1861, \u201e \u201e 1,567 In 1871, there were 347 habitable houses, of which 17 were empty ; and 1,579 Inhabitants, of whom 801 were male and 778 females. The earliest date of the register of Baptism and Burials is the year 1538, that of marriages 1546. The year 1603 is wanting in the Begister; in 1625 there are seventeen burials registered and in 1665 nine, both of these were plague years. The aproximate averages of registered Baptisms, Marriages, and Deaths per annum were as follows : Baptisms. Marriages.

The Act was declared to be \"for the encouragement of our woollen manufactories and the prevention of the exportation of money for the importing of Linnen.\" Of course this was very unpopular, and the higher classes usually paid the penalty. This act was repealed 54 George III, 1814. Pope, in his Epistle to Sir Bichard Temple, alluded to this Act. \u2014 \" Odious ! in Woollen ! t'would a Saint provoke !

His award is dated 24th December, 54 George III, (1813) which with the map attached is now kept in the Church chest. He first stated what roads, footpaths, and ponds were to remain public for ever. He then awarded a plot of the Common, containing 20 acres or thereabouts, as freehold to the Churchwardens and"], [71, "51 overseers in Trust for the poor for ever, in lieu of the furze and bushes they had heretofore been entitled to cut on the Common for fuel. He also set apart another piece of Common, containing 5,j acres to supply the Parish with Gravel, and another piece of 4 acres for a cricket ground and other recreations of the Parishioners, and he then awarded the rest of the land to the different Landowners. He goes on to recite, that power by the said Act is given to the Commissioner to Infranchise, if so required, any of the Messuages, Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments whatsoever, holden of the Manors of Harefield and Morehall, \"and the Commissioner shall assign, allot, and appoint for the Lord of the Manor such parts, shares, or proportions of the said Messuages, Land and Tenements so to be enfranchised and exonerated from all payments whatsoever, as in his, the Commissioner's judgment, should be a full equivalent and compensation for all fines, Heriots, Beliefs, Services, Customs, Bights, Claims, and demands whatsoever of the said Lord.\" Many of the Copyholders took advantage of this Act, and demanded that their Copyholds should be Infranchised, and amongst them were General Sir George Cooke of Harefield Park, and B. G. Spedding, Esq. of Weybeards ; accordingly eight plots of Common, previously allotted to Sir George Cooke, amounting to 19\" V 17* were awarded to the Lord of the Manor, and afterwards in the same award these eight plots were exchanged back again by the guardian of Charles Newdigate Newdegate, Esq., (a minor, aged 20, the Lord of the Manor) for a piece of old enclosed meadow containing 13\" V 35p being the north part of the Church field.

Under the provisions of the Harefield Inclosure Act and by the award 24th December, 53 George III, (1812), a piece of Land containing 10 perches (No. CXV. on the award map) lying in the Village Street of Harefield, was sold by the Commissioner for the sum of \u00a37 10s. to Mrs. Jane Parker of Harefield Lodge, Widow ; Bev. John Penrose, of Harefield aforesaid, Clerk ; Joseph Ashby Partridge, Esq., of Breakspear ; George Cooke, of Harefield Park, Major General in the Army; Bichard Aylmer Haly, Esq., of Hare field Grove, Major in the Army; Bobert George Spedding, of Hare field, Esq., their heirs and assigns, for the purpose of erecting a School and Premises thereon. In the year 1858, Mr. Newdigate, the Lord of the Manor, being desirous of improving the School, applied to the Bev. Mr. Penrose, the sole survivor of the original purchasers of the small piece of land,"], [73, "53 to co-operate with him in carrying out such a desire, which Mr. Penrose willingly consented to do, Mr. Newdegate giving another small piece of land containing about lr 2P (and marked No. CXLIII on the award map), as a playground for the said School. Mr. Penrose and Mr. Newdegate by a deed dated 13th November, 1858, respectively conveyed the two aforesaid pieces of Land to the Minister and Churchwardens of Harefield upon Trust, to permit the said premises to be used as a school for the education of the children of the labouring, manufacturing, and poorer classes of the inhabitants of the Parish of Harefield, in the Laws of God ; and in the true pro fession of the Gospel and its doctrines and duties according to the Protestant Beformed Beligion as set forth in the Creeds and Articles of the United Church of England and Ireland as now (1858) by law Established ; and in elementary or primary secular knowledge adapted to the general condition and requirements of such children. And also after school hours for the education and instruction of the Poor of the Parish by Evening Lectures. And for the purpose of a Beading Boom, or for the purpose of innocent recreation, or for any other purpose not inconsistent with the before-mentioned purposes, and being for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Parish of Harefield, and sanctioned by and under the supervision and control of the Managing Committee, and also for the Besidence of the Schoolmaster and Schoolmistress, and also for other purposes of the school, but for no other purposes whatsoever. And upon further Trust, that such School and Premises and the Funds and Endowments thereof, in respect whereof no other disposition shall be made by the Donor, shall be controlled and managed as follows, viz : \u2014 The Principal"], [74, "54 officiating Minister of the Parish shall have the direction and super intendance of the Religious and moral instruction of all the scholars, and shall have power to use the School and Premises or permit the same to be used for the purposes of a Sunday School under his exclusive control and management. But in all other respects the control and management of the School and Premises, Funds and Endowments, and the selection, appointment, and dismissal of the Schoolmaster and Mistress, and assistants (except in cases particularly mentioned in the Trust deed) shall be vested in a Committee consisting of the principal officiating Minister of the Parish, his present Curate, any such future Curate or Curates, if the Minister shall appoint him or them to be a member or members of the Committee ; the said John Penrose, and after his decease, his son Francis Cranmer Penrose, Esq., such of the Churchwardens of Harefield, such of the owners of Harefield Place, Harefield Park, Harefield Grove, and Breakspear Estates, as shall be members of the United Church of England and Ireland, and five other persons and no more, being and continuing to be, contributors annually to the amount of twenty shillings each to the Funds of the School, and being and continuing to be members of the United Church of England and Ireland as by law established, and either having a beneficial interest to the extent of a life estate at the least in real property in the said Parish, or being resident therein. Any vacancies to be filled up, as set forth in the Trust deed. A declaration that the Master, Mistress, Assistants, and Teachers must be members of the Church of England. Provided that the right of appointment and dismissal of Master, Mistress, Assistants, and Teachers is vested in Mr. Netcdigate for life, unless he shall otherwise"], [75, "55 direct, and afterwards the appointment and dismissal shall not be con- trary to the written desire of the future owners of Harefield Place. There are also directions for the settlement of any difference of opinion between the Ministers and the Committee respecting the prayers, the religious instruction, the books, or dismissal of the Master, etc., on account of unsound instruction in religion: and also in respect of other differences in the Committee of Management, or between the Committee and the owner of the Harefield Place Estate. Also a Declaration that if the Bishop or Arbitrator in the cases referred to them shall direct the dismissal of any Master, Mistress, Assistant, or Teacher, such direction shall operate as a dismissal. The School therefore is a private Denominational School, entirely supported by voluntary subscriptions and the children's pence, and these having lately fallen off, the School for the last three years has been gradually getting into debt. There are about 90 boys on the books, of whom 60 attend regularly. ,, 80 girls \u201e 55 \u201e There is also an Evening Class attended by about 15. The Funds for the support of the School average as follows Subscriptions \u00a370 0 0\"| Boys' pence 21 0 0 > \u00a3111 0 0 Girls' pence 20 0 o) Boys' pence. Girls' pence. The yearly expences of the School amounting to about \u00a3150. The Committee of the School and the majority of the subscribers, of which there were only 35 out of the 140 rate-payers, considering"], [76, "56 that the Teachers ought to be certificated, the Schoolmaster passed his examination for that purpose in December 1871; and this will in future entitle the School to some Parliamentary Grant, if found efficient by the Government Inspector at his yearly examination. The Schoolmistress is still uncerlificated. I cannot but think that in a Parish like Harefield, where the Properties are so divided, and the subscribers to the School orily amount to 35 out of the 140 rate-payers, that it would be advisable to transfer the present voluntary School to the Bating System with a School Board aud compulsory attendance, enforced under such regu lations as Parliament may see fit to adopt ; excepting that on Sundays, the School house and Premises should be reserved for the Sunday School, to be entirely under the direction and control of the Vicar of the Parish. By this plan every rate-payer would be obUged to pay towards the support of the School in proportion to his property in the Parish. In 1871, an Infant School was established, to be entirely under the superintendance and control of the Vicar of the Parish, quite distinct from the Church of England School just mentioned. A good infant School Mistress was soon obtained, who passed her examina tion for a Government certificate in December 1871. In a very short time there were about 60 children, all under seven years of age, who attended regularly. The School is at present held by permission of Miss Barnes in one of the rooms of the building erected by the late Bobert Barnes, Esq., as a memorial of his son who died while a student at Oxford in 1864. It was intended to be for a Beading Boom free for all Parishioners, and on the first floor is a very large lecture"], [77, "57 Boom. During Mr. Barnes' residence at Harefield, all the expence of this Beading and Lecture Room, about \u00a360 a year, was paid by him, this included the purchase of papers and periodicals, lighting, etc. ; but since he sold his property (Harefield Grove) and left the Parish, it has been but little used ; There is no endowment, and the Beading Boom being free, there are no funds for its support. In 1869, Mr. Barnes offered to make over this Memorial Building to Trustees for the use of the Parish, under certain conditions, whicii having been duly considered by those Trustees (proposed by Mr. Barnes) who resided in the Parish, they decided that, until they could see some way by which the expences of such a building could be met, they regretted to be obliged to decline the responsibility of the Trust. Mr. Barnes, during his few years residence at Harefield, built a very pretty chapel, which he afterwards made over to the Wesleyans. There was at that time but one Wesleyan family in the Parish. BENEFACTIONS. The Alms Houses were built by Alice, Countess of Derby, who died in 1637, and left by will a charge upon her Estate of \u00a336 a year for their support, viz. : \u00a35 a year to each of six poor women residing therein; \u00a31 a year for repairs, and \u00a35 a year for the Minister to read prayers to them. In 1622, (Lysons says,) Mrs. Ashby gave \u00a340 to the poor's stock. 8"], [78, "58 In 1664, Mrs. Mary Ashby gave \u00a3100 to the poor.
