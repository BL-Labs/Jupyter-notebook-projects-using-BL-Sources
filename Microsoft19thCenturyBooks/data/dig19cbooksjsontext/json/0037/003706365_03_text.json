I am well aware that among a certain order of novelists and novel readers, a hero is thought a very con temptible poor creature if he does not remain undeviatingly true to his first love through forty or fifty chapters of close print ; although during his journey through these chapters, he may have to encounter several fascinating and seduc tive young persons, who exert all the arts they have acquired by a long ap prenticeship to the science of love-making, to divert him from the straight path that leads him to the altar, where, robed in the shining nuptial raiment, stands the Only and the True.

I had been noAV ten days at my uncle's. He had begged me in his hearty, hospitable manner to stop the fortnight, and I had consented. There had been a time during those ten days Avhen I was eager for nothing but to return to Updown. But Conny's silence had made me rebedious. I have indicated some of the thoughts that upset me.

However, I should be untruthful to pretend that my resolution to stop a fortnight at Thistlewood was entirely owing to my desire to pique Conny.

I well remember leaning over her one day Avhen she was playing the piano, and sighing inaudibly, \" Yes ! were Conny to deceive me, here might I find her substitute.\" Did I start on becoming sensible of the escape of so disloyal a sentiment ? Not I. I never started in my life at an idea of my OAvn. Am I a Radcliffean, an Ainsworthian hero, that I skip in my cloak to an impulse, and recod with bloodshot eyes before a fancy ? It was Conny's fault. Were it the last drop in the wed \u2014 I mean, Avere this my last breath, I should say, \" Conny was to blame.\" I loved her as fondly as any man can love whose passion is fed by the beauty, but not by the promises, of the adored.

There are hundreds of verses among the poets illustrative of this, the best of which I might easily quote if I knew where to find them. Don't say this digression is neither here nor there. It is here and there too. It concerns my sincerity ; it vindicates my loyalty. Riding with Theresa on a fragrant and glowing summer evening, we fed to talking about Conny.

In vain my uncle strove to be cheerful ; in vain he told his best stories ; in vain he indulged in little flirting allusions to matrimony, and winked out, so to speak, those little modest jokes which are universally held to be permissible on the occasion of the presence of a newly married couple.

But judge my surprise, when, after an interval of not less than five minutes, I observed Mr. Curling, who had been puUing at his watchguard in a fashion that threatened to tear the waistcoat off his back, rise, and in rising knock his chair over, which however, nobody offered to pick up, that he might not be interrupted.

He next informed us that he was ne\\7er considered a good speaker, and that if he didn't express all the gratitude he felt, it was not because he didn't feel it, but because he hadn't the words.

In a loud, angry voice, she begged him to cease, burst into tears, and rushed out of the room.

There was instantly a scramble. My uncle, who thought Curling had fainted, shouted to the servants for brandy Conny, weeping bitterly, fell on her knees and picked the broken glass away from the carpet near her husband's head. Theresa turned pale, and clasped her hands ; but I, suspecting by the young fellow lying stdl that he couldn't get up, laid hold of his arm and pulled him on to his legs. Now then Conny's affection displayed itself.

To have had Conny's large, blue, surprised eyes watching me whilst I talked with her cousin, and cut my little jokes and looked happy, wyould have been more than I could bear. Next morning my uncle suggested to me that I should remain at Grove End and amuse Theresa. \" She wull be dull Avith my wife,\" said he, \" Avhose temper makes her bad com pany.\" This proposal was perfectly agree able to me, and I had the pleasure of spending a happier day than I firmly believe was ever passed even at Rosher ville.

I longed to find out whether it was amiability that kept her happy in my company, or some more complimentary, some tenderer feeling. Somehow or other, I couldn't make love to her as I had made love to Conny. Nothing had been easier than to mutter my eternal devotion into the ears of the golden-haired maid ; nothing was harder than to pay Theresa even a compliment. It was not that she Avas cold ; on the contrary, she wxas very genial.

The good lady Avas very gloomy, and quite impenetrable to the attacks of cheerfulness. When wye entered the house, we caught her helping a servant to pack a hamper, which she boldly avowed was for her daughter ; and the moment the servant left the room she exclaimed, \" My daughter shan't be starved by that man.\" Here was prejudice ! \"Starved!\" I cried; \"why, poor feUow, he worships her.\" \" And so he ought.

Nothing but time will cure this stub bornness, I thought, turning away. The young people were to be married \" properly \" on Monday morning, at nine o'clock. This early hour was fixed that the people at Updown might not get scent of the proceedings. Curling, in my presence, had protested against the ceremony, as superfluous. But my uncle was firm. \" I shall never consider my daughter your wife, sir,\" he exclaimed Avith some heat, \" untd the service as directed by the Church of England has been read j; over you."], [200, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 190 \" But we are married ! \" urged Curling. \" Thoroughly married.\" \" I say you are not ! \" shouted my uncle. \" You dare not disobey me, sir ! \" I'U do anything you want,\" replied Curling : \" but I shaU go to my grave protesting against this second ceremony.\" I looked forward to the ceremony with many misgivings, having no doubt that my aunt would misconduct herself. When Monday morning came we all rose very early, and supplied, at the break fast table, such an assemblage of dolorous faces, that more dejection could not have been expressed, had we been going to escort some favourite relation to the galloAvs. My uncle proposed that Theresa and I should walk to the church in advance of him and his wife, lest,"], [201, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 191 should Ave go in a body, the attention of the people might be drawn, and a proces sion folloAv us to the altar. \" Anything to keep this matter secret,\" said he.

Without embarrassing Curling, he contrived to make a A'ery great deal of him, engaged him in a conversation on topics on Avhich the young man Avas weU qualified to talk, and developed so many really good social points in him, that not only Avas I never more favourably impressed, but I actually caught my aunt regarding her son-in-law Avith a face absolutely pro mising with a propitiatory expression."], [228, "218 MY UNCLE'S SCHEME.

She sat next to her mother, and I assure you that I would rather have forfeited the pleasure of having Theresa by my side at the table than missed the satis- faction of seeing Conny slip her hand into her mother's, and leaAre it there to be nursed and petted.

There were not only two houses to be sought and furnished (Dick being resolved that Theresa and Conny should both begin the duties of housekeeping at the same time) but there were two trousseaux to be got ready, for as one of us very properly observed, \" It isn't because a girl makes a runaway marriage that she doesn't want the same outfit that would be given her had she been married correctly.\" A busy month that was ! Theresa Avent to Thistlewood, but returned after an absence of a fortnight ; her father declaring that no nonsensical fastidious ness should permit her to mope alone in a big house, Avhich Avould be all the more duU, not only because it Avas the home she w7as to leave for ever, but"], [234, "224 MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. because she would contrast it with the cheerfulness of the house at Grove End.

These had to be furnished ; and as my uncle Tom had no time to devote to the work, I was \" told off \" to assist uncle Dick.
