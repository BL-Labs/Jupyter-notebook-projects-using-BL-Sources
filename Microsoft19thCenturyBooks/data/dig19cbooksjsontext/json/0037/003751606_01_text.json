The strong light of an early June afternoon \u2014 or so much of it as could penetrate the soot-laden atmosphere of town \u2014 was slanting across the gardens of Ladbroke Square, perhaps the prettiest of the sort in all London. The broad gravel walks were sprinkled with pairs"], [13, "The Superior Sex. 5 and groups of grown-up people ; upon the grass were tangled knots of children, and many other groups of quick-moving tennis players ; while outside the palings, street-boys and others stood gazing in upon the miniature paradise of trees, green grass, saunterings, tennis, and romps. Along the eastern side of the gardens, two persons were slowly pacing, by turns talking desultorily and watching the restless children. ' Considering our sex, Alice,' said the taller of the two, just as they passed the gate of the square, ' we talk but little. Perhaps the presence of so many gentlemen is a wholesome restraint upon the tongue-gymnastics proper to women ?

Alice laughed, for there was peculiar absurdity in the enunciation of these violent sentiments, not by some soured old maid, but by a person such as her present companion, Alexis Trevanion, a girl of nineteen or so, possessed, as far as outward seeming went, of every thing that nature and good fortune could give her \u2014 of youth, health, wealth, and beauty ; the latter, too, of no ordinary kind, nor of the mixed description that gives loopholes to hostile criticism, but unquestionable, striking, recognised by all.

When Lexie Trevanion was present or expected in Ladbroke Gardens, you could perceive, from the aspect of a score of young men, that she was a favourite beauty, to be acquainted with whom was a virtue as friend-making and friend-finding to a man as a well-filled hamper to a schoolboy ; and whose smile, or even glance, was a thing to brag"], [18, "to The Superior Sex. of first and foremost of all the host of brag topics which young men keep always upon the premises ready to be served to all comers free of charge.

The other sex too had an openly expressed admiration for Miss Trevanion : indeed women have so long and so persistently been assailed by accusations of total inability to admire one another, that, from anxiety to expose the libel, they are somewhat apt to overdo the thing, and quite to oppress one by eager panegyrics upon their rivals."], [19, "The Superior Sex. 11 ' By-the-bye,' Alexis resumed, after walking for a short time in silence, ' I forgot to tell you that we are expecting guests to-night ; my father wires from his club \u2014 ah ! here's the telegram \u2014 laconic, you see, as becomes a man.

In the tone of this last remark there was a sudden drop from caustic artifi ciality into real sadness, in response whereto Alice pressed her friend's arm more closely.

Alexis thereupon took out a key and let her friend and herself into the little strip of territory belonging to No. 500 Kensington Park Gardens.

In short, permit me to lay down this one hard and fast axiom, that an appeal to man, to be efficient, must be gastric ; or, to throw it into syllogistic form, \u2014 ' All men are assailable through what they love.

Presently a thought seemed to strike her ; she turned quickly to a little re cess, in which a photograph of herself had hung for some months, and was confronted by the counterfeit present ment, not of her own face, but of a fox - terrier falling backwards in an at tempt to investigate the contents of a milk - can \u2014 a specimen of the simple hearted art beloved of the British public."], [33, "The Superior Sex. 25 At sight of this substitute for her self, Alexis seemed stirred by something deeper than wounded vanity ; she looked sadly round for the photograph, dis covering it after brief search, put away behind a little stack of empty cigar boxes, with its glass cracked, and the face blurred by a broad streak of dust that had worked through the breakage. It would seem that she was a more sentimental young person than might be inferred from her previous cynical observations, for, having made this dis covery, she walked to the window and stood there, looking with dimmed eyes upon the sunshine and active children, while large tears rolled unheeded down her bright young cheeks, and presently whispered to herself, \u2014 ' Oh, father, father, if you could but have loved me !

The girl was an only child, and, losing her mother before her sixth birthday, had been brought up partly by a certain good-natured, indulgent aunt, partly at a good London school, where she had won golden opinions. It was no case of loveless girlhood, pathetic isolation, or unkind repression. There was no step mother, nor even hectoring elder sister ; in short, there appeared no cause for the growth of a single weed of morbid roman ticism in Lexie's character. Thus, up to the time of leaving school \u2014 a year before the scene of the last chapter \u2014 she had much reason to be satisfied with herself, and to take an irreproachably healthy view of things. Furthermore, as if to put a culminating stroke to her happiness,"], [36, "28 The Superior Sex. her father, Major Trevanion, had just left the Lancer regiment in which he had been serving abroad, and was at that time on his way home to England, where he proposed to set up an establishment and settle down to London life, in com pany with his daughter. Let it be said at once that the Major was neither a blackleg, a sharper, nor a gentleman-burglar, nor even a bad fellow, as men of the world go. He was simply a profoundly selfish one, a man selfish even as compared with other men, \u2014 and truly to have attained to such a pinnacle of indifference to that part of the universe not contained in his own skin as this implies, speaks volumes for the Major. He was a connoisseur in selfishness, \u2014 a man who had made a life-long cult of his own wishes and"], [37, "The Superior Sex. 29 interests, one who should be looked upon with deep respect by consistent males, as a supreme master in an art earnestly practised by them all, viz., that of securing at all times, in all places and before all things, one's own comfort. Now, unfortunately, Alexis had the tendency to idealism not uncommon at her age ; her youthful dreams had, by the end of the eight years during which she was being educated at home without ever seeing her father, evolved a picture very dear to her, and definite even to the minutest curve or passage of colour. It was that of a happy home life with a father upon whom she might lavish all her heart's warmth, whom she could watch and worship, cover with endearments, and surround with nest-like feminine"], [38, "The Superior Sex. 30 comforts. And his dream ? Verily it needs but few words to disclose it, to lay bare the yearnings of this parent's heart ; and let them even be his own words, in order that we may do him amplest justice. ' Look here, Biddulph,' said the Major to his friend, one hot night in Bombay, 'I'm sick of soldiering, and think seri ously of sending in my papers, and go ing in for English life. A bachelor's establishment in town isn't bad, but I suppose I shall have to include my daughter, who, I'm told, is learned and accomplished, and that sort of thing \u2014 and, between you and me, Biddulph, it's a dam nuisance ! ' ' Hum ! ' said the other reflectively, ' the womenkind always are that ; there's the beauty of foreign service, you get clear away from all that hampering'"], [39, "The Superior Sex. 31 In fact, there was something so innately masculine in this fear of Major Trevanion's, as to draw ready sympathy from his fellow- man and fellow-soldier. That fear, care- fully analysed, would be found to mean this : \u2014 ' I've been a rich idle man all my life, and know nothing to speak of about anything outside the usual sphere of whist- table gossip. This daughter of mine ap- pears to have read books, and will pro- bably despise my ignorance. I shall have the trouble and vexation of putting her in her proper place, to begin with, and of keeping her there afterwards ; and if she goes in for being one of your superior females, this suppressing process will be a continuous bore.' Wherefrom it is apparent that the deep male vanity \u2014 which is to a woman's as a bottomless mountain lake to a rippling,"], [40, "The Superior Sex. 32 shallow, flooded meadow \u2014 had been stirred up, and that Lexie's accounts of her school triumphs had tended to increase the disturbance. Her aunt had reported to the Major that Alexis was quite a paragon among school-girls, \u2014 that her music and sing ing were much above the ordinary, and that she was considered the best lady painter of heads at the Slade School. Yet in this last respect Major Tre vanion might have drawn comfort from anyone conversant with art-school mys teries, had such a one been present. Unfortunately, there was no one to tell him that the average young lady amateur is not usually a person absolutely steeped in art-enthusiasm, but leans rather to art properties, to the \u00e6sthetic tucker,"], [41, "The Superior Sex. 33 the sprightly bib, the well-trimmed apron, and such like important items in the make-up of an art student ; that her heart is less in the painting than the picturesque environment ; that she copies at the National Gallery, in order to be looked at, and, in point of fact, does far more posing in the course of the year than an average hired model. Her real strength, the irreverent critic might proceed, lies in criticism ; any six months' art-student, fresh from charcoal and the antique, will disparage for you a Rubens or a Turner, and surely such powerful critical faculty, he might add, can only co exist with great learning : wherefrom may be deduced the sweeping yet comfortable thesis that all art-students have great learning, and that we are so happy as to possess in our midst quite an army of vol.

Much obloquy is daily cast upon professional criticism, but how about the perennial flow of amateur dis paragement ? In consequence, however, of the absence of any such comforter among his brother officers, Major Trevanion learnt to con sider his daughter in the light of an accomplished prodigy, probably highly charged with self-conceit, and more than likely to look upon himself with but a condescending respect. Meanwhile poor Lexie was preparing for the conquest of this father. She toiled at the piano and the easel many hours a"], [43, "The Superior Sex. 35 day, in order to make herself an ac complished daughter, filled up resolutely the shortcomings \u2014 neither few nor slight \u2014 of her father's letters, and conjured up pictures of him from heart instead of head, in order to become a loving one : read for him, worked for him, played for him, founded herself on an ideal model \u2014 evolved from much reading \u2014 of what men look for in their womenkind, so that she might satisfy him at all points. From the Major's letters she gathered that his tastes inclined chiefly towards horseflesh and whist, a discovery which sent her through a long and improving course of sporting novels, and thence to a careful study of the modern scientific whist methods. Moreover, in all these abstruse studies, the anxious daughter was hampered by the only trouble that"], [44, "The Superior Sex. 36 had yet fallen to her lot, i.e., a weakness of the eyes \u2014 an ailment existing chiefly, according to her friends, in the realms of fancy \u2014 that limbo to which we relegate the major portion of all bodily pains other than our own \u2014 but which was, nevertheless a considerable hindrance to her at times. At length, after self-improvings, and dawned upon which her father for the was ten years old. all these strivings, polishings, the day Alexis was to meet first time since she It was to her a day fraught with intense excitement, the dramatic culmination of prolonged hopes and anticipations.

He expected to be met at Charing Cross by his daughter, and conducted at once to the newly-prepared house \u2014 there to settle down as a respectable British father, with a daughter as yet all untried in a woman's only real business in life \u2014 viz., that of looking after man's well being and convenience. When the moment to which she had been looking forward for nine long years \u2014 to youth a whole lifetime \u2014 at length arrived, and she found herself standing upon the Charing Cross platform, await ing the Dover express which presumably contained her father, Alexis felt strangely depressed. She was certain that her costume, designed months ago, and sub mitted to many Slade student friends for approval, was, after all, not the thing ;"], [46, "38 The Superior Sex. that she would be extremely shy and awkward with her father ; that she was looking pale and pasty just when she wished to be most radiant \u2014 in short, that it would be a relief to have a good cry in a secluded corner of the second-class waiting-room, as a prelude to the coming ordeal. Yet, had she only known it, Lexie was even now making a considerable stir among the many loungers at Charing Cross. Unfortunately, however, that ubiquitous quality, vanity, has a certain cowardice of its own, and is apt to desert us at the hour of utmost need. Ordin arily she was not so superhuman as to be unaware of her attractive power over the male species, but now her perceptions of that power were quite dimmed by nerv ousness. In the waiting-room she was"], [47, "The Superior Sex. 39 quite unconscious that many persons were staring intently at her, and that, when she presently hurried out upon the plat form \u2014 being quite incapable of sitting still \u2014 that stern toiler the South-Eastern Rail way porter, whose emotion even the clink of coin moves but gently, looked back after her with interest. When the Dover train drew up, Major Trevanion, easily recognisable from his photographs, emerged to his daughter's gaze. He was a tall, handsome, self satisfied man, at the present moment somewhat out of temper from nervous ness, though a nervousness arising from a cause quite other than his daughter's \u2014 namely, from the dread of being caught round the neck, and kissed before an admiring crowd.

The drive to Kensington Park Gardens was truly an idol-breaking journey for her. At every street corner almost, some hope departed, some fresh settling down into the earth of the pedestal upon which her youth and affection had set the Major, took place. He was greatly surprised at his daughter \u2014 even astonished at her beauty, and conscious that she would be a chattel to be proud of.

On his side, Major Trevanion grew more and more pleased with this un demonstrative daughter, passing many complimentary remarks upon her in his own mind, and declaring to himself, with a glow of cheerfulness, that she was likely to be much less of a bore than he had imagined \u2014 a very graceful pane gyric, though not put into words.

All along the Bayswater Road he harped unceasingly upon the same string, so that she had the opportunity of inserting her self still further into his good graces by showing a remarkable faculty of patient listening. Just as they passed the gates which open upon the Broad Walk, the Major espied his old friend Dr Vaughan, and straightway stopped the cab, told Alexis"], [54, "The Superior Sex. 46 to drive on home, and, with many ex pressions of relief and satisfaction, walked off with the Doctor into Kensington Gardens. wondering, when she at No. 500 Kensing whether any soul in was more miserable youth has but slight Lexie drove on, presently drew up ton Park Gardens, all the great city than herself.

He never spoke a harsh word to Alexis \u2014 no shadow of a quarrel was ever between them ; in his view of things, he was himself as the sun, his daughter as a harmless mole cule upon the surface of some unnoticed satellite ; his own ego being as a mighty globe over whose rim he could not see without unpleasant straining, and a tip toe attitude, or as a vast concealing screen between himself and the unwise.

After this he would pat Lexie's cheek, remarking, in a pleasant, friendly way, as though speaking to some casual friend of the temperature, that she was looking thinner, as was true enough, for the girl was losing health daily, \u2014 and finally finish up this brief domestic in terview \u2014 the sum of his daily inter course with his daughter \u2014 with ' Hum !

It is this, that during his after-breakfast walk, he used to take his dog for exercise, not merely for the pleasure of the dog's companionship, but from pure benevolence, and a desire to keep Autolycus in good health, which makes the Major's conduct the more creditable. Other evidence too might be adduced to show that he was no mere selfish worldling ; for instance, he twice during that first summer asked, while driving down to the club, after his groom's wife ; and as he was told on the first occasion that the poor woman had just died, the second inquiry was quite superfluous, and the more philanthropic for such superfluity.

If she slides by chance into some highway of sound induction, she stumbles and staggers, whereas in her favourite lanes of argument, bristling with & priori fal lacy as they are, she skims along with the ease, the spring, the spontaneity, of a greyhound's gallop.'

' Think what a loss to the human race I should be were I to die to-night !

He had long ago diagnosed Lexie's nature, as well as her excellent father's, and, but a day since, had been discussing this neglected daughter with a certain hard - working vicar of the neighbourhood, in whose parish she had lately done much visiting.

Get her away to some employment, to some place where she can be useful, and can feel that there's some one to love her.' This was less unpalatable than that common weed good advice is wont to be, from the fact that the Vicar's views happened to coincide with his listener's ; and while pondering the same, Vaughan had in the course of the afternoon evolved an idea which he now communicated to Alexis.

He cared nothing for the Major's Indian experiences, which, had his state been sounder, would have made him laugh heartily. Mr Kennedy he looked upon as a harmless parson, who might babble of Shakspere if it amused him, but who certainly could not expect to be listened to.

This was his op portunity, and he seized it with a readi ness that might have satisfied his late commentators, cab-drivers and footmen.

There were no visible symptoms of a quarrel between father and daughter; they conversed with ease, and parted at the Major's usual hour of starting for his club. Alexis felt, as she stood upon the down platform at Waterloo, exchanging a few parting remarks with her old friend, that there was a certain whimsicality about her present situation, which rather suited with her present mood of sadness and soreness, underpropped by resolution to show nothing of her feelings to any one. There was an element of droll incongruity about this step she was tak ing, an inherent unsuitability in the role which had fallen to her lot ; for she was,"], [98, "The Superior Sex. 90 in theatrical parlance, ' going on ' as a companion\u2014 a part such as ought natur ally to be filled, as Lexie remarked silently, by an ingenue, not by a nineteen-year old cynic in petticoats like herself.

During these reflections, she was un- consciously causing a considerable com- motion in one of the third-class carriages higher up the train, in which were seated two young men, answering respectively to the names Flanagan and Trumping- ton. These well-matched young scamps were going down to Aldershot by this train, although not due in camp till next morning, because, to use their own phrase, they were ' quite cleaned out,' not having so much as a cab-fare left between them, after taking their third-class tickets.

If we hadn't been cleaned out, we might have been travelling with that beauty.' Presently Trumpington was permitted to thrust his head out, and immediately recognised Alexis \u2014 a pretty to-do ensuing upon the discovery. In a trice he was forcing his way out of the carriage, trampling impartially upon several pairs of feet in his progress, and muttering, \u2014 ' It's some one I know, Tim.

Lexie's sense of coming failure seemed to increase inversely as the square of the distance from her destination ; every yard passed over added a fresh cold note of its own to her chill conception of the coming life at Oakhurst. She had begun with such high hopes, and fallen so quickly and so hopelessly in the matter of winning her father's love, that the healthy san guineness of youth had deserted her."], [103, "The Superior Sex. 95 She was convinced that in this lesser venture failure as speedy and complete would be her fortune.

Lexie was quick to per ceive this in his voice and look, and the little cares with which he surrounded her ; she responded with the surprised gratitude of one accustomed to the highly masculine attentions \u2014 of such delicate texture as hardly to be visible to the naked eye \u2014 of Major Trevanion. The Colonel's polite anxiety seemed to her a new and pleasing phenomenon in a man, one to be observed and analysed with some interest."], [114, "106 The Superior Sex. ' I begin to see,' she reflected, as they walked towards the dogcart, ' that this manager of mine is of an unusual type. Dr Vaughan said that he was nicknamed \" Colonel Gush,\" a title as significant, I should imagine, of his fellow-man's con tempt as well could be. One can easily comprehend that my manager's earnest courtesy and benevolence are annoying to his fellows. Ah, now he addresses a porter ; will he ask after the man's wife, and the teething of the last baby ? Nothing so bad as that I see ; still he is too civil, too gushing, in short too kind, to escape the contempt of other men. Colonel Chesney ought to be a whole some check upon my hobby-horse riding, but I rather fear will tend to promote the same, by showing me what a man can be like if he wishes.'"], [115, "The Superior Sex. 107 Still commenting to herself, Lexie took her seat beside Colonel Chesney, and was soon bowling along the pleasant Surrey Lanes, trying to enjoy the country, yet still too anxious about her approaching ' rehearsal ' to do so. Colonel Chesney, watching the girl's face, and noting her ready tactful wit in responding to his remarks, was on his side also beguiled into speculative questionings. Was this girl no whit appreciated by her father ? Then truly Major Trevanion must be hard to please. ' You look sad, my dear,' he commented silently ; ' considering what a bewitching young creature you are, you should be all sparkle and hopefulness. I don't like to see a young face so clouded.'

The Colonel spared his companion all guide-book cuttings, not considering that a list of the owners of the various country seats they passed would tend to the removal of her first strangeness ; but he spoke a good deal of his daughter, explaining that he, like Lexie's father, was a widower with one child ; furthermore, that his daughter Maud was not a confirmed invalid, but only somewhat delicate, and for the present obliged to lie down entirely.

He seemed to dwell lingeringly on Maud's"], [117, "The Superior Sex. 109 name, \u2014 to quit the subject with difficulty ; and when he spoke of his great hope of seeing her quite well again in time, Lexie saw in his eyes just the look which she had hoped and longed to call into her own father's, but which had never come. One house only Colonel Chesney pointed out. ' This,' he said, as they passed a rural-looking country vicarage close to his own lodge gates, ' is Mr Kennedy's ; his wife is a cousin of mine. And both she and her daughter are often with Maud.'

I know that hard-featured invalid will receive me with patronising civility, while her friend in the background apprehends the details of my costume.

A great surprise awaited Lexie upon entering.

Moreover, in those keenly-perceptive moments of first im pression, the visitor saw something be yond mere prettiness, something not often to be found in young faces, viz., the quiet patience of one who has suf fered much without complaint ; so that Lexie's very first thought was, ' Here is one who never complains.'

The invalid laughed pleasantly as she resumed her reclining position. ' Pray don't say so, for I live in such an atmosphere of flattery already, that a single extra compliment per diem will destroy any shred of modesty I have left.

I've made a scientific study of the masculine character, look you, with the following results.' Then Lexie, once fairly launched up on her beloved topic, flowed on for some time with her usual eager elo quence, plunging, much to her listener's amusement, into all sorts of whimsical ex travagance. In fact, Maud enjoyed the jest ing and nonsense so heartily, that Lexie was tempted on and on, until tears of"], [124, "The Superior Sex. 116 laughter ran down the invalid's cheeks as she cried, \u2014 ' Poor fellows, poor fellows ! I wish some of our Aldershot friends were here to listen to you.' ' Tush ! tush ! A man never listens, he talks; that is, until his ideas run dry, which is usually pretty soon, and then, instead of listening to your modest remarks, he is thinking what to say next.

And Maud her self, with her eyes upon her father's face, her mind feeling with his, her thoughts drifting with his thoughts, re counted to him Lexie's peculiar philo sophy, and made merry about all and sundry things that occurred to her.

Yet, though Alexis was not sufficiently a part of his life to leave a serious blank behind her on departure, her father was this evening in an unsatis factory mood, made up of mixed feel ings, and having in it veins of self analysis and self-doubt.

He had been used to see the British soldier upon field-days in the Long Valley, resplendent in pipeclay, with that painful defect, his extreme youth, concealed by a coating of belts, greatcoats, and whatsoever else is em braced by the expression ' marching order.'

Oh, strange, passing strange, that this great Anglo-Celtic nation, upon whose possessions the sun never sets, should elect to send forth to battle only the babe and the suckling ! Once well into the heart of the South Camp, however, Tom English's reflec tions became purely personal. He was joining his regiment, approaching a situa tion in the little drama of his life having features peculiar to itself, and well cal culated to try the nerves of a sensitive lad. Nor had Tom's bringing-up been quite a fit prelude to the career he was now looking forward to with so much enthusiasm, though he imagined in his"], [139, "The Superior Sex. 131 youth and innocence that he had seen something of life during his year at Sandhurst. Perhaps there is no other phrase so encrusted with fallacy as this popular one of ' seeing life.' A youngster goes to college, as he thinks, to see life \u2014 that is, to mix with others of the same way of thinking as himself, \u2014 in short, to live in his own set, with men of tastes and pre judices like his own ; whereby he sees not life, but just the one facet of its many thousands that reflects his own person ality. But let him join the mess of a regiment or a man-of-war ; let him be thrust into daily, hourly, contact with men, of whom some, at least, must be distasteful to him, \u2014 compelled, perhaps, to smile at what offends him, to listen to what he loathes, and he actually does"], [140, "The Superior Sex. 132 see something of that weird variety-en tertainment \u2014 human life. We have gathered from Lord Henry himself what sort of a man was wanted in his regiment, and what sort of character had preceded English from Sandhurst ; but had the Royal Aldershot known more of the boy's bringing-up, they might have shaken their heads indeed. For Tom's youth had been spent at simple little Scandalbridge. He had lived with a fond mother, going to the big public school daily, but boarding at home ; and beyond this, his education had been en tirely neglected. He had never been into a stable ; he knew not billiards ; nor had his character been braced by a proper course of ' nap,' or ' poker.'

Let the record stand thus in its naked and terrible simplicity ; the most smiting comment thereupon would be merest anti-climax. At first sight of the busbied sentry of his new regiment, Tom's heart beat high. ' Ours,' he whispered softly \u2014 ' ours.' As he spoke, the cab drew up in front of the anteroom in ' Z ' lines, and the first mess call rang out from six bugles, as if to give him an imposing welcome. Once in his quarters, he dressed with nervous speed, and presently found him self lingering in the passage, preparatorily to opening the anteroom door. His"], [142, "The Superior Sex. 134 hand shook as he turned the handle : he would like to have tried his new life, as a timid bather the temperature of the water, with one foot first. But the laughter and chatter inside betokened a room-full, so it was a case of plunge or nothing. Upon entering the red-jacketed assembly, Tom's first glance fell upon some one he knew, and his spirits rose considerably, to fall again very speedily. For this happened to be the great Captain Rossiter, the show man of the regiment, whom Tom had once come across in a country-house near Scandalbridge. The great man was at the moment leaning against the mantelpiece, dispensing to a large circle of admirers some quiet re marks concerning the in-and-out running of a certain horse last steeple-chasing season."], [143, "The Superior Sex. 135 Tom, catching his eye, smiled cordially, the simple lad; and, advancing a step or two, awaited Rossiter's greeting, which, when it came, was a neat, epitomised commentary upon the world's ways.

The Captain, putting up his eyeglass, and interrupting his discourse but for a brief moment, said, \u2014 Ah! fancy I've met you somewhere \u2014 Switzerland was it ? Just joined, I suppose ?

As it was, they had already heard that he was not of the right sort, and the reception now accorded him might have come out of an ice-pail, insomuch that Tom was thankful to back into a corner and take up a book. Even here fresh discomfort awaited him ; the volume he took up was the regimental whist-book, and appeared to contain every name in the mess. ' One will have to play whist, then,' thought Tom. He felt sick and un hinged : he and his mother had agreed, in their pastoral simplicity, that he was to have no regular allowance, but to write home when in need of money. It was Tom's earnest desire to spare Mrs English, who could ill afford to let"], [145, "The Superior Sex. 137 him follow his fancy and become a soldier, all possible expense ; and this whist-book suggested a whole vista of spending. While he was thus reflecting, Lord Henry and Tim Flannigan entered the room amid the cheerful greetings of all present. The former, after explaining that he had come down from town too thoroughly cleaned out even to afford a cab from the station, said, \u2014 ' By-the-bye, has English joined yet ? I've heard on good authority to-day that he's a dev'lish good fellow.' Then, perceiving the newcomer in the corner, he advanced towards Tom with out the least embarrassment, and shook him warmly by the hand, Tim following suit with equal friendliness. English was amazed, for the teaching of experience is quick as well as sure,"], [146, "The Superior Sex. 138 and even in those few moments he had become aware that men of the world do not fatigue themselves by construct ing cordial welcomes to strangers. Not having the key to the situation, he could not guess that the finger of Miss Tre vanion was the magic wand which pro duced this strange cordiality. After three minutes' conversation with English, Henry whispered to his chum, \u2014 'He's a deuced good-looking fellow, Tim, but mighty innocent, I fear ; any how, I shall do my best for him, for I've promised to. choke off O'Hara, I We shall have to expect.'

The maligned sex, too, may thus be judged under most favourable circumstances, for who shall say that we have not here a most re spectable sample thereof?

Let us, after this brief prologue, begin our impartial investigation by listening to the discourse of the two loudest talkers, Captains Chute and Browne.

To reflect upon such a man, his stern justice, his disinterested devo tion, is to have some glimmering of those fine qualities which make the superior sex what it is.

Once more, ' No.' Poor Tom felt chilled as the various strata of his incapacity were thus laid bare by the probing Major. ' Now what possessed the boy,' thought Auchinlech, ' to be gazetted to us ?

The reasons adduced for this isolated superiority have been many, in some cases too, highly ingenious. Schopenhauer, for instance, suggests that men are only jealous in their own guild, and of fellow-craftsmen ; whereas women, belonging all to one guild, and having a one common object, to wit, that of pleasing the men, are universally"], [178, "The Superior Sex. 170 jealous, every one of every other. This may be so, yet one could suggest another good working hypothesis for the solution of this problem, viz., that jealousy, at least the true plant, has a close kinship with love, whereby men are seldom over burdened. Woman, loving many, has a wide field for the development of this passion ; man, loving, as a rule, but one, and that one himself, has no chance of generating jealousy ; though of the minor hybrid forms, the commoner weeds, so to say, which have their roots in ruffled vanity, the male of our species is not surpassable as a producer.

She had nursed Maud as a baby, yearned over her as a toddling motherless child, sickened to watch her blooming girlhood fade into ill- health ; loving her always with all the strength and wealth of a deep nature ; surrounding her with such infinite cun- ning of watchfulness, such lynx-eyed, soft- fingered care and devotion, as only a woman can practise, but which a man may perchance condescend to appreciate when he is ill himself.

Old Mary had a homely face full of intelligence, red-brown wavy hair streaked with grey, a rare smile, and a rarer laugh, which, when uttered, smote the air in a cheerful, healthy cackle, and needed a thrown back head and plenty of space to get itself properly bodied forth. It was a sad blow to this nurse-mother to be told that her precious patient was to have a lady companion.

Yet by the time Miss Trevanion arrived, Mary had so far mastered herself as to treat the visitor with distant politeness, though Lexie felt the hostility of her every look and gesture, and knew that it would be hard enough to overcome. On the morning after the respective entries, each upon a new stage, of Alexis at Oakhurst and Tom English at Aider shot, Maud Chesney and her satellites were formed in a group outside the open windows of her boudoir. The Colonel was reading the paper, his eyes turning ever and anon to his daughter's face ; Lexie was making a sketch of Maud's head ; Mary hovering about upon any slight pretext that served to keep her near the invalid."], [182, "The Superior Sex. 174 As they sat thus enjoying the sun shine, a servant announced that Mrs and Miss Kennedy had come over from the Vicarage. This news had a ruffling effect upon the group. 'Say I'm busy, Maud.' Before the words were well out of his mouth, Colonel Chesney had disappeared into the house. Maud laughed, saying, \u2014 ' Lexie, they've come to inspect you.' ' Very good ; I have as little fear of my own sex as respect for the other.' Old Mary's sentiments were easily dis cernible. She bridled at the very sound of the name Kennedy, and disappeared after the Colonel, covering her retreat by a volley of muttered disparagement. Mrs and Miss Kennedy then came out of the drawing-room window, and were quickly immersed in the important"], [183, "The Superior Sex. 175 business of small-talk with Maud and her companion. Alexis found herself entertaining Mrs Kennedy with a feeling of respect, un dermined by growing dislike. This was a well - bred woman, and obviously a sensible one. Her remarks were always judicious, never clever. She had the air of one confident in the power of earning the world's respect, and caring nothing for its love. Her re lations with all the neighbouring powers, she might have said, as Queen of the little parish of Oakhurst, were excellent ; even so, for she never omitted a social duty nor said a foolish thing. Yet her own subjects hated her with surprising depth and fervour ; some poor people going so far as to say they would rather get kicks from other people than money"], [184, "176 The Superior Sex. from Mrs Kennedy.

Colonel Chesney declared of this cousin of his, though never to anyone but him self, that her only strong emotion was one of contempt for her husband. Miss Kennedy, on the other hand, seemed the complement of her mother ; she had plenty of strong feeling, and a tongue that was badly in want of a stopper.

She was now prepared to dis like Alexis from pure jealousy, while Mrs Kennedy had another and sounder reason for wishing to oust this new comer, viz., the advisability of keeping Maud, the heiress of Colonel Chesney, well under her own influence. A woman of strong character like herself, having a hold over a gentle-natured girl with a large command of money, might, as she put it during frequent self-commun ings, be the means of doing a great deal of good in the world.

Alexis followed, and was in splendid voice. Miss Kennedy felt crushed: her chagrin was palpable ; her admiration of Lexie's performance too highly coloured for nature. But the sting of her encomium lay ready in its tail. ' A rich, sympathetic, striking voice,' she said to Maud, ' and obviously well trained, but a little flat. What a pity it is that so many fine voices are not quite true.' Much is contained in that slim little word ' flat.' It is minute, but deadly \u2014 a whole volume of disparagement in four letters, and a good safe one to put forth among people having only an average ear for music."], [187, "The Superior Sex. 179 Stung by her defeat, as she called it, Miss Kennedy then began to patronise Alexis, speaking as a Vicar's daughter to a hired governess. This put Lexie on her mettle. She responded with extreme civility, speak ing as a London-bred girl, who had seen society, to a simple, rustic maiden, who had not. By judicious questions and observations, she proceeded to sound the depths of Miss Kennedy's ignorance, and to expose them as thoroughly as the patient Major Auchinlech had laid bare Tom English's the night before. o o It appeared that Miss Kennedy loved pictures, \u2014 of course she never missed an Academy ? On the contrary, she had seen but one, and that five years since. Which were her favourite artists ? She enumerated one or two popular"], [188, "The Superior Sex. 180 Academicians defiantly ; but when gently pressed to discuss them, could not com pass more than a brace of tolerable platitudes about either. She had also been to the National Gallery \u2014 once; but could only name one Turner out of the whole glorious array, and was not aware that the gallery contained a Rubens or a Rembrandt. All this was very painful, for Miss Kennedy was wont to lay down the law on matters artistic to a whole circle of friends. Her mother listened, shivering, but clinging gallantly to her small-talk with Maud. At length the visitors rose to depart, taking leave of Miss Trevanion with many civilly - expressed wishes to see more of her, etc., etc., and a feeling that they hated her more in a short time than any one they had ever met."], [189, "The Superior Sex. 181 Maud looked nervously at her friend when the others had disappeared, and Lexie answered the glance as though a spoken rebuke. ' I couldn't help it, Maud. I'm not malignant, as a rule, but the one thing I cannot and will not endure, is patronage. I could easily have pleased them by a little cringing ; it is so easy to impress favourably those whom one cares nothing for. Alas ! it is only the desire to please that makes pleasing hard ; the stronger the wish, the more absolute the failure.

'It is our \"At Home\" this afternoon, Lexie, and I expect a lot of visitors. People are so kind in coming to see me now that I'm an invalid : I really believe one hardly appreciates the world's kind ness until one is ill.' ' And yet,' Alexis added grimly, \u2014 \" How sick we need be e'er we make men just.\"' ' Many gentlemen come over from the camp. There's Lord Henry Trumping ton now, and Mr Flannigan ; a kinder pair never breathed.' Lexie pricked up her ears, but said nothing. ' Lord Henry is so boyish, and droll, too. He and Mr Flannigan insist upon being my horses for the afternoon ; they harness them selves to this couch, and draw me about,"], [191, "The Superior Sex. 183 which makes me rather nervous, though I couldn't hurt their feelings by crying out. Last Thursday I could hardly per suade Lord Henry to take any rest ; he was drawing me about the whole after noon. He's as kind and gentle as a woman. However, Lexie, I'm boring you with this discussion of strangers, \u2014 worse still, by committing the heinous offence of praising one of the obnoxious sex.' ' Don't mention it,' Lexie answered. ' I don't grudge them an occasional crumb of encomium, however undeserved. Tell me more of these strangers.' Maud told her a good deal more of Lord Henry ; indeed, Alexis appeared singularly tolerant of the subject, and encouraged her friend to wring it quite dry before proceeding to another. Of"], [192, "The Superior Sex. 184 Flannigan, and Rossiter, and others of the Royal Aldershot mess, Maud also spoke. She had a humorous way of describing people, and a kindly habit of dealing gently with all. ' I think, Maud,' said the new friend contemplatively, as they went indoors for lunch, ' you have taught me a great deal in a short time. How much \u2014 how very much \u2014 would I give for one tithe of your charity ! Truly it is a sweet quality, of which I scarcely possess one grain.

In point of fact Lord Henry was about this time actually starting for Oakhurst. He had asked English to go too, remarking that he could easily get him a mount, and Tom had an swered with promptitude, ' Certainly ' \u2014 as he would have done with equal readi ness to the question, ' Will you come and play target for the men to practise at with ball cartridge ?

Accordingly Hal had despatched a note to one out of his host of camp friends, and at one - thirty a spirited young mare belonging to one Rowels, of the Lancer regiment, down in the cavalry barracks, was being led up and down, together with his own hack. ' A very spicy little mare, English,' he said, looking approvingly forth from the door of his quarters, as Tom mounted. ' Very much so,' the latter answered ; adding to himself, ' spicy enough for me anyhow. I wonder how much of me the beast will carry safe to Oakhurst ?

' If I can but get safely out of sight of the lines without disgracing myself, I don't so much care,' he muttered. At first his steed appeared to be in a contemplative mood, and Tom found him self upon the heather, safe beyond the precincts of camp, listening, as well as excitement permitted, to Henry's cheerful gossip. But now the mare snuffed the pleasant breeze, squealed, and threw up her heels playfully, discovering at the same moment the surprising fact that she was carrying a mere duffer \u2014 a raw beginner. She was"], [196, "The Superior Sex. 188 accustomed to the tight grip of Rowels, who had spent some three-quarters of his waking life in the saddle ; what could this stranger rider be \u2014 a creature whose legs scarcely seemed to press the leathers against her sides ? He might be only absent-minded, a dreamer : she would try him further. Another caper, and lo ! the duffer was upon the heather, unhurt, but crimson with blushes. ' Hullo ! ' cried Henry ; ' I didn't know you were such a Johnny- Raw in the saddle, young shaver ? ' ' Ah ! you'll soon know all my vices, the list is swelling hourly. I'm no rider, \u2014 never had a chance of being one \u2014 you see \u2014 ' . . .

' I"], [197, "The Superior Sex. 189 shall not do you much credit in any way, I fear,' he concluded, rather miserably. ' Gammon ! ' retorted Henry kindly ; ' you're too modest by half.' Not long after this they rode under one of the South-Eastern Railway bridges, and, as ill-luck would have it, a train came rattling up at the moment. Tom's mare was not likely to throw away such a chance : in a moment she was bounding down the road to Ash Village like a rocket, throwing herself violently from side to side. Tom having got down into his seat a little by now, stuck to her man fully for a few seconds : nor did he suc cumb this time until tired out. He tried to throw his weight back and bring a give-and-take strain upon the mare's head : the sweat poured down his face as he set his teeth and hardened his heart."], [198, "The Superior Sex. 190 But fatigue conquered him, and his legs lost their grip : though spirit held, muscle gave ; and when, just short of Ash Village, the mare swerved suddenly to the right, he found himself, in the twinkling of an eye, shooting through the air. The ground leapt up to meet him : a thousand stars danced before his eyes, then were quenched in darkness. Two gentlemen advanced from a gate upon which they had been sitting and picked him up, quite insensible ; they were Rossiter and O'Hara, out here in the country upon no good errand, as we may be sure. After a few seconds Tom opened his eyes and was much discomfited at seeing them : he said nothing, but a burning flush spread over his white face as he rose slowly with their assistance ; so keenly did the"], [199, "The Superior Sex. 191 sense of shame assail him, that for the mo ment he wished he had broken his neck. As he arose, Lord Henry rode up. ' By George, I feared you'd come a cropper ! Anything broken, old chap ? You mustn't think of mounting again \u2014 the mare's too much for you.' Tom looked doggedly down the road, and saw a yokel in leather leggings lead ing the mare. He was badly shaken, bruised, dazed, and wearied, but his spirit was unquenched. ' I shall mount again at once,' he said curtly. He then shook the dust from his clothes, fumbled in his pocket for a six pence for the yokel, and climbed into the saddle, while the man held the mare's head. ' Upon my soul ! ' cried Henry, as they rode off, ' you've got pluck enough anyhow,"], [200, "The Superior Sex. 192 and that's more than half the battle in riding, but I wish you'd give up this.' ' I sha'n't : I shall stick to it.' O'Hara and Rossiter stood looking after them ; the former was inclined to praise English's pluck, but feared to do so. ' I say, though, Rossiter,' he began, ' there's a doggedness about that boy, eh ? ' \" What the deuce does he mean by joining us?' the other retorted bitingly. ' Perhaps he has got pluck, but a crack regiment is not an academy for the instruction of raw boys ; he ought to have been out to nurse before coming here.'

We need be very sick to make men just, according to Lexie's quotation \u2014 ay, and how much more than sick to make them kind ! The two subalterns rode on through shady Surrey lanes ; through quiet villages ringed with lush meadows and flower spangled copses ; across quaint little com mons sprinkled with waddling geese and toddling children. Tom's mare having quieted down after her escapade at Ash, he felt comfortable enough to enjoy keenly the change from pipeclay to rusticity. It was pleasant indeed to listen to piping bird-notes in place of the probing questions of Auchin lech, to meet the kindly glance of nature instead of the scathing gaze of Rossiter. vol. 1. n"], [202, "The Superior Sex. 194 As for Henry, he was somewhat troubled with a headache, consequent upon last night's revelry, and found the suave peacefulness of the country very soothing ; he felt a little penitent, too, for breaking up Tom's bicycle, and found himself pleading guilty to an imaginary arraignment by Alexis. He remembered how once, before he knew her well, he had vouchsafed Miss Trevanion a spirited description \u2014 such as other ladies had often encouraged him to give \u2014 of a certain ' big night ' at the mess, and what a severe lecture she had read him on the spot, ridiculing what he considered humour, and calling fast gentlemen by hard names. ' Yes,' thought he, ' her talk is like a tonic, strengthening, but precious bitter ; and there's a big dose in store for me when I come to confess \u2014 as I always do somehow.'"], [203, "CHAPTER X. EFORE Tom and his companion had emerged from the net work of lanes between Aider- shot and Oakhurst, Maud and her father were entertaining a considerable number of visitors. On these occasions Maud used to hold her court upon the lawn close to the tennis-courts, so that she could lie in the shade and watch the players ; and the Kennedys always came to assist her. Kate Kennedy was present this after-"], [204, "The Superior Sex. 196 noon as usual, and watched with ever- growing vexation the sensation made by Miss Trevanion. All the men seemed drawn towards the girl by some irresisti- ble power, coming in twos and threes for introduction to this new beauty, and lingering about her neighbourhood until Lexie had quite an elbowing crowd of satellites around her. There was the well-known artist, Mr Wintour, who only last week had taken such marked interest in Miss Kennedy's society, now immov ably fixed at Lexie's left hand, after gravitating towards her from the first moment of setting foot upon the lawn. It might seem natural that, as an artist, Wintour should cling to the neigh bourhood of so fine a piece of colour as Miss Trevanion ; but, in point of fact, he was not an artist proper \u2014 only a painter."], [205, "The Superior Sex. 197 Otherwise, he might have escaped dis tinction ; might have wasted his life in the solution of subtle colour-problems, in straining to pour forth his art-conscious ness upon canvas \u2014 or some such folly proper to genius and idealism. Fortun ately he had no art-consciousness to pour forth, and no colour faculty to speak of, but only a happy knack of supplying the public with much insipid prettiness \u2014 and they loved him well. Wintour was wise enough to have but one subject, and that a slight one ; thus he could be recognised, understood, eulogised, before people had worked along the first wall of the first room at the Royal Academy. Yet he con scientiously rang the changes on this subject of his, which was a milkmaid in cool grey against the warm green of"], [206, "198 The Superior Sex. an English meadow. The girl, it is true, was always in the right foreground, balanced by a group of cows in the left middle distance \u2014 a most natural group too, as everybody said with perfect truth, for every animal had fronted WTintour's camera, and he was an excellent photo grapher. But it must in justice be added that the milkmaid sometimes carried a can, sometimes did not ; that the sun light did not always slant from right to left, but sometimes conversely ; that the state of the vegetation in his picture sometimes proclaimed the period to be the last week in May, but almost as often the first week in June. Moreover, there were other more subtle variations with which the patient reader need not be troubled. Once he painted a Thames backwater, but five other well-known"], [207, "The Superior Sex. 199 artists had limned the same spot that summer, and the picture never sold.

In common with a large majority of his sex, he was apt to conceive of the female mind as a sort of shop-front, specially adapted for the display of his own mental wares \u2014 an empty space wherein to heap those glittering stuffs in the full gaze of every passer-by.

Then, after noticing this favourable beginning of acquaintanceship with pleasure, Henry turned to take stock of the bystanders, and straightway found himself staring amazedly at the clean cut profile of Miss Trevanion, who was at the moment engaged in leading poor Wintour into a labyrinth of paradox, wherein his eloquence wandered and was quickly lost. 'Jove!' muttered Henry, too breathless for more words, then beamed with satis faction in such wise that Alexis, watching him out of the corner of her eye, could scarcely forbear laughter.

He happened to be a clever man who talked well, so well that Henry soon found himself out in the cold, listening gloomily to an animated discussion between the two, wherefrom his ignorance might have derived much o o instruction, had his temper permitted ; but he objected to these clever people with whom Lexie always got on so well, and presently cast about for some means of extricating her from the surrounding crowd of admirers. ' I think,' he remarked, at the first convenient pause, ' that Miss Chesney is looking tired ; suppose we draw her down to the river, out of the throng for a time.'

Alexis found that the air of this idyllic eventide was somehow getting into her head. She seemed unable to dominate Lord Henry as she was in the habit of doing, but even sat down upon the bank at his request, and, throwing off her hat among the flowers, watched the slow glittering ripples, the skimming swallows, and the landscape throbbing through the yellow sunlight. Henry was watching her face instead of that of nature, but wisely forebore to be sentimental ; he spoke of his father, a topic most sympathetic to Alexis, for he was heartily fond of the Duke, as she could tell from the tone of his voice the very first time he mentioned ' the"], [219, "The Superior Sex. 211 old governor.' He talked penitently of the trouble he had often caused this kindest of parents, how he was con stantly in debt, and how kindly his father had always dealt with him ; in short, Henry was in very humble mood this evening. When he had rambled on for some time, she began abruptly, : \u2014 ' It was kind of you to think of Maud's fatigue, and \u2014 ' ' Stop a moment,' he said. ' I don't deserve even that praise ; it was pure self-interest. I wanted to get you away from the curate. It's hard lines,' he added, plucking fretfully at the grass, ' to have to confess it, \u2014 to reject the only word of praise you ever threw me.' ' Let me throw you another for your honesty : I doubt if many would have made the confession.'"], [220, "The Superior Sex. 212 ' There's a worse to come, and I don't deserve your praise, by Jove ! \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 last night I smashed up English's bicycle. I'm afraid I was rather \u2014 ' ' I understand,' Lexie answered quietly ; ' I understand perfectly. It is not my place to judge you ; but \u2014 but,' she added sadly, ' you have spoilt the beauty of the evening and the flowers and everything \u2014 let us go back to the others.' Meanwhile Tom also had been mak ing confessions, \u2014 telling his invalid com panion, much to his own comfort, and not a little to his own surprise, of his utter failure last night, and of his dis grace at Ash village an hour or two since. In point of fact, Maud Chesney was a born recipient of confidences : all her little world of friends poured their troubles into her lap, as a matter of"], [221, "The Superior Sex. 213 course. She was one of those who, having no gift of smart uncharity or prickly criti cism, and no ready dogmatism upon ordin ary topics, is generally summed up by that profound critic, the world, in this wise, \u2014 ' Very sweet and gentle, and all that sort of thing, but there's nothing in her.' This vacuum or emptiness of character, however, the same critic kindly endea vours to fill up by the grievance-pouring process aforesaid. Tom, as it happened, was grateful and appreciative, feeling much relieved by his confession, \u2014 ' Why should calamity be full of words ? Though what they do impact help nothing else, Yet do they ease the heart.' Presently Colonel Chesney, who could seldom endure to have his daughter long out of his sight, joined them, and vindi"], [222, "The Superior Sex. 214 cated his right to the nickname bestowed by his friends, by insisting that Tom and his friend should stay and dine at Oak hurst, instead of hurrying back to camp. Tom was overjoyed at the thought of escaping Auchinlech and the others for a whole evening, and as he turned to accept the invitation with alacrity, the other two rejoined the group. Lord Henry endeavoured to acquiesce in the acceptance with cordiality tempered by seemliness, albeit much minded, as he whispered to Alexis, to throw his hat into the air and cheer Colonel ' Gush.' ' And look you, Miss Trevanion,' he re marked aside, ' this is all the more accept able in that it saves me from a ducking.' Shortly afterwards, when Mrs Kennedy and her daughter were taking their leave, the Colonel informed them, in his cheer-"], [223, "The Superior Sex. 215 ful, benevolent manner, that ' both boys ' were going to spend the evening at Oak- hurst \u2014 an announcement that gave an added bitterness to Miss Kennedy's in- vective during her walk across the park. This was, of course, Miss Trevanion's doing ; she had committed many crimes and misdemeanours this afternoon, where- of the most conspicuous was the de- liberate beguilement of half-a-dozen gentlemen, including the clever curate, and Lord Henry Trumpington, both of whom had betrayed a partiality for Miss Kennedy's own society on the last At Home day at Oakhurst. Moreover, it was clear that Maud Chesney was quite bewitched by this conceited, sar- castic, self-confident companion of hers ; a state of things upon which Miss Kennedy waxed very eloquent to her mother."], [224, "The Superior Sex. 216 Now Mrs Kennedy was not the sort of person to waste breath in making spiteful remarks such as her daughter indulged in, but just as they passed through the lodge-gates, she summed up the situation with admirable brevity, in a calm, emotionless tone \u2014 yet one which silenced her daughter's wordy vexation in a moment, by these simple words5 * That girl must go.' Had Dr Vaughan, or some such phil osopher of the cynic school, overheard this conversation, he might have remarked, ' What a pity that so much good spite and jealousy should be wasted!' But he would probably never have prophesied the curious issue of the same, the unexpected conjuncture to which Miss Kennedy's rather natural emotion was to lead."], [225, "CHAPTER XI. EXIE'S first day at Oakhurst was a fair type of the twenty or thirty that succeeded it. All those about her, with the exception of old Mary, were kindness itself, Colonel Chesney bestowing upon her a warmth of friendship which served as a peg for Miss Kennedy to hang much comforting and bitter satire upon, yet which made Lexie very sorrowful at times. She had taken no special pains to win the Colonel's heart, yet he was like a thoughtful parent to her. She had spent years in the study"], [226, "218 The Superior Sex. of how to please her real father, and many months in anxious endeavour to make that study bear fruit, and he had been to her, at least as far as outward demonstration went, little more than a casual stranger. She dutifully wrote to him once a week from Oakhurst, and twice received hurried notes in reply \u2014 one to say that there was no news, the other to mention in off-hand fashion that he would be yachting about the Solent and Channel during most of the summer, and hoped she would be comfortable at Oakhurst meanwhile. From Maud's affection, however, Alexis drew unalloyed satisfaction ; and from studying the invalid's unwearying forti tude, from listening to the voiceless sermon of patiently-borne trouble, she probably learnt even more than she was at the time aware of. Moreover,"], [227, "The Superior Sex. 219 another reason for gratified acquiescence in her present surroundings offered its self, viz., a pretty constant flow of masculine admiration. Lord Henry rode over about four times a week, some times upon pretexts so bodiless and slender that he was ashamed to clothe such airy nothings in words, and used to begin, ' Ah, how-d'ye-do, Colonel Chesney ? English and I have just \u2014 er \u2014 \u25a0 in fact, just ridden over from camp \u2014 just to \u2014 er \u2014 How are you, Miss Chesney \u2014 pretty well to-day, I hope ?

I'm not surprised at it, for I'm an ignorant fool beside her, worse luck. She'll never love where she doesn't re- spect, and what the deuce is there to respect about me ? ' ' To tell the truth,' Tom answered, ' I don't quite understand Miss Tre vanion ; there's something odd about her, as though she were dreading something, suffering something which is hidden from us lookers-on. She does not seem well : do you think she is suffering any pain ? ' ' I hope and trust not,' said Henry earnestly ; ' once or twice I have fancied so myself, and I can't tell you how it cuts me to think that this may be case.' Now it happened that Colonel Chesney and his daughter had also noticed with"], [229, "The Superior Sex. 221 concern a growing languor and depres sion of spirits on the part of Alexis, but could elicit no sort of explanation from her, until one night in the first week of July, when circumstances gave them the key to the mystery. On the afternoon of that day, old Mary had been more than usually jealous and bitter about Miss Trevanion, so much so, indeed, as to make her young mistress puzzled and unhappy. There are a hun dred ways in which one woman can make things unpleasant for another, and Mary, it must be confessed, had omitted but few of these lately. At first she had striven against her own jealousy with a vigour and resolution about which there was something almost pathetic, forcing her self to treat this interloper with proper civility, and sometimes even to perform"], [230, "The Superior Sex. 222 for her the little nothings that evince goodwill. But, during the last few days, the iron appeared to have entered poor Mary's soul in such fashion as to force the spite and acidity to the surface. Alexis had borne this with a patience by no means native to one of her spirit and temper, and would have continued so to do a good deal longer for her friend's sake ; but on this particular day, Maud had come to the desperate con clusion that she must read old Mary a severe lecture, though it required an hour or more's wrestling to work herself up to this pitch of resolution. All the afternoon her friend was sitting by her couch, so that Maud had no op portunity of performing this dreaded piece of duty ; about six o'clock, however, Colonel Chesney came out into the"], [231, "The Superior Sex. 223 verandah and carried off Alexis for a stroll. Maud felt that now there was no escap ing her task ; she rejected all the shrewd arguments for procrastination suggested by her fears, and rang the hand-bell that was always answered by her nurse. Old Mary was scarcely ever, night or day, out of hearing of the gentle tinkle of this bell, and now appeared immediately. On her face was the look of irritation that had lately become habitual to it, until her glance swept round the verandah, and she perceived that Maud was alone ; then she beamed all over, exclaiming, \u2014 ' What, missy dear, all alone ! Maud slid her hand nervously up and down the woodwork of her couch, feeling that her task was much harder than she had imagined, that she must really put off"], [232, "The Superior Sex. 224 this lecture until such time as Mary should be a little out of temper, or at any rate less tender and caressing than she was now. Yet then it would be hanging over her, and Maud thought she would rather face the thing itself than its continued anticipation. ' Mary,' she began desperately, ' I want to \u2014 to say something to you \u2014 to \u2014 ' Old Mary's face changed with almost dramatic suddenness ; for conscience makes us perceptive as well as cowardly. ' Oh, nurse, nurse ! it makes me so depressed and tired, when you \u2014 you know \u2014 ' It was abundantly evident that Mary did know, for her face grew all puckered and quivering, and she began to sob hysterically. ' It makes me very unhappy, Mary, that"], [233, "The Superior Sex. 225 she ' \u2014 no need to mention names, as Maud well knew \u2014 ' should not be treated pro perly ; and she does so much for me . . . And pray don't cry so, old Mary, or I shall too.' The speaker need not have used the future tense ; her cheeks were growing moist even in this initial stage of the business. ' And do try hard to like her better, nurse ; she hasn't too much affection. I fear that her father cares very little for her, and I believe she suffers a good deal from her eyes now, especially of a night, though she never will admit this. I think she lives in great dread of their getting worse, and is afraid that a doctor's verdict would endorse that dread, for when I speak of getting Dr Vaughan down from town, she always puts me off.

She is altogether in wretched spirits now, and I do want to comfort her \u2014 and, Mary, you are sometimes downright ru \u2014 rude to her, and it makes me so m \u2014 miserable to com- plain of you, after all you've done for me.' This speech Maud blurted out with great difficulty, then fell to crying, in lieu of finishing the lecture. Old Mary too was speechless with con flicting emotion \u2014 with anger at Alexis, distress for her young mistress, and, to do her justice, with strong self-upbraiding. But jealousy was still uppermost, and had taken too strong a hold to let her make any promises of amendment yet, or even a verbal admission of wrong-doing. She only kissed Maud's hand, shedding many tears over it, then retired to her bedroom to shed many more tears, and spend an"], [235, "The Superior Sex. 227 hour or two in comfortable solitary wretchedness. But Maud knew her old nurse with a thoroughness engendered by love, and felt certain that the difficult lecture would not have been in vain. Alexis and the Colonel presently re turned from their walk, and an evening of music followed in due course, the only break in the usual routine occurring just before Lexie left the piano ; when, after going through all the invalid's favourite songs, she lingered a little, as if loth to leave the instrument, then fell to singing the hymn, ' Thy Will be Done,' with such solemnity and pathos that Maud was glad there was no light in the room, and Colonel Chesney had to clear his throat before thanking the singer, afterwards going out into the open air to smoke a cigar, and to"], [236, "228 The Superior Sex. think of his daughter, with Lexie's rich tones as a backing to his thoughts. When they had all retired that night, old Mary might have been seen stealing down the passage to Miss Trevanion's room. She was looking pale, and was much less trim in her dress than usual. Upon her face was a look which Maud, had she been present, instead of sound asleep in her room, dreaming that she was well again, and was galloping along the Hogsback by her father's side, with a strong west wind blowing the roses back to her cheeks, would have interpreted at once as one of resolution to face an unpleasant duty. Mary had a feeling somewhat akin to defiance as she knocked at Lexie's door. She was going to say something civil to the interloper, to hint, perhaps, were she well received \u2014 and she appreciated Alexis"], [237, "The Superior Sex. 229 sufficiently to know that this would certainly be the case \u2014 at something like regret for late o o petty rudenesses ; but she was going to be neither very humble nor very gushing. Hearing a murmur of some sort in answer to her knock, Mary opened the door, and straightway her carefully - ad justed conception of the coming interview was shocked into nothingness. A picture met her gaze which filled her with anxious pity, and with surprise so great that she stood stock still, without uttering a word. Miss Trevanion was kneeling by the open window, with the faint mellow light of the summer night falling upon her dis hevelled hair. Her face was buried in her hands, but as the old nurse entered, she raised it, and Mary saw that her features were convulsed with pain. When she spoke, there was an anguish in the"], [238, "The Superior Sex. 230 young voice which touched old Mary to the quick. ' Come in, Mary ; I shall be glad to talk to you. I could not conceal it much longer. I'm suffering an agony of pain, but even that is nothing, nothing to the mental dread \u2014 ' ' Why, child, what ails you ? ' said old Mary, laying her hand as tenderly upon Lexie's head as though it were her own invalid's. ' Don't take on so. Dear heart, what is it ? Oh ! I've been a brute to you, but you'll forgive me \u2014 ' ' The pain, Mary, the pain ; it grows worse : I can hardly bear it ! ' ' I've been a brute, I say,' sobbed Mary.

'"], [240, "CHAPTER XII has been related in a former chapter how Tom English had been unfortunate enough to disgrace himself by a very poor display of horsemanship before just those two particular members of the mess for whose absence at the time he would have been most thankful, viz., Rossiter and O'Hara. Now it happened, by some ironical by stroke of fickled Fortune, that on the afternoon of the day after Maud's difficult lecture to her nurse, Tom was called upon to fill a different role, having the"], [241, "The Superior Sex. 233 identical brace of brother officers as spec tators. The incident came about in a rather sudden, unforeseen fashion, though more or less in the ordinary course of things. It has been said that Tom was a girlish, sensitive fellow, and perhaps his general lack of the true grit that belongs to manly selfishness was nowhere more conspicuous than in the matter of his letters to his mother. The lad was now thoroughly permeated with the consciousness of his own failure as a British subaltern, and growing steadily more miserable as the weeks went by and he found himself slipping further and further out into the cold. Not that any active hostility was manifested towards him : in the con sulship of Auchinlech furniture-breaking, and such florid methods of making things"], [242, "The Superior Sex. 234 rough for unsatisfactory youths had never obtained ; but English found himself ig nored, isolated, apart. Unless Flannigan or Trumpington happened to be present, Tom always sat silent in remote corners of the anteroom ; his poverty kept him aloof from the general life of the regiment, his pride added to and exaggerated his keen sense of being unpopular : he was an interloper among the herd, a stranger within the gates of a happy family which didn't want him. It was no easy matter to keep this state of things from his mother ; indeed, had he but known it, such concealment was im possible, and he might as well have given his mind \u2014 if the success obtained thereby be the index of an effort's worth \u2014 to trying to square the circle. Nor was he of an age to get much satisfaction from"], [243, "The Superior Sex. 235 the mere effort's self, \u2014 to appreciate the poet's maxim : \u2014 ' The aim, if reached or not, makes great the life.' He was but a kind-hearted lad en- deavouring to bear his troubles alone. To which end he expended much laboured ingenuity on his letters home ; chose brief interludes of non-depression for writing, dipped his pen in continual cheerfulness, and only spoke regretfully of the money he was forced to spend, declaring that for the rest the regiment was quite a home to him. Meanwhile Mrs English treasured up every line her boy wrote, knew even better than himself the veins of feeling he strove to conceal, and would have loved him the more for his striving were it pos- sible for such mother-love as hers to have a ' more.'"], [244, "The Superior Sex. 236 On the afternoon in question Tom had wrenched from himself one of these cheer ful letters, and the birth pangs of it proving more severe than usual, he started to taste of the best solace permitted by circumstances \u2014 that is to say, a country walk. Lord Henry, who would ordinarily have been his companion, was on guard, so Tom set off alone, choosing as his goal a certain sequestered village lying knee deep in meadows a little off the road to Oakhurst. Among numerous less pleasant dis coveries concerning himself, Tom had lately found that he possessed that com forting faculty \u2014 Imagination. During his happy schoolboy life at Scandalbridge, he had failed to appreciate the fact, imagina tion perhaps needing for its proper de velopment the stimulus of roughness or"], [245, "The Superior Sex. 237 misfortune, as its first cousin, Invention, needs that of necessity. As he now plunged into the lanes, he made, by the aid of this happiest of faculties, a clean sweep of his whole Aldershot environ ment ; camp and barrack-rooms were no more ; the cards and billiards, that he could neither afford nor refuse, were no more ; the sneers of O'Hara, the critical glance of Auchinlech, the blank indiffer ence of his other brother officers, had all ceased to exist. Tom was once again a jovial schoolboy at old Scandalbridge, coming in from boating on the old familiar river, from a long afternoon of scrambling and pushing up side-streams with his old school chum ; anon the pair reached the boat-house, where other chums were standing about in flannels, getting into canoes, getting out of sculling-boats,"], [246, "238 The Superior Sex. greasing the slides of four-oars, and the like. Presently the pair march up the little High Street together, arm in arm, stop ping now and then to exchange chaff with other friends, until they reach Tom's home. As they unlatch the garden gate, his mother smiles a welcome from the open window ; behind her the summer breeze is wafting white curtains to and fro, and between them is a gleam of dainty china upon snow-white cloth. The dappled shadow of the old ash falls across the little lawn and upon the group of boy and girl friends who are running to greet Tom ; they shout a welcome to him as he advances, for everyone likes him, and is glad to see him at Scandalbridge . . . when, lo ! he is dragged suddenly from the very heart of this homesick reverie"], [247, "The Superior Sex. 239 and dalliance with old times by a shout of dismay from several boyish throats. Upon awakening, he was surprised to find himself close to the outskirts of a certain straggling little hamlet called Damshott, a favourite half-way halting place between the camp and Oakhurst. Past a small inn and among the few cottages of the hamlet ran a deep alder fringed stream, upon which, about fifty yards below the point he had reached, stood Damshott Mill. In this stream, especially at a big bend on Tom's left, where it ran over the tail of a shelving bank, the small boys from the neighbour ing cottages were wont to disport them selves as often as their mothers' backs were turned. Some of them were bathing now, and from them had come the shouts that startled Tom from his brown study."], [248, "The Superior Sex. 240 ' You young idiots,' he now called out, ' don't you see that if the current took you off your legs you'd be under that big wheel in two minutes, and ground to powder on the instant ?

The boys were bathing in this admittedly dangerous spot out of pure bravado, under the stimulating leadership of one Jimmy Groat, as reckless a lad as ever made a mother's life a burden to her. Jimmy had been even more venturesome than usual this afternoon, and, not content with making half a dozen other youngsters risk"], [249, "The Superior Sex. 241 drowning with him, he must needs prove his superiority to them all by adventuring furthest into the treacherous sweep of the stream. Wading out some three or four yards beyond them, he was taunting the others with their cowardice, when he lost his balance, floundered, and in flounder ing got further out from the bank, and seemed on the point of being carried off his legs into the deep water in mid stream. Poor Jimmy tried hard to turn and re trace his steps. The water was up to his shoulders : he swayed heavily. If he lifted a foot from the ground, he felt he would be swept away. The boy's white face was drawn with terror now ; his piteous eyes stared eagerly at Tom, who was advancing cautiously to his rescue. ' Keep steady,' growled Tom ; ' don't vol. 1. Q"], [250, "The Superior Sex. 242 move hand or foot : I shall get hold of you directly.' At this moment Tom heard the rattle of a dogcart on the road, and the voice of Rossiter calling to him to know what was the matter. Jimmy, too much frightened to attend to friendly injunctions, took a step to wards the bank, swayed, clutched at the air with both hands, and in a moment was swept off his legs into the full force of the current. Then he uttered shriek upon shriek as the banks began to move steadily past him. Being a good swim mer, he easily kept himself afloat, but wrestled and strove in vain to free him- self from that strong gripping tide, while the increasing thunder of the great wheel made the blood curdle in his veins. O'Hara, who had jumped down from"], [251, "The Superior Sex. 243 the trap, was now standing upon the bank, looking down with blanched face upon what was happening. His nerve was gone : he could only stare stupidly at Jimmy's struggles. Rossiter was also looking on from a point some thirty yards back. ' Nothing can be done,' he muttered ; ' before I can reach the bank, the boy will be under the great wheel.' Tom English, seeing that the lad was fast in the grasp of the main stream, that no stretching out from the banks lower down would avail to reach him, strode through the shoal water, and struck out after Jimmy, snatched at him from behind, and gripped him by the collar. The boy tried to turn and throw his arms round his rescuer, but Tom held him like a vice. The two were borne steadily onwards to-"], [252, "The Superior Sex. 244 wards the little brick bridge, under the arch of which they could now see the great wheel smiting the gliding water into foam. Tom's only hope clung to the slender branches of an alder which stooped low enough to touch the water near the left bank just above the bridge. Towards this he struggled with every muscle in his body. Jimmy, making a last effort for life, endeavoured to second his ex ertions. The broad dripping floats of the mill wheel, one after another descending, seemed almost over their heads now ; the din of it was thundering in their ears. A slight flaw of current drifted them towards the alder, another swept them from it. In two seconds they would be under the bridge \u2014 the bystanders turned aside so as not to see the end. Tom clutched frantically at the wet"], [253, "The Superior Sex. 245 alder twigs as he swept past ; they gave at first, but checked him slightly. One final effort \u2014 he knew that his strength would avail but for this one \u2014 and he touched a root : his fingers closed round it : the root held. Jimmy was swept round him by the disappointed stream, but his left hand still held Jimmy's collar as in a vice; in a moment friendly arms were reached down to them, and they were dragged safely forth on to the green sward. Still dazed with the shock of this narrow escape, Tom found himself \u2014 he knew not how \u2014 seated in the miller's parlour, with a vague buzz of talk going on around him. But after a stiff glass of brandy and water, the world began to assume its normal reality, and he was glad to escape from its congratulations to the miller's best"], [254, "The Superior Sex. 246 bedroom, there to remain until his clothes should be dry, and he should be fit to walk back to Aldershot. When he commenced that walk in the cool of the evening, Tom felt happier than he had done for many weeks. Uppermost was nature's strong reaction after escape from imminent peril, and beneath it the consciousness that he had played the man, \u2014 had come through a sharp trial with honour. He was even more shy than usual of entering the anteroom that evening. At the mill, the folks had made his face flame with their cordial praises, and though he wished for and expected nothing like this from his brother officers, he did look for ward with keen pleasure to a word or two of congratulation upon his narrow escape. He had not been a credit to his regiment"], [255, "The Superior Sex. 247 as yet, but in all things was a raw un fledged beginner, as he had felt keenly every hour of every day since joining ; now at last, however, though he was not of a sort to overrate his action, he had done something to show that he was no mere milksop. But Tom knew not the world, nor the might of human self-love and vanity. Rossiter and O'Hara had played the part of supers in that little drama at Damshott : men so largely endowed with the aforesaid qualities as they do not wax eloquent concerning situations in which they fail to score. ' Whoso is out of hope to attain another's virtue, will seek to come at even hand by depressing another's fortune,' says cunning Verulam. O'Hara, it is true, the better-hearted man of the two, was minded to do some-"], [256, "The Superior Sex. 248 thing like justice to Tom's exploit, but Rossiter pooh-poohed him altogether. The mess gathered from their account a sort of general impression that English had jumped foolishly into some small stream or ditch after an urchin who fancied him- self drowning, and that the affair was nothing to make a fuss about. Thus, when Tom entered the ante room, he was greeted with chaff, not con gratulation. ' Been trying to drown yourself, English ? Better try the canal next time you want to bathe, you'll find it cleaner than the country ditches,' \u2014 and so on in the same strain. Tom sat down with a forced laugh, and a sense of swallowing a very bitter pill. This experience went further towards turning the lad's youthful enthusiasm to"], [257, "The Superior Sex. 249 gall than anything that had yet befallen him. Hitherto he had considered his various disabilities as a sufficient justi fication of his want of popularity, but now he felt the utter hopelessness of trying to please. As he sauntered back to his quarters after dinner, he congratulated himself upon having written to his mother by the after noon post, for he felt that he would now be too miserable to impose upon her for several days to come. ' I'm thoroughly awake at last,' Tom reflected, as he threw himself wearily into his one arm-chair ; ' that's the word for it \u2014 awake. I know what life is, and of what texture is the world's justice \u2014 kindness it has none.
