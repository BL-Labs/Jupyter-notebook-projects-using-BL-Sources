Mv dear Ladt Duff Gordon, In dedicating this work to you, I take the opportunity of saying a few words as to its object. I have always thought \u2014 in common, pro bably, with most other people \u2014 that the real govern ment of the world depends much more, than we are at first sight inclined to admit, upon certain indirect influences, at the head of which I place the influence exercised by women, as being, perhaps, the most indirect, and certainly the most important. People seem to agree \u2014 as unanimously as is usual on any subject \u2014 that we are approaching a very eventful epoch. At a time, when we are drawing up in battle array to meet, we hardly know what enemy, the efficiency of every part of our social army is a matter of consequence ; and every man who is furbishing up the armour of our combatants, and striving to render it more complete \u2014 though he but sew on a buckle \u2014 is, so far, helping to do good ser vice. In this book I have been rubbing at a tiny spot of rust which I seem to see on the bright breast plate of womanly attributes \u2014 a little speck which diminishes that influence the sex ought to exercise, and on the due exercise of which so much depends. For"], [12, "II PREFACE: upon the women of to-day depends in a thousand ways the character of that next generation, on which, for anything we can tell, the world's history is about to be pivoted. As to the tone of the writing \u2014 the unexpected degree of success of my former work has in- duced me to continue in the same style. \u2014 Some have taken the liberty to assert of the majority of lady readers, that if, in turning over the pages of a novel, they find themselves suddenly in presence of three lines of \" dry \" common-sense, they are at once at the end of their wits and of their patience. I stoutly declare, of my own knowledge, that this is a libel \u2014 I am convinced that with half a fair chance the \u2014 so called \u2014 weaker sex would prove their heads to be at least as good as our own ; and I have great pleasure in dedicating this bock to a lady who has afforded so excellent an argument in favour of this view, by overstepping with such complete success those narrow intellectual limits which a bad custom \u2014 doubtlessly originating with us men \u2014 has prescribed to her sex. Of you then, my dear Lady Dutf Gordon, and of my fair unknown friends, into whose hands this book may fall, I ask permission to subscribe my self \u2014 not merely as a matter of form, but really and truly, Your ever faithful Servant, THE AUTHOR."], [13, "VALETTA CHAPTER I. To lay our failings upon others is as natural as to fail. There is a back upon which all men have chosen to lay their misfortunes, much in the same way as a certain creed of philosophy placed the whole world on the back of a tortoise \u2014 Fortunately this back is a broad and strong one. It is that of Dame Fortune. If that much abused lady were guilty of one twentieth part of the evil doings laid to her charge, so malignant a being would, VOL. I. B"], [14, "2 VALETTA. long ere this, have brought the world to a stand still. But this is our way ; Le bien nous le faisons, le mal c'est la Fortune ; On a toujours raison, le destin toujours tort. However we soon begin to conform our selves to the opinion which is entertained of us, and it is not to be wondered at if, occasionally, this mythic lady should be teased into supplying her abusers with some grounds for their complaints. To the inhabitants of a certain borough town named Benchurch, She had acted in this way and had given them most sub stantial and especial cause to add their voices to the grand chorus of reproach. Benchurch professes itself a place of high antiquity, in proof of which it can adduce, in evidence, a Norman Church, a Saxon rampart, and the ruin of an old Roman castle, all more or less apocryphal and more or less fondly relied in by its inhabitants. Like a hardy child it had survived the rough doings of those early epochs, and"], [15, "3 VALETTA. favoured by its situation, had continued to flourish on, until in the days of the Tudor kings it was a place of no little consider ation. At this latter period the sea rolled on to within a mile of its fortified walls, and a broad and deep river bore vessels of the largest burden then used up to the very margin of its busy wharves. It had, on certain great occasions, fitted out and given harbour to whole armaments, while at all seasons innumerable trading vessels were passing between it and the remotest ports of the trading globe. It may be easily imagined that under such a state of things it had its politics, its liberties, its immunities, charters, burgesses, royal progresses, and all the rest of those good things which the aforesaid lady For tune so freely bestows on those who can wrest them from her hands. It was at this period, when the good burghers of Benchurch were working as none others could work, building ships, and B 2"], [16, "4 VALETTA. fighting ships, as none others could build or fight them ; while they were getting to gether crown pieces at a highly satisfactory rate, and occasionally pausing to allow themselves the relaxation of breaking a few heads in favour of King, Church and Con stitution, or against them, as the humour seized them \u2014 it was at this moment Avhen they were full of their merits and their good luck that the tables were suddenly turned upon them : \" Pauvre gens ! que vous sert votre merite. La Fortune a-telle desyeux. ' The goddess, like some others of her sex, tired of granting favours and of hearing herself alternately lauded and abused for her complaisance, set to work to play her favorites such a trick, that, from that day to tbis they have had reason to be amoig the most virulent of her discarded suitors. The sea deserted them ! Commissioners were sent down to report on the matter ; philosophers Avere called in"], [17, "5 VALETTA. to account for it ; engineers to remedy it. There were works and plans, a solemn mass ; humiliations ; a very picturesque procession through the streets, with lights and banners, but all in vain. The sea was inexorable, and grumbled away in the distance like a surly husband in spite of the reasonings and concessions \u2014 in spite even of the tears and conciliatory new ribbons of his spouse. The bride of the sea, then, was deserted, aud worst of all, her faithless lord had borne away with him her dowry and parapherna lia. The sea was gone, that source of all her wealth and power. The high road of the ocean passed through another gate, and the town fell rapidly to decay \u2014 as rapidly as only tbe very prosperous can fall. Since then inexorable centuries have roiled away. If, at the present day, acci dent or idle curiosity or an invitation from a maiden aunt, (for business can hardly be the motive,) should lead any one to Ben church, he will find it an old, red brick"], [18, "6 VALETTA. town, with a quaint and somowhat out landish air. As he passes through its silent streets his attention will be drawn away from the occupation of listening to his own footsteps to wonder at the quaint old gables and intricate chimneys, .vhich twist themselves upwards in every grotesque variety of form. Presently he will find himself watching the little dark stream which steals along under the walls of the houses, tracing the damp mildew which creeps up the walls, and wondering to what extent the people within are embarrassed in their affairs, or how many years the old ladies Avho must inhabit all those rooms with the drawn blinds and the cats in the window-sill, have been bed-ridden. At length, with a sense of relief like a man who has emerged from a well, he finds himself at the outskirts of the town, and he strolls along a high terraced walk which makes its entire circuit."], [19, "7 VALETTA. As he wanders on, he Avill come every now and then to the ruined fragments of embrasures and flanking towers, whose recesses in old days were the terror of the enemy, and are now furnished with rough benches, whose carved and hacked seats bespeak them the chosen haunt of all the humble lovers of the district. From the top of these ramparts on one side, is obtained a view of the old dingy roofs of the town, among which rise the massive towers of its ancient churches ; on the other side, one may look down into the deep sloping recesses of what was once the moat, long since dried up, and grass grown ; but from the bottom of which still springs a teeming crop of sedgy weeds. Beyond this, lies the open country. It is a low, flat plain Avhich the plough has wooed in vain. Dyked and ditched with the most persevering assiduity \u2014 it affords a brown rank grass, on which meagre herds, and a few wandering colts manage to pick"], [20, "8 VALETTA. up a scanty livelihood. In addition to this, it yields to the town, in sole compen sation for the waters of which it once formed the bed, some indifferent salt pans, and an abundant annual supply of rhu matic fever, and ague. Through the centre of this plain, wanders the ghost of the old river \u2014 a turbid, muddy stream, dozing between soft crumbling banks. Its repose is seldom disturbed, except by some one of the lumbering barges, which, at long intervals, still find their way up to the old wharf, bearing a chance freight of coals, or straw. On the other side of this salt marsh, at the distance of four miles from the town, the sea breaks as gently and peaceably on the new margin, Avhich it has made for itself, as if it had committed no treason to its poor fading favourite, whose roofs rise in the distance. As to the inhabitants of this doomed locality. \u2014 The good folks of Benchurch have, like most other people, their pecu-"], [21, "VALETTA. 9 Rarities, and like most other people, they derive them, in a great measure, from the character of the place which they inhabit. Like all other idlers, they are an un commonly busy set. A casual passenger through the town, as he passes along its melancholy streets, would scarcely credit that within those gloomy walls there rings au incessant clamour of controversy \u2014 reli gious, political, and social \u2014 and that the breasts of the few sleepy passengers, who turn to gaze listlessly after him until he is lost at the distant corner, are full of deep and eager ponderings on the affairs of their neighbours, and the early editions of yes terday's newspapers. Nevertheless, such is the case. The clergy of the three fine old churches, profess the three most irreconcilable theories of established truth, and each with a shrug fervently trusts that his brethien may one day be found to have walked in straight paths. The congrega tions have naturally taken up the cudgels,"], [22, "10 VALETTA. and brandish them with a most hearty zeal at high, low, and via media tea drinking, In the meantime, there is equal activity in political affairs. The town council has thwarted the mayor, the mayor has retorted upon the council, until things have arrived at such a pass, that they can only be brought to act harmoniously together, when the object is to oppose themselves to the recorder, or peremptorily to demand an explanation of a vote given by their burgesses in parlia ment. Then the civil and ecclesiastic authorities, in addition to their internal contentions, have to offer a legitimate aud constitutional opposition to each others' aggressions on civil and religious liberty, which ranges through the various phases of discord, from a printed correspondence between the town clerk and the rector, down to a bout at fistycuffs between the beadle and the bailiff. Nature abhors a vacuum, and by such"], [23, "VALETTA. 11 means, these good people, rendering obedience to the universal law, rescue themselves from stagnation, and fill up those intervals which necessarily elapse between the septennial market days, on which they may look forward to dispose of the votes which now form the staple com modity of the place. One bee hive is very much like another, and so we find that these little societies, in decayed country towns, resemble each other closely. There is every where a reduplication of professions, and in each there is the man who has the cake, and the man who looks on with watering mouth to see him eat it, to hate him and pick up the crumbs. There is the banker who has retired be cause he could not keep in the field, and there is the banker who flourishes and Avho lives on his Avife's settlement and the profits of his farm. There is the old-established doctor who has all the business, and there is the newly-"], [24, "12 VALETTA. established doctor, with glasses and scientific views, who has the dispensary and a con viction that his rival knows nothing. Then there is the lawyer Avho does for the county families, and the lawyer Avho does for the prisoners at the sessions ; there is the baker who gets up a cake lottery at Christmas, and the second baker who fails in the attempt, and so on down to the very dogs in the street, one of which gets the bone while the other runs yelping at his heels. Among all these strugglers there is but one \" who brooks no rival near his throne/ It is that mighty entity \" the great man.' There is so much littleness in all of us that there is sure to be a great man every Avhere. We respectfully approach Joseph Hardy man, Esquire, who occupied this position at Benchurch. He owed his ascendancy in about equal degrees to his family, his fortune, and his character. Doctor Bolfey, antiquarian aud ex-mayor, traced back the pedigree to a"], [25, "A7ALETTA. 13 niece of Hod or Hodman, Prince Bishop of Brix, in Armorica, arriving at this ancient lady through a list of intervening Hardy mans as lengthy and uneventful as the dynasties of Chin, Tchin, Han, Tang, and Sing, in Chinese history. His less erudite townsmen .vere led to admit the correctness of his research partly by their respect for their neighbour, partly by the recollection of the many in scriptions carved on pumps and alms-houses, and painted in church aisles, all tending to shoAv that the Hardymans of Norley Court had from time immemorial been among the most munificent patrons of the borough. Squire Hardyman had neither a quick combining intellect, a strong memory, nor an intuitive judgment. He was entirely without taste, and almost entirely Avithout any opinionative creed whatever, because almost entirely without the passions, pre dilections, and illusions, in which such creeds for' the most part originate. He may be said to have had almost only"], [26, "14 VALETTA. one quality ; \u2014 this, however, was a great one. He had a will \u2014 a will of iron \u2014 of iron tempered by the tears and suffering of those who stood between it and its accom plishment \u2014 an inexorable, fatal will. The moment this slow, common-place man had taken his resolution he became in spired ; there was no more doubting and weighing of probabilities, no more anxieties, no more compunction. On he went, his will, that immutable law, was before him ; he questioned not. he knew no compunction, no hope, no fear. There was the thing to be fulfilled, and had the gallows' cart itself stood in his path he would have walked over its side into eternity without the slightest hesitation; justified to himself by considering it as a necessary, though disagreeable incident, in the working out of his plan, and having for his chief regret, in dying, that there was one thing which he had de termined on and failed to perform. In this he resembled those pigmy tribes of insects which in countless multitudes"], [27, "VALETTA. 15 pursue their way onwards in one straight, undeviating line, swerving not an inch to the right or to the left, immolating them selves by myriads in woods, houses, rivers, or any other destructive obstacle which ill fate may place in their stubborn track ; and, like them, he never failed to arrive at the goal which he had proposed to himself. At thirty years of age he had mounted the throne of all the Hardymans. The anti-room or heir-apparent portion of his life, which preceded this event, had been passed by him broiling away on the Coast of South America as an officer in the royal navy. The pay of a midshipman is not high, but those who had the management of the young Joe's finances considered that it was quite sufficient for him, and he was pinched in accordingly. There are few processes more delicate than that of \" keeping a young man close.\" Out of a hundred cases you may succeed in making forty-nine spendthrifts, and fifty"], [28, "16 VALETTA. niggards. The remaining one, good luck or temperament may preserve from the in jurious effects of your discipline. A little incident, Avhich occurred to the youth during his period of service, had a great effect on his character. In the States of South America, as else- Avhere, there have not unfrequently occurred trifling social aud political bouleversemeuts. In such convulsions here, as elsewhere, there have usually been two grand objects Avith the successful party, the first to de clare its defeated rivals hors la loi, and all their belongings confiscated ; the second to hurry this decision into execution before its own turn to run away shall have ar rived. On these occasions the hunted party would put off in boats at night to the English cruiser, or accost the young officers when they came on shore, eager to exchange those daugerous possessions their pearls, diamonds, and gold washing basins for a few spare dollars."], [29, "17 VALETTA. Alas ! for the young Joe, he had no dollars to spare. Half a century afterwards he was un able to recur to this passage in his early life without attendrissement. \" I was kep wery close \u2014 too close a'most,\" he would say. Now not many ideas succeeded in pene trating into Joe's iron skull, but when at the age of thirty he, in consequence of the death of his predecessor, entered upon the possession of Norley Court and the family estate, one at length found its way in, and remained clinched in with a firmness, proportionate to the difficulty with which it had effected its entry. Very fortunately for the happiness of mankind, the great majority of us never think at all. Ideas are dangerous things, and there are but few who can be trusted with them. They are especially dangerous to men of the young squire's temperament, for with him a thought Avas not speculative but the preliminary of an act."], [30, "18 VALETTA. This idea then of his, which was to have so much influence on his career, was, taking into consideration the circumstances under which it originated, somewhat a remarkable one. When he came to talk over matters with the executors, and to receive their con gratulations, and those of his lawyer, on the condition in which the property was handed over to him ; when he came to read over the inventories of the rich old family plate, wines, table linen, &c. ; when the junior partner from the County Bank had done himself the honour to wait upon him, and call his attention to the most interesting manuscript that ever was penned in a clerkly hand, and bound in sheep-skin, and in which Joseph Hardyman, Esquire, was described as in account with the Ben church Borough and Provincial Bank ; when he had rummaged through the house, and trotted over his acres, and formed an adequate idea of all his excellent belongings, this said above mentioned idea found its way into his head."], [31, "19 VALETTA. It was not that he would take the hounds and become known along the county side for hospitality ; not that he would get him self made chairman of the sessions, and an enlightened legislator; neither was it even that he would add a new wing to Norley Court, preserve strictly, and cultivate pines. No ! the idea was simply this \u2014 that he would \" try and get together a little bit o' money.\" This then was the notable scheme which had found its way into the squire's head ; and it was the remembrance of those fine bargains in America which had helped to place it there. If you know a soldier or a sailor, or any other person who happens to have, at any time, suffered from the extreme of thirst, you are sure to find him ever afterwards keenly sensible of the value of water, and half afraid to wash himself. The squire knew what it was to want dollars. They had intended to give him careful habits. There was no occasion."], [32, "20 VALETTA. He was of a careful nature ; all his family Avere. They had, however, been so success ful in developing this tendency in him, that tbe \"almighty dollar\" was ever present to his mind. Oh ! if we knew the might of these little things to the young. The force of these silent, inferential teachings, the homily of a happy home, the noble sentiments which lie at the bottom of a judiciously lined purse, how much misery should we spare to ourselves, our offspring and the world ! But no ! we study not this true teaching. We bit the mouth with verbal morality, and at the same time apply the spur to the passions. They begin in this way : They let the youth go on until he is sixteen. They have taught him the grammars and mythology. They have had him drilled by a retired sergeant of the Guards. He is a forward lad : he can write in the Iambic measure, and give the dates of the Greek Avars readily. Is it to stop there? by no means; they are conscientious parents, and feel that they"], [33, "VALETTA. 21 have not yet done their duty by him. They think it is time to begin the really solid portion of his education. Time to begin ! My dear sir, his educa tion is at an end. He has educated him self, as every human being ever has and ever will, because it is ordained that he ever must, and that by a law more rigid even than that which regulates the cadences of your Iambics. He has educated himself by your example ; by every blow and harsh word ; by every smile and kind word which have fallen to his share; by every thing which he has seen with those eager eyes ; by every word Avhich has passed into his thirsting ears; by his friends; his servants; by every living thing ; by every unliving thing; by the glorious sunlight; by the night; by the seasons ; but above all by that little world of home with which you have sur rounded him. This is the education Avhich it has been your dangerous prerogative\u2014 your tremendous responsibility to purvey for him ; and if you"], [34, "22 VALETTA. would do your duty by him, it is with these books that you must labour, and must labour early. Now it is too late. His education has now passed beyond your controul. Put Cicero, on the duties of life, into the fire or into his hands if you will \u2014 encourage him to take up Aristotle and split virtue into spellicans. It can do him no harm, and Avill enable him to theorise. But for him self and his bent, it is already settled with out you. Think of this ; and, if you have other sons, remember that, \" Certain age accompli Le vase est imbibe, 1 etoffe a pris son pli. Well, then, the young squire (for we must no longer keep our great man wait ing) had turned this thought over in his mind until he had got firmly hold of it, or rather until it had got firmly hold of him. That hold it kept for fifty years, and"], [35, "23 VALETTA. was the principle on which all his actions depended. He took to tilling his land in sober earn est. He was early afield, early to market. He inquired, he observed, he even read \u2014 and he did it all in so practical a manner, and with so direct an aim at his great end, that, before long, his turnips waxed rounder and whiter, and more saccharine, than those of other men ; unprecedented quarters of corn grew to his acres \u2014 the weight of his beasts became notorious ; and, naturally enough, his own weight increased in a cor responding ratio. On he plodded, planting, pruning, graft ing, clearing, felling, fallowing, manuring, sowing, reaping; but still, summer and Avinter, seed time and harvest, there was the one idea ever in his head; and the one sturdy, steadfast purpose resulting from it, still influencing all his actions \u2014 the dogged determination to \" get together a bit of monev.\" On he went then. There was, perhaps,"], [36, "24 VALETTA. some sunny nook abutting on the outskirt of his estate \u2014 the '\u25a0' angulus ille Proximus * * * qui nunc denormat agellum.\" Squire Hardyman would potter about that corner and look at it ; and, as he did so, he would draw his hand gently over his mouth, to conceal a smile at his neighbour's mode of cultivation, and then he would sit doAvn and make his calculations, with a morsel of chalk on a gate post ; and, when he, at last, wiped it all off again, he would say to himself \u2014 \" That field shall be mine.\" And so surely as he said so, so surely he kept his word. He Avould wait and watch a month, a year, five years, ten years \u2014 but, at last, he had the field. The fickle man cannot Avait. His purpose leads a sickly life, and dies a sudden and early death ; but the squire"], [37, "25 VALETTA. was a good bider. He knew that the lapse of ten years would find him in the same frame of mind ; and, therefore, he was in no hurry to conclude his bargains. He bided his time. He would depreciate the intended pur chase for a couple of years, then he would make his offer, and chaffer, and cheapen for half a dozen more. He would wait till a man was disgusted with bad seasons \u2014 tired with his importunities \u2014 in short, until the weak moment came, and then he would pounce upon what he wanted and retire into himself again until such time as his brains had formed a new conception, and selected a new victim to offer on the altar of his purpose, and then the labour and the watching commenced over again. It may be imagined that, in this little, remote, sea-side place, this man, with his quiet, encroaching character, was as irresis tible as the sea itself. And, it is no matter of special wonder that, at the end of half a century of action, he had brought himself vol. I. c"], [38, "26 VALETTA. to be considered as the \" first man in those parts;\" and as one who had discovered the celebrated lost treatise of Zosimus, the Tanapolite, on the \" sacred and divine art of making gold and silver.\" All his doings were marked, and men can vassed them to find out rules for their own guidance. If he bought, the market rose. If he sold, folks shook their heads and prognos ticated a fall. If a man said it would rain, he was told that Squire Hardyman had cut his grass. If he thought the season would be late, he was answered with a shake of the head, that the squire's corn was housed. The very elements seemed to have con spired, for the first time, to favour an agri culturist ; and the frosts and droughts of the last twenty-five years, had not deprived him of so much as a cabbage. Had such a man prophecied a deluge, people would have got their things together and built an ark. Had he even prophecied"], [39, "27 VALETTA. the last day, they would almost have re pented. Such a course, however, would have been quite out of his line. He declined all office and public trust. He was no politi cian, or, perhaps, he was so good a one that he was content to occupy himself with his own personal interests. \" You're wery good,\" said he, when ap plied to to stand for the county ; \" wery good, indeed ; but do what you like without thinking o' me \u2014 I'm a plain man, and minds my own affairs.\" In old times, men used to travel over the whole world for the sake of an hour's conversation with a philosopher, we are about to travel into the next chapter to make the personal acquaintance of our worthy. c 2"], [40, "28 VALETTA CHAPTER II. Upon a certain fine autumn night, the moon was shining over the sea, whose silver line glistened far away in the distance. It was lighting up the brown track of the marsh, and throwing its clear, cold shadows among the fantastic gables of the little old town. It was a night for the Troiluses of Benchurch to sigh forth their souls upon the old ramparts ; for the Didos to wander \" by the wild sea banks.\" It Avas a night"], [41, "29 VALETTA. which was about to be illustrated as such a night deserved. At an early hour, the rattling to and fro of flys, glass coaches, and covered vans, through the old twisting streets, announced that some one in the town was awake, and inclined to make the most of that unusual occurrence. Inquiry was aroused, and it soon became generally known, that upon that night Miss Grantham was about to give her annual party; a festival remarkable as being the only occasion on which the great Squire Hardyman condescended to appear in society. \" If,\" said Napoleon, when at the height of his power, \" if I were to appear six nights running in my box at the opera, these people would be tired of me.\" Perhaps our Napoleon of the furrow was of the same way of thinking. More pro bably, he thought or cared nothing about these good folks, which is even a still better recipe for keeping up one's prestige."], [42, "30 VALETTA. But who was this Miss Grantham \u2014 this Med\u0153a, who could thus \" renew old \u00c6son?\" We must say a few words concerning her. There is a class of ladies in this land, where ladies are happily paramount, of which one or more specimens may be found in almost every town of the kingdom. They are neither young nor old, rich nor poor. They are neither entirely benevo lent, nor utterly malicious in their propen sities. They have their mild antipathies, and their aversions which smoulder and die away ; their yearnings for a woman's natural destiny, suppressed with extremest propriety, and stifled in the secret womb of thought; their charities dispensed with inquisitorial discrimination; their censure with liberality ; their tea ; their gossip ; and their comfortable conviction of final beatitude for themselves ; and their no less comfortable conviction of unpleasant endings for their neighbours. They pick their Avay nicely through our dirty"], [43, "31 VALETTA. thoroughfare of life; escaping all contact with its vices and virtues \u2014 its struggles, and the happiness which is their recom pense. Victims of society, their waste of years dwindles away ; and pinning their hopes to the skirts of their pet pastor's mantle, they put off their happiness, and postpone time to eternity. Miss Grantham, into whose house we are about to enter, was a member, and a fair average specimen of this class. Her age, her income, her disposition, were all about half way between the two extremes. Supported iu her isolation by the connection of her family with the neighbourhood, she saw the best society which the little place afforded ; and in the moments when the woman's heart slept within, and her digestion was in tolerable order, believed herself to be a not unhappy person, and one who really might, perhaps, on the whole, have been worse off. If she herself, at times, thought this, you may be sure that there were many"], [44, "32 VALETTA. more who were certain of it. Many, with long families and short commons, who per severingly overrated the spinster's income, and repined at the unequal distribution of fortune's gifts. Unequal \\\" \" Pauvres gens ! Je les plains, car on a pour les sous, Plusde pitie que de courroux.\" Is there no luxury in a life of robust labour? No recompense in the husband's honest love, and the children's brilliant smiles . Well, after all, perhaps there was no humble Cornelia among them who would have bartered these jewels of her's against all the frippery of which the poor spinster's dividends could give her the command. However, without tarrying longer in that clear night, let us follow in the course of the last glass coach, which we may easily do by slightly quickening our pace, and let us render ourselves into the drawing-room of Miss Grantham. It is that mysterious half-hour, during"], [45, "VALETTA. 33 which, while the gentlemen are still linger ing in the dining-room, the ladies assemble together to \u2014 who knows what? Possibly to frame those subtle weapons, and to mature those elaborate plans, by which all the male portion of creation are subjugated, and kept in subjection. The apartment appeared bright and brilliant compared with the night without, and though it was still early in the year, a merry fire was crackling on the hearth. (A spinster is generally the first person, in her neighbourhood, who finds that the rooms begin to look gloomy without a fire.) The apartment then was gay. Beyond this, there was nothing particularly re markable about it, unless it were an abundance of worked chairs, and fanciful and fragile ornaments, which spoke of abundant leisure, absence of those destruc tive entities little children, and the well trained docility of the sleek Persian cat c 5"], [46, "34 VALETTA. which reposed on a charming little presen tation rug in a corner. It is true that scattered about the room Avas a bevy of buxom dames, and charming fair girls, but even that is not remarkable in England, our truly fortunate country. \" See Naples and die,\" says the Italian. \" See the English women, and shut up your heart for ever ;\" that is, if your heart re mains your own to deal with. So might we fairly say, but we take the goods the gods provide us very quietly, and say nothing of the sort. A group of young ladies were standing round the fire, with the points of their little shoes resting on the polished fender, dis cussing bareges ; another group was cluster ing around a pretty creature with decided manners and fully developed shoulders who was declining to sing a Bulgarian hymn ; while over different portions of the room were scattered various small parties, all busily engaged in their own affairs, and their neighbours'."], [47, "35 VALETTA. Among these last was one consisting of three persons, who occupied a sofa in a re tired corner, and who, from the subdued and earnest tone in which they conversed, were evidently engaged upon a question of im portance. The centre of these three ladies was the mistress of the mansion. She was a slight woman with peering little dark eyes, mo bile features, and a restless frame. Had Miss Grantham, for such was her name, been married, she would have been admitted to be middle aged ; but as she was still a spinster, possessing very ade quate means, and giving very agreeable parties, no one ventured to take upon him self the responsibility of uttering so dan gerous an opinion. Public criticism whenever the topic was approached, threw a graceful ambiguity around it, and at the same time evaded the necessity for compromising itself, by de claring that Miss Grantham was an ex ceedingly agreeable person."], [48, "36 VALETTA. On the left of the hostess sat a fair lady in black satin, to whom public opinion could not have denied, however charitably disposed, the attribute of considerable em bonpoint. It is at all times invidious to indulge iu surmises on the age of ladies. The fact is that all women have one age \u2014 the age at which they please. Why seek to sub divide it into years? Why pull to pieces a rose to count its petals? Nevertheless, with regard to this par ticular rose, we may perhaps venture to hint that it Avas a full blown one. For as the mother of this lady, who made the third person on the sofa, being seated on the other side of the hostess, could not have been less than sixty, and as her daughter \u2014 the young lady with the developed shoulders \u2014 was certainly a well advanced rose-bud, it would not be altogether unwarrantable to conclude that her own age was somewhere between these two periods; nearer than this we positively decline to venture. A few words"], [49, "37 VALETTA. on these three ladies representing three generations. First, the grandmama, Lady Marrwell, on first sight, gave much the idea of a May-day sweep who had passed a rainy night in a water-butt, and had in the morning been hung out in a rough wind to dry. She leaned back in her corner a bundle of shreds and tatters of disordered finery. She had light hair and dark eyebrows, a little flush of colour immediately under the right eye, a corresponding little dab half way down the other cheek ; her nose was on one side, her mouth on the other, while knobs and tags of bugles, beads, coral, jet and stones were scattered profusely over her attire, which Avas perpetually disar ranging itself in some vital particular. This lady, Avho was the Avidow of a distinguished naval officer, had recently taken up her abode at Benchurch. The lady by her side was the widow of one of her sons. Of this latter personage there is not much to be recorded."], [50, "38 VALETTA. She was one of those women who are principally remarkable as forming a con necting link between their mothers and their daughters ; who have an intuitive gift of discovering the easiest chairs and the Avarmest corners, and of whom though they seldom absolutely sleep, it may fairly be doubted whether they have ever been thoroughly awake. After this evening we see nothing more of her. She has come to bring her daugh ter on a visit to the grandmama, and is about to return to her slumber else\\Arere\u2014- requiescat in pace. May her cushions re ceive her gently. Though she does no good she has no evil in her, and that in itself is a species of negative virtue. Of the grand-daughter we will pre sently speak : when the gentlemen have entered the room, for it is then that she properly comes upon the stage. In the meantime, we will take a part for a few moments in the conversation of the"], [51, "39 VALETTA. ladies on the sofa, and the most acceptable part is that of a listener. As these three ladies then sat apart from the rest of the society it was evident from the glances they occasionally threw around, as if to assure themselves that there was no one within ear-shot; from the emphatic and subdued tones of tbe lady in the centre, and from the earnest attention of the other two as they reclined among the cushions so grateful to their temperaments, that they were engaged on some topic in which they all took a more than ordinary degree of interest. \" Rich ! my dear madam ; he is as rich as \u2014 in short as rich as \u2014 \" \" Cr\u0153sus,\" suggested the youngest lady of the party, arousing herself especially for the occasion. \" Precisely \u2014 as Cr\u0153sus.\" \" And his daughter,\" said Lady Marr well, as, with an effort, she struggled up from her recumbent attitude snapping some thing as she did so, and looking anxiously"], [52, "40 VALETTA. at her hostess, \" is his daughter's fortune dependent on him?\" \" His grand-daughter's, you mean,' said Miss Grantham. \" Ah, his grand \u2014 \" \" Mama !\" exclaimed the younger lady, starting up with a rapidity of which she gave small promise, \" your brooch is com ing off again, let me arrange it for you,\" and, so saying, she busied herself about her mother's attire. As she did so she threw at her a glance so full of meaning that the old lady, who Avas preparing to repeat her question, put her hand before her mouth, coughed, and became silent. Miss Grantham, however, was one of those people who, when inclined to be com municative, do not require that a question should be repeated to them. \" Well,\" said she, \" that is rather a difficult question to answer. My old friend, Mr. Hardyman, is quite one of the old school \u2014 not very communicative on his"], [53, "VALETTA. 41 affairs, perhaps not sufficiently so. I think it probable that she is not \u2014 you know the mother married without his consent. A runaway match \u2014 Melville \u2014 lieutenant in a line regiment \u2014 mere man of straw \u2014 -small family \u2014 quite unknown in the county \u2014 died in a very inferior position \u2014 You'll take some coffee \u2014 Gave lessons, or something of that sort at five shillings a lesson \u2014 quite a domestic tragedy \u2014 Another lump of sugar? \u2014 the thing is not mentioned, of course. \u2014 Norley Court has been quite altered since then \u2014 entirely shut up. The children were taken home at the father and mother's death \u2014 Is it sweet enough now ? \u2014 and there they are still. Yes, I should say they are quite dependent, poor things ! However, this is certain, if the eldest marries in accordance with her grand-father's wishes she will be by far the richest heiress in the county.\" While the above conversation had been progressing the reluctant young lady had, in another part of the room, given way be fore the vehement entreaties of her friends,"], [54, "42 VALETTA. and the Bulgarian hymn had been raging for some minutes. That great cultivator of the liter\u00e6 humaniores, Dr. Johnson, once had to listen to a piece of music so difficult of execution that it was whispered to him that it was almost impossible. He abruptly replied that he wished it had been quite impossible. This Bulgarian hymn was just such a performance as would have given the emi nent cultivator of polite letters, an opening for one of his agreeable little speeches. First came the introduction, which, for anything it introduced, might just as rea sonably have come last. It consisted of a great deal of scampering up and down the keys, which like the gallop before a race, or the flourish of foils at the commencement of a fencing bout, served to supple the per former's hands and to prepare for all the terrible things which were about to happen. At length the air was started, a little simple thing, which like a hare was to be hunted to death over the instrument."], [55, "VALETTA. 43 First came one variation in which it got jammed up into the base, then another piu mosso in which it took refuge in a minor key, then- a third, in which it got back to a major key, and the old time, at the end of which it was finally staccato' d to death by a tremendous burst in the treble. Then came the rondo to celebrate the event, in which every now and then the ghost of the poor air would endeavour to intrude, and would be at once playfully, timorously, tremulously, or majestically shoved out again. Let us suppose that we have arrived at the middle of this rondo beatissimo : accor ding to the natural order of such perform ances, to so furious a storm of pedaling that it seemed as if the grand piano, the tympanum of your ears, and the great globe itself must give way, and that Saint Cecilia must forever disappear beneath \" the wreck of matter, and the crash of worlds,\" there all on a sudden, at the very moment when it was the least to be expected,"], [56, "44 VALETTA. succeeded a passage so soft, so hushed as though the gentle Zephyrus himself Avere wandering among the additional keys. Upon this delicious moment,, when the souls of the young ladies surrounding the instrument, caught glimpses of fairy land, and their lips murmured, \" Oh ! de \u2014 licious !\" The shrill voice of the hostess rang out the words. \" She is the richest heiress in the county.\" In an instant the spell Avas broken and the young ladies alighted on the earth again. Miss Merryton paused in her music, and wheeling abruptly round so as to face the party on the sofa, said, \" And who may be this mighty heiress, Miss Grantham ?\" \" Oh, who is it pray, my dear Miss Grantham,\" joined in the chorus of maidens, as the lady addressed, seemed to hesitate. \"But, why make a mystery of it?\" in quired the lady with the decided manners."], [57, "VALETTA 45 \" Of course, a thing of that sort every one must know.\" \" Exactly. Why make a mystery of it?\" chimed in the chorus. \" Well,\" said Miss Grantham, \" my dears, the young lady of whom I speak, is Miss Melville.\" \" Miss Melville !\" exclaimed every one. \" Certainly, Miss Melville. And why not?\" \" But no one has ever seen her.\" \" \u2014 Although she only lives a couple of miles off.\" \" Less ; Norley Court is not more than a mile and a half distant.\" \" And who is Miss Melville ?\" said the young lady with the decided manners. \" Mr. Hardyman's niece,\" exclaimed a chorus of voices. \" And who is this Mr. Hardyman, of whom you all make so much? How absurd to spoil a man so ! The horrid creatures are quite vain enough as it is.\" There was a pause."], [58, "46 VALETTA. Although, in the single week, during which she had been at Benchurch, Miss Merryton had completely established her as cendancy over the many bosom friends she had gained during that period, no one ven tured to laugh at this sally ; on the con trary, indeed, all stood looking at each other as if in expectation of some tremendous portent which was to follow and avenge such profanity. Miss Grantham, without appearing to notice the terrible speech, hastened to con tinue. \" Yes, my dears ; it was Miss Melville of whom we were speaking, and I am sure that\u2014\" \" But no one has ever seen her, my dear Miss Grantham. No one has ever pene trated inside the house.\" \"Except Mr. Scammony.\" \" Scammony ! ah ! then he shall tell me all about it this very night,\" cried Miss Merryton."], [59, "VALETTA. 47 \" Hu-u-ush ! dearest,\" murmured several young ladies. At this moment an approaching sound of voices burst upon the ear. Ladies, en garde, the enemy is at hand."], [60, "48 VALETTA. CHAPTER III. The gentlemen, then, were preparing to enter. In the meantime, the slightest possible flut ter was perceptible among the ladies. There was a rustling of silks \u2014 a drawing in of little feet \u2014 a rising from easy positions to the strict attitude of military \" attention.\" \" Clara, dearest,\" cried the young lady with decided manners, to one of her bosom friends, \" take that Bulga rian air from the piano, and hide it some-"], [61, "VALETTA. 49 where, there's a love \u2014 I would not sing it for worlds.\" The door opens. In streams a flood of coats. A tremendous moment this in our inter social relations. The ladies look somewhat conscious. The gentlemen very much so. Husbands quail beueath the conjugal glance, skilled to guage their condition to half a glass, while a vague uneasiness seizes even the most reckless bachelors. The men who had been the noisiest and the most authoritative, suddenly become silent and fall into the back ground ; and a panic begins to spread over the advanc- ing column. For a moment, it tries to make head \u2014 no, it will not do. In another minute those gay roysterers, with their black coats and flushed faces, whose mouths were just now full of battles, international, social, and political ; huntings ; barterings ; \" un common \" fine pointer dogs, and deuced pretty women, are irretrievably scattered vol. I. D"], [62, "50 ArALETTA. over the drawing-room, hunted into corners, seated summarily down on ottomans, and obliged to submit, with penitential teacups in their hands, to a reformatory course of conversation on autumnal tints and the divine Mario. As the group of gentlemen croAvded in at tbe door-way they still did so in such a manner, as to shew their deference for one who was in the midst of them, around whom they clustered, and smiled, and lis tened, with an eagerness which even, in the few moments, during which it lasted, was evident enough. The person who excited this general at tention, was a very old man, of an appear ance sufficiently singular. He was very short, and appeared still moreso,from the extreme disproportion of his figure. His body was square, and still retain ed the appearance of vigor \u2014 but it seemed far too long for the little, thick legs which had to support it. It seemed as if he had"], [63, "Valetta. 51 been rasee'd with a bo ly of the average size cut down and adapted to a chance pair of legs. The peculiarities of this figure were aggravated by the dress in which it was clothed. A white neckcloth, in a strange, ancient knot ; a frilled shirt-front escaping above the top of a buff-waistcoat, closely but toned to the chin, and extending down to the bottom of the body, aud below which an old cable pattern Avatch-chain, and huge dangling seals, descended half way down the right thigh ; a blue coat, the waist of which corresponded with the termination of the Avaistcoat, and whose tails extended below the knees. Then came the little legs in a pair of drab kerseymere trowsers, and the feet in a pair of thick soled shoes, of dim looking, soft leather, Avhich the wearer had, for many years, been accustomed to allude to complacently under the title \" my pumps.\" D 2"], [64, "52 VALETTA. Such was the man. A tolerable judge of character, who saw those square, flat, firmly planted little feet, taking root, as it were, on to the ground at each step, would at once have said, those feet can belong only to a man of determined will ; the little sturdy dogged legs told the same story, so did the troAvsers, the coat, the vest, self-dependent and defiant of all custom and prejudice, save its own \u2014 so did the square body, the deep chest, the massive shoulder and fore arm, the little, bronzed bunch of bone and muscle, which served as a hand. There was a peculiar look about that hand. It seemed as if such a hand could never have let go anything that it had once grasped. But it was above all in the head, that the character of the man was revealed. It Avas a small head, rising at once out of the body, without the inconvenience of an intervening neck. The jaws were square and firm, like the muzzle of a bull doc \u2014"], [65, "53 VALETTA. the mouth, thin, small, and drawn inwards \u2014 nose hke a hawk's beak \u2014 light grey hawk's eyes, set beneath overhanging shaggy brows, and a forehead which tapered up into a point, and was crowned by closely cropped, grey hair. Such Avas Squire Hardyman, who had succeeded in making himself considered as the \"first man in those parts.\" The Squire, in accordance with his grand principle of minding his own affairs, had, for many years, secluded himself almost entirely from all society. On the rare occasions, however, on which necessity, or rather that sacred necessity, his OAvn Avill, occasioned the solemn pulling on of \" my pumps,\" he, at the same time, in vested himself with a sort of antiquated gallantry, which fitted him still more uneasily than his shoe leather ; but which he had a vague idea was at once elegant in itself, and imperatively called for by the occasion. Under the influence of this sentiment,"], [66, "54 VALETTA. he, on entering the drawing-room, ad vanced at once to the mistress of the mansion, and said, \" Uncommon fine bit of fish ma'am.\" The lady bowed as a lady might, who knew that, in consequence of this remark, her fish would become as remarkable, through those parts, as the carp, in the fairy tale, which was caught with the princess's ring in its mouth. Place was made for the old Squire, and having called for a dish o' tea, he pro ceeded to make himself agreeable to the lady of the house, by a sort of amateur appraisement of her goods and chattels. In the meantime, the young lady, with the developed manners, had succeeded by one of those subtle accidents which disclose such eminent tact, in finding herself close to Mr. Scammony, whom she had previously predestined to \" tell her all about it.\" That we may estimate correctly the probable result of this approaching strugo-le"], [67, "55 VALETTA. of wits, we will take this opportunity to say a few words on the forces of the parties engaged. And first of the lady. Miss Merryton had left behind her, in that distant part of England, from which she had recently arrived, a large family of brothers and sisters. She had a sister older, and less brilliant than herself, who had recently made a prosperous marriage, and she had several sisters who, though younger than herself, were pressing hard upon her. She had likeAvise several brothers engaged in violent efforts to progress, and settle in life. The domestic speculations and manoeuvr ings, to which all this gave rise, and the memory of which she bore a way with her from those distant parts, had given to her character, Avhich, to a casual observer, appeared light, dashing, and insouciante, a good, solid, though secret substratum of the concrete of selfish ness ; and any one clear-sighted enough"], [68, "56 VALETTA. to follow her, Avould soon have found that her Avildest and apparently most objectless sallies, like the zigzag, doubling course of the wild animals of chase and warren, all invariably ended at home. Miss Merryton was one of those bounc ing, off-hand ladies, who set out with the determination of taking the world by storm ; who have sufficient wit to conceal their purpose ; sufficient animal energy to carry it on; and that useful, thick-skinned, deficient sensitiveness, which either prevents them from discovering that they are re buffed or from grieving at the discovery. This Thalestris then advanced into so ciety with the philanthropic declaration that she considered all men her brothers, and frankly avowed that she could see no difference between the sexes. These discoveries, like most others, are seldom made until they are likely to be come useful. The lady, in consequence of professing them, found that she had at once enfranchised herself, and that she had,"], [69, "57 VALETTA, at a bound, overleaped a hundred of those little reserves which custom and their own delicacy have imposed upon her sex. She accordingly advanced boldly on, aud meeting no obstacle in her path, imagined that she was progressing. Never Avas there a greater mistake. If a Avoman makes advances, she will find almost every man ready to meet her half way. There is a free and easy tone about her intercourse which suits a man who wishes to be amused. He is under no particular restraint \u2014 he makes no par ticular effort \u2014 or, if he does, it cannot fairly be invested with the tremendous sig nificance, which, under ordinary circum stances, would be given to anything like special attentions. The lady is quite satisfied Avith the re sult of her system of warfare, until she finds that, in the mean time, some little sly puss in a corner, who answers that de vouring and terrible monster, man, in D 5"], [70, "58 VALETTA. monosyllables, and whose eyes can never get quite so high as his, is sure to be the one to subdue him. A painted fly for a cockney's hat. but a brown hackle to kill the fish. Be sure of this, the Avoman who outsteps the reserve of her sex, has stepped out from her stronghold, deprived herself of half her chance in the battle, and exposed her self to all the stray shots of her enemies. She may deceive herself with the appear ance of success ; but if she knew men better, she would know that they most openly follow that Avhich they the least in wardly affect \u2014 that to the better style of men there is no grace which can com pensate for the absence of feminine grace, and that, while she thinks they are rapt in admiration, they are in reality excusing her extravagances on the plea of her good nature. The end of such a career is for the most part a sad one. It Avill be her fate,"], [71, "VALETTA. 59 poor girl, to catch a fool, a green horn, or an imbecile ; and to domineer at a cheer less fireside, opposite to a husband whom she rules and despises. Such is the general rule, though, in re ferring to it, we are not taking the liberty of thus summarily disposing of the desti nies of our acquaintance Miss Merry toil, who, whatever may be in store for her, in the future, finds, at present, things going very favourably, for she finds the men courting her society without making the young ladies, her bosom friends, very jealous. Perhaps, this may partly arise from a secret suspicion, on the part of these young ladies, that she is not a very dangerous rival ; for women are wonderfully quick- Avitted, and can probe a man's ideas on certain subjects better than he can himself. Partly, perhaps, it arises from the ascen dancy which she has acquired among them, and which she owes to her highly tinted anecdotes of desperate leaps taken by her"], [72, "60 VALETTA. in the course of rides with cavalry officers ; of her stalls at charitable sales ; of the way in which she got up theatricals, under apparently desperate circumstances ; and of the arduous parts she sustained therein ; of the duel which would have taken place about her glove, had not something inter- vened to prevent it ; and of the highly eligible young man, of admirable beauty, romantic character, excellent connections, and adequate means, Avho was dying for \u2014 had, probably, by this time, died for her, and who would, at that moment, have been her liege lord, if \u2014 probably \u2014 if he had not thought better of it, for no one can ever find any other sufficient reason for the breaking off these matters, on which every thing smiles, and which accordingly come to nothing. These, and a hundred other blagues, by which girls administer to each others' appetite for the marvellous, had, added to her decided and presumptuous bearing, rendered Miss Merryton an authority in"], [73, "Valetta. 61 this little society, as similar qualities pro duce a similar effect in larger arenas ; and her music, her dress, her manners, and her opinions, in a few weeks, became \"the cynosure of neighbouring eyes\" at Ben church. This was the lady ; and now for her an tagonist. Mr. Scammony was a bachelor of forty five, and what is familiarly known, as a \" general practitioner\" in the healing art, in which capacity he was in the confidence of all residents within radii of five miles from Benchurch. Like others similarly situated, he had a neat, bachelor box, which would have seemed an elysium, had it not been for the ideas of discomfort suggested by, and associ ated with the word \"night- bell\" engraved on a brass plate on the door post. He had a highly respectable young person of the niece de cure genus, who officiated as his housekeeper. He had a sombre brougham, with the latest improvements in lamps ; little"], [74, "62 VALETTA. tearing horses, and the most patient and melancholy of drivers, in a glazed hat. He, from time to time, forwarded commu nications to the well-known medical peri odical \" The Probang,\" and received a con stant supply of leeches by post. In all this, he was like very many other medical practitioners. Unlike many others, however, he possessed a shreAvd wit, which enabled him to study, successfully, the great variety of characters continually presented to his notice, and to deduce therefrom very profitable results. In attendance upon this keenness was a strong propensity for a joke. It is not every man \u2014 above all, it is not every medical man who can afford to joke \u2014 but Avhen one has arrived at forty-five, and is highly prosperous, aud quite indispensable, his wit smacks of consols, and is ac ceptable. The Doctor, then, Avould never abstain from his joke, though the malady took with him a dangerous turn. Mystification"], [75, "63 VALETTA. and solemn hoaxing Avere his delight. Ac cordingly, when Miss Merryton addressed him, he bowed gravely, and prepared to enjoy himself after his kind. The little man\u0153uvre of her approach had not been lost upon him. Few things were. \" Ah ! my dear Miss Merryton,\" said he, \" you see 1 have been seeking you out to beg a favour of you.\" \" Of me ! W hat is it possible that I can do for you, Mr. Scammony _ I am sure I shall be most happy.\" \" So I ventured to hope.\" \" Oh ! stop though, you naughty man \u2014 anything but one. Do not ask me to sing.\" \" Ah ! you ladies !\" exclaimed the Doctor, raising his hands in mimetic despair. \" The very thing I was going to ask for.\" He had never thought of it ; but did not scruple to take credit for it, when he found that he could do so with impunity."], [76, "64 VALETTA. \" Oh ! don't ask me to-night. You have no idea what a throat I have.\" The Doctor balanced a tea-spoon. \" A throat,\" he said ; \" that is a very serious thing \u2014 let me examine it.\" \"Quelle idee!\" exclaimed the young lady ; \" you monster. Were you positively going to put that horrid spoon into my mouth. ' \" Why, I thought you said \u2014 \" \" No, but don't ask me to sing. I have my reasons,\" said the young lady, pressing the subject. \" I won't,\" replied the Doctor, with equal earnestness, and much greater sin cerity. \" I won't indeed. I'll take care that no one shall. I respect your reasons without knowing them. They do you credit; they do, indeed.\" \" No, but seriously,\" said the lady. \" I am always serious,\" replied the doctor. Scammony w7as a portly man with a roguish, twinkling, black eye, bronzed"], [77, "65 VALETTA. cheeks, and a mouth, which, at moments like the present, when he was especially enjoying one of his jokes, he managed to purse up into an expression of preter natural gravity. He delighted in the young lady ; she was a source of never ending amusement to him ; he saw through her so utterly. \"I am always serious, my dear young lady,\" said he. \" I want to talk to you then seriously ; I want to ask you all about Miss Mel ville.\" \" Hush !\" said the doctor, turning his head rapidly round. \" There ! how provoking ! exactly Avhat every one says. What possible cause can there be to make a mystery about this Miss Melville.\" \" Hush ! not so loud,\" whispered the doctor, placing his arm on hers. \" There \u2014 there is a seat in that corner. Let us go and sit down.\" In the course of the conversation, which"], [78, "66 VALETTA. in the retirement of this corner, the doctor entered into, he from time to time turned his eyes in the direction of the Squire, who having soon tired of conversation had been seated down to the annual rubber at backgammon with Miss Grantham, which invariably formed a part of this eventful evening's solemnities. The old gentleman was utterly absorbed in his game, poring over the board, rattling the dice, and as they fell proclaiming the numbers aloud. When they were favour able to him, he was all elation ; when they were adverse he was instantly dejected, murmuring to himself and peering into the dice boxes as if suspecting something wrong. The fact is, that throughout all the three hundred and sixty-five days of the year, this rubber of backgammon was the only matter in which he placed himself within the power of chance. In all the other moves of his life he calculated his course with such prudential nicety that fortune"], [79, "67 VALETTA. had no chance of tripping him up. Here he was all abroad, and felt as anxious and diffident as a person who ventures for the first time on the ice. His opponent, in the meantime, sat up right, a rigid smile fixed on her face. She well knew what was to be the result of the rubber about Avhich the old gentleman was so anxious. As the game progressed, the various guests, amused by the excitement of the old Squire, and desirous of witnessing this sham contest, which was a matter of county history, croAvded round the table. During the early part of the first game, Mr. Hardyman from time to time addressed a few remarks to them, but Avhen one of his pieces had been taken up and the plot began to thicken, he lost all sense of their presence, and saw nothing but his board and the hand opposing. For some years the doctor had, on these anniversaries, been in the habit of standing at the table betting against the Squire,"], [80, "68 VALETTA. and prophecying his defeat, recompensed for the money, whicli he knew before hand he Avas certain to lose, by the satis faction of Avitnessing the dismay which his adverse opinion occasioned. The Squire, however, took the matter very seriously to heart ; and the doctor, on his side, taking into consideration that his friend Avas very old ; that he was his medical attendant : and that in the course of things he could not last very long, poor old gentleman, and that his wealth Avas great, suppressed his joke. As Mr. Scammony, however, from the distant corner into which he had retired, for the two-fold purpose of removing him self from temptation, and of preventing the young lady from committing any in discretion in her allusions, witnessed the progress of the game, the thought sug gested itself to him \u2014 \" What if I were to set on this young baggage to bait the Squire ;\" and as he thought it, he pursed up his lips with in-"], [81, "69 VALETTA. tense solemnity. \" Is she equal to it 1 Can she go through with it 1\" and he threw a little inquiring glance out of the corner of his sly black eyes over the face of his companion. The young lady finding herself thus carried into a retired part of the room by a gentleman who she considered had al ready paid her very marked attention, cast down her eyes, and began to arrange the whole affair in paragraphs for the benefit of her friends on the morrow. Several moments passed away ; the Doctor remained silent \u2014 Poor man! was he nervous . Perhaps the least, wee little bit of encouragement \u2014 for shame! quelle idee I well ! She just raised her soft lids, and threw a glance at him \u2014 such a glance ! It was at this moment that the Doctor was engaged in his scrutiny. Their eyes met. The Doctor nodded his head quietly to himself. \" I've no fear,\" thought he ;"], [82, "70 VALETTA. \" the young baggage is equal to anything. Now to begin V ' He crossed his legs, spread his handker chief over them, produced his snuff-box from a breast-pocket, Avhich lay im mediately over his heart, and tapped three taps on its lid. Certainly a declaration could not possibly commence in that fashion. The young lady raised herself in her seat, and turned her eyes full and curiously upon the Doctor. He took a pinch of snuff Avithout spilling a grain. He was a man Avith a salamander spirit ; he delighted in a crisis, and was never so much in his element as in a con versation where a single word misplaced would bring on a serious denouement. He bowed in the intensity of his self-apprecia tion.

It has often been declared that an heiress is the most unfortunate of her sex, because of all women she has the least chance of meeting with that sincere and disinterested affection, on the hopes of which her hap piness, as a woman, is based. Men of honorable and independent minds shun her, because though her per sonal and intrinsic merits might have been sufficient to have attracted them, had she been poor, or but moderately endowed, yet"], [90, "78 VALETTA. the fear of being thought to aim at her belongings over balances her attractions. The only chance, therefore, the poor rich one has, is to seek out from the mercenary crowd around her the one least likely to abuse her bounties. Such is the theory on the subject. It may, or may not, be a correct one. Pro bably it is not. But nevertheless, after all, there is something to be said for thc mer cenary man. TavcIvc months after mar riage your adorers have cooled down Avonderfully ; but the mercenary dog, who has just handed you into your carriage, at the Bank door, with your second half yearly dividend in your pocket, does not think much thc worse of you because your second six months of wedded pilgrimage has completed itself. There is a very enduring cosmetic quality about that same despised gold of yours. Like other cosmetics, however, it has its disadvantages as well as its ad vantages, and perhaps if the wealthy knew"], [91, "79 VALETTA. exactly the plans and schemings of Avhich they were the centre, they Avould turn Timons, and flee the world. They do not, however, and never will. \" Curse not the rich man even in thy bed- chamber\" said King Solomon, and the maxim has been well understood, and acted upon. During the night Avhich succeeded Miss Grantham's party, two new ambitions had built themselves up upon the foundation of the young heiress of Norley's wealth. Ambition can never be pronounced in ordinate until we know that the resources of the aspirant are inadequate to the per formance of his object. Let us then take a peep at these two .plans. The first of them took its origin in the breast of a tall, robust youth, with a florid face and curly hair, a sort of nursemaid's Adonis, who had been present at Miss Grantham's party. This youth Avas the son of a neigh bouring proprietor, of some consideration. He had come especially under Mr. Hardy-"], [92, "80 VALETTA. man's notice, on the night of the party, in consequence of the old gentleman having trodden on his toes, in his passage into the drawing-room after dinner. \" Ask pardon. I hope I see you well, sir,\" growled the Squire. \" Happy to see you at Norley, if you'll look me up some day after luncheon.\" The Squire had, for some time, had his eye upon this youth, whose father was in delicate health, and he had come to the determination that he would eventually have a deal with the lad for a few of his acres \u2014 a few tolerably hearty acres \u2014 the cream of the estate. The old gentleman had them marked out on his map, and felt that they would just suit him if he could get them \" a bit reasonable.\" To the youth, however, whom nature had intended for a dupe, having given him the modicum of cunning, and the great amount of vanity, which combine to make men think themselves knowing, and having, likewise, given him just enough of cupidity"], [93, "81 VALETTA. to set him in motion, and get him into danger \u2014 to the ingenuous youth, this little speech bore a very different signification. It at once occurred to him that the Squire intended to bestow his grand daughter upon him in marriage, as being the most worthy of all probable aspirants. As he stood glancing with downward eyes at the perfections of a pair of tight legs, large boots, and a square-cut coats which fastened, by means of a miniature silver snaffle, over a vest of most brilliant device, he determined that he would not \" go cheap,\" but make hard terms with the old boy. This was Mr. Felix Oxton's first view of the subject ; and no reflection occurred to his mind, during the night, Avhich served to alter it. The second scheme which stood the test of the morning sun \u2014 that terrible clearer up of the mists of idle imaginings \u2014 had been framed in the brooding brains of the E 5"], [94, "A'ALETTA. 82 poor, old Lady Marrwell and her daughter ; and, as it would, probably, be some time before another idea, equally original and elaborate, originated in the same source, they Avere naturally desirous that it should ccme to a happy consummation. This great combination was, accordingly, imparted to Miss Merryton Avho, having, as a general principal, declined to yield her self to controul, had been, in consequence, alloAved to exercise it. It turned out that it had been devised between this pair of fond old Avomen, that a certain brother of Miss Merryton's should be called in to over- Avhelm the heart of the heiress ; and with her wealth, illustrate the fortunes of his house. This \" Knight of proof, in love's behoof, The thirst of fame his warrant,'' had risen to be a lieutenant in a line re<ri ment. He Avas necessarily much from home ; and what his family principally kneAv of"], [95, "valett!_. 83 him was, that they had already beeu obliged to pay his debts for him, and that they might soon hope to have an opportu nity of purchasing him a company. As, however, he wrote at intervals to say that he had received their remittances, and that he was enjoying himself ex tremely, they Avere well pleased, and saw nothing in his conduct to make them doubt that he would both succeed in anything he might take in hand, and also prove worthy of his success. A Avoman reasons by her heart instead of her head. If she incline, one may be silent \u2014 she is already convinced. If she be disinclined, you may hold your peace ; your rhetoric and logic is Avasted on the winds. The two ladies had, very natu rally, voted their swan a black one, and were never tired of cackling over the rara aris. Miss Merryton was pleased graciously to approve of the scheme proposed to her, and at once, promised it her support ; in"], [96, "/aletta. 84 furtherance of which resolution, she ordered out the carriage, determining to start off on that very morning to take the necessary preliminary step of enlisting the unknown heiress into the ranks of that numerous regiment, her bosom friends. Accordingly, as the day advanced, a sleek little pony trotted round to the spinster's door, between the shafts of a softly cushioned little chaise, in which a sleepy little groom sat in an upright posi tion, evidently far from congenial to his tastes and habits. After the lapse of that three quartersof an hour, during Avhich the looking-glass keeps the whole world waiting ; and during which, the little pony had killed the only two flies in Benchurch with its tail, and then gone to sleep to celebrate its exploit \u2014 during Avhich, also, the little groom had gradually fallen back among the cushions, the door, at last, opened, and Miss Merryton tripped forth to conquest, armed with a bright"], [97, "VALETTA. 85 blush, and bright eyes, and the most be coming of all possible pink bonnets. Lady Marrwell presently followed her grand-daughter ; and, after many misgiv ings, she, at length, happily packed herself into the pony carriage, and the pair drove off in the direction of Norley. They received, as they cleared the town, a most gracious salute from Mr Scammony, who was, as usual, on the look out ; Avho knew precisely where they were going ; and could, if required, have furnished a tolera bly shrewd guess as to the motives which took them \u2014 as, indeed, he could have done on most of the events which took place in the neighbourhood. Had his inclination been in that direction, he could have even given them a few invaluable hints on the matter. But noAV, let us avail ourselves of our privilege, to outstrip the pace of the little sleek pony, and take a peep at Norley Court and its unknown heroine, before the arrival of the visitors."], [98, "86 VALETTA. The little village of Norley was distant some two short miles from Beuchurch. It consisted of a few scattered cottages, which lay in the holloAV of a hill, and were covered in from all the winds of Heaven by numerous and luxuriant elms. From the village a road Avound upwards to the church, an old Norman building Avith a square ivy-covered tower. On the left of the low breast Avail which led into the sacred precinct was a swing carriage gate, and a drive which, passing through a short avenue of old trees, led directly up to the front of a building of a somewhat singular appearance. Though of great length, it rose only two stories from the ground. Above these sloped a high tiled roof, from which at in tervals clustered up huge piles of chimneys. There was an air about the building which conveyed at once the idea of its great antiquity, and Avhich at the same time affected the mind with a sentiment of an almost melancholy character, not the"], [99, "87 VALETTA. less depressive because vague, and without apparent cause. Its front was of red brick, almost entirely concealed by the dark masses of ivy which had for centuries been struggling to invade it, and which had been from time to time cut away to permit the still air, and as much of the dim light as could penetrate among the deep surrounding trees, to find their way through the old stone mullioned latticed Avindows, into the interior of the mansion. There was another spot where the ivy had also been jealously excluded. It Avas a large square space immediately over the low entrance porch. In the centre of this space, where no sun could hope to penetrate, stood a huge old sun-dial, preserved probably for the sake of its antiquity and of the moral Avhich it conveyed in these words \u2014 \" To morrow we die.\" From generation to generation as each heir succeeded to the estate, and starting"], [100, "88 VALETTA. fresh in life repaired the old mansion, he would not have considered his work as complete, or surveyed it from the little dank grass plot in front with complacency, unless he had conformed to the invariable custom, and saAv himself greeted by the motto \u2014 '\u2022 To-morrow we die,\" renovated and picked out afresh for his own especial edification. This old building then was Norley Court, and stood, as tradition went, upon the spot once occupied by one side of a square of buildings, which in the old days had served as a palace for Saxon kings. So at least ran the legend, and indi cations of this high antiquity might have been traced here and there in the rough masses of stone, portions of the original fabric, which had been worked up into the walls of the more modern edifice. We are about to enter the mansion ; and though so old fashioned a place, with such old fashioned inhabitants, presents but little inci dent, Ave venture to assure our fair readers"], [101, "89 VALETTA. that if their patience will carry them through it, or their ingenuity enable them to evade it, there are strange and eventful matters in the back-ground. On entering, the visitor would find him self in a narrow, dark passage, along whose sides hung several old garments and old portraits, all of antiquated cast, and far advanced in the \" sear and yellow \" season of decline. In front is a narrow staircase of dark wood, with quaint old twisted banisters. On the first landing thereof, at the spot where the stairs turn off at right angles to carry the ascent to the upper floor, is an old cabinet in carved and richly inlaid wood, which seems to crouch and hide it self in the very wall, as if conscious of occupying an undue and inappropriate space. At the bottom of this staircase are tAvo doors ; the one on the left is the entrance to the general family room, in which the meals are taken, and those hours passed during which the family is assembled"], [102, "90 VALETTA. The door on the right is low, and clad in green baize; it shuts with a spring, on pushing which it opens gently, and the visitor finds himself in a vast, square hall, Avith a bricked floor, and with long, narrow windows extending high up its sides. In the lower parts of these Avindows modern panes have been inserted, but towai'ds the top they are still latticed to preserve the old stained glass, on which appear the effigies of certain holy men of eld, and the arms and quarterings, and de vices connected with the family history, carefully and richly blazened forth. On one side of this hall is a huge over hanging fire place, with a mantel in carved oak. The hearth is fined with white slabs, of the old Dutch Avare, on some of which may be traced, in worn and fading blue, lines which symbol forth the fortunes of the house of Hardyman. At first sight there is a hearty, promising look about this old centre of hospitality, an impression, however, which a more minute"], [103, "VALETTA. 91 inspection soon serves to dissipate. The grate, a little meagre affair, which would not warm a broom closet, is cold and bright and unconscious of fire, and in front of it is perched up a thin, black, illomened stove, to which are entrusted the duties of keeping out the cold, and keeping up the cheer of those whom fate leads to the spot. In short, there is a chill and a blight upon the place, and this is only one of many indications of it. The furniture is scant. There are the old straight chairs, like starch, uncomfortable dowagers, with their car ved backs and crazy invalid look, and their fancy velvet seats. There are several ricketty tables Avhich seem bewildered and lost in that large space. Upon them are perched rare China jars, desecrated and applied to the meanest utilitarianisms. One contains a sample of seed set forth to dry ; another contains cattle medicines ; a third chemical manures ; a fourth a p ot pourri of horrors."], [104, "92 VALETTA. In the corners of the hall, shirking away behind the old cabinets, which here and there rear themselves up, are other jars, their fellows, jostling together like other persecuted classes to escape indignity, and compare opinions on their misfortunes. And those old cabinets with their inter minable carvings and twistings and secret drawers and pigeon holes and strange de vices for stowing aAvay strange things: \u2014 if some daw or magpie of laxest morality had had the superintendence of them, they could not have been filled with a more hetero geneous mass of rubbish. Old garments, fragments of wax candles, morsels of ropes' end, rusty metal, corks, cobler's wax, and the thousand shreds and patches of house hold sweepings long since dead, for all use ful purposes, but which a mistaken economy cannot make up its mind to bury, or which the lust of proprietorship still fondly per suades itself may be resuscitated. The old portraits on the wall, those strange, damp old shadows of the past, look"], [105, "VALETTA. 93 down gloomily on the scene around. The moisture stands in drops on them, or slowly trickles down their faces ; there is a sus picion of mildew on their gallant cloaks and doublets, and their very wigs seem to be coming uncurled. And yet they have lived' and sinned gaily in their time. Poor old fellows ! What a punishment for a man's own neglect of duties would it be if he were doomed, like those poor portraits, to witness those follies of his descendents which are its consequence. Who shall say which is the greater curse, an unwise father or a foolish son ; and who shall say how much they depend on each other! Well, let us enjoy life in honesty. Let us do good and receive good in our gene rations. We have little to do with the past \u2014 little to do with the future ; for before we can get to them we have the present to deal with. We are half way up the hill. It is a narroAv, dangerous road, and a heavy soil, and precipices on"], [106, "94 VALETTA. all sides. The carriage labours. Are we to look back and expatiate on the country we have passed, the fair plain beloAV, or to crane up and peer and speculate on Avhat is far aAvay on the hills beyond us, at the end of to-morroAv's journey. God forbid ! The carriage labours \u2014 Our duty is simple \u2014 Shoulders to the wheel \u2014 Heart and hand to the task. Being men of to-day, let us labour and love in our own generation, and leave yesterday or to-morro av to them selves. Let the dead bury their dead, and let the unborn take thought for each other. For there is \" nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works, for that is his portion : for Avho shall bring him to see what shall be after him ?\" So preached the inspired King, who gave himself up to the search after Avisdom, and who, at the end of all, \"perceived\" that \" this Avas the truth, and that there was nothing better.\" Such, hoAve\\'er, was by no means the view taken of life by Mr. Hardyman, to."], [107, "95 VALETTA. whom, to enjoy the gifts of fortune, and to \" eat sufficiently,\" as the wise man counsel leth, of the honey which he had found, and Avas constantly storing, would have seemed a sin, and a shame, and an error, \" leading straight to the work' us.\" As it was said of Rudolph, Emperor of Russia, by Karamsin the historian, that he was habile chimiste, astronome, bon ecuyer, et fort mauvais monarque, so it might have been said of the Squire, that he was a skilful agriculturist, a good judge of the weather, and an uncommonly bad master of the house. The frozen pole of his avaricious nature, formed a centre, round which the little domestic world revolved miserably. On the side of the hall opposite to the green baized door, was a low, open arch, which led into another passage, ter minating in a flight of stairs, of a character superior to those mentioned above. These led to the draAving-room, and to a state bed-room, neither of which were used,"], [108, "96 ArALETTA except on rare occasions of domestic im portance. At the bottom of this staircase, on the right, was a door which led into a little room, whose windows looked out on the front. This room was sacred to the Squire, who \u2014 no one could say whether seriously, or in pursuance of some deeply devised joke \u2014 christened it his \"study.\" The hall had the effect of dividing the house into two parts, being the only means of communication between the drawing room, the state bed-room, and the Squire's study, which were on the one side, and the rest of the house which was on the other. It took in the whole height of the house with the exception of the slope in the roof. This roof contained a nest of garrets, which had originally formed an upper communication between the two sides of the house ; but which, having been found useless during the Squire's economic"], [109, "VALETTA. 97 reign, had been dismantled, and the outlet from them into the state apartment walled up. A few of these chambers were still used as lumber and store-rooms ; but the greater number remained locked and boarded up, unknown, unthought of, and unexplored except on those rare occasions when the Squire's two grand-daughters, grasping each others hands, and holding their breath with anxiety, would venture among them. These expeditions, however, were secret as well as of rare occurrence, for the Squire, though he generally did not attempt to interfere with any amusements of the children, so long as they cost nothing, had always evinced a dislike, amounting to a sort of nervous repugnance, to their going near this set of rooms. From this old hall there was another door which opened upon the back of the house. It led into an old fashioned garden of considerable extent. On one side of this garden ran the low, bulging wall of the churchyard, over which VOL. I. F"], [110, "98 VALETTA. the creeping ivy reared itself curiously, as if desirous to peep into the fair garden ground beyond. Close on the Squire's side of this wall, stood an enormous ilex, one half of which threw a shade into the garden, while the other sheltered a solitary grave, Avhich lay nestled close up to the wall within the sacred precinct. A long slip of lawn, as smooth and level as a boA\\ ling-green, extended in a direct line from the house to the end of the garden, where it Avas terminated by a sunk fence, and a row of magnificent Elm-trees, through Avhose branches, again, might be caught glimpses of the upland meadow slopes, Avhich rose gradually up, and bounded the horizon. On the side of the garden opposite to the church- wall, there flourisheda wilderness of fruit trees, and domestic plants, into which, those avIio desired to penetrate might find a path in the long turfed alleys,"], [111, "VALETTA. 99 lined with the fruit-laden espaliers, which supplied the place of ordinary walks. There is something singular and inter esting in the spot. The autumn sun shines down glowingly. It lights up the garden ground, throwing its rays among the rustling leaves and ruddy fruit. Into that spot it seems to penetrate cheerily, and with a hearty good grace, like the visitor who feels that he brings a welcome presence, and is assured of his reception. Among the deep, red, time-stained gables and fantastic chimneys of the old house it shines more cheerily, lighting up one spot brilliantly, and leaving another in deep shadow, like a man afraid to ex pand himself in society which is not alto gether congenial, or of which he is not altogether assured. Then there is the long, gray outline of the old church, and here the sun shines not. It reposes in deeper shadow.

One of them, the eldest, a girl between seventeen and eighteen, is seated on the ground. The younger, who is fourteen has more sedately placed herself on a basket at her sister's side. They are busily occupied in weaving a rustic wreath from a little heap of simple flowers which lie at their side.

The other dramatis persons? to make up this little idyllic group, consisted of first, a spaniel ; a fat, feeble, barbarously wTell-fed beast of a \" Juno,\" which basked in the sunshine, and dreamed of the rug before the fire ; a wonderful animal which (it was told in a whisper,) dated back to the times of \" poor mama.\" Secondly, there was a peacock of great dignity ; and thirdly, in a Avindow at the top of the house a puppy, a desperate Quirk \u2014 Valetta's especial pet and prime mischief-maker, who having insisted in tearing away Avith the flowers, and snap ping at the Avreath itself, had been carried off in his mistress's arms to the nursery, where Avith his two hind legs on a chair,"], [119, "107 VALETTA. and his fore-paws resting on the Avindow sill, he stood attentively Avatching the pro ceedings, at times bursting into a short monosyllabic bark to attract his mistress's eye, and just to give her to understand that in spite of reformatory imprisonments he Avas determined steadfastly to persevere in his evil courses. Profiting by his mortal enemy's disgrace, the stately peacock threw off something of his habitual reserve, and approached suffi ciently near to Valetta, the only person in whom he reposed entire confidence, to allow her to try the effect of the Avreath, by placing it round his neck, \u2014 a little feat attended with much merriment and clap ping of hands on the part of the maidens, and much feathering up and conceit on his side. In the midst of all this the disenchanting sound of the Squire's sharp voice was heard calling \" Waletta.\" Up started the girl to meet \"dear grandpapa \" at the house-door."], [120, "108 VALETTA. \" You ain't been and pulled any of the warigated sage, have you,\" said the old man. The girl placed both her hands, with the wreath in them, behind her back, and looked up at him 'with the most darling little mutinous smile in her eyes. \" I say \u2014 you arn't though, 'ave you .\" repeated the Squire, earnestly. The smile in Valetta's eyes spread to her lips, she nodded a little confession, and bursting into a merry laugh took to flight. \" Oh ! lor';\" said the old man, shaking his head ; \" how uncommon like her mother that gal's a growing ; but I can't have the warigated sage pulled up for all that, and so that's the long and short of it.\" And the Squire, perfectly indifferent as to the fate of the other flowers, determined to preserve intact his salvias, which, under the name and image of variegated sage were respectable in his utilitarian eyes. But now to return to the little pony car-"], [121, "VALETTA, 109 riage, which, like some unforeseen visitation about to break in upon the happiness of our life, and awake us from our sweet world dream, has all this time, under the guidance of the fair Merryton, been steadily ap proaching Norley Court. At length they have succeeded in thread ing the little wondering village ; they have turned in at the solemn old drive, and have finally paused with a tremendous ring at the entrance door of the Court itself. Thus far the adventure went well, but its difficulties had hardly commenced. The bell sounded with startling loudness through the old mansion. The rooks, scared at the unwonted sound, rose circling up from among the trees in clamouring protest against the intrusion, while the dogs bayed in the adjacent farm buildings. From Avithin, however, there was no sign or sound ; the echoes of the bell died away, and all was silent again. Five minutes, ten minutes elapsed, dur ing which the elder lady endeavoured to"], [122, "110 VALETTA. decide whether a missing bracelet had been left at home, or was irrecoverably lost on the road \u2014 andthe younger one, like aknight of romance bracing up his armour at the approach of the hour of peril, adjusted her invincible pink bonnet. \" What a stupid, stupid old place it is,\" said she, cutting with her whip at a draggled pullet, which had stepped forth to gaze. \" Ring again \u2014 ring well \u2014 we'll wake them up.\" Again the little page pulled his best, and again the bell sounded louder than before, and again the rooks and dogs pro tested. \" This will never do. There is no one at home, mj dear,\" urged Lady Marrwell, Avhose mind was running upon the form of a hand-bill for the recovery of her missing bracelet, and who Avas anxious to get back forthAvith to Benchurch to take the opinion of the circulating librarian on the subject. \" My dearest grandmama,\" said the young lady, \" there must be some one at"], [123, "111 VALETTA. home.

All was silent \u2014 no, stop! there was a footstep in the hall \u2014 the garrison were at length brought to a parley \u2014 there was the undoing of a chain ; the shooting back of a bolt, and the door slowly opened. Intrenched cautiously behind it, stood a little, meagre, red-haired serving man in a striped calico jacket. He appeared to be about sixty, and on his face reposed an ex pression of as dogmatical self-sufficiency as can well be arrived at during that number of years.

The factotum shook his head vaguely, but with determination. \" Impossible- de toute impossibilite. \\ The Squire was out \u2014 uncertain when he would return,\" &c. In the mean time the Squire, who, at the very first alarm, had hastened into his little study which commanded a view of the front door, and having at one glance comprehended the gravity of the crisis, and given his orders accordingly, was con cealed behind a window curtain smothering his smile with his hand, and enjoying the discomfiture of his fair enemy. \" Well done, little Jacob,\" said he, \" stoutly done, Jacob. Oh, Lor' ! there goes the young baggage a-lashing at the poultry with her whip. Off with 'em, little Jacob, - \u2014 that's it. We don't want none of that sort here!\" As he said this a light hand was laid upon his old flannel jacket, and a musical merry laugh rang out in his ear."], [125, "113 VALETTA. \" Well done! Mr. Hardyman, stoutly done, Mr. Hardyman ! Off with 'em, Mr. Hardyman.\" The Squire turned, and the wicked eyes and rosy cheeks, and the invincible pink bonnet were before him."], [126, "114 VALETTA. CHAPTER V It is a particularly disagreeable moment that in which one suddenly finds himself in contact with a person he has been doing his best to avoid, and Avho knows it. The pair looked at each other for some moments in silence, the young lady's eyes wanderingover the old gentleman's costume, which was the same as on the previous evening except that \" my pumps \" had been superseded by a huge pair of nailed high-loes, and that his blue dress-coat had"], [127, "VALETTA. 115 given place to a short flannel carpenter's jacket. It was in this jacket that the Squire in vested himself when engaged in this strange little study of his, in making up his log, squaring his books, taking his observa tions on the weather, and the other im portant pursuits of his domestic moments. When once the Squire had donned his flannel jacket he was invisible to the Avhole world. No man could see him until the hour had arrived at which he had pre determined to take it off again, and he had been known to send away even those who came to pay money rather than break through his rule. Being thus suddenly surprised in this sacred and most ungraceful garment, he was astonished out of his cynicism, which on ordinary occasions was his safest Aveapon, and he was for a moment undecided how to act. He glanced at the door, and then at the lady, who, as if divining his intention, at"], [128, "116 VALETTA. once drew back a pace or two and placed herself iu such a position as to prevent the possibility of his escape. Then he looked at his hands, but the sight of the old flannel sleeves, which half covered them, by no means served to reassure him, and he thrust them rapidly behind his back. In that position, how*ever, they at once reminded him of the absence of those skirts in which a decorous age has seen fit that our coats should terminate, and he again brought them forward. All this time Miss Merryton stood motionless, her ripe lips practising kisses on the carved ivory handle of the most sylph like of all sylphide parasols, and her invincible black eyes fixed intently on her prisoner. Now then she saw, with that intuition with which a few of the masculine, and all the feminine conquerors of mankind are gifted, that the \" up Guards and at 'em,\" moment had arrived, and having devoted one single instant to the arrangement of"], [129, "117 VALETTA. the all conquering bonnet and the rich wave of hair which so perseveringly broke loose from beneath it ; she advanced boldly on the foe, and did not pause until a cloud of lace and barege and ambrosial silk rustled against the old flannel, and swept around the bewildered and beleaguered gentleman. \" And now,\" said she, \" you naughty, naughty, naughty man, is this the gallantry to the ladies which they were all praising so, after you were gone last night.\" Never was a shot more truly aimed. Crash went this speech through the Squire's obstinacy, and prejudice, and habit, and finally buried itself in his amour propre. People naturally enough value most the reputation of those good qualities which they are conscious of least deserving, and as we have seen, the old gentleman made it a point to be, in his old fashioned way, exceedingly polite to the ladies, having a shrewd suspicion that there was nothing lost by it. It is true the effort cost him but little,"], [130, "118 VALETTA. for, except on the occasion of his annual party at Miss Grantham's, he seldom came under the influence of the blandishments of the sex. \" They're an uncommon soft lot,\" said he, \" a little bit oi parley-wow and perlite ness goes pretty nigh as far as cash with 'em.\" This was the Squire's notion on the sub ject, and as politeness involved no immedi ate expense, he Avas always ready to dis pense it, and had indeed a sort of vague notion that he Avas gaining by it and taking somebody in. Whenever, as on the present occasion, anything occurred to confirm this belief he was well pleased. He accordingly thrust his hand to the bottom of his trowser pockets, rattled the bunch of keys and the feAV loose shillings which were endeavour ing to hide themselves from his grasp in those unfathomed recesses, and then burst into a long and hearty laugh. The Squire laughed perhaps once in a quarter of a year ; when he did so, it gene-"], [131, "119 VALETTA. rally came to pass that some one or other paid pretty heavily for his indulgence. As his mouth opened he exposed to view a set of long, irregular pointed teeth, Avhich lapped over each other like the tusks of a wild boar. \" Wery glad to see you mum,\" said he, \" sit down, oh dear ! poor Jacob ! You were too much for him \u2014 too much by half \u2014 you were indeed, mum \u2014 oh ! dear !\" And here the Squire again relapsed into a laugh at the defeat of his man, for in this light the matter presented itself to him, and continued his merriment until the tears ran clown his cheeks. \" Be seated mum, be seated, pray, oh dear ! . poor little Jacob.\" All this time Miss Merryton, without paying much attention to the Squire and his joke, had b,een examining his den. It Avas a little room full of nooks and angles, in every one of which was fitted in a little book case, filled with old periodicals, old reviews, old newspapers, all bound and"], [132, "120 VALETTA. lettered, and arranged in excellent chrono logical array. Then there were county histories, and chronicles, maps of the county, geological surveys of the county, plans of the parish, and over the mantelpiece a coloured plan of the Norley Court Estate, In a nook beside the little fireplace was a thermometer ; outside the window w7as another thermometer, and by the side of it a piece of sea weed, whose sensitive fabric served to indicate to the owner's experi enced eye approaching changes in the weather ; while behind the door again lurked an ill-looking barometer. In the centre of the room was an old black leather library table, on Avhich lay docketed together in the nicest array a collection of bills, notes, memoranda and legal forms. For the Squire was in the commission of the peace, though true to his maxim of minding his own affairs, he could seldom be got to act as a magistrate. On one side of the table was a huge, old-fashioned oak chair, lined with crimson"], [133, "VALETTA. 121 leather and studded with brass nails. This was known as the justice chair, and was never occupied, save when its owner was acting officially, or when he was giving au dience to tenants, receiving rents, or engaged in other solemn matters, and was especially desirous of inspiring reverence and awe. By the side of this throne was the little. low-seated, uncomfortable chair, in which he habitually sat to con over the old county records, examine the maps of the parish, set in order his accounts, and ar range those plans, whose results had pro cured for him the reputation of being the \" first man in those parts.\" \" Pray, sit down, mum,\" repeated the old gentleman. \" Pray, sit down \u2014 we shan't make no charge.\" This speech was one the choicest of his stock gallantries. The young lady looked leisurely around. On the seat of the justice chair lay spread out several specimens of sea-Aveed, vol. I.

Having turned these over curiously, with the tiny parasol with the pink silk fringe and lining \u2014 that parasol which we may here observe, was as inseparably connected Avith the idea of the lady, as was the sacred standard of victory, the El d'Alala, of the Moors, with the Emperor of Morocco \u2014 Miss Merryton, at length, with a charming little affectation of horror, jerked them away into various corners of the room, and threw herself back into the very justice chair itself. In every lawless career there is, or ought to be, a climax and culminating point, at Avhich the statue of the Commandatore speaks out, at which the blue fire flashes forth, and uncomfortable tight little green"], [135, "VALETTA, 123 imps appear and perform an admonitory dance \u2014 a point at which the thunders roll, the earth trembles, and mountains fall. This arrangement of things justice, that is, poetical justice, demands. Accordingly, it is to be met with in the works of the poets. Fortunately for the heroine of the pink bonnet, the retribution of real life is a slow and stumbling jade ; lumbering along with its pede claudo, very differently from the winged ambler of Parnassus. Had it been otherwise, something tremendous must certainly have happened when all the enor mities, of which she had been guilt}^ were crowned by this final one of seating herself, without a moment's hesitation or mis giving, in the very justice chair itself. However, nothing did happen. The fair culprit arranged her bonnet with the most charming insouciance, and appeared per fectly indifferent as to the issue of this strange adventure. The Squire rubbed his G 2"], [136, "124 VALETTA. hands, turned up the sleeves of his old jacket, turned them doAvn again, and, at length, seated himself in his little chair in such a Avay as to conceal, to the best of his poAver, that sad scantiness of his jacket which was so painfully present to his mind. After a moment's silence, he burst into another broad laugh. \"Oh, dear!\" said he, \"oh, dear! poor Jacob \u2014 poor, little Jacob ! You're too much for him, mum \u2014 you are indeed. Why, you're the first 'oman as has been in this room this ten year !\" What the Squire said Avas literally true. During ten years hers was the first skirt which had passed through the door of the little room, kept as sacred from the sex as a Turk's paradise. So much so, that, dur ing the whole of that period, such cleaning and putting to rights, as the Squire would condescend to submit to, had been per formed by Jacob under his own personal supervision."], [137, "125 VALETTA. \" The first 'oman these ten years,\" he repeated, after a moment's pause, as if loth to dismiss from his mind so agreeable a re miniscence. \" And no wonder,\" replied the young lady, tilting over a little array of docu ments on the table with the handle of her parasol ; \" no wonder. Who Avould ever think of coming into such a little, untidy, bachelor den 1\" \" Untidy, mum !\" exclaimed Joe. \" Certainly \u2014 untidy. Look at all these papers littered about,\" said she, tilting over another carefully arranged set of memo randa. \" You uncomfortable bachelor, you, I wonder you can venture to look a lady in the face !\" \" Well, I aint much given that way,\" murmured the old gentleman to himself, concealing a chuckle with his hand. \"Now don't be naughty,\" said Miss Merryton, shaking out her curls at him. \" Is not it very good of me to venture into this horrible little place . Don't speak \u2014 I hate comphments \u2014 and now to business.\""], [138, "126 VALETTA. As she said this, she suddenly turned round, and faced the Squire. At these magic Avords, the old gentleman squared himself in his chair, and passed his hand over his mouth to smother his sarcastic smile. \" Stop a bit, mum,\" said he, taking up a square carpenter's pencil from the table, and fumbling in his jacket pockets. After a prolonged search, he brought out a pair of silver-mounted glasses in a shagreen case. Having carefully wiped them on the sleeve of his jacket, he put them on. Then he produced a huge buck horn handled knife, with a sheath blade \u2014 with this he cut his pencil \u2014 and having placed before him a sheet of paper, and care fully arranged the shagreen case on one side of it, and the knife on the other, he next doubled up the paper, and endorsed it with the word \" Memorandum,\" and the date \u2014 and then having reopened it, and fixed his glasses afresh, he squared himself"], [139, "127 VALETTA. to his work, and clearing his throat, said, in a clear, sharp voice \u2014 \" Now, mum, you may go on.\" The young lady, however, remained silent, and the Squire, at length, stole a little, sharp look at her over the top of his glasses. She appeared to have entirely forgotten his presence, and to be mechanically en gaged in pluming her feathers, and arrang ing the most perfect of pink bonnets. \" Hum,\" said the Squire, in a tone suf ficiently loud and unmusical to have dis enchanted the sleeping princess in her en chanted wood. \" Heigho !\" sighed the lady, recovering from her reverie, and rising from her chair, \" I fear it is time to go.\" \" You were observing, mum,\" suggested Joe, still sitting staunchly before his sheet of paper, pencil in hand. \" You were ob- serving \u2014 \" \" Was I ? well, I forget all about it."], [140, "128 VALETTA.

After a moment, however, he paused, and burst into a long and hearty laugh. \"Oh dear! oh dear, mum!\" he ex claimed, at length, \" 1 beg your pardon."], [141, "129 VALETTA.

And, in another moment, the Squire was alone. He instantly drew f_om his pocket a folding horn comb, and passed it through his hair.

The old gentleman glanced his keen eyes at the lady and the bird. \" Ugh, a precious pair you'd make,\" thought he. But there was no indication of this relapse into his habitual tone of thought, unless it were a certain little im promptu swelling iu the centre of his cheek, Avhich looked very much as if the end of his tongue Avere making experi ments in that quarter. The young lady neither discerned nor cared to discern this.

The monster will tear it to pieces,\" cried the young lady, clasping her little primrose gloves together. She did not misjudge Quirk, who, having bounded, and rolled, and tumbled, two or three times round the chair in commemo ration of his having so uncommon an object submitted to the test of his des tructive poAvers, seized upon the parasol, and disappeared, at full speed, into the garden.

Perhaps Miss Merryton herself had some notion of the sort, for, as she examined Valetta, her face lengthened into an un usually serious expression.

He felt to his inmost marrow that the servant was fed with his food, lodged in his house, clothed Avith his clothes, and in addition, paid for receiving all these benefits, and he never could understand that any amount of service done, or to be done, could possibly constitute an adequate equivalent."], [155, "VALETTA. 143 Starting with this view, he soon came to consider domestics as a sort of privileged robbers, to whose impositions as to those of the rate-collector and tax-gatherer, it was necessary to submit, but at which it was nevertheless permitted to feel very sore. \" Odd rabbit um !\" he would say, \" im possible to get one's money's worth out of 'em !\" But money's worth he felt to be so great a good \u2014 next, indeed, in importance, to money itself, that he struggled long and hard to get as large au instalment of it as possible. This was to be effected by a two fold process. The first portion, which was ancillary, consisted in paring down the wages and restricting the dietary ; the latter, in increasing, as much as possible, the amount of labour to be done. \" Talk of hard work,\" cried Joe, as he imposed his tasks. \" Odd rabbit um, I could do twice as much myself!\" The English, of all classes, are matter-"], [156, "144 VALETTA. of-fact people ; possessing, among other estimable qualities, a strong turn for a bar gain with tAvo sides to it ; and, under the influence of their master's hard work, harder words, and hardest of all, his stiff puddings and sour beer, the Squire's ser vants soon began to shake their heads and repeat, often and loudly, that creed and watch Avord of their class, that \"service was no inheritance.\" Some complained that itwas impossible to keep their hands clean ; others, that it was impossible to keep the rambling old house clean ; some found it Avas impossible to stay athomeAvhen they discovered that itwasnext to impossible to get out ; some objected to a house iu which it wasimpossible to get a fin ger into an occasional pie dish, inasmuch as there were neither pies nor dishes ; some were afraid of ghosts ; others had a mor tal aversion to rats \u2014 and, the long and short of it all was, that, however homely their ideas, and however limited their am bition, all Avho came beneath the Squire's"], [157, "145 VALETTA. domestic rule, were suddenly seized with a violent desire to \" better themselves.\" \" Odd rabbit um ! let 'em go,\" growled the Squire. \" I could do the work a deal better myself.\" He found, however, that this was a mis take. Like other strong-minded people, he could just kick against the established order of things sufficiently hard to find that he was bound hand and foot. \" Never mind !\" said he, \" we'll see what we can do.\" This was the phrase writh which he was wont to usher in some grand stroke of his policy ; accordingly, after he had repeated it a sufficient number of times, he swooped down upon a village orphan, of a mind and a position so very humble, that she found this brick making wnthout straw to her taste, and revered her task master not only as the greatest, but as the wisest and best of all possible Egyptians. She toiled on from sunrise to sunset. No, VOL. I. H"], [158, "146 VALETTA. no \u2014 no phrase descriptive of the ordinary boundaries of labour, would have corres ponded to old Joe's notions of his \" money's worth.\" She toiled on from before sun rise to long after sunset. She ground down her hands and knees, but she never ground doAvn her spirit. Her body was an exceedingly humble casket, it is true, but it contained one of those Avayward, wonderful, feminine organi sations which, through good report, and evil report, through injury, injustice, and even through neglect, persist in clinging! with angelic pertinacity of faith, to the one chosen idea ; the one elected idol and heathenism of heart faith. The handmaid was determined to be lieve that this cursing, grumbling, exacting, sinful, old Joe, Avasa paragon. It was a strange phantasy, but she throve on it. She grew up to be a woman ; toiling on Avithout a single doubt ; and, at last, she became so useful, that the old gentleman"], [159, "VALETTA. 147 began to think seriously of reducing her wages. We all find our pleasure, our self awarded, or to speak more truly, our heaven-awarded recompense somewhere. This deplorable character found hers in her attachment to her master \u2014 to his old house\u2014 to his old furniture \u2014 the un wieldly grates, and chairs, and tables, with which her whole life was struggling ; to the gar den ; to the poultry ; to the very idea of the terrible and mysterious lady of Norley herself. Never was there such a master ; such an admirably monte establishment as that of Norley ! Nowhere did the sun shine so brightly as at Norley. No rats were ever so daring and so voracious as those of Norley. No cats so active and affaires as those of Norley. No clock ever chimed so solemnly as that of the village church ; and no ghost so awful ever responded to its chime as the ghost of the aforesaid terrible lady of Norley. H 3"], [160, "148 VALETTA. But above all did she attach herself to her master's daughter and ; deep and undy ing had been her sorrow for the never mentioned catastrophe of her 'misstress's fate. When the children had been brought home a new era in her life commenced. Could old Joe but have divined it, then would have been the glorious moment to have reduced her wages. From that day she would have slaved on for nothing ; from that day she required but enough health and strength to Avatch over the two little girls ; from that day she Avas nurse and mother, and all on six pounds a-year and her Avoman's heart. For years she continued supremely happy in what she belieA'ed to be the most envia ble of human lots. At length there came a trouble \u2014 for trouble will invade even such a fictitious, self-subsisting happiness as this of hers. The Squire took it into his head to make fine ladies of his daughters ; that is, he, after long demur and much delay, made"], [161, "VALETTA. 149 up his mind to have them taught reading, writing, and a few other necessary or, as he insisted, superfluous accomplish ments. A needy lady was accordingly evoked from the neighbouring town, who under took the war against the alphabet and the Squire's prejudices. Then there came the pangs of jealousy to poor Peggy. Many a time when she rose before the sun to her labours, she felt, as she wandered about peering into the \u2014 to her\u2014 inscruta ble mysteries of grammar, maps, spelling, and round text, that all this cabalistic lore was to separate her for ever from her children. \" It's a mighty odd thing,\" thought she, \" that they can't let folks bide.\" So thought the Squire, as he went wan dering about, with his hands in his pockets, deploring the advent of the governess. \" There's her wages \u2014 the interest of thirteen hundred and odd pound ; and then she eats, odd rabbit her ! as much as"], [162, "150 VALETTA. all the rest of the house put together, and must have her glass o' sherry wine into the bargain \u2014 oh, lor !

There '11 be a judgment on us \u2014 A tower of Babel, and land down at five shillings an acre \u2014 Oh, lor!\" Although this simple philosopher had, by long and patient study, arrived at these mature views on the subject of education, like all other true philosophers, he was tolerant in carrying them into execution. Indeed, he not only yielded so far to the prejudices of the vulgar as to employ a"], [163, "151 VALETTA. governess but submitted to her teachings without opposition, if not with the very best grace, until the arrival of that fatal day on which the music began. But no sooner was the one and \u2014 twoand \u2014 three and \u2014 four and, partof this accomplish ment fairly set in motion than his equani mity was at an end. In a fit of phrensy he burst into the school-room, roundly cursed the \" piany,\" and dismissed the governess out of hand. From that day forth there was no more teaching, so the two girls were launched into the intellectual ocean thus slenderly provided for the voyage. In the meantime, Peggy, half admiring, half mistrusting the effects of all this learn ing, was determined not to be left behind, and accordingly became a pupil of the children. Though not a very apt scholar she proved a Arery persevering one, so that by the time four years were over she had ad vanced into words of as many syllables, and"], [164, "152 VALETTA. might be found cleaning the grates of a morning with a column before her of such words as \" subaqueous,\" \" sublunary,\" \" subsidiary,\" not perhaps highly interest ing or suggestive to her imagination, but which she was breaking her heart to learn before bed-time, when she would be called upon to repeat it all to little Miss Rhoda. Both parties were satisfied ; we all like to trifle on the brink of terrible realities, and the little girl, who was delighted to play at governesses, obtained from her elder sister a sort of charter constituting her perpetual professor of polysyllables ; while Peggy, on her side, clambered desperately up the ladder of learning, mak ing no very perceptible progress, but quite convinced that she was iu some unknown manner to reap commensurate advantage from her labours. The nursery at Norley Court was a large, old-fashioned room, looking into the garden. The walls were panelled in oak like those of most of the other apartments in the"], [165, "VALETTA. 153 mansion, and the darkness occasioned by this was increased by a large cypress tree whose massive foliage waved immediately in front of the window. It being poor Peggy's birth-day, a secret and heretical fire was, by the young ladies' express desire, and on their personal responsibility and peril, languidly burning in the old-fashioned grate. Before it sat Peggy Franko ; she Avas a woman of about fifty years of age, with a large, bony frame, and a square, honest, ex pressionless face surmounted by a cap of strange design, beneath which struggled and fretted a shock head of sandy hair, parted carefully on one side. Her dress, which Avas of black silk, Avould have seemed but little in accordance with the manifold duties of her laborious office, had not a single glance been sufficient to sIioav that it was no habitual attire. As she sat there, constantly smoothing down her skirts, and arranging her sleeves, it h 5"], [166, "154 VALETTA. was evident that she was but little at ease in the magnificence of her birth-day suit, and mortally afraid lest some spot or stain, or crease, should render its next appear ance, which she purposed should be, please Heaven, on her next birth-day, one of diminished splendour. Wherever a petticoat rustles, the ameni ties of life are at hand. However matter of-fact they may be, or believe themselves to be, there is still a thread of romance woven in to the most homespun of their characters. These three females, the nurse and her two children, cut off from the rest of the world, and utterly ignorant of all that has been done among men, or dreamed by the poets, had, out of the fulness of their own hearts, devised a little tableau romanesque, in which they Avere all desperately inter ested. The two girls had established the custom of making their nurse a present on her"], [167, "155 VALETTA. birthday. Having neither market to go to, nor money to spend thereat \u2014 their annual offering consisted of a wreath of flowers, about Avhich they had been busily engaged all the morning. The weaving together of this wreath wTas always a grand mystery, and its presenta tion was supposed, in theory, to be quite unexpected by Peggy, and to take her en tirely by surprise, as a totally unlooked-for and improbable event. It was for this surprise that she Avas now waiting, jerking herself about a prey to all the nervous anxiety of suspense. On the mornings of these birth-days, her first fear wras that her children might altogether forget her, or that they might think it time to discontinue their childish habit. As the evening came, after she had as certained, by many secret peepings, that the wreath Avas in preparation, she was all fear that something might occur to hinder them from presenting it, or that the Squire"], [168, "156 VALETTA. might see the flowers, and think them too good to be wasted on \" the likes\" of her, or, in short, a score of those disagreeable contingencies which spring up too readily in the minds of the expectant. \" Heigho !\" sighed she, as the shadows stole over the room, and the flickering fire alone lighted it, \" I wish the little dears hadn't put in that warigated sage.\" In the mean time, the conspirators had been consulting outside in the passage in delighted embarrassment as to the mode and moment of presentation. Rhoda, who never let slip an occasion of writing, folding up, sealing, and directing a letter, proposed that a note should be sent through Jacob, presenting the Misses Melville's compliments to Mrs. P. Franko, and requesting to knovv when it would be convenient for her to see them on particu lar business ; but Valetta, who held the wreath in her hands, declaring it impossi ble to wait any longer, cut short the argu ments in favour of this reasonable"], [169, "VALETTA. 157 proposition, by bursting boldly into the room. In a moment, she thrust the wreath over Peggy's cap, to the eternal ruin of the decorative portions of that structure \u2014 threw her arms round her neck \u2014 kissed her \u2014 wished her many happy returns of the day, and then retreating a few paces, clapped her hands together, and crying, \" capital 1\" burst into a peal of laughter, which went on crescendo, until it ended in a cry, which ended in a laugh again, and another hearty embrace. Rhoda, in the next instant, went through the same heartv ceremonv, aud having thrown in a few grave sentences, appro priate to, and suggested by the occasion, she began laughing in concert Avith her sister. Teggy certainly presented a sufficiently grotesque appearance, with her great, clumsy hands, smoothing down her silk dress, her cap on one side, her hah escap-"], [170, "158 VALETTA. ing on the other, and the flowers on the top of all. Suddenly Rhoda ceased laughing, and fixing her large, grave eyes on Peggy, took her sister by the arm. \" Look,\" she whispered, \" she is crying.\" In effect, two great tears were roiling down Peggy's cheeks. Valetta instantly flew upon her, threw her arms round her neck, and effectually concealed her face from view. When the party Avere somewhat restored to order, they sat down to indulge in the true feminine luxury of talking the matter over ; and Avhen they had viewed it in all its possible phases, and each had explained her impressions, at length, Peggy, after some little hesitation, proposed, Avith a solemn air, to relate the often-told tale of the Lady of Norley. \" I Avould rather hear ' Finetta,' or tbe ' Discreet Princes's,' \" said Rhoda. \" Let her, dear,\" whispered Valetta ; \" it is her birth-day.\""], [171, "VALETTA. 159 And so they stirred the fire until it blazed merrily \u2014 and having cast their eyes round on the flickering light \u2014 on the time stained oak panels \u2014 and having given a suspicious glance at the old cypress tree, which waved mournfully to and fro in the dark night without, they, with a delicious shiver, dreAv themselves round, fully pre pared to be horrified. Peggy began her discourse, like Tris megistus of old, with the \" verum certe verum atque verissimum est.\" \" Once upon a time,\" said she, \" there was a king, who \u2014 \" \"Stop!\" exclaimed Valetta, \"Quirk is not here ;\" and she bounded from the room. Presently she returned, bearing in her arms the defaulter, who, the moment he was set down, commenced a sham attack on his mistress, running round her, dodg ing behind her chair, and making tremen dous snaps at the air."], [172, "160 VALETTA. Valetta, with peals of mirth, chased him round and round, and having, at last. hemmed him into a corner, she took him prisoner ; inflicted a pretended and pro forma punishment, and placed him down in front of the fire, in the centre of the party, Avhere, having in vain endeavoured to arouse his mother, who was stretched asleep, by biting her ears, he seated himself Avith great solemnity, and stared Peggy full in the face as she proceeded with her story. \" Once upon a time,\" said she, shutting her eyes, and assuming a sing-song tone, \" there was a king, who\u2014 lived in this very house \u2014 \" It is unnecessary to follow Peggy through her story, which, perhaps, none of her auditors did, unless it were Quirk, whose attention appeared never to flag during its progress. Suffice it to say, that this king, like other kings, had a lovely daughter, who, like other lovely daughters fell in love with a fascinating young"], [173, "VALETTA. 161 hero, who, like other fascinating young heroes, had not a doit to bless himself withal. The youth, so ran the legend, having proposed in form to the papa, was questioned as to his prospects, and replied that he would carve a way to fortune with his sword. The prudent father, who was of opinion that the carving should com mence immediately after marriage, and should be directed to the substantial, domestic divinities of beef and pudding, was, by no means, satisfied with this figure of speech, and forbade his house and royal presence to the young hero. In spite of this, hoAvever, he shortly afterwards dis covered him attempting a clandestine interview with his lovely daughter. There upon, the prudential wrath of paternity being aroused, he sent him off to the Avars, where, from the carver, he became the carvee, being slain in a skirmish, in which he had greatly distinguished himself. He was tucked up in the bed of glory and"], [174, "162 VALETTA. there was an end of him, and his pre tensions. So at least thought the royal father, and he congratulated himself there upon, feeling that he was a very prudent fellow ; but the daughter, feeling that her happiness was gone, and being determined to follow it, fell ill and died. The justice of benign tradition had decreed that so much love could not rest so near to the scenes of its joys and sorrows, Avithout, at times, re- visiting them ; accordingly, it had been established as a matter of popular credence, that the lady of Norley, at certain unascertained in tervals, or evoked by certain events in the family of the descendents of her race, would rise from the churchyard, and walk o'nights in the hall of the old mansion. A terrible visitation this, and one far from being duly appreciated in this sad generation of lecture-boards, and serials. \"And' does the ghost ever come now V"], [175, "163 VALETTA. said Valetta, as the girls exchanged an arch- glance. \" Not in Mr. Hardyman's time, my dears,\" said Peggy, sinking her voice into a solemn whisper ; \" but in the time of his father, they do say, that one night, as the old gentleman was crossing the hall just as the clock struck twelve, he suddenly heard a knock three times, and theu there was a bright light in the hall, and \u2014 \" At this moment, as Peggy paused in the solemnity of her narrative, there came a loud startling- knock at the nursery door. \" Heaven preserve us !\" cried she, ex tending her arms to the girls. Valetta turned pale, stood up, sat down again, and plasped her little hands firmly together. Quirk gave a sharp, single bark, and hid himself behind his mistress's dress. Rhoda fixed her large blue eyes on the door, and said, in a faltering voice, \" Come in.\""], [176, "164 VALETTA. \"Jacob!\" exclaimed all three as the door opened, and the consequential little figure of the man paused on the threshold. \" We took you for a ghost, Jacob,\" ex claimed Valetta, indemnifying herself, for her fright, by giving way to a most merry and most musical laugh. Now Jacob Nvas one of the new school \u2014 a man of the world, and a reader of information for the people ; therefore, when he heard this speech, he cleared his throat conscientiously, and said, \" Ask your pardon, miss \u2014 There are no such things as ghosts.\" \" Listen to him \u2014 only listen to him ! That man believes in nothing,\" said Peggy, with a mournful voice, shutting her eyes, and rocking her body to and fro. \" I ask your pardon, Mrs. Franko,\" said Jacob, in that mild forbearing tone of superior wisdom, more irritating than the most intemperate haste."], [177, "VALETTA. 165 \" What do you believe in .\" cried Peggy, at once losing her self-command, and starting up. Jacob closed the door, and advancing into the middle of the room, placed his left hand on the back of a chair. Then having drawn his right across his mouth in imitation of his master, he raised it into the air, and said, in a declamatory tone \" I believe, with the young ladies' per mission, in edication \u2014 in progress \u2014 in rail roads \u2014 in the use of the globes \u2014 in the social scale \u2014 the funds \u2014 and \u2014 and in short, in all that 'ere ; and that's wdiat I believe in, Mrs. Franko.

They at once, therefore, boldly sided with her. \" You believe in nothing, Jacob,\" said Rhoda, fixing her large eyes on him. \" You are an infidel, Jacob,\"\" laughed Valetta. \"lama man of progress,\" staunchly per sisted this second Pal\u00e6phatus, this disen chanter and explainer away of the legends of the past."], [179, "167 VALETTA. \" But you won't listen to reason, Jacob,\" began Rhoda. \" Bite him, Quirk; bite him,\" cried Valetta, clapping her bands and pointing at the philosopher. Up bounded the dog to take his part in the controversy, delighted at the summons to mischief ; bounding, barking, and mak ing ferocious snaps at the air, at a safe dis tance from the little legs of the unpopular Jacob, of whom he stood in wholesome awe. Valetta seized a skipping-rope ; Rhoda deliberately armed herself Avith a broom ; and she man of progress having, like others who are fools enough to be too wise, in vain endeavoured to obtain a hearing, fairly turned tail ; and, amidst barking, and shouts of laughter, the throwing of the lasso, and chargings of brooms, fled from the nursery, that last stronghold of the credences of other days.

It is a good place to tell the tale this. But there is still a better. Let us pass out into the garden.

Here lie buried Alary, the wife of J. Hardyman, Esq., and Mary Melville, daughter of the same : the former of whom, as the moonlight which falls brightly ou the stone, will enable us to decipher, was a dutiful wife and died deeply regretted, in the forty-fifth year of her age ; the latter, an affectionate daughter, who departed this life, some eight years later, in the thirty third year of her age. To go back to the first act of the drama, of which this carved stone was the natural denouement. When Mr. Hardyman had attained the age of thirty-five, it had seemed good unto him to take to himself a wife ; or to speak more exactly, it had not so much seemed good unto him, as necessary for the per petuation of his race and the preservation of his estates. He was not a man to repine. He took I 5"], [190, "178 VALETTA. things as he found them, and made the best of them. When, therefore, he had made up his mind that a wife was one of the evils necessarily incidental to his posi tion, he set to work to mitigate the cala mity by selecting one as little objection able as might be. Having reduced his ideas into writing, he came to the conclusion that if he could find a woman who, in addition to youth and good looks, an amiable, docile, and sub missive temper, Avas possessed of a certain amount of property he would marry her. With these modest views he started forth on a little voyage of discovery through the County drawing-rooms. It is hardly necessary in these enlight ened days to observe that by the laws of social attraction a large lump of money necessarily draws to it a smaller one. Ac cordingly before long a frolicsome, happy little maid of twenty, with nothing to weigh herdoAvnbut the guineas inherpockets, found"], [191, "179 VALETTA. herself, thanks to the kind offices of her family, gravitating irresistibly towards the rich Squire. It is hardly necessary to add that when the said Squire had taken home his wife, he proceeded forthwith to make the best of a bad bargain, by putting out her monies to very advantageous uses, and by com mencing his task of breaking her in. This self-imposed duty continued until the merry voice sank into a whisper, and the bounding step Avas hushed into silent and stealthy paces. It continued still further \u2014 until the cheek faded, and the eye waxed dim, and the step feeble \u2014 but all this time no tears Avere seen \u2014 there was no word of remon strance \u2014 no hint of anything but the most perfect satisfaction and contentment. Such was the course of proceedings at the Court ; since the second stone of Norley was placed upon the first, the wife of a Hardyman had never had a will of her own. There was something about the"], [192, "180 VALETTA. nature of the men against which no femi nine resistance could prevail. In the first year of the marriage a daughter had been born. Perhaps the Eileithyi\u00e6, those special goddesses of parturition, had not so early discovered the sort of husband they had to deal with. Ever afterwards, however, they refused to entrust to him the responsibilities of paternity. This one little girl accordingly grew up the representative of all the Hardymans. When the Squire found that such was the case he felt that he had been imposed on in his marriage, which had been contracted Avith the express intention of having two healthy sons. A Hardyman to be taken in \u2014 and by a woman ! The breaking in Avent on more system aticallythan ever,and was in process of time extended to the daughter ; nevertheless she grew up to be a woman. As a neces sary corollary and consequence, she grew up to fall in love, and make herself miser-"], [193, "181 VALETTA. able or happy \u2014 according as you may please to view it. A lieutenant of infantry quartered in the neighbourhood who was well connected (as the phrase runs,) played admirably on the flute, and had not sufficient money to purchase himself a company, was the object of her dream \u2014 For dream anyone who knew Joe Hardyman, would have pro nounced it to be. And a very wild and disordered dream too. \" Not so,\" thought the lady, and she was a Hardyman, with a Hardyman's determi nation. \" Not so,\" thought the poor lieutenant who loved her. They were secretly married. The result was what might have been expected \u2014 children, a couple of daughters \u2014 straightened circumstances \u2014 and an abso lute refusal of the old man to see or hear of them. As to doing anything for them, that, of course, Avas out of the question. With such elements in the plot the"], [194, "182 VALETTA. denouement soon came on. The regiment removed to Malta. The flute and the climate killed the husband. The widow returned with the children. She died in a little lodging in Benchurch, dependent for daily bread on the benevolence of Miss Grantham. The old man never forgot this as he rattled his backgammon box, and won the old spinster's sixpences. The honour of a burial at Norley Avas accorded by the Squire, who now appeared, and took the children home. It would have been a comfort to his wife to have had the children with her ; but she also Avas dead. Perhaps that was the reason he was appeased. She had her own child with her instead. They lay side by side in the new grave made by the Squire \u2014 for in Hardyman vault he had sworn they never should sleep. Well! they sleep soundly enough where they are. They miss not the rotting pomps of your mouldy heraldry, Squire. The weary ones are at rest."], [195, "183 VALETTA. The moon shines its sweetest on the spot where lies what was mortal in the beauty of those gentle, loving women. Their souls, wre may dare to hope, have gone up into Heaven, to take their appointed places there. i How many thousands like them \u2014 even noAV tottering under the load of ingratitude \u2014 of falsehood, and unkind yoke-fellows, are wearing out that weary path which leads them on to the same bright recom pense above. But let us return to the old Squire, who smacks more of the day, and less of the churchyard than these reflections. Late that evening, after the young ladies had retired for the night, and every thing in the house Avas hushed, Mr, Hardy man Avas sitting alone in his study. Upon the table was a single candle of the commonest description, Avhich threw a faint and indistinct light over the old book shelves, the parish map, and the barome ters."], [196, "184 VALETTA. The fire was dying away in the narroAV grate. \" Fire light, and candle light at the same time would bring any man to the Avork-house !\" was the declaration of Mr. Hardyman ; and, while he endeavoured to enforce the rule in his house, he, unlike many other reformers, rigidly adhered to it himself. The old gentleman invested in his flannel jacket, with his carpenter's pencil in his left hand, was bending over a sheet of paper on Avhich from time to time he jotted down a few straggling figures. At length his calculations were at an end. He pushed the paper impatiently aside, and taking < ff his glasses wiped them, put them up, and threAv himself back in his chair. \" Too bad, a deal too bad,\" said he, at length. \" The Avoman's made a fortune out of me.\" The cause of the Squire's uneasiness Avas this : He had established six pounds a-year as the Avages forming an equivalent for Mrs. Franko's services, but as the day of half yearly"], [197, "185 VALETTA. payment came round, and with it the pain ful duty of paying forth his money, he had been in the habit of speaking in this fashion \u2014 \" Peg, be a wise girl \u2014 don't spend all your money at once. Put it by, lass, put it by \u2014 A rainy day '11 come afore long \u2014 Put it by, lass.\" The consequence was that Peggy actually received two pounds a-year, Avhile the remaining four pounds were added to an accumulating fund. The woman was well satisfied because she was acting in conformity with the Squire's advice, and the Squire was a wise man, an omnipotent man in fact, who had made a power of money. She, therefore, was accustomed to take her two pounds a-year, and cut and contrive as well as she could Avith them, never troubling herself about the remainder. The Squire was well satisfied because, as he declared over and over again to himself, he was doing the best for his faithful servant by considerately"], [198, "186 VALETTA. allowing the money to remain in his pocket. Nevertheless, whenever he thought over the subject, as he did at periodical intervals of which the present epoch of payment was one, the increasing amount of her savings caused him a pang. \" Thirty year, come Christmas \u2014 One hundred and twenty pound. (Interest of course was out of the question). Ugh ! It's a precious site of money. Too bad, 'od rabbit um.

This evening, however, he had been beguiled into unwonted extravagance by his anxious reflections on the morrow, and by the calculations suggested to him by the birth-day of the faithful Peggy."], [200, "188 VALETTA. He now pulled a huge, old silver hunt ing watch from his pocket, and found to his surprise that it wanted but a few minutes of midnight. The weaknesses of the great are the best apology they can offer to common men for their superiority. The Squire had his weaknesses ; one of them, which he shared in common with not a few distinguished characters, was the artificial necessity of taking a stiff glass of grog immediately before retiring for the night. All indulgence leads to expense, because it leads to another indulgence. The Squire therefore was ashamed of a weakness which ran counter to all his principles, and being unable to overcome it, had the decency to indulge in it secretly.

All was still, save the clock, which ticked loudly in the old hall, and the old elms without, which rustled and murmured faintly in the night breeze. Presently a distant door opened, and the sound of revelry smote upon the listener's ear. He instantly drew his head back again \u2014 hastily closed his door \u2014 and threw himself into a chair.

Again he was silent, and he paused to listen. At this moment, the hall clock gave a low premonitory whirr, and struck the midnight hour. Hark ! There ! What is that noise without ? The sharp sound is echoed back by the deep answering chime from the old crazy belfry of the church tower outside. \" Eh ! Avhat's that .

There was a moment's pause. \" The Lord have mercy upon us,\" groaned the old man, staggering back against the wall, and dropping his candle. As he spoke, a something \u2014 a figure, yet undefined in form \u2014 a something \u2014 a death sheet from the neighbouring graves \u2014 an unknown, unrecognizable horror glided slowly and silently by, almost brushing the old man as it passed. But he saw no more. His candle expired on the floor, and as it did so, he closed his eyes. He had not remained long in this con dition, when he was aroused by a sound, of all others the one best calculated to restore him to consciousness \u2014 a loud cry from the hall ; a heavy fall ; and the breaking of glass. He raised himself slowly, and with dif ficulty, and having groped about for his candle, quietly regained his room, and carefully closed the door after him. \u2022' Let us pray,\" said he, bowing to an"], [204, "192 VALETTA. imaginary congregation. \" The Lord have mercy on us, miserable sinners. Amen. 1 have seen it, at last \u2014 I knowed I should some day or other.\" But now the confusion in the hall in creased, and there was the sound of sevei al voices raised in loud and anxious inquiry. The old man at once struck a light, and hastened out. In the middle of the hall was congre gated a little knot, composed of Peggy, the occasional charwoman, and three or four villagers, the guests of the evening. In the centre, lay Jacob on the floor, sur rounded by fragments of broken glass and crockery, lumps of sugar, teaspoons, and a steaming pool, Avhich gave forth decidedly alcoholic revelations. To their repeated questions, the prostrate disciple of progress would only reply, with out taking his hands from before his eyes. \" I have seen it \u2014 oh, dear ! I have seen it!\""], [205, "193 VALETTA. \" Seen what . But what have you seen V \"Nothing.

Off with you. Pack ! You to your beds ; and you to your homes.\" The group Avavered, but still remained. There are moments when a flock of sheep will make head ; and these good folks had caught wind of some very rich pasturage for their curiosity. \" Don't stand there. Off! What do you here at all ? You've no right in my house. I'll indict you all \u2014 by the Lord, 1 will.

He then drew another for himself close op posite to him, and seating himself, with his arms squared upon his knees, he fixed his sharp, grey eyes eagerly on his face. \" Well V said be, at length, \" well f Jacob coughed, and looked nervously at the door. The Squire got up \u2014 listened \u2014 looked into the passage \u2014 closed it carefully again \u2014 locked it \u2014 and resumed his seat opposite his man. \" Well V said he, again. \" I have seen it, at last,\" faltered the latter. \"What r \"The Lady of Norley!\" replied the other, sinking his voice into a whisper.

Well, sir, I did not hurry about your tray, be cause I knew you would ring when you wanted it. However, time slipped on, until, at last, some one looked at his watch, and said \u2014 \" ' Your master's up late to-night. It's five minutes to twelve.' \" Upon this I got up, and prepared the tray ; I was just crossing the hall with it, when the clock struck twelve. I fancied that there was something odd in the sound.

Jacob, still bearing the lantern, was about to take himself off trembling to his own quarters, when the old gentleman, thrusting his head out again from his bed room, cried \u2014 \" Stop, Jacob.\" The man returned with alacrity, for he had no great relish for his solitary walk through the house. \" Jacob, I've been a thinking.

The agriculturists, beginning from Cain, the first who followed the profession, have been a tribe somewhat dissatisfied at the manner in which the sun shines, the winds blow, the rain falls, and the general order of nature is conducted.

Valetta and Quirk were beside them selves with delight. Never was there such a racing, barking, snapping, and trying on of bonnets \u2014 Rhoda was discreetly happy. Juno, disturbed from her before breakfast nap, got up, shook her sides, walked twice deliberately round the room, and then lying down, closed her eyes in mute disapproval of the proceedings.

But, presently slipp;ng away to the window, began to won der if it would rain. \" Ah, ah !

As it was, however, to show his martial propensities, he gave a sharp, short bark, as if ordering himself to present arms ; and then, with three ferocious snaps at the air, he made a rush at the unfortunate Juno as she lay on the hearth, and seized her by the ear with such vigour, that he was obliged to be immediately taken up in the arms of his mistress to escape from the effects of the old dog's justly aroused indignation. Ten o clock sounded and down tripped the two girls.

The labours of Peggy had been light, for the toilette of the heiresses was simple in the extreme ; nevertheless, it was emi nently successful. The elder sister was dressed in a pink print dress (rest, oh! shade of Jacquard) and a straw bonnet with blue ribbons. Nothing very wonderful there, you would say. And so in fact did say several ladies at a subsequent period of the day; and so say thousands of young ladies every day as they endeavour to account to them selves, and each other, for the attention excited by some dear friend with her simple robe and staid manners.

Presently the study door opened, and out came the Squire, looking very clean about the face, and rather out of temper.

The old gentleman having returned their salutations, and accepted their thanks with a certain brevity, gazed keenly at them for a moment from beneath his shagged brows, and drew his hand across his lips to mask the smile which the inspection called forth. \" Well, gals,\" said he presently, rubbing his hands, and then thrusting them to the bottom of his pockets. \" All agog to go a-pleasuring, eh?\" Valetta unable to say \"no,\" and unwilling to say \"yes,\" turned up her face to him with one of her little mutinous looks, and burst into a merry laugh. \" Will you be so good as to tell them not to shoot much, grandpapa,\" said Rhoda, who in common with the rest of the house hold believed that Mr. Hardyman could, by holding up his finger, instantly put a stop to a general engagement, or do anything in the world to which he might find himself disposed. At this moment Jacob in a full dress"], [226, "214 VALETTA. suit of sober brown, over which was a dis carded blue great coat of his master, far too large for him, crossed the hall, and ap proaching the Squire, requested a few moments' interview with him. \" Run, gals, and see if the carriage is ready,\" said the old gentleman, and then he turned to his man. Jacob saluted. \" Hum,\" said the Squire. \" Hum,\" said Jacob, preparing for an oration. \" Wants his Avages raised, I'll lay a farden.\" thought the Squire. \" I believe, sir,\" said Jacob, extricating his right hand from the sleeve of his coat, and stroking his face with it. I believe, sir, I've always given satisfaction.\" \" Hem 1\" said the Squire, ominously. \" I've served you long and faithfully.\" \" And at good board, and wery high Avages,\" interposed the master. \" I don't complain of that,\" said Jacob."], [227, "VALETTA. 215 \" Ah ! wery good !\" ejaculated the Squire, brightening up ; \" wery good !\" \" Least wise not now, sir.\" \" Humph !\" \"Well, sir, Avhat I wanted just to say, was, that in consequence of what happened last night, and as there seem to be so many people to please in this house, it becomes every day more difficult to give satisfaction, and so I'd better go at once.\" \" Well,\" replied the master, \" you know your own affairs best. Of course I'm sorry to part with an old and valuable \u2014 that is to say I mean a valued servant, who has been with me so long, and at such wery good wages too, as I said just now; but if you must go, you must, and there's an end of it.\" Jacob bowed, the Squire nodded, and the pair having, by this little farce, which was not of uncommon occurrence between them, relieved themselves of the spice of ill humour, consequent upon being put out of"], [228, "216 VALETTA. their usual routine, they set to work to make the best of their expedition. In the mean time a rare event had taken place: the carriage had drawn up to the door, and was subjected to the wondering and whispered comments of the sisters. It was a ponderous, clumsy, old yellow landau with black wheels and drab lining ; on the centre of its pannels was the coarse daub of paint which had been applied to blot out the family arms when the tax gather had hinted at duties on armorial bearings. \" I'm not the man to be druv to the work'us for the sake of a tom-fooling pic ture, which is neither ox nor ass, nor horse, nor any beast as was ever bred in these parts, or any other, I expect.\" Thus had exclaimed the degenerate Joe ; and from that time forth his cypher, sur rounded by a wreath bearing the motto \" Persia atque obdura \", had alone ap peared on his panels. To this quaint old equipage were har-"], [229, "217 VALETTA. nessed a couple of clumsy, bay, cart mares; on the box, grasping the reins in his great, ungloved hands, sat the rustic who usually followed them at the plough tail. He had donned his Sunday hat for the occasion, and had been invested by the Squire in an old drab great coat, which had a faint re semblance to livery. Round his legs he had wrapped a horse-cloth to conceal his hob-nailed boots and fustian gaiters, which he seemed instinctively to feel were not in harmony with the occasion. Out came the Squire, and stood for a moment at the door, casting a scrutinizing gaze over the equipage. \" Have you got the nose-bags, Tom,\" holloed he, to the driver. \" All right, yer honour,\" replied the man, touching his hat. \" Well, gals,\" said the old gentleman, stroking down his face, \" what do you think of it?\" \" Beautiful !\" murmured Valetta, with VOL. 1. L"], [230, "218 VALETTA. intense enthusiasm. \" It is so very, very kind of you, dear grandpapa, to take us.\" And there she paused, and entered into a little whispered consultation with Rhoda, Avho, after a moment's consideration, nodded her head, and said, aloud \u2014 \" Yes, dear, I think so.\" \" Do you think, dear grandpapa, that there Avould be any objection to taking Quirk?\" suggested Valetta, in hesitating tones. \"Oh, aye! that's it, is it?\" said the old gentleman, who had been peeping at them out of the corner of his eye Avith his hand firmly fixed over his mouth, \" I thought there was something up. No, no! He'll go and spoil the linings of the carriage with his biting and scratching.\" \" No, grandpapa dear, indeed he shan't. I'll keep him in my lap the whole time.\" \" Well, if you'll promise that I don't so wery much mind it.\" Off flew Valetta, and speedily there was"], [231, "219 VALETTA. a laughing and racing \u2014 in short a grand chase after Quirk, who the moment he suspected that he was wanted started off at full speed, rolling, tumbling, lying still, and suddenly starting off again up stairs, down stairs, peeping over banisters, and darting into every corner of the house. At length, finding that the chase was on the point of being abandoned, he quietly per mitted himself to be caught, and presently Valetta re-appeared, a long mesh of bright hair escaping over her face, and all smiles, blushes and apologies, bearing her struggling favourite in her arms. The old gentleman looked at her for a moment \" Hum !\" said he, to himself, as he turned away to examine the knees of one of the horses, \" that gal is her mother over again \u2014 every inch of it\" \" Would not you like to have the head of the carriage up, grandpapa?\" said Rhoda; \" you may find it cold.\" L 2"], [232, "220 VALETTA. \"All, that little un's me \u2014 Just what I was at her age!\" said the old man, rubbing his hands with exquisite self-complacency. \" Well,\" continued he, aloud, \" that's not a bad idea, gal. Suppose, Jacob, you just \u2014 No, no, I don't know though; it's un common trying to the springs. Here, Jacob !\" The Squire Avhispered in the ear of his man, who disappeared for a moment and then returned with a brown silk night cap which the master drew on under his hat, and then gave the word to depart. \" Now we are going to start,\" whispered the girls, exchanging a happy glance, Rhoda holding on at the side. Jacob gave one fond look at the old rattle trap, touched his hat, and clambered into the rumble with an air of other days, shouting \u2014 \" All right!\" \"Gyp!\" cried the coachman, \"gyp! Lady-bird, gyp, lass!\" and his whip whistled about the ears of his cattle. The horses moved into a Avalk."], [233, "221 VALETTA. \"Gyp! lasses,\" cried the driver, and again the whip whistled. They broke into a slow trot. Old Joe threw himself back, and masked a smile. '' Now we're off,\" cried the girls, waving their handkerchiefs at an upper window, against which, in accordance with an elaborately planned scheme, Peggy was wistfully flattening her nose. Poor Peggy ! After she had watched them to the turn of the road, and enjoyed the last lingering instalment of pleasure as the wheels of the carriage, for a moment, became visible, she turned away with a heavy sigh. Every new interest and at traction, which her children found in the external world, was a tendril cast abroad, which she would fain have had twine itself round her own heart. \"Well! \u2014 well!\" said she, \" we ail likes our pleasure f and with this reflexion, she doubled down a new column of spelling,"], [234, "222 VALETTA. Avhich it was her task to overcome before the return of the inexorable Rhoda. Nevertheless, the woman had her plea sure. Her conduct Avas suggested by her heart, and the sensation which it awakened in her heart was its recompense. The sentiment of the Lady Douglass, in the play, was at the root of her philosophy. \"Believe me, sir, The truly generous is the truly wise , And he who loves not others, lives unblessed.

The old landau with its precious freight dawdled on until it at last arrived at tbe brow of tbe hill, from whence the long, low line of red-brick buildings, which formed the barrack square, became visible. At this point, the party caught sound of the loud blast of the bugles borne along on the winds, giving evidence that the day's spectacle was commencing. The sisters were seized with a panic, and"], [236, "224 VALETTA. prophesied to each other that all would be over before they could arrive. At length, however, the last half-mile Avas accomplished. They passed along with beating hearts under the Avails, from the other side of Avhich the clang of arms, the shouts of command, and the tramp of men, .vere audible. They pressed through the ragged crowd at the gate \u2014 passed the stiff sentry \u2014 and then the two girls, to whom a single stray soldier strolling through their remote village was an object of wonder and speculation, found themselves in presence of a Avhole regiment of armed men. The Squire, who, however much averse he might have, in the first instance, been to coming, had no idea of expending one shilling and a penny half-penny in tolls without an adequate equivalent, at once took up a position in the part of the ground reserved for the evolutions, from Avhich he Avas, with difficulty, and not without the exchange of a sharp volley of oaths, re-"], [237, "225 VALETTA. moved by the corporal on gate duty. How ever, after ' cussing and rabbiting um all' for a sufficient time, he condescended to retire into the rank of carriages, where he took his place between an elegant barouche on the one hand, and a mail phaeton on the other. \" Hope I see you well, mum,\" bawled the Squire to an elegant creature, who started up fro.n her recumbent position, in the barouche, as the Squire's huge machine came lumbering in, almost grazing the wheels of her fairy car. The elegant creature had an exquisite pink and white complexion, which a very thick, richly worked black lace veil guarded from the too curious scrutiny of the profane public eye. She had aa exquisite little waist, and exquisite little lavender kid gloves \u2014 -an exquisitely ugly little terrier, from beyond th. Forth, on the seat by her side \u2014and on the seat opposite to her, an exqui sitely got up little boy, with little bare dang- L 5"], [238, "226 VALETTA. ling, cold-looking legs, and long flaxen ringlets. The elegant creature, relieved from her momentary terror, gracefully acknowledged the Squire's salutation, and then threw herself languidly back among her cushions. Her little boy, avIio seemed very much afraid of his ringlets, and his fine clothes, and somewhat afraid of his elegant com panion, threw a single glance at Rhoda and Valetta, as if to ascertain if there Avere any chance of a romp in that quarter, and then, placing his hands one over the other, regarded his mama with rigid propriety of demeanour. Miss Rhoda returned his look with sym pathy, but with an evident sense of Avhat she owed to herself. Her sister at once formed and expressed, in a whisper, a violent desire to nurse the dear little fellow. In the meantime the elegantly-wigged coachman had scanned with inexpressible disgust the Squire's horses and their"], [239, "227 VALETTA. driver. The powdered footman had ex changed a look of mute defiance with Jacob; and Quirk and the northern dog had glared at each other much as Percy and Hotspur may be supposed to have done before the combat in which the honour of their respective countries was at stake. The mail phaeton which was on the other side of the Squire's carriage, and to which were harnessed a couple of clever, deep chested, dock-tailed trotters, was the pro perty of Mr. Felix Oxton. It was not merely his property; it was his pastime, his hobby, the subject of his thoughts by day, of his dreams by night. It was his passion. The turn-out flattered his vanity. There was nothing quite like it in the county; people admired it and him as its possessor. Quite enough, that, to account for and satisfy deeper passions than Mr. Oxton felt for his phaeton. The young gentleman's heart beat high, and his cheek flushed, as he found himself so close to the Norley Court family ark, for"], [240, "228 VALETTA. he felt as he sat there propped up on a pile of cushions, in his knowing coat and his plaid shawl, with the knowing horse shoe pin, and his knowing white hat and his ribands artistically gathered up between the fingers of his white buckskin gloves, that he could not possibly have been seen to better advantage. Therefore having exchanged a good morning, and a prophecy on the weather, with the Squire, he, not without confusion, raised his hat to Valetta, and feeliug that the best genius is that which best turns occasion to account, and being determined to make the most of his fortunate oppor tunity, he put it on again very much on one side, and drawing forth some cigars of a justly celebrated brand, proceeded to puff away stoutly and in silence. Presently it was announced that the in specting officer had arrived on the ground, and that the proceedings of the day were about to commence. Valetta raised herself with flashing eyes."], [241, "229 VALETTA. Rhoda took the opportunity to place her hands over her ears. \"I say, Tom,\" cried Mr. Hardyman, \" will the 'orses stand quiet at the fir- ing.\" Mr. Oxton and the wigged coachman cast glances at the Squire's beasts, which had dropped into a doze, after the unwonted labours of the morning. \"Oh! yes sir,\" replied Tom. \" They'ze be quiet enough, I reckon.\" \"Well then,\" cried the Squire, just slip on the nose-bags. \"And Jacob, hulloa! there! Jacob,,let's have lunch.\" All the glances from the neighbouring carriages were turned upon the Squire, especially those of the little boy, and the Scotch dog who gazed wistfully at a brown paper parcel handed down by Jacob. The Squire either unconscious of, or in different to the observation of the by standers, produced his large knife from his pocket, drew its blade out of its black leather sheath, tried the temper of its edge"], [242, "230 VALETTA. against his thumb-nail, and cut the string of the parcel, which he coiled up and stowed away in bis pocket. He then de liberately unfolded the brown paper, and dis played a hunch of home-made bread, and a slice of Dutch cheese. The very terrier turned away its head at this revelation. The old gentleman, how ever, naught abashed, hunted all his pockets as if in search of something yet wanting to the repast, and at last produced from a secret nook in his trousers a screw of paper wdiich proved to contain salt, and then flourishing his knife once or twice along his coat sleeve, he fell too, and was immediately absorbed in his repast. In the meantime the sisters were no less eagerly engaged in devouring the scene be fore them. The details of military evolutions, hoAv ever pleasing they may be to the eye, are not very intelligible to those who are unac quainted with the manual and platoon"], [243, "VALETTA. 231 exercises, those twin pillars on which the edifice of true glory rests. First one sees the fractions of the great machine dotted about in twos and threes over the ground, joking, quarrelling, grum bling according to their mood ; sturdy, tight built varlets with no particular ambition beyond a pot of beer, and with hardly a thought which extends in time beyond the day after to-morrow, or in space as far as the next market town, and who desire no better destiny than to fall very easy victims to the hangers on of the gates and can teen. A magic horn is one of the stock attri butes and stage properties of romance. Never was there a magic horn which con jured such magical wonders as the bugle, Avhich now shrilly sounds forth the assembly.

Well, the bugles have sounded the as sembly. The men are clustering together about their sergeants, and presently the thing begins to take shape. They are forming iu squads, and the eyes of the officer are running them over. Then there is a telling off, addings and takings away to equalize the strength of the companies, for all this Juggernauting-busi ness is to be done as regularly as a sum on a boy's slate. Next, perhaps, they get into open column of companies, all the time apparently some what confused, until just as the spectators, our fiends from Norley included, are be-"], [245, "233 VALETTA. ginning to wonder whether the whole thing is not a bungle and a failure, there is a sudden roar of command, and the mia;htv machine, with its thousand bright fire-locks and its thousand stout hearts, left-wheel's into one long double line extending across the entire ground. \u2022 No wall, Avith uncomfortable glass bottles on the top of it, warnings of traps and guns, and notices of the terrors of the law of trespass, could stand firmer, more imposing, or more impregnable, than does this living wall surmounted by its glittering bayonets. Presently all along the front of it, little trap doors open, and the officers pop out in front of their men, the colours in the centre. Then there is a pause of expectation ; the cautionary word for \" general salute \" is given \u2014 the spectators hold their breath, the poor old inspecting general canters forth on his steady grey steed as gallantly as may be, followed by the streaming plumes of his staff and the eyes of ali beholders."], [246, "234 VALETTA. \" Present arms !\" roars the colonel. In an instant \u2014 in three instants \u2014 with a one, two, three, and a sharp click, click, and a ringing clang, a thousand muskets are passed up ; \u2014 swords recover and fall ; \u2014 colours bend forward ; drums roll, and the gallant inspecting general finds himself saluted, and acknowledges the compliment as much in the Duke of Wellington's style as possible. Then the worthy general goes down the front of the line, slowly progressing along the ranks scrutinizing belts and buttons, and peeping into knapsacks, a long and somewhat tedious process to the ladies in the distance. Then came the second act of the per formances. \" I think we will see them march past,\" bows the gallant general, and accordingly he takes up his position near the carriage of the Squire, and Valetta, with her little hands firmly knit together, is silent with enthusiasm, and Rhoda equally silent with"], [247, "235 VALETTA. dismay as soon as they understand what is going to happen. On come the troops in serried columns. First the band in their Avhite coats, their hearts and lungs full,of firsta slow march, and then the British Granadiers, or the Lass of Gowrie ; next come the sapeure in their leather aprons. Arrived opposite to the general, the band, which was under the auspices of a magnificent functionary with a large silver headed cane who, for his conduct on that trying day, was at once, on the field itself, promoted in Rhoda's imagination to the rank of colonel \u2014 the band wheeled off and halted. Then came the colonel, then the grena diers \u2014 officers in front \u2014 swords rising to the salute ; then the remainder of the right wing, company by company; then came the colours with a knot of chubby, tightly girded sergeants ; then more officers with ported swords \u2014 more companies, until the whole procession was closed by the light company"], [248, "236 VALETTA. commanded by a charming little captain, a noted dancer, with a looped sash and a silver whistle at his button. After this part of the proceedings Avas likewise at an end, and the regiment had resumed its former ground, the general ordered a variety of man\u0153uvres which were accomplished with much shouting and wheeling, much apparent confusion, and as before, real order. Then came the tile-firing \u2014 the firing by platoons and the volley \u2014 the rapid for mation of the solid square to resist nothing; and the headlong charge of the little boys to pick up the fragments of cartridges. At last the whole thing was at an end \u2014 The general expressed to the colonel his entire satisfaction at the high state of dis cipline in which he had found the regiment; \u2014 The colonel intimated to the captains that the general was delighted at the bril liant bearing of the corps ; \u2014 and the corporal on gate duty revealed to such of"], [249, "VALETTA. 237 the spectators as were not in too great a hurry to depart, that his grace, the commander-in-chief had expressly desired the general to present his compliments to the colonel and say that for cleanliness, sobriety, steadiness under arms, and general good conduct the Royal Buffalos Avas by far the first regiment in the service. There were not very many however who cared to listen to these encomiums, for the moment the general disappeared to inspect the captain's books there was a universal move towards the gates, and the question became not which was to be considered the first regiment in the service, but which should be the first carriage to leave the ground. \" Is all the bobbery over, Jacob,\" cried the Squire, as he wiped his knife on his sleeve, and placed it in its sheath. It is a melancholy fact, that during the whole of this exciting scene he had not paid the slightest attention to anything but his lunch."], [250, "238 VALETTA. \" Yes, sir, I expect so,\" replied the fac totum. \" Well get the nose-bags off then, but don't move yet a while \u2014 I'm not a going to have my panels stove in to please no body.\" This remark was intended as a hint to the wigged coachman of the barouche, who had commenced a series of backings and whippings forward which rendered the Squire uneasy. \" I wish you a very good day, mum,' groAvled he Avith a nod. Off went the fairy car, its occupant ac knowledging Mr .Hardyman's salute with a languid smile ; Rhoda exchanging grave and earnest glances with the little boy ; and her sister fairly kissing her hand to him ; an honour which, after a whispered consul tation with his mama, he leaned out of the carriage and returned in kind. \"What a charming fellow!\" cried Valetta. \" But so young,\" said Rhoda."], [251, "239 VALETTA. \" Now you may go Tom,\" said the Squire \u2014 \"and mind \u2014 not so fast home.\" At the barrack gate they came up with the little pony carriage of Miss Merryton, who, if the truth were to be told, had been doing her best all the morning to evade them, having fallen in with Scammony and several other of her \" flirts,\" to whom she had determined to dedicate the afternoon. \" Ah ! you sad man,\" she cried, shaking her bonnet, her curls, and her whip, at the Squire. \" Ugh !\" grunted the old gentleman, shutting his eyes. \" Oh lor !

Now, Tom, look alive,\" cried the Squire. \" We would come home by your side, but I must drive to the library to advertise grandmama's brooch.\" \" Now, Tom,\" cried the Squire. \" Mind, you must come now that you have found out the road.

CHAPTER X. The expedition of the morning had pro tracted the frugal dinner of the family at Norley Court so much beyond the usual hour that by the time that meal was con cluded the evening shadows had completely taken the place of day. The cloth had been removed, and on the table was placed a plate of apples and two decanters, the one containing port and the other a very questionable straw-coloured mixture, which the Squire palmed off upon"], [259, "VALETTA. 247 his unsophisticated grand-children under the sounding title of \" orange wine.\" There were two candles on the table ; one of them was extinguished ; by the light of the other the old gentleman was sitting poring over an almanack which constituted his usual light reading. He had drawn this single candle close to him, and he was hold ing his book up immediately behind it in such a way as to shut out the two girls from the benefit of its feeble light. As he read on slowly, and with apparent difficulty, he followed the words with the blade of his knife, which he had drawn from his pocket to cut an apple lying on a plate at his side. To the girls the scanty light would have been a matter of no consequence, even if they had been less accustomed to it. They were sitting whispering together at the other end of the table, comparing notes on all the wonders they had seen on this most wonderful of days. Occasionally they would pause for a"], [260, "248 VALETTA. moment, either to resist the encroachments of Quirk, who was rendered desperate by the consciousness of the presence of apples, or to respond to the mute appeals of Juno, Avho rearing herself up would sit with her fore-paws in the air, her tongue out at the corner of her mouth, and eyes as wistful as those of a professional and starving mendi cant, when he silently takes up his post, crouching against a wall, chalking on the ground at his feet; \u2014 \" I am starving ;\" and who is conscious that his veal cutlets and glass of grog at night will depend on the success of his appeal to public credulity. There is a special system of topography in every house dependent on the habits, associations and characters of its occu pants. It was the high behest of the Squire that this room, in which the party were now assembled, should be called the parlour. The parlour it accordingly became. It could not have been seen under a light more propitious than that afforded"], [261, "VALETTA. 249 by this one solitary candle with the long unsnuffed wick.

The walnut-wood table was dark with the stains of past conviviality \u2014 conviviality Avhich certainly dated back for half a century. Around the room, from their dimmed frames, a row of hard-featured periwigged ancestors looked down upon their degenerate descendent. Some of them were in doublet and hose ; others in the buff leather jerkins, and broad hats of the days of trouble; others again in the huge rolled wig of the earlier Hanoverian reigns. There was the father of old Joe as sturdy as if he had been cast in iron. Tnere was m 5"], [262, "250 VALETTA. his brother, the admiral, with a pig tail and a blue coat with laced lappels. There was the ship which his grandfather had com manded. The ship which his brother had commanded, and paintings of two of his actions. A print of the death of Nelson, and another representing the monument in St. Paul's, erected to the memory of Ad miral Hardyman. Among these worthies there had origi nally figured a portrait of the Squire him self, in the dress of a midshipman with a dirk at his side, and his fair hair parted from his open brows. There was something about it, or about the associations which it suggested not al together pleasing to the old gentleman. He had it taken down, and removed into a lumber attic, where it was placed with its face to the wall, and forgotten by all ex cept Valetta and Rhoda, who would, at intervals, in the course of their ramblings among the old deserted rooms at the top of the house, make an expedition to see \" dear"], [263, "251 VALETTA. grandpapa, ' and to wonder how beautiful he had been, and to moralize, after their own fashion, on the effects of time. \" It was in this historical parlour then, that the family were seated, and that Rhoda, whose eye sought propriety in all things, was making up her mind to hint to \" dear grandpapa \" that his candle wanted snuffing. Now the old gentleman did not like to be interrupted while reading, for though he totally forgot all about his subject the moment he put his book down, he was completely engrossed by it for the mo ment Rhoda was accordingly watching in silence until the old gentleman's eye should have travelled to the bottom of a page to arouse him from his study, when a sound was heard which rendered her interference unnecessary. Suddenly there burst upon the ears of the group the rattling noise of carriage wheels coming up the drive at speed, and"], [264, "252 VALETTA. in the next instant there was a loud, double knock at the door. \" A wisiter ! cuss me if it aint,\" cried the Squire, dropping the book. \" What next . A wisiter, at this time o' night \u2014 Lor 'ave mercy ! 'alf an hour earlier, he would have caught us at dinner.\" And seizing on the decanters, he has tened to stow them away in a cup board. Presently there came another double knock, and then a ring \u2014 a peal which sounded through the .vhole house. \" Ring aAvay, pray, sir \u2014 a little louder, if you can \u2014 we're all deaf.\" Another ring. \" That's it, sir. We're well to do, and can afford to have the Avires mended every day. Be so good as to ring again, and be cussed to you,\" growled the old man in a crescendo of bitterness.

Avith the dignity of the house, was leisurely crossing the hall towards the door. The Squire suddenly pounced out upon him. \" Heigh there ! you sir \u2014 you cussed little Jacob \u2014 you leave my service this day month, as sure as you're born. Don't stand there a staring, or they'll pull the front door down.\" As to what you are pleased to say about my leaving you, sir,\" said the man, sud denly pulling up, \" I can only say, sir, that, perhaps, I had better go \u2014 for what with so many masters to please \u2014 with a Jacob here \u2014 Jacob there \u2014 and Jacob everywhere \u2014 one does not know which way to turn.\" \" Ugh !\" grunted the Squire. But the factotum saw his advantage, and persisted \u2014 \" One says Jacob do this \u2014 another says Jacob do that.

When it's that, you come sneaking in with your tails atween your legs, and a pack of gammon about the times \u2014 I know you.\" \" Well done, Jacob,\" said the old Squire, retreating within the parlour door, but holding it partially open, that he might be able to superintend the impending contro versy.

This time, a long leather case, also care fully strapped down. \" Wery good,\" said Joe, nodding his head, and thrusting his hands to the bottom of his pockets. \" I'll make a clean house of 'em.

Next in came a gun-ca-e. Then a leather case, gathered into the form of a bag at the top. Then a low, fiat case of japanned tin. \" May the Lord forgive me, if I know whether I am a sleep or awake,\" said the old man. \"What next ? anything more? oh, yes ! here it comes. Eh, why, what's"], [269, "257 VALETTA. all this? I'm cussed if that Jacob hasn't gone and let in a conjuror, with all his traps.\" This exclamation was called forth by the appearance of another japanned tin case of a nearly semi-circular form. \" Why, what the deuce and all is this.\" \" A. cocked-hat, grandpapa,\" exclaimed the voice of Rhoda. \" Cock -'at be hanged,\" cried the old man, turning sharply round. Immediately behind him stood Valetta, looking over his shoulder, and on a chair behind her, stood Rhoda on tip-toes, the candle raised above her head. At the word \" cocked-hat,\" Valetta sud denly retired, and sat down at the other end of the room, with her face turned away from the door. \" How do you know it's a cock-'at?\" \" Valetta say so.\" \" Much she knows. When did she ever see a cock-'at, I should like to know ?\""], [270, "258 VALETTA.

I knowed there'd be a judg ment on us.\" Presently the door opened, and in walked Jacob, with a serene air, which seemed to express the pleasure he derived from this complete abattement and discomfiture of his master.

Now came the grand stroke of Jacob's policy, and the crowning moment of his triumph. He threw open the door and announced in a loud tone, \" The gentleman.\" He closed it after him and retired, leaving the stranger, who had been an auditor of the past dialogue, standing in the middle of the room. \" Hope I see you well, sir,\" said the old gentleman, rising and making and awkward obeisance. \" What may be your pleasure with me?\" Although what the new comer had al ready heard, was not of a nature calculated to re-assure one entering, for the first time, into a strange house to claim the hospitality of strangers, the visitor did not betray any embarrassment ; but, advancing with an air of easy confidence and complete self-"], [274, "262 VALETTA. possession, he placed in the Squire s hand a letter and a card. \" That is my name, sir,\" said he, in a soft musical voice. \" This letter will explain the circumstances under which I have taken the liberty of paying my respects to you. I regret that my intrusion seems likely to interfere with the arrangements of your household.

Valetta's eye was on her grandpapa again. This time raised furtively, and only for a single instant.

Peeping over the old gentleman's arm, she murmured forth as she read the card, \" Captain Clarence Bellairs !\" And then she stole a look at Valetta who, seated at the other end of the room, had deserted Quirk, and was trying to stare the sedate Juno out of countenance. She did not raise her eyes ; but there was a little tremulous twitch of her face, which said, \" I hear you and mark you.\" \" Well, Cap'en,\" said the old gentleman, \" I never said your intrusion would inter fere, and all that bobbery \u2014 not a word of it.

But this was not all, the black riding coat had given place to a blue one of still more egregious form ; a purple stripe had wound itself into the neckcloth; the waist coat had become one of the most delicate batiste ; the trousers were of the most ex quisite fawn colour, relieved by a broad margin of braid, and the very boots were even smaller and more shiny than those of the night. As the Captain entered the room, he drew off a lavender glove (Maison d'Hiver, E. 20), wdiich he had put on to defend himself from the currents of air he must necessarily encounter in his passage from his bed-room to the Squire's parlour, and placed his delicate little jewelled hand in the old man's horny paw. None who saw that act, and was able to calculate the effect it must have cost, could, after that, have doubted that the captain was no mere carpet knight; but, in his own way, as great a hero as Mutius Sc\u00e6vola of old."], [297, "285 VALETTA, The Squire's eye wandered over his guest's person ; and, at length, fixed itself on the wonderful chatelaine, the only arti cle remaining of the e\u00e6uvi\u0153 of the captain of the night before. What did the old gentleman think of his guest? Did he wonder, as he would have done at a prize wurzel or a fancy pig? Did he admire, or deplore, or what? The old gentiemau stared on at the cha telaine with its mimic pistols, and trum pets, and frying-pans, anchors, high-heeled shoes, and all the rest, harder and harder; and there was no clue to his opinions, un less it could have been derived from the fact, that his tongue was gathered up and thrust out into a lump in one of his cheeks. \" Hope I see you well, Cap'en,\" he said, at length, withdrawing himself by an evi dent effort from his contemplations. The captain replied that he was well, and clandestinely inserted his hands among"], [298, "286 VALETTA. the folds of a delicately-scented cambric handkerchief. The Captain next saluted the young ladies \u2014 Rhoda replying, with her eyes still wandering over the talismanic chatelaine. Valetta murmuring out something with her eyes fixed on the bottom of a tea-cup. Had the lady's headache left her? That was the question. No ; it seemed that it had not ; for, dur ing the whole meal, she sat with downcast eyes and the same spot still burning in her cheeks. The order of the meal was thus : The Squire sat at the bottom of the table, Avith a huge knife in his hand, cut ting off square, geometrical slices from the loaf of coarse, domestic bread, wdiich lay on a wooden trencher before him. On his left sat the Captain. Opposite to him, at the other end of the table, Rhoda, with the most matronly gra vity, presided over the tea-cups; while, close to her left elbow, sat Valetta."], [299, "VALETTA. 287 The philosopher who is accustomed to have his axioms unhesitatingly obeyed, knows not whether or not he is a philosopher, for he is not exposed to those trials which are the best test of philosophy. The poor Squire was, on this morning, doomed to acquire some experience on this subject, for he was doomed to see his most cherished rules infringed. In common with many other heads of families, he had certain uncomfortable little domestic crotchets to which he clung with a tenacity proportionate to their absurdity. There were certain matters, little luxuries of the table, which, if indulged, would, he stoutly declared, inevitably end in bis being carted off to the \" work'us ;\" and against which he, therefore, very naturally, and very decidedly, set his face. He considered, for instance, that though to take either milk or sugar with tea was permissible, yet that to indulge in both was a dangerous heresy, tending directly to the perdition of his fortunes. The same rule"], [300, "288 VALETTA. held good with regard to meat and butter, and a dozen other little things.

May as well ask him before you pour it out.\" Alas! the Captain took both milk and sugar, and the old gentleman could only turn up his eyes in a supplementary pro test. Moreover, the Captain, after helping himself to butter, thought he would take a slice of ham, and Valetta cut it for him Avith a steady hand, and looked the old gen tleman unflinchingly in the face the while. Nor was this all, for the Captain, without taking any notice of the little parallelo grams of bread which the Squire had pre pared, drew towards him the loaf, and with his own delicate hands, chipped off several little choice knobs of crust for his own per sonal consumption. Valetta, with her little brown eyes flashing defiance, and with her cheeks glowing, was in the meantime looking round the table, as if in search of an anta- VOL. I. 0"], [302, "290 VALETTA. gonist. Rhoda was more calmly deter mined. \" Quirk,\" said the unconscious guest, holding out his hand to Valetta's little puppy, which was regarding him Avist fully from beneath a neighbouring chair. In an instant Quirk bounded into his lap, and resumed his investigation of the chatelaine, at the point at which he had left off on the previous evening. \"Poor little fellow,\" said the Captain, in his low, musical tones, as his hand again played with the long black, silken, ears of the animal ; \" I like to have you there.\" Valetta moA'ed on her chair. It was the slightest movement in the world ; but when the guest looked up, he found that the old silver tea-urn Avas immediately between him and the mistress of his protege. While this was going on, the Squire had not been idle. Having taken his knife from his pocket, he unsheathed it, and set to work to prune the loaf in such a Avay as to repair as well as might be the"], [303, "VALETTA. 291 irregularities occasioned by the Captain's wanton havoc. \"P'raps, Cap'en,\" said he, as he con cluded his task, \" you'd like to give the dog a good junk of meat at once?\" To those who were acquainted with the Squire and his notions, this proposition must have seemed barbed with the most galling irony. The guest, however, appeared to take it quite au pied de la lettre, and pro nouncing it a very good idea actually carved off, and threw to the dog a slice, which the Squire would have considered the maximun of a christian meal. The old man rubbed his hands more cheerily than ever. The thing was be coming far too serious to be taken seriously \" Thank God,\" thought be, as he glanced at the open collar of his guest \u2014 \" any how I can hang the dog, and will afore twenty four hours are over.\" Somewhat restored to himself by this reflexion, he recovered sufficient self-posses sion to trust himself to address his guest. o 2"], [304, "292 VALETTA. \" Cap'n I'm werry sorry I can't pass the morning with you, (\"and the Lord forgive me for lying,\" he interpolated in his own mind) but I've my affairs to look after, and so I must turn you over to the gals.\" The Captain bowed, and took the oppor tunity, while he remembered it, of men tioning to the Squire that he had taken the liberty of ordering one of his horses to be sent over from the barracks, in the event of his not returning on the previous night; and that, in point of fact, he was expecting its arrival almost every instant\" As soon as it came, he thought that instead of trespassing on the young ladies' time, he would take a little ride. \" Liberty indeed,\" thought old Joe, \" I rather think so.

Werry appy to see you, and in course, your orse too.\" No sooner had the visitor expressed bis intention of riding out, and seeking such"], [305, "293 VALETTA. amusement as he might be able to find in an examination of the neighbouring country, than Valetta's head-ache seemed to have left her. She raised her eyes \u2014 came out from behind her shelter \u2014 fed her dog \u2014 talked to it\u2014 and finally, retired with her sister from the room without exhibiting any especial signs of confusion. The Squire almost immediately after wards withdrew to his own little sanctum. He had no sooner closed its door, aud shut out the wrorld, than he began to conduct himself in a somewhat excentric manner. Without pausing to take off his coat, or to tap his barometer, he, at once, threw himself into his arm-chair, and raising his hands and eyes several times to the ceiling, he gasped out the words, \"Oh, lor \u2014 oh, lor, ave mercy on us! \u2014 Oh, lor !\" writhing about all the time as if he were under the hands of a dentist.

I have come to speak about changing his room.\" There is, of course, a sufficient reason for everything that happens, more especially for every disinterested service rendered by a stranger. The fact was, that Jacob, the serA'ing man, had taken the visitor under his pro tection. In the first place, this arrival had assisted that functionary in obtaining a triumph over bis master. In addition, it was prophetic of certain perquisites to himself. He therefore was anxious that the chamber appropriated by the Squire to bis guest should be changed for one more in accordance with \" the Capting's\" quality, and his own legitimate expectations. \" The room's a good un, and airy. What's amiss with it?\" said the Squire, stoutly."], [307, "VALETTA. 295 \" Why, your honour, I'm afraid it won't hold the Capting's boots and shoes.\" \" Not hold 'em ; what do you mean ?\" \" The Capting has twenty-one pair of boots and shoes, and three pair of slippers,\" announced Jacob, in a tone worthy of the gravity of the communication. \" Oh lor, a've mussy,\" exclaimed Joe.

There was a look of wild terror about the old man's face as his eyes wandered vacantly over the room. \"What is it, sir? \u2014 what is it?\" whispered"], [308, "296 VALETTA. the man, taking him by the hand, and seating him in a chair. For a time the old gentleman made no answer. \" What is it, sir?\" whispered the man, again gently shaking his arm. The Squire pulled out a handkerchief and wiped his forehead, on which the large drops stood. \" Here,\" said he, \" Stoop down \u2014 low er.

Give me my hat.\" The Squire had hardly sallied forth from his little den before his mind was re called from these imaginative horrors by more immediate and tangible causes of alarm. Soon after the party had risen from breakfast the visitor's horse had arrived. As the groom, who had brought it, was walking it to and fro before the door, the sisters from an upper window had the op- o 5"], [310, "298 VALETTA. portunity of convincing themselves, that the steed was in every way worthy of its owner. It was a coal black charger, a dainty beast with an arching neck, a fiery eye, and feet which seemed hardly to deign to touch the earth. \" It looks as if it would kick any one who came near it,\" said Rhoda. \" Any one but him,\" murmured the other sister. And she was perhaps right, for Avhen presently the captain came forth and placed his hand caressingly on its neck, the neck arched more proudly, the fire deepened in the beast's eyes, and it pawed the earth with its foot in exulting expectation. The Captain cast a glance upwards at the windows, and in an instant the two little maidens were routed and flying in confusion from their post. They took refuge in the nursery, and presently, having invested themselves in their broad straw hats, they passed into the garden."], [311, "299 VALETTA. Once secure in this safe retreat they set to work to amuse themselves after their OAvn fashion, without restraint. Accordingly striking off into a grass walk, protected on either side by thick espaliers, they passed their arms round each other, and concealing their blushing cheeks and whispering mouths under the shade of their broad hats, they Avalked on deep in their own affairs, attended by Juno, who trotted on slowly in the path before them, every now and then pausing and lolling out her tongue, and turning up her eyes with an expression of the most comic anguish, which seemed to say \" You see what I am going through rather than not be here to take care of you.\" The little obese animal, with a persistency worthy of higher intelligence, held on stoutly in the path of duty until there arose a temptation to swerve from it, which pre sented itself in the shape of a certain sunny spot. It was a sheltered nook, where under an"], [312, "300 VALETTA. old south wall some dilapidated glass frames spread themselves out to court the sun's Avarmest embraces. Arrived at this point, Juno threw him self on the ground and refused to move further. Rhoda gathered a rose and placed it under her collar \u2014 No \u2014 It would not do; she was not to be tempted by sentimenta lities. However the rose gathering once com menced could not stop there \u2014 Another rose must be gathered for Valetta, Avho gathered still another for Rhoda's hat and then half a-dozen more for any contingency which might arise. At this moment there was a sharp, sud den bark behind them, and Quirk darting forward seized his mother by the ears. The girls turned round to the rescue, with a merry laugh, when suddenly they perceived that the captain was at their side. What was to be done ? There could be no doubt \u2014 every one blushed."], [313, "VALETTA 301 \"I altered my mind,\" said the Captain, the first to recover himself. \" I felt more inclined to \u2014 that is \u2014 I did not feel inclined to ride.\" A few more stammered sentences, a great many more blushes, and the conversation languished. The Captain made a desperate effort. \" Those are beautiful roses,\" murmured he, \" are you fond of flowers ?\" Valetta held them out mechanically. The motion was misunderstood. The Captain possessed himself of a flower, and the confusion became worse confounded than before. Here then was the dead lock of the drama tist, from which there seemed no other escape but that old one, of all parties going off kneeling. Here, however, it was fated that the Squire should intervene, and certainly it was a dignus vindice nodus. As the old gentleman was passing along the hall he happened to cast his eyes through"], [314, "302 VALETTA. the open door, which led to the garden, and his glance at once fell upon the group. \"Oh, the deuce,\" he cried, \"I'll be cussed if that ere Cap'en ain't a cutting of my cowcumbers. High there ! hulloa !\" And without pausing, he rushed out to rescue his property, and in another moment was in the midst of the group. All eyes were turned upon him. \" Beg pardon Cap'en,\" said he, \" thought you were raising them glasses. The cow cumbers won't stand the air \u2014 You find it dull here I dare say, with the children. If you'll step with me, I'll just show you the pigs.\" While the Captain Avas explaining vrith the most delicate consideration for the old gentleman's feelings, that he did not find the garden and its flowers stupid, and that he had no inclination to see his pigs, Rhoda slipped off to bring her grandfather's hat, aud presently came tripping back over the lawn, bearing it in her hand. Nor was this all that she brought Avith"], [315, "VALETTA. 303 her, for by her side came a dazzling appa rition whose glace silks, and satins, and jewels, and pink bonnet revealed her to be no less a personage than the fair Merryton, bearing in her hand the el d' Alain parasol, emblem of conquest and universal sway. \" Od rabbit that Jacob, if he aint gone and let in that o?<dacious young hussey again,\" exclaimed the Squire, as this vision burst upon his view."], [316, "304 VALETTA.

Valetta however did not respond to the invitation with kindred warmth. She had nothing to say in favour of soldiering \u2014 not a word \u2014 indeed she had nothing to say at all, and so she blushed and turned pale and seemed very desirous of presenting her visitor to Captain Bellairs. And now, indeed, there came a charming little scene of confusion and embarrassment \u2014 for the heroine of the pink bonnet seemed for the first time to become aware of the presence of the stranger, wrho had fallen back three yards behind Valetta, and had been actively employing his mo-"], [318, "306 VALETTA. ment of leisure, in curling the end of his moustache round his fore-finger. At first she shrunk back, as might a fawn startled by the hunters, or our old friend of the galleries \u2014 the nymph sur prised by a satyr ; but after a moment of most becoming hesitation, she recovered herself sufficiently to acknowledge his salute with dignified reserve, and then she at once turned away to the old Squire who, with his little eyes keenly fixed upon the group, and with his hand passing con stantly over his mouth to conceal his smiles, had been intensely enjoying the scene. \"Oh dear! oh dear!\" thought the Squire. \" The young baggage ! She's a trying it on with that poor green-horn a'ready.\" \"And you! you naughty man!\" said Miss Merryton, laying the little ivory tip of her parasol upon the Squire's threadbare arm. The old gentleman adopted the young"], [319, "VALETTA. 307 lady's ruse, and in his turn affected a surprised and serious air. \" Oh, lor ! Hope I see you well, mum,\" said he, raising his hat with a flourish, which surpassed the Captain's. \"Hope I see you very well.\" One of the little primrose gloves fastened itself gently upon a button of the old gentleman's coat, and then the lady, secure of her prisoner, and determined to give no quarter, turned her deep eyes full upon him, and gazed at him for some moments in silence. \" No !\" said she at length, shaking her clustering ringlets at him. \" I am not well ; and what is more, I ought to be very angry with you.\" \"Lor! mum.\" \" Yes, you are responsible for it. I fear you are responsible for a great deal.\" \" No, mum,\" answered Joe at once, with a decision of manner, which showed that on that point he had no doubt. \" I beg pardon for differing with a lady, but I am"], [320, "308 VALETTA. never responsible for any thing. It's a bad Avay. \" Let every one manage his own affairs, and mind his own business, that's my rule.\" \" Ah !\" said the young lady, impatiently, \"lam not thinking of business.

You have been a gay, wicked, heart breaking, deceitful man.\" said she, as Avith a gentle impulse on the button she led him away from the rest of the party. They walked on, and at length paused by the rose-tree, and the old cucumber frames. When they returned there was a rose in the Squire's button-hole, and his hands were stuck jauntily into his tail coat pockets."], [321, "VALETTA. 309 Rhoda looked at him out of her great eyes. \" Let me put your hat straight, dear grandpapa,\" said she, \"it will be off directly.\" The Squire took no heed of her, although his hat did in fact incline more rakishly over his right ear than it had done since the election ten years before Rhoda's birth. But Rhoda's astonishment was to be increased. As soon as the Squire's back was turned, she looked with all wonder at her sister, and whispered \u2014 \" He has cut a cucumber.\" And so he had, and there it was sticking out of his pocket After this, it was not so great a shock to hear Miss Merryton announce, when, after passingthrough the house, she gathered up the white reins of her little cream coloured ponies at the front door, that Joseph Hardyman, Esquire, tbeir revered grandpapa would on that day week give"], [322, "310 VALETTA. a dinner and an eA-ening party; neither was it even astonishing to hear the old gentleman admit his promise, and reite rate it stoutly, and end by thrusting the cucumber under the seat of the phaeton. Off dashed the ponies, and off floated the pink bonnet, the curls, and silks, and flowers, with one beaming triumphant glance which comprehended the whole party. As the el d' Alala departed, the Captain tAvisted his moustache for a moment, in silence, casting after her a parting glance of soul subduing, ferocious languishment \" Do you know that lady Avell,\" said he, at length, to Valetta, Avhen the carriage was out of sight. \" I like her exceedingly,\" was the re- Old Joe, in the mean time, retired to his study, without a word ; he fastened his door and throAving himself into a chair, thrust his hands to the bottom of his troAvser pockets."], [323, "VALETTA. 311 The contact of the few loose coins which usually lurked in those unfathomed reces ses seemed to restore him to himself. \" Ugh !\" he growled out, \" I've been and made a fool of myself again.\" \"Never mind,\" he added, presently \u2014 - \"after all the cowcumbers had gone to seed.\" During the ensuing week Peggy Franko learned more than the usual number of columns of spelling, for she was less fre quently than usual interrupted by her young mistresses. She admitted, towards the close of it, to Miss Rhoda, that she did not quite know whether she liked their visitor, and that she wished he would go, that Miss Valetta might recover her good spirits again, which"], [324, "312 VALETTA. the unusual restraint of a stranger's presence had impaired. Rhoda hoAvever put on a very grave face and explained that they were all bound to be polite to any one that dear grandpapa chose to invite, and that it was very wrong to wish the visitor away, even if it did make any one dull, so that Peggy was fain to hold her peace, and set herself down as a selfish and evil minded woman. Jacob was of the same opinion as Miss Rhoda, with regard to the visitor ; indeed he even went further, and pronounced decidedly in the Captain's favour. He delighted to marshal his wardrobe, to arrange the gold headed scent bottles, to exercise the mysteries of his craft on the twenty one pairs of boots and shoes. He ran over to the yard a dozen times a day to see that the black charger was properly groomed, and both felt in his heart, and declared loudly that the \" Capting,\" whose importance he had, by one of those little imperceptible links of"], [325, "313 VALETTA. vanity which bind so tightly, managed to associate with his own, was a centurion of centurions, an honour to his cloth, and Avorthy to be entertained by that most worthy of all entertainers \u2014 his honoured and infallible master. It soon now became evident even to the Squire that one of the consequences of the pledge of hospitality extorted from him by the fair Syren of Benchurch, was that the Captain must remain his guest until after the party, which might be con sidered as given partly in compliment to him as a visitor. \" Well,\" said the old gentleman, \" if it must be, it must be, and so it's no use fretting.\" As to attempt to amuse the Captain, however, the Squire at once washed his hands of that matter.

Regularly after breakfast, when the Squire had retired to his study, the charger was brought round, and its master would go out and caress it.

Then the Captain would not be able to make up his mind where to go or whether it Avould be better to take his ride an hour later, or in two hours, or in the afternoon, and at last he would dismiss the horse and say that he would send for it when he Avas ready. Next he had to give Quirk his lesson in leaping over a pocket-handkerchief tied to the back of one of the hall chairs.

Perhaps not quite in all though, for here comes the Captain back again, with his glittering chatelaine and his trousers of the daring plaid, and his little white hand caressing the silky moustache : and he informs her with that little, fierce, languishing maniera Carra vagesca, which has quickened the pulsations of so many fair ones in so many park broughams, that he has taken her message to Rhoda, and that in answer to her in quiries as to the progress of her garden, that young lady returns her compliments, and \"that she is going on as well as can be"], [332, "320 VALETTA. expected,\" and that she has added a special admonition to Valetta not to stand too long in the shade, where the grass is damp. And noAV the gallant Captain performs feats worthy of the devoted captains of yore, At the slightest hint from his fair hostess, he recklessly dashes into the middle of the softest and most earthy beds \u2014 plants his flower-sticks, and skips out again, an oc casional rueful glance at his little boots, each of which is carrying away about a pound weight of the unlucky Squire's landed property, alone betraying all his sufferings. The Squire does not mind though, not he. On the contrary he is secretly de lighted \u2014 he is never tired of examining the Captain's boots when he comes in to lunch on his return from their expeditions, and asking him if they will turn the Avet well. Then he strokes down his face, and orders Jacob to get a pair of his (the"], [333, "VALETTA. 321 Squire's) own boots thoroughly larded, in case the Cap'en should like to try them, which the Captain, whose association of mind, by a painful eccentricity, wanders aAvay to larded ortolans, shudderingly de clines, and then he turns with a sinking heart to the stale bread and mouldy cheese, and unspeakable beer before him. After the lunch, which is to the Captain one of the severest trials of the day, is happily over, there is again a faint show of having the charger round. The matter, hoAvever, languishes, and another half hour sees the Captain in the act of immolating another pair of boots, stepping out stoutly in company with the tAvo sisters as they thread their way through the green lanes which skirt the hamlet of Norley. As they wandered along, all the objects of interest were pointed out to the stranger. There was the pond in a little grassy SAveep by the road side, which was univer sally admitted to be bottomless, and into P 5"], [334, "322 A'ALETTA. Avhose dark depths, overhung by the willows, he was requested to gaze, that he might form an adequate idea of the perils of a certain traveller, who once upon a time, upon a dark and stormy night, lost his way, and whose vehicle wrecked therein, Avas supposed still to he somewhere in its un fathomed depths. The Captain protested that he could see the bottom of the pond, but the sisters stoutly shook their heads, and admitted to each other privately that this was the first occasion, since his arrival, on which he had been in the wrong. Again ; the Captain had to examine the outside of the house inhabited by the re markable man who had just buried his third wife \u2014 the gate post against which the post man was in the habit of hanging his bag \u2014 the place Avhere the gipsies encamped, and the other wonders of the locality. While the Captain was thus deriving amusement he was at the same time afford ing it ; for the few staring, startled rustics"], [335, "VALETTA. 323 whom they met, had seen nothing so note worthy as the man of war, his boots, trousers, breloques, and moustachoes, since the memorable passage of a troop of itinerant equestrian performers through the village. Our party from the Court would wander on and on through these green, sunny lanes, the trees waving over head, the birds carolling cheerilyr, and Quirk gambolling in the van, pricking up his ears and plotting mischief against every created thing. As to Juno, once clear of the village she left them, and quietly jogged home again. There was no lack of conversation ; the Captain, in his low, musical, and most per suasive voice, wooed like Othello of yore \" by bragging and telling fantastical lies,\" or descanted to them on that brilliant theme to which the imagination of a young country girl ever rises up unsatiated \u2014 he spoke to them of the Town and its Avonders \u2014 He drew for them, in vivid colouring, sketches, of that \u2014"], [336, "324 VALETTA. Ville eternelle Riante et belle Ou l'or etincelle De toute cot\u00a3. And in all his glowing episodes of \" opera, ball, and park, and play,\" it may be di vined that a certain Captain of horse was by no means forgotten, but rather played an important and prominent part. There was one walk which Avas an especial favourite Avith the Captain. It was the one which led through a little Avood to a hill from Avhich there Avas a fine prospect of the surrounding country. The Captain declared himself partial to fine prospects. The sisters desired nothing better than that he should express a wish on any sub ject. Day after day therefore found them threading this little thickly tangled coppice to arrive at the hill beyond it. Indeed, as far as Rhoda was concerned, this arrangement exactly suited her ; for"], [337, "325 VALETTA. she had conceived a passion for Avild floAvers, and once within the wood would wander away in quest of them in spite of Valetta's earnest entreaties and caution to the con trary. The two sisters seemed to be about to exchange characters. Rhoda Avas now constantly performing these daring feats, and was full of smiles, and conversation, and questionings, to the visitor ; while Valetta seemed to be growing every day, more and more silent, thoughtful, and timid. O 7 She would begin to say something per haps\u2014the most trifling thing in the world \u2014 presently' her voice would falter \u2014 then she Avould break doAvn altogether, and give a little half glance to her sister, who would step in boldly to the rescue, and finish the sentence for her. Or perhaps she would walk on and on Avith her broad hand concealing her face ; the Captain's Ioav musical voice con tinuing his eternal refrain the while. Sud-"], [338, "326 VALETTA. denly she would seem to understand that it Avas to her he was speaking, and then she would raise her head for an instant, and quickly lower it again, as she felt that those eyes Avere fixed upon her ; and the two red stains upon her cheek would deepen and deepen until they overspread even her neck. If the Captain was a connoisseur in eyes, and had a desire to see hers \u2014 as at times almost seemed to be the case \u2014 it was not gratified, for they neArer once met his glance. Poor Captain! But how could he feel any interest in the matter, when he had such eyes of his own. Those terrible eyes a la perdition de I'dme. Well, day after day they threaded the wood. There was still that low musical voice going on and on. There was still Quirk making desperate efforts to circumvent the little birds on the top boughs ; still Rhoda losing herself in the wood, and returning"], [339, "327 VALETTA. with two little bouquets \u2014 one for the Captain, the other for Valetta. Then there Avas the breezy quarter of an hour on the green knoll, on the hill top \u2014 the spot Avhere tradition and Dr. Bolfey had laid to rest the Saxon warriors of the old time. From this point there was the merry blue sea, with its dotting sails. The gentle wind from over the water \u2014 the Avind which had once borne the old Saxons to the pro mised land \u2014 which now pressed its vfgorous benediction on the brows of the noble toiling race their descendents, and which ruffled the wild flowers on their ancient grave \u2014 the gentle wind which gave its especial blessing to that fair girl, who had her sympathies and her confidences with every created thing, from itself as it stooped doAvn from its heavenly path to woo and whisper to her, down to the little pet frog, for which she had made a home in an old broken flower pot in the"], [340, "328 VALETTA. garden, and to which she in her credulity secretly carried out bread-crumbs. From this spot also, Avhen the eye looked inland, there was that rich mass of elm foliage, from the midst of AAdiich rose the square, grey tower of Norley Church. Noav, more than at any past time, the heart of the girl sought that old grey tower \u2014 sought to commune with the spirit of the departed mother. Pause \u2014 For a moment she is absent from that hill, and pondering by the lonely grave-stone ; and then she is back again, with fresh confidence, to listen to the music of that voice at her ear. It is a fearful toy to play with, is a woman's heart. A thing of strange, unknown and irreparable mechanism. The Captain praised the view, and twirling his moustache, took out his watch Avith the rattling, glittering brcloques, and feared that it Avas time to be going home to dinner."], [341, "VALETTA. 329 And so it was \u2014 It was the time to a minute. He was right. He was always right. And thus they came out, and went home again. Each day the same, and yet each day how different ! During this week the Squire's position had not been so unpleasant as might have been naturally expected. Perhaps the visitor's appetite suffered in consequence of the change in his habits of life, for after one of these strolls through the wood to the top of the hill, he dis continued his wine at dinner. Then he gave up meat at breakfast, and began to think that it was a bad plan to take both milk and sugar in tea. It was a melancholy but, at the same time, instructive sight to see the Captain in his glorious toilette, sitting at the breakfast table with a hunch of stale bread before him, watching the Squire's eye to slip a piece of it into his pocket \u2014 sipping his tea \u2014 drawing his essenced hand lightly"], [342, "330 VALETTA. across his mouth to conceal his disgust, and then rising with a hearty air, and declaring that he had made a capital meal. It was a thing to speculate on was that expression in the girls' faces. In a few hours a bud becomes a flower ; in a feAV days a child may become a woman. For one of them \u2014 if not for both \u2014 the day had arrived. The sun had shone forth. She Avas a woman, and the veil was lifted from her soul. She stood forth adorned Avith all the glorious attributes of womanhood ; but amongst them Avas that one fatal gift, given from of old. \u2014 To know good from evil. With a new pulse beating at her heart. \u2014 with a new life in her soul ; the scales dropped from her eyes, and she saw the Squire as he was \u2014 no longer as the revered and infallible old man of old; but as he teas. God knows Avhat graces and good gifts she lent him from her pure heart to deck up his image, and render it still lovely to her ; but in spite of it all, there she caught"], [343, "VALETTA. 331 glimpses of the man himself at the bottom- Not the man himself in all his imperfec tions; but sufficient of him to make her see that she had worshipped a shadow. Was there nothing, my poor Valetta, to be learned from this ? No \u2014 It is allotted to us as part of our trials to make many cruel discoveries in the course of our lives ; but it has been mercifully vouchsafed to us, to make them singly, and at long intervals. Had Ave to begin life with the burden of all the knowledge which we shall, by degrees, acquire, we should lie down, and ask at once to end it. Valetta then, as she sat a witness of her grandfather's inhospitality, sat with her face raised boldly up, for the first time since the Captain's arrival ; and with blushing cheeks, and her eyes flashing brightly, she sought to meet the glance of the old man. The old gentleman's gaze, however, wTas not raised to meet hers. He moved uncomfortably in his seat, with a side glance at Rhoda, who,"], [344, "332 VALETTA. taking in the whole matter in a single instant from her sister's eye and look, wisely concluded that it was best to endeavour to pass it quietly off, and was sitting with doAvncast head \u2014 a most ostentatious figure of woe. There was no comfort in that quarter. He gave a half glance at Valetta; but instantly withdrew his eyes again, and chipped off a morsel of bread with his knife, to outward seeming abstracted within himself. \" Oh, lor,\" he murmured, \" that 'ere girl is her mother over again. She's a beginning to run rusty just as t'other one did \u2014 we must bear her up a bit, and take her off her corn, or there'll be the deuce and all to pay by-and-bye. END OP VOL. I. 7 OC 51 T. C.
