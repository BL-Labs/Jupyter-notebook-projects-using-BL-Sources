It was a very dull and depressing day: a thick and dirty fog had been succeeded by continuous small rain. It was besides cold and raw ; while, notwithstanding the bright fires Mrs. Cecil Mortimer heaped up, every room was dark ; and in order to see, it was necessary to sit very near the window. Ruth lay in a couch in the small breakfast parlour which had been given up to her and Ellen. She was pale and almost emaciated, and now the tears were rolling over her face, while Ellen, seated at a little distance, and looking nearly as pale, had let her work drop and was trying to cheer her little sister. \" If I could only live with you, Nellie! somewhere \u2014 anywhere ! \" \" But you see, Hetty seems to be very comfortable VOL. HI. B"], [10, "2 UPS AND DOWNS. and happy, and you will have Bessie's children,\" rejoined Ellen. \"Hetty is so different! She can make herself pleasant. Every one likes Hetty.\" \" And you will have Bessie. Don't you know how fond you always were of her? You will be able to comfort her if you try.\" \" Oh, no ; how can I ? She will be talking of\u2014 of poor John, and, though I am very sorry for her and him, how can I ? She would be sure to find out that I did not really love him.\" \"It is not the least likely that she woidd speak of him to you. When I said, * comfort her,' of course I meant indirectly, and by showing her love and kind ness.\" \" I had rather stay with you,\" Ruth persisted ; \" you are my sister : why shouldn't we live together ? \" \" Because, you know, I have left my home. It can't be helped now, Ruth,\" she said, in a hasty, dry tone of voice. \" Perhaps, some day \u2014 who knows ? \u2014 I may have \" But she checked herself, and leaning her head on her hand seemed for a time lost in some train of thought suggested by her last words. \" Perhaps, what ? What were you going to say ? Oh, Ellen ! if you were to marry now, might I then live with you?\" As she received no answer, she went on as if half speaking to herself: \" That would be very nice ! And Hetty would come and see us sometimes. But she says she is quite determined to marry young,"], [11, "COLLISION. 3 and she wonders at your being still unmarried at your age.\" \"Indeed! So Hetty has settled it all?\" exclaimed Ellen, half-absently, yet amused. \" Yes ; she and I used to talk and settle it all : when I was so very unhappy, she used to tell me to cheer up, for I should soon have a comfortable home, and do just as I liked ; and when I asked her what she meant, she laughed and said she meant to be married. I told her she might not be asked : some people, even pretty people, were not. Then she laughed again, and coloured up, and showed me a ring which was on her finger, and said that was a proof that she had both been asked and had answered.\" \" Very pretty ! And pray who may \" But a loud knock at the street-door interrupted Ellen, and caused Ruth to start up with a brighter face. \" I am sure that is Mr. Vaughan ; he said he should be here about this time.\" \" You seem very fond of him,\" observed Ellen, getting Tip, and then drawing her chair nearer to Ruth's couch. \" To be sure I am. He is the nicest and the dearest man I ever saw. And, Ellen \" she gave a little knowing nod, and smiled, in a way to make poor Ellen's face anything but pale, as it had been ; but whatever joke she was about to utter, was stopped by the entrance of Mr. Vaughan himself. He had been staying with some acquaintance, not very near Poole, but he had made an excuse almost B 2"], [12, "4 EPS AND DOWNS. every day to ride into the town. He and Ruth were sworn allies: he brought her grapes and amusing books ; he told her anecdotes, and managed to chase way her usual timid shyness, so that she always greeted him with a smile of pleasure, and even counted up the hours for his visits. To Ellen, too, his presence had brought comfort ; his reeard for her was so true and so unobtrusive. She bore the slight rallying which her friend Louisa could not quite abstain from, with great sang-froid. Only once had any word or look on his part at all upset her perfect confidence in his \" friendship.\" That once there was a something, not in the words them selves, but in the tone in which they were spoken and in the look and gesture which accompanied them, which had made her conscious and uncomfortable. This, together with Ruth's evident horror of the pro posal to live with her father and stepmother, and her urgent and openly expressed wish that Ellen had a home for her, had given rise to a train of thought which would return almost in spite of herself, and which caused her much trouble. Although she had always confidently sheltered herself under the idea of her \" friendship\" with him, and had more than once denied his even desiring it to be anything else, she knew now that this was not quite true. She began to feel that it rested with herself, and that he struggled hard against his own feelings when he obeyed her. She recalled all her convictions as to Granville's coolness, and asked, if she could ever meet with Mr. Vaughan's"], [13, "COLLISION. 5 equal ? How often did she consider the question now, unconscious how much Ruth's wistful pleading for a home, joined to her own desire for independence, advanced Mr. Vaughan's cause. Then she beo-an to look on it in another way ; saying that it was not right to keep him much longer in suspense : that it was no thing but a phantom \u2014 the ghost of an early idea \u2014 which had come between her and him, and prevented her from appreciating and doing justice to Mr. Vaughan. But now \u2014 now that she saw it was right to give up the old hope, it would be different. She should see Mr. Vaughan with other eyes. She blamed herself for not having sufficiently valued such a faithful and unselfish attachment. His kindness to Ruth, and his fidl and most delicate sympathy, which drew her on to open out her sorrows and fears to him, as perhaps she did to no one else \u2014 all this threw, unconsciously, a far greater encouragement into her manner. Her very hesitation, the sudden checks which she put on herself when most confiding \u2014 the effect of the doubts which were working in her own mind \u2014 all gave him the notion that, at last, his forbearance was reap ing its reward. He saw daylight, and felt a thrill of hope; but he curbed the eager impulse, and carefully abstained from a word or look too much. He could afford to wait still : and Ellen knew almost as little as he did how much Ruth's repeated cry of \" Oh, Ellen, if you had but a home of your own ! \" influenced this train of thought and feeling. \"Are you getting up your French?\" Mr. Vaughan"], [14, "6 UPS AND DOWNS. asked of Ruth, taking up a French story-book from her couch. \" I hate French ! \" she said, with emphasis. He laughed : \" Never mind ; I am sure you can't fail of being amused, as it will be your first introduction to a foreign land. The pretty and lively manners of the people must strike you, as well as their costume ; though perhaps Boulogne is scarcely French enough now, so many of our own people live there. Is it quite settled when you go ? \" \" I believe so,\" sighed Ruth. \" I shouldn't care, if Nelly would come too.\" \"Isn't she \u2014 are you not going then?\" he asked, turning to Ellen. \"No,\" she answered, looking down. \"My last letter from Paris begs me to delay \u2014 in fact, to give up the idea of going there. Mrs. Wentworth finds it necessary to return to London soon : I am to join her there. Ruth is to go next week ; it is quite settled for the present that she and Hetty join my father and Mrs. Raymond. It is thought good for papa to travel a little \u2014 anything, in fact, to amuse him ; and they will remain some time at Boulogne for Bessie's sake, and be all together.\" There was an involuntary touch of bitterness in the last words, which ended in a sad sigh.. \" And you \" \" Meanwhile my friends here are kind enough to offer me house-room,\" she said, abruptly. He did not immediately answer; he turned over"], [15, "7 COLLISION. Ruth's French book rapidly, and as it seemed with nervous fingers. \" Then I shall be in time only to help Mrs. Went worth to set off \u2014 perhaps to escort her, for I know she likes a travelling companion.\" He showed his disappointment hi his manner, and Ellen said it had been proposed for him to take her to Paris. \" She will not need any other escort than the Churches,\" said Ellen, hi a dry, slightly ironical tone, which he at once perceived. \"Ah, then, they are to return with her. Who are these people ? \" \"I don't know. I believe the sister, Miss Church, has been long known to Mrs. Wentworth; but they had lost sight of each other lately. And now it seems the brother, Dr. Church, is a nonpareil,\" laying a stress on the word. \"Isn't he what is called a very religious man? I mean one, who is fond of meethigs, and so on : I am sure the name is famihar.\" \" I believe he is very earnest ; Worthy thinks so. And I believe he is a popular preacher; but I know little of him as yet. I suppose I am destined to become better acquainted.\" Again, the shght touch of bitterness. \" Have you any idea when Mrs. Wentworth returns? Will it be before Christmas ? \" \" No ; certainly not.\" \" Then you will spend Christmas-day here ? \""], [16, "8 UPS AND DOWNS. \" Yes ; I believe so,\" she answered, hi a weary and indifferent tone. He then turned to Ruth, and managed to drive away her fears and her sad looks, for at least the hour he spent there. Ellen spoke but little ; she looked pale and anxious, and her fingers hurriedly and restlessly moved about her pencils or her working things, showing clearly some inward trouble and perplexity. All at once the door opened very suddenly, and, to the surprise of all, Granville Mortimer stood there, his travelling cloak on his arm and his hat in his hand. He looked eagerly round the room, and when he caught sight of Mr. Vaughan, who was a little behind the door, by Ruth's couch, a sudden flush seemed to spread over his face : his step was arrested. \" I beg your pardon,\" he said, stiffly, though at the same time hurriedly, turn ing to Ellen : \" I did not know you were engaged : they told me I should find you here.\" \"And here I am!\" said Ellen, overcoming her shy ness, and trying to receive him with a perfectly free and unconscious manner. She rose and held out her hand as she spoke : \" Do you not remember Ruth ? and that is Mr. Vaughan, \u2014 Mr. Granville Mortimer.\" \"I, at least, remember Mr. Mortimer,\" said the former, with all his natural ease and courteousness ; \" though I dare say, hardly expecting to see me here, he may not so easily recognise me.\" Granville bowed low, and then approached Ruth. But he coidd not so easily command himself, or recover the positive shock of disappointment which the sight"], [17, "COLLISION. 9 of Mr. Vaughan, sitting there as an intimate friend, gave him. At one moment it seemed- that Mr. Vaughan thought of leaving;' but again somethin or checked him, for although he had risen from his seat; and even said something about its being time to think of going, he only moved nearer to Ellen, and spojce to her somewhat in a lower tone, while she knew, though she did not look up, that his eyes . questioned her face. He only spoke of his journey, and asked what he could do for her in Paris ; yet the sound of his low voice, which was purposely pitched for only her ear, and which was touched with that gentle and appealing character which he generally used to her, might well have made Granville believe that they were more than common friends. Granville tried to 'talk to Ruth, but the words came out stiff and cold, and she drew back fearful and shy. Then he came towards the others. \" My time is very short : as you are engaged, I behave I must return to my mother.\" \" When did you come ? I did not know \u2014 I had not heard \" \" No ! I had no time to write,\" he interrupted, abruptly. \" I received a summons which it would be ruin to my prospects not to obey. I merely turned so far out of my route, because I wished so much \u2014 had something to say \u2014 I mean I wished to see my mother.\" There was so much agitation, so much of almost reproach in his eyes, that Ellen coloured, and was relieved at Mr. Vaughan's saying, \" I must go. I will remember all your messages faithfully.\" He was about"], [18, "10 UPS AND DOWNS. to shake hands, when Granville hastily, almost rudely, forestalled hhn by saying, \" Good morning !\" and with out another word, or waiting for Ellen's answer, he hurried out of the room. In another moment they saw him pass the window, walking fast through the drizzling rain, with his cloak still on his arm. Mr. Vaughan had still hold of Ellen's hand: he saw her colour rise and fall, and felt her tremble. \"Your friend seems mighty hurrisome,\" he said, laughingly. \" I always thought Mm one of those well regulated persons whom no chance could upset out of their usual demeanour.\" \" You were very much mistaken,\" she said. And then, finding perhaps that he could not any longer com mand her attention, he left finally ; speaking of their meeting again in London as a matter of course, and returning to re-shake Ruth's hand in his own hearty fashion. The result of this collision between her two visitors was a complete overthrow of all the thoughts she had contrived to string together just before: they were scattered now entirely ; for, full of pain as had been that (on one side) brief, curt, almost angry ' interview, it spoke more to her heart than days of the formal yet reserved kindness she had lately known. She could not but see that he was not only hurt and annoyed at not finding her alone \u2014 for of course he naturally had much to say to her of Bessie and John ; but she also felt, with a throb of pleasure nearly allied to pain, that it was jealousy. That look he had given her told much."], [19, "COLLISION. 11 Poor John's confession had cleared her in the brother's eyes, and his heart was burning to open itself to her. No wonder that the sight of Mr. Vaughan had been as gall and bitterness. Human nature is strange, and made up of a variety of materials ; and, in one sense, we may say of it as a celebrated French author says of happiness: \u2014 \"On se figure que le bonheur est une grosse pierre precieuse. Point du tout : le bon heur c'est une mosaique, composee de mille petites pierres, qui separement et par elles-memes ont peu de valeur, mais qui reunis avee art forment un dessin gracieux.\" And so it was that while Ruth fell back into her dark forebodings and slightly querulous tone, from which in Mr. Vaughan's absence it was difficult to rouse her, Ellen's eves had a brighter light and her voice another sound. But little knew she the feelings of the two men who had so inopportunely jostled each other in life's journey! When, some little time after the visit, she rejoined Louisa, she found her full of regret and even annoyance at Granville's strangely hurried visit. \" Only doing his mother more harm than good, as he ought to have known ! If he could not afford time to stay even a quiet hour, he had better have stayed away, as far as the mother was concerned.\" Ellen resented this blame in her heart, but felt too. conscious to say a word in his defence."], [20, "12 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER II. FRESH DISAPPOINTMENT. Granville entered his old home in a somewhat more noisy manner than was common to him. The heavy, substantial street-door was pushed to with such sudden force, that Miss Mortimer appeared from the drawing room, and with her finger on her lip enforced quiet \u2014 \" for Mrs. Mortimer is sleeping.\" \" You don't say so ! \" he replied, while laying aside his hat and cloak. \"My visits seem to be singularly ill-timed to-day ! And it is coming not a little out of my way, either.\" \" I suppose you are not in such a hurry that you can't wait for half an hour; by which time the nap is sure to be over,\" his sister answered dryly \u2014 for the more \"put out,\" or hot, others were, the colder and more completely calm she always was. \" Were the Cecils asleep too, and the Raymonds ? \" she asked, try ing to catch a glance at his face \u2014 which, however, was hidden in his handkerchief at the moment. He then took up a hat-brush, and proceeded to smooth his ruffled and rain-marked hat, as if willing to continue the conversation in the hall."], [21, "13 FRESH DISAPPOINTMENT. \" They were wide enough awake,\" he replied, care lessly. \" What brings that fellow \u2014 Mr. Vaughan, I mean, to these parts ? Has he any acquaintance here ? \" \" The best of all reasons, I should imagine : that winch seems to lead wise men hoodwinked to every part of the world \u2014 little Dan Cupid, I mean. Why, he is always at Cecils' ! Staying very conveniently in the neighbourhood, but here every day ! \u2014 thinks Poole a sweet, quiet little town: in fact, admires us all exceedingly. He brings grapes to that sick child Ruth : who, by the by, simply wants a good rousing. The Cecils admire him extremely, and, except that both spare rooms are occupied, I really believe Louisa would invite liim to stay there.\" \"The Cecils! Another slang \u2014 or family expres sion ! If you only knew how odd they sound to to \" \" To a crabbed creature ! \" she interrupted, laughing. \" What has unhinged you so, Granville ? Surely it is not seeing Mr. Vaughan\"; with his lady-love ? That is too old a bit of news to overturn you. Besides, I thought \u2014 I understood that the fancy had passed?\" \" Entirely ! you are right. Yet I did not know that matters were come quite so far ; and I had something I particularly desired to say to \u2014 to Miss Raymond. Something too,\" he added, clearing his voice, and hold ing himself more erect, as he went on, \" which I must say to you all. And if the rest are disengaged, I may as well do so at once, while my mother is sleeping.\" He opened the drawing-room door to let his sister"], [22, "14 UPS AND DOWNS. pass with ceremonious politeness, and then followed her into the room, where the other sisters, Anne and Rosamond, sat working. \" I take it for granted,\" he began, in a rather forced and very grave manner, causing his sisters to look up at him, \" that you all heard, or were aware, of some thing amiss, some' estrangement between Bessie and her sister \u2014 I mean Ellen Raymond. You must be aware that she seldom went to their house : that, in fact, she did not like the marriage.\" \" My dear Granville ! excuse me ; but this is surely a subject better buried. The poor girl does seem inclined to amend, and is doing her best to rub out a certain ill impression which we all had of her. Pray, allow her fair play. Don't rake up past follies ! Now, too, that poor John is gone ! \" said Miss Mortimer. \" Unfortunately it was but too well known, as \"well as the reason,\" Anne remarked, at the same time. \" But I am charged \u2014 solemnly charged by John, with his dying lips, to absolve her from all shadow of blame : to say that it was his fault, and his alone,\" Granville said, with a tremor in his voice which belied his set face. . \"I dare say it was in the first instance. I always said that John was one of those men who think it no harm to idly win a girl's affection. No doubt he paid her some attention ; but that won't excuse \" \" Sister, you are wholly mistaken. It was he who loved her passionately \u2014 always ! And when refused, he revenged himself! I need hardly say more now:"], [23, "FRESH DISAPPOINTMENT. 15 you will understand how, and also in what way, it affected her. He urged me to say that the truth was, in fact, just the contrary to what was believed.\" He sat down by Rosamond with a sigh as he ended. Anne pondered on his words, Rosamond eyed him with childish wonder, and then shook her curls, as if tired of trying to make anything of it. But the elder sister's lips curled a little, and her eyebrows were raised incredulously. \" It was generous and self-sacrificing in him to make himself the scapegoat ; but, really, notwithstanding all this, I must be allowed to use my own powers of observation, of hearing, and of judging. Not that I mean to judge her, or visit it upon her, as I said just now. And it is a lesson for all handsome, pleasant men, such as poor John was \" (here there was a little quiver of the lip and a catch in the voice), \" not to trifle with women's hearts.\" He was about to retort, but she left the room rather quickly, and Anne followed her example more leisurely ; Granvflle was therefore left with Rosamond, his favourite sister. He liked making something of a pet of her, and admired her beauty. \"They won't believe it! But if they had heard or seen his anguish and remorse for all the wrong he had done her \u2014 ! \" \" Nothing so very bad after all, was it ? \" she put in, playfully. \" John always made himself rather par ticular, you know ; and he was very, very good-looking. And poor Bessie was such a poor, dear old dowdy.\""], [24, "16 UPS AND DOWNS. \" Hush ! Rosy,\" he said, twisting her curls round his finger. \"You don't know \u2014 I hope you never will, all the misery a misplaced, and unreturned love may be It is a sad story, an awful story. But you must bear in mind \u2014 do you hear ? \u2014 and always be sure that what I say is truth \u2014 that Ellen Raymond was blameless with regard to John : she never cared for him, she was blameless alto gether ; except, perhaps, in rejecting too harshly his love. She has been bitterly used! and sorely was it repented at last ! Such moments, such hours ! \" He hid his eyes for a moment, as if to shut out some painfid sight. \" And, Rosy, \u2014 never, never give back words of scorn for offered love ! You don't know what a man suffers before he offers his heart. Feeling the uncertainty, that's bad enough; but to be received with contumely, scorn \" \" I dare say ! But you \u2014 none of you \u2014 care how many hearts you break ! You have all the best of it : u-e must bear and be silent.\" \" You have it in your power to say \u2014 yes or no. It is a fearful power, Rosy.\" \" I do believe, Gran, you must be in love yourself: or do all poets necessarily know so much about it ? By the by, do you care at all for Ellen Raymond ? Do you think her so very beautiful, as some do ? \" \"I think her beautiful: and as to 'caring' about her, surely you remember that she and I and Bessie were playfellows; and she is Bessie's sister. Don't you Idee her, yourself? \""], [25, "FRESH DISAPPOINTMENT. 17 \" Toi de rol, as little Lisa used to say : but she is very high, and, in fact, not in my line.

At least, Louisa didn't say so, though she confessed it was sure to end that way.

She had learnt to prize his caresses, and did not \"snub\" him, as formerly she thought it incumbent on her to do. The interview between the son and mother was c vol. ni."], [26, "18 UPS AND DOWNS. calm; though, on her side, tearful. She had long learnt, to her, the difficult lesson of controlling her feelings \u2014 all except a few tears; and these now fell on Granville's hand, which she fondly touched, and stroked, and then kissed. To her, after answering many questions which her mother's heart yearned to know, he repeated, though in a different way, John's confession and absolution of Ellen. It upset her a good deal ; but she expressed great pity and affection for Ellen. \"She is a dear girl, Granville; so much improved, too ! \" and she looked wistfully and inquiringly at him. \" Is she improved, or is it the gdding ? An heiress is generally thought perfection.\" \" My dear, if anything, one might expect to see her a little more set up, and so on ; but I assure you, she is \u2014 at least all that I see of her \u2014 very amiable and gentle, and so kind to an old woman.\" As he did not answer, she presently said, \" But, surely, you saw this for yourself, when you were in the same house ? Dichi't you find her improved ? \" \" Perhaps so. I suppose this is her last visit here as Miss Raymond?\" \" Indeed ! Oh, yes, I [did hear the girls say there was some person \u2014 but I did not believe it. Some how \u2014 I believe \u2014 I thought \u2014 didn't you yourself have a fancy for her at one time ? \" \" A ' fancy ? ' No, mother, no ! The sooner such a 'fancy' on your part, or any one's, is done away"], [27, "FRESH DISAPPOINTMENT. 19 with the better. It is a foolish thing to be coupling people together, especially when they are remotely connected, so as to render frequent intercourse pro bable : very foolish ! \" \" It is, my dear ; and I often say so to the girls : but people will talk, you know ! \" \" Yes, . ' The world, when men and women meet, Is rich in sage remark,' \" said Granville ; and after a little more conversation, partly about his own prospects, and partly about the poor young widow, he was obliged to take leave, promising to try hard to spend Christmas at home. Nothing could be kinder than the letters which came now and then to Ruth from her stepmother. She always addressed her as her child, and signed herself her affectionate mother. Hetty was already there, and she offered a cordial welcome to Ruth. It seemed as if she opened her arms to all her husband's children save one. For Ellen there were only formal, stately words: she was evidently ex cluded from the family. But it was her own choice, after all ; as she repeated to herself, when feeling more than commonly hurt at it. Colonel Raymond's health improved ; but it was a very distressing state \u2014 without memory or power of recognition. His mind was gone, and at times he was wretchedly depressed : he needed constant amusement and change. Bessie said, in a short note to Ellen, c 2"], [28, "20 UPS AND DOWNS. written after her first seeing him thus changed, that nothing could exceed his wife's constant, untiring devotion. Ruth was sent off with her own old nurse, to whom Mrs. Raymond had written a condescending request to consent to live again in the family, and to attend upon her late charges as their peculiar servant. No fault could be found with the arrangements. But Ruth's sad and clinging kisses left Ellen forlorn, in spite of the real and true kindness of her hosts. She was, as she had told Mr. Vaughan she expected to be, at Poole for Christmas. She had received a letter from Gran ville, telling her, what Mr. Vaughan's presence on that day had prevented his then saying, all that John had left him to say to her. He added not a word on his own account: he evidently considered himself as his brother's messenger or mouthpiece. He did not say a word of remark on this intelligence: he merely and briefly stated the fact. Yet, wdiile tears of pity came at poor John's late remorse and justice, Ellen felt a great relief, and looked forward to meeting Granville at Christmas with more pleasure than she dared quite realize. It was with proportionate disappointment, therefore, that she found him reserved and distant as ever when they did meet at the Bank House. Yet more than once, during that evening, she looked up suddenly and met his eyes fixed on hers \u2014 not altogether in disapproving displeasure either, she thought : once, too, when she made a great effort to speak freely to him \u2014 to refer to"], [29, "FRESH DISAPPOINTMENT. 21 his opinion, she was conscious of a peculiar light in his face, which made her cheeks burn. Why was he so grave and sad ? She heard him sigh often when he was talking to Rosamond ; and his sister in vain rallied him on the subject. It was remarked by all, that Ellen Raymond looked particularly well that evening \u2014 that her rich, soft black silk, falling in long and rounded folds, unbroken by frill or flounce, was espe cially becoming. Her bright hair caught the light in every ripple and every turn of the thick braids; and there was a hesitating, subdued softness, unusual to her, which added a great charm. All the sisters were loud in praise of her beauty when she had gone home with Cecil, leaving Louisa to take the next turn of the chair. Granville did not enter into the group of talkers ; he was pacing to and fro ! till something that his sister-in-law said, caused him to stay his walk and listen intently, though he still kept aloof. \" I am sure of it ; for she told me so herself. There can be no doubt of his feelings and wishes ; but I am not quite so sure as to her, after all. At all events, they are not engaged; she said they were only friends.\" This brought something like a laugh, and they soon separated, as the chair was again announced."], [30, "22 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER III. THOUGHTS IN A SNOW-STORM. It was snowing fast, and the white flakes were blackened even as they fell hi the dim and dirty square. Ellen sighed and shivered as she replenished her fire, and looked around her London room. It was as comfortable as it could be made, certainly ; and here she sat by far the greater part of the day, drawing or trying to draw, or sewing : or, it must be owned, very often sitting with her arms on the table, and her thoughts in dreamland. She had joined her friend Mrs. Wentworth a few days shice, and found her very much excited at having at last gained a long-pending lawsuit; which business had, indeed, been the chief cause for inducing her to cross the Channel in such cold weather, and ex change the pleasures of Paris for London. There was quite a new \"stir\" about her; a restless activity and excitement that Ellen had never before seen! Her new, or, as she called them, \" old,\" friends the Churches were with her ; and Ellen had not been in the house two . hours without discovering that they had, to use a vulgar saying, measured her foot, and"], [31, "THOUGHTS IN A SNOW-STORM. 23 had acquired unbounded influence over her impres sible, versatile mind. They had found her in low spirits, and out of health, her mind uneasy and disturbed. Dr. Church was a zealous and energetic apostle of his own peculiar creed, and seized the occasion. Between his forcible, downright, and yet persuasive preaching, arguments, and writings, and his sister's gentle and persistent flattery, they had roused the woman of the world, and, hi their own phraseology, \" converted\" her. She received Ellen lovingly, and declared she was charmed to have a pretty face to look at, and a well toned voice to listen to (Miss Church had neither). She was eager to bring her also to her own ecstatic state of admiration of the Doctor ; gave her heaps of tracts and works on the prophecies, and made her accompany her to meetings and preachings. Ellen was surprised and somewhat glad at this change: she had long desired an awakening from what she feared was a dangerous sleep ; but she could not quite enter into the spirit of the party which Mrs. Wentworth had joined. She preferred Doctor Edgeworth, and thought of Mr. Damer with pleasure, in contrast to all she now saw and heard. Perhaps she might have felt somewhat piqued at being now comparatively of so little importance \u2014 Mrs. Wentworth being so wholly occupied that Ellen might absent herself for hours without notice being taken. But she was herself preoccupied; and desired nothing better than to be in her room, at liberty to"], [32, "24 UPS AND DOWNS, sit and think. It was a curious sort of thinking, after all ! On this January morning her thoughts were at Poole. She recalled her last and farewell visit to Mrs. Mortimer, and went over all she had said. Curiously, the conversation had fallen almost entirely on her son Granville. Mrs. Mortimer had been full of him \u2014 of his boyhood, his character, his abilities. She declared that he was not known generally ; that no one save herself was aware what a deep heart he had \u2014 how needful love was to him. Then she had spoken of his prospects, saying that each of her sons had a small independence ; not enough to live and marry upon, but a comfortable addition to the income they might make for themselves. Granville's had been so well managed by Cecil that it had increased ; for he, Granville, was always prudent \u2014 different from poor John, whose tastes had been rather beyond his means ! She had regretted Granville's not accepting the church preferment, which might have been his ; but was quite sure that, with his abilities, and good, steady character, he could always maintain himself: even marry, without any imprudence. And she had earnestly desired to see \" that \" take place before she died ; had paid a passing tribute of praise to her present daughter-in-law, and then said she was sure to be pleased with Granville's choice : of all men he most needed a wife and a home. She had said this without looking at Ellen ; and had added that any woman might consider herself blessed in such a husband as he was sure to make. \" A good"], [33, "THOUGHTS IN A SNOW-STORM. 25 son and brother is always sure to be a good husband,\" she had said. Didn't Ellen think so ? \" He is so ex tremely attached to dear Bessie,\" she went on ; \" in fact, he is, and has been always, very fond of your family.\" Then suddenly she had turned to Ellen's own situa tion, and apologised for never having congratulated her on being an heiress. But she did in her heart doubt, if that added really to a woman's happiness ! It was so apt to shut them in ; for some men \u2014 the best kind per haps \u2014 did not like to owe wealth to a wife ; and some w*e resensitive and proud ;\u2014 afraid that their purity of intention might be doubted. .Some men dreaded being talked of as marrying for money. It also brought many mercenary characters to assume love, and so forth : and then, after all, riches were a great responsibility! To which Ellen had assented. Finally she had left with a wondering mind why Mrs. Mortimer should have talked to her so, and thinking what was the motive which induced her to give such a loving, hearty, motherly kiss ! \u2014 and what brought that tender, wistful look in her eyes ! \u2014 so like \u2014 so very like, what Granville's could be. That soft, impressive pressure from the small, thin hand ! She felt it now ! It was very sweet : and the broken tone in which she had said, \" God bless you, my dear child ! I shall see you agam ere long : I am sure of it. You and J must not be strangers. You will forgive an old woman's \u2014 a mother's garrulity ? \" All this now brought a pleasant thought to Ellen, and she ceased to care for the dismal look-out at the dirty"], [34, "26 UPS AND DOWNS. snow. She forgot the dinner party which she had dreaded so much \u2014 a regular reunion of the Churches' friends. And again she went over Christmas-tide in fancy. It had been, of course, spent very quietly at Poole ; and the attempt at the usual family gathering had been, as it always must be, a very great pain. At such times, the vacant chairs, the absence of familiar faces and voices, bring home what it is to mourn for the dead. Yet out of principle \u2014 for the Mortimers thought it a sin to give way ; and except the black dresses, no one could have guessed their loss or secret sorrow \u2014 there were constant meetings at the Bank House and at Cecil's cottage. And although the intercourse between herself and Granville was outwardly more distant than perhaps it had ever been, there was something in the look which she felt followed her whenever they were in the same room, and in the hurried, nervous manner with which he offered her the common daily greetings \u2014 so very different from his stately coldness \u2014 that prevented her from feeling utterly thrown back and chilled, as often she had been. She thought (and hked him the better for it) that he was unhappy at the remembrance of his brother's death ; that though it had cleared her in his sight from much wrong, he naturally lamented and mourned over his brother's sins. Also the thought did once or twice cross her \u2014 it was roused by some chance words from others \u2014 that the rumour of her future fortune estranged h m. He of all men, she well knew, would abhor the"], [35, "27 THOUGHTS IN A SNOW-STORM. idea of courting an heiress ; and this induced her to exert herself, so that she even sought an opportunity of addressing him. If he would only return to old days, if they could but fall into some unrestrained, intimate talk, she was sure this barrier must fall from betwixt them ! But though he even started, and a look of bright plea sure came to his face at being spoken to by her, he did not go on ; he soon fell into sdence, as if thinking of other things \u2014 even appeared shy and nervous, and answered at random : and this threw her back. So it went on for all the days he spent there. It was excit ing \u2014 tantalizing \u2014 provoking ! Then she did hope, in spite of Mrs. Wentworth's prejudice, that they might sometimes meet in London. He would be freer there ; for he was one always to be most shy and ill at ease before his own family. Although neither of them could enter into general society in their deep mourning, there might be many chances of meeting, at least \u2014 if he chose it. If \u2014 ? This was the fourth day of her being in town, and when she looked out on the snow, and felt that it was not weather for any one to venture out who was not obliged to do so, a feeling of disappointment had crept over her. He knew she was there : if he had wished it, he might have called. Yes ; in spite of Mrs. Wentworth's cold reception at Blair, he might have made some excuse to call on her ! But the day wore on and on, and there was no"], [36, "28 UPS AND DOWNS. summons for her. Just before it was time to dress for dinner, she sauntered listlessly into the drawing room. Mrs. Wentworth was resting on a couch, and Miss Church was reading to her; she stopped when Ellen entered, and gave a look of unconcealed supe riority and pity, which made Ellen assume a little of her old haughtiness of manner. \" Don't let me interrupt you, pray,\" Ellen said. \" Well, it is very nice, very good ; but I am rather tired, dear Miss Church : if you don't object, we will finish it to-morrow,\" said Mrs. Wentworth. \" It is beautifully written, Ellen love. You must positively read it : do you hear ? \" But Ellen was occupied, and did not hear. She was looking at several visiting cards, which had lately been laid on the table. \" The Rev. John Peter,\" \" Lady Constantia Somers,\" \" The Rev. Isaac Sympson,\" plenty of Reverends, and several Misses ; quite new names on Mrs. Wentworth's visiting list. Amongst them all was one which she held after dropping the others : \" Mr. G. E. Mortimer ! When did he come ? \" \" Who ? Oh, Mr. Mortimer, I suppose the writer ? \u2014 I gave a general order to say I was engaged, wishing to keep myself quiet for this evening, and I know how you hate morning visitors.\" \" Nevertheless, I should hke to have seen him. He might have had some message,\" Ellen said, annoyed out of shyness. \" He has not been to Poole, has he ? What message can he have, Lena ? Besides, dear child, since I Avished"], [37, "THOUGHTS IN A SNOW-STORM. 29 for quiet, where could you have seen him? for you know Dr. Church has the dining-room.\" \" Never mind, it does not signify,\" Ellen said, recovering herself, and coming up in her usual fashion to fondle her friend. \"Ah, my dear, I was saying to our good friend here, how I wished you to sympathize with us : vou who \" \" Am I so unsympathizing ? \" interrupted Ellen, playfully, yet fondly. \" Ah, my love, I never used to think of these things : the world, the world, \u2014 that was all. And you, who will have the same means which I have so wrongly neglected, \u2014 Ellen ! you must make amends \u2014 do you hear?\" Ellen's answer was a loving kiss and pressure of the delicate hand lying on her arm. \" Who is coming this evening, Worthy ? \" she asked presently, when they were alone together. \" Some excellent people, Dr. Church's best friends. He is to read us his new pamphlet, on 'Prophecy Fulfilled.' How nicely you look, Lena. After all, black is certainly very becoming to you ; and it is unfortunate that this provoking mourning should be so deep as to prevent you from appearing in society.\" \" Oh, but what would Miss Church say ? \" Ellen asked, wickedly. \" Nothing ; she knows that a certain position entails certain duties. We must in a measure mix with the world, in order to do good. So Miss Raymond cut"], [38, "30 UPS AND DOWNS. a good figure and astonished the good folks at Poole, eh ? Ah ! a httle bird came and whispered how much my child was admired, and so forth. No ; you won't guess : no ; it was not Edward Vaughan. By the way, Lena, you have gratified me beyond measure. He came to me in Paris, another man ! I am sure he deserves to w*in. If I can only see you both favoured as I have been, and true believers, there will be nothing more to wish for.\" Ellen's colour rushed into her face, and she was about to say something in a very eager way, when Watkins appeared, sharper and crosser than ever, to summon her mistress to her toflette. Poor Watkins, who had during her long reign in her mistress's dressing-room so jealously resisted intimate friends, was sorely perplexed and vexed at this new invasion. Her whole nature rose hi opposition to Miss Church, from the cut of her petticoat to her cotton gloves. She was an impersonation of bad taste in Watkins' eyes ; and the wholesale and thorough way in which reform and new rules were urged in the habits of her mistress, roused her utmost indignation : so much so, that she positively looked to the once dreaded Ellen as an ally, and sought by word and look to convey her horror at the way in which they treated \" poor dear missis ! \""], [39, "31 CHAPTER IV. ABOUT SUNDRY THINGS. Dr. Church had just finished reading aloud his MS. to an admiring audience. And now in the buzz, which was the natural consequence of a long silence, Ellen had time and leisure to smfle inwardly at the complete contrast which this party offered to all others. Mrs. Wentworth, who so shuddered at a lady's party, to be the head of this, in which there were but three gentlemen to a round half-dozen females ! To her surprise, Ellen found herself a subject of interest and attention ; and she was at a loss to discover why, till Miss Church let fall an allusion to her \"great prospects,\" which had the effect of silencing her immediately. In the very midst of the evening a servant opened the door wide, and announced Mr. Mortimer \u2014 a self invited guest, deeming he should find them alone. How inopportune ! How very unlucky ! Ellen felt. And yet only that morning she had been expecting and hoping to see him. She felt Mrs. Wentworth's cold bow, and Miss Church's look through her spectacles, and dared not herself stir a step."], [40, "32 UPS AND DOWNS. \" I did not know \u2014 the servant gave me no hint of this,\" Granville soon whispered low in her ear, as he took a seat a little behind her. \" Is that the celebrated Dr. Church? \"he added. \" Is he celebrated ? \" \" In a certain way, and within a certain circle, un doubtedly, yes. As a preacher he is much sought : but not one I should have expected to meet here,\" he added, smiling. \" Ah ! ' nous avons change tou tcela,' she rejoined. \" My friend has been impressed with Dr. Church's preaching, and she is not one to do things by halves, ever.\" But there was a move, and a request for music, responded to by Mrs. Wentworth's playing on her harp. Ellen was amused to see the efforts made by one and all the party, one after the other, to draw out the stranger \u2014 the silent man, as he was called. But all in vain : he maintained his reserve ; yet with a certain dignity and ease, which made Ellen feel rather proud of her old friend. In the course of the evening he sang ; and then Ellen triumphed, for Mrs. Wentworth's knowledge of music forbade her affecting indifference. She was fairly delighted, and said so ; although it was utterly unappreciated by Dr. Church and Co., who remarked that to him a little hymn sung in an infant school, by some score or two of babies, was far more pleasing than the best and finest performance.\" \" Do sing the Venetian thing which my father liked,\" Ellen,ventured to plead, as he was rising from his seat : he having accompanied himself."], [41, "ABOUT SUNDRY THINGS. 33 Immediately and without a comment he complied. \" I imagined you did not like this song,\" he said, when it was over. \" That evening \" \" Yes; I liked the song, but \" \" I understand,\" he said, hurriedly, and stooping over the music book. \" But,\" he added, in a low but clear voice, \" now you know how I was deceived, can you ever forgive it? \" \" It was not your fault,\" she answered, feeling strangely excited. \" Partly it was. I ought to have asked yourself, or I might have trusted.\" \" No ! But don't talk of that. It was like a horrible dream ; and if I sometimes bear to recall it, it is only to know I am awake, and that it is gone.\" \" Come, good people, I am thirsting for more delicious music,\" cried Mrs. Wentworth. \" Ellen, persuade your friend to give us another.\" \" You will yourself help me,\" he answered, and placing a duet on the stand as he spoke \u2014 one which they had often sung together. He arose for her to play the accompaniment, but she declined, and shyly begged him to do so. Again he seated himself, and not only played, but so covered all her weak parts and unfinished notes, that she regained confidence, and it came off \" famously,\" as Mrs. Wentworth said. Under the influence of music, and under cover of the general conversation, Ellen ventured to remark that Granville was not looking well, and he owned he had been sitting up at night too much. > > VOL. III. d"], [42, "34 UPS AND DOWNS. Was it fancy, she asked herself afterwards, or was there really a pressure \"over and above,\" when he wished her good-night \u2014 suddenly saying he must go at once, but hoping to see her again very shortly. His mother spoke of his studying at night, Ellen was thinking, when she was startled by a cry, \" She has fainted ;\" and then there was a rush and a panic, no one remembering what to do. Mrs. Wentworth had sunk back again when attempting to rise from her chair, as if with a sudden spasm of pain. Her breath came quick and gasping, and in a moment she had sainted. Ellen summoned Watkins, who dispersed the crowd; and muttering, she \" knew how it would be, well enough, for all this talking and exciting was more than her lady could bear,\" she carried her away to her own room. Although peremptorily dismissed by Watkins, Ellen was at last summoned by Mrs. Wentworth's orders, who said it soothed her to hold Ellen's hand, and promising with her sweet smile not to talk at all. During that watch Ellen took home a conviction that her friend was much changed, and she blamed herself severely for not seeing it before. Henceforth she would keep her own place and watch her more, unmoved by petty jealousy of Miss Church. All the love and the tenderness she had enjoyed returned with full force; and she internally resolved to devote herself more entirely to this dear and best friend, and to let nothing come between them."], [43, "ABOUT SUNDRY THINGS. 35 As Mrs. Wentworth remained pale and fragile after several days, Ellen longed to return to Blair, feeling with Watkins that all the excitement and bustle which the Churches lived in, was very bad for her. But they dared not to urge anything touching on her health, it so upset and excited Mrs. Wentworth ; even the mention of sending for a doctor made her hysterical. She struggled again at her weakness, and insisted on receiving visitors and dressing for dinner. But Ellen's anxious eyes could not be deceived, even by all the various appliances used to hide the ravages of illness. She was unhappy and anxious about Mrs. Wentworth, and annoyed more and more at the whirl of busy bustle which Miss Church brought, even to the quiet and once strictly guarded dressing-room. But Mrs. Wentworth allowed her to rule, answering Ellen's remonstrances with, \" Ah, my love, I have neglected religion too late ! I am weak in body, but I must make up and redeem the time ; and you, Ellen, my child, my successor, won't you give heed in time ? \" she often cried. A clear hard frost had succeeded to the snow and sleet. It was an agreeable change, but Mrs. Went worth did not seem to benefit by it, as had been hoped. She looked ill, and was restless and depressed. She was kept in a state of perpetual excitement ; and there were daily meetings carried on in her own room with the Churches and one or two of their friends, from which Ellen was jealously excluded. D 2"], [44, "36 UPS AND DOWNS. Ellen continued to admire Dr. Church, and to a certain extent like him, though she could not believe in his peculiar tenets. But towards his sister, she imbibed one of those unaccountable dislikes so well expressed by the old couplet about a certain Dr. Fell. Mrs. Wentworth saw it, and accused Ellen of uncharit ableness and prejudice. How could she dislike so good and conscientious a woman, one so active in helping others, so truly pious ? \" You need not be jealous of her, Lena, for though I value her friendship and respect her highly, she can never, never take your place, you know.\" \" I wish I could think she did you any good, but it always seems to me you are worse, and quite worn out, after one of your long tete-a-tetes with her,\" said Ellen. But then Mrs. Wentworth repeated her assurance that it was all for her good : and Ellen tried to be satisfied. She was, however, excessively glad to welcome Mr. Vaughan, who took them by surprise, and returned from Paris a month before he was ex- pected. He gave as a reason for this hasty move, that his niece's gaiety fairly knocked him up. He was pining for the quiet of Thorn Hall, so he packed up in time to escape one of the crowds he so much disliked, namely, a large ball given by Captain and Mrs. Nevile. \" I am so glad you are come ! \" Ellen said. \" Are you ? Are you, indeed ?\" \" Yes ; for I really want you to influence Mrs. Went worth. You are the only person in the wide world"], [45, "ABOUT SUNDRY THINGS. 37 likely to have a chance against these people. She is fairly killing herself.\" \" Indeed ! \" he said, in a somewhat disappointed tone. \" But it is too fine to be shut up here. Come with me and see the skating on the Serpentine, and then I will hear all your grief. I suppose by ' these people,' I am to understand the learned Doctor whose acquaintance she made in Paris. He was preaching there in the Protestant Church, and made a great stir. Very singular that she \u2014 that Mrs. Wentworth should have been bitten ! The very last thing I expected of her.\" \u2022Ellen was soon ready, and they set off arm-in-arm. \" Do you think him a good man? Is he earnest, or mere claptrap ? \" Mr. Vaughan asked, as she men tioned Dr. Church's name.' \" Oh, I think he's earnest, certainly. Though rather narrow and one-sided. But it is the sister who does the harm \u2014 if harm it is.\" \" Ah ! I did not take to her at all. I can fancy exactly what she is. Fancy poor Mrs. Wentworth a victim to one of that description ! \" \" It isn't that one can be sorry to see her touched, to find her inclined to think more seriously, but this does hardly seem quite wholesome. There is such a bustle and fuss, so much, as it seems to me, of the world mixed up in it.\" \" The religious world. Yes ; there are many phases of this same world, or mammon. But here is Mr. Mortimer, surely ! We seem destined to cross each other's orbits at all events ! \" Mr. Vaughan said, laughing."], [46, "38 UPS AND DOWNS. It was Granville. He was on his way to call on Mrs. Wentworth, he said. \" Give your card to us then, and save yourself the shady side of the Square,\" said Mr. Vaughan. \" We are bound to the skating,\" he went on, pleasantly. \" Can't you join us ? \" \" Thank you,\" looking at his watch \u2014 \" I have hardly the time to spare.\" \"What! not now that your intended visit is pre vented?\" Ellen said. \"It is a duty to walk on such a day. We don't get many such.\" He turned with them ; but at first neither he nor Ellen seconded Mr. Vaughan's attempts at conversation. Valorously he rattled on, yet it was not rattling either ; it was too easy, too genial. He did not wait for answers. He described parties in Paris, public improvements, and then went to operas. At last, happening to allude to a certain pass in the Pyrenees which, in his travels years ago, had been the scene of an adventure, Gran ville dropped his coat of mail, and having himself visited the spot, they compared notes. Granville spoke of a sketch he had of it, and Mr. Vaughan begged to be allowed to see it. Would Mr. Mortimer let him call that evening? Though no draughtsman himself, he was fond of looking at sketches. \" This evening ? \" said Ellen ; \" surely you are not going to run away and desert us this evening ! \" \" Isn't there to be a party ? I think I heard so. And, really, I can't exactly face a whole lot of Churches, you know.\""], [47, "ABOUT SUNDRY THINGS. 39 \"Yes, there is to be a party: just why I wanted you,\" she answered, in a doleful voice. The walk was a pleasant one. While they stood to look at the gay scene, Mr. Vaughan, meeting an acquaintance, left the other two together. Ellen was asking if he ever skated now, remembering one winter at Poole some feats performed by him and his brothers, but he did not hear her ; he spoke hurriedly, and not in his usual clear voice : \" It seems that I never can, never am to find a time to speak to you ! Yet you must have wondered that I could find nothing to say but that bare statement. I tore up several sheets of paper; and at last confined myself to giving the message without comment. At Poole I wished to see you, but perhaps I managed badly; and in a large family party, it is not easy to say a word in private. Now, however, for I shall probably never find a better time, let me say what is only due to you. Let me withdraw all those censorious and unjust speeches I made ! Say \u2014 that is, if you can say so sincerely \u2014 that you will forgive and try to forget. I hardly think it is taxing your generous temper too much ! \" \" Surely \u2014 can you doubt it ?\" she said, much moved. \" And then there is something else I wanted to say, but I see, he \u2014 Mr. Vaughan, is coming back (I am sure I ought to beg his pardon, I am a sad bungler in his path).\" This was spoken in parenthesis, and with a stiff bitterness. He did not notice her expression of surprise as she repeated \u2014 \" Beg his pardon ! \" \" What I want to say,\" he went on, eagerly, \" what"], [48, "40 UPS AND DOWNS. I wish you to know is, that poor John did seem tho roughly penitent and sorry, that he drew towards his wife so much at the last. You ought to know how com pletely he did you justice, and exonerated you ! Bessie will never, at least I think not, allude to it. It was the most touching thing I ever saw to witness her bitter sorrow. But this you can imagine for yourself You know how she loved him ! and then to have all her faith destroyed, to know he had never loved her! But I am wrong to say all this now. I wish I could talk to you freely about it \u2014 about her ! but it will never be, I suppose. And \u2014 forgive my touching on such a subject at such an unsuitable moment, but \u2014 but \u2014 I cannot reckon on seeing you again !\" \" Why so ? We don't leave for a few days, perhaps a week,\" she said, gently but quickly. \" Well, I may chance a call then ; but I shall be sure to stumble in when least wanted ! And the fact is, I believe I am going abroad directly. A very advantageous offer has been made me, and I have already written to accept. If my condition is allowed, I shall be off' in three days. I shall be at first at Munich, and then, when warmer weather comes, go on towards Russia. So you see \u2014 you understand the reason of my seeming impropriety ? \" She did not answer \u2014 she could not. For one moment all power of speech was gone. She almost felt as if the earth was sliding from under her. \"You will be chilled with standing here. Let us move on,\" he said, observing her paleness. \"I will"], [49, "ABOUT SUNDRY THINGS. 41 take you to \u2014 to your friend, who seems to pick up numerous acquaintances, and then I must say good morning, or good-bye, as perhaps it may be, for my allowance of time is expired.\" She took his arm, her hand trembled a little, and again he said she had caught cold. Mr. Vaughan came towards them with a friend, whom he bego-ed to introduce to Ellen. Granville shook her hand, and said \" Good morning.\" In another moment he was not to be seen, for he threaded his way quickly among the thick crowd. Ellen shivered, and looked so pale that Mr. Vaughan insisted on returning at once. But she soon recovered. Pride was strong within her, and her companion had no cause to complain of her silence or coldness. She talked and laughed, and was full of the cheerful scene and bright day when she returned, trying to cheer up Mrs. Wentworth. As usual, her morning with Miss Church had left her tired, but to-day there was something more, and at last, after striving to keep it in, she burst into tears. \" I can't bear it, it is too horrible,\" she said. \" They have been telling me that it is my duty to send for my lawyer and make my will directly, hinting that my health is uncertain, and so on. Such horrible ideas! I do believe Miss Church is afraid I shall forget my promise to leave some money to her infant-school, but I told her if I did forget that, you would act for me.\" And Mrs. Wentworth laughed hysterically, and finally had a regular attack\u2014 so bad that the expected party was put off, to Ellen's comfort."], [50, "42 UPS AND DOWNS. \" I wish we were out of it all, \u2014 at home,\" Ellen exclaimed to Watkins. \" 'Twill be all as bad there, miss. That place is made up of unpleasant ideas to my lady. The only one thing to save her from fretting herself really ill, is to go to Italy. I know if we had gone there, she would have been well before this. But my words will be remembered when 'tis too late.\" Ellen sat for some time that night by her friend's bedside. The light was shaded, so that they could not see each other's faces clearly. But Mrs. Wentworth was inclined to talk ; she played fondly with Ellen's hair, drawing her head on to the bed. \" It would be such a comfort, such a relief to me, Lena, to know you were safe. Let me say what I wish now, it doesn't hurt me; but except with me, what home, what shelter have you ? Where, my dear child, in all the world could you find one in every way more worthy? \u2014 one who is so really, genuinely good, where true attachment is proved beyond all doubt ? How do I know, you ask ? \u2014 That is nonsense. Of course, I know ! He talks so to me, and only curbs his wishes by my desire ; and also, Lena, you must know it is no light thing for a man to confess such feelings \u2014 to ask and to offer so much without some certainty of success. It is a serious thing ; he is no boy ; this is his one and only love, I do believe. He stakes everything on it ; but he is growing impatient \u2014 also a little hopeful. You start at this, but I ask you, why should he not ? Ask yourself, Ellen, if Mr. Mor-"], [51, "43 ABOUT SUNDRY THINGS. timer had meant anything, has he not had opportunities and time ? All that time at Brighton \u2014 again at Poole \u2014 again here. \u2014 What do you say? That he has been unlucky ? That would be no hindrance. No ! I assure you I am quite relieved, quite happy, because I respect him much more for his sense ; he sees it is out of the question.\" \"Rather, he feels I am not good enough: he is severe, critical ! \" Ellen said, raising her head, but only to bury it again. \" Let him be ; it is an odious character. Could such a disposition make you happy ? Oh, Ellen, Ellen ! it is not like you \u2014 it is not, indeed. Where is your pride ? to cherish perversely a mere fancy \u2014 a dream, a memory, which would, I am quite sure, be dust and ashes in your hand. I repeat, it is not like you, to care for any one, unwooed.\" \" Worthy,\" she exclaimed, \" you go too far ! \" \" Well, I will say no more : only reflect, ask your self what encouragement have you had ? \u2014 If it is only because of this one idea, if this is really all that pre vents you from duly appreciating Edward Vaughan, I must say you are wrong, and you will repent ; you will indeed ! Ellen ! hear me, I am in earnest ! I know \u2014 I feel \u2014 you will never marry Granville Mortimer.\" Ellen shivered a little, for she recalled John's words. It was very painful to hear all this and to have nothing tangible to set against it.

It would be a poor return to Mr. Vaughan!\" \" It is only perversity, a mere absurd crotchet,\" returned Mrs. Wentworth, with some temper. \" Take care, or you will be left in the lurch. At all events you know my mind. I can say nothing more.\""], [53, "45 CHAPTER V. A CRISIS. Havino ascertained that Miss Church had gone out for the day, Ellen took her pencils to the drawing-room, which afforded the best light for drawing. She had just finished a sketch of the cove at Ashby Cross \u2014 the favourite old haunt of former days. Being in that mood when memory responds quicker to sadness than to joy, the associations coimected with this wild spot were not very cheering : and Mrs. Wentworth's words on the previous night had greatly depressed her. She had followed her advice and \" reflected ; \" and the con sequence was, that she agreed with her friend so far, that if he had chosen, and wished it, Granville Mortimer might have found abundant opportunity to renew their old intercourse. He had not done so ; he kept aloof from her. It was, therefore, due to her maiden pride and dignity to think no more of the past \u2014 of that past he had himself consigned to oblivion. It was strange, perhaps, that no thought of Mr. Vaughan crossed her mind on this morning. As she put in here a touch and there a touch, and contemplated the effect, she brushed aside several tears, for she was bent on"], [54, "46 UPS AND DOWNS. judging herself severely. This was the last, the very last time she would allow herself \"to go over it all, from the very beginning to the end ! \" And the draw ing before her was a great help. It was there, on that rock, that they had met as boy and girl. There, afterwards, when older, he had confided his ambitious dreams to her ears. There, many a word and many a look had passed, which she had taken for unchangeable truth. Mrs. Wentworth said that every one had just such a phase in life, but that it never came to any thing. Men were sure to outlive such youthful fancies; and women, too, lived to laugh at them, or speak of them as a tale that is told ! Ellen questioned herself \u2014 Had she by word or look given him reason to imagine that her memory was better than his ? \u2014 that what was nothing to him, was of any consequence to her ? No : she believed, and was thankful to believe, she had not ! Then, she must turn her back on it all and never again look back till she was hardened. She must don a mask, and play a part. Hundreds did so, and so could she. But the tears came fast and her heart throbbed, as the remembrance of a look or a tone, once or twice lately, \u2014 even yesterday, at the skating, \u2014 came before her! What did it mean? Nothing! o Nothing ! Just then a step was heard on the stairs. Could it be Mr. Vaughan? No; he was gone. He said he should start early this very morning. He had wished them good-bye last evening, coming on purpose, after visiting Mr. Mortimer's rooms, full of admiration for \" that fellow's sketches ; \" and he had"], [55, "47 A CRISIS. said, \" Well, if you don't return home soon, I must come back and fetch you.\" It was not Mr. Vaughan ; it might be Dr. Church. She had not time to wipe away all traces of tears before the door opened, and \"Mr. Mortimer\" was announced. He was close beside her, before she could struggle against her agitation and raise her head to receive him with fitting dignity. Perhaps he saw that all was not right, for he took the initiative himself, and covered any backwardness on her part, while she felt his manner to be both kind and gentle. \" You are drawing, I see.\" And as he raised the sketch and looked at it, a deep flush covered his face. He put it down quickly, while bending over it with an inarticulate expression, partly of surprise, partly of pleasure. \" That old familiar scene ! \" he said, presently. \" You have done it well too ! You have hit its peculiar character \u2014 wild, dreamy, and secluded; quiet and peaceful now, but how these quiet waves can rouse themselves to battle and chafe against those jagged, sharp rocks ! \" He looked at her for a moment. \" You like that spot, then ? \" \" Yes ! betcer than any other in the whole world ! \" she answered quickly, not having quite recovered herself even now. \" Yet it is peculiar rather than beautiful.\" \" It is not for its beauty perhaps, but \u2014 but \" .she hesitated, and stopped."], [56, "48 UPS AND DOWNS. \"Association? \" \" Yes ! my happy time was there. I suppose every one has one happy time, to which the rest is all \" \" All what ? \" he asked. \" Blank \u2014 not happy \u2014 a contradiction of the first,\" she said ; then added, growing pale as she spoke earnestly : \" Mere endurance, resignation, \u2014 scattered hopes, and baffled will ! Yet this may be, they say, the best sort of happiness \u2014 only \u2014 so very hard' to reach ! \" \" Your happy time was there and then ?\" he repeated, murmuring low to himself. \" One would hardly have dared guess so.\" He moved from her to a distant table, and nervously and absently turned over the books lying there. Granville Mortimer was not a man to be guided by sudden impulse. He prided himself on keeping a curb on all demonstrations of feeling. However bound ing and eager were the pulses, there was a barrier beyond which they dared not pass. It is astonishing what wild commotion is sometimes hidden beneath a composed and frozen exterior. His heart was madly urging him on now. Yet nothing but the extreme stillness shown in everv feature, in his very finger touch, betrayed emotion. His eyes glowed darker and darker \u2014 his cheeks grew paler \u2014 but he drew himself up erect, battling \u2014 resolv ing \u2014 considering. She did not see it. She had enough to do to keep still \u2014 to control her own beating heart. Her eyes were again dim with tears, and she was giddy and confused."], [57, "A CRISIS. 49 The moments flew by unmarked, save by the faint ticking from the ornamental timepiece \u2014 moments preg nant with life and happiness \u2014 moments that could never be recalled \u2014 -never ! He puts down the book so tightly grasped in his hand, quietly : shifts it, so that it shall lie in its wonted place \u2014 in the angle to which the housemaid had assigned it, uniformly with many others. It is unseemly to act in a hurry. Hope in glorious beauty is by him, pointing to a magic scene, in which all his life's dreams are realized ! He sees it all plainly. Faint, as it were, with eager joy to make it his own ; \u2014 yet he will meet it calmly. He will be sure of himself. He turned at last, drew near her again\u2014 lifted that drawing once more. His lips trembled a little, but his voice sounded stead}* and mellow, without any of the huskiness or sharpness of agitation. \" My happy time, also, was there and then ! I did believe it gone for ever. That one flash of light which made the rest so infinitely more dark by contrast. But \" his hand shook so much, that he put down the drawing. Clearing his voice, he came a step nearer to her. She looked up at him, but instantly dropped her eyes. Words were hardly needed now ; eye had spoken to eye. Yet it was a moment of intense suspense, \u2014 till at last he broke out, no longer in calm and measured tones, but as one in anguish, \"\u25a0 Ellen ! Ellen ! It has been bitter But, no ! before I \" suddenly checking himself, \" first, answer me one question ! I know you will say the truth. Are you thinking of another ?

Speak the truth sincerely, I implore you ! \" Her breath came quickly, but she raised her eyes to answer him, \u2014 when, noiselessly, but directly in front of her, the door swung open, and Watkins, loaded with cushions and wrappers, ushered in her lady. Mrs. Wentworth's usual grace and ease were lost in the languid, the almost tottering, way in which she sought her couch. Ellen flew to help her, even at that moment, struck by her pale looks. Not tdl she was fairly placed, did she appear to recognise Mr. Mor timer ; when she waved her hand and bade him \" Good morning.\" \"I have been so wearied and delayed by that pest of life \u2014 a dressmaker ! Ah ! you gentlemen are to be envied. Your tailors don't kill vou with measuring and fitting on. It is just a magic touch \u2014 an order \u2014 and all is right. Certainly women have all the small, for which read ' great,' trials of life to their share.\" Probably Granville heard not a word of all this. His only answer was a low bow. He could control himself up to a certain point, that is, he could rein in his pas sionate nature, but he could not stand this ! Murmuring something not exactly intelligible about business, he bowed again to Mrs. Wentworth, and gave an imploring look at Ellen, who was still arranging cushions and drapery, not well knowing what she was about, however. She saw the look, and so far obeyed it, that she moved away from the couch and offered him her hand. She also attained sufficient courage to say, \u2014"], [59, "A CRISIS. 51 \" Can't you stay a little longer ? \" It was the impulse of despair. He only drew her on, nearer to the door and out of hearing : \" Not now. Write ! \u2014 write one word \u2014 my question ! If you wish to see me again, write!\" Then fervently pressing her hand, he left quickly. \" So I interrupted a tete-a-tSte,\" said Mrs. Went w*orth. \" Lena, positively you look guilty ! What is it? What have you been doing? What was he whispering about ? What was that he had in his hand, child?\" \" Only this sketch, Worthy,\" she said, handing her the drawing, and too happy at heart, for her doubt had vanished, to feel very awkward. \" And what did he say ? \" \" That he remembered being happy as a boy there. He alluded to old days and \" \"Romantic creatures!\" said Mrs. Wentworth, hi a light and careless tone, though she cast a keen glance the while at the blushing and smiling face, and even studied it for a few moments with a certain tightening of the lips, while Ellen gathered together her pencils. Then Mrs. Wentworth suddenly changed the subject, and spoke of their immediate return home. She had decided to set off on the morrow. \" To-morrow ! \" Ellen exclaimed, for it was much sooner than she expected. \" Yes ! You will be glad, I know. This air is killing me. I must go at once.

I like to go home,\" she said, evasively. And then drawing a stool near the couch, she chattered on, laughing and joking, and fondling her friend in a very flutter of spirits, longing to be alone, and yet shyly dreading it. But there was a feeling that everything in life had changed to her. It mattered not where she might be. Yet, to leave just now ! He said \" Write ! \" But how ? \" At last she was alone, and the question was seriously before her. She did not like to trust the letter to the prying gossip, which she well knew went on in the household. Was ever interruption so inopportune ! Then again \u2014 all regret was swallowed up in bliss. She could no longer doubt now ! All hinged on her answer ! How thankful she was that she had remained true to herself \u2014 to him ! She remembered that Lin- Day was to come for the evening; and there were some Italian books, which he had lent Mrs. Wentworth, to be returned : she could easily send a note in this way. It was a work of some time, the putting up this parcel, and the writing the note. It was but a bare answer. Nothing more. Of course it was not for her to add one word. She answered his question and that was all. Yet those few words contained a whole history. On"], [61, "A CRISIS. 53 them hung her fate, and when she folded the note, although alone, her face was crimson. While carefully sealing and tying the parcel, a knock at her door startled her. It suddenly flashed across her mind, how would Mrs. Wentworth like her doing this ? and for one moment it gave her such a feeling of guilti ness, that there was a second knock before she had the courage to say, \" Come in.\" It was, however, no formid able person, it was only Lily Day, her old favourite and loving pupil, who, perhaps, would sympathize in her joy more warmly and simply than any one else. It was Lily, looking so pretty and so fresh, in her well-chosen attire ! a little pale, perhaps, yet more refined and delicate in her soft gray dress and dark brown ribbons than anything Ellen had seen for a long time. She was very attractive. Her clear and blue eye, like a child's, fixed itself on your face with a wonder half shy and half confiding. Her manner was a happy blending of respect with naivete and freedom from conventional rules. There was a half-pleading tone in her voice, each sentence ending as it were in a minor key ; which, though sweet and interesting now, might possibly turn to a querulous whine in after years. At present it was relieved by the sweet smiles which dimpled her face, and the ready womanly tact to see at once how to serve and to please those she loved. Ellen made her take off her walking things and sit down ; but Lily insisted on helping in the packing-up, and reminding her, with a tearful smile, of the many former occasions in which she had assisted."], [62, "54 UPS AND DOWNS. \"Have you heard of any employment ?\" Ellen asked. \" Yes. Mr. Granville was so good as to recommend me,\" said Lily, stooping low over the trunk. \" Quite a respectable famdy \u2014 real gentlefolks, Miss Ellen! I shall be required to spend the whole day there, and walk out with the young ladies. There is a French teacher besides, which wdl of course be a great advantage to me, as I shall hear her speak. And it is very good pay, too ! \" \" Is it settled, then ? \" \" Nearly so. I believe the lady was half engaged to another. But she thought so much of \u2014 of Mr. Morti mer's recommendation, that she is trying to get off. Shall this dress go here ? \" After filling two boxes, she rose from her knees, with a face blushed to a pretty bright pink. \" How much better you are looking, dear Miss Ellen. You are glad about something, I am sure ! I know the look. You are glad to go away from this place ! Ah, but I \u2014 I shall be duller than ever without you to come to sometimes.\" And her eyes filled with tears. \" You dull ! Why you like London and its noise ! You don't regret Poole, do you, Lily ? \" \" No, oh, dear, no ! I do like all the gay shops and the fine people, and the parks, and the long bridges. When the sun goes down of an evening, you see such crowds on the bridges, enjoying the fresh air, \u2014 I like that. And the grand old buildings. \u2014 Yes ! I like it all.

Mine has not always been so easy that you should envy it.\" \" But,\" Ldy went on, \" you look so happy now, and I am feeling so very dull \u2014 so i down,' so miserable, I can't help thinking of the difference.\" \" Can't yon say what it is that gives you this depression? Perhaps by talking it over, you may lessen it,\" suggested Ellen, trying at the same time to keep down the rising joy of her heart, and to throw proper sympathy into her manner for Lily's real and fancied crosses. \" No, no ; I couldn't speak of it ! Indeed, 'tis nothing \u2014 only, only \u2014 I do sometimes feel as if I was not born to be quite what I am. Thoughts will come ; but I know it is all quite wrong. I am a drudge, and so I must remain.\" \" We are each placed where it is best for us to be,\" Ellen remarked, wishing she could find some answer which would show sympathy, and yet give strength. \" God knows best, Lily.\" \" Yes, true, Miss Ellen,\" she interrupted, impatiently. Then with a heightened colour, and keeping her face out of sight, she said, hurriedly. \" But some people don't"], [64, "56 UPS AND DOWNS. get what God gives \u2014 that is, the wickedness of men upsets things. 'Tis not so very wonderful after all, if I have such a feeling, for aunt let out, she has more than once, indeed, that as to my being the daughter of a dressmaker, or her niece \u2014 'twas just a make-up story to hide the truth. I 'm an unfortunate girl, Miss Ellen, I know, and must submit to my fate^ but if I have got feelings ' above my station,' as you say, 'tis because I was born a lady. Yes \" \" Poor girl ! It is but a foolish thing in your aunt to talk so \u2014 and if on one side \" \" On both sides !

But she said those who ought to care for me would most likely provide for me yet.\" \" All this is very strange, Lily. Take my advice and not think of it ; it can do you no good. Even if true, there must be some motive for the secrecy ; and, my poor girl, it is better to pass for the child of honest, good parents, as you have done, than to prove your right to gentility through sin. Does your aunt often talk so?\" \" Oh, no ! and she was greatly angry with me for alluding to it and asking more, and threatened me with dreadful consequences. Oh, Miss Ellen ! I don't care ! I don't think of it ; only, you see,\" and she burst"], [65, "A CRISIS. 57 mto tears, \" you must have patience with me, for I can't help liking gentlemen and ladies, and hating every thing coarse and vulgar.\" At last, after some more talking on Lily's part, Ellen looked up, laughing : \" Do you know I could almost guess you were what is called in love, Lily ? \" she said, speaking idly and in the merest joke ; but she immediately wished the words unsaid, for the girl's eyes filled with tears, while her face burned painfully. After striving in vain to over come it, she laid her head down on the trunk, and gave way to a violent burst of weeping. \" My dear Lily, I was only joking. Forgive me ! I am so sorry. But it is true, then ? Is there some one at last who has succeeded where the poor young carpenter failed? Tell me about it.\" \" There is nothing to tell \u2014 nothing ! Only, of course, now \u2014 I do \u2014 see people \u2014 very different from him, too ! Oh, Miss Ellen ; it was not like you to insult my feel ings about the carpenter, as you call him !

Ellen could only repeat her sorrow and beg for giveness, greatly distressed. At the same time she feared, from the girl's manner, that there was \" some thing in it.\" Perhaps in her capacity as governess she might have been trifled with. Ellen wished very much to get at her confidence, in order to warn her, and, if needful, to advise her to leave London. It was"], [66, "58 UPS AND DOWNS. a danger she had always feared for the girl. But at last, when the crying ceased, Lily was so humbled and so abased, that she could not get a word from her. She only repeated, \" It was all nothing \u2014 certainly no harm ! She felt low-spirited, owing to her aunt's having spoken very disagreeably to her, and then the notion that Mrs. Wentworth and Ellen were going sooner than she had fancied.\" In the midst of this a message came from Mrs. Wentworth to beg Lily to come to her room soon. Ellen smded, and bade her bathe her eyes and smooth her hair. She knew that a pretty present had been provided for her. It was one of those pleasant kindnesses which served to efface many little selfish or unsympathizing ways, and which drew Ellen so closely to her friend. So she managed to cheer Lily with many hints, and then, at the very last, putting the parcel into Lily's bag with her own hands, she bade her be sure to deliver the books carefully, and to take care that the note did not drop out. As she spoke, she placed it more firmly within the string of the parcel, and Lily read the address. Ellen tried to speak indifferently, and ex plained that the books had been lent long ago to Mrs. Wentworth. But when theh* eyes met for a final good-bye, both their faces were flushed. Lily hurried away, as if she was afraid of breaking down again ; and Ellen, after watching her as far as Mrs. Wentworth's room, shut her own door, feeling as if she had entrusted almost her happiness to the keeping of that small leather bag, and forgetful of all the suspicions"], [67, "A CRISIS. 59 and fears which the girl's manner had so lately roused, she gave herself up to the luxury of a day-dream. She was awakened at last by feeling very chilly, and finding she had let the fire go out. Hearing a step in the passage, she opened the door. \" Oh, Anne, is it you ? My fire ! Isn't Lily Day gone yet ? I have not heard her go.\" \" She left about ten minutes ago. My lady said, as it was so late, she must go in a cab.\" Ellen w*ent to Mrs. Wentworth, and found her so flushed and excited, that Watkins threatened the journey must be delayed. \" Pray, keep the light from my eyes,\" said Mrs. Wentworth, somewhat fretfully. \" I thought you must be in bed, Ellen.\" \" No. But how very late Lily stayed ? Surely she should have known better ! Why didn't you send her away ? \" \" Why should I? Are you jealous? She amused me much. Positively, I admire her immensely ; and it was capital fun to see her genuine admiration of my jewel case. I assure you she showed real taste, and was not to be taken in.

Such as her can't even know the worth of it ! She'll not think the ground good enough for her now, I guess ! \" \" Nonsense, Watty !

But she forgets I am growing old, and blue kills me at present.\" \" But, Worthy, how burning your hands are ! \" Ellen remarked, after fondling and kissing her friend. \" What have you been doing to make them so?\" And she gently stroked them as she spoke. Mrs. Wentworth drew them hastily back. \" Why \u2014 what should I have been about ? I am tired ! Fussed with Watkins' terrible 'to do' about packing. Go to bed, child !

It is to be hoped that Watkins will prove no true prophet, and that the child won't be robbed,\" and she laughed hi an excited way, which had the effect of hurrying Ellen off, for she felt that something had over-fatigued and excited her friend. Nor was she very much astonished to hear some hours later, when she herself had just fallen asleep, that Mrs. Wentworth had one of her nervous attacks. She immediately went to the room, for sometimes her presence was a comfort, and Mrs. Wentworth liked the touch of her hand, but now she was sent back at once. \" Missis said on no account was I to let you come near her, miss,\" said Watkins. \" 'Tis passing ; but 'tis all owing to talking with that slip of a girl. I knew what 'twould be when I came in upon them and found her crying. My lady can't bear sad stories no ways. She's too feeling a heart, and has nerves, you see, miss.\" Ellen wondered a little while what confidences Lily could have made. It was so like Mrs. Wentworth to fascinate the girl completely, and to turn her head almost with flattering kindness and gifts more munificent than judicious. However, it was not likely that Lily should fall much"], [70, "62 UPS AND DOWNS. in her way; and it was a reason against the hitherto disappointed wish ever being realized, which Ellen had indulged, of having Lily as a visitor at Blair. \" Poor girl ! may she be kept from harm and temptation,\" was Ellen's last waking thought."], [71, "63 CHAPTER VI. YES, OR NO? \"Ant letters?\" said Ellen, running into Mrs. Went worth's morning room. \"I saw the post-boy come,\" she added, while awaiting the opening of the bag, with an anxious, conscious face. \" It seems to me you do nothing else but watch his coming now-a-days.

I hope that is enough.\" Ellen turned them over nervously and rapidly, and her face clouded. She read the three notes, and with a low sigh left them open on the table. Mrs. Wentworth meanwhile read hers and smiled brilliantly. \" Why, Lena, what is it ? Poor child ! Those miserable Prospectuses or Notices ! It is always such a take-in. But I have news for both, and surely that is Edward Vaughan's writing, Ellen ! \" \" Read it,\" Ellen said, trying to smile in return. \" Well, I will say you are as cool a young woman as I"], [72, "64 UPS AND DOWNS. ever met with.

It will, no doubt, be a good ball.\" \" Do you really mean to go ? \" \" Yes, I do. And I mean to lose no time in ordering a dress. I intend 'Miss Raymond' to appear as she ought.\" Ellen was amused at this return to old habits, and asked what Miss Church thought of balls ? \" Oh, I don't pretend to think exactly as she does ! For myself, I really don't care ever to enter another ball-room. But I am quite maternally inclined now. It will be a nice opportunity for presenting you to the elite of the county.\" A lively conversation went on relating to this affair and Ellen's dress, which she insisted on being mourning, if ever so slight. It was evident that Mrs. Wentworth's whole interest was excited, and, as Watkins said, it did her a great deal of good. Ellen left all the ordering of the dress to her friend, not from indifference, but feeling sure of her taste, and also being disinclined to throw herself into any occupation."], [73, "YES, OR NO ? 65 It was now more then a week since they had left Lon don, and no notice of her note had been taken. Every day she expected either a letter or an arrival. The suspense was beginning to wear her a little. Not that she was really doubtful or unhappy. She brought up numerous good reasons for the silence. He might prefer coming to writing, and his leaving London might be delayed or difficult. He might be very busy, &c. This morning it struck her that Lily might have con trived to lose the note. At all events it would be as well to write to her, and inquire if she delivered it and the books. This she did, and then resolved not to make herself uneasy, or to live in such constant expec tation. If he came, it would be just when she was not thinking about it. Yet, every ring of the bell, every man's footstep, every carriage or horse that came, sent the blood rushing to her face. She assured herself again and again, that now all was, all must be safe. She could not doubt his feelings any more, and even supposing that note never reached him, he was sure either to write to her or see her. The one thing that rather frightened her was, what he had said about his going abroad so soon. Possibly, he found himself obliged to go at the appointed time. But even if he did, that would make no difference beyond causing delay. He would either write and give his address, or he would find a way of returning for a day.

Ellen was obliged to keep down her eagerness about the post, for she found that it worried and excited Mrs. Wentworth very much. After the first flush of pleasure about the ball, she had sunk back into her old low and nervous state. At times Ellen was very uneasy about her, and found the flurry of her friend's spirits and her excessive sensitiveness trying. The morning of the ball-day, this was particularly the case. The post-bag had been taken to Mrs. Wentworth's own room, which she had not left. There was no letter for Ellen, and when she came to her friend soon after, perhaps just a little grave looking, she found Mrs. Wentworth so flushed, and in such an irritable state, that she was obliged to go away and leave her. Towards evening Watkins came to tell Ellen, who had spent a lonely and rather anxious day, that her mistress was much better and would be quite able to go to Rock Castle. She also gave Ellen a hint not to allude to her expecting a letter; for that, somehow, anything connected with letters or the post worried Mrs. Wentworth much. \"Very well,\" Ellen said, dryly, not quite liking Watkins to know that she was expecting any letter. When Ellen came to the dressing-room for approbation, she was received with hearty and lively satisfaction and pleasure. In fact nothing could be better than the dress. It was white and transparent,"], [75, "YES, OR NO? 67 4 with just a slight line of silver and amethyst running through it here and there.

The colour was becoming to Ellen's clear and delicate complexion, and all Watkins' best skill had been devoted to the sdken braids of hair which wound round and round her head. Mrs. Wentworth might be excused her somewhat triumphant glance, as she entered with her adopted child, and heard and saw the murmur and looks of admiration which followed them. She herself looked nearly as well as ever. Ellen knew it was all excite ment, but strangers admired the bright glow on her cheeks, and her easy elegance of manner. Now, as always, a crowd soon collected round her. Many of her old admirers were there, and of those who saw her now for the first time, there were some who even turned from the beauty of the young girl to the woman of the world, and hardly knew which to look at. If this was, indeed, her last ball, as she repeatedly declared, she reigned queen to the last She was conscious of this ; and pleased besides at being graciously received by the stately lady, now a duchess, who at one time, it was said, had looked coolly on her. It was pronounced a splendid ball. No expense had been spared, and every room in the fine old castle had] been made the most of. Rare plants stood in profusion everywhere, and the music was the best that could be had. There were many beauties there that night, but Ellen took her place beside them, and amongst those pronounced to be \" the F 2"], [76, "68 UPS AND DOWNS. belles \" some voices spoke her name. She had never been in such a scene before. Her utmost fancy as to what such a fete might be was realized. She was delighted with the decorations, the noble rooms, the dresses, the distinguished look of many of the higher rank, and more than all, she was pleased w*ith the exquisite music. There was something in the whole scene to increase her own joy and hope. Every passing fear vanished ; and while fully enjoying the present, she w*as carried back to the past. She heard a voice in her ears in all its old beauty of tone. She was content and happy. Her heart had found its rest. She thought she never knew before how much she had loved. The whisper had gone about that the beautiful Miss Raymond was also destined to be passing rich. Of course she had numerous worshippers, and more claims for her hand than there were dances. At another time all this might have made her harsh and ironical, for such kind of attention is after all easily seen through, but to night she was very indifferent to it. Every rise and fall of that thrilling music spoke to her heart \u2014 and in those touching wind instruments, a human voice sounded. Not only to her was this feeling confined. Another had closely watched her \" success,\" though from some con scious, almost contradictory feeling, he kept aloof. Mr. Vaughan, standing among the crow*d gathered in the doorway, had seen Ellen pass into the dancing-room, and afterw*ards had never once lost sight of that flowing white dress. For some time he forbore joining Mrs. Went worth, who had scarcely time to remark his absence,"], [77, "YES, OR NO? 69 so fully was her attention occupied. Yet something whispered to him, that notwithstanding the file of part ners he had seen asking her hand, Ellen would contrive to keep at least one or two vacancies for him \u2014 her old \"friend.\" Ah! he had cast off that title. At this moment he aspired to something else. He was (led on, doubtless, by the excitement of the scene and the music) hoping to see her receive him with rather less of her usual frank kindness. A little shyness \u2014 -some signs of embarrassment would be more dearly hailed now than any amount of eager warmth. He had resolved not to delay any longer. He felt the time had come which must decide his future. He felt it to be a good oppor tunity, which it certainly was. For let wise, prudent folks say what they will against love in a ball-room, what place is equal to it for making that confession, w*hich, when it comes from the heart, always needs external help \u2014 so timid, so sensitive, is all real deep love \u2014 love which shrinks from giving pain, or even a moment's uneasiness to the beloved \u2014 \" seeking not its own.\" How seldom can a meeting be brought about free from intrusion and \" management ! \" How awful is the tete-a-tete brought about through the intervention of friends, stiff and constrained \u2014 both the words and the manner ! But, in a ball-room, in all that crowd, there is protection and privacy. The very presence of others gives confidence. The stolen moment has its own peculiar charm ; it is less premeditated. The very interruptions are a gain. Then, that accompaniment, that thrilling music, filling so well the pauses, and"], [78, "70 UPS AND DOWNS. its tender wildness suggesting words appropriate to express the feeling of the heart. Mr. Vaughan felt all this ; and at this moment he knew what was the secret, wonderful power of music, capable even of leading to death. Man of the world as he was, free from all species of mauvaise honte, open, joyous and true, he trembled as he felt the horn* was come at last. On it, he knew, he had staked all his earthly happiness. At last, seeing the space before her a little clearer, and just as a favourite waltz struck up, he made a desperate move. Coming close to her he said, \" Am I wrong \u2014 presumptuous, in hoping we may have our favourite waltz together ? \" She gave a pleased look of surprise and welcome, offering him her hand. \" Couldn't conceive what had become of you ! You don't deserve that I should have remembered you. But I have \u2014 and I refused half a score of exquisites.\" \" Being sure I should not fail you ? \" he interrupted, speaking in something of his old way, yet there was a touch in the voice, which struck her at once, and made her look at him. \" I was not far off,\" he added. \" I have been looking on \u2014 trying to act the impartial judge and critic on your appearance and dress.\" \" Well, and w*hat is the resrdt ? Speak honestly ; though after all, it is all Worthy's, whether credit or blame.\" \" Is it ? \" he said, earnestly. \" Then I give her the credit ; at least,\" he added, laughingly, \" of an excellent choice in this aerial attire. What do you"], [79, "YES, OR NO? 71 call it ? Is it silver, or lace, or gauze ? In fact it is very perfect \u2014 only, may I venture ? \u2014 you know my preference for blue, at least for you.\" \" Yes,\" she answered, with a beating of her heart, remembering that another also always preferred that colour. \" Yes ; but you see I am in mourning, and this lilac is a sign of it, though a slight one.\" And something like a cloud came for an instant over her changing countenance, for the thought struck her, woidd \" he\" consider her unfeeling to be at a ball, while she wore such deep mourning ; and Bessie, in her widow's dress, pale and sorrowing, seemed to stand before her. Mr. Vaughan observed this passing emotion, and turned, with her hand still on his arm, and perhaps even unconsciously pressed a little closer than the crowd rendered necessary, to greet Mrs. Wentworth, who rallied him on his late appearance on the field. He read in her eye and smile encourage ment, and gladly drew hope from it. They took a few turns ; being so accustomed to each other's style of dancing, and being well suited in height, they always enjoyed waltzing together independently of all other pleasure. Ellen was naturally fond of dancing, in which she excelled \" It is the best dance I have had; let us go on again.\" He complied ; they danced till the last clash of instruments proclaimed the end of the sweet strain. Then he led her on, out of the room, through different corridors, and up and down steps, apparently knowing his way well. Everywhere it was a blaze of light and colour ; different parties"], [80, "72 UPS AND DOWNS. were grouped, here before a picture or a statue, here listening to some one or two first-rate professional singers, whose presence added to the many charms of the evening. \" Where are you going ? \" she vainly asked. He smiled and hurried her on without explanation, himself almost pale and trembling with more than the fatigue of his late exertion. They reached a small octagon room, hung with fluted silk, and fitted up all round with the softest and most inviting couches. One table only stood there, on which lay a few books and an exquisite statuette representing \"Faust and Marguerite.\" The light here was dim and soft, falling from a coloured lamp suspended from the ceiling. \"It is a delicious place, so cool \u2014 so 'resting' after the glare; though, by the way, how perfectly they have managed the lighting up here to-night,\" she exclaimed, looking around as she spoke. \"Do sit down,\" she added, observing his paleness. \"You seem tired; I made you go on too long with that delicious waltz.\" He sat down beside her, but he could not command himself to say one word. He examined the books, though without seeing a letter, in truth. \" What is the matter ? One would suppose you had all the cares of the world on you,\" she remarked, seeing his pre-occupation and silence. \" You seem very happy to-night, Ellen ; you enjoy such scenes ? \" he at last said. \" Yes ; I am happy,\" she answered, almost longing"], [81, "YES, OR NO? 73 to claim his sympathy in her joy. She liked him so very much she did not approve of his unusual gravity, and feared there was really some reason for it. \" I like this ball,\" she went on, \" it is so perfect a thing of its kind. My eye is pleased, my ears charmed by those wondrous wind instruments which seem to speak to one's very heart.\" \" So I feel. I wish they would speak for me. It seemed to me but just now, that they were actually saying the words I would have said. Did you hear them, Ellen ? \" \" I ! \" she said, quickly, and looking up at him, for again both words and voice struck her. He was playing with his watch chain, looking down ; but she could see that some strong agitation was at work. \" Well ; yes ; of course, I heard some words from them ; my words ! Everyone heard what they wished to hear, I dare say,\" she said, rather nervously, and laughing. \" Might not it so happen, through force of sympathy, or whatever it may be called, that two people heard pre cisely the same words ? \" he asked, still not looking up. She blushed deeply, and longed to have some excuse to go. She felt something was coming. \" Yes, perhaps \u2014 I can fancy that,\" she said, gravely. \" It was a delightful dance ! \u2014 our old favourite tune, but made so beautiful by that band,\" he went on, half as if speaking to himself. \" I almost wished it could go on for ever ; I dreaded the end.\" \" You do, indeed, speak seriously of a waltz,\" she said. \" There will be others as good.\""], [82, "74 UPS AND DOWNS. \" Yes\u2014 no ! I dreaded it, \u2014 \" he said, drawing himself up, and looking full at her, \" because I had resolved that the end of that dance should decide my fate. Ellen, I brought you here to ask \u2014 to learn; \u2014 you know\u2014 my future happiness rests on your next word. \u2014 Speak it ! \" he said, huskily, and with an impulsive gesture of his hand. She was much moved: greatly distressed at his exceeding agitation. His words came out with a gasp \u2014 he was so very pale ! his limbs seemed to shiver and tremble. She did, indeed, feel the truth of Mrs. Wentworth 's saying that it was \" no light thing.\" \" Oh, Mr. Vaughan ! \" she exclaimed, in a tone of deep sorrow. \" Stop one moment ! \" he held up his hand eagerly, and a deep flush passed over his face. \" I must beg to say, that all this tune I have been patient \u2014 waited \u2014 tried to hope \u2014 did not like to teaze you. In fact, I thought \u2014 I seared there was some early attachment- But,\" he added, gaining firmness as he went on, \" I have considered at last that this can hardly be. If there had been any truth in it, there has been such abundant opportunity. In fact, I dare persuade my self that there is no obstacle of that kind. God only knows how I desire, how I pray, there may be none at all ! I can wait longer \u2014 only \u2014 only \u2014 I must have hope ! \" \" Oh, Mr. Vaughan ! you asked to be my friend. I have received such kindness, such goodness, from"], [83, "YES, OR NO? 75 you ! But \u2014 yes, although others did hint \u2014 I would not believe ! Have I been wrong and untrue ? \" \" No. If there is any wrong, you are not to blame,\" he said, decidedly, but in a sad voice. \" I will tell you all. You are my friend. I have been very miserable ; for there was misunderstanding. You are right \u2014 it was from my girlhood \u2014 we knew each other then. He went abroad \u2014 I believe we both understood each other: but, of course, there was no explanation. Then came a wretched time ; no matter how ! It is at last cleared away. At last ! \u2014 I consider myself at this moment engaged. He was speaking \u2014 actually speaking \u2014 when we were interrupted. He is shy and reserved, and holds back. Mrs. Wentworth came in. \u2014 She won't like it ! \u2014 she dislikes him. But I can't help it ; I don't want her money.\" \"Then I am to understand you are positively en gaged ? \" he said, in a hollow, but quiet, tone. \" Not exactly : I was to answer a question. I did do so. But I have not yet had any answer. I am expecting a letter, or, perhaps, himself, every day.\" There was a few moments' silence. \" Please,\" she said, \" don't tell any one ! Please, I should be so glad, if you could keep Worthy from knowing \u2014 this \u2014 about you, I mean. She is so very fond of you ! She will be so hurt ; and she is so very far from well now.\" \" It will be difficult,\" he said, \" for she has always been interested in my favour. But, since you wish it, and, indeed, I see your motive, I will try to keep"], [84, "76 UPS AND DOWNS. her in ignorance \u2014 in ignorance that it is all over ! \" he added, bitterly, but very quietly. Ellen's tears came at this. \" Don't pain yourself ; it is my own blind folly \u2014 I might have seen \u2014 your manner has, in fact, never been encouraging, except in as far as I chose to in terpret it. What a marplot I must have been, too ! \" he said, remembering the times he and Granville had come in contact. \" Allow me, Ellen, however, just to say, that as you stand in this matter pretty much alone, it seems, and act contrary to your friend's wishes and without her knowledge, I think, under the circumstances, the gentleman should not keep you in suspense, whatever may have been the cause for keeping him aloof so long. Now, surely, he should come forward openly as becomes a suitor of Miss Ray mond. Your very prospects make it needful for you to be careful, and not to rush on anything alone.\" \"I understand you,\" she said, \"but I assure you he is not one to whom a fortune would be any temptation. I believe the idea has kept him away rather.\" \" Indeed ! Yet I believe he is not rich ; and, after all, one can't marry upon nothing. However, for give me, I don't doubt his being all that is honour able and right. Ellen ! give me your hand once more.\" \" Once more ! \" she said. \" Siu*ely \" but she stopped suddenly, for Mr. Darner's face appeared at the door ; apparently he saw that he had chosen an"], [85, "YES, OR NO? 77 awkward moment, for he only muttered something about seeking a friend, bowed, and left them in a hurried way. Mr. Vaughan smiled sadly. \" Damer is mystified. By the Avay, he is a friend 0f_of \" \" Yes ; he and Mr. Mortimer were college friends,\" Ellen said. \" I didn't know the Darners were here. Perhaps this may \" But she checked herself with the thought, \" No ; even had he been there, he would not have come to a ball-room ; and, surely, he would not be in the neighbourhood without first coming to Blair ! \" But the sight of Mr. Damer had stirred her, and Mr. Vaughan was for the instant forgotten. Perhaps he perceived this, for he sighed heavily, and let go her hand. \" I won't detain you here. People will talk \u2014 Mrs. Wentworth will speculate. But, Ellen, I still claim our old bond, we must be friends still and always. Luckily, I have a good excuse for leaving this for some time. I want to visit my niece, whose health is very indifferent.

A partner was seeking her, and at the end of the dance Mr. Vaughan was no longer to be seen. He"], [86, "78 UPS AND DOWNS. had gone home, Mrs. Wentworth said, very tired, apparently. It was odd that he could not even wait for supper. Mrs. Wentworth and Ellen did, but the former became faint in the middle, and a message came from the cloak-room to beg Miss Raymond to join her friend there. Sir Frederic de Lisle, who was sitting near her, offered his services to take her, which Ellen gladly accepted. She was glad to go, for everything had changed to her now*, and the charm was broken. She o * saw nothing of the Damers, though Sir Frederic said they were somewhere in the crowd. Mrs. Wentworth was completely knocked up, and it was with difficulty they got her into the carriage. It was a dreary, sad drive home \u2014 the sky overcast, the wind piercingly cold. Mrs. Wentworth seemed very ill too ; and right glad was Ellen to find that at last they had reached the gates. Very soon she had taken off her finery, and leaving the elegant dress spread on a couch in a spare room for the present, she hastened to her friend. Little did she imagine with what feelings she was destined to look at it next time. After much faintness and distress they managed to get Mrs. Wentworth to bed. It was very plain, that she was quite unequal to any such exertion. As she had said, this must be her last ball ; at least, \" till she was much stronger,\" Ellen added. As she appeared inclined to sleep, and Watkins said she should lie down on the sofa and not leave the room, Ellen was persuaded to go to bed herself. While she sat before her fire ruminating on all that occured, a peculiarly dismal"], [87, "YES, OR NO? 79 wailing sound of wind seemed to sweep by her windows, rattling them slightly as it passed, and then it seemed to die away with a sharp, yet mournful whisper among the branches of the trees which grew by that side of the house. Ellen shivered, and a melancholy feeling seemed to creep over her. The remembrance of the real pain she had seen in Mr. Vaughan's only too expressive face troubled her. But not long did she rest on that. Long afterwards she recalled with com punction how soon her thoughts had flown to another subject \u2014 whether the new day, even then begun, might not bring her the earnestly longed-for letter. So with this hope, and with a somewhat confused head, and the strains of waltz and gallope running still in her ears, she at last fell asleep."], [88, "80 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER VII. A SUDDEN PARTING. \" Mrs. Wentworth has had a good night, and will be glad to see you, miss, directly,\" was the answer to Ellen's enquiries. She had slept late, and at last was disturbed by the violent stormy wind which had risen, and was apparently trying the strength of trees and shrubs. Blair was certainly a windy place. To-day the sky was black and angry, and a dull surging sound, heard even at that distance, proclaimed the fury of the sea. \" Come in, Ellen, and explain the meaning of this,\" said Mrs Wentworth ; \" that is if you can, and I shrewdly suspect it possible.\" She was sitting up in her velvet-covered, high-backed chair, delicately pale, with the blue veins showing distinctly on her temples and hands. Her eyes were bright, and the hollow* which had lately come to her once smoothly rounded cheeks, told of illness. To Ellen's enquiries, she said, impatiently \u2014 \" Better ; but very much annoyed. There, read it ! \" she said, holding out a note, which Ellen at once saw to be in Mr. Vaughan's writing. She changed colour a little as she took it."], [89, "A SUDDEN PARTING. 81 \"It was sent an hour ago,\" continued Mrs. Went worth. \" Very hurried ; he did not say a word of it last night ! \" \" He did to me.\" Ellen was glad to be able to say so. The note spoke of a sudden journey to Paris, and mentioned his niece's health as the reason for his going. There was nothing more but friendly wishes for both Mrs. Wentworth and Ellen, and asking if he should do anything for them in Paris. \"He told you? Then was that the reason he looked so strange just before the supper, and why he went off ? \u2014 so unlike him ! Ellen, your face tells tales ! I am certain that something passed between you. If, if \" But in vain she tried to articulate another word. A sudden deep flush rose to her face, and then died away, leaviug it ghastly pale. A grey shadow crept over her brow, and she pressed her hand on her side, while her head dropped back. Extremely alarmed, Ellen rang the bell. Watkins was, however, closer than she thought, and must have heard all that passed. But it was no moment for Ellen to notice this now. \" She has fainted, Watkins,\" she said, taking up a sal volatile bottle. The maid went up to her mistress, and without turning, said, \"You had better go, Miss Raymond ; please, send Hannah here ! No ! you can't do anything ; please to go,\" she added, sternly. Ellen looked back once, \u2014 that look she never forgot. For months that figure was constantly before her. Mechanically, she never knew how, she not only found VOL. III.

Then she walked about from one room to another, touching this and moving that, thinking she was busy, but never daring to return to the room. Many thoughts flew over her mind, confused and perplexing. She remembered that she was expecting a letter. She thought of Mr. Vaughan's sorrowful face, and his lonely, miserable journey. Then suddenly looking round the familiar room, the thought struck keen and cold on her \u2014 perhaps at that moment it was all hers. She tried to repeat, \" She has only fainted,\" to impress the fact on her mind. The post-bag came, and it was brought to her with the key. In silence she opened it, and laid aside several letters directed to Mrs. Wentworth. There was not one for her, but she did not feel disappointed ; everything seemed a blank, herself a stone. At last there was a stir in the hall, and Dr. Edge hill's voice made her run out to meet him. From his looks she knew that he had heard what she had not dared to say in her message. He left her, and went up-stairs. When he returned, she was sitting on the sofa, crying. He drew a chair opposite to her, took her hand in a grave, kind manner, and said, \"It must have been very sudden, from the servant's account. I have long feared something of the sort.\" Then came the full burst of natural grief; all and"], [91, "A SUDDEN PARTING. 83 everything was forgotten but that she had lost her best friend, lost her home. The doctor had been and was gone; Mrs. Edgehill had joined her husband. Ellen was calm and still, and how still the house was ! Only that raging, restless, furious wind, rushing and rattling the windows, or booming down the chimneys. \" Have you any idea, my dear, where the will is ? \" enquired Dr. Edgehill. \" You see,\" observing Ellen's face express impatience at the question, \" such matters must be attended to. Mrs. Wentworth had no near relation, and we all know you are her heir. But it will be necessary to inform the Clares of this, and, in fact, business must be attended to.\" \" There is no will.\" \"No will? My dear, you must be mistaken ! I hope you are wrong ; surely she has made a will ! Probably it is with her solicitors, though \" \" I am very sure there is none,\" Ellen repeated. \" While we were in London, not a month ago, she complained, and was annoyed by Miss Church telling her she ought to make a will. I should have known, if it had been done since. She had a dread \u2014 a horror of it\" \"Very blameable! most wrong \u2014 superstitious!\" muttered Dr. Edgehill, pacing the room in perplexed annoyance. But he said no more to Ellen. He was sure after all that she must be mistaken. Perhaps G 2"], [92, "84 UPS AND DOWNS. Mrs. Wentworth did not like her to know it, wished to keep the inheritance doubtful, so that she might be more dependent. A will was surely somewhere. And accordingly, with her man of business, every corner, except the most private, was searched ; and a summons was also sent to her london lawyer and Mr. Clare. Everyone in the house, together with the Edgehills, treated Ellen as undoubted mistress. But she refused giving any order, and referred every- thing to others. She was much cast dow*n. Each day made her more realize her grief. And bitter self- reproaches came, for not having made this friend more entirely her first and sole object, of late. She was angry with herself for every thought apart from her, and then she felt glad that she had been spared the certainty of her attachment to Granville Mortimer. She had suspected something of the truth with regard to Mr. Vaughan. It was a bitter thought which long aggravated the sorrow, that the immediate cause of death might have been the excitement caused by her suspicion. In vain did everyone assure her, that Mrs. Wentworth's life had hung on a thread for months \u2014 that anything might have killed her. Ellen blamed herself, and even asked herself, if it were possible to go over it all again, could she have sacri ficed her own will and love to please this, her best friend ? No ! but she imagined over and over again, how much better she might have managed, and how likely it was that the unhappy prejudice existing might with care and time have been dispelled. It was"], [93, "A SUDDEN PARTING. 85 a great loss to her just now, that Mr. Vaughan was away and separated so entirely from her. At this time his presence would have been grateful and com- forting. He had loved Mrs. Wentworth, he was like her son or younger brother ; kind as Dr. Edgehill meant to be, he could not quite sympathise with Ellen, and he was greatly troubled about the will, even to forgetting almost everything else. Mr. Clare came, also the London lawyer. But no one had heard of the will. The desk and escrutoire were carefully searched, but Ellen's assertion seemed to prove true. There was no will. \" In that case,\" said Dr. Edgehill to his wife, \" Mr Clare, being the next of kin, will claim all.\" \" Poor Ellen Raymond ! \" exclaimed his wife. And \" Poor Ellen Raymond,\" \" Poor Miss Raymond,\" was soon in everyone's mouth. At first the idea seemed not to strike her. Mrs. Edgehill said she believed that Ellen was ignorant of business, and really not aware how important this \" no will\" was to her. Mr. Clare smiled at this, in his grave fashion, but said nothing. His wife and two daughters came for the funeral. Ellen was surprised and not quite pleased at the patro nising manner they showed to her. They pitied her very much, and were very attentive and careful for her health, saying she looked ill. Miss Clare remarked that she hoped anything that had passed was forgotten, and would not now come between them. To which Ellen assented quietly, and thought they were very"], [94, "86 UPS AND DOWNS. eager to ensure themselves as future visitors to Blair. Her ignorance, however, could not last long. She began to suspect something from words dropped from time to time by the Clares. \" This is Miss Raymond's, I believe,\" Mrs. Clare said, pointing to a work-table. \" We must be very careful to pick out all your own things,\" she added to Ellen. \" Of course there is no hurry. They can remain here.\" Another time she heard Mr. Clare say, in answer to some remark of Dr. Edgehill's. \"Yes; it is a pity. But the whole thing was so wrong, so injudicious from the very beginning\u2014 it was positively cruel to raise hopes and not ensure them. But you must own, sir, it would have been a most shameful act\" \" Mrs. Edgehill ! Do tell me. The Clares seem to expect to live here, are they to be her successors ? \" asked Ellen, one day. \" My dear, I am grieved to say \u2014 yes ! Mr. Clare being next of kin inherits all, if no will is forthcoming.\" \" I am rather sorry that they come to this dear old place. She never liked them ; and, indeed, they behaved meanly to her. If it was really some one she liked,\" sighed Ellen. \" It is most unaccountable ! I am certain poor Mrs. Wentworth can hardly lie quiet in her grave. She doated on you so ; she was so fond of you ! And to think of these people, with whom she was, as you say, never over friendly, having all \u2014 every single thing. But"], [95, "87 A SUDDEN PARTING. she gave you some of her jewels, I know. Of course they are your own. You must be careful to claim every thing she ever gave you, for I see they won't be very liberally disposed.\" They were not. Mr. Clare himself would have acted well, but he was over-ruled by his wife and daughters. Ellen soon found that Blair was no longer her home. And notwithstanding their repeated request for her to remain as long as she liked, she could not quite stand seeing them ruling, and, worse still, turning over all her friend's things \u2014 all the little precious hoards and old valuables kept from childhood. So she asked the Edgehills to invite her there for a time ; and collecting all that belonged to herself, she took a sad, almost bitter farewell of what she had learnt to beheve would be always her own home. When at the vicarage, and there was no longer any cause for exertion, she fell into a low nervous fever. It had all come so very suddeidy upon her ! And though she strove hard to bear her loss of fortune heroically and philosophically, she found it a very severe trial. But for the present she could not think steadily of anything. She was ill, and sad-hearted, and felt utterly lonely. A sting was added to all her trials by receiving no letter, no message, not even any certain tidings of him towards whom her heart yearned in her new and heavy grief. After writing several times to Lily, a curious scrawl had come from the aunt, saying that her niece had left her altogether ; but that she had every prospect of being happy ; and as soon as she sent her address to her aunt"], [96, "88 UPS AND DOWNS. Miss Raymond should know. She believed they were travelling at present. So Ellen gave up hearing any thing from Lily, as it seemed that she was become a regular governess, and had possibly gone with the family abroad. In her letters from Cecil's wife, she heard that Granville had gone abroad, but that they had not heard from him for a long time, and did not even know what his address was, or what took him away. All this was strange and unsatisfactory. From Mr. Vaughan she received a most kind and friendly letter, entering entirely into her grief and loss, as well as the sad mistake their poor friend had made. He said he should remain at Paris for some time, and probably take a lengthened tour as far as the Nile, with some old friends. He wished that his presence could be any comfort or use to her ; but he knew the contrary, and felt it best for both not to meet just yet He ended by asking what her plans were ? This brought a fit of tears. Her plans ? She had none ! She stood alone in the world. Mrs. Raymond wrrote as a matter of ceremony, but said not a word about her coming home. She seemed to take it for granted that though not the wealthy heiress she expected to be, some handsome provision would be made for her. When Dr. Edgehill saw this letter, he said certainly Mr. Clare could do no less.

At the age of twenty-one, and with a sound constitn-"], [97, "A SUDDEN PASTING. 89 tion, the most severe grief is not apt to kill. Ellen struggled through a tiresome and weary illness, which was most certainly aggravated by her state of constant suspense and expectation. An early spring had set in w-hen she was first able to leave her room. The sight of snowdrops and crocuses, and the pleasant sunshine, only upset her. As she recovered health, so did the fulness of the trial, the greatness of her loss, come upon her. If only it had not been so very sudden ! Could she but have had some of those precious last words to dwell on now, she thought. How could she have been so blind ? How was it, that seeing her friend so failing, the truth had never come straight to her ? Then she regretted so bitterly and with so much reproach, having concealed that passage in her life from her \u2014 that important happy moment ! Perhaps had she been open as she ought to have been, all her wearing suspense might have been avoided. Mrs. Wentworth could, and would have helped her ! Now, there was nothing to be done, but to wait \u2014 wait on, and on. But although hope deferred maketh the heart sick, not once did she beheve it was any thing but a delay \u2014 an accidental, provoking delay. She treasured up his last look, the touch of his hand, his voice, and his words. Surely her own face, which was always called a tell-tale one, must have spoken something of the truth for her ! Oh, yes ! wherever he was \u2014 whatever kept him \u2014 she was sure he understood her, and she could afford to wait with so much hope. She would not doubt or mistrust him."], [98, "90 UPS AND DOWNS. Some day it would be pleasant to tell him how com pletely she had trusted him. Perhaps the news of this change in her fortune would hasten him. And under this impression, she wrote long letters to Louisa and to Bessie, entering into many particulars, which at another time she would have shrunk from. But they were for his eye. Through them he would hear of her. She also ventured to ask where he was ? When this was done, another dreary pause came. She could not settle to any occupation. To take a few turns in the sun, and then sit quietly on the sofa and watch good, kind Mrs. Edgehill move about the room, to turn over a book listlessly, was all she did. And her friends grew uneasy and said she ought to be roused. They held consulta tions what course to pursue. At last Mrs. Edgehill began to wonder at Mr. Vaughan's absence, and from that she went off into a long speculation, as to how much his absence added to Ellen's dejection, and why he did so ? Luckily Ellen never knew it ; and except a few hints dropped vaguely, they never alluded to the subject to or before her : but Dr. Edgehill at last wrote to Mr. Vaughan begging him as an old friend of hers and Mr. Wentworth to return. It was probable that this letter never reached him, for no answer came ; and they afterwards heard through the De Lisles, that Mr. Vaughan had set off on his travels."], [99, "91 CHAPTER VIII. THE NEW HOME. It was April \u2014 a warm showery season, such as it should be. Along the whole length of the Abbey valley Spring reigned triumphant. It was so shut in and sheltered from east winds that bud and blossom came out fearlessly, and swallows were seen hovering over the clear trout stream. It was here, in these thick woods and about the wild and deserted garden, that Ellen loved to ramble. She spent half her days there, as she grew strong and able to walk. What were her thoughts, no one knew. She had become silent and reserved, though very gentle. Her friends at the rectory loved her and showed her the truest kindness. They would never hear of her going. Why should she leave them? Was she not satis fied? If so, was there not room and to spare, and who had they to be with them now their niece was settled. So she stayed on, feeling a cowardly dislike to facing the future and settling on any plan \u2014 in fact, waiting, expecting still. Other friends, the De Lisles, and even the Damers, were pressing in offering her a temporary home, but she preferred the quiet old"], [100, "92 UPS AND DOWNS. vicarage, and seemed to love all the old haunts about the village and the cove more than ever. She was surprised one day at seeing some change at the Abbey. A large waggon stood in the square court, and was speedily filled with the household goods of Farmer Lewis. Gardeners also w*ere rolling and weed ing paths and mowing the lawn. She inquired the meaning, and learnt that the house and adjoining land had been bought and that the Lewises were removing to the Abbey farm, for he still possessed the estate and the cottage at Ashby Cross, for which he could get no tenant. No one from the village cared to live there, even rent-free, so rife were the tales about Goody Fleet and the strange noises heard in the place. Ellen watched the men as they removed disorder, and strove to give the place an air of neatness. She wondered who was coming there. Perhaps some cockney family who would \" improve \" the place forth with. All her old dreams of purchasing the place herself were over. Yet not in vain had she studied and improved her natural talent for drawing. That very morning, the long-delayed disagreeable question of ways and means had been considered by her, and so much was her own original money reduced that it would barely, if at all, suffice to allow her to live as a gentlewoman. She then remembered her former plans, and at once settled to turn her drawing into a means of livelihood. She would take portraits. With very little practice she was sure to succeed, and if she charged moderately and according to people's means,"], [101, "THE NEW HOME. 93 even in this very neighbourhood, she might find em ployment. She was full of this idea when she returned to lunch at the Rectory. She meant to beg the Vicar and his wife to give her sittings for practice. To one of her temperament, the necessity for exertion and work was life. A popular author says, \" Every new responsibility to an earnest nature is a prop to virtue.\" And Mrs. Edgehill observed on her im- proved looks directly she came in. Her colour was partly returned, and once more her eyes had the old eager look. The very tone of her voice was different, and spoke of renewed hope and vigour. She spoke of the movements at the Abbey, and asked if it was known who had bought the old place. \"Yes; this very morning, I heard that Mr. Vaughan had bought it. His bailiff told me, and was even then giving orders for sundry improvements.\" \" I know he was inquiring a great deal about it,\" said Mrs. Edgehill, \" but Lewis then would not sell. As it is, probably Mr. Vaughan has paid a fancy price; and the house is much out of repair, I am told.\" \" A strange fancy,\" the Doctor remarked. Meanwhile Ellen's cheeks were very red. Something told her that he had set about this purchase for her sake. He alone, save Mrs. Wentworth, knew all her love for the old place and all her dreams concerning it. Now, he must be vexed at his own success. Perhaps he would resell it \u2014 or let it. It must be useless to himself. That post brought a letter from Bessie. She entered warmly into Ellen's \"wrongs,\" spoke of her illness"], [102, "94 UPS AND DOWNS. among strangers, and seemed to long to be with her again. She also alluded to her own future, saying that the Mortimers were more than kind and had settled a small income upon her. Hetty and Ruth seemed happy with their step-mother, but she herself had rather have her own home, however humble, and as soon as they proceeded to Brussels she should return to England. She asked Ellen's advice about where she should settle, and asked her own plans. Then it was that a thought seized Ellen, which, the longer she considered it, the more desirable it seemed. So before that night she had written and sent her letter to this effect : \" We are both homeless and alone. Why should we not have the comfort of being together ? Bessie, bring your two little girls here ; I will rent the old cottage at Ashby Cross. It is true I am very poor, but I have the means of adding to my income ; and you say you have enough for your small wants. Come, then, to our old place \u2014 the dear old haunt of other days. We are again alone in the world, let us be together.\" The Edgehills, on the whole, approved of the plan, observing, however, that the place was very lonely, even wild during the winter months. In summer it might be pleasant, and certainly it was well to remain in the neighbourhood among friends. As to the scheme of portrait painting, they would not hear of it. A Miss Raymond paint pictures for sale I She would think better of it. Besides, surely, Mr. Clare did mean, in common honesty, to do something for her !"], [103, "THE NEW HOME. 95 Some of the Blair delicacies had been sent, with Mrs. Clare's compliments, every week during Ellen's illness. The ladies had also called to enquire for her, and seemed disposed, as Mrs. Edgehill said, to be civil and attentive to herself and the Doctor. They were also doing great things in the parish ; but of this, out of delicacy, Mrs. Edgehill forbore to speak. Ellen sighed when she heard of their visits to the poor and the new school-house, and liberal subscriptions for sundry village reforms. Had her friend lived, she, too, had intended carrying out many such schemes. The new views she had gathered from the Churches had opened her mind to the duties of a landed proprietor ; and the remembrance of this change, encrusted as it was with old habits and worldly feelings, mingled too with the natural vanity and love of praise and admiration, was Ellen's greatest consolation. She forgot the faults in remembering all the peculiarly lovely and winning qualities of her friend. She missed her hourly \u2014 never again should she see one so beautiful, so fascinating. The only being who in the least resembled her was, Ellen thought, Mr. Vaughan. How or why, she hardly knew. It lay in the winning grace of manner \u2014 the perfect refinement and well-bred tone which dis tinguished him from almost everyone else. She had never met with anyone so completely un-egotistical. This was the real secret of his charm : his own feelings, or thoughts, or peculiarities were never obtruded. But he rather threw himself into another's mind. His joyousness was so pleasant \u2014 his thorough freedom from"], [104, "96 UPS AND DOWNS. affectation was so satisfactory. She wished she could forget his saddened look. Was it possible for him to be really unhappy \u2014 had he staked all upon her love ? No ; not all. Ellen believed him to be a man of true piety at heart. He would learn to accept the trial in no morose or hard spirit. It might sadden him, but it would not make him entirely unhappy. This was the difference. When she thought of another, she feared the effects of any great disappointment. They were so unlike. Those words, \" It has been bitter, Ellen ! \" she went over them again and again. They explained so much that had hurt her in his manner. She knew now how much he had suffered \u2014 that though he had from a feeling of duty banished her image from his heart, he had suffered : he had loved her, in fact, all the while. Where could he be ? Why did he not come ? Hardly a gentleman visitor came to the Vicarage with out exciting a passing hope and leaving a pang. Once Mr. Damer called alone, and stayed to luncheon. Ellen thought the voices were alike. So also were many of the opinions. It excited her strangely ; and as Mrs. Damer was not there, with her odd, blunt remarks, she threw off her shyness and talked freely. Mr. Vaughan's purchase of the Abbey was spoken of. Mr. Damer looked keenly at Ellen, and from something in his manner, she felt that he supposed it was for her sake that it had been bought. She was vexed ; but knew not how to undeceive him. Just as he was going, she asked if he knew anything of his"], [105, "THE NEW HOME. 97 friend, Mr. Mortimer. She spoke abruptly, after meditating the question long. \" I wish I did,\" was the answer. \" He is the strangest fellow ! It is nothing new for him to allow months to pass without a line ; and then, as likely as not, he drops down upon us suddenly. My wife has settled that he will appear some fine morning soon.\" \" But is he not abroad ? \" Ellen asked. \" He was ; but where he is now, I can't tell. I wrote to his publishers, and their answer was, that the gentleman was travelling on their account at present, and they could give no better address than Munich, where he may be. Depend upon it, we shall see him soon. I am not sorry he has lest London. I shouldn't be surprised if he was keeping himself quiet for the purpose of preparing to present himself as a candidate for holy orders. Nothing would rejoice me more.\" These words served to renew all Ellen's own hope and courage. It was her nature to hope ; and she could much better bear such great trials than the smaller annoyances of daily life, where the habits or manners of others jarred with her own tastes. Granville was not the acquaintance of a month. She knew him so entirely. He was not fickle. Where he once loved, it must, she was sure, be for ever ; even if he thought it proper to crush it; and now she stood clear before him \u2014 he must feel it \u2014 as much his own Ellen as before he lest England five years ago. More so \u2014 much more. For all the coquetry and caprice VOL. III. H"], [106, "98 UPS AND DOWNS. of that age had passed away from her. Surely he must have seen it ! It was therefore with full trust in him and in her future happiness, that she threw herself earnestly into the new life now opening to her. As soon as Bessie's acceptance of the offer arrived, she set to work to renew and beautify the cottage. Her presence kept the workmen alert, and at the same time, she caused the small garden to be dug up and put in the most complete order. She resolved that it should be a gem of its kind, and every hardy plant that would bear the brunt of storm and spray should be cultivated, but nothing impossible attempted. Her old favourite servant, Anne, was only too glad to live with her, in whatever capacity hereafter judged best. Bessie was to be housekeeper and mistress. Ellen retained and fitted up a room for her own \" studio,\" as she called it. She must have independence and time to pursue her own occupations. In this room she collected all her old treasures. Some of those tilings formerly belonging to her mother's room at North House, and which had been kept for her at Poole, were sent for, as well as one or two reliques which Cecil had thought fully bought in at the sale of his brother John's things, and which were now sent for Bessie. The cottage gradually assumed the look of a home, and was really both comfortable and pretty. There were plenty of small rooms, quite enough for their family. They had all the summer before them. As to the winter and those storms which people warned"], [107, "THE NEW HOME. 99 her were at times really terrific, Ellen rather believed she should like it \u2014 or \u2014 many things might happen before then. It was a desirable home for the present. Beyond that she cared not to look. As she said all this with her old spirit, and smiling gaily, the old couple exchanged glances. They put their own construction on tins avoidance of the future, which invariably mingled with Ellen's ideas. Evidently she expected some change. And they rejoiced to beheve that it would not be long ere she was again lifted to her own rightful station. They coidd not believe that Mr. Vaughan they liked so well, cared for her loss of fortune. Whatever might be his reason for his absence at present, it was sure to be a good one. Before winter, as Ellen hinted, \" something might happen.\" So they kept up her spirits, and only mourned at the idea of losing her pleasant society. But Ellen promised to come every day to see them, and prophesied that when once they knew her sister, she should no longer be prime favourite. Everyone loved Bessie best ! Perhaps Ellen had never so anxiously watched the clouds and hoped it would not set in for a regular rainy fit, as she had done all day. The cottage looked so much better, like most other places, in sunshine, and she was so anxious for Bessie to be pleased, and to receive a good first impression. Ellen knew that her sister had not cared so excessively for Ashby Cross in old days as herself. Their tastes always differed. Bessie thought it so lonely, and so stern and wild ; H 2"], [108, "100 UPS AND DOWNS. she preferred a garden landscape, and a sunny culti vated country. And now, with her spirits and health so broken, Ellen rather dreaded the effect of the scene. She had w*orked hard all day setting everything in complete order, and never thinking the finishing stroke had been given. Now, as she was expecting their arrival, she paced up and down the little terrace walk overlooking the sea, and a thought arose, causing a strange flutter at her heart. Perhaps this arrival was only the precursor of another ! Bessie's presence gave additional security, as it were, and hope gave spring to her step and a glow to her countenance. Then the sound of wheels caught her ear, and in another five minutes she and her twin sister were clasped in a close embrace. The meeting was too solemn, too full of change and of pain for words. At least, they only spoke of ordi nary things ; and Ellen admired loudly her little nieces' beauty as she laid aside their bonnets and stroked their long, fine hair. Lisa was still the same, a thought ful, sensitive child. The little one was brilliant in colouring, and more healthy and vigorous. She w*as singularly like her father. Ellen looked long at her, with curiously mingled feelings. Bessie observed it, and said, \" Isn't she very like ? \" It was evident in a very short time, that, though fond of both in no ordinary way, the youngest was something peculiarly precious to the mother. She w*as constantly watching her. It was her pride to trace the resemblance \u2014 even"], [109, "THE NEW HOME. 101 the very faults of his temper, \u2014 the somewhat hard selfishness, which came out strongly in the child, was hailed, not as a fault, but as being so like \" her dear father.\" But, except in this way, Bessie did not allude to him. Ellen could never bring her to speak of the past. After the first flush and bustle of the arrival had cooled down, when the tea was finished, and the httle girls had gone with Anne to look at the sea and the garden, the two sisters mutually examined each other. They were both changed. Ellen was almost shocked, when she fully realised the alteration in Bessie. She was many years older ! So worn and fragile, yet very calm. Far less timid and shy in manner. No blushes ever rose and fell now ; the tears no longer stood in her soft eyes, which was wont to be the case ; she was altogether more self-possessed, more pre-occupied, and less hanging on the words and looks of others. She was still gentle ; yet, now and then, Ellen fancied there was a slight tone of complaint, not exactly fretful, neither bitter, yet speaking of a sense of being wronged. She seemed to live much in a dream. Her former unpunctual, undecided habits, which had fatigued Ellen and worn out herself, were changed for indifference. She was still unmethodical, as Ellen soon discovered, but she was no longer sensitive about it, and vexed at annoying others ; there were no more touching, winning, little penitent -speeches. It was all a matter of indifference : as if she no longer cared about pleas ing or displeasing others, and as if everything was too"], [110, "102 UPS AND DOWNS. great a fatigue and trouble. All this gradually dawned on Ellen. But Bessie was at once struck with the change in her sister, though after the first evening she no longer remarked on it. Ellen was altered for the better. At Blair she had flourished, and all her natural beauty of person had expanded like a plant in congenial soil. Her manners, too, were altered, but for the better. There was less of temper, more control, more quiet earnestness. \" How beautiful you are!\" sighed Bessie. \"I thought Hetty was the belle of our family ; for she has grown a splendid creature, but, now I see you, I no longer think her so. Yes, it is true, it is quite true I see it, now,\" and a look of great pain came over her. \" You are grown younger, and I older,\" she presently said. \" And you are happy, Ellen ? Not miserably dis appointed, as they said you would be ? You look full of happiness.\" Ellen hesitated a moment, and then said, \" I suppose n so. Then towards night, when the children were in bed, after long and silently watching her sister, who sat working opposite to her, Bessie said : \"It is odd \u2014 but, Ellen, do you know, you have a look of \u2014 I hardly know how to express it, of waiting \u2014 no ; it is more like expect ing. You seem to be istening, and you look up so eagerly, if the door moves. What is it)? \" Ellen smiled, \" I don't know, but one is ahvays waiting, I think. Life is made up of expecting and"], [111, "103 THE NEW HOME. waiting! But,\" she added, \"Now I have you here, and I feel it is home, I dare say I shan't feel it so much.\" \" What ! what were you waiting for ? \" said Bessie. \" For happiness, I suppose,\" Ellen said, doubtfully, half wishing to open her whole heart. \" Ah ! \" Bessie returned quickly, \" can you still be waiting or expect ing that \u2014 at least here in this hfe ? \" And then she fell into a fit of deep abstraction, which Ellen was un willing to disturb. When she arose at last to suggest that it was late, and Bessie must be tired \u2014 such a face of misery, such a look of woe, such a gray, pale, stony expression met her, that she scarcely refrained from exclaiming. When they kissed each other she could not help pressing the thin figure very close, and whispering, \" Poor Bessie ! \" but Bessie's cold hands dropped from hers and she turned away, saying, \" Don't \u2014 I can't bear any pity from you.\" And this was their meeting !"], [112, "104 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER IX. WAITING. We must be allowed to resume the thread of our story somewhere about two years and a half after the date of the last chapter. The life which then opened to Ellen at the Cliff Cottage, though to her very full of work and earnest meaning, can be sketched in few words. She found in that quiet and retired spot a full opportunity for proving all her resolutions. Many a time did she recall her quiet talks with Mrs. Legard, and each re newal of those hours helped her on with fresh spirit for her task. It was no light one to her disposition. Bessie was indeed changed. The great tide of her trial and grief had well-nigh shipw*recked her. Naturally more feeble than Ellen, in her idolizing attachment for her husband she had imbibed some of his faults. At least she resented any, the slightest slur on him, and nourished a seed of bitterness, almost unconsciously, in her own heart, which soon spread, as all evil does, and causing her to forget her first lowly sorrow and penitence for his sins, she learnt to believe that from him she had received no wrong."], [113, "105 WAITING. Naturally, in this way, while mourning his loss, she grew to consider Ellen with less of the old partial love, remembering only that through her her husband had suffered. Bessie was not one capable of much con nected thought or self-examination ; and thus she was not aware of her own feelings ; but nevertheless they showed in her manners and actions, and were a sore trial to Ellen. Besides this, was the old bone of discord, for Bessie's habits of disorder and bad management did not improve. Her health was very failing, but Ellen never dared say much about it. Bessie invariably refused any sympathy for herself. Only with regard to the children, did the sisters meet in their old habits of affectionate intercourse. Here Bessie received all her sister's overtures graciously, and truly the little girls' presence was the olive-branch of the house, the constant and common interest. It was soon discovered that even with their quiet and retired manner of life, their joint incomes did not clear their expenses. This fretted Bessie, while it only confirmed Ellen in her previous resolutions. She made a start, against the wishes of the Edgehills and Bessie; but she had a will of her own, and in this respect would not be deterred. It was better to gain a few pounds in an honest way than to get into debt, or fret vainly over their own bad management, she said. That it was a great deal owing to ill-management, Ellen knew, but she would not hurt or annoy her sister by inter fering, beyond a little advice \u2014 which did no good. So she made public her desire of taking portraits, and"], [114, "106 UPS AND DOWNS. very soon she received quite as many orders as she could manage. People were curious and interested about her, knowing Mrs. Wentworth's intention of making her rich. She was also a Raymond, which was sufficient to ensure curiosity at least, for myste rious tales had long been afloat about the family. Then her beautiful drawings were also remembered; and, in fact, her plan answered. Visiting the different houses, which she generally preferred to bringing them to her cottage, involved the keeping a pony carriage. But this could be now afforded, and she rejoiced when she found the good the drives did Bessie, who wearied of the sea, and often longed to go inland as far as her strength would permit Miss Raymond's fame spread. She had applications far and wide. Sometimes she went to a great distance, and even stayed a week or so in some family, while drawing the children, or perhaps the whole family, from the grandmother or father to the infant in arnis. She was deeply interested in her drawing; but she had other work besides this. She had, after many delays, set up a school for the \" rude boys,\" whose fate she had so often speculated on. This and her effort to keep Bessie cheerful more than filled her time. Her friends often said that she worked too hard ; she was wearing herself out. But she answered that it would soon kill her if she had nothing to do. From one thing to another she passed, w*ith all the energy she had. Anything to keep off \"thinking and dreaming,\" as she said. For all this long time she still waited and expected. Not once had she heard"], [115, "WAITING. 107 from him ; and the accounts received by his own people were very vague and unsatisfactory. He was abroad and busy. He had plenty to do, and the sort of work he liked. Moreover, it was necessary to work now, he added, for he had an object besides himself to think of and toil for. These words served to keep the flickering flame alive in Ellen's heart What object could he have, save one? He might have lost what httle money he possessed; he was too proud to ask her to share actual poverty. He might be toiling and labouring all this weary time for her sake ; these words implied it. But, oh! if he only would write \u2014 one line! More than once she hastily covered a sheet of paper herself, resolved to defy all conventional rules, and appeal to him for one word of comfort and support : with that she could go on contentedly. But as it was there were moments when she felt it almost too much, the strain more than she could bear. Then she would tear up the letter she had written ; and remembering his sensi- tive reserve, his peculiarly strict notions, would blush at the very idea of writing to him. She recalled all the marked peculiarities of his boyhood, and strove to beheve that he was not to be judged by ordinary rules. She must wait still. Nothing but the know- ledge that he had married \u2014 or wished to marry another, would destroy her love and faith. He should, come when he would, find her ready. It was an expiation of her former faults ; he had once doubted her, he should find her now worthy even of his exalted ideas of"], [116, "108 UPS AND DOWNS. woman's devotion. But to keep up at all, work was needful. This was why she toiled so hard and gave herself no rest. Nature will not bear being over tasked, however, and Ellen grew thin, while her delicate complexion became more sallow, her cheeks sharper ; and more striking than ever, was the look which Bessie had noticed. There was always, more or less, a look of expectation in her eye, now and then exchanged for one of deep weariness. The Clares had never offered any help, beyond constant presents from the garden and hothouses, or game. All their invitations were declined ; but they kept up a speaking intercourse, and Bessie now and then returned their several visits. They did some good in the parish, and Mr. Clare was most liked and respected. He had resigned his living, but often assisted Dr. Edgehill, who was growing a little infirm. The Darners also had left the neighbourhood for the north of England. The De Lisles were constantly kind and good neighbours ; and once the whole cottage party stayed a week with them. Mr. Vaughan, after a year's absence, returned from his travels, people said, not only tanned out of all knowledge, but older and graver. He had certainly left some of his pleasant, gay spirits in the pyramids. He was shortly after elected member for Colminster, which took him a good deal from home. He was a busy, active country gentleman, but saw little company. He called pretty often at the cottage when at home ; and during his first visit, when Ellen was away for some \" sitting,\" he made firm"], [117, "WAITING. 109 friendship with the little girls, and also won the mother's heart. He spoke of the change Mrs. Went worth's death had made to him, so that the neighbour hood was now very sad. He also inquired closely about Ellen, but in so quiet and unembarrassed a manner, that all Bessie's ideas, encouraged by the Edgehills, and long since implanted in her heart, vanished. She was sure there was \" no truth in that fancy.\" After some time, and while they were together pacing up and down the terrace, he inquired if Miss Raymond's marriage would not soon take place? \u2014 at which Bessie showed genuine astonishment, and won dered what he could mean ; adding, that certainly it was rather odd, but Ellen had never, that she knew of, even had an offer. Upon which Mr. Vaughan apologised for his mistake, and then fell into an un usual fit of silence, while his companion went on talking of Ellen and her energy, and her \" over doing it,\" and all her own anxiety about her sister's health. If Ellen was a little fluttered w*hen she first met Mr. Vaughan again, it hardly lasted a moment. She was glad to see him, very glad to welcome him when ever he \" looked in,\" as he called it, in the course of his rides. So it came to be a habit to expect him at all hours. Sometimes, indeed very often, Ellen was absent, but he seemed content with the mother and her children; and gossip began to talk of the possi bility of the \" sweet young widow, leaving off her"], [118, "110 UPS AND DOWNS, weeds; and that men were rather fond of marrying widows,\" &c. Mr. Vaughan's visits seemed to Ellen like connecting links to her past life at Blair. In his animated conver sation and sweetness of manner her own taste was again satisfied ; and more than she knew did her whole nature yearn after what was graceful and pleasing. She was one of those persons, of whom it may truly be said they are born to be rich and great ; luxury seems only a part of their nature \u2014 that is, luxury as regards freedom from all coarse and sordid, all jarring cares and ways. It pervaded her whole being, and perhaps under whatever circumstances she might be placed \u2014 however poor, she would have surrounded herself with a certain grace, which seems inseparable from some natures. As it was, she retreated often to her own studio to avoid the irritation which a want of order induced in the rooms common to the family. The little girls soon learnt that Aunt Nellie disliked any disorder, and she tried hard to give them a taste for neatness. But the poor mother's habits prevailed. Nothing could ever make her in time for any meal, or have any one thing ready when it was wanted. She drudged on, and denied herself every comfort or in dulgence, but this want of method infected the servants, and Ellen's temper would have chafed under the dis comfort but for her constant employment Lisa was still her favourite, and sometimes the preference piqued Bessie. The little one was very apt to commit faults, and then in a light, playful manner"], [119, "WAITING. 111 to confess herself, which with her mother much more than atoned for the error, though it was commonly repeated directly afterwards. Once when Ellen noticed this, Bessie hastily said \u2014 \" But if she has done wrong, she has acknowledged it. Surely, Ellen, that is enough ? To confess a fault, is almost to blot it out.\" Ellen said nothing, but her countenance betrayed dissent. It was always a sore subject, and Ellen could only too easily trace the feeling to its root, to like to vex her poor sister by undervaluing even the little child's frivolous confessions of penitence. It was one of the many signs which betrayed the deep hidden sore, which was still unhealed, and which caused the poor wife's heart to thrill and wince under the commo nest and most innocent remarks. All this time she had never spoken to her sister of her husband's illness and death. But now and then she would lock herself into her chamber and spend a day of fasting and solitude, which no inducement or reasoning would cause her to stop. Sometimes, but not often, she would visit some poor people, and she tried to teach her children, but this was a sore failure. Mr. Vaughan's visits seemed to be her one and only pleasure. She took quite a warm liking to him. Though many and kind invitations came from Poole, urging her to come to them and let them know their little nieces, and even Mrs. Mortimer added a few trembling lines, begging her to bring her grandchildren, she would not hear of going to Poole. Sometimes she"], [120, "112 UPS AND DOWNS. expressed a desire to see Granville again, and wondered at his strange absence and silence ; but nothing seemed to move her much. Sometimes Ellen wondered if this was what was called a broken heart. Certainly the springs of life seemed to be injured. It was in the midst of summer. The cottage porch was a mass of honeysuckle, and a rose, which had braved many winters, now covered the wall with a gorgeous colouring on a rich green ground of leaves. The little garden was in prime order. It was evening, and the two little girls were happy and busy watering the flowers, their merry voices mingling with the bees' quiet hum and the noise of sundry fowls in the court yard. The mother sat, as usual, unoccupied, her hands dropped on her lap, while her pale face looked only paler by contrast with the bright which sur rounded her. Her eyes were bent on the children, but scarcely as if she saw them. Ellen was standing, lean ing against the low wall, a gipsy hat on her head. She crushed with unconscious energy some flowers the little girls had but now given her. Then all at once, with a deep, long, low sigh, she turned away with a weary air, and as she sat down near her sister on the grass, Bessie said \u2014 \" You are looking so very tired ! Is it a headache again ? \" \" Rather so.\" \"Oh! Ellen, Ellen ! It is all the smell of the paint, I know ! If you would but give it up, or at all events restrict yourself to crayons and w*ater-colours ! The"], [121, "WAITING. 113 end of it will be that you are utterly knocked up. You will be ordered to go abroad, I know,\" Bessie said, nervously, and in an aggrieved tone. \" Abroad ! Oh, no ! Can't afford it ! Yet it would be pleasant, would it not ? to go to Switzerland \u2014 the Tyrol, Italy, Florence ! Ah ! but I shall never fulfil my old dream, never, never see Florence ! \" \" Do you still care for it ? \" (in a weary, indifferent tone). \" Such a journey ! So much trouble ! And, after all, one place is much like the other.\" \" A visitor,\" said Ellen, not moving, however. \" Oh ! all my work is about,\" sighed Bessie, rising nervously. \" Sit still,\" said her sister, detaining her. \" It is only Mr. Vaughan. And I put aside the work before I came here.\" \" Mr. Vaughan, Mr. Vaughan ! \" was heard in joyful accents. \" Where have you been this age, Mr. Vaughan?\" exclaimed the little confident, pretty Rosie, running to him with extended arms. \" This age ! \u2014 and pray what is an age ? \" he said, catching her up and kissing her. \" Is it a week ? \" \"Yes; five days, I beheve,\" she answered, with a saucy smile. \" My hen has got five such loves of chicks, and my ducks can swim,\" put in Lisa. At last he reached the mother and aunt, and disposed of his young admirers by bidding them go and fetch a certain basket he had brought in his carriage. VOL.

I have finished my picture at last, and I want your candid opinion,\" she said. \" It is beautiful,\" Bessie observed. \" I am sure Ellen might have made her fortune in London. Though I may be no judge of painting, I am sure this picture must be good. It is hfe, more than hfe; what one wishes people to be in fact\" \" The De Lisles idealised,\" said Mr. Vaughan. \"But I see while you have been adding to then* beauties, you have \" he paused, with a look of grave concern. But even as he spoke the extreme paleness passed, and a bright flush spread over Ellen's face. \" You would say I have lost my own,\" she answered, laughing. \" But you all seem to forget that youth can't last for ever. I am going on for twenty-four. You mustn't expect impossibilities : I can't help in the nature of things looking w*orn \u2014 losing my bloom, in fact.\" \" What is to be done ? \" w*as his answer, appealing to Bessie, and trying to veil his real feelings in a joke. \" I don't know ! she is obstinate. Indeed, Ellen, you are ! There is no occasion for your overworking your self, and you know it,\" said Bessie. \" There is more occasion than you can understand,\" Ellen said, in a low voice, and drawing patterns on the gravel with the point of her shoe. \"Are you inclined for a turn to the cove?\" Mr. Vaughan asked. \" The tide is dashing in splendidly. I quite thirsted for the spray, as I came along.\""], [123, "WAITING. 115 Ellen rose to go, but Bessie declined, saying she did not like the sea. She preferred a tree or a garden at any time. Here the young ones returned, bear ing between them a basket containing strawberries and a few cherries, and in one division a choice selection of hot-house flowers. \" I hope you appreciate my improvement,\" Mr. Vaughan said, pointing to the flowers. \" A few years ago, I hardly knew a rose from a lily, and now, you see, really I can boast of a few fine specimens \u2014 eh ? \" He drew one out as he spoke ; one of the soft white tea roses, drooping its oval bud among its own rich leaves, and shedding a faint sweet scent, which Ellen was very fond of. \" This is yours,\" he said, offering it to her. \" Now, Mrs. Mortimer, will you arrange these, since you won't accompany us !

He had repeated the same thing at least a hundred times ; but it was from his heart, and she liked it. \" I don't know what we should do without them,\" Ellen returned. \" Do you think Bessie is looking at all worse \u2014 weaker ? \" she added, anxiously. \" No ; I thought, if anything, better.

I often think that is like me \u2014 my hfe.\" She laughed a little, and as they had reached the beginning of the cliff steps, she turned round to allow him to go first. Their eyes met. His were serious; with an indignant flash in them, too. \" How long is this to go on ? Jacob's serving for Rachel reversed is nothing to it,\" said he, with a short toss of the head. \" How long ? Oh, I don't know \u2014 always \u2014 perhaps, for ever.\" There was weariness in her tone. \" And you still cling to hope \u2014 you still have faith ? Well, I cannot go with you.

I can see nothing but the basest faithlessness, or some low, mean feeling of worldly"], [125, "WAITING. 117 disappointment. It may be caprice or temper, but even then, nothing but death, I say, can excuse a man from writing. How dare he trifle so ? \" \" Don't talk so, please ! \" she begged, with tears in her eyes. \" It pains me, and it is no use. It is the only subject on which you and I can't agree.\" \"Is it indeed?\" he answered, quickly. \"Do you allow that, Ellen ? Well, that is comfortable.\" They now began their descent, and all talking was stopped till they reached the bottom. They hurried on to the very edge of the beach close to the foaming waves, which seemed rising and falling in very excess of gladness \u2014 sparkling in the light and leaving the pebbles glistening with a beauty not their own. After watching the tide for some moments, Ellen moved to a rock and sat down. \" I certainly do feel tired,\" she said ; \" perhaps a change might do me good. I wanted to consult you.\" And she drew a letter from her pocket as she spoke, and put it into his hand. It was a proposal from a gentleman she had once met at a country house, for her to go to a fashionable watering-place about thirty miles away. He had as many as half-a-dozen pictures, or rather portraits, which he could ensure her. It was more than possible that she would get enough commissions to make it a very profitable trip. He offered to secure comfortable lodg ings, and regretted that being a bachelor he could not offer to give her house-room. \" I think it might be well to go,\" she remarked, as he came to the end."], [126, "118 UPS AND DOWNS. He did not answer directly, but made a sort of dubious noise, and looked very grave. \" You would not go alone ? You would all go ? \" \" No ; I think not. Bessie would not care to go again by the sea. If it were inland, it might be different Besides,\" she added, blushing and speaking indistinctly, \" I don't think it would answer ; I mean, that perhaps if I really need any recreation, solitude, and freedom, change in that respect is what I want\" \" I see,\" he said, dryly. \" Don't misunderstand me, however,\" she went on ; \" but poor Bessie is such a wreck \u2014 so altered ! And you can't know, it is impossible for you to understand how much I have cause to blame myself for it\" \" Go, by all means ! Yet you must not travel alone.\" \" Yes ; that 's easily managed. I can take my little maiden, and you know I am very independent, and no longer in my teens now.

I will make enquiries at once. When do you go ? \" \" The sooner the better ; you see he says it is juot their ' season ' now. I shall get more sitters.\" Mr. Vaughan bit Iris lip. He never could reconcile himself to her drawing for money, proud as he was of her success ; but it had been before agreed to drop the subject, since it ended in neither party being con vinced, and Ellen never liked paining him. \" Well,\" he said, \" I hope you will limit yourself to so many hours a day, religiously, I say as a matter of principle. The change may then be of service. Ellen, may I not ask you as a personal favour to do this ?

Yes ; I will promise to do what I can. But you are mistaken; it is not the drawing which hurts me.\" \" Whatever it is, then, can't you extend your promise ? \""], [128, "120 UPS AND DOWNS. \"But what can I do? It is beyond my control. What can I do more ?\" she said, in a voice of suffering, as if craving help. \" Would to God, you would give it up ! \" he half whispered. \" Yes ; and I say so without reference to any selfish feeling. I do indeed. Do you believe this ? Under any circumstances, I say, give this up.\" \" What more can I do?\" again she cried. \" I can't help believing, and \u2014 and remembering, and there it is ! I do no more ! Am I impatient ? But the truth is,\" she added, after a pause, \" I do feel this can't go on much longer, I mean \" she hesitated and coloured up, then stopped short. \" Go on ! you mean \" he put in. \" I have a sort of presentiment that I shall hear something one way or another,\" she said. Mr. Vaughan walked from her to the water's edge and back, without saying one word. Once he seemed about to speak, but checked himself. Her eyes were bent on the ground ; at last she rose, saying that Bessie always liked her tea early, and she must return home. And they spoke only of general topics till they rejoined the others. Bessie had apparently not moved \u2014 so she would sit half the day long. The children had not a stain to bring their punishment \u2014 rather, it seemed to their disappointment, but they coaxed him into a race and a survey of all the pets, while Ellen went in to make the tea. The fruit from Thorn Park was pronounced delicious, and Mr. Vaughan contrived to make a merry"], [129, "121 WAITING. meal of it. \" So different from what it generally was,\" as Lisa eagerly remarked, when she and Rose had all the chatter to themselves, \" for Aunt Nellie was always thinking of her drawings, or looking out of the window to see if anyone was coming: and mamma \u2014 poor mamma \" she looked at her mother and stopped short. \" Is very dull and dismal \u2014 Is that it, Lisa? \" Bessie asked. \" Why are you so ? \" said both voices at once. Mr. Vaughan luckily happened to recollect a very funny story about a pig at that moment, and the cheerfulness was not broken till he was about to go. They stood by the porch, and Bessie remarked he need be in no hurry, for there was an early moon. \" Well, I shall come again very soon, to report the result of my search,\" he said. \" Mrs. Mortimer, I suppose you approve of your sister's going to this place. You don't think the said old bachelor is to be suspected, do you ? \" Bessie smiled, and thought any change would be good for Ellen, and she would get rid of the fatigue of her boys' school too. Miss Clare would be too happy to keep the lads together, for as it was, she half envied Ellen's doing it, and seemed to think that every scheme of the sort should emanate from them. \" Indeed,\" Mr. Vaughan remarked, dryly enough ; for the Clares were no favourites of his, and his visits to Blair were very few and far between now."], [130, "122 UPS AND DOWNS. \" I almost think I can't go,\" said Ellen, slightly shud dering. \" I have not courage when it comes to reality.\" \" What courage can it need ? What do you dread ? \" asked both Mr. Vaughan and Bessie. \" I hardly know, but something \" and she stopped and looked at Mr. Vaughan. \" You will only laugh if I say it. But it is just one of my presenti ments ; I feel a strange reluctance to go there, as if something would happen. What a strange feeling it is ! I have had it several times, and always there has been a cause.\" \" Of course, the very notion indulged brings its own fulfilment. Only, don't go and destroy the peace of mind of the said ' old bachelor,' and specially don't fall in love with him yourself. I believe that Fernshore is a very ordinary, common watering-place, and I don't apprehend anything out of the way. But you know I am decidedly a disbeliever of ' presentiment.' The fact is at this very moment you are shivering, for the breeze is keen and the dew falling. Add to this over-fatigue, and there is your presentiment ! Lisa, fetch Aunt Nellie a shawl, if she will stay here ; or better still, do you both of you put her to bed, do you hear ? \" And pressing Ellen's hand, the only cordial, warm pressure she ever received now, amidst shouts of laughter from both children at the notion of their putting their aunt to bed, he drove off in his dogcart, followed by an old favourite hound, his constant companion. The sisters still lingered a little in spite of the dew*, but Ellen shivered again."], [131, "WAITING, 123 \" Go in ! \" urged Bessie. \"It is not that; I really can't go to Fernshore. A dread of something has come over me. I don't like leaving you and the children. How wailing the wind sounds to-night! Do you ever listen to all the wind says ? \" \" The whid says ! Oh, Ellen, how childish you are to be sure ! I know I dislike the wind and the noise of the sea perpetually in one's ears.

I am sure that Mr. Vaughan's visits here have a purpose.\""], [132, "124 UPS AND DOWNS, \"I suppose so \u2014 to see you and me,\" Ellen said, laughing. \"To see you rather,\" she rejoined. \"I used to think of it, and then I don't know how it was, but something put it quite out of my head. I believe it was his own manner, which I did not know. But I observe that, though unlike what is generally called a lover, his looks are very earnest, and he is for ever talking of you, if you are away. Strange, he asked me when you were to be married. I wonder what made him think so ? \" \" When did he ask that, and what led to it ? \" \" It was \u2014 let me see \u2014 yes, when I first came, long ago.

I forgot. I do sometimes forget that ! \" Her voice suddenly rising to a sharp pitch of pain. \"Do so always, entirely,\" Ellen said, earnestly. Then wishing to turn her attention from that painful train of thought, she went on \u2014 \"And what might Mr. Vaughan say ? \" \" I forget ; not much I believe.

Are you sure, do you think truly, that Alick loves Hetty, really ? that he has forgotten his love for you ? \" There was a tone of sharp pain again, as well as of touching earnestness in her voice, which Ellen well understood. \" My dear Bessie, indeed you are wrong. Alick never really cared for me beyond a boy's first fancy.

She was greatly moved, and after saying much about her young"], [134, "126 UPS AND DOWNS. sister's engagement, which they had only heard of that morning, she went back to Mr. Vaughan, imploring Ellen not to pain so good and kind a heart, and what ever she did, not to speak harsh or scornful words, even if she could not love him. \" Oh, Bessie ! don't you feel that I never could again? Has not the lesson, the punishment been great enough ? Don't doubt me ! And I assure you that Mr. Vaughan knows I only look on him as a friend \u2014 my best and kindest friend \u2014 but nothing more.\" \"Then he has asked?\" \" Well, since you have said so much, I will answer truly \u2014 yes. He asked and I answered long ago, before I left Blair.\" They said no more and soon went into the house. It promised to \" blow hard,\" so there was a careful fastening of windows and doors, and then both sisters retired to their respective rooms. For a few days the cottage seemed to wear even more than its usual air of stillness. A curious contrast to life without, for one of those raking, blustering tempests which occasionally visited that coast, kept up a perpetual din of battle. Ellen became listless, and coidd not settle herself to any one thing. She kept very much to her own room, and when she saw her sister, that sad, worn, suffering face seemed to strike her with fresh pain. Hetty's intended marriage was almost the one subject of their conversation, Bessie perpetually harping on her fear that Alick did not know his own mind, and if he ever saw Ellen, he would"], [135, "WAITING. 127 find it was her he really loved; while Ellen first seriously reasoned against it, and then tried what rally ing would do. But this she never did again. It was agony to Bessie, unless the children were present. This kind of talking \u2014 conversation it could not be called \u2014 went on till Ellen's brow began to pucker up and her nostrils expanded like an impatient thoroughbred horse; when she could bear it no longer she left the room, and then might be heard her quick, ruffled step, going up and down overhead, gradually becoming slower and steadier, till the spirit being laid for the time, she was free to pursue her own reflections. These could have hardly been pleasant, to judge from the set of her features and the oft repeated sighs, now quick and tremulous, now long and deep. It might have startled some of her friends, could they have suddenly broken in upon her, and seen the different emotions pass on her face \u2014 hke a lamp carried now slowly, now fast, behind some transparency, showing soft lights and bringing out the deep, dark shadows. In a few days Mr. Vaughan wrote to say that notwithstanding all his enquiries, he could hear of no \"eligible female,\" to whom to introduce Ellen, at present at Fernshore. But as he was obliged to go at once to London, he would while there keep the subject in mind. Warning her again to beware of the old bachelor, he bid her adieu for some few weeks.

Dr. and Mrs. Edgehill were in the parlour, and with them a third person \u2014 a stranger. \" Let me introduce our young cousin, Marian Ivon,\" said Mrs. Edgehill, upon which a smaU, slight, almost childlike creature rose and came forward shyly, yet willingly. Mrs. Edgehill explained to Ellen that she was an orphan, and had, she believed, come to try and find her home among them. \" Though it is very dull for a young child to live with only two old persons, and I must bespeak your good nature, you know, in her favour.\" \" She is very pretty, isn't she ? \" Ellen said, trying to catch a better view from the corner to which she and Mrs. Edgehill had retired in the rather dark room. Just then Marian's whole face lit up as she answered some question of Bessie's, and Ellen added, warmly, \" She is lovely ! \" Many regrets were expressed that Ellen was so soon going away for what might be a visit of some weeks. Mrs. Edgehill reckoned so much on her help to amuse \" Marian.\" She seemed quite to dread the charge of so young a girl, adding : \" She is almost unprovided for ; just enough for her personal expenses, that is all ; and then, as you see, she is pretty. It is such a charge, my love ! \""], [137, "WAITING. 129 Ellen laughed, and of course tried to cheer her ; and then there was a move, which enabled her to speak to the young stranger. She was glad to find that a pleasant voice was added to the pretty face, and as they moved more into the light, and at last quite out to the terrace to see the view, it seemed even more lovely than she had first thought. Pale brown eyes and hair as pale, but relieved from insipidity by a touch of gold, a merry mouth, full as a ripe cherry, and a saucy, espiegle nose, formed a very winning countenance, with all the bloom and halo of youth on it. Her move ments and her observations were childish and playful , and Ellen soon found that she was, though a little bashful at first, inclined to be very confidential, also demonstrative and warm in her manner. \" It is such a pretty place \u2014 I mean Ashby,\" she said. \" I dreaded coming very much, at first.\" \" Yes ; I suppose so.

But perhaps he was very young \u2014 boys fall in love. My brother Tom was in love at least three times before he went to India ; and he left at fifteen. He is in the Indian Navy. It was terrible for me when he left ; for we were so fond of each other. He means to come back as soon as he can save money, and we are to five together and keep cows and horses. Don't you like riding ? I never rode in my life. But it is my greatest ambition \u2014 my dream, in fact.\" So she rattled on, amusing Ellen not a little. It was something new to meet with one so fresh and simple, and, for a change, very pleasant \" They are calling ; I must go now. When you come back, you will let me come here and walk with you, Mrs. Edgehill says. She praises you up to the skies, and says you \u2014 but never mind,\" and putting her finger to her lip, she tripped off, and was in the httle pony carriage before Ellen had reached the door. \" It is so odd, her popping down here all at once ; we had no warning or notice! I never even heard her name.

Attractive quite as much from its river and land scenery as for its long and wide sands. There were no sharp, high cliffs \u2014 no overhanging rocks; but a long stretch of sand, available for donkeys and bath chairs, when the tide was out, and a well-made espla nade, rendered doubly attractive by a band three times a week. Further on was a small cove, where a few low, limpet-covered rocks defined the place called the Bathing Beach. From this point there was a pretty view of the town and the church, and the low wavy outline of shore on the other side of the w*ater. Fern shore town stood at the extreme point of the river Ferny, while the more recently built row*s of lodging houses and villas were nearer to the bar and the open sea. The place was full ; and Ellen found Mr. Torrens' prediction a true one. More work than she well knew how to arrange for, awaited her. Her enthusiastic friend had managed to secure her comfortable quarters and a hearty reception, as the heaps of visiting cards on her table proved. But, not feeling particularly"], [141, "\"A NEW LIGHT BREAKS ON ME ! \" 133 strong, she declined almost all invitations, preferring, after her daily task of drawing was done, to take her rest in driving about the pretty neighbourhood in a low pony chair, and adding to her collection of sketches. One scene always attracted her particularly, from its cheerfulness, namely the bathing-place, when crowded with mothers, nurses, and children. Many \" a study \" did she make of a group, with wooden spades, in broad hats or deep sun bonnets, building wonderful embank ments or digging ponds and rivers. And as she sat alone, watching sometimes a young mother, unmistakeably guiding the tottering steps of the first-born, or a more matronly personage, with her string of five or six, it would hardly have been consistent with her woman's heart not to feel the contrast. What was her waiting to end in at last ? What was the meaning of that sensation, which seemed to increase \u2014 a sort of \" presenti ment \" of change ; as if there was a sound of footsteps, the steps of \"fate, approaching nearer and nearer.\" When she found herself brooding on this, she always rallied and flew to occupation of some kind. She asked herself if it was a sign of failing health, or the natural residt of a sedentary pursuit and her long repressed anxiety? One morning, having put the finishing touches to a very lovely face, that of a young woman, much of her own age, and on the eve of marriage, these feelings weighed so heavily on her, that she put aside her picture hastily, and resolved to go out for an hour. A sitting would bring her in at one o'clock, but fresh air"], [142, "134 UPS AND DOWNS. would do her good and fortify her for the hard day's work that lay before her. She bent her steps to the bathing beach. Not so many as usual were there. The tide was going out. After searching about for some specimens of sea-weed she took her seat on the furthest point of a long low reef, which jutted quite out in the water. The spray and breeze came in delightfully, and the pleasant rush and lap of the water against the rocks shut out nearly every other sound. At last, however, a shrill voice rose above it and attracted her attention. A fine boy of about two years and a half was being held by his nurse. He was eager to escape from her arms, and she raised her voice to prevent him. Ellen enjoyed seeing him, and his fearless plunges, shaking his little curly head as it got wetted, and splashing his round and shining legs about. The nurse seemed half amused and half afraid, and kept her petticoats tucked up carefully, while the child at last succeeded in slipping away one hand from her grasp, and his glee at the additional freedom soon made itself heard in a merry laugh. The old bathing woman came down nearer and said something, to which the nurse replied by shaking her head, and for a moment Ellen's notice was turned to the curious, hideous old creature, too old to act now, but still looked up to as supreme authority by her amphibious sisters ; and the dread of all children, from her shaking head and wonderful costume. Scarcely had she reached her companions, who were sitting near the machines finish ing their breakfast, when a fearful scream rose and"], [143, "\"A NEW LIGHT BREAKS ON ME !\" 135 seemed to be echoed by the distant cliffs. It was a wild shriek of terror ! The bold little fellow had loosened himself from the nurse ; she stood with outstretched arms. But where was the child ? There ! \u2014 There ! Ellen caught sight of his white little arms. He was floating out far and fast \u2014 a mere gleaming speck. The servant made a desperate but ill-directed effort to reach him, but was apparently taken off her feet, for she staggered and fell, sending up another fearful cry for help. Ellen rushed to the spot. She heard the words shouted out, thick and hasty, \" It is the ground-swell,\" and in another moment knew its mean ing. She all but lost her footing, and seemed to be carried swiftly out to sea. A dizziness came over her, and the rushing sound was deafening. But she saw the child, and taking as firm a hold of her umbrella as she could, she breasted the cold waters, and again tried to reach him, but a receding wave carried him away, and again her footing gave way. The nurse, after some desperate floimdering and splash ing, had gained the shore, and was calling with all her might, \" Murder ! \" and \" Help ! \" Ellen heard it not. The whole energy of her soul and body seemed to be concentrated in the desire to reach that white, shin ing body, floating so helplessly before her. Again she watched the break and flow of a wave, and seized him firmly. This time, if he was carried away, they woidd be together. Immediately her footing failed, and she fell, with a horrible giddiness, and deafened by a con fusion of sounds. Then came a blow against something"], [144, "136 UPS AND DOWNS. hard, a ringing in her ear, a flash of light, and a dim consciousness that she still had a firm grasp on some thing wet and cold ; after that she knew no more till, roused by a sharp twinge of pain, she felt herself lifted, and knew she no longer held the prize for which she had risked so much. She tried to open her eyes ; but all seemed thick blackness ; and in the bodily anguish, the din and confusion, and the sickening faintness which returned at every effort to move, there came, with strange distinctness, the sound of a voice, every tone of which was famihar. Could it be a dream ? \u2014 or w*as this Death ? \u2014 the breaking up of what we call Time \u2014 the blending Past with Present? Again, above the, ringing in her ears, dispelling the deathlike sensation of swooning, the same voice sounded as if far away, yet so distinct ! \" Put this cloak on her. Support that arm ; it is broken.\" Famihar, every-day words they were. Oh, that she could see and feel ! What was it \u2014 the mocking of her own wandering brain, a delusion \u2014 or But her strength now fairly gave way, and all was blank ! The \" ground-swell,\" a common occurrence in this place, had caused Ellen to lose her footing. She had reached the child, and then fallen on a sharp rock, which partly stunned her and broke her arm. The child was protected by her body, and after some attention recovered. When Ellen awoke from her long trance, she found"], [145, "\"A NEW LIGHT BREAKS ON ME!\" 137 herself lying on a sofa in a strange room. A man was strapping up the fractured bone, and seeing her eyes open, he told some one to give her the salts. \" There, that will do ! Now, perfect quiet,\" said he, whom she recognised as the surgeon, addressing some person standing out of her sight \u2014 behind the head of the couch, as it seemed. \"You understand? No talking. Perfect rest. The head has been shaken, and it is an ugly fracture.\" No answer in words was given. After a few arrangements about the room, the doctor left. Other steps followed, but she cared not to look. Weary and aching, she closed her eyes ; she tried to recall what had happened, \u2014 to separate what was fact and what must have been dreaming or delusions of the brain. It was an undoubted fact that here she was, ill and disabled, all her work necessarily postponed, and a large expense entailed. It was strange that even at such a moment that one voice should have been in her mind ! Could it be that he was really dead ? and that the mys terious sympathy some people spoke of, in dreams or peculiar conditions of the body, had drawn them together ? She could not even think about it. She was just conscious that some one was moving about the room, a servant, perhaps. And then there was a low rap at the door, and a whispered question and answer. She thought she recognised the voice of her own servant, and cared not at that moment to know further. But this weary, quiet state did not last. The pain increased, and with it came fever. She"], [146, "138 UPS AND DOWNS. became restless and excited. A nurse came, and they took off her clothes skilfully, and got her into a bed. She inquired of Anne where she was. The nurse answered, \" Where she would be taken care of. She had been taken to the nearest house, as no one knew w*here she lived. She must compose her self and keep quiet.\" Ellen wondered a little how Anne had been told of the accident, and if all her drawings were safe, and who would tell Mr. Torrens of her illness. But these ideas became confused, and her temples throbbed. She supposed she must have been nearly drowned, and wondered vaguely at finding herself reduced to such an illness alone in a strange place. The thought suddenly struck her, how was the child ? She turned to enquire, but was met by the portly nurse offering her a composing draught with an air of authority, which stirred her to rebel and refuse. She shut her eyes again, and wished that her own Anne would attend to her, \" not that odious nurse.\" The door opened, and looking up quickly, she saw \u2014 could it be ? \u2014 or was it delirium ? \u2014 Granville Mortimer himself ! \u2014 but paler, older, sadder, but him self \u2014 at last ! \u2014 For the instant, the pressure of bodily pain wras forgotten, she did not stir or speak, she hardly breathed. \" Then it was his arm that saved me ! It was his voice I heard ! \" was the sole thought of the moment. And now he was beside her ! \" You will take this soothing mixture, won't you ? The doctor so earnestly wished it,\" he said, bending"], [147, "\"A NEW LIGHT BREAKS ON ME ! \" 139 a httle towards her. It seemed natural to be waited on by him ! One instant she looked at him to meet his eye, steadfast as ever, but hollower, and with a certain touch of reproach in its expression. About the lips there was constraint, speaking of agitation firmly suppressed. She took the glass, swallowed its contents, and whispered \" Thank you ! \" As he received it back, their hands met and his hp immediately quivered. Again she looked at him, and then put her left hand in his, saying, \" Was it you who saved my hfe ? \" He grasped it firmly \u2014 passionately, with an air of set determination, almost defiance. It seemed to her both sweet and right to feel his fingers close round hers. One short moment of bliss she did not care to hide, in spite of all the pain \u2014 one moment ! \u2014 the next a chill like death had struck her to the heart ! A low, but irrepressible groaning sigh alone told of all the bitterness which had entered, making the bodily pain as nothing ! But that there must be a stunning sensation hi such sudden transition from bliss to despair, which of itself helps to dull the pain, who could bear it and five ? \" Was it you who saved me ? \" she had asked, feeling glad that it was so, glad and happy, and scarcely sur prised ! Then came a pause. He seemed to be seek ing self-command, and was greatly moved, she saw. The answer came at last, in hollow, husky tones, \" Yes. That is \u2014 I pulled you ashore, \u2014 you having risked your life to save my child.\" \" Your \u2014 your child ? \u2014 speak louder ! \" \"Yes\u2014 my child!\""], [148, "140 UPS AND DOWNS. They were looking at each other still. Her hand fell from his cold fingers, cold as ice they were, but not colder than her heart. While her eyes were first dis tended, and then dim with surprise and terror, a burning light seemed to glow, to blaze up suddenly, in his ; his breath came quick and short, and his whole countenance worked with some strong emotion. But she scarcely noticed this; she slowly, heavily turned her head away, and gave one low moan, expressive of suffering. There was nothing more \u2014 not another look or word. He turned also, rigid now, and sternly cold. Whisper ing some directions to the nurse, he left the room. Much suffering followed \u2014 feverish tossing, and finding no rest, nervous starts and twitches, disturbed snatches of sleep and distorted fancies, turning the quiet and darkened room into a spectre vault. The fever in creased, and partial delirium came on, causing her unconsciously to talk of many things. Gentle and skilful hands ministered to her wants, and the voice of her attendant seemed to soothe, while it also carried her thoughts back to old days, and made her talk incessantly of and to Lily Day. Sometimes she recited poetry to her, pointing out her favourite lines, then breaking off into solemn warnings against Lily's being led away, through love of refinement or vanity, to be discontented with the station in which God had placed her. It was the second night, when, as it grew near dawn,"], [149, "\"A NEW LIGHT BREAKS ON ME!\" 141 and the night-light was flickering itself out in a spasmodic and melancholy way, Ellen was startled out of her plaintive, wandering talking, by the sound of deep, choking sobs. She looked round in wonder and fear, and her eyes fell on a head strangely famihar in its outline and attitude, bowed down on her bed, and seemingly in deepest sorrow. But for the sobs, the un mistakeable air of grief and life, she would have thought it part of her dream. Ellen, timidly, and with a half dread, put her hot and trembling hand on the soft hair, and with a smile of relief, whispered \u2014 \" Is it really Lily ? I have been dreaming of you so, Lily, and here you are, come to nurse me ! Have I been very iU ? Don't cry, I am better. Tell me all about it ! It is all so confusing \u2014 so odd \" Her hand was seized and covered with kisses and tears; but Lily neither looked up nor spoke, till the nurse came to announce the doctor. Then a pale, swollen, sorrowful face was slowly and reluctantly raised, she gave one long look at Ellen, and retired somewhat behind the curtains, with such a deep, wretched sigh, that Ellen's eyes followed her in utter surprise. She was, however, very weak, too much so to even try to understand the mystery. She tried to put it away from her, saying to herself, \" In time I shall know all, and only too soon. Meanwhile it is pleasant to see Lily's face.\" \"Not so bad,\" the doctor pronounced, after feeling her pulse, and then he inquired as to the night, &c. \" My wife sat up ; she will know,\" was the answer, in"], [150, "142 UPS AND DOWNS. a very low voice. Ellen did not know he had come in till then. \"Gently, my dear lady, don't start so! gently!\" said the doctor, who was still holding Ellen's hand. \" We must be very quiet, very calm.\" Then turning roimd, he added : \" A great deal of excitement and irritation, sir. But now \u2014 Mrs. Mortimer, may I speak to you a moment?\" And he kindly replaced Ellen's hand on the bed, and moved away to the further end of the room, followed by Lily, to whom he gave directions in a suppressed voice. How that day passed, Ellen never knew*. All she was clearly sensible of afterwards, was a raging desire to get away; but an utter inability to move hand or foot. Fever raged high. The doctor came and went. They bathed her temples, and held her hand ; they watched in anxious silence, or answered her wild and wailing speeches ; but she knew it not. Little was she aware once, when the cool and firm touch of a manly hand on her brow brought relief and sleep, what fearful strug gles, what pain, sorrow, and misery were close to her pillow ! The pang of her own grief was for the time deadened in bodily suffering. At last she slept. Gran ville Mortimer, pale from fatigue, retired from applying the iced water, and Lily took his place. They ex changed no words, and although she had been supposed to be resting, she looked hardly less worn and fagged"], [151, "\"A NEW LIGHT BREAKS ON ME ! \" 143 than he did, as with heavy, uncertain steps and down cast eyes, Lily obeyed his glance and quietly took the seat he left. As he went across the room to the door, her eyes followed him, with an almost wild look of anxiety. When he was gone, she clasped her hands together, and there she sat, motionless and bowed, for an hour. Lily looked older, although hers were those small and delicate features which long retain a look of youth, and but for her figure, even then, as she sat hi that shrouded hght, she might have been taken for a mere girl. Now and then she glanced at Ellen \u2014 once when doing so, she seemed to shudder slightly, and her fingers were tightly laced in each other ; but generally she remained with her eyes bent on the floor, quite still. About the middle of the night Ellen stirred and awoke. She looked at Lily directly \u2014 shut her eyes, but opened them again, and remained gazing at her face. Lily had not looked up, and was unconscious of her awakening ; she started a little when Ellen said, \" Are we alone ? \" She did not answer till the ques tion was repeated. \" Yes, quite alone. Are you better ? You have slept,\" she added, hastily. \" Tell me all then, Lily,\" Ellen said, fixing her eyes on her, and speaking in a solemn, authoritative manner, although the very sound of her voice showed how weak she was, and how great the effort to speak at all was. The colour flashed up in Lily's face, and then died away, as she moved in an agitated way. \" Tell me ! \" repeated Ellen. \" I can't ! I can't ! Oh, I dare not ! They say you"], [152, "144 UPS AND DOWNS. must be kept so quiet ! I knew it was foolish to have me here. The nurse would have been better, but he would have it so ! Oh, Miss Ellen\u2014 Miss Raymond ! \" she suddenly broke out, as if carried away at last, and unable to exercise any further control. \" My heart is breaking. Don't ask me anything \u2014 don't ! You saved my \u2014 our child \u2014 and I \" \" Tell me all, Lily ! \" \" Don't ask me ! He is so angry \u2014 so cruel ! and if I make you worse \" here she sobbed hysterically. Ellen's lips quivered, but she whispered, with great effort : \" Suspense will kill me. Remember ! I know nothing ! Now we two are here alone, tell me about this mystery, I beg.\" Lily wrung her hands, and moved to and fro in uncontrollable distress, but the sound of Ellen's voice had effect, and the old influence of the stronger character resumed its sway. She threw herself by the bedside on her knees, and hid her face, sobbing out \u2014 \" Well, then, if you will make me talk, what can I do ? Mind you say it is not my fault. He is in such a strange way already about \u2014 about you, and all ; so angry, so silent, and so stern ! Even the child is afraid \" \"What child?\" \" His child \u2014 my child ! The one you saved froin drowning. Don't you know ? \" \" I know nothing.\""], [153, "\"A NEW LIGHT BREAKS ON ME ! \" 145 \" Well, then, but for you, my child must have been drowned, so they tell me. His father reached the beach just in time to hear the nurse's screams, and saw you plunge in.\" \" It was his child, then ? \" \" His and mine.\" \" And you ! \u2014 you are \" I am his wife, \u2014 his wedded wife,\" Lily answered, sharply, and looking up for a moment, but only to bury her face again in the bed covering. There followed a little pause, and then Ellen said, in a low, weak, stifled voice, \" Since when ? \" Lily sobbed aloud. \" Since when ? \" Ellen repeated. \" Oh, since \u2014 more than \u2014 he married me before he left London.\" \" Was it soon after I saw you ? \" \" Yes, yes ; very soon \u2014 very soon ! \" Again Lily looked up, and met the gaze of Ellen's eyes, bright with fever and excitement. Apparently there was nothing to alarm her in the look, for she presently spoke fast, and as if wishing to unburden her mind. \" Yes ! And oh ! how I loved him ! I would have gone to the end of the world with him ! I was ready to be his slave! He was ill, very ill. And aunt always sent me up to his parlour to answer his bell. Sometimes, generally indeed, he did not notice me at all. Then again, he would speak a few words of thanks, so gently, so kindly ! And then I began vol. rn. L"], [154, "146 UPS AND DOWNS. to read to him. I don't know how it began. At first it was the newspaper, for it made his head ache to read to himself\u2014 and then it got to other things. He used to give me advice, too ; and told me that mine would be a trying position. Oh, God ! he warned me as a brother might. All ! it was like some happy, fairy dream, too happy, too good to be true ! \" She ceased for a moment, and pushed back her loosened hair with a weary gesture, looking up at Ellen, apparently lost to all but the keen interest of the subject, and led on to talk of it by some unconscious impulse. It was as if the bare recollection was plea sant. And Ellen's earnest, watchful attention and half whispered word of encouragement to go on, added greater impetus. \"And did he love you so very much?\" Ellen asked once, as Lily paused. A quick change came over her face as she drooped her eyes and coloured up. \" Well, no, perhaps ; how could he?\" she hesitated. \" No, I knew he didn't ! he never said he did,\" she added, quickly ; \" but, oh ! he was always kind and gentle. Yes ; for all his grave, stern looks, he can be gentle enough. But last night \u2014 yesterday, he was all changed \u2014 cruel, harsh, hard ! It is all over now, I know, God help me ! But, oh ! better the child had died than \u2014 than ' Hush,' you say ? but I mean it. He hates me now ; but he can't undo it. I am his wife; but he hates me ! What shall I do ? What"], [155, "\"A NEW LIGHT BREAKS ON ME!\" 147 can I do?\" And she burst into a fit of piteous weeping. \" Why should he hate you now, Lily ? Of course, he loved you a little, if \u2014 if he asked you to marry him,\" EUen said, in a faint voice. \" I don't know that \u2014 I don't know ! You see I fretted myself quite ill when he grew better, and I saw but httle of him, for I knew he was going away. I grew pale and thin. I could hardly walk up-stairs ; and though, of course, I never said a word to a soul, I believe aunt guessed how it was ; and I suspected then what I know since, that she told him what was the cause of my illness. It was very wrong, very shameful of her ! I thought I should have died of shame when first I guessed it, and if I had been well enough, I would have gone away and never faced him again. And, oh ! wouldn't it have been well for me, \u2014 well for all, if I had. It was all a dream, a beautiful dream ! But the waking is hard, Miss Ellen, very hard and bitter.\" \" It is, indeed,\" Ellen whispered, with a long sigh. \"One evening,\" Lily went on, \u2014 but looking at her patient, she suddenly remembered to give her the medicine, and then becoming aware how tired Ellen was, she suggested their being silent, fearing mischief would result. But Ellen urged her to go on and tell all \u2014 it would relieve her mind and do no harm. \" Well ! \" she continued. \" It had been a very hard, bad day. Aunt so cross and fussy, and so coarse and disagreeable, and I had been ill, and not able to sleep L 2"], [156, "148 UPS AND DOWNS. or rest. Aunt went out to shop, and I was so glad of the quiet, when I found myself alone in her little parlour ! I lay with my eyes shut, thinking and think- ing, as usual ; half wishing I was going to die, for life seemed all so very miserable, \u2014 when I heard the street- door open and shut. I knew it could only be aunt or he, and I knew the step quite well, on the stairs and overhead. He seemed to be pacing up and down, as he often did ; I liked to listen to it ; when quite suddenly the door of the .parlour opened, and there he was. A little kind of colour came into his face, as he said something about my aunt being out. I know I was shaking all over, when I asked if there was anything I could do for him. He came close to me, looking quite ashy pale and fixed ; and he said ' Yes ; there was one thing I could do for him, and that he meant to tell me what,' but then he stopped. I was looking at him, for his voice sounded very oddly, and then I saw such a spasm of pain, it seemed to me, pass over his face ; I put a chair, and asked if I should fetch him some water or wine, and if he was ill ? He laid his hand on my arm, and said, ' No ; sit down.' Then he drew his chair near to me, all in a slow, deliberate way, and then he looked at me and smiled ; \u2014 that smile he has now and then, grave and kind, and lighting up his eyes. He said, 'How is it you look so wan and pale, Lily ? Is this the way to get on, ambitious as you are ? Tell me, have you been out to-day ? No ! \u2014 Then yesterday ? Health is too precious a gift to be neglected wilfully, little girl : '"], [157, "\"A NEW LIGHT BREAKS ON ME!\" 149 he used sometimes to call me so. I believe the tears were in my eyes when I said I did not care to go out. ' But why so ? ' he asked. ' Do you feel lonely ? Is the world hard, and cold, and unsympathising ? Have you awoke from pleasant dreams of loving and being loved, to find it all a cheat and a sham ? ' As he spoke in his most touching voice, almost as if he was talking to himself and from his very heart, my heart seemed to ache, and a choking feeling came to my throat. I could not have said a word then. But there was no occasion. He went on, and let me shed tears without any remark. Do you know I can hear his voice now \u2014 always, when I try to bring it back. But never, never again shall I really hear it so ! Never ! I can't exactly recall what he said: I wish I could; but I remember his saying, ' We all live to find ourselves deceived or dis appointed. Hope grows up like grass, is cut down, or it withers ; and yet we live on ! We must live, and we must work. And the noisy world goes on its way forgetful of the mourning solitary ones. Yes, Lily, here you sit pining your young life away for what perhaps can never be yours ; and up-stairs I sit, a sour, solitary, disappointed man, whose best hopes are cut down ; but I must live and work on, never theless. \" ' I am about to leave this country, perhaps for years. No one but my mother will ever miss me. I must go alone, and dwell among strangers, my fire side lonely. Yes ; I shall miss my room above. I shall not again find those gentle, pleasant cares, which"], [158, "150 UPS AND DOWNS. have been bestowed on me here. I cannot hope or ex pect to find a Lily Day there.' By this time I was fairly sobbing, and had turned aside, ashamed of myself. He again put his hand on my shoulder, and stopped speak ing. I wished he would go on, \u2014 go on for ever ! It w*as like some music, touching and sad, but sweet. Then he took my two hands, and drew them away from my face, and stooped down and looked at me. He forced me to look at him too. I couldn't help myself. Did you ever look deep down into his eyes? \u2014 What am I saying? of course, you have not ! Well, after looking at me, as if he chose to read my very heart, he said, ' Lily has a kind heart, I know. She is sorry for me. Will she, \u2014 can she, leave all \u2014 leave England, for my sake ? ' Then dropping my hands, his voice became more grave. ' Lily, listen \\ ' he said. ' You know I am unhappy ; I am not bright or cheerful tempered, not even affec tionate, naturally, and now there is a blight on me \u2014 perhaps always will be. If you \"will be my wife, I will to the best of my ability be a good husband to yon. If you will share my fortunes, I will try to shelter you from some of the hard trials of life, to which, as a gover ness, you may be peculiarly exposed. It may be but a choice of evil. Think of it. Look on your present prospects, they are not perhaps very bright ; compare them with the position of wife to a disappointed and morose man.' \" I don't know at all what I said, when I did muster up courage to speak. I believe I was very silly. He has told me so since. But I loved him too well to hide it ;"], [159, "\"A NEW LIGHT BREAKS ON ME!\" 151 and I must say, he took no advantage of me, but treated me with respect and even reverence, then and always. And when he drew my head on to his shoulder and stroked my hair, and called me his own foolish, but kind, hmocent Lily, I felt as if I had reached heaven ; I was almost afraid to breathe, for fear I should find it a dream. But I remember that he never, either then, or at any other time, said that he loved me. Yet \u2014 I believed he did. Yes ! I am sure, hi a way he did too. And I didn't care, I loved him so much ! too much ! \" No objection was raised. My aunt was only too well pleased at her niece's marrying a gentleman. He was short and stern with her, but gave her money to keep the secret strictly, which she did. Not a soul was to know of it. Aunt kept her word, and, poor soid ! she died after we left. We were married, and went to Ostend that day. In church he nearly fainted. The sexton had to fetch water. He was very ill for a long time after. A weary time it was \u2014 all among foreigners. I almost feared he would die. But I nursed him night and day, and I loved him more and more. He was grateful and kind. I lost my first child, and then I was ill, and he did for me as much as I had done for him. He was always grave and sad, and very silent. But I used to sit with my sewing in my hands, and look at him while he wrote. He was always writing ; and when he was tired I used to read to him, or we took long walks. He was very kind, and always patient and gentle. When our boy was born, I did hope he would rejoice more, and be brighter, perhaps ;"], [160, "152 UPS AND DOWNS. but he only shed tears. I grew to understand him better, and, of course, I did know that he had a sore heart \u2014 very sore! Sometimes I was jealous, for I felt I gave him so much, and it was hard never to win any back ! for the old wound never to heal ! \u2014 and sometimes, my fault \u2014 that sin \u2014 oh ! it stared me in the face and frightened me. Yet, once, before we were married, when I said I was not his equal, or a fit match for him, he said ' All the better. The more chance of my being an exception to the rule, and remaining true. He had been disgusted, and w*ounded to the heart's core, but he had found one to love him, after all ; didn't I love him ? ' he asked, more than once. And oh ! I did. I did ! \" \" But, Lily,\" said Ellen, speaking with great effort, \" all this time, where \u2014 what did you do w*ith that note ? Do you remember it ? \" \" Remember ! \u2014 why, that's it ! That is what I mean \u2014 what has brought all this misery on me ! Oh, I see it all plainly now. But don't look so ! Ellen Raymond, do you hear? For God's sake don't look so angry ! Forgive me \u2014 do ! \" she added, wildly, and forgetful of all due precaution, seizing Ellen's broken arm. \" Didn't Mrs. Wentworth tell you, then ? \" she went on excitedly ; \" she said she would ! She took it away! Oh, my God, that ever I let her! She told me it would do you great harm if it was delivered, and that the greatest kindness I could do you, would be to give it to her. That you yourself would be the first to say so afterwards. She told me you had been"], [161, "\"A NEW LIGHT BREAKS ON ME !\" 153 ill-advised, and had acted under impulse. That, in fact, you were sacrificing yourself to an imaginary duty, considering yourself bomid by some foolish, childish words, long since repented. That if you were free, you would marry happily. She did, Miss Ellen ! She said so. And I let her take the note, God pardon me ! I never knew all I had done till afterwards. I guessed it before, I knew it after we were married. Then it was too late. I never wished to see you again. I hoped you would marry, and forget, and be happy. I must be very wicked ; but, do you know, when my child was given back to me, and I knew you had saved him, when I saw my husband's face, and saw what he was feeling, and oh ! when I heard his stern words, I could have wished the child drowned! Yes; dead in the sea, rather than be saved by you ! Now, don't look so at me ! Pity me ! I wish I was dead ! Oh, I wish I was ! \" Sobs and moans choked all further words ; and on Ellen's face the fever spots were burning deeper and hotter, and her eyes were wild and glassy. Her senses were no longer clear, nor did she understand, though it moved her, why Lily was weeping so wildly. Fortunately, the unusual sound reached watchful ears. Granville, having knocked at the door in vain, and hearing his wife's voice, came in. He raised her from Ellen's bed, where she had again buried her face. \"Is this the way you nurse a sick person?\" he said, angrily. \" Do you mean to kill her?\""], [162, "154 UPS AND DOWNS. In a moment she was quiet, all but a convulsive sob or two. \" She would have me talk,\" she said, in a deprecating tone ; but he turned from her, giving a cooling draught with his own hands to Ellen, who, after gazing wildly at him, laughed loud, in an hysterical, delirious way. \" Oh, Granville,\" she said, \" how cross you look ! Mamma w*ill scold you ; you have been writing poetry, I know ! \" This, sounding so strange at that moment, together with the shrill and unmeaning laugh, thoroughly upset Lily. Granville took her out of the room and fetched the nurse. Soon the doctor was sent for, and for two days Ellen's life hung on a tliread. Lily came near her no more. Granville stole in and out now and then, but she did not know him. She talked much of old days when she and Bessie had first known and played with him. Once she fancied she had offended him, and, begging his pardon, said \u2014 \" I know you are too fond of me to be really very angry. I understand that look and manner. But it is not pleasant, Gran, so let us make up and be friends.\" He was standing by her bed as she said this. With sudden impulse he stooped and kissed her hot and wasted hand, and then rushed out of the room. He did not return there again till, when she at last grew better, he assisted in wheeling her chair into the sitting room."], [163, "155 CHAPTER XI. EXPLANATIONS. Ellen struggled through her illness, with all its aggra vation of agitation, to convalescence. It was a strange returning to health and to common habits of life. But at first she was too weak to do more than wonder at herself in Granville's house \u2014 a visitor in his home ! When first she was able to be with them for a short time, there was perhaps more of pleasure than pain. After all, life was sweet and precious; and ease after acute pain brings its own intrinsic happiness. All the painful points crept in aftenvards. There came a time, and only too quickly, when she was made again keenly conscious of a deep heart wound, of a darkened future, a complete overthrow of all her previous hopes and habits of thought. Yet it was like the moth and the flame ; she dictated letters to Bessie, assuring her of her comfort and well-doing, and expressing her desire to remain on where she was, as her host had urged. As she grew better, she also became restless ; and was always looking out for some opportunity of continuing the subject of the past with Lily. It lay like a dead weight on her heart. She longed for greater certainty,"], [164, "156 UPS AND DOWNS. more knowledge ; even though it should, and, in fact, must be, all pain. She only half understood, and was too weak to guess. This protracted anxiety, for Lily studiously avoided any private intercourse, retarded her recovery. She never could see Lily alone ! When they met it was in the common sitting-room, or in a drive, or a row on the quiet river, which seemed to do Ellen more good than anything else. At these times Lily was silent, or if she did speak, there was a sharp, irritable tone in her voice. Granville had entirely resumed his usual self-control. He looked very pale and worn, but he always exerted himself to talk, and seemed never to overlook or forget even a trifle w*hich could add to Ellen's comfort. He was polite and attentive, even gentle to his wife ; but it did not take very long for Ellen to discover that all was not well between them. She saw many faults in Lily both as wife and mother, and persuaded herself that when she really knew more about it, she could use her old influence to work on Lily for good. The past was gone, she said to herself. However it had come about, what had hap pened was irrevocable. It was best to meet and stifle it at once. It would be cowardly folly to flee from it. Better look it in the face now and at once. Then there was nothing whatever to alarm her. If there had been looks and tones \u2014 they \"were vanished now. The first painful surprise being over, it was far better to stay and assume at once the new relation into which they were thrown. Why not still be friends ?"], [165, "EXPLANATIONS. 157 She could not but see that her presence was welcome to him ; and Lily, also, had at times shown almost her old affection. Lily's happiness was dear to her and very sacred. Her presence might serve to secure it, since who but an old and loving friend would be likely to point out the pitfalls ? In fact, \u2014 it was the old tale. A voice whispered soft and pleasant flattery, and con science became shy and dumb. Self-deception sat at the helm, the sails were spread, the wind fair, and to go down the stream is always pleasant and easy ! When well enough to bear his restless ways and prattle, the child became a source of interest to Ellen. She grieved over what she fancied was his mother's mismanagement, and learnt the way to quell his easily roused passionate temper. Bessie might have been surprised, had she seen the pains Ellen took to win that boy's love. She succeeded ; and it became a difficult matter to keep him from hurting her, weak as she still was. Sometimes Lily would call the boy away in a sharp and displeased tone, though at others she was both proud and happy in Ellen's notice of him. It was doubtful if the father observed it at all. He scarcely ever spoke of his child, though his manner was always kind and patient to him ; and Ellen was annoyed at Lily's constantly using the father's name as a bugbear to frighten the child into goodness. Once, when she remonstrated, Lily answered, that even if it did make him love his father less, he deserved it for not taking more notice of his own boy; and, she added, \" that it was only lately, for before Ellen came,"], [166, "158 UPS AND DOWNS. Granville had never liked to lose sight of the child, and seemed wrapped up in him.\" One afternoon the three were sitting together. A faint and unsuccessful attempt had been made at con versation between the two ladies, but Lily spoke fretfully and seemed ill at ease, wdiile Ellen was much oppressed and considering when she might be able to undertake the journey home. For the last two days such a coldness and constraint had crept over the party, she almost fancied her presence to be displeasing. Lily avoided being alone with her more than ever, and Granville's manner had lost its pleasantness. He was strikingly stiff and formal, taking, as it seemed to her, every possible opportunity to mark the distance he wished maintained, while at moments there was positive displeasure and annoyance in his tone and look. Lily was more restless than ever. Settling to no one occu pation, but watching her husband sometimes with sad depression, sometimes with an offended, suspicious air; while almost every w*ord betokened no common state of irritation. There was an uncomfortable atmosphere throughout the household, and the child's temper had more out breaks than usual. Ellen was leaning on her elbow, her hand covering her eyes, glancing from the wife to the husband, as each sat apart and silent, feeling in her own mind that this kind of life was wretched, and that the sooner she could get away the better. She was wondering how much Granville had told Bessie. Ellen, being only able to write by dictating to Lily,"], [167, "EXPLANATIONS. 159 had passed over all details. But she knew that Gran ville had written, and had received more than one letter. Had he spoken of his marriage ? Did Bessie know who was his w*ife? This train of thought was interrupted by the boisterous entrance of little Master Edward Mortimer, who at once ran up to Ellen, and leaning on her knee, struggled with childish urgency to be allowed to ransack her basket, a very favourite amusement of his. She stroked his curls and asked him some questions first, meaning to give him the basket presently, when his father said angrily, and so as to make both Ellen and the child start : \" What are you about there ? Come away directly ! Lily, why do you allow that child to tease Miss Ray mond so ? \" Lily looked vexed, but did not speak or move. The boy's hps quivered, and he looked doubtfully from Ellen to his father. \" Let him stay,\" Ellen pleaded. \" You, who hate children so much, to submit to that spoilt boy's humours ! \" was the answer, in a mocking and even bitter tone, while he resumed the newspaper, w*hich entirely concealed his face. EUen's heart swelled as she stooped over the child. An irresistible impulse urged her to speak as she felt, without her habitual reserve : \" He is the child of \u2014 of those I care for, \u2014 the child of my friends,\" and a few tears fell even on the curly head. The basket was given, and Edward took it into a quiet corner, without another word. The flush died"], [168, "160 UPS AND DOWNS. away from Ellen's face, leaving her pale, and cold, and nervous. No answer came, the large sheet of news was as a screen between them. Lily rose up, and after turning about a book or two, she left the room. A noisy buzzing fly careered round and round, and a breeze stirred the plants in the window, and lifted some loose papers lying on the table. The silence was oppressive. Ellen felt hurt, and if she could have done so without help, she would gladly have gone away, to seek some relief in sohtude to her overstrained feelings. But in the presence of Granville, sitting there, so unapproachable, so stern, and so silent, she felt the necessity of not giving way. She leant back her head against the high chair, and with her left hand wiped quietly away a tear or two, when with one stride, as it seemed, he crossed the room, and was close beside her. \" You do care for me then ! you call us friends ? \" He spoke eagerly, and in the old voice ; that voice of which his mother had said, that, whether Granville sang best or not, there was at times a music in his voice which not one of the others had. The words were little enough : it was the tremor, the earnestness of the appeal which expressed all, and moved her to the very bottom of her heart. She was wholly overcome for the moment : she could not speak, and she turned her face away from his searching look. \" If you will let me speak,\" he began ; but his voice broke down, and again he resumed in a sharper key, and rapidity of utterance, which told of great agitation. \" So much has happened, so much is changed to us"], [169, "EXPLANATIONS. 161 both \u2014 to all \u2014 since we met.

Surely it is not intended for our two lives to run apart and separate. Surely we ought \u2014 we must be friends ! \" \" Yes,\" she said, forcing herself to speak ; \" it is not exactly my fault if we are not.\" She paused, but as he did not speak, she went on, gaining courage, as she fancied him to have resumed some of his wonted control and quietness. \" Why have you been so silent all this long \u2014 this weary time ? never writing, or telling any one of \u2014 of your marriage, or anything about you. Have you told Bessie even now ? \" \" She knows me to be a married man,\" he answered, shortly. \" But did you tell her who your wife is ? \" Ellen went on, again colouring deeply. \" No.\" \"Nor your own family? Lily's friends have been sorely uneasy.\" \"Why so?\" \" At the uncertainty about her fate, of course.\" \" I was not aware of any friends, saving yourself, and I stipulated for secrecy. I told her and her aunt that I should require silence. She has no right to complain,\" he said, coldly. \" She does not. I only meant you might have VOL. III.

I did not suppose the fact of my marriage would be any great satisfaction to them. But I had a right to please myself. To whom did I owe any explanation?\" he said, with increasing bitterness and stiffness. \" I, for one, could not help being very uneasy and unhappy about Lily,\" she half whispered : \" what could I think?\" \"Did you not receive an assurance that all was well ? \" \" Yes, once, from her aunt ; but I dared not trust to her quite. I did not know that her * well ' was what I could like. It would have been a great relief to know \" \" The fact,\" he interrupted ; \" yo'u would then have been quite content \u2014 quite happy, had you known her to be my wife ?\" His voice was low, sarcastic, yet ftdl of pain. She only noticed the last. \"Uncertainty and sus pense are never easy to bear,\" she said, evasively, but in a soothing tone, for she dreaded the look in his eye, and the set of the lip, which he was gnawing till it nearly bled. \" Secrecy hi such matters hardly ever does good,\" she added. \" Perhaps not,\" he said, rising and going to the window ; \" but I had my reasons. Perhaps I felt there was nothing in the marriage to call for the usual commonplace congratulations. I hate all argument"], [171, "EXPLANATIONS. 163 and cavil.

I hardly know what has caused me to break my rule. Pray, rest! I will leave you.\" But before doing so, he came to pick up one of her pillows which had fallen, and placed it comfortably. \" I have been wrong ; but, M 2"], [172, "164 UPS AND DOWNS. you shall see, I won't transgress again.\" He spoke in his ordinary grave, dry manner now.

She looked up at him as a child might do Avho felt the obstinate fit rising. He gave an impatient but shght exclamation, which she understood and resented, poor thing, in her present mood ; though at other times nothing galled her more than any suspicion of his indifference or want of observation regarding her appearance. \" Don't keep the woman all day,\" he remarked, sharply. \" No one has told me of her being here. I am not going either. Do you suppose I don't see \u2014 don't know what you mean ? Don't I feel that you are making an excuse just to be rid of me ? Yes, I understand ! But I will bear it no longer. I will stay here.

Why did you ever dare to deceive me and marry me ? \" She was carried on now by the violence of her feelings to break down all barriers, forgetful for the moment of her habitual awe of him. Like a passionate child, she was wringing her hands, and crying and talking vehemently, saying words which perhaps could never be forgotten : almost unconscious of what she did say. He came close to her, and quietly caught hold of her hand. His eyes glowed, and his w*hole countenance showed extreme anger, though it was anger held in as yet under a firm curb. \" What are you saying ? How dare you to say that I deceived you ! In what ? Do you hear \u2014 ? How ? \" She looked up at him and tried in vain to pull away her hand ; for one instant she quailed ; but at that moment Ellen stirred, perhaps to remind them of her presence and her inability to leave them unaided. Quickly the blood rushed again into Lily's face, while she strove desperately, though vainly, to wrench away her hand from his iron grasp. \" Yes ; you did deceive me ! You married me when you loved another woman, and you never told me so ! What if you didn't get the paltry note ?

What is it? \u2014 what note ? and where is it ? And what had you to do with it?\" Ellen winced at the exceeding severity of his manner. But Lily only raved on in bitter accusations and wail ing, and seemed not to heed his words, or his eye which so keenly questioned her. \" She means a note which I asked her to give you, with some books of yours, in London \u2014 that time,\" Ellen tried to say, feeling it right to have matters clearly explained. Directly she spoke, in a low and measured voice which could not quite hide the in ward tremor, he let go his wife's hand and turned suddenly round, so as to face Ellen. After looking at her fixedly for a moment, he said, \" You wrote then to me ! May I ask \u2014 was it only about the books, or \u2014 or hi fact \u2014 There was a question, \u2014 do you remember? Was it answered ? \u2014 Speak ! \" \" It was ! \" The silence which followed her half-whispered answer, was like the stillness which precedes a storm. Perhaps they all three felt it so, for still as they each remained, an increase of tension, a gathering up of all possible strength \u2014 a sense of coming horror"], [178, "170 UPS AND DOWNS. \u2014 seemed to pass like a breath over all, causing an almost perceptible trembling. He was looking at the carpet, then turning again to his wife, he said, in a wonderfully low, almost voice less tone, \"And that note \u2014 that answer, as I under stand \u2014 pray, let me be clear \u2014 correct me if I am wrong \u2014 was confided to your care ? \" A pause \u2014 and then he added, \" I demand to know what became of it ! \" She gave a shriek, and threw herself back with frantic force on her chair. \" You have heard her say that she gave it up \u2014 that another took it from her,\" put in Ellen. \" Granville ! don't be hard on her ; don't ! \" \" Hard !

Tell me, tell me ! w*hat did you say?\" he urged, coming close to her, and at once dropping the forced levity and sarcasm of his previous manner. She looked up at him, then down on the ground. \" I said \u2014 I said \u2014 But what matter, now, what I said?\" she broke off, with sharp pain in her voice. \" It is all over.

In truth her small stock of bodily strength was nearly exhausted. \" I dare say you are right,\" he resumed, trying hard to speak gently, and approaching her side again. \" Well, we will not speak of the past, since that shocks you so. But remember, Ellen, I claim your friend ship ! Your presence here alone can make life bearable. It will be best for me \u2014 best for \u2014 for my wife. You have already seen enough to know the character of our married life, to understand the kind of husband and wife we make. I assure you that we shall be the better for a friend. You must be this friend ; in spite of that child's burst of temper.\" He spoke in a forced way, putting constraint on himself. \" Well ; let us forget this \u2014 this. . . . Forgive me ! \" She held out her hand, even while he spoke, and he seized it eagerly and pressed it to his brow and lips; then without another word he left the room. Presently the servant came, by her master's orders she said, to see if Miss Raymond required anything. Ellen was glad to be helped to her ow*n room for needful rest, when she heard that Lily had also gone to lie down. Ellen did not appear again that evening, but she heard that \" Master \" had gone out for a long walk ; and he did not return till very late at night. Mrs. Mortimer had fallen asleep, complaining of headache."], [184, "176 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER XIII. PLAYING WITH EDGED TOOLS. A change took place in the intercourse between the three persons whom the waves of life had first separated and then thrown together so strangely. After the outburst which had occurred, it was but natural for them to feel shy, uncertain, and conscious, when they again1 met. Of the three, Lily showed it the least, and Ellen the most. There was a painful con straint in her manner, and she had also visibly retro graded in her way towards health. Instead of several hours, she now only came down-stairs for a short time, and she looked paler, and trembled more. Sometimes she questioned the wisdom or even the pleasure of remaining where she was ; for she felt hers to be a false position, and longed to be quite well again, that she might act with her usual independence. She was troubled about Granville and his wife, at Lily's uncon trolled temper and uncomfortable management. Yet she tried to persuade herself that their domestic discord arose more from those faults, only too common to married life, than from any extraordinary or deeper cause. This she tried to persuade herself of, but who"], [185, "PLAYLNG WITH EDGED TOOLS. 177 knows the pang it was, when she saw the effect of the wife's fretfulness and temper on him ? or the pain when Lily's unwise, petulant reproaches, that \"he did not care for his wife,\" found an echo in her own heart ? These troublous thoughts, and a sharp pain in her injured arm, retarded her recovery, and made her nights sleep less, and her days nervous and uneasy. Granville left them, on business in London he said, for a few days. On his return, there was a visible alteration. He brought a new spirit with him, and talked more perhaps than he had ever done. He resolutely shut his eyes, and neither saw nor heard gloomy looks or fretful speeches. He brought books and prints, and hired a pianoforte, after which he proposed singing to them. Ellen silently wondered, and Lily spoke out her surprise at his good spirits ! He answered that success ought to bring joy, and his last work had succeeded far beyond his utmost hopes. He should go on with fresh spirit now; and he did work regularly every morning, after which he devoted himself to the drawing-room, reading aloud, or talking, or singing, and ever proposing some pleasant excursion to the different points of scenery in the neighbourhood. The constraint vanished. Ellen accepted what she saw he wished understood, and her own fears and doubts gave way under the present pleasure. She allowed herself to follow this smooth path, shrink ing from too close investigation of her own feelings ; only saying to herself sometimes, that, hard as had VOL. III. N"], [186, "178 UPS AND DOWNS. been the overthrow of her happiness, she might surely receive what was now offered her without harm. Over and over again she tried to feel, that at last she was learning content and resignation. To prove this, she constantly spoke of Lily's marriage and of her husband and child, as a friend might naturally do. And when the sound of his footstep made her pulse beat quicker, she accounted for it in this way : \u2014 \" He is so cheerful, it is inspiriting. Now, Lily, here is your husband coming, and you will cheer up.\" Her own danger she ignored. The one draw*back was Lily's temper, w*hich after the first became almost more uncertain and trying than before. This would sometimes draw forth a bitter or sarcastic speech from liim, though, on the whole, he bore with her wonder fully well. Ellen ventured to scold Lily for her conduct, and for not trying to be more of a companion to her husband, instead of turning away sharply, if he ever chanced to ask her opinion or appealed to her taste. She was also very exigeante, and fired up directly at any fancied neglect on his part. But he was too studiously courteous and attentive for this to happen often. He seemed to have laid down a certain line of conduct, which he strictly carried out, and Ellen forgot, when she upheld him as an attentive husband, that the politest service may be only pain, if love is lacking. One day it so happened that Lily was more than commonly \" put out\" by some household w*orries. Her husband had listened quietly to her passionate relation"], [187, "PLAYING WITH EDGED TOOLS. 179 of her wrongs, and then turned the conversation, addressing Ellen about a book she had been reading. This gave great offence to Lily, who burst into tears, as she sat pouring out the tea at breakfast. He looked at her, but took no notice, and Ellen hoped it might pass. Granville left them sooner than usual, and went to his work. But poor Lily was sore and vexed, and her fretfulness infected the child. At last, after much battling, little Edward fell into one of his most violent fits of passion, very frightful to see. The mother was utterly powerless to quiet him, and called for his father. Granville obeyed the sum mons, but directly he saw how it was, he gave a look of angry- disgust, mingled with great sadness, muttered something about, \"weakness and folly,\" and left the room again, begging he might not be disturbed for \" such nonsense ! \" \" There ! \" exclaimed Lily. \" That is the way ! He always leaves it to me ! He is so selfish and cruel ! Is it my doing that this child has such a temper? I should like to know from w*hom he got it ! What am I to do ? His father ought to beat him, of course ; but when I said so before, he sneered at me, and said he made over all that to me : that mothers were the proper managers of children, that unless I gave the boy entirely and wholly up to his management, he would have nothing to do with him.\" \" And surely he is right. A mother is the proper person,\" Ellen said. But meanwhile the child's screams were really terrible to hear. Lily, with flushed cheeks N 2"], [188, "180 UPS AND DOWNS. and trembling limbs, only made him worse ; and in vain did Ellen try all her coaxing and soothing : the little fellow was mad with passion, and Ellen feared what might be the consequences. But again the door opened, and Granville appeared. He bent a grave look on the frantic child, and then said quietly, but in a tone of authority, \" Come here ! \" The screaming ceased for a moment, and the child looked up astonished at his father. \" Come here ! \" was repeated with quiet sternness, aud he went. His father lifted him in his arms, and without another word went away with him, while the screaming burst out afresh. \"He will kill him,- he will kill him!\" Lily called out, at the same time hurrying after them. \" Nonsense, Lily ; do trust your husband : it is his own child,\" Ellen said, warmly. \" He looked so dreadful ! No, don't prevent me ; I will go \u2014 he shan't touch him : my boy \u2014 my child \u2022' It is no business of yours,\" she added, angrily, as Ellen laid a detaining hand on her. \" I can't think why you interfere between me and my husband ! \" And she hurried out of the room. What happened Ellen knew not. She leant back in her couch and covered her head, to exclude the piercing cries of the child, thinking with pain that her once loved and petted pupil, Lily Day, should have turned out so faulty. Soon the cries ceased, and all was silent. No one came to the room. Hours went by, and the usual luncheon time was long past, when"], [189, "PLAYING WITH EDGED TOOLS. 181 the door was gently opened, and Granville himself looked in. \" Have you been here all this time ? \" \" Yes.\" \" Come to lunch,\" and he offered his arm : \" you are tired, I see. It is fresh and pleasant without. I will carry your cushion to the high rock \u2014 will you come ? \" Ellen consented, and asked where Lily was. \" Asleep. The child also ; both on the same bed. Poor tired-out children !\" She was struck with the weary sadness of the smile and tone, and unconsciously echoed his sigh. \" I fear \u2014 I am sure, that this morning's work has hurt you,\" he said ; \" but we won't talk of it. I choose to think \u2014 I cherish the notion, whether true or not \u2014 that you are too real a friend to be utterly disgusted with us and our wretched mistakes. It needs some little moral courage to brave your criticism, however. He paused a little. \"I wish, though \u2014 I like you to see and know all: so far I am 'cruel,' poor Lily's favourite epithet for me. I like you to know the truth \u2014 to know the extent of the punishment you have condemned me to.\" \"What can you mean?\" she asked, looking up at him. He stopped a little, with a searching, almost reproach ful glance. Then he turned away. \"Put on your bonnet, and let us go out. I can explain my meaning on the rock, if you wish for it\u2014 not here.\""], [190, "182 UPS AND DOWNS. But Ellen was eager to introduce other subjects, and apparently careful to allude to nothing which might bring on the explanation. He followed her lead, and they fell into that kind of light but pleasant talk suggested by the scene. Then he went back to his travelling experiences, and she heard much of what she had once longed to know, though too proud and sore to ask, of his sojourn in Italy and Egypt. He threw off all reserve, and kindled Avith his subject ; she, sitting on the rock, listening with half-closed eyes, carried away as in a pleasant dream, and realizing the scenes he described so well, when suddenly he broke from his subject and said \u2014 \"And so you and Bessie keep house together in the old place ; and instead of being an heiress, Ellen Raymond is poor, and paints portraits?\" \" Even so,\" she said, smiling at his abruptness. \" And,\" she added, \"it is a great comfort to have Bessie again all to myself.\" \" But the children ? \" \" Ah, I understand your smile ! I see you cherish np all my faults. But I assure you we are very good friends : I don't think they hate me.\" \"Hate you? cherish your faults? Well \u2014 perhaps it would be better for me to do so. Ellen, may I ask \u2014 will you forgive the question ? \u2014 but what is be come of Mr. Vaughan ? I mean, how is it you are not his wife ? Every letter led me to believe that so it was to be. Why so long a delay ? \" \" Because it is never to be.\""], [191, "PLAYING WITH EDGED TOOLS. 183 \"Never? He can't be mercenary. Surely it is not \" \" He is all that is good and generous. My fast and firm friend \u2014 the friend of us all,\" she interrupted with earnestness. \" Indeed ! And only a friend ? That is strange.\" \"Is it?\" \" Yes, it certainly is : I don't understand it. Such an unexceptionable match: and besides, really I can't quite believe you are to be a single lady.\" He looked at her quickly. She was flushed and uncomfortable. \" Surely it is odd,\" he repeated, half absently. She moved her hand nervously among the rough limpet shells \u2014 her eyes were cast down, her lips quiver ing, so that she bit them to hide it. \" Ellen ! \" It was but her own name. He often called her so ; but now it agitated her almost beyond her power of control. She felt his eyes were on her ! and, greatly distressed, just as his hand approached hers, she ex claimed \u2014 \" Don't ! Oh, don't talk of all this ! \" He drew back his hand. \" Let us go home,\" she said. \" No,\" he answered huskily. \" You must not leave me. Remain here a little while longer. But you are right : we won't talk of it. Only \u2014 thank God ! you are here \u2014 are not his wife ! Yes, thank Heaven for that, at any rate ; whatever be the reason.\""], [192, "184 UPS AND DOWNS. He drew one of those painful, quivering sighs, which come from the very life, and turned away from the rock ; walking slowly towards the sea, which was flowing in gently. This gave her time to recover from all the anguish and all the bliss w*hich had darted through her so suddenly. Yet she dreaded the walk home, and would fain have escaped from him. But his manner reassured her. If she could not help fancying his touch was even more gentle and supporting than before, and his voice lower, there was nothing in w*ord or look to remind her of the deeply impassioned eagerness of those few words which had escaped from him. He took up the subject almost where he had dropped it, and a listener might have believed them ordinary acquaintance, unusually full of interest for the poor abused Egyptian serfs of whom he spoke. They found Lily down-stairs on their return, com plaining a little of headache ; but quiet and gentle, and far less captious than was common with her. Late in the evening, before the lamp was lighted, Granville sang, accompanying himself. He did not ask what he should sing, but chose for himself; and they were mostly wild, quaint German ballads. Those deep, full notes, with the soft and distant rush of the sea to fill up the pauses \u2014 if it could but go on always so, Ellen thought : if there was no rude awakening from all the undefined, intoxicating sweetness of that hour ! But even then there was an unconscious prevision of change \u2014 a sword hanging by a hair. The very mur mur of those waves was saying what she dared not"], [193, "PLAYING WITH EDGED TOOLS. 185 then hearken to; and when the song ceased, she suddenly shut the window, saying that the sound w*as too melan choly. He drew near, and stood beside her. No one spoke ; but a sound of sobs broke that stillness. Lily, sitting apart, unheeded, and, as Ellen had fancied, half asleep, could control herself no longer. To her also the music and the waves had spoken. \" Are you tired ? \" asked her husband, going to her. She shook his hand away, and said, \" No.\" \" What is it then ? \" \" Never mind. Only a headache ! The music makes my head ache, I believe. But it is no matter. Sing on ! \" \" No, I will not,\" he said, twisting one of her long curls round his fingers. \" At least, not till you are gone to bed.\" \" Oh, that will be worse,\" she said, half crying. \" But pray don't mind me at all. What is a headache after all ? \" \" A very unpleasant thing, Lily. Shall I charm it away? Don't you remember at Dresden how the headache went,\" and as he spoke he began to make a few mesmeric passes. \" But it won't now,\" she said, catching his hands, and stopping him. \" Do let me alone,\" she added pettishly, \" you are in such high spirits \u2014 so different from anything I ever saw before ; and I am only like a killjoy. You both wish me away or dead ; and oh ! so do I ! \" \" Lily, Lily ! \" he said, sternly."], [194, "186 UPS AND DOWNS. .s \" It is true ! I wish I was dead \u2014 I wish I was ! \" He suddenly let go her hand, which he had kept in his, whistled a little, and walked away. Lily cried bitterly. Now he was gone, she would fain have brought him back. She glanced penitently towards him, but he did not look round. Then he left the room, and her sobs broke out with double violence. He looked in again for a moment. All his late brightness had entirely vanished. He w*as again the cold, grave man ; and a chill crept over Ellen, while she felt very angry with Lily for her perversity, so peculiarly trying to his nature, and so very impolitic under the existing circumstances. \"Lily,\" he said, coining towards her, \"this is absurd and wrong. You will be ill. If you don't wish to utterly disgust me\u2014 to drive me away,\" he added, in a low but emphatic tone, \" you will try to exercise a little self-control. How can you suppose I can bear this over and over again ? I am sick of it \u2014 very nearly. Come! w*ill you order up some wine and water,\" he added, seeing her stop crying a little, and stroking her hair, the one and only way he had of showing affection. She caught his hand quickly, and covered it with kisses. \" Come, be a good child,\" he said, soothingly ; and then he rang the bell, and ordered the tray to be brought. But Lily could not keep up ; and, after vainly trying to swallow the wine he offered her, she left them. As soon as she could do so, Ellen also rose to go too. But he entreated her not to go so soon \u2014 open-"], [195, "187 PLAYING WITH EDGED TOOLS. ing the window, and pointing to the young moon, he drew her own chair where she could see it. It seemed cruel to go, when he was so evidently wanting comfort and asked her so particularly to remain. Yet ought she to stay ? She could not forget their walk to the rock, and the tones of his voice still rang in her ears, and while it caused a confused joy, warned her to beware. After some evident doubt and hesitation, she again moved to go. He sighed, but said nothing to detain her. She spent several minutes afterwards in decid ing whether she had acted well or ill. \u2014 Ah! that constant doubting and fearing ! Why did she not ask a better guidance than her own judgment ?"], [196, "188 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER XIV. HUSBAND AND WIFE. There was unusual stillness in the air. Not a leaf stirred, and the waves seemed to creep over the sands in a stealthy, slow way, while a dark, lurid light on the water made the deep blackness of the clouds more conspicuous. Suddenly a whistling wind rushed by, but it was quickly gone, and again came that threat ening stillness. It was oppressive to breathe. Only the flies seemed to go on their way as usual, and they buzzed and pitched everywhere, blackening the small lodging-house windows. As the morning advanced, people fancied they heard low and very distant rumbling of thunder ; and then again came the wind, this time sweeping up the long street and before the terrace, with a louder rush, and sending aloft clouds of sand and dust. The gulls flapped their large wings, and one here and there uttered a shrill cry while swooping down over the rising breakers. Granville Mortimer was apparently watching the rising of this storm, while he waited for his wife to come to a late breakfast. Presently she appeared, and"], [197, "HUSBAND AND WIPE. 189 as it is an undisputed fact that some persons are more susceptible of atmospheric influences than others, and that a thunder -storm will often unhinge the whole system, it might be supposed that it was this which jarred on poor Lily's nerves this morning, causing her to be tearful and captious. Conversation was a failure for that hour, though Granville did his best to keep it up. His wife was contradictory and Ellen grave. Little Edward was confined to his bed with a feverish cold. Lily adverted to this often, and in sisted that he was very ill. Her husband thought less of it, and assured her that it only required common care and nursing. \" Mayn't I send for the doctor ? \" she asked at last, in an injured tone. \" No ; there is no reason at all for such an expense,\" he answered, rather shortly. \" No reason ! Just go and look at him. Poor child ! \u2014 poor boy ! It is plain you care little for him : of course, he is my child \u2014 and everyone is forgotten now, but\u2014 but \" She was going on in a quick jerking way, hardly aw*are what she said, when he stopped her, holding up his hand, his eyes glistening, and his lips pale : \" Stop there!\" He spoke sternly. \"You have said quite enough. You had better go and nurse your child if he is so very ill.\" \" My child ! And isn't he yours, too ? But it is shocking to see \u2014 dreadful to know \" Again the uplifted hand and eye checked her. He came quite close to her, his tall figure seemed to shiver"], [198, "190 UPS AND DOWNS. under the strong control he put on himself as he whispered, \" Are you quite mad ? \" It awed her. She sank back in her chair, and began to cry. He went to the window, and looked out. \" After all, I do believe the storm will pass over us. I prophesy a fine day,\" he said. \" We might go to the Cove, taking our books. What do you say ? \" turning to Ellen. \" It would be pleasant.\" \" Then I will go at once and make arrangements. I suppose you -will hardly come,\" he added, looking at Ms wife. \"You won't like leaving Edward to Anne, I suppose ? \" \"Not come! But I will come!\" she exclaimed, starting up vehemently, and her eyes quite flashing fire. \"It is downright wicked! You -set me to watch the child while you two go off together. It is shameful ! I won't bear it ! \" She stopped, gasping for breath. He was standing opposite her, and as she spoke Ms whole bearing had become actually rigid. It was the fearful passion of a man w*ho usually keeps a strong curb on his temper, hard to provoke, but when once roused mighty and frightful in its intensity. His lips moved, but no sound came, till, after an ominous pause, he said, \" Leave the room !\" in a hissing tone. Drops stood on his forehead ; his face was quite colourless. \" Leave the room ! \" he repeated more quietly, yet louder. She tossed up her arms, and gave a low, piteous cry, as if she had received a wound. Then, burying her face in both hands, while her long curls"], [199, "HUSBAND AND WIFE. 191 fell out of place and covered her face, she sobbed bitterly, yet she did not move. Suddenly she looked up and pushed back her hair, setting her lips tightly together, and planting her foot, as if taking firmer hold. Then she folded her arms, sometliing in the way he was in the habit of doing. \" No, I won't leave the room ! Do you think I will go and leave you to mock me, while you make love to her ? You are both of you very wicked. I am your wife. You can't deny that. Can you ? \u2014 Can you, I say ? \" \" No, I cannot,\" he answered bitterly, and for the first time moving a step backwards. \"No, w*e are both bound by iron fetters \u2014 you and I. You must obey me. It is useless to kick against it, Lily ! Hear me!\" he added, holding up his hand with a gesture full of command, while his voice resumed more of its wonted tone. \" You know if all this time I have fulfilled my duty to you, or not. It rests with your self whether you and I part now at once and for ever \u2014 or \" \" You don't mean it ! You can't mean that ! \" she exclaimed, in a shrill, broken tone, changing her defiant manner to one of the most piteous entreaty; grasping his arm with both her hands, and looking wildly up in his face. \" You won't leave me, surely ! You can't ! \u2014 after all my love ! \" \" Your love ! \" he repeated, bitterly, and shaking her off. \" What was your love ? Do you call it love to destroy a man's happiness ? I wonder at your having the face to talk of love, when it was nothing but the"], [200, "192 UPS AND DOWNS. most selfish passion. You have been my ruin, body and soul, and you talk of your love ! Woman ! haven't you outraged every feeling ? Didn't you withhold what you knew I was well nigh dying for ? \u2014 wickedly, basely, kept back what might have \" but here, instead of a word, only came a gasping sigh. He stopped short. Lily had rushed from him, and was now kneeling before the couch, trembling with her passionate feelings. He caught hold of the back of a chair, as if to steady himself; and having recovered breath he went on pour ing out a torrent of burning words, reckless who heard them. Every barrier was broken down, and the deep and hitherto confined stream now rushed headlong on its way, regardless of obstacles, foaming and lashing itself into greater fury, as it went on. \" For God's sake recollect yourself, Granville ! \" Ellen ventured to say. \" As to you, Ellen,\" \u2014 he turned to her \u2014 \" I see your attempts to check me. But it is vain. I will for once speak out. And when I blame her, as I do from my very soul, as having injured me irrevocably, and deceived me basely, neither do I exonerate you. You look surprised! But I say now, why did you act a part ? Why did you always suppress the truth, and let me see you in a false light? I am not alluding to those miserable reports and suspicions\u2014indepen dently of all that, you had not the courage to do justice to your own heart. You misled me cruelly.\" \" I don't see the use of this recrimination,\" Ellen said, gently. \" Perhaps I, too, may have my wrono-s"], [201, "HUSBAND AND WIFE. 193 to complain of. But, as I say, what is all this to lead to now? We have all erred, and must suffer.\" \" Do you suffer, then ? Say that again. Is there suffering in it \u2014 to you ? \" \"You seem glad to think so.\" \" I am ! My God, isn't it natural to be glad ! You do suffer, then ? Suffer regret ? \" Lily here rose slowly from her knees, and pale and crushed she leaned against the chimney-piece, looking at them, but evidently thoroughly exhausted. \" Do you, man and wife \u2014 yes, man and wife,\" Ellen said earnestly, \" try to understand one another. Be friends as you were before \u2014 before I ever came to mar all. Let me only see you content before I leave.\" \" Leave ! \" He caught up the word \"leave.\" \" Come,\" he threw in a slightly sarcastic tone, mingled with an attempt at coolness, which every now and then, how ever, broke into passion, \"now we have had some talk, and we are perhaps all three more aware of the true ground we stand on. The prospect is not very bright, but let us make the best of it. I am married ; I acknowledge the bond. But it is also true I was mar ried under deception. In all other cases, such a bond would be void. I won't here discuss the wisdom of binding two unwilling souls in this hopeless way. But, Lily, I speak to you \u2014 attend! You say you loved me !

Now I must leave you.\" Ellen, feeling the positive necessity for rest, and seeing that Lily was disposed to talk still, she left her. But, as she went up-stairs, such a host of thoughts, new and bewildering, came before her, she felt she dared not trust herself to them. She did not wish to think just then \u2014 above all, to recall the scene of the last hour ; so, remembering the sick child, she turned towards his nursery, glad of the idea of any active employment to escape from self introspection. She opened the door very gently, and then knew the child was not alone. She knew the voice she heard singing some funny little song, and would have immediately gone back, but the song ceased, and Granville said, \" Come in, Ellen.\" He must have known her step. She said something not very clear, about commg to"], [205, "HUSBAND AND WIFE. 197 enqmre, and leaving Lily alone. She felt shy, and her face was flushed painfully. \"Don't go!\" the child cried out. \" Stay with me a little bit ! \" So she went in, and stood for a moment at the foot of the httle bed. The father was sitting at the head with his arms round his boy, and his other hand playing fondly among the thick and glossy curls. He looked calm and thoughtful, but not unhappy, though even then traces might be seen of the late storm which had so transformed his countenance. Purple lines were round the eyes ; he was unusually pale ; and even his very hair seemed to fall back with a heavier sweep, as if his brow was too hot to bear it. It would almost seem as if the work of years had been done in that short but terrible strife. \" You are come to see Ned, the sick man ? \" \" Yes ; can't I reheve you ? Don't you wish to go out?\" \" Hark ! there's the thunder at last. Well, no thank you : it seems scarcely walking weather. By the way, where is Lily ? She is such a coward about thunder alw*ays.\" \" I left her below, hoping she might sleep. If you hke to go to her, I can stay here.\" \" No, no, papa, stay : both stay ! \" pleaded the child, peering up from his coverings. Granville withdrew his arm, and placed a chair, not far from his own. \" Sit down. You have no objection, have you ? \""], [206, "198 UPS AND DOWNS. \" Oh, no, certainly not,\" she answered, quickly, and feeling herself blushing yet more under Ms look. \"That's right,\" he said, softly. \"You must not shun me.\" \" I don't shun you,\" she answered, wisMng to prevent any return to agitating topics, and striving to sit very much at her ease. \" Do not,\" he said, just taking her hand for a moment, hut letting it go again. \" There is no wrong in my heart ; trust me ! Here by the side of my child \u2014 that child who brought you back to me \u2014 to us \u2014 I solemnly ask you to trust me. What is the world to us, even should it presume to judge?\" \" What is she crymg for, papa ? \" said Edward, look ing up curiously. To divert his attention, his father began another song; but before it was ended, there came a fearful peal of thunder, just above their heads, while the lightning seemed to stream quite mto the room. A shrill scream resounded through the house, at the same moment bringmg them both to their feet. \" Lily ! \" Granville said, and he hastened down-stairs, while Ellen, alarmed, follow*ed Mm to the door to listen. Lily was nearly beside herself with fright. She had just fallen into a doze, when the crash awoke her. Seeing her husband, she threw herself into Ms arms, entreating him not to leave her. \" I thought you were gone \u2014 gone entirely ! \" she said. \" Foolish child ! \" and he carried her back to the sofa ; but before she was there she had fainted. The"], [207, "HUSBAND AND WIFE. 199 fit lasted so long as to alarm him; and hardly had she recovered at all, when another came. A medical man was sent for, and he spoke of some shock to the nervous system. It was sad to see her lie so death like, as she did for the remainder of that day. The thunder rolled loud and deep, and at last only subsided in a frightful storm of hail, and then rain and wind. There was strife without ; within there was the awful quiet of suspense, for Lily was seriously ill : her husband watched and tended her with fostering care ; it seemed as if he could not do enough. He sat that evening for hours, as she liked, with her hand in his, her head on his breast. Painful as the position must have been, he gave no sign of a desire to move. Ellen went to and fro from the mother's sick room to the child. Though still obliged to guard her injured arm, she was of great use, and felt all her natural energy revive under the pressure of the call. TMs was the beginning of a serious and even danger ous illness ; and Ellen, feeling herself of real use in taking care of the child (though, from her presence exciting Lily, she was not allowed to be in the sick room), wrote to explain why her visit was still prolonged. Bessie took it as a very natural and proper arrange ment, so that there was no external difficulty, no hindrance to her mdulging her inclination and fancy to the full. Granville made an attentive and zealous nurse \u2014 the fondest husband could do no more. It brought out his good points, and caused Ellen's heart to rejoice, while there was the exquisite subtle grati-"], [208, "200 UPS AND DOWNS. fication of knowing how pleasant it was for him, during his intervals of rest, to find her in the drawing-room, ready with comfort and care. He pleasantly and frankly expressed his satisfaction, that he always found a ready s}-mpathy in the ups and downs of the ilhiess. It was not necessary for him to put it into words; she understood that his wife's recovery was anxiously hoped for. The little intercourse they had durhig this time, necessarily intimate as it w*as, drawing them together through household channels, as they had never been before, was singularly free from all allusion to forbidden subjects. Neither by look nor word did he touch on all the previous agitation, or their former intimacy and estrangement. Ellen was content and happy. For a time no fear, no whisper from within or hmt from without, rippled the smoothness, the peace which surrounded her. Nor did her happiness prevent her from sincerely feeling for Lily, or render her out of harmony, as it were, with the spirit of the hour. But every trifling circumstance was touched with magic ; her heart and mind were lifted up ; and though she was unaware, she was under a spell. The enchanter had touched her eyes, and she saw* only a fair and smooth path, where in reality lurked danger and sin."], [209, "201 CHAPTER XV. THE TURN OF THE SCALE. Ellen was musing over a letter which she held open. Lily, now convalescent, was reclining on the sofa, look ing strikingly pretty and youthful in her invalid dress, and the half cap of soft lace, that she wore to hide the loss of her hair, which had been cut off in her ill ness. The letter was from Bessie. After some ram bling domestic details, principally relating to the children and the servants, she said : \u2014 \". . . . We are all longing for your return, in- cluding our constant visitor Mr. Vaughan, of whom, by the way, I shouldn't at all wonder if we soon had some news to tell you. He is so often at the Vicarage. Though he tries to be grave when I pour out my grum blmg to him about your absence, and poor Granville's unsuitable marriage, he can't help looking joyful and happy, which does a little provoke me ! I own I vex at it ! I do like him so very, very much ; and I am so sure he liked you ! AVhat a pity it is ! \"As to all you say of Granville and his wife \u2014 of course I can never forget all his affection for me. But I am not surprised at the tone of his sister's letter about"], [210, "202 UPS AND DOWNS. it. They must feel hurt at the connection, and, how ever pretty she may be, I am sure I always fancied that he would require so much more in a wife. Of course I shall do all I can to receive her properly. But I am greatly disappointed in him.\" \"I don't like that cough,\" Ellen remarked aloud, presently. \"The doctor says that coughs and colds are very general,\" remarked Lily. And then Ellen folded up the letter, and put it away. Was there anything else in it besides Bessie's cough to trouble her ? Apparently not, to judge from her face. Yet, as might be expected, since Lily's recovery, some of that temper which had been subdued by the greater pressure of severe illness, had returned. It often marred the smoothness of their life, and although sometimes it caused vexation and trouble, it bore rather on daily life than on their peculiar circumstances. Lily always urged Ellen's remaining, even more than her husband did ; and if she did not like it, she had at least learned to control herself outwardly at seeing them together. Ellen seemed content to assume that all was right ; and there was too much of fascination for her to wish to lift the veil and look face to face at truth. Stronger minds than hers might have found it hard to resist the subtle flattery of feeling how her presence increasingly gladdened his life, and even seemed to bring out all his good points. She never came into the room when he was there without that welcome, not spoken certainly, which of all other things makes life t"], [211, "THE TUPN OF THE SCALE. 203 sweet. It needed no words to know, that for her he spoke eloquently and dropped his habitual reserve ; for her, music again became an interest, and he sang his very best ; and more than all, for her sake, he strove to please his wife. Once he said to her, when she spoke hesitatingly of leaving \u2014 \" If you do \u2014 if you give me up \u2014 what is to become of us ? With you beside me, duty is easy. With your sympathy and your friendsMp, I can fulfil my part to her \u2014 even make her happy. Ellen ! for God's sake don't desert me ! Think of the accident, the mere accident which has separated us two. Yes \u2014 let me speak this once. Then say if our case is to be ruled and judged by common measurement ? What harm is there ? Don't I make a far better husband and father now, than I could do apart from you ? And who do you wrong ? For I cherish that pleasant notion, that you, happier in tMs than I am, are free, quite free. \" As to the impossibility you speak of \u2014 of your living on here \u2014 let it pass for the present.

If you knew \u2014 could guess \u2014 the shuddering it gives me, to think of any sort of move or change ! Now, I live, breathe : now, Ellen, I can dare to look onwards, to believe in God and Heaven \" What did she say? What could she say to such words? While the very cadence of the voice, the very nearness of his presence, was thrilling pleasure !"], [212, "204 UPS AND DOWNS. Her heart throbbed too much to speak. She answered nothing. But \u2014 she remained. It had become a constant thing, since Lily's illness had perforce kept her at home, for the two, Granville and Ellen, to walk together. Sometimes they took the child, sometimes not. It happened that in their last walk they bad been tempted to forget time : an interesting subject beguiled them to out-stay their usual hour of return. The fading light at last reminded them, and Ellen rose hurriedly from her seat on the rock, observing that Lily would be waiting tea. The evening was peculiarly soft and delicious : the lights on sea and sky delicate and dreamy, and the waves whispered a fit accompaniment to the scene. Behmd, on the hills, hung a nearly full moon. It was an hour to inspire a poet or an artist \u2014 an hour to touch some inner chord in every human heart. No impressionable person could avoid its influence in some degree. Ellen drew a long, low sigh as she looked round, and said lightly, \" It was a pit}- to go in and leave it.\" He said nothing, but as she placed her hand on his arm to walk homewards, it was certainly pressed gently to his side. They turned from the sea, and she stole a glance at his face: whatever it was she saw there, it caused her to tremble and change colour. Yet they walked on calmly ; and nothing was said. They were in a narrow lane, which led from the beach to the terrace on which stood their house. Here it was almost dark, and it was rough and stony. Ellen was trying to think of some-"], [213, "THE TURN OF THE SCALE. 205 thing to say, feeling the silence awkward, for suddenly her happiness had been too much flushed with con sciousness to be quite easy. \" Jacob had Rachel at last, though at first he was put off with Leah,\" Granville startled her by saying in a low voice. Silence fell again, for of course she had no answer for that. Presently he went on, as if she knew the hne his thoughts had taken. \"You don't know \u2014 you never can imagine, what a hard and unbelieving cynic I was fast becoming ! My poor little boy's narrow* escape was, I believe, my salva tion \u2014 it restored to me my Rachel ! Don't tremble, Ellen ! I mean no harm, but I can't resist the impulse to tell you \u2014 to try to tell you \u2014 what you are to me \u2014 what you have done for me : I am not even in thought transgress ing, or breaking the ground of that trust I asked of you.

We should do well to refer ourselves more entirely to His judgment than we do, instead of start ing aside at every shadow raised by worldly customs, fettering ourselves with low and mean prejudices.

A rough, and perhaps providential mterruption dispersed all further confidence. They were abruptly accosted by a man, who, hat in hand, demanded if it was Mr. Mortimer he saw ? \u2014 It proved to be a messenger sent by Lily, whom they found thoroughly upset with nervous fright at their late return. Ellen's cheeks burned as she tried to"], [215, "THE TURN OF THE SCALE. 207 explain their forgetfulness of the hour. Her hands shook so, that she could hardly light her candle. A firm hand took it from her; and, looking up, she met his eye, at once earnest, tender, and admonitory. There w*as no mistaking the writing on his face: never had she seen it more full of ardent but suppressed joy. She turned away, fearmg to see more, and left him vainly attempting to soothe Ms wife. The next day, for hours, she had remained in a trance of memory, in toxicated by the remembrance of that walk. Yet it had upset her previous seeming content. Already the specious veil of enchantment was drawn aside. All day she had almost dreaded seeing him. All day she had been very silent, though making great efforts at intervals, when Lily observed her, to be as usual. When he came into the room to propose a walk, laughingly assuring Lily they would be in excellent time, Ellen hesitated, and at last said she had rather not walk at all. She w*as tired \u2014 she had letters to write : in fact, she did not wish to go. He did not press it ; but, after looking keenly from his wife to her, he left the room to go alone. \"Why didn't you go with him?\" Lily presently asked, in a short, abrupt way. \" I had rather not \u2014 I thought it would be a good time for him to take that very long walk he has spoken of.\" \" You know he would rather have you than any long w*alk !

But don't, don't let him think I said anything to you! You know I haven't said one word! Havel?\" \" No, not a syllable. It is not that.\" \" Oh ! my God ! would it was over ! would I had died!\" Lily ejaculated presently, after a pause. \" Lily ! don't say such frightful, such presumptuous things. You ought to be thankful.\" \" Thankful ! I ? for what ? \u2014 Don't preach to me ! I don't think so much of you as I did. I don't ! \" Here her sobs became convulsive. \"I used to think you everything that is good. I don't now ! And oh ! \" \u2014 here her voice became broken and sad \u2014 \"that's the worst of it all. Yes, the very worst ! I don't now respect him. I can't think him good \u2014 so very good now ! \" \" How dare you say so, Lily ? So very good and kind as he is to you and to \u2014 to every one.

He is kind, I know that. But hi his heart he hates me.\" \" How can you say so, when you know how he tries to please you?\" \" Yes, at your suggestion, just to please you !

III. P"], [218, "210 UPS AND DOWNS. \" Lily, don't ! Spare me this ! God help me ! \" Lily suddenly checked herself \u2014 struck, apparently, with Ellen's deep distress. She was also alarmed at her indiscretion ; and, in spite of her own assertions, dreaded any such outbreak on her part reaching him. She began to excuse herself, and asked pardon, begging Ellen not to show anything of her agitation to Gran ville. It was long before Ellen spoke, or seemed to notice anything she said. At last she raised her head, and showed Lily a face fixed in some purpose, but unutterably miserable ! It was flushed, or streaked, with hectic lines, rather than pale. Her eyes were dilated, yet drooping. The very carriage of her head was altered : there was shame, yet with it an air of determination.\" \"Lily \u2014 try to be patient and gentle, will you? \u2014 to him, I mean.

But why do you ask ? \" \" Nothing. I was thinking of our plans.\" She returned to the table to take up her work-basket and a few stray books, and then slowdy and lingeringly she left the room, passed more rapidly up the stairs, shut her door and locked it \u2014 and then, throwing herself on her knees, she cried to God to help her, to save her! ' It had come at last. The veil was drawn aside, and before her, in all its horror and exceeding blackness, was the gulf of Sin. Yet, even then, even there, soft, insidious voices were whispering in her ear, reiterating all the reasoning, all the sophistry, deafening all other sound, blinding her eyes, confusing her sense of right and wrong. It was struggling in deep waters \u2014 like plunging suddenly into some lovely stream she had before admired, and finding its pure sweet waters were to be her death. And where was the shore ? Where the arm to cling to ? Had it come to this? Was this the end of all the striving of later years ? \u2014 of all Mrs. Legard's teaching p 2"], [220, "212 UPS AND DOWNS. and prophecy ?

Now all the pleasantness had turned to mere delirium\u2014 the mask was rudely torn away, and a sin too horrible for her lips to name was there plain before her. And it was this thing she had clasped to her heart, and cherished under the guise of friendship ! By degrees, mere physical exhaustion served to disperse some of the phantoms, to hush some of the multitude of voices, and then one idea became clearer and clearer. It grew more and more distinct, till finally it took shape, and even sound, for although alone she spoke. \" I must go at once. I may not see him again.\" This she repeated many times. It stilled the tempest ; it gave her fresh strength and power. She arose, and looked about her dizzily, like one stunned at first. Presently she began to open her draw*ers, and remove their contents mto a box which stood at hand. She rolled up ribbons, and gathered together papers and letters; spread out her dresses with that ready and neat precision which in some women never fails, even under the most bewilder ing circumstances. Once, in the midst of her work, she paused, and suddenly covered her eyes with one hand, w*hile a tremor passed over her whole frame. It was but a moment, and it passed with a heavy sigh, while tears for the first time rolled over her face. It is an awful thought; yet who knows but that every trial of a man's past life \u2014 every circumstance"], [221, "THE TURN OF THE SCALE. 213 has only been a preparation for the strife and conflict of one moment \u2014 one short moment of time : involving the final leaning of the balance either one way or the other \u2014 right or wrong !

Ellen staggered, for even as she uttered the words again, \" I must go,\" a step sounded on the stairs \u2014 a step that had \" music in it \" to her ear. She sank into a chair, heard it slightly, almost imperceptibly, pause at her door, and then go on up other stairs, and a door shut sharply. \" God help me ! \" she cried. It was some time before he came down again. Not till tea time. Ellen had remained listening for the sound before she could go on with her work. Now, she knew she should be summoned, and she must make some excuse. What would he say \u2014 what think ? Lily would have to make and pour out tea. Would her face betray anything ? If so, how would he look ? What would he say ? She sat, trembling very much, listening at every sound, dreading what she might hear; almost repenting of her resolve to remain up stairs that evening. Would it not be better to go down just as usual ? Wasn't it unwise to give any cause for alarm ? \u2014 to let Lily stand the brunt of his"], [222, "214 UPS AND DOWNS. displeasure, upset as she already had been that even ing? The senant came to say that the urn w*as carried in and that missis said, \" Wouldn't Miss Ray mond please to come down ? \" \" I have a headache,\" she said, hurriedly ; \" I can't come down. Will you say so? If you will bring me a cup of tea here, I shall thank you.\" \"Master hopes you'll be better after drinking tMs, and bids me say it is very pleasant in the verandah,\" was the next message. She tried to go on with her packing, but she found she must listen. Voices could be heard in her room from the drawing-room. They lingered long over the tea in the dining-room apparently, for all was still. A quick opening and shutting of doors made her heart beat. She hardly knew what she dreaded. But soon the little boy's voice was heard, \" Papa, mayn't I come down ? \" Then there w*as a long, striding step? clearing two stairs at once, and a glad scream of joy, and much kissing. \" He has his child. That is such a blessing ! \" she thought, and tears again came. o * o They w*ere in the verandah. She heard their voices now plainly \u2014 even the words. Lily was speaking \u2014 not fretfully, but as if pleased. Father, mother, and child, they seemed happy \u2014 they were not missing her, even ! Soon the notes of a plaintive air, whistled clearly and softly as a flute, reached her. The whistling turned to singing. It was an \" Addio,\" mournful rather than impassioned, with here and there a tone of"], [223, "215 THE TURN OF THE SCALE. sweetest soothing, biddiug the beloved one not to weep, for that they should meet again. It had been an old favourite. Years ago they had sung it together, he improvising a second. Of late he had, at her request, sung it frequently, sometimes in the boat, sometimes with a simple but beautiful accom paniment. It spoke of sorrow, but of hope \u2014 of meet ing again ! For her there must be no meeting again. She had taken her last look ! This was the last time she might ever hear him. Was he unsuspecting \u2014 un conscious ? \u2014 or w*as there some sympathy even now in his heart \u2014 some vague prevision of fresh sorrow, which gave that thrilling tone to the words \u2014 \" Addio ? \" She wept long, long after the sounds had ceased, and they had retired to the drawing-room. But it did her good. And now she determined to finish what must be done quickly, and then try to rest. She should need all her strength, and all her power of self-control, for what she had to do on the morrow. When the servant came to see what more she could do for her, and to say good-night, she left a small three cornered note, saying, master bade her give it, and to say that she must please not be alarmed at hearing a noise very early in the morning, as he w*as going away at six. The note said \u2014 \" What can have made you ill so very suddenly ? I fear you are really suffering, or you would have- spent this evening below, knowing that I am to be absent for"], [224, "216 UPS AND DOWNS. two or three days. Be well when I return, which I need hardly say will be as soon as possible. I go with an unwilling mind. Induce Lily to go out a little ; I didn't quite like her looks this evening. \" God bless you. G. M.\" In vain did Ellen seek sleep, and yet she could scarcely be said to be entirely awake. Then it was that her strength was tried. It seemed as if a host of spirits were allowed, each in his own manner, to prove her resolution. A series of pictures opened before her, one after another ; she seemed to be look ing into those magical mirrors hi which the future is shown. And as each scene vanished to make way for another, she heard his voice : \u2014 \" And to this you condemn me ! Fear of words, and selfish care of yourself, bring me to this.\" Scenes too horrible for description they were. Always one tale \u2014 one thing: his ruin, body and soul ! At last she started up with a half-scream. \" This is too horrible ! Am I asleep, and dreaming ? What is it ? No, no ! I won't go ; I will never desert him ! Come what will to me, say what they like, I can bear it ! What is there a woman can't bear for those she loves ? I will never be the cause of his ruin ! \" Then she struck a light, and drank some water. She opened the window : there was the moon, clear and cold, and there were other planets, and a few soft white clouds, moving slowly across the deep gray sky ; all"], [225, "217 THE TURN OF THE SCALE. was peace. The clear, rather harsh tone of the town clock sounded three. There was the distant bark of a dog, and the hideous wail of some cat. These common sounds reassured her, and perhaps the fresh night air, which cooled her hot temples, also helped to dispel the dreadful visions of darkness. \" No, it will not be so. He won't do so ! He is too good. It will shake him \u2014 try him, perhaps, but it is best for him as for me ; he will surely see it so ! I have gone astray like a lost sheep \u2014 sadly astray. No wonder if horrors beset my path ! How could I ? \" and she shuddered again, looking at the life she had led lately. It was like seeing a stage, lately lit up, and showing scenes of enchantment and exquisite beauty, now, in the clear light of day, ghastly, grim, and foul. \" If God is true, if heaven is true, if sin is a true and a real thing, and if this be sin \u2014 now let me see it and feel it to be so, as he also will see and feel it. Oh, those dreadful whispers ! The same voice that sounded to our Lord himself in the wilder ness \u2014 to Eve, and to Job.\" At last she prayed. Then she was soothed and refreshed, and lost the dreadful nightmare sensation. She tried once more to rest, and succeeded, even falling asleep so soundly that she only awoke at hearing the front door close with its usual squeaking and grating noise. She sprang up wildly, and rushed to the window, clearly awake at once to reality, and to the work of the new day. A fly stood in the street, but she was too late; she only caught a glimpse of"], [226, "218 UTS AND DOWNS. a hand, as it rested for a moment on the window-ledge. It was withdrawn; in a moment the carriage was out of sight. She had so longed for one more look, unknown to him, that it seemed like some fresh grief. There was now no time to be lost. She dressed, and completed her packing; putting a few things into a hand bag, she locked her trunk, which she intended to send for. Her own maid had long since been sent home ; she would have been glad of her now. When the servant brought the usual early cup of coffee, she remarked, \" Master said he should return the day after to-morrow, miss, and he hoped you and the missis would please to meet him at the Cross Road at six.\" \" How is your mistress ? \" \" She has a headache, and don't wish to be dis turbed till such time as she rmgs.\" This was well. There was nothing unusual in her taking an early walk alone ; so she went out now. She was tempted to visit the rock, that favourite seat, where she had seen little Edward's accident \u2014 where they had sat on that last evening. But no ! There must be no looking back \u2014 no dallying and trifling now. So she walked straight to the inn and ordered a fly. In ten minutes she was off, and in an hour she was seated in a four-horse coach, which took her within eight miles of home. While changing horses, she wrote to Lily. It was an eventful journey, but she was utterly weary when she reached the low gate leading into Cliff Cottage. She was of course not"], [227, "THE TURN OF THE SCALE. 219 expected, and Anne rubbed her eyes, and wondered and smiled, and deplored that Mrs. Mortimer and the young ladies were out. \" Gone to the vicarage for a couple of days, hoping the change would do Mrs. Mortimer's cough good. Yes,\" she added, on being further questioned, \"the cough had been very troublesome, but Mrs. Mortimer had no thought of Miss Raymond's coming home.\" Ellen was hardly sorry to be quite alone, and not required to exert herself. She might now give way to the feeling of stupor and dulness which oppressed her. She might face her lowliness and desolation, and need wear no mask ; it was a welcome respite. When she looked mechanically at the glass before going to bed, she rather wondered to find that she looked pretty much the same as usual. She had an undefined idea that there would be some mark on her \u2014 some great change. But though pale, and somewhat dull and drawn, there was her own face, and she sighed as she reckoned up the probable years she might yet have to live, wondering how it would be, and thinking it an infinitely dreary prospect The very familiar sounds of birds and beasts, the rustle of the breeze in the leaves, the rush of the waves, wearied and annoyed her. She was tired, she said, seeing her maid's eyes curiously fixed on her \u2014 very tired: she would go to bed at once, and shut out both light and sound."], [228, "220 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER XVI. MAKING A MATCH. Perhaps it was a fortunate thing for Ellen that her sister chanced to be absent Those two quiet days in the old place did her good. After the hour for the post had gone by, there was no more watching or suspense ; her time passed on like a dream. She did nothing, and everything seemed strange, even to the bringing in and eating her meals. Sometimes a period of great agitation is followed by a sensation of numb ness ; it is Nature's kindly provision. Ellen did not feel keenly during this time. She shed no tears ; she did not think it was dull. She walked about, visiting her old haunts, and surprised herself by sleeping much and heavily. Probably this saved her from illness : her state struck the servant-girl as strange, being so unlike what she had ever before been. She believed that it was all owing to the loneliness \u2014 the disappointment at finding the \" folks away : it was so whisht ! \" And contrary to Ellen's express orders, she contrived that a report of her arrival should reach the vicarage. Accordingly, at the end of the second day, there was a sound of footsteps on the gravel, and many voices,"], [229, "MAKING A MATCH. 221 joyful exclamations and kisses. In fact, a truly hearty and loving welcome. When the children were in bed, once again the two sisters surveyed each other. \" I am glad to see you looking so well ! \" was Bessie's remark. She had failed to realize the completeness of her sister's recovery by letter reports, and was no great discriminator of countenance at any time. Be sides, Ellen had cheered up under the kindly feeling of sisterhood, of kith and kin. She rejoiced to find that she was comforted ; and yet, in the midst of it all, she paused to wonder that life should so go on \u2014 that such deep misery should have no power to arrest time or custom. Like the wind, it came and it went, no man listeth how ; but leaving marks of its scathing power behind. Meanwhile Ellen's keener power of observation had brought her to a conclusion. \" Oh, Bessie ! why have you not told me that you were so ill ?\" \" 111 ? I said my cough was troublesome, and that is all. I am not ill, dear.\" Ellen shook her head, struck with the wasted appear ance of her face, the stoop of her figure, and the hot and swollen look about the lips. She internally blamed herself for neglect, but said no more, only she threw into her manner a tenderer and more wistful touch, to which Bessie responded more than she had done before. It might be mere fever and excitement; but in spite of evident illness, Ellen thought her less dejected \u2014 more what she was long ago."], [230, "222 UPS AND DOWNS. She was unfeignedly delighted to have Ellen back, and owing to her indignation against Granville for his \" low marriage,\" Ellen was spared many painful questions, which she had prepared herself to hear and answer. \" Nothing can excuse him, Ellen,\" she said once. \" Do you suppose it was a love match ? It can't be a happy marriage surely ? \" \" How few really happy marriages there are, after all ! \" was Ellen's evasive answer. \" That 's true. But it shows he was ashamed, or he wouldn't have kept it secret. I suppose he really did marry her at once, not \" \" Yes \u2014 oh, yes ! They were married very soon aster he made the offer, and sailed for Ostend the same day.\" \" Well, it is very strange ! We used to think, you know, that you and Granville were fond of one another. But that seemed to go off as you grew up. If I re member rightly, you seemed not to take to each other when he returned from abroad.\" Ellen w*as glad to turn the subject, and asked for their neighbours. It seemed that Mr. Vaughan was away, and not expected back yet. That the Edgehills had still their niece with them, and that she was universally admired ; that Mr. Clare was very ill indeed, and not expected to recover ; and that Mrs. and the Miss Clares were much disliked. Then follow*ed questions as to Ellen's success in her painting ; and Bessie, who had forgotten that a broken arm could not draw, was sur-"], [231, "MAKING A MATCH. 223 prised and disappointed at the very little gain of the long visit. \" NotMng hardly. More loss than gain, in fact.\" \" Yes, much more, I fear,\" was the reply. \" And the w*orst is, I can't even draw now,\" Ellen continued ; for a provokmg pahi lingers on in some injured nerve, tMeatening what they call ticdoloreux, and which pre vents my using it long in that position : so, you see, now is your time. If you have ' bundles ' of work, as Lisa says, I am ready, for to sew doesn't hurt, and I can't be idle.\" Nearly a fortnight passed. Ellen's anxieties about Bessie's health were confirmed, and added to this, she craved intensely for news. She had reckoned on one letter, at all events, from Lily, for she had begged her to write. Something bad must surely have prevented it ! To save an hour's suspense, she chose to walk daily to the village post, and so anticipate the slow, hobbling journey of the crippled old woman, who took the few letters from door to door to the more outlying cottages, and was glad so to earn a few pence. Her trunk had arrived a week ago. But it could not speak, interrogate it as she might and did. At last, on the eighteenth day, a letter was handed to her. It was the right writing, but very blotty and illegible. Perhaps Lily was ill ! She read it as she walked homewards, and was surprised to find it was full of the most piteous entreaties for Ellen to return, mingled with incoherent expressions of alarm. If she would only forgive and forget her (Lily's) mad and hard words,"], [232, "224 UPS AND DOWNS. and come back ! Never would she offend her again ! He was gone ! He had left his wife and child, and where he was they did not know. If he was with Ellen, she entreated her to write and say he was well ; and oh! to beg for her, for after all she couldn't live without him. The whole letter w*as incoherent, evi- dently now under the influence of anger and suspi- cion of their combining to deceive her : then falling into the old habit of trusting to Ellen, and believing, if she would but return, all would be right again. The direst fear, the most bitter sorrow, fell upon Ellen after reading it. All her apprehensions, the scenes of which she had dreamt that dreadful night, were perhaps even then realized ! She had deserted him, and he \u2014 oh, Heaven ! what of him ? What might not have happened ? Where was he ? \u2014 The forsaken wife, in her miserable uncertainty, her torturing jealousy and fear, was forgotten. It was his possible fate that tore her very soul to think of. When at last she reached home, it was hardly in her power to give Bessie any explanation. Her lips were glued together. She resolved to go to Lily at once. But when Bessie heard it, she persisted in opposing the plan: Why, she has her husband ! Don't leave me, Nelly ! I shan't trouble you long, perhaps.\" \" Dear Bessie, listen ! Her husband has left her.\" \" Left her ! Granville left his wife ! On a visit, surely ? Of course. Some sudden business, perhaps !"], [233, "MAKING A MATCH. 225 It is only one of his whims. It shows that he doesn't make a friend of her \u2014 doesn't it, though ? But, Ellen ! what is it ? You have not told me all ! What makes you so ghastly ? \" \" Fear \u2014 horrible fear, Bessie ! \" and she clutched .hold of the bannister to save herself from fallmg. \" What ever comes, it is I who have done it ! \" she whispered, excited beyond control, and feeling deadly faint. \" You, Ellen ! and how ? \" \"By coming away suddenly, and without telling him. And yet what could I do ? \" Ellen said piteously. \" Well, that is strange ! Do you mean ? \u2014 Oh, Ellen, what can your leaving be to him ? \u2014 Both brothers ! Both ! \" and she seemed to scan Ellen's face with newly and suddenly awakened understanding, curiosity, and wonder. But it was now like that of a corpse ; and Bessie called loud for the servants, as her own fragile figure could ill prevent her faintmg sister from falling on the stairs. \" Well, she can't go to-day, if she wishes it,\" was Bessie's remark, and Ellen silently acquiesced when, after some moments, she recovered consciousness. For the rest of that day she remamed on her bed. The next day's post brought relief in the shape of a letter. At least the sight of his own handwriting relieved her of a terrible fear she dared not utter. But his writing to her, and what he said \u2014 upbraiding her for breach of contract almost in quitting them, and vehe mently pointing out the necessity for her saving presence \u2014 perplexed her very much ! All the subtle arguments VOL. III. Q"], [234, "226 UPS AND DOWNS. were reiterated, and fresh ones added, to prove that there was not only no risk or shadow of harm, but that it was an act of noble and exalted virtue, for her to devote her life to their happiness as a friend. The selfishness, the egotism, w*hich lay at the bottom, was disguised by the occasional allusion to his devoted love. He wound up his pleading by saying that there was but one motive that could justify her flight for a moment. Was it \u2014 could it be that she feared \u2014 feared herself ? dared not trust to her own powers of control? If so, all would be not only forgiven, for the sake of what such fear implied, but it would be hailed with the deepest gratitude ! Then, with a sudden check, he drew in, professing his in ability to catch at such a blessed idea as that, and ended by urging and entreating her, at present, to keep up a free correspondence with him, as friend to friend, and to promise to visit them again soon. A fresh and fiery trial was thus laid on Ellen. Might she \u2014 dared she answer this letter, and enter into the correspondence he wished for ? Dared she, in fact, refuse? For did he not distinctly warn her that Lily's happiness and peace as his wife hung on Ellen's acceding to or refusing his request. God only can know what the spirit of evil then whispered in her ear, trying to reconcile her, by specious sophistry, to what she most longed to do and desired to believe right. But Ellen had honestly striven to live as one owning another and higher law than her own pleasure or will. Prayers then offered, habits then accepted"], [235, "MAKING A MATCH. 227 and made her own, now gathered round her, and more than all, she was upheld \u2014 her soul was precious in its Master's sight, and above the insidious whisper arose a solemn warning \u2014 \" It is Sin.\" Post aster post came and went, and no letter, no note \u2014 no, not a line, went from her to him ! But the struggle was painful and hard. She could not forget or drown Ms pleading words \u2014 his eager, wistful looks. She feared for him to agony. But she knew that even for him it was the safe way. By her desire, Bessie wrote to Granville. But he returned no answer. Nor did Lily write again, as she hoped. This strain could not but tell on Ellen, and so conscious was she of careworn lines, and fits, wholly uncontrollable, of languor or excitement, that she even rejoiced at Mr. Vaughan's absence from home at this time. She well knew that, though it was all unheeded by Bessie, his keener eye would perceive it, and she shrank from all sympathy or remark. The anxiety and the pain must be met alone. At last it so chanced that she met Mr. Vaughan quite unexpectedly during a morning visit at the Rectory. His first words were as cordial as ever ; he said he was on Ms way to the Cottage; but even while he spoke, something crept, as it were, between them, and stiffened their words and looks. She made a great effort to be \"as usual,\" but it was an effort, and he saw it. Once he looked at her with a sad, questioning surprise, and perceiving this, she talked Q 2"], [236, "228 UPS AND DOWNS. the faster, and with a heightened colour. But it only seemed to chill him, and after a few trifling questions about her return, he left her side, and entered into a playful \" passage of arms,\" as Mrs. Edgehill called it, with Marion Ives. Certainly, she was very pretty, though Ellen thought her very childish manner somewhat affected, and could not, try as she would, very much admire her. \" Now do remain, Mrs. Mortimer ! \" urged the old Rector and his wife. \" Now you are here, you and Ellen must stay ; and Mr. Vaughan, too ! Won't you consent to remain and take a sociable tea ? \" Mr. Vaughan was quite ready to do so. It was a windy autumnal evening. Heaps of dead leaves, bright and even gorgeous in their first decay, lay about the lawn. Marion collected these, and threw* them at Mr. Vaughan. He pelted her in return, and there was a regular race, in which it was hard to say which was the greater child of the four \u2014 for Bessie's little girls were of the party. \" Well, shall we leave those giddy young folks, and get ready for tea ? \" Mrs. Edgehill said, at the same time laying her delicate small hand on Ellen's arm, and leading her to her own dressing-room. Ellen acknowledged to herself, with a sigh, \" Yes, I do feel old, and yet \" But her attention was claimed ; Mrs. Edgehill had something to say : \" What did Mrs. Mortimer\u2014 what did Ellen think ? Was it quite within strict rules of etiquette for Mr."], [237, "MAKING A MATCH. 229 Vaughan to ride alone with little Marion? He was so very kind about it, and it was so nice \u2014 yet \" Bessie thought it perfectly within rule. Mr. Vaughan was not like any one else. \"Ah !\" sighed Mrs. Edgehill. \" What an excellent, pleasing person he is ! Now, I '11 tell you what ! if \u2014 if he were to take a fancy to Marion, there is nothing I should like so much. And, do you know, I do think there is a little liking. I thought so when first she came, while you were absent, dear Ellen. I assure you, he was always coming here. And now, candidly, what do you say ? Do you see anything at all ? \" Ellen had turned away, and luckily Bessie saved her from inventing an answer by saying, \" Really, well I once thought of it ! And now you say so, I do really think there must be something in it.\" For the rest of the evening Ellen found herself watching Mr. Vaughan and Marion. They sat together during tea, and afterwards they looked over the old fashion book, which went back a century and a half. Ellen did her best to listen to Mrs. Edgehill, as, with the inevitable prose of an old person, she descanted on parish matters. This was never a pleasant subject to Ellen : she could not prevent a little resentment when the activity of the Clares was spoken of, choosing to imagine that the praise involved a slur on her own dear friend, who certamly had never been a particularly active lady of the manor. She found the evening very dull, and was ashamed at her restless desire to leave \u2014 leave them all, and"], [238, "230 UPS AND DOWNS. feel herself alone and free to think \u2014 to think of what ? That was a question she neither put nor answered. She roused herself to be more attentive, more con versational, and to say she would be glad to make one of a party which Mr. Vaughan had fixed for Thorn Hall. But though she strove to make it other wise, her manner was stiff and cold, and she saw that he felt it to be so. She was sorry, yet she thought it was partly his own fault. He had been so \u2014 so the right word she could not find. But in fact, his play with Marion displeased her. He seemed to be return ing to what she had first considered him. She forgot for the moment all that was beneath \u2014 all she knew and had proved to be there. And then, with a sudden turn, she blamed herself as capricious and ill-humoured. On their way home, Bessie was rather full of Mrs. Edgehill's idea. She said she saw it very plainly herself, and she should be very glad, for Mr. Vaughan was made to be a married man. \" Glad ! to marry her, \u2014 that child ! \" \" Oh ! she will grow* older, and make a very good wife. But, Ellen, you don't like her. Well, I think you are rather hard: you won't have him yourself, as I wish you would, and you won't let him have any one else.\" \" Indeed, you mistake ! he is quite free to do as he likes. You mistake in every way, for whatever he might have once wished or fancied, he was urged on by Mrs. Wentworth. It was, I believe, more than half her doing : he would not like it now.\""], [239, "MAKING A MATCH. 231 Bessie tried to catch a look at her sister, but not succeeding, she remained silent and musing. Ellen brought her work the next day, in order to sit with her sister, which she made a point of doing every afternoon, though often scarcely one word was exchanged ; almost as she took her seat, there was a sound of steps on the gravel without, and in a moment Mr. Vaughan came in. \" How has the painting prospered of late ? \" he asked soon. \" Oh ! I hardly have done a stroke.\" \"Indeed!\" exclaimed Bessie. \"And I thought you were so very busy ! You are so much in your studio.\" \" I have had no orders,\" said Ellen, with a little colour. \" And as to other drawing \u2014 well, I have not been in the humour, perhaps.\" \" I suppose you don't mean to give it up ? \" said Mr. Vaughan. \" I have to-day brought an ' order ' for you ; one which I think you will like ; for although a likeness, you are at liberty to treat it as you like \u2014 make a fancy picture, if you will.\" \"Who is it?\" \" Guess.\" \" Is it for you ? \" \" Yes ; for me.\" have to go from home again, \" I hope Ellen will not I am sure ? \" said Bessie. \" The sittings will take if she likes,\" he answered. place here in her own studio"], [240, "232 UPS AND DOWNS. \" Then I know \" Ellen began aud stopped. \" Your niece ? \" interrupted Bessie. Mr. Vaughan shook his head, smiling at Ellen. \" Don't you think it a good subject ? \" he said. \" Yes.\" \" How will you treat it? \" \" I leave that to you.\" \" Mrs. Mortimer, what do you say ? It is Marion Ives : how will she look best ? \" \" Ah ! she will make a sweet picture,\" said Bessie. \" How pretty she would look, feeding her pigeons ! \" \" I think she would. What do you say to this, Ellen ? \" \" Oh, of course, whatever is 'ordered' I am bound to do my best to produce.\" She laid an emphasis on the word \" ordered.\" Mr. Vaughan did not notice this, or the evident want of anything like eagerness m her acceptance of the work. He talked on, about the sittings and the time. He explained that it was a secret \u2014 to be kept at present from Dr. and Mrs. Edgehill. He thought the best way was for him to bring Marion here when she rode with him \u2014 if that would suit Ellen. Ellen said, \" Perfectly.\" She had no other work on hand, and was quite at leisure. So it was arranged that the first sitting should be the next day. Soon after which, Mr. Vaughan left. \" A very nice thing, to turn my poor studio into a love-making place !

The first \" sitting \" was a failure. Marion contrived to send the dress she wished to appear in, and changed her habit for it in Bessie's room. But she said she could never sit still and be looked at. She blushed and fidgetted, laughed at everything, and moved, in a w*ay fatal to picture-taking. Ellen seemed to have schooled herself into a resolu tion not to be \" put out.\" No shy and modest artist, a perfect stranger, could sit more gravely or immove ably fixed on her work. When Marion moved, she simply waited, looking grave and biting her lips. As to all the discussion of how she should sit or stand, Ellen said but little. She let them arrange and disarrange, try this and that, with Job-like patience, even making several sketches of different pictures. At last Mr. Vaughan gave a casting vote in favour of one, in which Marion sat, weaving wreaths from a basket of flowers, her head a little bent, show*ing her profile and the outline of a graceful head and throat. This attitude had the advantage of making her sit still, and kept her fingers employed for some time. It was"], [243, "ROCKS AHEAD. 235 quite evident that she enjoyed the whole thing. Mr. Vaughan, too, was as eager and animated as it was his wont to be when interested. He proposed reading aloud. But after a while Ellen stopped it ; she could not bear it, she said \u2014 it distracted her attention, and worried her. The only notice Mr. Vaughan took of this change, which he could not but see in Ellen, was to caution Bessie privately about \" taking care \" of her ; at which Bessie stared, and said \u2014 \" She is very well now, I assure you ; but Ellen is odd, you know \u2014 has peculiar ways, and always had.\" How easy, by the way, it is to dispose of these variations in our fellow*-creatures, by saying such a one is \" odd,\" or has peculiar ways ! The next sitting was fixed, probably, for a week hence. Mr. Vaughan had engagements, he said, mean while, and he remmded all the party of their promise of coming to his house the day after the morrow, when he had promised to introduce a certain new pet he had, but what this pet was, he would not say. There was a sound of wailing in the Cliff Cottage on the morning appointed for the visit to Thorn Park, for during the night one of those storms had arisen which were not unfrequent visitants, and always un welcome, except to Ellen. The little ones looked unhappy, for their mother was grave, and talked of the wisdom of deferring the visit. Meanwhile, the relentless wind went on its way, bringing up masses of cloud, which every now and then emptied themselves"], [244, "236 UPS AND DOWNS. by lashing rain, and then the sun, conquering for a mo ment, glittered on the slanting drops, showing the black ness yet more. Intense, solemn gray everywhere, with sharp, arrowy dashes of light ; the sea rolling, and the waves crossing each other's paths, as if furious to attack some unseen foe. It was a grand scene, but certainly not the day one would choose for driving out in an open carriage. Post-time came ; a little delayed, for the poor, old, crippled messenger had hard work to breast the wind. \" Tell Aunt Ellen there is no letter for her,\" said Bessie, \" or for me.\" \" No letter ! Surely there is \u2014 there must be ! \" But though she searched the bag herself, none appeared. \" Why did not he answer Bessie 's letter, or why did not Lily write ? \" Hastily she left the room, and shut herself into her studio. A close carriage came, for Mr. Vaughan would not let the weather cheat him of his promised guests. And again there was joy and great preparation. \" Where is your aunt ? \" said Bessie, for a wonder ready first, and looking round. \" Please, ma'am, Miss Raymond begs you '11 make her excuses, for she is not very well, and is afraid to come out,\" said the servant. Bessie ran up-stairs, full of kindly pity, as she always was at any complaint of sickness. \" Should she remain ? What could be done for Ellen ? \" But she was told that quiet was the best and the only remedy required ; and, with an anxious, hurried"], [245, "ROCKS AHEAD. 237 kiss, and some little fussy but well-intentioned advice, Bessie consented to go down, for, as Ellen said, it would not do to detain Mr. Vaughan's horses in the rain, which had again burst forth. It was what the villagers called the \"clearer.\" The afternoon was without a drop of rain, but the wind reigned trium phant. It seemed resolved to show all its power \u2014 now rising in fitful gusts, now throwing up the poor fallen leaves, now turning some miserable shrub inside out, then rattling chimneys and doors, and then sweeping onwards, it seemed to pass over the high cliffs, carry ing the spray off, till it reached many a tuft of wild thyme, though apparently snug in some sheltered and distant nook. As for the few thorns and stunted oaks which had managed to live in spite of adversity, they were wrung and twisted till their branches creaked and groaned. Towards evening Ellen ventured forth, with bonnet tied gipsy-fashion, and a cloak heavy enough to resist being turned over her head. She clambered down the cliff steps, and reached a point where she was in some degree protected from the fury of the gale, and where she could see the glory of the sun's setting. It was intensely red and glowing, while the ragged, torn clouds seemed to be gradually form ing around it in heavy, solid masses ; the grandeur and the wildness of the scene arrested attention, and re freshed the fever of her mind. Soon, however, her eyes were withdrawn from sun and wave. She sat with her chin resting on her hand, thinking. \"Had she done right in not even once writing, just to answer"], [246, "238 UPS AND DOWNS. that letter?\" This suspense and utter ignorance, coupled with the fears she could not but have for them both, was most trying. Two or three village lads here came thundering down the cliff, shouting and calling, for they had descried a plank, and were eager to see who would be the one to catch the prize, as it was thrown ashore by a wave. This broke the thread of her thoughts, and again she lifted her eyes to the sky. The sun was gone, a soft light alone remained; while on the opposite side it w*as threatemng and wild still. She remembered the party, and for a moment was imagining herself there, feeling very comfortable to have escaped it, though she did not often, to do her justice, indulge in solitude without work. \" I am growing sour and misanthropical, I fear. I dislike company so very much ! It irks me ! \" These last w*ords were pronounced aloud. And much to her surprise, though she did not start or give any sign of wonder, a voice close by her said, \"Talkmg to yourself! Rather dangerous ! \" In another instant, her hand was taken, encircled and grasped in two strong hands, and she was face to face with Granville Mortimer ! Neither gave the usual greeting. She did not even express any surprise at his presence. He looked at her fixedly. She fancied he was changed, even since she had last seen him. But before she could take in where the change lay, her eyes fell, unable to stand that searching gaze. She tried to withdraw her hand, and with the other nervously pushed aside her ruffled hair."], [247, "ROCKS AHEAD. 239 \" You expected me then ! \" he said, taking a seat close beside her, though somewhat above the rock on which she sat. \" Indeed, no !

There was a strong look of John about him at that very moment as he turned his eyes on her. She missed the lines of stern self-control and pride.

The village boys were gone, not a creature was in sight. The old fishing boat, with its black sides, rocked in the sand, and looked black and grim agamst the white foaming breakers. It was a wild scene. \" Let us go home,\" Ellen said, shuddering, and she tried to rise.

But what is all this?\" As he uttered the last words in a different tone, they both started at seeing some one close behind them, whose approach had been unheard amid the noise and agitation. \" Please, ma'am, I thought \u2014 we were frightened, miss ! Couldn't see you at all ! Old John said, no one wasn't on the beach. So we thought I had best just come and look.

There was no opportunity for more words. Ellen went up-stairs to take off her bonnet, damp with spray. She lingered long, half hoping to hear the carriage return ; dreadmg a further tete-a-tete. Then she rang, and ordered the spare room to be prepared, and length-"], [258, "250 UPS AND DOWNS. ened her stay up-stairs as long as she could. But tea was ready, and she must go down. He was walking to and fro in the little room, to wMch a bright fire, and the tea-things, had given a cheerful, home-like aspect. \" A pleasant contrast to the scene without,\" he remarked, quietly, placmg a chair for her. They took their tea m silence, and she recovered courage to make some common remark, and to look at him. Again she observed that change ! His hair was longer \u2014 there w*as more beard and whisker\u2014 was it that ? No, it lay deeper. There was a change ; and his features were too mobile not to bear the impress. There was greater truth in those terrible words of his than he meant perhaps. There had been strife, and no victory. There had been one whispering in his ear, and he had been hearkened to. \" This is very comfortable. And I am a hungry man,\" he said, lightly. \" How thoughtless of me, not to offer you a meal before ! \" He looked up at this with a meaning gaze. Words were on his lips ; his eyes, too, spoke in a way which brought the colour into her face and made her heart jump and flutter ; but whatever it might be, it was not spoken. For there was at the same moment a sound. The front door opened, and voices, clear, innocent, and eager, filled the passage. \" They are come ! \" she breathed out, as if infinitely relieved and thankful. And in another moment Bessie"], [259, "ROCKS AHEAD. 251 and the children came in. There was of course a start of wonder, which silenced all the news the little girls were so full of. Then Bessie greeted Granville with a sisterly kiss, and repeated her joy and her surprise at finding him there. \" And these are my nieces ? Lisa ! do you quite forget me, that you stand and stare so ! \" he said with animation, which was a little forced. There was, of course, no lack of questions. Much to be told of their visit and the pleasant day which Ellen had missed. There was a choice selection of flowers, sent by Mr. Vaughan, with a basket of grapes and some new books to cheer the \" invalid.\" \" Invalid ! \" said Granville. \" Is Ellen supposed to be an invalid ? \" \" OMy a headache,\" she murmured, and she tried to turn the subject. \" Well, she was very poorly tMs morning,\" said Bessie. \" Though I fancy after all it was half an excuse to get off the party. She is grown shockingly unsociable, Granville.\" Ellen tried not to look up, but something in him seemed to make her meet his eyes. And the light of satisfaction which burnt there frightened her. When the children were gone, there was a talk of plans. Granville spoke of Bessie's going to Poole on a visit for Christmas, and mentioned his intention of going to Germany. He lightly, and quite as a thing of course, told Bessie he was trying to persuade Ellen to join them there. \" Lily felt so lonely in a"], [260, "252 UPS AND DOWNS. foreign land, so much occupied as he necessarily was. It would be very good for her painting, and do her good in every way. In fact, why should not Bessie and the children come also? Such capital education, and so cheap ! Bessie demurred for herself, but agreed that it would be a nice thing for Ellen. Ellen grew flushed and uncomfortable, and said at last she really must go to bed. They did not urge her to remain. Granville lit her candle, and wished her good-night, and then hoped Bessie was in no hurry. \" It was so long since they had met.\" Ellen heard her sister hope he was not going to run away directly, but what he answered she could not tell. The next morning, directly Bessie found herself alone with her sister, she opened the subject of her going abroad with Granville and his wife, urging it as an excellent scheme, and saying \u2014 \" You know you need not mind about me. They wish me to make a trial of the Bank House. And for the children's sake, I ought to do so. So you are with out any ties.\" \" Wholly \u2014 an independent woman without a tie m the world ! \" Ellen interrupted, with sadness and bitter ness in the tone. \" Exactly ! so how nice to be with such old friends ! And you are so fond of Lily, too ! And you who have always wished so much to see other lands.\" \"Oh, Bessie! are you bhnd?\" Ellen groaned out, as she broke pencil after pencil, in her agitation. Bessie opened her eyes."], [261, "ROCKS AHEAD. 253 \" Yes, blind, I repeat ! Can't you think, \u2014 see, \u2014 remember?\" she said, passionately. \"Can't you fancy that it is not quite \u2014 that, in fact, Granville and I are not common friends, and far worse than enemies ! \" \" Is it possible? Oh, Ellen! How could he marry Lily, then ? Poor, poor Lily ! Poor creature ! \" and tears sprang to Bessie's pitying eyes. \" You seem to pity her,\" said Ellen, rather bitterly. \" Indeed I do ! Poor woman ! \" \" And you have no pity or feeling for others \u2014 for me, for instance, or for him ? \" \" It was his own fault. He did it knowing what he did. No ! I don't pity him, but blame him severely. As to yon, why, I thought it had come to nothing long, long ago. I thought you positively disliked Gran ville. As, indeed, I believed he in fact, I don't understand you, Ellen, I believe,\" and she sighed wearily. \" No, that is very true ! you believed that he con demned and disliked me. Well, however that was, the less now said the better. Please, Bessie, to remember that I can't and I won't live with or near him. No ! I dare not. Now do you comprehend ? \" she spoke with vehemence. Bessie looked puzzled still, and stared at her sister, who, with hurried movements, began to draw or attempt to do so. Then, with another deep sigh, she said some thing about ordering dinner, and rose to leave the room. \" Bessie, Bessie ! \" said Ellen, as she reached the door."], [262, "254 UPS AND DOWNS. \"Well?\" \" I shall be obliged to you thankful ! \u2014 Please don't leave me to entertain him alone! Do you understand ? \" \" Yes ; I suppose so,\" Bessie answered, in a sad, weary voice, as if she gave up everything as a puzzle, or a sorrow too heavy to bear. He stayed two days. At first Ellen continued to keep from all dreaded interviews, in spite of looks and hints she coidd not misunderstand. He tried to cheer up Bessie and to make friends with the children, but his answers to her many questions as to his home and his wife were dry and cold, and she shrank back from him, w*ondering, in her sad, slow way, what had so changed Granville. By dint of thinking very much about it, and considering over and over again Ellen's few passionate words, Bessie at last received an im pression that Granville's marriage was not only a bad connection but an unhappy step for himself. And then all her sympathy and her pity flew straight to the poor unloved wife. In this she forgot both her sister and Granville; and she gave great pain to Ellen by so perseveringly advocating his wish for her to go abroad with them, believing what he said, that it was Lily's great desire, and that Ellen's influence over her was good and valuable. Granville's manner of speaking entirely blinded her as to the true state of the case. She was quite ready to take his side of the argument, and urge"], [263, "ROCKS AHEAD. 255 Ellen, at the cost even of some pain to herself, to do all in her power to make up to \" poor Lily.\" Ellen was annoyed and hurt. She was annoyed at Granville's using his influence with Bessie, and persuading her so wrongly. Very painful feelings crossed her at times, for it is true pain to see one we love doing wrongly. One day, after being much irritated by this, and poor Bessie's ill-judged persuasions, Ellen forgot even to guard against being left alone with him. She had, in fact, forgotten the danger in her new feeling of anger towards him. So when Bessie left the room to attend some request of her children, Ellen was standing by the window, while Granville was outside. It was a low window, opening near the ground ; they were close together, therefore. Instantly all his pre vious manner was discarded : he dropped the tone in which he had been lightly yet urgently pressmg his suit with Bessie, bringing forw*ard such subtle arguments, and makmg it all appear so natural and right. A deep but sad expression was on his face, as he looked at her. \" At last ! Ellen, I thought you were going to let me leave without another word ! Come ! What do you say ? First, let me tell you, I am not going to be betrayed into the foolish, mad un-control of the other evening. Not unless you yourself drive me to it See, look at me ! I am calm.

Let it drop at least for the present. And now come out and take a turn with me. I want to go to the churchyard again. It is very long since I was there.\" At first she hesitated, but after all consented, leaving the room to fetch her bonnet and shawl. She jomed him at the low gate on which he was leaning, almost as grave and thoughtful as in old days. This mood continued. He spoke of his writings, and begmled her into an animated discussion. It was a pleasant, re viving day too, and the scene from the wild, quaint churchyard, about which so many legends weretold, was looking its best \" I don't wonder, after all, that you are fond of this place,\" he said, after watching her for a moment as she sat on the low wall, and looked over the wide spreading sea and cliffs. \" It is just the spot to be attached to \u2014 to make one's very own.

But his evident agitation and grief moved her to the soul ; she longed to comfort him.\" \" Perhaps \u2014 some years hence \u2014 when we are older, and wiser, we shall meet again, Granville. Meanwhile we can help one another in one way,\" she faltered out, as best she could. \" Yes, in one way \u2014 one only way,\" he broke in, suddeMy raising his face, and putting his arm round her. \" By Heavens ! I believe you are made of flint \u2014 of ice ! \"he cried, as she shrank from him. \" Ellen ! can you feel ? \u2014 can you ? \u2014 that you dare to go on talking m that strain of resolved, perverse coldness, refusing all I ask. I warned you ! I told you if you were wise you w*ould comply. It is you who drive me mad, beyond myself ! And now I say, what is there to hinder me ? You are mine \u2014 in my power,\" and he persisted in hold ing her tight \u2014 his eyes flashing with anger and passion.

He was entirely reckless. \" Yes, do you hear ? I entreat, I implore ! I haven't words,\u2014 but you know Ellen, you must, you shall hear me ! \" But she broke from him, her terror lending strength for the moment. \" God forgive you ! God pity you ! This is horrible ! \" she murmured, and then she turned away rapidly before he was aware of her mtention. She had seen w*hat in his bhnd passion he had not ob served, a carriage draw up by the church gate. She flew towards it, as one flees from some near and dreadful danger. Seeing Dr. Edgehill standing there and talk ing to a man, she recollected how her appearance would astonish him. Casting a hasty glance backwards, she just caught sight of Granville disappearing as he climbed the wall. A dreadful fear crossed her, for she knew that the wall led out to a steep, precipitous cliff, being, in fact, a part of the rock itself. The church tower served as a lighthouse to mariners, and overlooked the wildest part of the shore. But there was no time now for doubt. The Doctor was already advancing to meet her, and she had to do the best she could to meet and answer his questions. He remarked that she looked ill and tired, and she confessed she was so, and even asked him to give her a lift in his carriage to her home. Yet, it was agony to her, to leave without knowing where he w*as \u2014 to seem so cruel and unkind ! She was scarcely conscious of the drive back, or of what passed between herself and the Rector. She remem-"], [269, "ROCKS AHEAD. 261 bered afterwards, as if in a dream, that Bessie came out to the gate, and was surprised at seeing her sister return in that way, and asked where Granville was, and that she answered, she had lest him clambering about the rocks at the back of the church, and being tired had begged the Doctor to give her a lift. And then on stepping out of the carriage a sudden giddi ness seized her \u2014 not actual fainting, but something like it \u2014 making her sufficiently ill to be laid on her own bed, and left at last, at her own request, to the solitude she craved for. It was quite late, after tea had been put off and then had grown cold, that Granville returned, looking so ill and so stern, that Bessie was at a loss whether to pet him up with kindness or to let him alone. He said he had been exploring, and Spoke of the strange caverns and jagged rocks, the wild, solitary spots which lay about this indented shore. He did not even ask for Ellen on wishing Bessie good-bye, saying he should be gone before she was up. Bessie went in to tell her sister how unhappy she was at poor Granville's evident dejection and gloom; and poured out her fears that he made poor Lily's home a very sad one. But Ellen had no answer to give."], [270, "262 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER XVIII. DRIFTING ALONE ON THE WLDE SEA. For a week and more Ellen kept to her own room, seeing no visitors, and sufficiently ill to stir Bessie up to incessant hurrying to and fro and considerable anxiety. Then, when she recovered enough to leave her room, pale and weak as she was, Ellen allowed herself no further leisure, but set about her usual occupation with a feverish energy. The first re-opening of her studio to the sitters from the Rectory caused her much excitement and dread. It showed in her manner, which was full of trepidation, and distressed Mr. Vaughan, deciding him that she was not strong enough to paint. But she persisted in doing so; only when all was over \u2014 when they were gone \u2014 and Bessie occupied with some domestic business, she would steal away to the cliff path, and not strong enough to venture dow*n, would stand there for half an hour gazing at the sea. For the rest of the even ing she was languid, pale, and still, and not attemptmg to be employed. \" Mrs. Edgeworth remarked how* delicate you looked, Ellen,\" Bessie said one evening, after scanning her sister's pale and wan face more observantly than usual."], [271, "DRIFTING ALONE ON THE WIDE SEA. 263 \"Did she?\" \" Yes, and Mr. Vaughan too. He begged me to take more care of you. What can I do ? You won't let me save you \u2014 you won't attend to what I suggest ! \" \" For 'won't ' put 'can't.' Depend on it, work \u2014 hard, tough work, is my best remedy, Bess ! I am only suffering now from reaction \u2014 suffering for previous careless living ! Besides you know, I beg you to re member that Mr. Vaughan can be no judge about me. He is prone, \u2014 fond like you, \u2014 of petting people, and getting up a case of sickness for the purpose. Non sense ! Why, his eyes were scarcely off the picture or the original once ! How eager he is about it !\" \" Very ! Yes, no doubt he is very much taken up with her.\" \" She takes good care that he shall be ! \" Ellen returned. \" Then to see him stroke me down meta phorically, as one does a cat, lest my irritable temper should make a spiteful stroke and mar the beauty of the face ! Poor man ! I do try him, I know, and so does the little baby lady, or I am much mistaken. Fancy any man of his age and standing, consenting to play with such a doll, much more tying himself to her for life ! Well ! he does it with his eyes open, or rather nothing is hidden if he chooses to see. She is no humbug, but genuine, even in the matter of pouting and sulking when put out.\" \" I shall be glad when he is married ! I dare say they will be happy. He can't be otherwise than kind and good. She is a fortunate girl. Ah, Ellen ! again I say"], [272, "264 UPS AND DOWNS. I am sorry you couldn't like him ! It is so strange that you should be unmarried.\" \" Why so ? You mistake, Bess ! It is very evident that it was altogether poor dear Worthy's getting up. Not that he was a humbug ; but he is easily led in some tMngs. At all events, it has died out very com pletely now*. And it is well it has done so ! When you go to Poole,\" Ellen went on, after a short silence, \" how very lonely it will be ! Once married, of course Mr. Vaughan will be more engaged elsewhere. I shall be alone indeed ! \" \" No, you must not. You must let this place and come \" \" To Poole ! Never ! never ! never ! \" \" Then somewhere else \u2014 perhaps with Hetty and Alick. Yes, that isn't a bad idea ! \u2014 at least, sometime hence.

But it is very terrible ! Poor Lily ! \" \" Dear sakes ! And how quiet it do seem to be sure ! Poor Miss Raymond will be moped to death here. 'Tis such a awful gloomy place at this season. The w*hid's enough to take the very flesh off a body's bones ! \" Such was the opinion of Anne, expressed to her fellow-servant, when, after a good deal of bustle, Mrs. John Mortimer and her two little girls, with sundry"], [273, "DRIFTING ALONE ON THE WIDE SEA. 265 bags and boxes, had driven away. They were gone to Poole, nominally on a trial visit. If it answ*ered, Bessie would make it her future home. The reasons in favour of this move were strong, and such as Ellen could not gainsay, even if she desired it. For it ensured the education of the little fatherless girls, and their future fortune. Perhaps Ellen, at the present moment, so far from mindhig their going, imagined herself glad. She was in a very uncomfortable state of spirits. All the previous intervals of animation and excitement had given way to a settled languor and dulness, from which she cared not to rise. There was to be a family gather ing at the Bank House. The married daughter, Mrs. Tonar, was to bring her husband and children from their far-off home. Granville and his family were to be there. Nor was Ellen left out, in this old-fashioned hospitable meeting. The Cecil Mortimers were urgent in bidding her welcome, and would scarcely admit her excuses. Ellen herself looked forward to her solitary Christmas with a kind of perverse pleasure. She made her friends at the Rectory really angry by refusing point-blank even to join their party for CMistmas-day. Mr. Vaughan was to be there, and the De Lisles ; but Ellen persisted in keeping the day alone. She wished to try the experiment, and see how it felt, she said, laughingly, to Mrs. Edgehill. That lady appealed to Mr. Vaughan for his opinion, and begged him to use his influence against the \" mad plan.\" He looked for a moment at Ellen, and then with a very deep sigh and a half mock manner, he deplored"], [274, "266 UPS AND DOWNS. the wilfulness of the sex in general, of Miss Raymond in particular ; but owned his utter want of persuasive power.\" At this moment little Marion Ives beckoned him to her, and with blushes, which Ellen saw and failed not to note and remember, she drew him aside and showed him a letter. There was always some little confidential aside-talk between these two. Ellen thought it very bad taste, and much more like playing w*ith a child than wooing a wife. The picture was finished, and gave great satisfaction to both Marion and Mr. Vaughan. For the present it was to be a secret. It was taken to Thorn Park, and a frame was sent for. Ellen vouchsafed no further inquiries respecting it, when once it had left her studio. A thick dark curtain seemed to have fallen between her and the world. She felt as if she had no longer a motive for exertion, hardly an interest in life ; and it was with a sort of dull and apathetic wonder that she found herself domg pretty much as usual. Ellen was, unconsciously to herself, m a state of transition ; and by a very painful process w*as beginning to feel her heart void. It was as if the prop of years had been suddenly wrenched away, and the poor clinging plant lay helpless on the ground. It was not now so much striving against an un lawful love \u2014 it was the death of this love, which poisoned her existence. The ground on which she had so long trodden was cut away from beneath her."], [275, "267 DRIFTING ALONE ON THE WIDE SEA. One prominent point in her character was that species of \"vanity\" (there is no other name for it) which, in a controlled form, is found in the pleasantest and most loveable beings, but which by undue fostering becomes an ugly flaw \u2014 the desire to please. She desired the good opinion and the preference of human beings. Her judgment of them was very much pro- portioned to the extent and quality of their liking for her. More than she knew, she valued being the chosen one of a person apt to be cold and unim- pressible to the world in general. This had been one great charm in her early intercourse with Granville. She was touched by being the only one, save her own mother, for whom his habitual reserve was con- quered. TMs increased as they both grew older and his feelings deepened. The more severe and inexorable was Ms judgment of others, the higher his standard, so much more subtle and sweet was the implied flattery of being the one his eye delighted in and his taste approved. It fascinated her. The very difficulties, too, which had intervened had served to rivet all her deeper feelings on him. With others she might laugh and chatter; she might be pleased with the homage of the crowd ; but, deeper and deeper amid all, his image sank in her heart. Even while he sternly misjudged her, and she resented it, her heart bowed down before him : she owned him her master. When he was cold and distant, her pulses throbbed the hotter and quicker. For through all there was an intuitive knowledge that he loved her ! But now,"], [276, "268 UPS AND DOWNS. all was changed. In a fit of pride and passion she had not deemed him capable of, he had married one woman while preferring another. Where, then, was his earnest stedfastness of purpose \u2014 his faithfulness, his self-control ? He talked of love wMch was \" divine and exalted,\" but had he given proof of capability to feel it? In marrying, as he had done, in a fit of impetuous impatience, he had low*ered Mmself \u2014 lowered the whole tone of his former attachment. Then again, not capable of abiding by what he had done, he had stepped down from his pedestal and had sought to bring her with him. In direct opposition to the prm ciples of his life, he had tried to persuade her. He bent the knee to win her consent \u2014 to what ? To sin ! positive, hateftd sm ! It was this which was un doing the old charm. So long as he had remained her judge, her superior, so long her heart must have been his \u2014 ay, unto death : at least so far that no other should reign in his place. But the spell was broken: respect was destroyed ; he was no longer her master. It was very painful. Her heart was sore and sick ; she was irritable, restless, wincing at everything. No wonder if her cheek paled and her hands shook. No wonder that her ow*n servants whispered together at her \" dull and lonely \" look \u2014 at her langmd step, when she did go out, or her dreamy attitude, when she sat all day, hour after hour, doing nothing. In this state of things did Christmas-tide approach. But Ellen was not destined to eat her Christmas dinner alone after all."], [277, "269 CHAPTER XIX. WELCOME GUESTS. \" Some one at the door ! \" remarked the maid as she laid the tea-things on Christmas Eve. She was in the habit of making what remark she could, in order to get an answer. For Anne took her mistress's state to heart. \" It is the messenger I sent to enquire for Mr. Clare,\" Ellen answered. \" No, he came half an hour ago. And I quite forgot to say, miss, that Mrs. Clare's compliments, and Mr. Clare was just the same.\" \" Hark ! there is some one outside ! Take a light, Anne, and see.\" There was a look of intense anxiety on Ellen's face, as she stood grasping the back of the chair nervously, and almost holding her breath to listen. Who could it be ? \" By Jove ! what a place ! will the trunk get through that apology for a door ? Have a care ! Well, and so you say Miss Raymond is at home ? Does she live in darkness ? or is a farthing candle more romantic, I wonder? Now, be so good as to announce Mr. and Mrs. Hay.\""], [278, "270 UPS AND DOWNS. These words reached Ellen ; at least enough of them to give her a clue. The voice completed the enlighten ment. \" Is it possible ! \" she exclaimed, suddenly runnmg to the door. \" Ah, Nelly, didn't expect visitors, did ye ? \" called out Alick from his muffled throat as he paid the post boy, while a cloaked and furred figure, tall and ele gant, even hi that costune, rushed to her with open arms. \" Hetty ! \" \" Ellen !\" was all that passed, as they gazed at each other. \" Hallo there ! \" said Alick, now coming forward hat in hand. \" Moderation, Hetty. I come hi for my share, if you please. Come, Ellen ! for a right good brotherly and sisterly kiss I will have ! There's one for the new relationship, and here goes one for the old.

Had you given me notice, I would have treated you better.\" \" AVell, we knew you had room, as Bessie was gone ; and Alick wouldn't write. I begged him to do so, Ellen, but he would not,\" said Hetty. \" 'Twould have spoilt all the fun. Dear me ! this is cosy after that bleak moor ! What a place to pitch on, Ellen !

Hetty's sisterly feelings pointed to this rock ; and as I am a brow-beaten, amiable husband, who hasn't an inch of his own way \u2014 here we are ! Well, and what do you think of her ? \" pointing to Hetty. \" Isn't she a very fair specimen of a Raymond ? \u2014 a credit to Mrs. Harding's establishment, and the pride and joy of your humble servant\" \" I doubt if I should have known her in a strange place,\" Ellen remarked, looking seriously at the strik ingly beautiful girl. \" But you are the same, Alick. As great a madcap as ever, I fear ; and not at all old and digmfied enough to be a married man.\" \" Ask her privately whether I am or not. My force of character, you see, makes up for youthful ap pearance.\" After a while he said : \" Ellen, you are not looking as well as you should. I see you are not flourishing on this rock. Well, well ! To-morrow we will talk over our plans. Why, old girl, 'tis very cosy to see you again ! Hetty will have to look out, for, as I always told her, my first affections were devoted to you.

Not a fellow in the regiment can come up to me.\" \" The horse comes first, I observe,\" said Ellen. \" No. Oh, no ! The wife comes first. Why, she is not so anxious herself as I am, or so clever either, about her dress and all that. I coaxed mammy out of her turquoise set \u2014 very fine ones, and I got them reset. Ah ! but they suit Hetty well, I can tell you ! \" So he rattled on, with inexhaustible spirits, till bed time. They seemed well suited, and fit to dance through life together as long as dancing was possible ; and then there seemed too much sunshine of heart to fear but that even their soberer walk would be any thing but happy. Hetty was pleasant and communicative ; m many ways better than Ellen expected to find her ; but there was more affection in Alick, with all his jokes. And when both used every entreaty and persuasion to induce her to follow their fortunes, and share their home, it was Alick who gave the true brotherly welcome. It was impossible to help feeling that he w*ished it. This visit was of great service to Ellen. Not till long afterwards was she aw*are what a boon it was, and then she shuddered to think what it had saved her from. Christmas-day was not lonely. Alick had fun for the whole house, and the two servants could not say enough in praise of the \" handsome young officer\" and his \" beautiful, heligant wife.\" He persuaded Ellen,"], [281, "WELCOME GUESTS. 273 too, to accept the repeated invitation which came from the Edgehills directly they knew of her guests' arrival. So they all three went there for the evening. While sitting round the fire at the Rectory, and laughing at Alick's absurd stories, a messenger came to say that Mr. Clare, of Blair Hall, w*as dead. He had been long ill ; yet the end was not expected so soon. This broke up the party, and Dr. Edgehill looked very grave, for, if rumour was true, the son who would now succeed the father did not give pro mise of being so good a landlord and squire. \"Pray, Nelly, is that the Mr. Vaughan?\" Alick enquired, as they drove home. \" What do you mean by ' the?'\" \" Why, Mrs. Ullathorne's heir and Miss Raymond's admirer.\" \" He is Mrs. Ullathorne's heir, certainly.\" \" And has he carried his devotion to another shrine ? Is it supposed that he is sweet on that little doll?\" \" What slang you do talk,\" Ellen answered, not without a little shy consciousness. \" Hetty, don't let him do so ! That ' little doll,' as you call her, is quite the fashion here ; partly because there is no other girl pretending to good looks. Young Clare was said to admire her, and was sent abroad to break it off. I fear he could hardly be at home now.\" It turned out as Ellen supposed ; the son was not in time to see his father, but he attended the funeral. A day or so after that event, Ellen was not a httle vol. in. X"], [282, "274 UPS AND DOWNS. surprised by the Clares' man of business calling on her. The wonder was increased when she learnt his errand, which was to tell her that in the reading of the late Mr. Clare's will she was left 5,000?., \" as a tribute of respect for the proper spirit she had shown under her disappointment and reverse of fortune.\" When she came to talk it over with Dr. Edgehill, and was really assured that sum was lawfully and rightfully hers, it helped to alter her views. It raised her to a comfortable independence. She need never touch a brush or pencil again. Alick made much of it, and called her a rich woman, and insisted on her health being drunk in bumpers. He and Hetty remained at the Cottage for a month, when he was summoned to join his regiment at Portsmouth. There was a rumour they woidd soon go to Guernsey. And Alick assured Ellen, it was the very place she would like. What was there to keep her ? Did she mean to live alone ? She accepted the invitation for a time, but positively affirmed, \" only for a time.\" She must have her own home somewhere ; it would not suit her to give that up, however much she might like visiting among friends. Just now, she felt she should be the better for a change. For many reasons, she would be glad to leave the neighbourhood. She would not give up the cottage ; she liked to have the power of retiring there when she liked ; but she particularly wished her plans not to be spoken much of. It came to pass at last that, without a soul's knowing"], [283, "WELCOME GUESTS. 275 it, she left rather suddenly with her sister and brother, going straight with them to Portsmouth. Ellen found that leaving her beloved rock w*as some what trying, but she roused herself to endure the, to her, new life which surrounded her. At times the high spirits of Alick and his wife were rather too much ; for very anxious thoughts weighed her down. Bessie wrote very fully, speaking of the family gathering at the old Bank House and all the \"extreme\" kindness she met with ; as if they couldn't do enough for her and the children. Only one thing was sad, and that everyone remarked, i. e., the alteration in poor Gran ville. \"He is an altered man, Ellen!\" she wrote. \" Don't tell me he is happy ! He is wretched and reckless. There is no real union between him and his wife. I pity her, though the others blame her. Poor soul ! She confides in me ; and only think, dear Ellen, Granville, whom we used to think so steady and so good, is often quite excited, so she says, and uses cruel words to her. Is'nt this dreadful ? And oh ! if you were to see and hear him, you would be as shocked as we all are. He looks so bad, so changed, so hollow and ill, and yet with such high spirits, only they are not natural. Lily cries her eyes red, and then he is cross with her. How I do pity her ! They are going to Munich directly. She says it will be better there.

He must think more of you than of Hetty ! you are so clever, Ellen ! I can't help wishing you w*ere going with Granville and Lily, as proposed. There you might be of great use perhaps ; and poor Lily seems so much to wish it. She even asked me to beg you ! \" &c. &c."], [285, "277 CHAPTER XX. ONWABDS. Onwards ! Another leap ! Thrice has Christmas come and gone, since Ellen spent it with her young married sister and brother-in-law at the old Cliff Cottage. It is now early spring, and the day tempts everyone out into fields and lanes, where the young green may refresh the eye and heart. The two sisters, Ellen and Hetty, were sitting together. They were mourning for their father. Colonel Raymond had died about nine months be- fore, never recovering his memory, but gradually growing more and more feeble and childish. The only being he ever knew was his wife, but the pre- sence of his daughter Ruth was always soothing and pleasant. With her gentle disposition she had, when left to herself, found a peaceful and even happy home with her father's second wife. She wrote to assure her sisters she had no wish or intention of leaving her \" mother,\" and had accompanied her from Nice, where Colonel Raymond died, to Rome. At their father's death each of his daughters received 2,000?. Everything\" in his own power (which was"], [286, "278 UPS AND DOWNS. not much) went to his present wife. The clause in this will which surprised everyone, was a legacy of 1,000?. for Lily Day, left in trust to Cecil and Gran ville Mortimer. Ellen lived principally with Alick and Hetty ; now and then she left them, and took a lodging for herself, but it was more for the sake of assertmg her freedom and independence. She liked bemg with them ; and knew* that the liberal contributions she was able to make to the housekeeping fund was of import ance to them. Though it is but justice to remark that such a calculation never entered their heads, when they pressed her so cordially to share their home. But Alick's old habits were not in favour of economical housekeeping, and then* only difficulty or hindrance to happiness was the constant failure m their attempts to live within their income. They were too popular and too gay to live quietly. Their house was always the favourite resort to all idlers ; the pleasantest and most sociable of meetings took place in their drawing room. Hetty, without children, was still a lovely \" girl ; \" and Ellen, though altered since we first mtro duced her, w*as still much admired, and even courted. She had been more than once sought m marriage, and that by what Alick called eligible \" parties.\" He constantly rallied her on her fixed deternhiiation to be an old maid. But as he said it was very dis interested hi him to press the point, as he was only too content to keep her to themselves to care how many hearts she broke. \" Well,\" Hetty was saying, \" if Alick comes back"], [287, "ONWARDS. 279 in time, you and he can have a walk. I must stay at home, or I shall not be ' up' to this party, and I have letters to w*rite. By the way, were yours satis factory ? \" \" Tolerably. Bessie is far from well, I fear, though she says little about it The one from old Mrs. Edge hill is a great relief to me, for she is very good, and doesn't scold very much.\" \" What news does she give ? \" \" None. At least, she says that Marion Ives is to be married next June, which wre had heard before, and they go to India.\" \" What a long, tiresome engagement ! That is con stancy, if you please ! And w*hat is become of the one you fancied she would marry, that pleasant man \u2014 what's his name ? \" \" Vaughan, Mr. Vaughan ? No one seems to know w*here he is. He went abroad last winter twelvemonth ; Mrs. Edgehill doesn't mention him.\" After this the conversation dropped. Both sisters became silent, and engrossed with their own thoughts ; Hetty considering the arrangements for her party, and Ellen going over a track, which, if the truth was known, her thoughts were apt to go. She sorely missed her friend, and wished she only knew something about him. Never till now had she sufficiently valued Mr. Vaughan's constant, ever ready sympathy and affec tionate regard. She was uneasy about him too, hearing a vacue rumour of his being out of health ; and, recal ling the coldness of her manner at their last interview,"], [288, "280 UPS AND DOWNS. she would have given much for an opportunity to remove that impression. But she must have utterly disgusted and alienated him, and in her folly had lost her best friend ! Such reflections often clouded her countenance, though, perhaps, this was the first and only time that his name had been mentioned by her or others. The difference which years had made in Ellen, was very visible under this grave and sad expression. The brilliant bloom of her complexion was gone, but the transparent delicacy remained. She was pale always. The quick changes in her face, and her eager, impulsive manner, had given way to a staid, serious carriage, in which a quiet, chastened repose was the most remark able feature. There were times when she grew even sad, and when she was glad to retreat for a while from the exuberant joyousness, the never-failing prosperity and thorough easy-going content of Alick and his wife. But these \" fits of low spirits,\" as Hetty called them, w*ere few and far between, and even, if felt, seldom allowed to be seen by others. Just at this time Ellen was considering some future plan of life, confessing that, pleasant as it was, she could not much longer \" follow the regiment ; \" that in fact, as she grew older, it was necessary for her peace of mind to have a fixed home, where she might find work and duties naturally spring up round her. Her old place of refuge was destroyed. The cottage on the rock had been burnt to the ground just two years ago, \"all owing to its being lived in by a witch, of course,\" said the villagers. The"], [289, "ONWARDS. 281 fire had broken out one very stormy night, so that by the time the alarm was given, it was too late to save anytMng. The old woman who lived there to \" keep \" the house had a narrow escape, and all Ellen's trea sures of furniture and books, \u2014 everything, in fact, wMch it was inconvenient to carry about with her, \u2014 perished in the flames. \"Like everything connected with the Raymonds,\" had been her remark on hearing the news. \" Every thing seems destined to destruction that our family has touched ! \" For some time she w*as as one mourning for a friend. But she said little. It was a subject which she always shrank from discussing. The cottage was not rebuilt. The situation was not such as to tempt anyone to become a tenant. On its site soon arose a limekiln, while up and down the steep cliff path, formerly so often trodden by Ellen, a string of donkeys laden with limestones might be seen passing and repassing all day long. Where once \" the garden grew,\" carts from all parts of the country stood about, waiting for their loads of lime, which was taken to very distant parts for manure. \" Ah ! here he comes at last,\" said Hetty, gaily, drawmg her head back from the window. \" Now get ready, Ellen, and pray bring me home a primrose or a violet ! \" Ellen waited to know if Alick was disposed to give her a walk, and then with his answer, \"Yes, yes ! but be quick ! \" she left to make ready."], [290, "282 UPS AND DOWNS. \" I asked the Dicksons, Hetty ; they will come \u2014 jolly girls as they are, I will say ! And who do you suppose I fell foul of just by the hotel, and of course asked him to look in ? You won't guess ! \" \" No, indeed ! unless it be \" Vaughan ! \" Alick interrupted, quickly, too eager to keep his secret long. \" Do you remember Mr. Vaughan ? \" \" What ! the man Ruth is always raving about ? we were just mentioning him ; Ellen said he was abroad.\" \" The same. Don't you remember we met him that Christmas at the Edgehills ! He was, deny it as much as she likes, an old follower of Nell's. And to tell you truth, I suspect he is not sorry to have the prospect of meeting her to-night. His eyes told a httle tale. He is a gentlemanly fellow, none of your high and mighty un-come-at-ables.\" \" Have you ordered the flowers, Alick ? \" \" No : forgot it ! Ellen and I w*ill go that way, but there are not many to be had at Jones's , and precious dear they are.\" \" Yes ; but for a party like this, indispensable. Ellen and I mean to sport camellias ! \" \" Do you ? Well, I don't, object.

But I had the benefit; I generally had, you see ! She came to me for comfort. Do you doubt it ? Well, who would have thought that I should have had you, a little sharp, pert thing in pinafores, as you were ! and who would have thought that Ellen Raymond the belle, the nicest girl out and out in the county, and between ourselves no end of a flirt too, should be grown into so serious a character, and precious near spinsterhood too ! Not but that she is uncommonly good-looking now, and much admired by some persons. But it is in quite another style. What can ail her, eh, Hetty ? Is she crossed in love, or is she keeping an eye on being a Sister of Mercy, or, in plain English, a sour, cross old maid. The fellows are puzzled, and besiege me with questions which I can't answer. She is cold to all. But time is jogging on, and if she doesn't take care \" \"What is that?\" said Ellen, show*ing herself at the door, and putting on her gloves. \" If who doesn't take care, Alick ? \" \" You ! I am talking of you ; and I say you will be an old maid. By the way, Nellie, look here, look at me \u2014 look me fair in the face ! Now, whom do you suppose I met just now ? A great friend of yours, an old flame, too.\" \"Alick!\" \" No ; nothing to scare you pale. He is a harmless gentleman, and a pleasant, though he may have pre-"], [292, "284 UPS AND DOWNS. sumed to admire Miss Raymond. Tell us, Ellen, wasn't Mr. Vaughan an old sweetheart ? \" \" Vaughan ! \" Do you mean you saw Mm, Alick ? \" \" Ay, truly ; and he is coming here to-night. Look, Hetty ! isn't that blush charming ? Ah, sister Nellie, grave as you are, you have not forgotten how to blush. Come, let us be going. Hetty ! keep quiet, please, and don't be ' a over-hexherting' yourself, as abigail Jane says.\" And with a bow to his wife, he left the room ; and walking fast and talking faster still, he took Ellen, first to the florist's, to order bouquets for the adorning of their room and table, and then on, past the streets, by fields and along lanes, pleasant with the fresh greenery of spring. It was a rather small room for the party assembled ; but being double, and opening on to an unusually spacious landing-place, which was judiciously filled up with seats, it both looked well, and also served to place the guests better than many a larger place. Ellen and Hetty were clever in arranging chairs and sofas, so as to prevent all formal circles. All the regiment ladies and the officers were there, and a sprinkling besides of people in the tow*n. Every one knew each other well, so much so that it would have been an awkward party to a greater stranger. A round game was proposed, but several preferred"], [293, "ONWARDS. 285 not playing, and formed little coteries in corners, or tete-k-tetes, as might be. Hetty stood by the pianoforte, turning over music with a lady she was persuading to sing. She and Ellen were dressed alike, in black, of course, with a good deal of soft lace, and white camellias in their hair and sash. Very striking they were, and much alike : Hetty rather the taller of the two, and her hair the lighter. Hetty was like w*hat Ellen was ; Ellen was changed, as Alick had said, \"serious\" was the right word for her, in appearance and manner. And, after her experience, who can wonder at her being sobered? There were moments even at this time, when she shuddered to remember how very near she had been to danger. It made her a more humble and thankful woman for her life; more indulgent to others, for she knew how rapid is the downward course, and how hidden is the end thereof. Unlike the common herd she surely was. She did not seek attention, or appear the least excited or moved when she received more than her fair share. She took it as a matter of course. She was, as she had ever been, w*holly unaffected. She was liked, and a little feared. According to Ahck, the major and the surgeon were very desperately in love. There was also a certain young poet, rather a character in his way, very fond of spending his evemngs at Mrs. Hay's house. He did not attempt to hide his admiration, but loudly bewailed his poverty, apparently assuming that this was the only obstacle which came between him and"], [294, "286 UPS AND DOWNS. his hope. He was very devoted ; ever at her side, or on the watch to serve her. He stood now rather behind the sofa on which she sat, one hand on its back and the other twirling the cusMon tassel in a very fidgetty way, while Ellen divided her attention as well as she could between him and a young, shy woman, lately married into the regiment, and now very full of her troubles concerning servants. It taxed Ellen's powers to listen to this and to give her advice, and also to prevent Mr. Richmond from taking offence, and thereby sorely disturbing the harmony of the evening, a trick he had now and then. She had taken one sweeping and keen survey of the room, and then sat still as a statue, except when she turned her face from the lady to the gentleman. At last, to her relief, some one else came up to address the lady, and he stood somewhat in front of the sofa and shut out a view of the door. Mr. Richmond seized his opportunity and claimed her ear. She turned towards him. Meanwhile, some little stir was made in the room by forming a second table for commerce, and just then there was an arrival. Alick received Mr. Vaughan at the door, and would have brought him up to his wife, but that his attention was claimed, and Mr. Vaughan said he should make his own way and see if he was remembered. He stood by the door, Ms quick eye scanning the groups, and passing over many a braided head, till it rested on one which caused a sudden flash to light up every feature. He made a"], [295, "ONWARDS. 287 movement as if to go forward, but yet remained stationary, looking eager and somewhat perplexed. Then he slowly turned away his eye and again swept the room, but no further light of recognition was kindled. He made his way quietly to where Hetty stood and claimed her acquaintance in his own cordial fashion. He explained how he met her husband, having only landed from the packet the day before, and but for that meetmg, he should have been on the road to London. He had been in Paris for some time. He had not been at home for months, he was almost ashamed to say. He could not answer her questions at all. He had been away nearly two years. He had returned rather suddenly at last ; but he was so thoroughly sick of exile \u2014 so glad to be in England again.\" \" Ellen will be so glad to see you ; it was but yester day that we remarked to one another how long it was since we heard of you,\" Hetty said. \" Is she here ? Is your sister here to-night ? For one instant I took you for her just now. But even as he spoke, the light had arisen in his eye again, for the gentleman moved away and allowed Mm to see Ellen herself. She was still listenmg to Mr. Richmond, her profile towards Mr. Vaughan ; her hands folded in perfect repose on her lap. \" There she is, as usual, monopolised by that most exigeant of creatures \u2014 a literary man,\" said Hetty. \"Authors are always bores, are they not? Oh, I"], [296, "288 UPS AND DOWNS. hope you don't write ; do you ? But Ellen likes the sort of thing and has patience \u2014 I have not. Do go and take her from Mm ; I see by her face she is not really attending to him. Her thoughts are far away at this moment. I coidd half believe she hears me, and is conscious that I talk of her and want her to look this w*ay. There! didn't I say so?\" Hetty exclaimed, laughing, for at the very moment Ellen slowly turned, and, straight as an arrow, her eyes were directed first to the door and then to her sister. But if she w*as pale before, there was colour now, rising, deepening, even as she looked, and a smile of pleasure, yet not free from shyness, passed over her face. A few steps brought him to her side, and her hand once more felt that peculiarly hearty, fervent shake, to which it had of late been a stranger. It drew a cry of pain, for he pressed the rmgs, so that she could not bear it. \" Your old way ! I forgot to take off my ring as I used to do \u2014 do you remember ? \" \" You see I have not forgotten my John Bull habit, though I have lived so long among foreigners,\" Mr. Vaughan said. \" Have you ? I w*ondered w*here you were.\" \" You thought of me sometimes, then ? \" He stopped and looked at her with grave and considering aspect ; then at her neighbour, the some what disconcerted Mr. Richmond, who stuck his glass in his eye, and made a face expressive of anything but pleasure at the interruption. Mr. Vaughan examined him rather closely, and wished he would vacate that"], [297, "ONWARDS. 289 chair. But no: he settled himself in it with a more determined shove, and was now intent on twirlmg the said glass, his never-failing toy and source of in spiration. \" Do you live here with Mr. and Mrs. Hay? \" asked Mr. Vaughan. \"Practically I do, though I profess to have my own home. But smce the poor old Cottage was burnt \u2014 ah ! wasn't that sad ? \u2014 all my precious furniture too brought from my mother's own room \" \" Sad indeed,\" he answered. \" I was truly sorry to hear of it. If they had only left its ruins ! I had a serious thought of buying of farmer Lewis, but they said it was a public benefit to have the kiln there. Ah ! you should not have so deserted your old home ! '' \" Would you have had me live alone all this time ? \" she said. \" Hardly,\" he answered, taking possession of the seat by her on the sofa which the lady had just left, being beckoned over by her husband, in true marital fashion, to play out Ms game. \" But was there any need for such a very sudden move \u2014 so mysterious too ! I assure you I began to wonder ! And not one word \u2014 one line \" \" Yes ; I left in a hurry, I know, but only for a time \u2014 on a visit, as I thought. I was in great need of a change, and then only think ! I have never been there since. And I heard after some time that you had lest ; no one knew where you were.\" \" And, pray, had you no pens and ink, or had you lost vol. in. u"], [298, "290 UPS AND DOWNS. the use of your hands ? for not one of all your friends and well-wishers seemed to hear from you according to Mrs. EdgeMU's account to me.\" \"I know* I behaved shamefully \u2014 very, very badly, ungratefully to Mrs. Edgehill. I have written since : I resolved to venture, knowmg I deserved to have it returned. It was about a fortnight ago I think. I was treated better than I deserved, for I heard this very mormng : she told me she had been much hurt, but she forgave me.\" \" Have you chanced to hear or Do you know, Ellen\" he broke off abruptly, and with a tone and look of sudden sadness, \" that your old playfellow, my niece, is, \u2014 in fact, it is for her I wear tMs black?\" \"No, indeed!\" she answered, much shocked. \"Is it really so ? How and when was it ? \" Just after the birth of her child, some months ago now. Properly speaking, I suppose my term of mourn ing is expired, but she was my one relation ! Only from her lips did I hear my name. It may seem strange to you, but, do you know, I look on tMs circumstance as one of saddest and dreariest signifi cation ! \" Ellen looked puzzled. \"I mean the never being addressed by one's bap tismal name, the name of childhood. To be ' Mr.,' or at best, ' Vaughan,' to every one, tells its own tale of isolation.\" He spoke so very mournfully and looked so grave, she longed to cheer him."], [299, "291 ONWARDS. \"Do you know,\" she began \u2014 then stopped, looked up and went on again \u2014 \" it surprises me that it should be so. I mean, that when I last saw you, I fancied, I believed \u2014 that is,\" she said, growing more and more confused \u2014 \" I heard you were \" \" Go on ! were \u2014 what ? \" \" We quite made up our minds that \u2014 that you were gomg to marry ; and I meant to say, I suppose you would not be Mr. Vaughan to every one then !\" She was looking down, her fingers nervously playmg with her fan. The embarrassment and agitation were so different from her previous quiet and composed demeanour, it could not but strike him. Her face flushed painfully. \"I beg your pardon,\" she whispered, hastily, without lifting her eyes, finding he said nothing. \"Perhaps I ought not to have said so. I beg your pardon ! \" \" You did not speak very clearly. \u2014 Did you think so ? or did you allude to mere joking gossip ? Tell me.\" \" Yes \u2014 I thought so. Certainly I did.\" She spoke in a still more flurried manner, fearing she had unwittingly annoyed him. Glancing up m his face qiuckly, she was surprised to see a look of bright, eager joy. He was flushed, too, and his lips trembling ads wishing to speak, but something bid him wait. His eyes were bent on the floor as if taking counsel, the brow slightly drawn into a considering look, but all the lower part of the face was, as it were, steeped in sunshme. Not every countenance could express so much, and with such peculiar sweetness. With a quick gesture he u 2"], [300, "292 UPS AND DOWNS. raised his head, and bent forwards to address her with a wistful, pleading smile. But Hetty glided swiftly in front of them. \" Ellen dear, please to shig ! Just as the greatest possible favour ! Yes ; I know your objec tion \u2014 your rule. But rules, even grammar rules, always have such long lists of exceptions. Just to please Mr. Vaughan now ! She is growing so frightfully rude, and stiffened, Mr. Vaughan, an inevitable leamng to wards old-maidemsm, I fear ! Do, Ellen, sing one song ! Ask her, Mr. Vaughan ! \" But he did not seem very anxious for it. He had turned aside with a look of disappointment as Hetty first approached. Now he forced himself to understand her words, and on her repeating her request for him to persuade Ellen, he said \u2014 \" Will you ? \" Without a word, after a moment's pause, Ellen arose ; all hurry and shyness gone, pale and still, and as if performing some mere duty, she accepted Mr. Vaughan's arm, and took her seat. He asked if he could find her music. \" Thank you, no music!\" and she sang from memory. He had often heard her sing that very song ; it w*as one of Mrs. Wentworth's. Ellen was in good voice ; clear and full, it rose above the smothered din of the card-players and the chink of the mother-of-pearl counters. When it was done, she drew on her gloves ; several gentlemen and one lady surrounded her with a buzz of admiration and entreaties for another. This she quietly but positively declined ; and she looked round as if to find an opening to recede. But"], [301, "293 ONWARDS. they seemed to push in further, till quite a ring formed round the music stool. Mr. Vaughan gave way, but without a look of vexation, though. Mr. Richmond again took his place by Ellen, and when he found that she was sincere in not wishing to sing again, he consented with much pressing to give them a ballad of his own composing. Of course it was about love ; a very doleful and despairing ditty, and Ellen's risible muscles were not a little tested, when she, looking up, caught from afar Alick's very meaning smile, and a short pantomime by which he fully contrived to express his entire sympathy with the words, \" With thee, love ! with thee, I'd lay me down to die ! \" the refrain of Mr. Rich mond's song. Supper proved a welcome interruption. Ellen's eye sought Mr. Vaughan, and found him sitting apart, and still that considering look, half-pleased and half doubting, which she had before seen. \" Why doesn't he see that it is supper-time, and save me from the infliction of Mr. Richmond ? \" she thought ; when even at her elbow stood the subject of her thoughts and fear. But Mr. Richmond was not naturally qmck, and Alick, who probably thought Ellen had had enough of a good thing, hastily strode across the room ! \" Ellen ! oh, Mr. Vaughan, may I ask you to take my sister ? Mr. Richmond, will you take care of my wife?\""], [302, "294 UPS AND DOWNS. It was a bold stroke, and somewhat out of rule, as Hetty afterwards told him. \" Exactly ! \" he answered ; \" one of those efforts of moral courage and fitness for an emergency which dis tinguished Nelson. I felt myself half an inch Mgher for it all the evening ! \""], [303, "295 CHAPTER XXI. COMING INTO PORT. \" I hardly expected that a time would come when your singing could be unpleasant to me,\" was Mr. Vaughan's remark, as together they went along the somewhat narrow passage and stairs leading to the Alick Hays' dimng-room, with that inflection of voice wMch made it anything but commonplace. \" I gave it up as a lost evenmg ! \" he went on. \" Why, you are more sought, more surrounded than ever! An old stager like myself has no chance.\" \" I looked up, hoping you woMd see me and come to the rescue, but you wrere so very deep in your own dreams. I hope, by the way, they were pleasant,\" she said, gaily, determined not to be so silly and confused agam. \" Your brother-in-law is delightful,\" he rejoined. \" May I suppose \u2014 may I hope the two peremptory orders just now were not distasteful? May I think this ? \" \" WeU, I think you may really suppose so much, considering how long we \u2014 how long it is smce I saw you,\" she ended, more rapidly than she began. There was here some little crowding about the door."], [304, "296 UPS AND DOWNS. \" I fear the table will hardly hold all,\" Ellen said. \" Suppose we wait a little ; will you mind doing so ? \" \" Not at all, let us wait here,\" and he led her across the hall to the study, the door of which was temptingly open. \" This temperature is grateful after the other room,\" she remarked. He did not answer tMs, or one or two other attempts she made at an easy chat. She wondered and grew uneasy, but would not show it. \"If we wait here five minutes, they will be all seated, and we can join the supper party,\" she said. \" Ah, here is the badger Alick killed the other day ; he had it stuffed ; is it supposed to be well done, I wonder? \" Mr. Vaughan mechanically stooped to examine it, but his next words were scarcely apposite. \" Ellen, I want an answer to my question. Did you yourself believe that \u2014 in fact, did you believe that rumour ? \" \" Mr. Vaughan ! \" she exclaimed, but meeting his look, added, \" Why, I said I did!\" \" And may I ask \u2014 I must ask \u2014 I must know, what did you think of it?\" he rejomed. After a pause, she said, \" As it seems to have been unfounded, I don't see the use of the question.\" \" It was of course unfounded. Marion Ives is now about to be married to the young man to whom she was in fact engaged before she ever came to the Edgehills'. He was poor and friendless, and he was disapproved of. I happened to know him, and this led her to confide in"], [305, "COMING INTO PORT. 297 me ; in fact, she made me a confidant. It so chanced that I was able to help young Lytton, so that now he has gained a situation under Government, which enables him to stand forth, and woo and win her. It was for Mm I got the picture, but you believed it was for myself ? I did not tMnk of that at the time ; I was much with her, I was not in the brightest of spirits, and she was a good-humoured, affectionate little girl. You know, Ellen, something, I don't know what, made you very cold to me just then.\" \" You know whom I met suddenly and by accident at Fernshore, don't you ? \" Ellen asked, shortly, and turning her face away as she spoke. \" Yes, I know ; I heard all ! Believe me, I knew and felt how great had been the shock, mentally and bodily. I trust it has passed. Don't let us speak of it now ! \" \" One thmg I must say !

Did she, after all, so forget all our talks, all our agreements \u2014 all my repeated prayers ? Are you sure ? It could not be her ! \" \" Yes, it was her.

I don't think you can know the misery of the suspense I have had !

I went everywhere \u2014 up the Nile to the Falls, across the desert on a camel, saw the Pyramids, drew, collected curiosi ties, cultivated a beard \u2014 all in vain !

Yes; after deep consideration I resolved to ask you once more \u2014 only once. Ellen, the time is come \u2014 will you hear me ? \" He paused a moment, breatMess, not looking at her. Of course she coMd not speak. It was as much as she could do to stand quietly there. But for some thing of the kind she had nerved herself, and she mustered all her powers of self-control to meet the moment. \"Ellen,\" he said, using all the rapid gesticulation which was natural to him when much excited, and, as he spoke, taking a few hurried steps to and fro : \" Ellen, all I ever said to you that night at the Duke's ball \u2014 do you remember \u2014 it stands now!

The long-restramed, intense earnestness of his love had, at last, broken down all barriers ; and it had at last conquered. When, after a few moments, she looked at Mm, she saw tears in Ms eyes. Again and again he pressed her hand to his lips and to his forehead.

EUen became the wife of Edward Vaughan before the summer was m its prime. It did not appear that his long love had worn itself out He made a good husband, as well as bemg at all times the pleasantest of companions. ThorougMy engrossed in the almost idolismg love he bore Ms wife, he never seemed aware of the fact that he gave more than he received. His nature was not one wMch reflected self, and this was the true source of Ms happiness. His entire freedom from all tamt of egotism was as genume, and as much a part of his nature, as Ms affectionateness and gaiety of spirits. His wife, differ ently constituted, entirely appreciated Ms disposition, and learnt more and more to give him honour and love. There are, perhaps, some who may think Ellen would have done better had she remamed faithful to her first fancy. But few marriages wMch take place are equally the result of impassioned love on each side. In married life there are many degrees of happiness, varying from the more perfect, where there"], [317, "THE END. 309 is equal love on both sides, to the lowest, where there may indeed be said to be gnashing of teeth and bitter waihngs. It must be left to the reader to class this marriage of Mr. Vaughan and Ellen Raymond. Perhaps the following extracts from a letter, addressed to Mrs. Vaughan by Mrs. Cecil Mortimer, will best speak of the several personages of this tale who deserve some farewell notice. \" We all thmk, with one accord, that your claim to the poor little orphans is sacred. Only we Mortimers pray to be remembered, and that these children of poor Bessie and John may be allowed now and then to come among us, and so keep up an attachment for their father's people. They will indeed find a happy home with you and Mr. Vaughan ; and smce you are hitherto denied the blessing of children of your own, these little girls will be a subject of interest to you both I understand all the bitterness and aggravation of the trial, that you were absent when dear Bessie left us. But who could help it ? She seemed to be, if anything, in better health, when you went abroad. Her death was very sudden. That day was one of mtense ex citement to us all. To see Granville's success m the world so appreciated by his native town, was very gratifying. They received him publicly, with a speech, &c. The dmner was attended by every one in the town and the country near. When he rose to return thanks we were all in the balcony. He spoke well,"], [318, "310 UPS AND DOWNS. and his voice was so musical, I don't wonder at the enthusiastic applause which greeted him. Poor Bessie was there ; at this burst of clapping, she turned some what faint. We carried her out as we best could; but no sooner was she in her own room, than a fit of coughing came on ; then that frightful rush of blood ! \u2014 and, as you know, it was all over in one moment ! \" Strange mark to be set on Granville's triumph ! He w*as terribly shocked, poor fellow ! He really could scarcely stand at the funeral. I had no idea how much he cared for her till then. I wish I could say that we were thorougMy happy about him. He has attained an almost unprecedented success. The sale of his books is enormous. He is, we are told, at the head of literary society, asked everywhere, and feted in large towns as a pubhc benefactor. Yet amid all the flashes of brilliant but caustic humour which so mark his writings, is there not an under-tone of mournful sadness ? He paints life as such a ' sham,' such a hollow, rotten, vain thing ! And while all the world is laughing over his jokes, look at Mm at home ! So different from what I ever fancied he would be ! Bessie's death was followed by the lingering illness of his eldest chdd, little Ned, the father's darling ! His pride in him is great. Indeed, Granville is wonder fully fond and proud of his children, and, perhaps, rather obtrudes their excellences on the notice of others. This seems strange, for he was once so shrink ing and reserved about any matter connected with self. But the feehng must have existed, though hidden."], [319, "THE END. 311 Perhaps undue egotism may exist under the veil of shyness : it may either so remain hidden always, or burst forth under pressure of some shock, in broader characters, as the case may be. Excuse my prosing reflections. But for Granville, it seems to me as if better times were coming ; as if this success hi public, this praise accorded to his talents, followed by sorrow and anxiety, were to be the turning-point in his career. I look for yet another phase of character. His coun tenance is altered. There is at times less of that hard and reckless look which had of late been habitual, less often conies that mocking mood and sarcastic smile (shall we ever see that beautiful smile he once had again?) Now, it is often sad, but not sour, as during his last visit. I fancy too \u2014 and it is always well to hope the best for others \u2014 that there is a touch of more natural kmdness in his manners to his wife, lately so extra polite and painfully ceremonious. She has lost her good looks, dresses badly, and ' slaves ' early and late for her children ; but she never contrives to make them happy, in short \u2014 she spoils them, and shows her weakness and petty temper sadly in her mismanagement of them. I suspect he finds her more difficult to teach, more trying to his patience, than all the children. But from a word dropped by little Ned, I am inclined to trust that he does set himself in earnest even to tMs difficult and delicate task. We should hear nothing from Mm, but you know she is far from reserved or self-controlled. \" After all, perhaps, I judge more from what ' should be ' than what I see ; and I believe that even the"], [320, "312 UPS AND DOWNS. consequence of our own faults has a restorative power. \" For ourselves, we are all w*ell and as usual ; grand mamma of course very feeble and failing, but still enjoying some comfort, and often forgetting Granville's success as an author : but very fond of his children and affectionate to Lily. She always asks for you. We will see that your wishes are carried out. Trust to us, Bessie's grave shall not be forgotten ! \" \"But O blithe breeze! and O great seas ! Though ne'er \u2014 that earliest parting past \u2014 On your wide plain they join again, Together lead them home at last ! One port, methought, alike they sought \u2014 One purpose hold, where'er they fare : 0 bounding breeze, O rushing seas, At last \u2014 at last \u2014 unite them there! \" THE END.
