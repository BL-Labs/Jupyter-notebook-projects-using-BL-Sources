Mrs Digby found her cousin seated at a writing-table on a small sofa in her bed-room, with her head resting on her two hands, and a sheet of letter-paper before her. When Lucy entered she hastily wiped her eyes, and took up her pen. \" What are you about, my love ? \" said Mrs Digby, seating herself by her side, and putting one arm round her. \" I am writing to Mrs Tindal, to ask her if I can go to her for the rest of her visit.\" \" To Mrs Tindal ! Why, you are not think ing of leaving Thornwood without us ? \" VOL. II. 1"], [10, "2 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Yes, I must. I cannot stay here. Oh, Lucy,\" \u2014 and iioav the tears began to Aoav in earnest, \u2014 \" I will never again make plans of happiness. I thought I should be so happy here when Sir Hubert asked me to come, and now I am so very wretched.\" \" But, my dearest Susan, why should you be ? I grant that you have had a very un pleasant scene this evening, oAving to the persecution of that horrid man. But that is over now ; you Avill never hear another word of it.\" And then she delivered the messages of Marston and her husband. \" They are both very good,\" sobbed out Susan. \" My dear child,\" rejoined Mrs Digby, \" you are a little unjust to my husband. He is hasty and Avarm, no doubt, but he has a c\u0153ur d'or. He would go through fire and water to serve a friend, and, believe me, he looks upon you as such. He sincerely desires your hap piness ; only, like many others, he Avishes you to be happy in his way, not in your OAvn ; and Avhen he takes a thing into his head, he is a little obstinate about it, like another friend"], [11, "3 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. of mine. As for Sir Hubert, I need say no thing of him. You cannot doubt his good wishes.\" \" Ah, I thought so once, but latterly he is so changed, so cold and formal, and he always iioav calls me ' Miss Ashford.' \" \" Nay, my dear Susan, I am sure he took your defence Avarmly enough this evening, and I heard him call you Susan every time he mentioned you.\" \"That Avas only because he thought Mr Digby hard upon me ; and he is too noble, too generous not to give his protection to any one he thinks stands in need of it. He would have done the same for the meanest peasant on his estate. But you heard he did not contradict your husband when he said that, on this occasion, permission meant approba tion.\" \" Because he had just said he neither ap proved nor disapproved. In fact, he looked upon his permission as a mere formality.\" But Susan shook her head, and said she Avas certain he Avas disappointed and displeased at her refusal of Mr Ainslie."], [12, "4 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Oh, Lucy, he is offended Avith me ever since that unlucky day, and thought this a good opportunity of getting rid of me.\" \" What unlucky day do you mean ? \" asked Mrs Digby ; and then, by dint of examina tion, and cross-examination, elicited all the facts she was desirous of knoAving. It is needless to say that she drew a very differ ent conclusion from them from that at which her cousin had arrived, but this she had the sagacity to keep to herself. \" So you see I must go,\" said Susan ; \" I can no longer remain in a house where I am an umvelcome guest. Oh, if I could but go to India at once ; if I could but go to Harry, who Avould love me.\" \"My dear Susan,\" said Lucy, a little of fended, \" does that mean that you doubt my love ? \" \" Oh, no, no ! you cannot think it, Lucy. Your love will be the only thing to Avhich I shall look back Avith pleasure. And yet, there are times Avhen I doubt if it has done me good. It has raised me to a position, and brought me into society, for which I am not"], [13, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 5 fitted. How can Sir Hubert, accustomed to the society of highly-educated and accom plished women, look upon me in any other light than that of the poor servant-girl I Avas a few months ago.\" \" Well, my dear, it seems to me that you are tormenting yourself very needlessly. If you do but justice to yourself, in another year you Avill be qualified to take your proper place in any society into which you may chance to be throAvn. But now, about this letter to Mrs Tindal. It must be thrown into the fire.\" And thereupon a long discussion ensued, Avhich terminated in Susan's promising not to send the letter without her guardian's sanction, which she Avas to apply for on the morroAv ; but she steadily refused to come down-stairs again that night. When Lucy returned to the drawing-room, she said that Susan's head ached so that she was going to bed by her advice, and then she related as much of the conversation that had just taken place as she thought proper. Y\\ hen she mentioned Susan's wish to join Mrs Tin-"], [14, "6 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. dal, Digby, Avho, from certain observations he had made in the course of the last hour or two, no longer felt the same confidence in his friend's indifference, exclaimed, \" By Jove, the very best thing she could do ! It would be most unpleasant for Ainslie to run the risk of meeting her at every turn, after what has occurred.\" \" Damn Mr Ainslie ! \" burst out Sir Hu bert, Avith very unusual warmth. \" I really beg your pardon, Mrs Digby, but I am sick of his name.\" Mrs Digby's pardon was very readily granted. She quite entered into his feelings, and shared them, though, it is to be hoped, she would have expressed them in more decorous language. \" If Mr Ainslie,\" he continued, \" has any cause of dislike to the neighbour hood, it is for him to leave it ; but I cannot consent to have a guest of mine turned adrift, because Mr Ainslie chooses to fall in love Avith her, and does not meet with a return.\" \" Of course not,\" chimed in Lucy. \" If that Avere the case, you Avould soon find no Avomen \u2014 unmarried ones, at least \u2014 Avilling to risk such inhospitable treatment.\""], [15, "STR HUBERT MARSTON. 7 \" Still, if it is her OAvn wish,\" interposed Digby. \" I will speak to Susan myself to-morrow,\" said Marston. \" We will hold a lit de justice. in Mrs Digby's room, if she will permit us, after luncheon. Digby shall say whatever he has to say in favour of his view of the question ; I AA-ill plead the ancient rights of sanctuary enjoyed by the Priory ; and Mrs Digby shall be judge between us.\" But Digby had no inclination to try his cause before a tribunal so constituted. He declined. \" I will have nothing more to do with it,\" he said, \"and wash my hands of the Avhole concern. You are Susan's guardian, Lucy is her friend, and betAveen you I have no doubt her affairs will be very satisfactorily settled. I shall call on Ainslie, and do my best to soothe his mortification. For, though neither of you appear to consider his feelings, in my opinion he is much to be pitied.\" \" Well, I suppose he is,\" replied Marston ; \" but his allusion to India was most ungentle man-like, and on the whole, I incline to"], [16, "8 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. think that Susan has had an escape. HoAvever, you may tell him that I shall be very happy to see him here Avhenever he chooses to come.\" They soon after separated for the night, but it Avas long before any of the party found repose. As for Sir Hubert, he passed hour after hour tossing and tumbling in his bed, revolving in his mind thoughts of the most various complexion. His first feelings on hearing of Ainslie's discomfiture had been those of exultation, almost of triumph; but when, in the solitude of his OAvn room, he be gan to consider the question more calmly, he was forced to confess to himself that his un conscious rival's defeat brought him no nearer to the goal. He had escaped shipwreck upon one rock, but that Avas no guarantee for the future. With what eye Susan regarded him he was in profound ignorance. He had an idea that at one time she had viewed him with fear, if not dislike. True, since then, while she was at Mrs Tindal's, they had been upon much more intimate terms ; but there is a wide difference between drenching a man with cold water, and accepting him as a partner for life."], [17, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 9 Latterly7, too, there seemed to have been less cordiality existing betAveen them \u2014 she even wished to leave Thornwood. And if he were to propose to her, and be refused, her depart ure wras inevitable ; and jn all probability he Avould lose for ever the society of the being Avho had become dearer to him than anything on earth. He almost brought himself to be lieve that, if he could be sure of her remaining in England unmarried, rather than run such a risk, he could be content to continue on their present footing. But this, of course, AA-as out of the question. He must make her his, or be prepared to renounce her for ever. Forti fying himself by repeating various appropriate apothegms, such as \u2014 \" Faint heart never won fair lady,\" and the celebrated lines of the unfortunate Montrose, he came to the resolu tion to declare his love, and know his fate, before any other interlopers should make their appearance. With Marston, deliberately to form a resolution and abide by it, Avere one and the same thing. The only question now was, how it was to be carried out. At first he thought of consulting Mrs Digby, but he"], [18, "10 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. shrunk from taking any one into his confidence on such a subject. He Avas still endeavouring to find a way out of his difficulties, when the August sun shone into his room. Abandon ing all further thoughts of sleep, and hoping that the fresh morning air might help him to a solution of the enigma, he rose from his bed, dressed himself, and quietly let himself out of the house. The stables and gardens already showed signs of life, and on emerging into the park, he came suddenly upon the gamekeeper. \"Why, Spring,\" he said, \"you are up here earlier than usual to-day. Nothing wrong, I hope ?\" \"No, Sir Hubert, but it is my girl's wed ding-day, aud I thought I Avould just step up to see how the young pheasants was a-getting on, before I made myself ready for church.\" \" True, I had forgot it was to-day. But I shall make a point of being there. Miss Edith is to be one of the bridesmaids, I know.\" \" Yes, Sir Hubert; and she has given Hester the most beautiful silver teapot ever I seed. It's quite a pictur.\" Marston knew all about the teapot, inas-"], [19, "11 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. much as it had been presented at his sugges tion, and by his assistance. Miss Edith, by virtue of her intimacy with Mr Spring, had naturally become acquainted Avith all the ne gotiations for a matrimonial alliance between his eldest daughter, Hester, and Mr John Smith, the son and heir of the ThornAVood farm-bailiff, taking the greatest interest in all the arrangements connected therewith, and greatly lamenting that there Avere no difficul ties to be overcome. She had obtained her uncle's consent to officiate as bridesmaid, a consent willingly granted, for Spring Avas an old servant of the Marston family, and it was under his auspices that Master Hubert had killed his first partridge, and landed his first trout. \" Well, good-bye for the present, Spring,\" said Marston. \" Remember, all the wedding party sup at the Priory to-day. The more the merrier, and we will see if we cannot get up a dance afterwards. I know Avhat a good girl Hester is, and how highly Dr Snodgrass thinks of her. John Smith is a lucky felloAV to get such a wife.\""], [20, "12 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" God bless you, Sir Hubert, for all your kindness,\" said the keeper, his sun-burnt cheeks glowing Avith pleasure at this eulogium on his favourite daughter. \" But you are a real Marston, Sir Hubert, just as your brother and father was afore you. There never was a bad un of that breed yet, and it's my belief there never Avill be. And as for John Smith, he is a lucky man, though I say it, as shouldn't, but he deserves it.\" Marston had a question on the tip of his tongue for some time before he gave it utter ance, but, at last, out it came. \" Yes, he is a good, steady young man, and quite fit to take his father's place, Avhenever the old man goes. But he always seems to me so shy when I speak to him. Hoav did he find courage to ask Hester to marry him ?\" \" Oh, that came quite natural-like,\" said Spring, laughing. \" When they had kept company a bit, and he found that he loved the girl that well, he ups one evening before us all, bold as brass, and ' Hester,' says he, ' I love you better than any girl ever I set eyes on, and if you likes me Avell enough to be my Avife,"], [21, "13 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. I'll do my best to make you a good husband, with your parients' leave.' And that I calls behaving honest and like a man,\" added Mr Spring, slapping his thigh Avith immense energy. \"And then my girl, as hasn't no nonsense about her, she says \u2014 ' I'm agreeable, John, if so be father and mother hasn't any objection ;' which in course Ave hadn't.\" Well done, brave John Smith, honest John Smith ! So thought Marston, as he pursued his solitary walk. Yes, Spring was right ; that Avas the Avay for an honest man to deal with the Avoman he loved, and so Avould he deal with Susan. After luncheon he Avould ask her to take a walk Avith him, and then he Avould tell her how dearly she Avas beloved, and ask her to unite her fate to his. Greatly relieved by the resolution he had taken, after a long ramble he turned his steps homeAvards, and found Edith in the garden, instructing Susan in the mysteries and science of bee-husbandry; for there was no point of rustic economy to which that young lady did not by turns direct her attention. Her companion listened, or tried to listen, for"], [22, "14 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. her thoughts Avere evidently engaged on some other, and far less pleasing, topic. No longer the Susan of yesterday, her swollen eyelids and the black circles beneath her eyes spoke too plainly of tears and a sleepless night. \" My dear Susan,\" said Marston, taking her hand, which hung listlessly in his oavii, \" I am afraid you have not got rid of your headache yet.\" \" Her eyes filled at the kindness of his tone and words. She said something about a bad night, and that no doubt she should be better after breakfast. \" Well, then,\" he continued, drawing her arm within his, \" let us try the remedy Avith out delay. As soon as it is over Edith and I must attend Hester Spring's marriage, but I hope after luncheon you Avill be well enough to take a Avalk with me.\" The breakfast was hurried through, and Edith, most irreproachably got up for the occasion, seized upon her uncle's arm and al most dragged him off to the church, Avhich they reached before any of the bridal party made their appearance. Twrenty times she"], [23, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 15 expressed her conviction that something dis astrous had occurred to delay them. Twenty times Marston was obliged to sIioav her his watch to prove that, as yet, there was no reasonable cause for alarm. At length her impatience was gratified. While the church clock Avas still striking the hour appointed for the ceremony, all the Springs and Smiths in the parish, attended by all their belongings and friends \u2014 a goodly array \u2014 arrived, and Avalked up the aisle. Edith immediately joined them, and placed herself close to the bride, ready to prop her in the faint Avhich she believed to be indispensable upon such an occasion. Fortunately her services were not required, nor did she notice the omission, so much wras she absorbed by the service, every Avord of which she folloAved in her prayer-book, longing to correct Mr Ainslie whenever he skipped over any of the superfluous matter with which it is interlarded. At length it wras concluded, though not entirely to her satis faction ; and having kissed the newly-created Mrs John Smith, and signed her name as aa .tness in characters of most imposing magni-"], [24, "16 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. tude and distinctness, she rushed off home, to recount all she had witnessed to the sympa thizing ears of her maid, or any other listener she could find. Marston remained a few minutes after her, to speak to Mr Ainslie, and invite him to join their party that evening, and assist at the festivities with which the marriage was to be celebrated. No doubt it Avas rather an aAvkAvard task, but Marston felt that it was a compliment due to the officiating clergyman, and acquitted himself of it with great delicacy and good feeling. Ainslie, however, was not to be won by such blandishments. He had evidently not recovered his equanimity, and replied, rather sulkily, that he Avas in no humour for merry-making, and that he must remain at home, as Digby had sent him word that he meant to call upon him in the course of the morning. In the mean time Edith had reached the Priory, and great was her delight when, on stepping into the morning room through the open window, she found Susan endeavouring to occupy herself at the piano. She lost no time in pouncing on her victim. \"Oh, Susan,\""], [25, "17 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. she cried, \" the most beautiful wedding I ever saAv\" \u2014 Avell it might be, as it was her first and only one. \" Everybody behaved so well, only- Mr Ainslie looked so grumpy. I wonder how you can like him. Were you ever at a Avedding ? \" \" No \u2014 yes, once,\" said Susan, as she re membered with a shudder her father's ill-fated marriage. \" But I do not remember much about it.\" Edith jumped at the opening thus offered her. \" Oh, I will tell you all about it. I will do it for you. These chairs shall be the com munion-rails, and you shall be Hester, and I Avill do Mr Ainslie. Oh, what shall we do for John Smith ? Wait a minute, and I will get one of Hubert's sticks and put his hat on it, and that will do very well, for it's only make believe you knoAV.\" But at that moment she saw her uncle crossing the lawn. Rushing to the window, she cried out, \" Oh, Hubert, Hubert, do come here ; we Avant you so very much.\" \" Well, Pussy,\" said Marston, stepping into the room, \" Avhat can I do for you ? \" VOL. II. 2"], [26, "18 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \"I am showing Susan how people are married. I am Mr Ainslie, and she is Hester, and you must be John Smith.\" Marston entered upon the part of Mr John Smith with great alacrity. As for Susan, she took the place assigned her with a listless apathy, which shoAved that her thoughts were far away. She stood like one in a dream, utterly unconscious of Avhat wras going on around her. Mr Ainslie's representative pro ceeded with the service in what Avas intended to be a very impressive manner, and dictated to each the words set down for them, Marston repeating them after her Avith great fervour, and Susan mechanically. \" Oh, where is a ring ? \" exclaimed the parsoness ; \" Ave must have a ring. Hubert, please give me one of yours.\" He drew off a plain gold ring which he Avore constantly on his little finger, and then at the proper time placed it on the fourth finger of Susan's left hand, saying, at the same time, \" With this ring I thee Aved,\" &c. Just then the bell rang for the servants' dinner. \"Oh, how tiresome,\" said Miss Edith, \"I"], [27, "19 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. promised my maid I would come up to take off my things before she Avent doAvn to dinner. We must finish it some other time.\" And with these Avords she ran out of the room. At the same moment, whether it Avas the noise Edith made in her exit, or from what ever cause, Susan returned to a perception of the scene in Avhich she had been playing a part, Avhile, like one awrakened from a trance, every word that had been addressed to her, every word she had uttered, struck upon her ears Avith terrible distinctness and precision. Turning deadly pale, and with something like a sob, she sunk into a chair, and endea voured, but in vain, to draAv Sir Hubert's ring from her finger. \" Susan, Susan,\" exclaimed Marston, lay ing his hand on hers, \" keep it, I entreat of you, if you have the slightest regard for me. What to you has been merely a matter of jest, has been to me real earnest. Every vow to love, to honour, to comfort you, I spoke with deliberate sincerity of heart and soul. For I love you, Susan ; I love you better than any thing this world can give, better than life*"], [28, "20 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. far better than words can express. This rings wras my mother's wedding-ring. If you can not give me your love, keep it at least for friendship's sake.\" \" Love me, Sir Hubert ; you ! Oh no, it cannot be ! \" He knelt doAvn beside her. \" Susan, I have never told an untruth. Will you not believe me when I tell you, that you and you only are the object of my devoted, my passionate love ? Will you not believe me when I tell you, that the dearest Avish of my heart is to call you my Avife ? \" \" Your wife ! Oh no, you cannot wish me to be your wife ; me, so unw-orthy ! \" \" Unworthy ! Ah Susan, if we were both weighed in the balance, I much fear it would be\u2014 not you, but I, aaIio would be found wanting.\" Susan hitherto had struggled successfully against her emotion, but now she gave way, and burst into tears. \" Oh, Susan,\" have I said anything to distress you?\" said Marston. \"If I have,"], [29, "21 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. believe me, I Avould have cut my tongue off rather than have offended you.\" \" No, no,\" she sobbed out, \" it is not that ; but I did not think there had been such hap piness in store for me on earth.\" \" You do love me a little, then, my OAvn darling? \" \" Love you ! \" she exclaimed, putting both her hands on his shoulders, and looking into his eyes ; \" Love you ! From the first mo ment, when I lay helpless in your arms on that horrid night, I have had no thought but for you. But, ah me, I should not tell you this. Hoav you must despise me for my weakness ! \" \" Despise you ! \" he cried, \" when every word you utter gives you a fresh claim to my devoted love ! \" Then, perhaps, calling to mind that deeds are more convincing than Avords, he had recourse to a process invented, pro bably, by Adam, and Avhich is still very generally supposed by his descendants to be singularly efficacious in removing doubts in -similar cases. \" But come into the garden,"], [30, "22 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. dearest. The men are gone to their dinners, and we shall be quite alone.\" She complied, and then, being in an expansive mood, he ex plained how he 'had been jealous of the mys terious somebody for whom the floAvers Avere destined at Acton ; and then, what a sharp attack of the same disease he had lately un dergone on the Rev. Mr Ainslie's account, \" Can you ever forgive me, my own love, for the brutal way in Avhich I behaved to you two clays ago ? \" Perhaps Susan might have capped his re cital with some experiences of her OAvn, had she thought proper ; but though she coloured a little at some recollections, she did not think it necessary to imitate her lover's can dour. \" And now,\" pursued Marston, \" let us go at once and tell cousin Lucy. We will take counsel with her as to our next steps. Have you any idea Avhere she is to be found ? \" \" In her OAvn sitting-room, I believe. She had letters to Avrite. But is it really neces sary to tell any one just yet ? \" She had an instinctive dread of Digby."], [31, "23 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Yes, the Digbys, I think. He is my best friend, as she is yours. They would have a just cause of complaint if left in ignor ance. As for letting anybody else into the secret at present, Ave will think about it.\" They found Mrs Digby, as Susan had pre dicted, in her oavii room, Avith half-a-dozen letters before her. \" Well, Mrs Digby,\" said Marston, \" I have been lecturing this young lady, and I think that she has given up all thoughts of writing to Mrs Tindal.\" But Susan'had darted past him, and kissing her cousin, found means of whispering into her ear, \" Lucy, Lucy, he loves me.\" To Avhich Lucy responded, \" You silly child, I could have told you that long ago.\" \" The fact is,\" continued Marston, \" Susan feels that she is growing old, and is tired of a single life ; and as I have long felt the same thing, we have agreed to cast in our lots to gether. In short, Susan has promised to be my wife, or, indeed, I might say she is my"], [32, "24 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Avife already, for we have just been bound so firmly together, that we have neither strength nor inclination to burst our fetters.\" And then he related Avhat he called their Gretna Green marriage. Mrs Digby was enchanted at this realiza tion of her plans, but she thought it more dignified to show no signs of exultation. As suming the tone of a matron of forty, she replied, \" Well, good people, I am glad you know your own minds, and have come to an un derstanding at last. It Avill be much plea santer for the lookers-on than the hot and cold fits of the last few weeks.\" \" But, cousin Lucy,\" said Marston, \" will you not Avish us joy ? \" \" Most heartily, most cordially, most sin cerely. It has long been my dearest hope to see you two married, for I think no two people were ever better suited to each other ; and I prophesy a long career of happiness for you. And now, tell me what are your plans ? \" \" That is exactly Avhat we want to discuss"], [33, "25 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. with you. I should say Ave might have every thing ready in a month or six weeks.\" \" Oh, no, Sir Hubert,\" said Susan, \" not till the year of mourning for my poor father is out. I should like to remain Avith Mrs Tin dal a little longer.\" \" In the first place, Miss Ashford, I beg you to understand once for all, that I will never even listen to you Avhen you address me so formally ; I hope I am Hubert for you noAv. As for Avhat you say about waiting till your mourning is over, it shoAvs too much good feeling for me to argue against it ; but, with regard to Mrs Tindal \" \"No, Sir Hubert,\" interposed Mrs Digby, \" Susan is right, and shows her good sense. Let her finish her year with Mrs Tindal. It -will be of incalculable advantage to her, and you will neither of you regret it. Susan is quite young enough to wait a year.\" \" Yes, but I am not.\" \" Poor old gentleman ! But, notAvithstand ing your advanced age, I strongly advise Susan not to think of marriage till the spring ; and, in the mean time, to keep your engagement a"], [34, "26 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. secret from every one. It will prevent a great deal of idle gossip and speculation. I suppose, however, you will not think it necessary to keep John in the dark ? \" \" Certainly not,\" replied Sir Hubert. \" Shall I tell him, or will you ? \" \" Whoever sees him first ; but, in all pro bability, it will fall to my lot. And now, let us go down-stairs. I do not knoAv what you may be, but I am famished.\" After luncheon, Edith tried hard, but in vain, to persuade her half-married pair to com plete the ceremony. Marston greatly pre ferred taking Susan out for a quiet drive in the phaeton ; Edith shouting after them as they drove off, \" Susan, mind you make Hubert give you the reins. I always do.\""], [35, "27 CHAPTER II. Mrs Digby had offered to communicate to her husband the news of Susan's engagement; but it Avas with considerable misgivings as to the manner in which it Avould be received. And in fact she had some reason for apprehen sion, for Digby did not return in the most amiable frame of mind. Mr Ainslie still chose to consider himself as a very ill-used man, and the expressions which he applied to all concerned \u2014 Susan, Sir Hubert, and by implica tion his friend Digbyhimself, \u2014 Avere not always of the most refined or delicate nature. Digby had done his best to soothe him, but, Avhen he found his efforts in vain, he began to chafe iiiAvardly, and ended by showing it outwardly."], [36, "28 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Although on the preceding evening he had taken Susan so severely to task, he noAV thought it his duty to defend her against Avhat he believed to be unjust imputations, and he did so with spirit. He maintained her right to exercise her oavii judgment in a matter so nearly affecting her own happiness, and, provoked by Ainslie's sarcastic laugh, hinted that the reverend gentleman would have done better to have made a little more sure of his ground, before committing himself so completely. \" I'll tell you Avhat it is, Digby,\" said Mr Ainslie, \"she is a thorough-paced flirt, if ever there was one in this world.\" \" Nonsense, Ainslie, she is nothing of the sort,\" replied Digby, a little redder than usual. \" During the time I have knoAvn her I have never seen the slightest approach to levity in her conduct. On the contrary, she is shy and retiring to a fault. Marston has more than once complained of her extreme dif fidence, and I cannot say that I ever noticed any particular encouragement that you received from her.\""], [37, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 29 \"Oh, you do not know Avhat passed between us when we Avere alone. And as for Sir Hubert, he has his oavii vieAVs, no doubt. I only hope they may be as honourable as mine.\" This attack on his friend was more than Digby could bear, and he broke out. \" If,\" he said, \"you took advantage of the confidence reposed in you by Miss Ashford's guardian and friends to say or to do anything, that you would not have said or done before us all, I can only say that you are a very unfit person to be trusted alone with a young lady; but I feel too certain of Susan's good principles to believe that she Avould have exposed herself to anything of the sort a second time. Sir Hubert Marston has been my intimate friend for many years, and I know him to be as incapable of a dishonourable action as I am myself. I shall noAV take my leave, quite reconciled to the decision at Avhich Miss Ash ford has arrived. I OAvn I thought her pre cipitate, but I am noAV convinced that she has acted Avell and Avisely for her OAvn happiness. I Avish you good-morning, Sir.\""], [38, "30 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. He left the house furious with Mr Ainslie for the imputations he had thrown out against Susan, which the whole tenour of her conduct contradicted, and Avhich he very justly set down as the malicious inventions of an angry man. He was still more furious at the inten tions imputed to Marston ; and most furious Avith himself for having been induced to in troduce Mr Ainslie, Avith whom his acquaint ance had always been of a very slight nature, and of whom he had completely lost sight of late years, as his friend. And, unfortunately for Susan, he could not forget that she Avas the cause, the very innocent cause, of the pre dicament into which he had been betrayed. \" Well, John,\" said his wife, as he entered her room, \"how did you leave your friend Mr Ainslie ? \" \" Now, Lucy, pray do not call a man my friend, whom you knoAv to be only a college acquaintance. I am sure you have tAvitted me Avith it often enough.\" This Avas strictly true. \"No, John, not tAvitted \u2014 such a horrid word \u2014 just hinted at it now and then, when no-"], [39, "31 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. body was by ; but I have no wish to mention his name again. Now sit doAvn, like a good dear, and I Avill tell you a piece of news.\" \"Hubert and Susan are engaged, of course,\" he growled out. \" They are ; but how could you guess it ?

In fact, his thoughts had been all tending that way since he left the rectory. \" Then all I can say is, that I am very sorry to hear it,\" he said. \" John, dear John, do not be cross. We are all so happy.\" \" My dear Lucy, without being cross I may say that I am very sorry for it ; and I will tell yrou my reasons. Marston has great energy and more talent than any one \u2014 himself included \u2014 probably gives him credit for.

Susan has none of these, and moreover I greatly doubt their being as well suited to each other as you seem to imagine.

With regard to Susan herself I have not a Avoid to say against her.

When to this I add innate good principle, right feeling, and strong affections, I think even you must admit that I am quite ready to do her justice. She is young enough to correct her defects, if she falls into the hands of one able and willing to assist her. But I much doubt that being the case here. Hubert must be very much in love indeed to overlook all the disadvantages of such a marriage, for he has his share of family pride ; for a year or two he will think her perfection, and when he aAvakes from his dream, it will probably be too late. She ought, as I said yesterday, to marry some sensible man, avIio will see her as she is, an imperfect Avoman, and not an angel. Then there would be a fair chance for her.\" \" In short, John, she ought to follow my example.\" \" Lucy, Lucy, I thought you had forgiven me that unlucky speech.

And iioav, having told you all I feel on one part of the question, I will tell you wdiat I feel on another. I cannot pretend to be satisfied with the denouement, but I wTill confess that it is a relief to me that this matter is set at rest ; for there is no denying that for the last few months it has been a source, I will not say of dissension, but of disagreement, be tween us. Our first, and I hope our last. Did not your conscience prick you a little for acting in opposition to my wishes ? \" \" Oh. John, recollect you gave me free leave to do my worst.\" Digby Avas as good as his word. He still thought it a bad job, but resolved to make the"], [43, "35 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. best of it ; and his Avhispered congratulations to Susan, as he handed her out of the carriage on her return home, were so warm and so evidently sincere, that they quite effaced all her previous impressions of his dislike. She had had so feAv opportunities of making friends, that it Avas with heart-felt satisfaction that she now added the husband of the cousin, avIio had shoAvn her such steady affection, to the number. After an early dinner they all adjourned to the hall, which in the good old days had been \"the refectory of the monks, but which now was prepared for the dance intended to cele brate the nuptials of Miss Spring and Mr J. Smith. Much would those holy men have been scandalized, could they have Avitnessed the present scene. Sir Hubert, as in duty bound, opened the ball Avith the bride, while to the bridegroom was allotted no less a per sonage than Miss Edith Wilmington. Susan looked on for a few minutes with a sigh of something like em^y. Since the days in which she used to Avaltz with her brother Harry to the music of a street organ, she had never had an opportunity of joining in this, to all ap-"], [44, "36 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. pearance, the most fascinating of all the plea sures of youth. To her great surprise Digby came up to her, and asked her to join the dancers. She Avas dying to accept, but her total ignorance of the figure \u2014 the probability that she Avould produce confusion, and perhaps the dread of exposing herself to ridicule by her blunders, induced her to decline. As she had no false shame, she frankly told him the cause of her refusal ; but Mrs Digby, who for reasons of her own preferred sitting still, Avould not allow her husband to accept her excuses. \" My dear Susan,\" she said, \" this is only an English country dance, the easiest thing in the world, and John is a capital dancer, and will carry you through it triumphantly. Do, dear,\" she Avhispered, \"if only to prove that you have forgiven him.\" Thus adjured, Susan stood up ; but before taking her partner's arm, she said, \"Do you think, Mr Digby, that he will like it?\" \" A very proper question ; I will ascertain in a minute.\""], [45, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 37 He was not long absent, and on his return, announced that Sir Hubert not only approved, but had commissioned him to engage her as his partner for the next dance. From this time all was pure unadulterated happiness, and Susan was surprised to find how easily she overcame difficulties Avliich had appeared insurmountable. The festivities Avere brought to a conclusion by a supper ; on the announcement of which, Sir Hubert and his party prepared to retire, in order to leave the other guests more at their ease. Previous to doing so, hoAvever, he filled a glass of Avine, and drank to the health of the neAv-married couple. Mr John Smith returned thanks, and, amidst the cheers of all present, expressed a hope that, \u2022before long, Sir Hubert himself Avould enjoy the happiness he had just wished them. \" A Avish in which I most cordially join,\" exclaimed a young man, avIio had just entered \u25a0the hall, unobserved. \" Deptford ! \" exclaimed Marston, hastily turning round. \" What good chance brings you here to-night ? \" \" A truant disposition, good my Lord ! The"], [46, "38 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. fact is, the grouse are getting shy \u2014 small blame to them \u2014 and as Ave are so close on the first of September, I thought I might as well come and help you with the partridges. But will you not introduce me to your friends ? \" During the last few months Marston had seen a great deal of his nepheAV, and every day became more attached to him. With all his apparent frivolity, Lord Deptford had plenty of good sense Avhen he chose to make use of it. Under another system of education, he Avould probably have been distinguished for something more than his proficiency in athletic exercises and field sports ; accomplishments, hoAvever, Avhich did him no disservice in the eyes of so thorough a sportsman as Marston. He may be said to have been spoiled by his mother from his cradle, partly, because he Avas in truth her favourite child, and partly, from more interested motives \u2014 for her jointure was a small one, and she looked forward to the golden era of his coming of age for securing a permanent addition to her income. As this period approached, not content Avith throwing out occasional hints of her hopes and expecta-"], [47, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 39 tions, which were perfectly intelligible, she employed a confidential friend to expatiate on the same subject, and to lecture him on the duties of sons to ill-jointured mothers. It certainly was not a judicious proceeding with a man who Avas not particularly fond of advice or interference of any sort. The unlucky en voy was snubbed for her pains ; but Lord Deptford took an early opportunity of quieting his mother's anxiety. \" I shall not be a rich man,\" he said, \" but you may depend upon my doing everything in my power to make you and my sisters perfectly comfortable, before I think of myself. I only wish, if you doubted my affection, that you had spoken to me openly yourself, instead of setting that horrid old cat Charlotte Campbell at me. I do so hate -everything that looks underhand.\" But with his uncle there was nothing under hand. On the contrary, there was something so frank and open in Sir Hubert's manner, that it compelled a return, and in his company Lord Deptford even went the length of drop ping all his affectations of language and man-"], [48, "40 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. ner. He came out in his true, natural character of a fine, open-hearted young man, full of fun and spirit, and was the first to laugh at his assumption of fashionable indifference, when he found himself in an atmosphere less conge nial to it. Meeting frequently, not as uncle and nephew, but on terms of the most unreserved intimacy, a Avarm friendship sprung up be tween the two, resembling the affection exist ing, or which ought to exist, between an elder and a younger brother. It was with undisguised pleasure that Mar ston greeted the new comer ; though, perhaps, there was a shade of embarrassment, as he proceeded to comply with his request. \"My dear Mrs Digby,\" he said, \"will you alloAv me to present to you my nephew, Lord Deptford, not altogether an unfavourable spe cimen of the rising generation, though he takes a sort of perverse pleasure in making himself out to be worse than he really is. Miss Ash ford, Lord Deptford. 1 think you have met Digby in London.\" \" A most scandalous imputation, I assure you, Mrs Digby. I expect, before Ave part,"], [49, "41 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. that you and Miss Ashford will sign my cer tificate as a model man. Ah, Edith, are you there ? Give me a kiss.\" He offered his arm to Mrs Digby as they were leaving the hall ; Sir Hubert followed AA'ith Susan ; Digby bringing up the rear with Edith, avIio dilated upon her extreme surprise at her brother's arrival, mixed with regrets that he had not come in time to dance with her. \" My oavii Susan,\" said Marston, before they reached the drawing-room, \" I am rather in a fix, and I Avant you to help me out of it. Deptford and I live on terms of such intimacy, that I do not quite like keeping our engage ment a secret from him. Have you any ob jection to my telling him of it ?

But, oh, Hu bert, if he should not like it, and should try to make you love me less.\" \" My own darling, do you then think so slightingly of my love as to suppose that it is in the power of the Avhole Avorld to shake it ? Believe me, it is yours and yours only, entirely,"], [50, "42 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. and for ever. It may increase, though of that I doubt the possibility, but nothing can ever diminish it. However, as far as regards Dept ford, you may set your mind at ease. He will be the first to wish -us joy. In fact, poor felloAv, it is but fair to give him warning, for fear he should fall in love with you himself.\" And certain it is that his Lordship did re gard her with very evident admiration. \"And now, tell me,\" he said, when they Avere all again assembled in the draAving-room, \" Avhat is the meaning of all this merry-mak ing. Hardly to celebrate' my arrival ; in the first place, because you knew nothing of it, and in the next, because you would not have begun and finished without me.\" \" It is to celebrate the nuptials of your old friend, Miss Spring, and Mr John Smith,\" replied his uncle. \" So that has come off at last ! I am heart ily glad of it, though I wish I had arrived an hour or two ago, that I might have had my share of the fun.

That is delightful ; for, you must know, one of my many merits is that of being the best dancing-master of the age. It is incredible the number of young ladies Avho owe their success in life to me.

Besides, Avaltzing is like sAvim ming \u2014 Avhen once you have learned it, you can never forget it. I assure you the experi ence of your youth will be of the greatest use to you now in your old age.\" \" Do, Susan,\" said Mrs Digby, rising to place herself at the piano-forte. Susan looked at Marston, and receiving from him a nod of assent, stood up, and soon found that Lord Deptford's assertion Avas cor rect.

At length, Miss Edith received a summons to retire, which she reluctantly obeyed, loudly declaring that she had never felt less sleepy in her life, and Mrs Digby was released from her duties; but not before Marston had prevailed upon Lord Deptford to relinquish his partner to him for a few turns. Sir Hubert had, I am grieved to say, the never-sufficiently-to-be-condemned practice of smoking a cigar or tAvo in his oavii room before going to bed ; and in this pursuit he Avas ahvays joined by Digby, avIio thus basely abused his Avife's indulgence.

We say, ' the Invention of the Cross.' \" \" Miss Ashford is Mrs Digby's cousin, and my ward.\" \" Your ward ! I did not knoAv you had one. I shall curry favour with the guardian, I promise you. But hoAv did it come to pass ?\" \" In the simplest way in the Avorld,\" inter posed Digby. \" Her father died a few months ago. My father-in-law is one of her guard ians, and as we were at a loss for a second, Marston very good-naturedly undertook the office.\" \"Just like him, I Avas going to say; but Miss Ashford's beauty destroys all his merit.\" \" Can you keep a secret, Deptford? \" asked Marston. \" A real secret.\" \"Try me.\""], [54, "46 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Well then, my ward in a feAv months -will be your aunt. We are engaged; so mind you treat her Avith becoming respect.\" \" You don't say so ! \" exclaimed Deptford, seizing hold of his uncle's hand. \" By Jove, I am delighted \u2014 not only on account of your marriage, but for the very proper consideration you have shown for my feelings, in providing me with so charming an aunt. I think my sisters tolerably good-looking, but they are not to be named in the same day with Aunt Susan.\" \"But remember, Deptford, as yet it is a profound secret. Susan allowed me to tell you, on my answering for your discretion. With the exception of my friend Digby and his wife, not a soul knows it. Be especially careful before that little monkey Edith, who is as sharp as a needle.\" \" All right, Hubert. I am too grateful to Miss Ashford for the exception she has alloAved you to make in my favour, not to obey her wishes in every particular. And noAV tell me all Iioav and about it.\" Lord Deptford took the earliest opportunity of speaking to Susan on the following day. \" I"], [55, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 47 can congratulate you, Miss Ashford,\" he said, \" with a very safe conscience, for no one knows better than myself Iioav worthy Hubert is to be loved. I think he is the only man from Avhoni I could bear to take advice. One sees at once that it is not from the pleasure of lecturing, or a Avish to prove his own superior wisdom, that he gives it, but from the real interest that he takes in one ; and it is always couched in terms of hearty, cordial affection. I always go to him when I am in a scrape. There is no one in the AATorld for whom I feel a more sincere attachment ; there is no one in the world Avho better deserves it. Believe me, there are not two Huberts to be found upon earth.\" Susan candidly confessed that she did not believe there Avere, and the noble lord con tinued \u2014 \"And I congratulate him, too, for I am sore you are just the person to suit him, and make him happy.

I was so afraid that you would think me, as indeed I am, unworthy to be Sir Hubert's choice. One thing, and one thing only, I can promise \u2014 and that is, to make his happiness the study of my life.\" \" I am sure you will, and I am also sure that you will succeed. Hubert is made for domestic life. I do not say that he will be contented with that alone, for he has strong aspirations for distinction and fame, as Avhat man deserving of the name has not, but his happiness will be found in the affections of his home.\" Susan did not quite like the idea of having even a grateful country her rival for Sir Hu bert's attentions, but she said nothing ; and Lord Deptford pursued : \"And now having congratulated you and my uncle, you must permit me to congratulate"], [57, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 49 myself. I have always been tormented by the idea, that Avhenever Hubert conferred an aunt upon me, it would be some one avIio would not tolerate a good-for-nothing felloAV like me for a moment, but you look so good-natured, that I am sure you will extend your indul gence to a nephew, who, if he is always offend ing, is always penitent for five minutes at least.\" Susan laughed, and assured him that he might safely reckon on her indulgence, when ever he felt that he stood in need of it. \" Rely upon it,\" she said, \" I shall never forget the kindness and good-wall shown me by the first member of Hubert's family with Avhom I have become acquainted.\" i VOL. II."], [58, "50 CHAPTER III. Three weeks of happiness, unalloyed, ex cept by the thought that they would be fol lowed by months of separation, passed rapidly away. It was no easy task to avoid Miss Edith's powers of observation, but even that was happily accomplished, in great part by the assistance of Lord Deptford. It is true that one clay at dessert she exclaimed, \" Oh ! Susan, I declare you have still got Hubert's ring on your finger.\" But her brother stepped in to the rescue. \" Don't you know, Edith, that a gentleman can never take back wdiat he has once given?\" \" Yes, but she ought not to wear it on that finger. It looks as if she were really married.\""], [59, "51 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Susan in great discomposure tried to get the ring off, but in vain, and Sir Hubert said, \" Let it be for the present, Susan, we will see what is to be done with it by-and-by.\" The result was, that the ring was sent up to London, and so artfully encased in another of emeralds and diamonds, that it could safely be worn by the owner on any finger she pleased, Avithout fear of detection. At length, Digby announced that it was time for him to return to London, taking with him, of course, his wife and her cousin. Marston more than once pressed them to remain, at least till his sister and nieces arrived, that he might present Susan to them as his affianced Avife ; but this she declined, and in her refusal was supported by the Digbys, and still more strongly by Lord Deptford. \" I knoAv my mother so well,\" he said upon one occasion to his uncle, \" that I am quite sure the idea of your marrying at all will greatly discompose her, and may lead to un pleasant scenes.

It looks so like deception.\" Lord Deptford laughed, and turned to Susan. \" Pray, Miss Ashford, admire this ex cess of vanity. He is afraid that some of his young lady guests should fall in love Avith him. But tranquillises vous ; there is not the slight est necessity for you to flirt Avith them, or make love to them. I will sacrifice myself, and flirt for both, and even make love, if oc casion requires.

It could not be jealousy -."], [61, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 53 of that she Avas certain. She would as soon think of doubting her oaa-11 truth and constancy as Hubert's. Still, it Avould have pleased her better, if he had not been obliged to expose himself to so much temptation. She almost Avished, after all, that their engagement were declared, as a sort of warning that no one should presume to trespass on her manor ; but then she recalled with affright some story Lucy had told her of a school-fellow of her oaatii, whose great delight, since she had come to Avoman's estate, w^as to lay traps for the unwary lovers of her friends, and seduce them from their allegiance. Men are so weak, and Avomen are so unprincipled !

Other men might be AAreak; but Hubert \u2014 her Hubert\u2014 was as superior to other men as the splendour of the sun at noon is to the twinkling of the midnight star.

Sir Hub'ert accompanied them to the station. The last words were spoken \u2014 proba bly, Marston had availed himself of the few minutes, during wdiich he and Susan had found|theniselves alone in the breakfast room, for a tenderer fareAvell \u2014 the bell rang, the Avhistle shrieked, and, almost before Susan knew that her lover's hand was AvithdraAvn from her grasp, she was on her Avay to London. The journey was a silent one, on her part at least. That night she slept at Kensington, and on the folloAving day returned to Acton, Avhere Mrs Tindal had already been establish ed for some days. In the course of the Aveek, Mrs Digby paid"], [65, "57 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. her a visit, fraught with two pieces of intelli gence ; one of which Avas a source of real sor row to her cousin, while the other only excited her disgust. Before Susan left Thornwood, she obtained from Sir Hubert a promise that he would alloAv her to adopt her half-sister, provided Mrs Ashford Avas willing to give her up altogether, a concession, which a kno\\A 'ledge of that worthy lady's character induced them to think Avould be obtained Avithout much dif ficulty. It must be confessed that this pro mise Marston had given rather reluctantly. Perhaps he thought that hereafter such an ar rangement might be productive of considerable inconvenience, but he could not resist Susan's entreaties to him, to assist her in rescuing the child from the demoralizing influence of such a mother. Still he had fenced round his con sent Avith various stipulations. Miss Rose Ashford Avas not to be received as an acknow ledged member of his family. She Avas to be placed under the care of some respectable Avoman, and, at a proper age, sent to school. By the time she was sixteen or seventeen they AA-ould settle what to do with her next. Susan,"], [66, "58 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. no doubt, would have liked to have had her sister about her, and taken entire charge of her, and it is much to her credit, that she not only submitted cheerfully to Marston's decision, but acknoAvledged the justice of the arguments by which he enforced it. Digby undertook to make the necessary inquiries, and the result of them Avas that the child had been dead about tAvo months. This was the cause of Susan's grief. Digby also ascertained that a month after the death of her daughter, seven months after that of her husband, Mrs Ashford had again sacrificed at the altar of Hymen, and had blessed Avith her hand a pawnbroker of the name of Allen, with whom she Avas liv ing in the shady boAvers of Bermondsey ; this it was Avhich excited Susan's disgust. Time passed more rapidly than she had ex pected. She applied herself with redoubled ardour to her studies ; and, having exhausted good Mrs Tindal's rather superficial stock of learning, had recourse, by Marston's advice, to the best masters in those branches of educa tion, Avhich are usually deemed indispensable adjuncts to a young lady's stock in trade."], [67, "59 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Nor had she any reason to complain of her lover's remissness. Twice a-week, regularly, the postman stopped at Mrs Tindal's door to deliver a letter from ThoniAvood ; and every fortnight or three Aveeks Marston framed some excuse for leaving his guests for a day, under the able supervision of Lady Deptford and her son, to warm himself, as he Avas pleased poet ically to express himself, in the sunshine of Susan's presence. Happy, but too-fleeting, moments ; to Avhich, in after times, Susan's memory often reverted. Lady Deptford, who was naturally of an inquiring turn of mind, had put question upon question as to Avho this Susan Ashford was, about Avhom Edith was perpetually rav ing. Her brother told her simply that she was his ward, the sister of a friend of his now in India, and a cousin of Mrs Digby, whom he had invited to accompany that lady on her visit to Thornwood; but Lord Deptford seemed to take a perverse pleasure in mystifying her. He cried up Susan to the skies ; praising her beauty, her singing, her dancing, her figure, in the most extravagant terms \u2014 going"], [68, "60 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. even the length of hinting, that as soon as he was of age, it was his intention to ask her to be Lady Deptford, provided she was not other- AA'ise disposed of in the mean time. His sisters laughed at him ; but his mother, if not actually alarmed, began to lose her usual composure at the constant recurrence of the name. Edith, too, added fuel to the flame by the raptures in which she spoke of her friend Susan. \" Oh, mamma, you should have seen her when Deptford Avas teaching her to waltz. She had not danced for such a long time, and yet she did it nearly as well as I and Hu bert.\" But Lady Deptford's agitation reached its climax, Avhen her son, with mischievous osten tation, allowed her to see the address of a letter in his handAATiting, to \" Miss Ashford, care of John Digby, Esq., &c,\" before throw ing it into the letter-box. She sought out Marston, and confided her fears to him. \" He has actually been writing to that ward of yours.\" Hubert could hardly forbear smiling, for the letter had not only been written in his"], [69, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 61 study, but had been submitted to his inspec tion. He did his best to reassure her ; tell ing her that Deptford Avas always fond of a flirtation, \u2014 that certainly, in the present case, he had not paid Miss Ashford half the atten tions that he had paid to a dozen others ; and finally, that if he, Marston, had seen anything at all indicating serious attentions, he Avould have been the first to stop it, as he could never sanction a marriage between his nephew and his Avard. \" Of course not,\" said Lady Deptford, some- Avhat consoled ; \" of course not. Nobody knows better than yourself that, when Dept ford marries, it must be somebody with money, and I suppose Miss Ashford is not rich ? \" \" Oh, dear, no. Some five thousand pounds. As you say, such a marriage for him is quite out of the question. If you take my advice, you Avill let the matter drop. He only per severes in it from a spirit of contradiction.\" \"But this letter. What can he have to write to her about ? \" \"Some commission she gave him; I am not quite sure what. But to prove to you"], [70, "62 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. how little he is in earnest, he forgot all about it till to-day, Avhen he asked me for her direction.\" And, in fact, if Lady Deptford could have read the letter, all uneasiness would have van ished from her mind ; or, at least, Avould have taken another direction. Digby gave it to his Avife, who Avas just starting for Acton to bring her cousin back with her. As soon as she had read it, Susan gave it to Mrs Digby, and told her to read it out, which she immediately proceeded to do. \" My dear Aunt by anticipation,\" thus it began. \" It is high time that I should give you some account of the way in which I have discharged the duty I took upon myself, of keeping Hubert in the paths of morality and virtue ; and I am happy to say, that hitherto I have been tolerably successful. If you knew at what a sacrifice of myself, you would pity me. But upon this topic I will not enlarge. Suffice it to say, that besides my mother and sisters, there are four other ladies staying in the house, and by the most incredible exer tions I have succeeded in concentrating the"], [71, "63 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. affections of all four upon myself. Hoav it is all to end I have not the slightest idea. No wonder Hubert is perpetually rushing up to London for consolation, for here he gets neither smiles, nor hardly civil Avords ; \" \u2014 with much more to the same effect. \"I like Lord Deptford,\" said Lucy, giving back the letter. \" So do I,\" replied Susan. \" His manners are so cordial and friendly, and then he is so much attached to his uncle. I Avonder if his sisters are like him.\" \" Deptford,\" said Sir Hubert, one morning at breakfast, \" I have received a letter from Miss Ashford, and she desires me to thank you for the very able manner in which you have executed the commission you under took.\" \" Do you mean to say,\" replied Lord Dept ford, assuming a most dolorous expression, and glancing slyly at his mother, \" do you mean to say that she does not intend to an swer my letter herself?\" \" Apparently not.\" \" Then I take you all to witness that I am"], [72, "64 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. the most ill-used man at this moment in Christendom. Oh, the ingratitude of wo men ! \" Nonsense, Deptford!\" interposed his mo ther. \" Miss Ashford sIioavs her good sense, and I feel a great respect for her. She knows that a correspondence with a young man, with Avhom she is totally unconnected, is not ex actly decorous.\" \" But Ave are connected, mother. She is Uncle Hubert's Avard.\" He said it so comic ally that everybody laughed. \" But who is this Miss Ashford, and what commission did she give you ? \" asked pretty Miss Trevor. \" She is my uncle's Avard, as I have just said, and \" \" You may add,\" said Sir Hubert, \" the sis ter of one of my dearest friends.\" \" As regards the commission,\" continued Lord Deptford, \" it is a lady's secret, and con sequently, it is impossible for me, as a man of honour, to reveal it. I wish, Miss Trevor, to impress this particularly on your mind, as I"], [73, "65 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. hope that in time you will think me worthy to be intrusted with secrets of your own.\" \" I have no secrets, thank goodness,\" re torted the young lady ; \" and when I have, I do not think I shall take you for my father confessor.\" The death of poor little Rose Ashford was, I am afraid, a great relief to Marston. He reflected with a sort of satisfaction that now, with the exception of old Mr Baines, the Digbys, and her brother, there was no one to claim connection with her; for, whatever had been the original respectability of her father's family, it had been quite merged in the dis graceful career of that unhappy man. It was therefore with a strong feeling of annoyance that he received about Christmas a letter from Mrs Digby, announcing that her sisters-in-law had at length succeeded in persecuting their father into giving a ball on Twelfth-night, and entreating him to allow Susan to accept the invitation that had been sent her. \" We have all set our hearts upon it,\" she wrote, \" and it will be a real advantage to Susan to go a little VOL. II. .j"], [74, "66 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. into society, before she is called upon to do the honours of your house.\" Susan also wrote by the same post. \"I need not tell you, dearest Hubert, that unless you could come yourself I shall have but small pleasure in such a party, but Lucy is so anxious that I should go, that, unless you disapprove, I should like to accept.\" The case was embarrassing, for Marston was fully alive to the inconveniences of a woman having two different sets of society. If Miss Ashford accepted invitations now, Lady Marston must return them hereafter ; for he was far too high-minded to recognize the possibility of knowing people one day, and cutting them the next. Mr Digby was a man of excellent family, no doubt, and his objec tions certainly did not extend to his friend John or his little lady-like wife ; they would always be welcome guests in his house at all times and seasons ; but there was no saying what acquaintances his future wife might make, what intimacies she might form, if once introduced into society under their auspices. Of course, when an attorney gives a ball, he"], [75, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 67 cannot afford to offend his clients by leaving them out ; and a man may be invaluable as a client, and yet a most ineligible member of society. Excellent reasoning, but which he could not very well make use of in answer to Mrs Digby 's communication. In his perplexity he took his nephew into his confidence, and asked his advice. \" Let her go by all means,\" was the reply. \" Aunt Susan has quite good sense and even pride enough, unless I am much mistaken, to avoid any intimacy with people you might dis approve of. If I were you, however, I would write her a line of warning.\" Sir Hubert saw that the advice was good, and acted upon it. In fact, there was no other course to pursue, without inflicting a cruel mortification on his best friends. Having made up his mind, he wrote at once in such courteous terms, that poor Mrs Digby very naturally concluded that he was delighted with her proposal. To Susan he wrote in rather a different strain. \" You know, my own dearest,\" he said, \" that I can have no greater pleasure than in complying with any"], [76, "68 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. request of yours, and I hope you will enjoy this your first ball. My great regret is that it is out of my power to be there with you. Most unfortunatelv that night is fixed for our Hunt-ball, and as I am one of the stewards I must attend. One little word of caution let me give you. Professional people are often obliged to ask to their large parties men and women, whom they would be very sorry to admit to the intimacy of their families. Avoid as much as you can making promiscuous acquaintance. You need not mention this to your cousin. She might feel hurt by it.\" He might have spared himself the trouble of writing this word of caution. Mrs Digby was quite as much alive as himself to the necessity of discretion in selecting; Susan's partners, and she had exacted from her a promise, very readily given, to dance with no one who was not introduced to her by herself or her husband. Amongst her other accomplishments, Susan, since her return to Acton, had perfected her self in the science or mystery of dancing, but she felt no great inclination to make use of"], [77, "69 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. the knowledge she had acquired on the present occasion. \" Dear Lucy,\" she said, \" I had much rather sit still. It will amuse me much more, for I do not feel at all dis posed to dance with people I do not know.\" \" Nonsense, child,\" replied the matron. \" Girls go to balls to dance. It would only be making yourself conspicuous if you did not do as others do. John has desired me to engage you for the first waltz with him, and he has invited some of his old friends on pur pose for you. Yon must consider him as representing Sir Hubert.\" And two days before the great event Sir Hubert himself arrived. Mrs Tindal received him. Susan, she said, was trying on her ball\" dress, but no doubt would be down in a few minutes. \" Oh, Mrs Tindal, beg her to come clown in it. I am dying to see it.\" Mrs Tindal was a little surprised at the warmth with which he spoke, but departed to execute her errand, and soon returned with her charge, blushing and smiling, and looking more lovely than ever in a very simple and"], [78, "70 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. becoming evening dress. It is all very well to talk about beauty unadorned, but in reality no woman looks the worse, for being attired in a costume suitable to her age and position. It must be a poor picture indeed, which is obscured by the frame in which it is set. So at least thought Marston. \"My own Susan,\" he said, \" you are perfect. One kiss I must have.\" And it was not till he had accom plished this outrageous breach of decorum, that he perceived Mrs Tindal looking on, with astonishment and dismay depicted on her countenance. \" My dear lady,\" he ex claimed, hardly able to refrain from a smile, \" I throw myself upon your mercy. And I think you will extend it to me when I tell you, what so good a friend as you have been to Susan has a right to know. Susan has promised to be my wife ; and I invite you to our wedding next summer, \u2014 the first invitation that has been given.\" This explanation was so far satisfactory that the rigidity of Mrs Tindal's features relaxed. She congratulated them on the happy prospect before them, and finally took credit to herself"], [79, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 71 for having long foreseen this termination of Sir Hubert's guardianship. She then pressed him to remain for their early dinner, an in vitation which he gladly accepted ; and then started to return to the Priory by the after noon train. But before his departure he clasped round Susan's neck a pearl necklace, as an amulet, so he said, to prevent her quite forgetting him before they next met. During the last few months, Susan had in dulged in what to her seemed great dissipa tion. She had twice dined in company with the Digbys at Lucy's father's, Mr Baines, her other guardian ; her cousin taking care to in form her, that the fact of her having received a second invitation from that somewhat mo rose and gout-afflicted individual was a strong proof of favour, not accorded to many. She had also dined as often at old Mr Digby's, and generally met one or two of his daughters when she paid her weekly visit to Kensington. They were pleasing, unaffected girls, two out of the five being decidedly pretty. An inti macy soon sprung up. It was almost as one of the family that she was received by them all,"], [80, "72 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. whenever they chanced to meet ; and, as such, she began to take as much interest in the success of their ball as they did themselves. And it was successful ; Mr Digby had not thought it necessary to invite any one with whom he had only a professional acquaintance. \" At the office I am an attorney,\" he said, with characteristic good sense ; \" in my own house I am a private gentleman, and I will not ask to it any one with whom I do not choose my girls to associate.\" It was really a very good ball \u2014 full of pretty faces and gen tleman-like men. John Digby's college-friends did wonders ; and Susan, to her great surprise, found herself scarcely missing a dance, and what was still more extraordinary, enjoying it. It was only as they were rolling homewards through the deserted streets, that she whisper ed to her cousin, \" Do you think Hubert will like my having danced so much?\" \" Of course he will. What could he sup pose you went to a ball for, but to dance ? Why, it is the very thing he has been doing himself all night, and very likely is at it still.\""], [81, "73 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Yes, but he is one of the stewards, and is obliged to dance.\" \" My dear Susan,\" said Digby, who had long since thrown off all coldness of manner and tone when he addressed his wife's cousin, \" depend upon it, every man likes to know that his choice is confirmed by the approba tion of others. I shall tell Marston, half the success of our ball was' owing to you.\" Susan laughed one of the joyous laughs of her childhood, which had come back to her of late. \" Oh, Mr Digby, he will never believe that.\" \" Well, then, I will include myself. Our first waltz decided it.\" Lucy silently thanked her husband, by taking his hand, and pressing it unperceived."], [82, "74 CHAPTER IV. At length the months of separation came to< a close. Marston with his sister and nieces returned to London, and the Priory was deserted ; but not before Lady Deptford had reaped some of the fruits of her maternal de votion. Her eldest daughter, Cecilia, was engaged to Lord Windermere, and a very promising flirtation had been established be tween Mary Wilmington and Sir Richard Bertie, which the genial climate of a London season might bring to maturity. Lord Dept ford, much to his disgust, had been obliged in the early part of January to rejoin his regi ment, but he consoled himself by reflecting that in another year he would be of age, when"], [83, "75 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. naturally the necessity of attending to his parliamentary duties could always be pleaded, as an excuse for neglecting those of his pro fession. Cedant arma tog\u0153. Fortunately, too, he was at present quartered at Hounslow, so that he did not anticipate any great social privations, for this season at all events. On arriving at the station in London, the party separated ; Lady Deptford going to her own house in the sacred precincts of Belgravia, and her brother to his old abode in May Fair. Edith was exceedingly anxious to accompany him and keep house for him, and fairly burst into tears when her mother told her rather sharply, that her holidays had lasted too long as it was, and that she must now make up for lost time, for which purpose a perfect treasure of a governess had been secured, who would enter on her functions forthwith ; a much more competent personage than Emma Smithson. \" But I loved Emma,\" sobbed out Miss Edith. \" And she nursed Deptford so well.\" Marston made very few changes in the ordi nary routine of his London life, except in the"], [84, "76 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. frequency of his rides to Acton, in which he sometimes allowed his nephew to accompany him. By Susan Lord Deptford was always received with pleasure. It was not very likely that as Sir Hubert's wife she would ever stand in need of a friend, but, should such ever be the case, something like instinct told her that she would find a firm and attached one in him. Mrs Tindal also fell a captive to his attractions, when, gravely seating himself at her worsted work, he executed a piece of cross-stitch in most masterly style. He also called more than once on the Digbys, for he had taken a great liking to Lucy, though he stood a little in awe of her husband, but had never succeeded in finding any one at home. Worse still, though the Sunday dinners had been resumed, he had never received an invitation. Sunday evenings are proverbially dull in London, and the less chance there seemed to be of gratifying it, the greater was his desire to be admitted to the little family reunions at Kensington. \" Does Digby never mean to ask me to dinner?\" he said one day to his uncle. \"I"], [85, "77 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. am brought to the brink of ruin by the stationer's bill for cards left at his door ; I have worn out two hats in taking them off to Mrs Digby, whenever I meet her, and as yet I have never obtained admittance within her doors.\" \" My dear Deptford,\" replied Marston, \" Digby would think that he was taking a great liberty in asking you to dinner. He does not half like his position, and being very sensitive on the subject \u2014 and between ourselves, as proud as Lucifer \u2014 he carefully avoids any thing that might look like a wish to thrust himself into the society of those who would look down upon him. His father has a capital and most lucrative business, and did not wish it to be lost. But he ought to have made John a barrister, and then he would have held his own anywhere, for there are few of us with better blood in our veins than Digby.\" \" I should think not,\" exclaimed Lord Deptford. \" As for me, everybody knows that my grandfather was an alderman, and got his peerage by lending his money judi-"], [86, "78 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. ciously. I only wish he had left a little more of that commodity to his descendants.\" \" For heaven's sake, don't let my sister hear you talk in such a strain,\" said his uncle, laughing. \" But if you really wish to dine at Digby's, I will tell him so, and I am sure he will be delighted ; for, though you might not guess it through his silent, reserved manner, you are rather a favourite. I remember his confiding to us one day, that beneath the mass of affectation in which you thought pro per to envelop yourself, there was the making of a man in you. Now, in his phraseology, man is the highest expression of praise.\" \" I am sure I am very much obliged to him for his good will. But, seriously, I really should like to be asked. I must pass the next fortnight at Hounslow, but if you can manage it after that, I should be obliged to you. After all, as your nephew, I ought to be considered as one of the family.\" Accordingly, one Sunday he went down with his uncle to Kensington rather early for dinner, for Marston always made a point of being half an hour too soon, that he might"], [87, "79 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. have a chance of conversing with Susan before any one else arrived. That he would be received courteously, Lord Deptford fully expected, but he was not prepared for the excessive cordiality with which Digby shook hands with him, and expressed the great pleasure he felt at seeing him. Presently Lucy and Susan entered the room, and the former began at once, \u2014 \" Oh, Lord Deptford, I have heard such an account of your doings! I have a great mind to scold you.\" Lord Dept ford blushed scarlet. What young gentleman would not quake at such an exordium ! \u2014 \" What do you think, Susan ; he stood first for purchase, and not only gave up his chance, but lent the money to another man to pur chase a troop in his stead. Don't you think we ought to lecture him ? \" \" Oh, is that all ? \" said the accused, ap parently much relieved. \" All ! I should like to know what Uncle Hubert will say.\" \" Well, you see, I did not much care about it, and poor Fleming has been passed over twice before, so it was but an act of justice."], [88, "80 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. And then, to tell you a secret, I found out that he was in love with some girl or other, and her father would not give his consent till he had got his troop. I like the course of true love to run smooth, don't you, Aunt Susan ? \" Aunt Susan's eyes were moist with sym pathy, and she readily agreed that it was much better that it should be so. \"Moreover,\" he continued, \"it is really absurd that I should be a captain so young, and it is only waiting a couple of months longer.\" \"Do you know,\" asked Lucy, \"who this some girl or other is ? \" \" No, I never asked; but I know Fleming well enough to be sure that he will introduce no one into the regiment who will not be a credit to it.\" \" It is Charlotte, Charlotte Digby. John's sister, my sister. She, and Fanny, and Captain Fleming are coming here to dinner. She said she should never know a moment's rest till she had thanked you herself.\""], [89, "81 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Then I'm off. Fleming has been per secuting me for the last week with his grati tude and all sorts of bosh. It is very hard that a man cannot do a good-natured thing for once in his life, without suffering for it. My dear Mrs Digby, you must contrive to save me from it.\" \" Of course, if you wish it, but it will be a disappointment to her.\" The two sisters came, and soon after them Captain Fleming, so soon indeed, that it was shrewdly surmised that he had escorted them, within sight of the house at least. It was a very happy party, and the dinner itself unex ceptionable. Mr Digby had been admitted to a larger share in the business, and consequently in the profits, of the office ; and his establish ment had assumed a corresponding increase. He had now a man-servant. Lucy had fought hard for a many-buttoned page \u2014 she thought it would look well with her brougham, \u2014 but her husband was inexorable. A page eats more, breaks more, and is not half so useful as a man. \" In short,\" he said, \" I VOL. II. 6"], [90, "82 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. can afford the one, but I cannot afford the other.\" And Lucy submitted, like the good little wife that she was. Lord Deptford found himself seated between his hostess and her sister Fanny, out and out the prettiest of the Digbys. Better still, she was as good-humoured and lively as she was pretty, and they soon arrived at an excellent understanding. She had begun, uncon scious of the interdict laid upon the subject, by what was nearest her heart. \" Oh, Lord Deptford, how can Charlotte, how can we all, thank you \u2014 \" \"I beg your pardon, Miss Digby, for inter rupting you,\" said Lord Deptford, \" but do you see that hat in the corner of the room? That hat I have surreptitiously introduced, in consequence of a vow I have made to leave the house at once, if anything relating to that bore Fleming is introduced. And yet I con fess,\" he continued, looking very pathetic, \" I am very hungry, and I see no end of good things before me. Miss Digby, you hold my fate in your hands.\" She laughed, but replied a little warmly,"], [91, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 83 \" Captain Fleming is not a bore ; we all love him like a brother ; almost as well as John.\" \" Ah, you do not know him, I see. I wonder if your unfortunate sister will ever forgive me my part in this melancholy trans action.\" \"You are laughing at me, now, Lord Dept ford ; but remember, if you provoke me too much, I know now how I can send you dinner less to bed.\" Lucy would not have interrupted their con versation for the world. She was discussing matters of deep interest with Sir Hubert, who sat on the other side of her; but still a thought of how ' nice ' it would be, if those two took a liking to each other would from time to time, flash across her. She was incorrigible, that woman. Her husband read pretty accurately what was passing in her mind, and gave her a sort of warning look, which made her colour ; but I am afraid it was only at having been found out. Before the ladies withdrew, Lord Deptford, who had gradually worked himself up to the highest spirits, asked permission to propose a"], [92, "84 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. toast. \" I am aware,\" he said, \" how ill-bred and presumptuous in me it must seem, to have recourse to so antiquated a proceeding. I can only plead my motives, which are of the most innocent and even praiseworthy nature. I have the honour to propose the healths of all the brides of the present year \u2014 past, present, and to come.\" Charlotte Digby blushed and smiled, but on poor Susan the effect was still more marked, especially as it was totally unexpected, and the eyes of more than one were turned upon her, for, though still a profound secret, the state of the case between her and Marston was pretty generally understood in that house. \" How could you be so ill-natured ! \" said Fanny. It must be so embarrassing to both of them.\" \" Both of them ! \" he exclaimed, in affected astonishment. \" To what two are you allud ing? Oh, I see now ; how stupid of me I Fleming and your sister, of course.\" \" You know very well what I mean. I must think it very ill-natured and malicious.\" \" Good gracious, I hope it does not affect"], [93, "85 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. you. You cannot have the cruelty to tell me that I have been sitting all this time by a bride expectant.\" \" Of course not. How can you be so ab surd ! I positively hate you.\" \" Now Miss Digby, you know you are tell ing stories.\" \" In the first place I am not Miss Digby. Charlotte is Miss Digby ; I am only Fanny. And in the next place I never tell stories. Just now I feel to hate you.\" \" Miss Fanny, I have a great mind to prove to you that I am not to be hated with im punity.\" \" Do your worst. I defy you.\" \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said LordDeptford, *' as there seems to be a sort of hesitation as to who ought to return thanks for the toast we have just had the pleasure of drinking in Mr Digby's excellent claret, Miss Fanny Digby desires me to say that, feeling herself above all suspicion of personal interest in the question, she will be happy to take that duty on her self.\" Miss Fanny had a spirit of her own. There"], [94, "86 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. was an ominous flashing of her eyes as she ac cepted the challenge thus thrown out to her, and she had a sharp retort at the tip of her tongue ; but a better feeling prevailed, and she had recourse to the more orthodox revenge of heaping coals of fire on her enemy's head. \" Lord Deptford,\" she said, \" is so far right, that I wish to do what no one has yet had the grace to do. Certainly not to return thanks for his absurd toast, but to thank him, in my sister's name, for the happiness which his unexampled generosity has conferred upon her and all of us.\" \" Bravo, Fanny ! \" was the universal exclama tion, while Lord Deptford, pretending to hide his face in his hands, said to her in a sort of aside, \" That is turning the tables on me with a vengeance. Surely now you can afford to forgive me my impertinence.\" \" We shall see. It will depend entirely on your future good conduct,\" she replied, as, in obedience to a sign from her sister-in-law, she rose from table. Susan Ashford's eighteenth birthday, which was to seal her fate, was fast approaching, and"], [95, "87 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Marston urged her to allow him to announce their engagement to the different members of his own family. For some undefinable reason she endeavoured to delay it as long as possi ble. Perhaps she shrank from the ordeal of criticism to which she would inevitably be ex posed ; perhaps she feared the opposition of her lover's kindred ; or it may be \u2014 for she had a strong- dash of romance about her \u2014 that she only regretted the charm of mystery in which their intercourse had hitherto been shrouded. She yielded however at last to his arguments, backed as they were by those of Lucy and her husband. Lord Deptford, also, was very earnest on the same side of the question, for he had been latterly asked more than once what took his uncle so frequently to Acton ; and he dreaded lest Sir Hubert's visits to Mrs Tindal's cottage might be made the subject of comments, very unpleasant to its inhabitants. And in fact more than one ill-natured story had been set afloat. There is probably no place in the world in which a man may remain more securely concealed, provided concealment be his object, than London. Many do not"], [96, "88 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. know the names of their next-door neighbours, perhaps not even of those who lodge in the same house with them. But if a man mixes much in the world he becomes at once public property ; the very boys in the streets know to what door to rush, in order to be in readiness to hold his horse when he alights ; and at his club there are sure to be two or three elderly gentlemen, who are intimately acquainted with all his thoughts, words, and actions, who know to a minute the hours at which he rises, dines, and goes to bed. It is not therefore to be wondered at, that Marston's movements should be the subject of speculation in the private in quiry office of the clubs, or that his sister, Lady Deptford, should have received some very significant hints on the subject. Being the properest of women, she was naturally one of the first to be regaled with any fresh tale of gossip and scandal. A few days after the dinner at Digby's, Marston called upon her, with the intention of informing her of his approaching marriage; and was debating with himself in what terms to announce it, so as to make it as palatable"], [97, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 89 to her as possible, when she herself, eager to gratify her curiosity, afforded him the op portunity. \"My dear Hubert,\" she said, \" Lady Cheviot tells me that she has met you two or three times on the Acton road lately, and that you were so absorbed in thought that you never noticed her.\" \" Didn't I ? That was very rude of me ; but when a man is thinking of marriage, he may be excused for a little absence of mind.\" \"Marriage!\" exclaimed Lady Deptford much aghast. \" I was told that there was a lady in the case, but I thought, I under stood \" \" Listen to me, Emily, and never mind what you were told. The object of my visit this morning is to inform you that I am engaged to my ward, Miss Ashford, and that we shall be married in the course of next month.\" \" Miss Ashford ! Good Heavens ! My dear Hubert, have you considered what you are about? Marrying a girl nobody knows. I dare say Miss Ashford is an excellent person, but the world will say, ' Who is she ? ' ' \" I will answer all your questions seriatim."], [98, "90 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. I have fully considered what I am about. Miss Ashford is, as you say, an excellent per son. Her father was in a public office till he retired upon a pension. He died last year. Her mother is also dead ; she was the daughter of Archdeacon Baines.\" Lady Deptford walked about in great agita tion. \" I entreat of you, Hubert, to think it over again. It is not a marriage for you ; it is not a marriage that your friends can ap- prove.\" \" I thought I had told you, Emily, that we are engaged ; and therefore, if I wished to reflect, the time for reflection is past. But if our engagement were dissolved to-night, I would endeavour to renew it to-morrow. As for the approbation of my friends, I shall of course be delighted to have it ; if it is denied me, I shall do without it as well as I can. Of your sympathy at least I feel certain, and I hope you will accompany me to-morrow to Acton, to be introduced to your future sister in-law.\" \" Indeed, indeed, I cannot,\" exclaimed Lady Deptford, wringing her hands. \" Deeply as"], [99, "91 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. I am attached to you, you must not exact this from me. I must not fly in the face of the world, for I have daughters to whom such a connection will be most prejudicial.

Perhaps hereafter, when she is your wife, when my girls are established, I shall be able to follow the dictates of my heart.\" \" Exactly. \"When your countenance can no longer be of use, you will be ready to extend it to her ; when her own merits have secured her position in society, you will have no objec tion to make her acquaintance. No, thank you, Lady Deptford. Either you go with me to-morrow to call upon her, or we meet as strangers in future. Really, after your inti macy with my brother's wife, to refuse making Miss Ashford's acquaintance seems to me to be straining at a gnat after swallowing a camel.\" \" My children were not out then,\" sobbed out Lady Deptford. Marston deigned no reply, but left the room"], [100, "92 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. and the house. He was deeply grieved and annoyed at his bad success, more for the pain which he knew it would inflict upon Susan than for his own mortification. Having made a commencement, however, he determined to proceed, and sought out Lord Windermere at the hotel in which he was lodging. Marston not only informed him of his intended mar riage, but of all that had passed between him and his sister. Lord Windermere, who was a year or two older than his visitor, looked very grave. \" Will you allow me to speak openly to you, without being offended?\" he said. The two were on the best possible terms, and Lord Windermere was essentially a peace maker. Marston replied, without hesitation, \" You cannot oblige me more.\" \" Well then, you must make allowances for your sister. There is a vague report that you have a mistress living somewhere in the direc tion of Acton. It was only last night that Deptford positively insulted Colonel Fotherin gay,for some allusion he made to this supposed liaison. No doubt Lady Deptford has been"], [101, "93 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. mixing up this story with your present en gagement.\" \" Good God ! Do you mean that my sister, that any one, could think me so incon ceivably base as to seduce my own ward. Surely, Windermere, you could not think so.\" \" Not for a moment. Indeed, from the first I disbelieved the whole story. It is however but fair to add, that no name was ever men tioned, and the fact of your having a ward at all is probably unknown.\" \" But what am I to do ? The mere fact of my sister's refusing to visit Miss Ashford will be sufficient to confirm the story, and to point her out as the person alluded to.\" \" Yes, it is most essential that your family should notice her at once. I will see Lady Deptford, and endeavour to set matters right. I do not think it will be very difficult. My mother is coming up to town for my marriage, and as of course she will give us a dinner, or party of some sort or other, I will insist upon her asking Miss Ashford. Though I am wrong to use the word ' insist,' for she is al ways ready to do a good-natured action. As"], [102, "94 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. for myself, I will tell Lady Deptford that I wish Cecilia to be introduced to her aunt in petto. If she persist in refusing, I can only promise you that our first visit after our mar riage shall be to Miss Ashford.\" \" By Jove, Windermere, you are indeed a friend in need. I shall never forget your kindness.\" \" My dear fellow, I feel so happy myself that I wish to see every- one else so. Besides, it is but natural that I should endeavour to stand well with Cecilia's uncle.\" \" Of course, and when you know Susan you will wish to stand well with her too.\" \" Pray when you see her commend me to her good graces. And that puts me in mind that I have not congratulated you, which I do most sincerely. As I was walking home last night with Deptford, after his passage of arms with Fotheringay, he raved so much about Miss Ashford \u2014 her beauty, her grace, and her good sense \u2014 that I began to think he was half inclined to fall in love with her himself. Does he know how the affair stands ?\" \" Perfectly ; ever since it was settled.\""], [103, "95 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Lord Windermere's good offices with Lady Deptford were not needed. That prudent lady, as soon as her brother left her, began to reflect on the possible consequences of the rupture with which she was threatened, and she arrived at the conclusion that it would be attended by many disadvantages, without any sufficient counterpoise. Not that she could quite re concile herself to her brother's marrying at all, but it struck her that, as it was inevitable, it was perhaps more desirable that his wife should be one totally unused to society, one who would need a guide, and who would be grateful for the patronage extended to her, rather than one of her own set, who might re ject her suggestions, rebel at her interference, set her at defiance, and barely tolerate her as a guest in the house in which she had so long reigned supreme. To do her justice, it never for a moment entered her head that Susan Ashford was her brother's mistress. She knew him too well to suspect him of an intrigue with his ward. Perhaps too her con science did prick her a little for the part she had played, on occasion of Caroline Wood's"], [104, "96 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. marriage with Sir Charles Marston, and thought the present a good opportunity for condoning the offence. Hubert was now the head of her family, and as such she loved him with the love which she was capable of feeling. As far as it went, it was sincere, but it was much on a par with the affection which a cat is supposed to feel for the house which gives it shelter. Influenced by these feelings, she wrote him a charming note, on charming paper, headed by a charming monogram, which he found waiting for him on his return home. \" My dear brother,\" she said ; \"On recover ing from the state of agitation into which our late distressing. interview threw me, I reflected deeply on what had passed between us. I have now no hesitation in saying that I was wrong. Forgive me, for it was my attachment to you,my anxious desirefor your welfare, and \u2014 why should I not confess it \u2014 my ambition for you, that made me express my disappointment, at hearing of a marriage so far inferior in a worldly point of view to what you might aspire to. But, after all, you are the best judge of"], [105, "97 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. what is likely to constitute your happiness. That you may find it in your union with Miss Ashford is my most earnest prayer. Of her amiable qualities I have not a doubt, having heard so much of her from Deptford and Edith. It only remains for me to say, that I shall be most happy to make her acquaintance, and I leave it to you to ascertain when it will be convenient for her to receive my visit. Ever, my dear brother, your most affectionate sister, E. Deptford.\" It is needless to say that these overtures were accepted ; but Marston's first care was to remove Susan from Acton, in order to obliter ate as far as possible all traces of connection between his bride and his supposed mistress. He consulted the Digbys, but though they could give Susan an occasional bed, they could not take her in for any length of time. From this dilemma they were rescued by old Mr Baines, who, to the surprise of every one, de clared that his cousin should be married from his house; and in the mean time invited her to take up her abode with him, and to bring Mrs Tindal with her. This invitation she ac- vol. ii. 7"], [106, "98 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. cepted, not without a certain amount of dread, it must be confessed, but that soon passed away. Having once made up his mind to this infringement of his habits and customs, the old gentleman determined to execute his self-imposed task as graciously as possible. To Susan were referred all domestic arrange ments ; the carriage was placed at her orders; the breakfast-hour, the dinner-hour were changed to suit her convenience. In short, Susan was mistress of the establishment, much more so than his own daughter had ever been ; and Lucy told her that it was a pity she was engaged to Sir Hubert, as, had she still been free, her father would most certainly have offered her his hand."], [107, "99 CHAPTER V. As soon as Susan was fairly established in her new domicile, Marston took his sister to call upon her. A visit of that nature is always a trying ceremony for all parties; and as Lord Windermere had expressed a wish that Miss Wilmington should accompany her mother, Sir Hubert decided that, to diminish the awkwardness of a first interview, there should be a presentation of the whole family en masse. Mrs Digby was there to support her cousin, and Lord Deptford, who had contrived to in sinuate himself into the good graces of Mr Baines, had also found his way there, with the same intention. Lady Deptford was every-"], [108, "100 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. thing that she ought to be. If she did not quite like the duty that had been imposed upon her, now that she had accepted it, she determined to show no repugnance. Her manner was kind, almost affectionate, as, going up to Susan and kissing her, she said, \" My dear Susan, \u2014 at least, I hope you will allow me to call you so, \u2014 I am delighted to make your acquaintance, for I can now sincerely con gratulate my dear brother on his choice.\" She then introduced her daughters, but this Edith resented as a personal affront. \" Oh, mamma, you forget what friends Susan and I are. I am so glad, Susan, you can't think. But remember, it was all me. Hubert did not think of it till I married you.\" \" How do you know anything about it, Pussy ? \" asked her brother. \" Oh, because I recollect Hubert was so cross to Susan before, that I saw her cry one day.\" \" Enfant terrible ! \" said Marston, making a feeble attempt to laugh ; \" but, at all events, I hope you will never see her cry again on my account.\""], [109, "101 SIR HUBERT MARSTON- By this time, Lady Deptford was in deep conversation with Mrs Digby, striving to im press her with an idea of the great interest she took in her dear brother's welfare, and how agreeably she was surprised by Miss Ashford's appearance. She really meant what she was saying, to a certain extent, but un fortunately she overdid it ; and Lucy, who was well acquainted with her character, not only by common report, but by her husband's more precise revelations, gave her no credit for sincerity, but set her down at once as an accomplished hypocrite. She listened to her with affected simplicity, occasionally asking her some awkward question, or expressing her satisfaction that Susan had the good fortune to meet with Lady Deptford's approbation. \" She does, indeed,\" said that lady. \" I was prepared for great beauty and even charm of manner, but I confess I was not prepared to see a person so thoroughly quiet and lady like, and with such perfectly good manners,\" \" Indeed ! Why not ? \" Lady Deptford recollected in time that she was speaking to Miss Ashford's cousin. \"I"], [110, "102 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. knew,\" she said, \"that Miss Ashford had never mixed much in society, and I expected to find her more \u2014 more unformed \u2014 in short, more of the school-girl.\" \"Latterly she has lived a good deal with me. \" Oh ! That accounts for it, then.\" In the mean time, the rest of the party were getting on very well together in another part of the room. Susan felt herself at her ease at once with her younger visitors ; and though they had not many topics in common, there was no dearth of conversation. On an occa sion of this sort Lord Deptford was invalu able. There was not, perhaps, any great feast of reason, but under his auspices the flow of nonsense \u2014 good, clever nonsense \u2014 was incess ant. The most silent of the party was Mar ston, who was almost nervously anxious about the impression which Susan might make on his relations. Before their departure, a whis pering conversation took place between her and Cecilia Wilmington. Lord Deptford cried out, \" A fine ! a fine ! No whispering in com."], [111, "103 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. pany. Whatever you have to say, say it out. We do not choose to be the victims of secret misrepresentation.\" \" I was only telling Miss Ashford,\" said his sister, \" that Lord Windermere begged me to say that he should have petitioned to be of our party to-day, had he not feared making it too numerous for a first visit. He hopes, however, to be admitted on the next occasion. And now, Miss Ashford, I have a great favour to ask of you. I suppose you know,\" she continued, with a little hesitation ; \" for, of course, Hubert tells you everything, that I am to be married this day fortnight, and I wish you so much to be one of the bridesmaids. Will you oblige me in this ? \" From habit, Susan looked at Sir Hubert before accepting, although she might have known that the request was made with his acquiescence. \" You are spoiling him, Aunt Susan,\" said Lord Deptford, who had seen her look. \"And, of course,\" chimed in Miss Edith, \"I and Mary are to be yours ? \" \" Of course,\" exclaimed her brother ; \"and"], [112, "104 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. I mean to be one, too, to keep you all in order. I will be mother of the bridesmaids. I sup pose there is such an office. If not, there ought to be, and I will create it.\" \"Certainly,\" said Mary Wilmington, \"if you will shave off that moustache, of which you are so proud. We cannot admit a beard amongst us.\" The moustache was rather a tender subject. For years Lord Deptford had cultivated it with the most earnest solicitude and watchful care, and it was only just beginning to reward his labours. He turned the conversation into another channel. \" In your place, Miss Ashford, I should refuse to officiate at Cecy's wedding. For my part, I think it the height of presumption in a niece to thing of marrying before her aunt.\" \" Yes, but she didn't wish it,\" said Edith. \" I heard her tell Lord Windermere that there was no hurry about it. Only, he would have it. Lord Deptford proposed a conundrum ; \" Why are brides elect like bishops elect ? \""], [113, "105 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. But before it was solved, Lady Deptford sum moned her flock around her to depart. \" My dear Miss Ashford,\" she said, \" I must get you and Hubert to fix a day for din ing with us. I hope Mr and Mrs Digby will give us the pleasure of their company at the same time, and if Mr Baines could be prevailed on to accompany you \" \" Oh, thank you ; but my father never goes out,\" said Lucy. \" I was going to say, he hardly leaves his arm-chair. But Mr Digby and myself will have great pleasure in accept ing your invitation.\" \" Well, then, Hubert, you will let me know the day you fix upon ; and as I must have a gathering of the clan previous to Cecy's mar riage, we will have it on the same evening. It will be a good opportunity for presenting them to Miss Ashford. Do you return with us, Hubert ? \" \" Yes ; I have business with Digby. Do you think Mr Baines will give me a dinner to day, Susan ? \" \" I will ask him,\" she replied. \"And do put in a word for me, Aunt"], [114, "106 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Susan,\" added Lord Deptford, as she left the room. She returned in a minute. \" Yes, both of you ; and Lucy and Mr Digby. And he desired me to make an apo logy to you, Lady Deptford, for not waiting on you himself, but he hopes that a fit of the gout will be admitted as a sufficient excuse.\" \" Poor man ! \" said her ladyship. \" Pray, give him my compliments.\" \" Oh, papa ! \" muttered Lucy ; \" I am afraid you are a sad humbug. What was he about, Susan ? \" she asked, when their visitors had left the house. \"Playing at chess with Mrs Tindal, and smoking a cigar.\" Lady Deptford and her party were hardly seated in the carriage, when Miss Wilming ton exclaimed, \" Oh, Hubert, I am enchanted with her. I am sure we shall be great friends. And then her beauty is as near perfection as any thing I can imagine.\" \" Yes, indeed, Hubert,\" said his sister, \" I admire her of all things. A little want of"], [115, "107 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. self-possession, perhaps ; but that is hardly to be wondered at, under the circumstances of our invasion ; and, at all events, it will soon wear off when she comes into contact with society. I am really proud of the sister you have provided for me, and will do my best to smooth her path.\" \" I think she was a little afraid of you, mamma. She was quite at her ease with us. I really felt for her, being produced for inspec tion in that way. I do not believe that there are two girls in the world who could bear such an ordeal so well.\" \"In short,\" said Marston, trying to conceal his gratification, \" I may tell her that you all like her, and, on the whole, approve of her.\" \" I only hope she may approve of us as well.\" Lady Deptford was as good as her word. Having passed the Rubicon, she determined to do her best to get Miss Ashford accepted as a sort of personage in the world to which she belonged. She was far too clever a woman not to support to the utmost of her power a"], [116, "108 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. person soon to be so closely connected with her. Lady Marston, well-received in society, might prove an invaluable ally ; Lady Mar ston, obscure and unknown, could only be a clog and an embarrassment. In consequence, Susan's merits and Susan's perfections were expatiated on to Lady Deptford's intimates at all times and places, in season and out of season. Mr Ashford \u2014 of whose history she knew little or nothing \u2014 was represented as a man who would have risen to high official employment but for ill-health, brought on by his zeal in the public service, which compelled him to retire upon a pension. Susan's maternal grandfather, Dr Baines, was actually first on the list for a bishopric when he died. Susan herself, if not an heiress, had a better fortune than nine girls out of ten. \" In short, my dear Lady Cheviot, it is a marriage that satisfies us all. Family, beauty, talent, and the most amiable disposition. I cannot tell you how happy it makes me to know that my dear brother, after all his wan-"], [117, "109 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. derings, is likely to be so happily settled at last.\" Lady Deptford was not left to fight the battle alone. She found able allies in her son, her daughters, and all those who were in any way under their influence. Marston himself had no lack of friends. His cook was a first-rate artiste,\\\\\\s> cellars were well-stocked, the shooting at Thornwood was excellent, and the hunting as good as could be had out of Leicestershire. Still, it was felt that his establishment would be more complete with a young and handsome wife at the head of it. Here and there, perhaps, a sigh of disappoint ment may have been heard from some fair admirer of the Priory ; but no one could accuse its master of having raised hopes which he had no intention of gratifying. No one could fairly say that she had been the object at any time of his exclusive attentions. The faint murmurs of the disaffected gradually died away; and it was generally conceded, that, in such a matter, Sir Hubert Marston had a right to please himself. Then old"], [118, "110 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Lady Windermere allowed herself to be car ried off by her son to make Miss Ashford's acquaintance, and returned in even worse plight than the sheep of which Miss Bo Peep was the negligent custodian, \u2014 for it was her heart she left behind her. Something there was in Susan that reminded her of a daughter she had lost some years before ; the mother's heart warmed to her at once, and Susan, on whom genuine sympathy and kindness were never thrown away, met her advances with a frank and grateful cordiality that enchanted her. She declared herself at once Miss Ash ford's enthusiastic admirer, and did her good service. For, although it is the fashion to vote old women bores, and to thrust them on one side as pieces of useless lumber, it is nevertheless certain that the good word of one of her own sex, dropping gently and gracefully into honoured old age, after a youth passed without reproach, will do more for a young girl than the unanimous approbation of all the clubs. With such support, it is not wonderful that Susan should have achieved a complete sue-"], [119, "111 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. cess in the various bridal parties, at which she made her debut in society. She was every where recognized as forming part of the family ; and, feeling herself welcomed as such, she speedily fulfilled Lady Deptford's pro phecy, and acquired an ease of manner which was sometimes a subject of astonishment to herself. \" I cannot tell how it is, Hubert,\" she once said to him, \" but at times I feel as if I had never lived in any other society than that in which I now find myself ; as if the past was a dream, which is gradually fading away from my memory. I can scarcely believe, that not two years ago, instead of being treated as an equal by those whose notice confers distinc tion, instead of having every comfort, every luxury of life around me, I was a wretched, miserable servant-girl, driving poor little Rose's perambulator, ill-clothed, ill-fed, ill-treated. And yet I would not forget it, for it is to that I owe my present happiness.\" \" It is not so strange as you may think, my darling,\" her lover replied. \"Now you are in the position you are entitled to ; then, you"], [120, "112 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. were forced into a state of degradation so un natural, that your mind refuses to believe in the possibility of it.\" \" Ah, no ; it is not that. I think, rather, that I am so happy, so unspeakably happy, that my thoughts will not, cannot, dwell upon those horrid scenes. And I owe it all to you. You saved me when I was abandoned by all ; you raised me from the abject state into which I had fallen. Whatever I am, I am through you ; I am your creature ; and then, although utterly unworthy of such a blessing, you gave me your love. Oh, Hubert, promise \u2014 swear that you will never withdraw it from me. Any other misfortune I think I could bear, but against that I should be powerless. I feel as if I should not even have strength to die. I should linger on to suffer.\" \" My dearest love, if that is your only fear, I think you may set your mind quite at ease. But I must not allow you to exaggerate my merits. You owe quite as much to others as to me. There is our friend Wickham and his wife, for instance ; and what do you think of cousin Lucy? \""], [121, "113 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \"Yes, but I owe all these friends to you. Sergeant Wickham would have taken me to the station-house ; and, but for you, Lucy would have never known anything about me.\" \" Dearest Susan,\" said Marston, earnestly, \" there is One I have not named, who watched over you in the hour of your greatest need.\" \" My father ! Poor papa ; he did indeed save me from a dreadful fate.\" \" I did not allude to Mr Ashford, though I meant your Father. Your Father, my Father* the Father of us all.\" \" Ah, I understand you now,\" she replied, with embarrassment. \" But I did pray to Him on that night, and He heard me ; and I always pray to Him every morning and at night, as my mother taught Harry and me.\" \" Then, my love, say that, under God, yon owe all the blessings you enjoy to your mother.\" \" And to you,\" she persisted. Sir Hubert was sincerely religious, as most men are who have passed years holding, so to speak, their lives in their hands. More than VOL. II. 8"], [122, "114 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. once he had escaped almost inevitable death, by what appeared to be the direct interposi tion of Providence, when human wisdom and human aid were alike unavailing \u2022 and now, in his prosperity, he did not forget the hand that had been stretched out to sustain him in his difficulties. He had been more than once startled by Susan's indifference on such sub jects, but, if she was not a believer in the higher sense of the word, she was no infidel. Hers was the indifference of ignorance, not of levity, and he trusted to his own influence and her candour to bring her to a better frame of mind, when once she was his wife. At present, during the hurry and bustle inseparable from their daily occupations, there was no time or opportunity for discussions of so serious a nature. He could not, however, refrain from asking if she had never received any religious instruction since her mother's death, and if she never went to church while residing beneath her father's roof. \" Never,\" was the reply. \" We were never ready in time, and I had no clothes to go in. But I liked Sunday, for I was allowed to lie"], [123, "115 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. an hour longer in bed, and by Saturday night I was fairly tired out.\" Marston muttered something in connection with Mrs Ashford's name, which did not sound the least like a benediction. \" But surely,\" he continued, \"at Mrs Tin dal's you found things very different. She at least gave you religious instruction, and of course you went to church with her.\" \" Oh, yes. We always had morning and evening prayers for the servants, and I was the clerk. And then we always read the Bible for half an hour, but there was so much I could not understand, and when anything puz zled me, she always told me I must judge for myself, that no one had a right to interpret Scripture to another, that it was only the Papists who assumed such an authority, and that all Protestantism was founded on the right of private judgment. ' My belief is that she did not always understand it herself, but I declare there were times when I almost wished I was a Papist too. On Sunday we always went to morning church, and the rest of the day, as you know, I passed at Lucy's.\""], [124, "116 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Well, dearest, I am not quite of Mrs Tindal's opinion, and we will see if we cannot make out these puzzling passages together. In the mean time never forget the gratitude, the love, you owe to God for all He has done for you. \" Oh, yes ! for giving me your love.\" \" My dearest, believe me you are wrong, more so than you are aware of, to bring me thus into competition, as it were, with Him.\" \" It is not competition. I love Him through 3) vou. There was no way, at present at least, of overcoming her pertinacity. \" Well,\" he said, \" we will not continue the argument now, but believe me, love for the creature ought never to supersede love for the Creator. And indeed you must feel this your self, for, not even to please me, would you wilfully be guilty of any act displeasing to Him ? \" \" I do not know. Surely He would forgive me, when He knows it is done for love of you, the love He has implanted in my heart.\" Marston was a good deal shocked by these"], [125, "117 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. somewhat heathenish sentiments. Expostula tion was evidently in vain ; he adopted another course. He took her in his arms and kissed her. \" Hush, hush, my love,\" he said, \" it grieves me to hear such words from your lips.\" \" You are not displeased with me, Hubert, are you ?\" she asked, drawing back from his embrace. \" Displeased with you, my poor darling ! No. But by speaking as you have done, you offend One, whose displeasure is far more to be dreaded than that of man. If you love me, Susan, as you say you do, you will ask Him to pardon your thoughtless words. You know not the pain they gave me.\" \" Oh, forgive me, Hubert, and I will ask Him to forgive me too. But when you are my husband, surely He will not condemn my love for you.\" They parted as fondly as if no difference of opinion had arisen between them ; Susan, in her humility, not venturing to doubt that her lover must be right in his doctrines, and yet with a sort of feeling in her heart of hearts"], [126, "118 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. that his love could not be equal to hers ; while Sir Hubert, though deeply touched by her utter devotion to him, felt that it would be a more difficult task than he had imagined, to root out ideas to which she clung with such tenacity. But, if anything, his affection was rather strengthened by this discovery. He was not easily discouraged by difficulties, and he felt that, in all probability, he alone would be able to bring so precious a freight into port. At length, after dinners and evening parties innumerable, the marriage of Lord Winder mere and Miss Wilmington came off with the proper eclat. Susan, according to promise, officiated as one of the eight bridesmaids ; Lord Deptford gave his sister away with an assumption of dignity which was much ad mired by all the ladies present, and was un mercifully laughed at by all his male friends ; Lady Deptford gave the wedding breakfast ; Marston paid for it ; and, to make all complete, Sir Richard Bertie found an opportunity of proposing to Mary Wilmington, and obtaining a favourable answer, while the register was in process of signature. The newly-married"], [127, "119 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. couple departed for Thornwood Priory, which had been lent them for the occasion by their uncle ; and Lady Windermere, as she was tak ing leave of Miss Ashford, whispered to her, that she might depend upon finding everything in order, when she came herself; for her marriage also was to take place in three weeks ; and Marston had announced his intention of carrying off his bride to her future home at once. \" I hope,\" he said, \" that she will not find her honeymoon the only happy part of her wedded life, but at all events it will be the beginning of it, and I should wish her first married recollections to be connected with her future home.\" All the preparations for their marriage were completed. Settlements were made on the most liberal scale, but upon one point Susan manifested a very strong spirit of opposition. She strenuously objected to the five hundred a-year, which Sir Hubert proposed to settle on her as pin-money, declaring that she had much rather receive what she might require for her own expenditure as her husband's free"], [128, "120 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. gift, than have it secured to her by legal means. Lady Deptford argued in vain against so dangerous a precedent ; even Lucy called her cousin a silly, romantic child, without a grain of common sense in her head. It was not till Mr Baines, who had consented to act as one of her trustees, told her flatly that he would have nothing more to do with her affairs, if she persisted in rejecting the advice of her friends, that she submitted to a compromise. The interest of her own small fortune was settled on her ; for the remainder she was to be indebted to her husband's generosity. Letters had been received from Harry Ash ford in answer to those announcing his sister's engagement, in which he warmly expressed the gratification he felt at her future prospects. In writing to Susan, he told her that she had won a prize, the equal of which the world could not produce, and concluded by saying \u2014 \" If you do not make him as happy as he deserves to be, never venture to call me brother again.\""], [129, "121 CHAPTER VI. They were married in the presence of one of the largest assemblies ever collected in a Lon don church for a purpose of that nature. The invitations had been exceedingly numerous, for Marston felt, that under the peculiar circum stances of the case, too much publicity could not be given to the step he was taking. By marrying Miss Ashford in the light of day, surrounded by his relations and the con nections of his family, he would be crushing at once and for ever any rumours disparaging to his bride, if any such existed. On his side, therefore, the gathering was a large one, while Mr Baines, who gave Susan away, had insisted on the attendance of every one of her mother's"], [130, "122 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. relations, over whom he had any influence. The Digbys, of course, were all there, and formed rather a large party, \u2014 two of Lucy's sisters being nominated as bridesmaids. But with the exception of some few of Marston's old friends and brother-officers, who came to do him honour, the great bulk of the non-invited consisted of those whom simple curiosity had drawn together. The most absurd reports respecting the future Lady Marston had, somehow or other, got into cir culation. The least extravagant were\u2014 that she was an Indian squaw, a Maori princess, or the daughter of some Eastern potentate or Caffre chief, whom Marston had imported, and had been educating for the last two years. But when she walked up the aisle, leaning on the arm of Mr Baines, the colour on her cheeks coming and going as she found herself the point of attraction to so numerous an assem blage, and yet with the glow of conscious happiness on her features, throwing out her beauty into strong relief, an irrepressible murmur of admiration pervaded the sacred edifice. Lord Deptford, who was invested"], [131, "123 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. with some high office for the occasion, had arrived early, and was talking to some of his friends, when the bride made her appearance, and he turned towards them with an air of triumph. \" What do you say to your squaw now, General ? \" he said. It may be as well to remark that Lord Deptford was perfectly cognizant of all the wonderful stories that had been in circulation, and was much amused by them. As they were quite harmless, not only he did not contradict them, but, it is much to be feared, rather assisted in giving them currency. \" Simply this,\" said the old veteran ad dressed, \"that she is the most beautiful creature I have seen for many a long day ; God bless her. And it is well for her that she is, for she has got a batch of bridesmaids who would take the wind out of the sails of most brides.\" \" Ah, yes,\" replied Lord Deptford, caressing his moustache. \" They are a fairish team. I think I have shown my taste and discrimina tion in getting them together. It cost me no> end of trouble, I can tell you.\""], [132, "124 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" I wish they could hear you. I fancy it would cost you still more trouble to get out of their clutches.\" The ceremony went off with the utmost propriety and decorum. Mrs Digby was a little affected, but with that exception there were no tears shed. There was no anxious mother to tremble, in the midst of her joy, at the uncertain future awaiting her child. Susan herself had no home, no parents, no sisters to regret. The past was filled with re collections from which she recoiled, and that past she was casting behind her. Hubert now would take charge of her fate ; what more could she aspire to ! As his wife her happiness was secure. She Avas married with the identical ring, now liberated from its costly case, which, under Miss Edith's ministry, had been placed on her finger some months before, \u2014 a circum stance, which did not escape the sharp eyes of that young lady, and was- commented on by her with great satisfaction. She, too, was one of the bridesmaids, and by virtue of her ex-"], [133, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 125 perience, took upon herself to act as a sort of mistress of the ceremonies. \" Oh, Susan,\" she exclaimed, as soon as they entered the vestry, \" Hubert ought to have kissed you at the end, like John Smith did Hester.\" Nobody could refrain from laughing, some more freely than others, at this reminder to Marston of his bridegroom's duty; but Lady Deptford thought it as well to check her daughter's vivacity. \" Hold your tongue, Edith. Don't let it run so fast in company.\" While her brother added, \" It is a pity, Edith, when you have such admirable senti ments to utter, that you cannot do it with a little more regard to grammar.\" The wedding party adjourned for breakfast to the house of Mr Baines, who had insisted upon taking that duty upon himself. He fras not much in the habit of putting himself to inconvenience, but by some means or other, during her short stay in his house, Susan had made a conquest of him, and had even ex torted a promise from him to accept Sir"], [134, "126 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Hubert's invitation to Thornwood \u2014 provided his convenient ally, the gout, would allow him. Lucy was quite amazed at the ascendancy her cousin had obtained over him, though she bore it very good-humouredly, which was the more praiseworthy, as it far exceeded anything she had been able to establish in her own favour. The fact is, she went the wrong way to work, and endeavoured to obtain her ends by coaxing and cajolery, a process which he easily saw through, and guarded against accordingly. Susan, on the other hand, never attempted anything . of the sort. On her entering his house, he had told her to look upon it as a home, and whatever arrange ments or alterations in his domestic economy she wished him to make, he would endeavour to comply with. She did not avail herself often of this permission, but whenever she did, it was in an honest, straight-forward manner, without any circumlocution, which seldom met with a refusal ; but if once he said that he had rather not, or that it was out of his power to do as she wished, she never returned to the charge. Lucy, with all her"], [135, "127 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. tact, frequently failed ; Susan, without any, generally succeeded. Mr Baines had given Digby carte blanche for ordering the breakfast, and it is needless to say that it was as good a one as could be provided; and, what was equally to the purpose, everybody was disposed to profit by it, except perhaps those in whose honour it had been prepared. And a very happy party they were. Lord Deptford, with a due regard to his own comfort, had contrived to secure a place amongst the bridesmaids, having Fanny Digby on one side of him and his sister Mary on the other, both of whom he kept in a state of chronic laughter, which did not even cease when Lord Windermere, who had come up to town with his wife for the occasion, proposed the healths of the bride and bridegroom, in what Lady Windermere, at least, considered an exceedingly eloquent and affecting speech. She was indignant with her brother for his very indecorous interruptions, but his turn was to come. When the health of the bridesmaids was drunk, so universal a call upon Lord Deptford to return thanks for them"], [136, "128 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. arose from those fair aide-de-camps, that it was evidently pre-concerted. \"Thank you, Miss Fanny,\" he said, \" I owe this to you, but I will pay you off for it.\" She only laughed, and then he proceeded to discharge the duty imposed upon him. \" Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said ; \" As I am the only man present endowed with the modesty and graceful timidity which are the characteristics of bridesmaids in general, and of Lady Marston's in particular, it does not in the least surprise me to find that I have been selected to return thanks in their names. And as it is universally acknowledged that no advocate can do justice to his client without completely identifying himself with him or her, you will allow me to lay aside my sex, for the nonce, and look upon me as a young lady of considerable personal attractions, in the most becoming of bonnets, and acres of muslin.\" \" Tarlatane,\" suggested Fanny. \" Tarlatane, is it ? Well then, acres of tarlatane, whatever that may be. And now, in the first place, we must express the great"], [137, "129 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. happiness it has given us to show, by our service this day, the love and affection we feel for her, who so lately was the brightest ornament of our sacred band. Also, we listened with intense interest to every word of the ceremony at which we assisted, and especially to the vows then pronounced, and we too feel that, when our turn comes, when the proper time arrives, and above all when the proper man makes his appearance, we shall have infinite pleasure in promising to love, honour, and obey. That is to say, we will love him as long as he is amiable, we will honour him as long as he pays our jeweller's and milliner's bills without a murmur, and we will obey him in every thing that is strictly in accordance with our own inclinations. I think I may go as far as that,\" he added, turning to his clients, who expressed their approbation by their smiles. \" You see, gentlemen, signs of adhesion on every side. So take my advice ; lose no time, but strike while the iron is hot. In conclusion, we thank you for the honour you have done us, and beg to drink all your good healths in VOL.

Whether it was carried is not recorded; and, soon after, Sir Hubert and Lady Marston rose to depart, for they had a long journey before them. The rest of the company soon followed their example , and Mr Baines was once more restored to the un disputed possession of his own house, half re joicing in his independence, half sorrowing for the loss of his guest. It was on a delicious evening in the latter part of June, with the full moon just rising into the cloudless sky, that Hubert and his bride drove into Thornwood Park after their long railway journey from London. Some thing there was in the calm stillness of the night, the shadowy scenery through which they were driving, and the uncertain silvery light flitting through the dense groups of trees, which seemed to impress a peculiarly solemn character on their entrance to their future home. So, at least, felt Susan, who could hardly yet realize the events of the"], [139, "131 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. day. She lay back in the open carriage, with her hand clasped in her husband's, lost in a dream of perfect love and perfect happiness. \" Welcome,\" said Marston, as they entered the gates of the park, \" welcome, my own love, to your home. God grant you many, many happy years to enjoy it.\" She tried to say something in return, but she could not speak, and it was a sob that rose to her throat. \" Are you ill, my darling ? \" exclaimed her husband, throwing his arm round her, and drawing her to his breast ; \" or is it that you are tired with this long day ? How thought less in me to bring you all this distance to night ! \" \" Oh no, it is not that,\" she replied, nest ling down to him ; \" but I have no words to express what I feel. It is such a new sensa tion of .perfect peace and security \u2014 such in tense happiness, that I almost dread our ar rival, lest, in leaving the carriage, I should leave some portion of it behind.\" \" My own silly wife, so far from losing any part of your present happiness, I trust that it"], [140, "132 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. will increase every day and every hour. At least, I think I can promise that it shall not be my fault if it do not. You can trust me, Susan, can you not ? \" \" Ah, can you ask it ? And, dear Hubert, I now see how good God has been to me in every way. I will endeavour to prove my gratitude to Him, by making you a good Avife.\" \"On that head I have no fear; and I hope \" He was cut short by the carriage stopping at the door of the Priory. The steps were let doAvn, and Marston led his bride into the hall, where all the servants Avere assembled. \" I need not introduce you to Lady Mar ston, Mrs Halkett,\" he said, addressing the old housekeeper ; \" though she is a new mis tress, she is an old acquaintance.\" \" An old friend,\" said Susan, shaking hands with her. \" I have not forgotten the pains you took to make me comfortable, when I Avas here last year.\" And then passing Avith her husband into the room where supper had been provided"], [141, "133 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. for them, she found a kindly Avord for all Avhom she recognized. It was some days before Lady Marston began to feel at home in her new position. Her husband had insisted upon her assuming at once the management of the household, refusing to interfere in any particular, and leaving her entirely to her own resources. Not unaided, however ; for Mrs Halkett was indefatigable in her exertions to smooth the path for her young mistress ; and, as most of those in the ThornAvood establishment were old and Avell-disciplined servants, the diffi culties were not insurmountable. It is true that Susan pouted a little at times, Avhen Sir Hubert declined laying down his newspaper to assist her in ordering the dinner ; but her remonstrances Avere of no avail. \" I must say it is very ill-natured of you, Hubert,\" she once ventured to say, \" not to come to my aid. There are really so many things on the carte of Avhich I do not even know the meaning. Do tell me, dearest, what you like to have.\" \" Not for the world. If you give me a"], [142, "134 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. bad dinner, I shall scold you, and that is a pleasure I would not deprive myself of on any account. As for the good things Avhose names you do not know, order them all by turns, or all at once, if you like it better, and then you Avill see Avhat they are. My duties are confined to the cellar and out-of-doors work.\" And in the out-of-doors work Susan also soon began to take a great interest. The gar dens Avere committed to her care, but Avith the privilege of consulting her husband whenever she thought proper; and that Avas on every possible occasion. This was intelligible enough \u2014 the garden at Thormvood, though on so much larger a scale, reminded her of her little plot of ground at Acton, which had been the first means of breaking through her reserve with Marston. Besides, the garden is a lady's natural province ; but what was it that induced her to take such an astonishing interest in the farm, to which Sir Hubert devoted a consider able portion of his time ? Perhaps, the very simple calculation that, by entering into her husband's pursuits, she would secure for her-"], [143, "135 STR HUBERT MARSTON. self a larger portion of his society, and accus tom him to look upon her as his inseparable companion. Be that as it may, it is certain that Marston seldom took his Avay to his bailiff's house Avithout having her hanging on his arm, and under his tuition and that of Mr John Smith \u2014 Avhose example Sir Hubert had not folloAved at his own marriage \u2014 she made rapid progress in agricultural lore. Then she made acquaintance with John Smith's AATife, ne'e Spring, who initiated her into all the mysteries of the poultry-yard, which was a source of never-failing delight. In a short time she began to feel a real regard for Hester, Avhose good qualities as a wife fully bore out the praise bestowed upon her by her father. Susan looked upon her as connected, in some mysterious wTay, with her oaati marriage ; and felt as if an undefined bond of union ex isted betAveen them. Mrs Smith was expect ing her confinement in a very few weeks ; and often, while her husband was discussing some abstruse point regarding short-horns or south- downs vvith his master, Susan would take up a needle and thread, and assist her in the"], [144, "136 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. preparations she was making for the expected guest. Nor was Hester's father, Mr Spring, for gotten. With so important a personage as the head gamekeeper Susan had, of course, made acquaintance at her previous visit to Thornwood, and had been treated by him Avith all the condescension to which she was entitled as his master's guest. But iioav she stood before him in a neAv light. Her kindness to his favourite child had Avon the old man's heart, Avhile as Lady Marston, Sir Hubert's wife, she commanded his respect. Whenever she addressed him, his eye lighted up, and his face gloAved with pleasure. She could not have expressed a Avish, however ex travagant, that he would not have endeavoured to gratify, even at the risk of life or limb. \" She be a rare one, she be,\" was his eulo gistic expression ; and with Spring the force of language could no farther go. He Avas not Avithout a sly touch of humour in his way. When Hubert and Susan met him a feAV days after their arrival, the former"], [145, "137 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. congratulated him on the happiness his daugh ter seemed to enjoy. \" Yes, Sir Hubert ; I thank God for it,\" he replied. \" I don't think there is a happier couple noAvhere \u2014 not in these parts, leastways; no offence to Sir Hubert and my lady.\" \" There's room enough for us all to be happy, if Ave do but know how to set about it,\" observed his master. \" But I always thought Hester's marriage would turn out Avell. I remember Avhat a high opinion you had of Smith.\" \" So I had, Sir Hubert ; and it seems to me but yesterday that you were asking me all about their courting. I said to myself, it won't be long before Sir Hubert's turn comes \u2014 begging my lady's pardon for speaking so free.\" \" I am always proud to follow a good ex ample,\" replied Marston, laughing. \" Hoav are the young pheasants getting on ? \" \" Wonderful, Sir Hubert ; it's a pleasure to see them. Perhaps my lady would like to take a look at them.\""], [146, "138 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. My lady thought she should like nothing better. \"Oh the little darlings,\" she exclaimed, when they arrived at a dry, sunny spot where two or three hundred young pheasants, of different sizes, were pecking about in every direction ; while their foster-mothers, confined to their coops, vainly endeavoured, by their cries of distress, to restrain their erratic pro pensities. \" Oh, Hubert, you will not shoot them ? \" \" Well, not all, I dare say.\" \" Poor little things ! How can men find pleasure in such cruelty ! \" \" Cruelty ! I like that, when we are doing violence to our own feelings, in order to pro vide palatable food for our wives and daugh ters. Up early and late, wading through mud, toiling up hills, struggling through brambles and briars, Avith clothes rent and faces scratched, and all this, that you may see a pheasant or partridge smoking upon your board. And then you lift up your hands and eyes, and say, ' What cruelty ! ' Such is the"], [147, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 139 gratitude of woman ! But, hoAvever, Spring, as Lady Marston takes an interest in these young ladies and gentlemen, turn them into the home-preserves, where they will be toler ably safe for this year, at all events.\" Susan pressed her husband's arm, by Avay of thanking him for this concession. Taking leave of Spring and his charge, they sauntered lazily through the park till they arrived at a huge spreading oak, beneath the shade of which they sat doAvn to rest. \" Tell me, Hubert,\" said Susan, indolently, \" all about John Smith's courtship.\" \" There is not much to tell,\" replied her husband. \" It AAras simple enough. He loved Hester, she loved him ; he asked her to marry him, and she consented.\" \" I Avonder what made the gamekeeper think that your turn Avould come next.\" \" Ah, noAv you Avant to bring me to con fession. What put the thought into his head I have no idea, but it is certain that, on the very morning Avhen our conversation took place, I was debating Avith myself hoAV to"], [148, "140 SIR HUBERT AIARSTON. find out whether you cared for me, and the effect of that conversation was to determine me at once to ask you to be my Avife.\" \" Oh, Hubert, hoAV could you ever doubt that I loved you ? \" \" Hoav could I tell ? I certainly thought at one time that you preferred German lessons to fishing.\" \" Ah, dearest, if you could but have known Avhat I suffered when I saw how displeased you Avere ! I am so glad Mr Ainslie has left Thormvood.\" \" So am I, my darling ; but it is time to go in for luncheon. And then you must put on your habit. We will take a real ride to-day.\" For Lady Marston had now added riding to her other accomplishments. By Sir Hu bert's express desire, a riding-habit formed part of her trousseau ; but, strange to say, although she kneAv that her husband Avas in the habit of passing much of his time on horse back, she had not shoAvn any great eagerness to make use of it, Avhen, a feAv days after their arrival, he proposed to give her a lesson. She had never attempted anything of the sort ;"], [149, "141 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. she Avas sure she would be so aAvkAvard ; she thought that there could not be a horse in the stable quiet enough for a beginner. \" My dearest,\" said her husband, in reply to these objections, \" you are quite young enough to learn ; and Avith such a figure as yours it is ridiculous to suppose that you can be awkAvard anywhere. As for the horse, do you suppose I Avould venture to put you on one of which I Avas not quite sure.\" \" Is it the one that Lady Marston- \u2014 your brother's Avife, I mean \u2014 used to ride ? \" she asked, bringing out the Avords one by one, as if they burnt her tongue. \" Oh, no. I gave that to Cecilia, when she was here in the autumn. But there,\" he con tinued, giving her a letter addressed to her, \" Read and see.\" The letter was from Lord Deptford. \" My dear Aunt Susan, confess that in your heart you thought the bracelet I gave you a very shabby wedding-present. And so it was; but the truth is, Hubert commissioned me to look out for a perfect lady's horse for you, which I undertook to do, on condition"], [150, "142 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. of being allowed to give it you myself. I hope you will like him, and that Ave shall en joy many rides together. You may mount him with perfect confidence. Hubert and I have tried him over and over again, and have not been able to find out a fault in him. \" Your affectionate nephew, Deptford.\" When Susan found that there was no inten tion of making over Caroline Marston's horse to her use, her scruples and her timidity van ished as if by magic. She ran up-stairs with girlish glee to equip herself for her first lesson, which Avas given in the riding-house, and re peated every day for hours, till at length, so able was the instructor, and so apt the pupil, that Mr Philpotts, the groom, declared that, to see her in the saddle, any one might suppose that my lady was Yorkshire-bred. Saladin, so Lady Marston named her horse, seemed to real ize all the perfections attributed to him by Lord Deptford, and Marston AAras soon so well satisfied with his Avife's progress, that he de clared her fit for a country ride ; and this was the day appointed for the experiment. Caroline Marston's name Avas to Susan a sort"], [151, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 143 of Bluebeard's fatal chamber, full of mysterious but repugnant interest. BetAveen her and her husband all mention of it, when not unavoid ably necessary, seemed to be tacitly interdict ed, and this did not diminish her curiosity. And by some fatality Caroline was perpetually meeting her at every turn. The gardener referred to the plans of the late Lady Marston, for so she was generally called, and the im provements she had projected. If Susan entered one of the labourers' cottages, she was sure to find some memorial of Caroline, blan kets, an easy chair, a book ; and even John Smith talked to her of Lady Marston's breed of poultry, till she began to detest the very name of one AA'hom she chose to look upon in the light of a rival. These semi-confi dences Avere always made in a tone of kindly respect for the person who Avas the subject of them, and ahvays Avhen Marston Avas not pre sent. If he suddenly made his appearance, the speaker stopped, or passed on to something else. And this, though it was exactly Avhat she would have suggested herself, greatly dis composed her, for it proved that the relations"], [152, "144 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. which had formerly existed between Caroline Wood and her husband were known far and near ; that everybody was aware that she her self Avas not the first object of his love. Her feelings as regarded this unknoAvn sis ter-in-law were a strange mixture, compounded of different elements, each of which, one would have thought, Avould have neutralized the others. She Avas indignant with Caroline for having presumed to win Hubert's \u2014 her Hubert's \u2014 affections ; she was more than indignant with her for the long suffering she had inflicted on him, by jilting him for his brother. And with that, at times, there came across her a strong feeling of compassion, Avhen she thought of Lady Marston's present desolate condition compared Avith the position she had so lately held. All that Susan heard was unsought for and the effect of chance. She had by far too much delicacy to question her dependents on such a subject. Nevertheless, she did once indirectly endeavour to lead Mrs Halkett on to speak of her predecessor. But on this occasion that"], [153, "145 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. worthy lady, usually so voluble and ready to impart information, Avas impenetrable. The poor lady did not seem happy, but she was very good and charitable to the poor, Avas all she said. \"Was not Sir Charles kind to her?\" asked Susan. \" He meant to be, my lady.\" And there it ended. At last Susan could bear it no longer, and, at Avhat she conceived to be a propitious mo ment, asked Marston to tell her something about his sister-in-law. \" My dear Susan,\" he said, \" it is a very unpleasant subject to me, as you may imagine. Caroline has many good qualities, but she is weak and easily led by others. I Avould Avill ingly contribute to her welfare if she would allow me, but I have no wish ever to see her again.\" \" But, Hubert, did you really love her so A'ery much ? \" she persisted. \" I loved her with the love of a boy, as I love you with the love of a man. And there VOL. II. 10"], [154, "146 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. let the matter rest. Do not, dearest, mar my present happiness by evoking disagreeable re collections of the past.\" Was it satisfactory, or was it not ? She could not quite determine ; but at all events it was long before Caroline's name was again mentioned betAveen them."], [155, "147 CHAPTER VII. The original plan of the Marstons had been to go abroad, after passing a few weeks at the Priory, and paying a short visit to the Win dermeres, Avhere Susan was to make a more intimate acquaintance with her neAV connec tions than she had been able to do in London ; but it Avas autumn before they could make up their minds to quit the scene of their present unalloyed happiness. From various causes their sojourn at the Windermeres also Avas prolonged far beyond their first intention. They did not leave England till late in October. The Rhine and Switzerland were necessarily given up for the present ; they crossed the Alps at once, and after two or three weeks"], [156, "148 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. passed at Florence, took up their abode at Rome for the winter. Marston had ' done r Italy some years before, rushing with two brother-guardsmen from one city to the other, as fast as post-horses could carry them, great at dinners, operas, and balls, enjoying it all in his OAvn Avay, but voting everything a bore that broke in upon the routine of his habitual occupations. Of all the distinguishing charac teristics of the land, its marvels of scenery, its antiquities, its works of art, he wras far more ignorant than his wife. Thanks to Mr Murray, she at all events knew what they ought to see, and where it Avas to be found, and she entered upon all their new pursuits Avith a passionate eagerness, that at first some- Avhat disconcerted, though it amused, her husband. He found it rather a trial of pa tience to be dragged off morning after morn ing in quest of pictures or statues, for which he cared nothing, but it Avas impossible not to sympathize with Susan's expressions of admir ation and delight, as each new miracle of genius caught her eye. Her happiness Avas so genuine, her observations so true to nature, so"], [157, "149 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. free from affectation or cant, that by degrees he caught the infection, and flattered himself that under his Avife's tuition he Avas fast imbib ing a taste for art. The progress he made was small, no doubt, but in all probability, under any other mistress, he would have made none at all, for she wTas not only a loving Avife, but a delightful companion, and had the tact to alloAv a subject to drop before it became wearisome. Nor Avas she so totally engrossed by her own favourite pursuits as to find no time or attention to spare for his. She listened with unfeigned interest to all he had to tell of the Avild and adventurous life he had led so long at the Cape, or of his fortnight's residence in an Indian AvigAvam during his sojourn in Canada, subjects on which he was rather fond of dilating. She entered Avith ardour into all his plans for improvements at ThornAvood. She even became, to a certain extent, and theoretically, an adept in the mysteries of Avoodcraft and sporting in all its branches, and above all, she Avas always ready to give up her own wishes for his. For they did clash sometimes ; Sir Hubert Avas very fond of"], [158, "150 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. society, and Lady Marston would have been contented to pass every evening at home, with her husband for all company. Of course, Marston found many acquaintances in the Eternal city, and they were soon engaged in a round of dissipation. Susan submitted Avith a very good grace, though she never took to it kindly. She danced a little when she could not avoid it ; he never missed a single dance if a partner vvas to be had, and, like a man of taste, always selected the most beauti- ful and agreeable. She winced a little oc- casionally, when accident forced upon her notice his devoted manner to the reigning beauty of the hour, but his attentions were so general, so impartially distributed, that it was almost impossible for the most sensitive to take exception to them. It was his manner; he was deservedly such a favourite Avith men and women, and moreover there Avas the consola tory conviction that, however . much he might like to laugh and talk, and even to flirt, en tout Men, tout honncur, Avith others, she Avas still the one preferred ; his heart was hers alone. And yet, notAvithstanding her reluctance to"], [159, "151 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. mix much in general society, had Susan felt inclined to compete with her husband for its triumphs, she Avould have proved a most for midable rival, amongst those, at least, whose good opinion was best Avorth having. Those of her own age, perhaps, felt a little shy of her, for though always ready to promote their pleasures, it was clear she cared but little for them herself. Young as she was, she had made acquaintance with society too late in life to appreciate its various attractions. But on the other hand, her success Avith the elderly members of the community was unbounded. The charms of her conversation, the powers of mind which she evidently possessed \u2014 although never obtrusively display ed \u2014 and Avhich she lost no opportunity of cultivating, were celebrated Avith all the exaggeration of southern enthu siasm. It was so rare to see a young and beautiful woman sitting quietly in the corner of a ball-room, and preferring the conversation of some sedate and grey-haired diplomatist, some celebrated artist, or distinguished littera teur, to the fascinations of the Avaltz or the polka. If Sir Hubert, with his open, joyous"], [160, "152 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. manner, his unbounded hospitality, his avowed love of amusement, and the unrivalled skill Avith which he promoted it, Avas most popular with the idle and pleasure-seeking class, his wife won the respect and admiration of those Avhom she admitted to her intimacy. Between them, what Avith their dinners, their small evening parties, and their crowded balls, it Avas universally acknowledged that their house was one of the pleasantest in Rome. But all things must have an end. Easter came and Avent, and the Marstons made their preparations for instant departure. Susan Avould willingly have lingered on the road, but Marston was so anxious to reach London for the beginning of the season, in order that she might at once take her place in the wTorld of which he was so fond, that she acquiesced Avithout a murmur. Nor Avas this eagerness on his part prompted by selfish motives. Dearly as he loved his wife, he had learnt to be still more proud of her, and she knew it. He wished to present her to his friends, that they might appreciate the excellence of the"], [161, "153 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. choice he had made. Something of this he once let fall. \" Ah, yes,\" she cried, \" and tell them that if indeed I am worth anything, it is to you and to your love I owe it all.\" They hurried through Paris, which they agreed to revisit on some future occasion, and reached London early in May. Susan was presented by Lady Deptford, and was soon involved in a series of balls and parties, which, ere long, wearied her by their want of variety. At Rome, wherever she Avent, she Avas sure of finding agreeable convers ation, or something to interest her mind. In London old and young seemed to be de voted to the same pursuit, that of running a race of dissipation against time. All her old friends, the Windermeres, the Berties \u2014 for Mary Wilmington Avas now married \u2014 the Digbys, expressed in the Avarmest terms the pleasure they felt at having her back amongst them ; but after the first greetings, it Avas only Avith her cousin Lucy that she felt really at home ; the others seemed to be too perpetually"], [162, "154 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. occupied, to find time for more than a flying morning visit, or a few words exchanged upon a stair-case, or in the door-way of some crowded ball-room. Her total want of family con nection in the society to which she now belonged, gave her a feeling of isolation, which the attentions, of which she was the object, could not dispel. No wonder that she soon began to weary of scenes so little con genial to her, and to sigh for the time which would dismiss them to the comparative soli tude of Thornwood. Her only consolation \u2014 and in truth, she needed no other \u2014 Avas, that Hubert was still unchanged. His affection, his solicitude for her comfort, were still the same that they had been in the first days of their married life ; his mornings were devoted to riding or walking with her ; and yet he could not always suppress a movement of im patience, Avhen he noticed her reluctance to accompany him to some great ball or formal dinner-party. Her great passion Avas the opera, and her husband's first care had been to secure for her one of the best boxes in the house ; and by degrees, a tacit understanding"], [163, "155 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. sprung up between them, that on the nights on which she Avent to the theatre, she was to be alloAved to return quietly home after the per formance, Avhile Sir Hubert discharged the duties of both, at any party to which they might have been invited. One there was of her husband's connec tions Avho remained devoted to Aunt Susan. Scarcely a morning passed Avithout Lord Deptford's paying her a visit, if but for a feAv minutes. He was still the same light-hearted being as ever, apparently Avithout a care, or a cloud, to darken the sunshine of his existence. He it was who took upon himself to arrange all their water-parties and pic-nics, their expedi tions to Epsom and Ascot, their dinners at Greenwich or Blackwall ; and when the season came to an end, he did his best to persuade them, though in vain, to join a wildish set, who Avere going to shoot grouse at a moor he had taken in Scotland. He promised to join them at ThoriiAVood as soon as he had killed the last head of game, and had got rid of his com panions. At length, to her infinite delight, Susan and"], [164, "156 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. her husband returned to their oavu home, endeared to her by so many happy recollec tions. A few Aveeks they passed perfectly alone, but with the autumn came a succession of visitors. The Digby s Avere the first to break in upon their solitude, bringing with them a young gentleman, Avith whom Lucy had favoured the Avorld in the course of the preceding Avinter. They paid the Marstons only a flying visit, however, as Lucy, who was not strong, had been advised to pass a couple of months at the sea-side. The long projected tour to Switzerland Avas necessarily adjourned sine die. Mr Baines did not accompany them, symptoms of gout \u2014 so he said, at least \u2014 having most unfortunately made their appearance a few days before. Lucy, Avho in London had seldom seen them together, Avas delighted Avith all she saAV of the good understanding evidently existing between Susan and Sir Hubert, and the happiness they enjoyed. She could not refrain from singing a few notes of triumph at the fortunate result of her com binations ; and Avas a little angry with her"], [165, "157 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. husband for telling her, that it was rather too early for such excessive jubilation. \" It would indeed be strange,\" he said, \" if we found them at daggers-draAving so soon after their marriage. You had better Avait another year at least to judge of the success of your plans. Not that I doubt their future happiness in the least. They are still as much in love with each other as two people can well be, and I see no reason Avhy they should not remain so. I only hope she will not make him too well contented with his lot, and turn him into a mere country squire.\" \" True. I forgot that you mean him to be prime- minister some day or other; and I dare say he Avould make as good a one as anybody else. But confess that you think Susan wonderfully improved.

And so it would to her, too ; for I knoAv there is nothing she desires more anxiously, than your regard and affec tion.\" To the Digbys succeeded Lord and Lady Windermere with his sister, Lady Elizabeth Bertram, the Berties, and Lady Deptford with Edith, accompanied or followed by two or three of her attaches. Amongst these the most re markable w*as Mr Penrhys, one of those useful nondescripts so frequently met with in family circles, who for some years had been admitted to Lady Deptford's intimacy, and was her confidential adviser in all matters of difficulty. What his early career had been no one seemed to knoAV.

Be that as it might, when he was about five or six and twenty, he inherited a considerable property from a distant relative, and forthwith casting his slough, aspired to a more elevated rank, in the social hierarchy. At first with indifferent success ; for his man ners were not particularly refined, and his education had been evidently neglected. He possessed, however, the first element of success \u2014 -a determination to succeed, \u2014 and he saw his perseverance gradually rewarded. Finding his progress slow in London, he betook him self to foreign travel, and at Baden and Flo rence, Rome and Naples, found the means of making several useful acquaintances. At Pisa, on his journey homeAvards, he fell in Avith Lady Deptford, with Avhom he had some slight acquaintance, and was fortunate enough to lay her under obligation. Not long after the death of her husband, she had gone abroad for a year or two with her daughters, and Avas on her return to England, when the roguery of her courier, who had absconded Avith all her ready-money, compelled her to wait at Pisa till she could receive a fresh letter of credit."], [168, "160 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. When Penrhys heard of the circumstance, he instantly offered to be her temporary banker, and though she did not accept the offer, he made himself so generally useful in her nego- tiations Avith the police for the recovery of her property \u2014 which of course led to nothing \u2014 and in tranquillizing the master of the hotel who began to feel anxious for the payment of his little bill, that he developed, for the first time perhaps in her life, a feeling of gratitude in her mind. He remained at Pisa for the few days that elapsed before the arrival of remittances enabled her to continue her journey, and as their route Avas the same they pursued it in company. By degrees, Lady Deptford talked to him Avithout reserve of the various domestic troubles and grievances Avith which she was beset, as a widow Avith a large family and lim- ited means, and, as he was an excellent man of business, Avith plenty of practical good sense, he gave her much valuable advice. By the time they reached London, he had established himself on the most intimate footing, and Avas introduced by her to all her intimates as a friend of the family. Under such auspices he"], [169, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 161 speedily obtained a status in society, and, not being deficient in tact or powers of observation, acquired a varnish of manner which, to a great extent, concealed his innate vulgarity. He became a member of one or two good clubs, and, expanding his vieAvs, sought and obtained a seat in the House of Commons. His parliamentary career was a curious one. He Avas returned pledged to support the ad ministration of the day, and this pledge he amply redeemed. He never made a speech, properly so called. His nature was too over bearing to alloAv him to argue a case or dis cuss a question calmly and dispassionately, but for a cold, cutting sarcasm, an insolent sneer or taunt, an unblushing misstatement of facts, he was unrivalled. He had the knack of put ting his opponents on their defence. More than once he had contrived to turn an incon venient question of public interest into one of a personal nature. More than once he had silenced an adversary, Avhom he could not answer, by an impudent denial of the data on which that adversary's argument was founded. The government at that time Avas in rather V0_. II. 11"], [170, "162 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. a shaky condition, and they thought it good policy to convert so useful a partisan into a faithful ally by the bonds of interest. Penrhys wras made a member of one of the many boards by which the affairs of this country are so happily administered. But his chiefs Avere not long in discovering the mistake they had made. Penrhys accepted office, but he did not accept the passive obedience which is supposed to be its necessary concomitant. There was no holding him or his tongue under restraint. If conciliation was the order of the day, Pen- rhys Avas certain to say something, that blew up the embers of discord into a flame. If by mutual concessions there was a chance of car- rying some useful measure, he Avas sure to reproach the opposite party for their inconsist- ency, in consenting to a violation of the prin- ciples upon which they professed to act. Nor could he always refrain from a sly cut at his OAvn party, Avhen they appeared to him to be lukeAvarm, or remiss in the good cause. In short, he was soon known as an \" impracticable man,\" full of crotchets and dangerous fancies. This could not last long. On occasion of a"], [171, "163 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. slight modification of the ministry, he received an intimation that his resignation would be ac cepted. Since that time he had enacted to the life the part of an independent member of Parliament, railing at his quondam colleagues, abusing his enemies, showering on all alike, Avith praiseworthy impartiality, the envenomed shafts of his rather coarse eloquence. Some there were Avho affected to be rather scandalized by the close companionship which existed betAveen Mr Penrhys and Lady Dept ford ; but that lady's conduct, even in youth, had been irreproachably correct, and the cen sorious gossip soon died a natural death. A more probable supposition Avas that the liaison Avould end in marriage, and probably Mr Penrhys himself contemplated some such con summation. But years passed away Avithout bringing any change in their relations. Mr Penrhys was still the bosom counsellor, the indispensable man, but he Avas not Lady Deptford's husband. But in every other respect he acted as Pater familias. He called the children by their Christian names, lectured the girls, and repri-"], [172, "164 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. manded the boys, earning, as a natural conse quence, their unmitigated detestation, \u2014 silent and inert on the part of Cecilia and Mary, active and defiant on the part of Edith and her brothers. At the time of Mr Penrhys' first introduction into the family, Lord Dept ford was a boy at school, and, as he frequently passed his holidays aAvay from home, he saw but little of Avhat Avas going on, but he heard enough to make him indignant at what he Avas pleased, somewhat irreverently, to term his mother's inexcusable Aveakness; and he lost no opportunity of proving to the interloper that he, at all events, Avould not submit to his authority. The only cause of dissension that ever arose between Lady Deptford and her eldest son Avas on account of the privy-coun cillor and domestic adviser. When Sir Hubert settled in London, after his return to England, he AAras speedily intro duced to this intimate friend of his sister. He did not particularly admire his new ac qaintance, notAvithstanding the extreme defer ence with Avhich Mr Penrhys treated him ; but when that gentleman requested him to go over"], [173, "165 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Lady Deptford's accounts and the details of her domestic economy, he could not but acknow ledge that everything Avas in perfect order, and that in that respect, at least, Penrhys' clear head and habits of business had been of im mense service to her. Still, Sir Hubert was not inclined to treat him on the footing of one of the family. He had declined inviting him to his wedding, but, as a sort of compromise, he had allowed Susan to ask him occasionally to her parties during the past season, and gave him an invitation to Thornwood, much to the gratification of his sister, and the disgust of her daughters. On the eve of Lady Deptford's arrival, Marston though it advisable to give his Avife a hint or tAvo for her guidance. \" Emily is an excellent person in many Avays,\" he said, \" but she is a little too fond of managing, especially here, where she has so long had her oavii Avay. As long as I Avas single, that was all very well, but noAv that I have a wife to take care of me, it is to her I look for making us all comfortable. You are the mistress of Thornwood, and are perfectly"], [174, "166 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. competent to govern your own household. Digby was quite astonished at your genius in that line. He said he believed yours to be the best-ordered establishment in England; and Digby, in his bachelor-days, had plenty of opportunities of judging. You stand in need of no suggestions, and if any changes are proposed, perhaps you had better say that, as we settled all our domestic arrangements to gether, you do not like to make any alteration Avithout consulting me. My sister is a woman of sense, and Avill understand a demi mot.\" And with Lady Deptford's arrival the strug gle began. In London she had not found her sister-in-laAv quite as docile as she had expected, and she thought the present a good opportu nity for establishing her supremacy. As soon as the kissing demonstrations Avere over, Susan proposed to conduct her guest to the apart ment prepared for her. \" Quite needless, my dear Susan,\" said the latter. \" I Iciioav Thornwood Avell enough to find my way to my own room in the dark.\" \" But, dear Lady Deptford, it is not your"], [175, "167 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. old room. We have taken that suite for our selves.\" \" Not my old room ! Very extraordinary, and very inconvenient, I must say. The sit ting-room attached to it is the best in the house. I always used to pass the mornings there with my children. Is this Hubert's doing ? \" \" I conclude so. At least he installed me there on our arrival, and Avhen I had been over the house, I decided on remaining where I Avas. But I hope you AArill be comfortable where I have put you. It is Sir Charles's old apartment. Allow me to show it you.\" Lady Deptford was thoroughly out of hu mour, Avhich was a case of rare occurrence, and she shoAved it, Avhich was still rarer. At din ner she found fault with everything, scolded the servants, snubbed her daughters, and talked at Susan. Perhaps she expected to re establish her authority, by opening Hubert's eyes to his wife's inexperience and consequent deficiencies. If so, she signally failed, and warned by her brother's look of annoyance at"], [176, "168 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. the pertinacity of her attacks, she at length let the subject drop for the present. In the draAving-room, however, she made one more desperate attempt for victory. On her ringing the bell, the butler brought in coffee. \" I rang for coals,\" she said, \" we are not ready for coffee. Take it doAvn, and bring it in when the gentlemen leave the dining-room.\" The servant was preparing to obey, when Lady Marston said quietly, \"Bring some coals, Kemp, but put down the coffee, and when I ring, bring some more.\" The one was so evidently bent on aggres sion, and the other on resistance, that the rest of the party looked at each other in mute astonishment. Edith, who had established her right to dine down-stairs, Avas the first to break silence. \" I thought, Mamma, you liked your coffee directly after dinner. I am sure I do.\" Miss Edith Avould have better consulted her own interest by holding her tongue. \" I do not approve of your taking coffee in the evening at all,\" said her mother, angrily, \" and I desire you will not do it. When I"], [177, "169 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. was a girl, I was never allowed to touch it till I came out. Not, indeed, till I was married.\" \"What an inducement to commit matri mony ! \" exclaimed Lady Elizabeth Bertram. \" I confess I consider coffee as the necessary supplement to a dinner, and I Avas in despair Avhen I heard it ordered away.\" Lady Elizabeth was just then a great favourite of Lady Deptford, who thought that with her sixty thousand pounds she was the very wife for her son. She encouraged their intimacy in every possible way, and, as far as appearances went, with success. But it was appearance only. Lady Elizabeth was on the best possible terms with Lord Deptford, as became such near connections, but she had not the slightest intention of taking him for better and Avorse ; and on this point a perfect understanding existed betAveen the two. In fact, they had more than once made merry together over Lady Deptford's rather trans parent man\u0153uvring. \" But for heaven's sake,\" said his lordship, \" do nothing to destroy my poor, dear mother's illusion. She is so bent on pro-"], [178, "170 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. viding me Avith a rich wife, that she Avould lose no time in starting some other quarry.\" And with this request Lady Elizabeth, who was rather amused by the present state of affairs, graciously promised compliance. Consequently, Lady Deptford was not un deceived, and she arrived at Thornwood in the happy conviction that everything was going on as Avell as possible. The only draw back Avas that that tiresome Deptford would remain daAvdling on in Scotland, instead of joining the party at the Priory; but as he very judiciously threw the blame on his guests \u2014 one of them being his colonel \u2014 who would remain, whether he wished it or not, she Avas obliged to content herself with bewailing this disappointment to Lady Elizabeth, who grati fied her maternal heart by acknowledging that it Avas very provoking. As Lady Elizabeth, therefore, was lady of the ascendant, Lady Deptford no sooner heard her express her opinion on the vexed coffee-question, than she said, \" My dear Elizabeth, why did you not say so at once ? I should never have thought of sending it away.\""], [179, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 171 \"I had no time. Lady Marston, like an amiable hostess, anticipated my wishes, as she is no doubt anticipating yours at the present moment.\" Lady Deptford turned her head, and saw Susan standing by her side, with a cup of coffee and the sugar basin. \" Do you take sugar, Lady Deptford?\" she asked. \" My dear Susan, I am really shocked,\" she replied, surprised into good breeding. \" Why did you not tell Edith to bring it me ? \" Soon after, she went up-stairs, taking Edith with her. \" My dear Susan,\" said Lady Elizabeth, as soon as the two had left the room, \" Avhy, instead of saying, ' Do you take sugar ? ' did you not use the more classical phrase, ' Will you allow me to sAveeten you ? ' \" Lady Bertie laughed, Susan could not re press a smile, but Lady Windermere looked scandalized. \" Elizabeth ! \" she said, in a tone of reproof. \" Well. Here I am. Say on, O Countess.\" \" You ought not to speak of mamma in that way ; before us at all events.\""], [180, "172 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \"If I were inclined to quibble,\" rejoined Lady Elizabeth, \"I might reply that I had not said a Avord of mamma ; that I had merely expressed a predilection for one form of speech rather than for another. But I like to be honest, and I will openly avow that I was very glad to see Susan resist the attempt to take the management of her awn house out of her own hands. I am sure we ought all to be very much obliged to her for the ex ample she set us ; you and Mary, as already enjoying matronly honours, and I, as hoping to do so some day or other.\" Lady Deptford made no more attempts of a similar nature. She felt that she wras fight ing not only against Susan, but against her brother. Moreover, Mr Penrhys strongly advised her against such trials of strength for the present. \" Just noAV,\" he said, \" Sir Hubert is entirely devoted to his Avife. If you wish to regain your ascendancy over him, Avait pa tiently till this hot fit has had time to cool. Then open his eyes gradually and gently to any defects you may observe in her. If, as"], [181, "173 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. you say, she is deficient in all knowledge of the Avorld and the usages of society, you will have the game in your own hands, writh so fastidious a man as your brother seems to be.\" But though she refrained from all open attacks, Lady Deptford felt something very like aversion for the sister-in-laAv whom she had never loved, Avhom she had intended to lead and mould according to her* own vieAvs, and Avho declined to be so led and moulded. Numberless were the little annoyances con trived with a view to thwart and irritate her, but Susan, sensitive in the highest degree, Avhere those whose regard she prized Avere concerned, Avas cold as marble as regarded the dislike of those, AAdiose affection or friendship AArere to her a matter of indifference. All Lady Deptford's attempts to disturb her equanimity Avere made in vain ; and Avhen she perceived their drift, she Avas rather amused by them, and met them with imperturbable good-humour. Her only dread Avas lest her husband should perceive them, for he Avould have treated them in a very different manner ; but they Avere seldom ventured on in his"], [182, "174 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. presence. Sometimes Lady Deptford Avould expatiate on the admirable way in which Caroline Marston had ruled her establishment, broadly insinuating that things were much better managed in her day than at present. Susan Avinced a little at first, for she was not yet hardened to Caroline's name, but she answered quietly, that as she had the same servants avIio Avere in the house in Sir Charles's time, she hoped with more experience to do as well. Once, Lady Deptford, after inviting her in a very affectionate manner to come and sit doAvn by her on the sofa, round which the rest of the party Avas congregated, asked her for particulars of her birth, parentage, and early life, \" For, my dear Susan, I am ashamed to say I know very little about it.\" \" You surprise me, Lady Deptford,\" Avas the reply ; \" for I remember your giving Lord Windermere's mother a very full and particu lar account of my belongings, relating even particulars of which I was myself ignorant. You know who my father was, you know who my mother Avas, and that till my poor father's death I lived in his house. After that I went"], [183, "175 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. to live with my friend Mrs Tindal. If you wish for any further information, and will specify it, I will endeavour to satisfy you. \" But this did not suit Lady Deptford. That there was some mystery in her sister-in-law's early career, she suspected ; but, though she would have given much to penetrate it, she had no Avish to make others as wise as herself. Her only object had been to embarrass Susan ; but she did not venture to persevere when she caught her brother's eye fixed upon her. He had entered the room unnoticed by her, and as she stood in a sort of dread of him, she allowed the subject to drop. On another occasion she took upon herself to dispose of Susan's horse. A pic-nic had been proposed to some hill possessed of a grotto, one of the wonders of the county, at some distance from Thornwood ; and Lady Elizabeth Bertram Avas regretting that her OAvn horse, for Avhich she had Avritten, Avas not yet arrived. \" But, my dear, there is Susan's horse. I am sure she Avill be delighted to lend it you, and accompany me in the carriage.\""], [184, "176 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Take Susan's horse, and expose myself to her hatred and ill-will for the rest of my days ! At least, that is what I should feel for any one who deprived me of Roland. Confess, Susan, you would put poison in my tea before the pic-nic comes off, if I Avere to listen for a mo ment to Lady Deptford's proposal.\" \"No, indeed,\" said Lady Marston, \"you need not fear anything of the sort. I confess, as a rule, I should not like to lend my horse, but you are one of the very few to whom I can truly say \u2014 ' You are welcome to him.' So let us consider that as settled.\" And it Avas a real sacrifice she was making, for she was very fond of riding. Her husband Avas sure to ride himself, and the prospect of a long drive with Lady Deptford Avas hardly sufficient compensation. But her good genius, in the shape of Sir Hubert, again stepped in. He put a positive veto on the proposed arrangement. \" I will find a horse for you, Lady Eliza beth,\" he said, \" if your own do not arrive in time ; but I do not wish any one to ride Susan's horse but herself.\""], [185, "177 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" But Elizabeth is such a perfect horse woman, Hubert,\" exclaimed his sister. \" She is ; and I am sure she Avill find the horse I shall provide for her the very thing to suit her. I have had tAvo of my OAvn broken iii to carry a lady, and she shall take her choice.\" Lady Elizabeth professed herself perfectly satisfied ; and, indeed, as long as she had a good horse under her, it was all she asked ; but she Avas not the less grateful to Susan for her acquiescence in Lady Deptford's proposal. Nor could she refrain from expressing her admiration of Marston. \" I really think,\" she said, Avhen alone Avith Susan, \" that Sir Hubert is as near perfection as a man can ever hope to be. Don't be jealous, but I am half in love with him my self. I only hope, whenever I have a hus band, that he Avill take my defence as effectu ally as your husband does for you. Most men seem ashamed of taking part with their wives.\" \" Hubert Avould take the part of any one who wanted assistance. He really seems to VOL.

Is it possible, my dear Susan, that you think there is anything serious in our very innocent flirtation ! \" \" Well, it is a very general opinion, and if I am wrong, I am wrong in good com- pany.\" \" You are wrong, I assure you. It suits him to devote himself to me in society ; and as he is very amusing and conversable, it suits me to accept his devotion. But we under stand each other perfectly. In fact, we have had a private explanation on the subject. Only, this is a profound secret, so do not betray us.\" \" If this is really the case, I can only say I am very sorry for it. I like Deptford so much, and think so highly of him. All he wants is steadying. And I am sure I should like you for a niece.\" \" Like me as a friend ; for unless I marry Charlie some ten years hence, you will never have me for a niece. And, to tell you the"], [187, "179 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. truth, I have an idea that Lord Deptford is already engaged, or in love, or something of that sort ; and, most assuredly, I am not the object of his preference.\" \" Who is it, then ? \" \" Ah, that is more than I can tell. I have sometimes thought it Avas that pretty Fanny Digby.\" \" Impossible. He has not seen her more than tAvice or three times.\" \" Then it must be some one else ; for I am sure I am right, as you will see in time.\""], [188, "180 CHAPTER VIII. Two or three days of rain compelled a postponement of the pic-nic ; but at length a brilliant October sun ushered in one of those warm, genial days Avhich occasionally gild the departure of a late summer. The season was so far advanced that it Avas thought unwise to risk disappointment by any further delay, and preparations for the expedition Avere made in all haste. Fortunately, Lady Elizabeth's horse had arrived, and the Thornwood stables were sufficiently strong in cavalry to mount the Avhole party, which consisted of those Avho have already been named, Mr Frank Marston, a distant cousin of Sir Hubert, and a Mr Snod grass, a nephew of the rector, Avho had been"], [189, "181 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. invited to join the party, of which, by virtue \u25a0of his local knowledge, he was requested to assume the direction. Lady Deptford de clined joining them, having a wholesome dread of the various ills to which a damp grotto and a luncheon in the open air at that time of year might conduce. She was very much tempted to make Edith remain at home \"to, keep her company ; but the young lady pleaded so hard to be alloAved to go with the rest, and her entreaties were so warmly backed by them, that, at last, permission was granted, on condition of her going in the carriage which conveyed the servants and provisions, under the tutelage of Mr Penrhys, that worthy gentleman having declined the offer of a mount. It is needless to say that this pro viso deprived her mother's concession of much of its value, particularly when the carriage in question turned out to be the omnibus. When Edith found herself installed in it for a ten miles drive, Avith a man Avhom she feared and detested, she thought that she had almost rather have stayed at home. But it is aston ishing at Avhat an early age the cunning of"], [190, "182 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. the female mind is developed. As soon as her companion had settled himself into a corner, and taken the Times out of his pocket, a bright idea struck her. Her features re laxed into a pleasing smile, and she began to chatter with the volubility of a nest of mag pies. It Avas one incessant, \" Oh, Mr Pen rhys, look at that hill ; Oh, Mr Penrhys, look at that oak ; that hare ; that shepherd's dog ;\" till the poor man crumpled up his paper in despair. Then she assumed a little Avise look, and asked if there was any news. \" How can I possibly tell, Edith, when you are talking to me without ceasing ? \" was the reply of her victim. \" I am so sorry, but I never can keep quiet on a party of pleasure. Don't you think it Avould be a good thing if I Avere to go outside, because I could see so much better, and you Avould be so much more comfortable alone ? \" These tAvo last propositions were undeni able ; but then there was the case of con science. What Avould Lady Deptford say to this way of discharging his trust ? While he was still debating this knotty point in his own"], [191, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 183 mind, the carriage drew up on one side to alloAv the cavalcade to pass. Marston and Lady Elizabeth were the two last, and Pen rhys made a sign to them to stop. \" Sir Hubert, Edith is very anxious to go outside, as she sees nothing of the country here; do you think it will be safe for her?\" Edith made the most frantic gestures to indicate to her uncle that he Avas to say \"yes.\" The coachman was an old, steady servant; and Kemp, the butler, who was seated beside him on the box, had been in the family for the last thirty years: \"Do you think, James,\" said Marston, \"that you and Kemp can contrive to take Miss Edith between you ? It is dull for her, poor child, being shut up in a a close carriage this lovely day.\" The exchange Avas effected Avithout diffi culty ; and Marston and his companion gal loped on to overtake the rest of the party. At a turn of the road, Lady Elizabeth looked back. \" What Avill you bet that Mr Penrhys arrives safe and sound ? \" she said."], [192, "184 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Sir Hubert looked round also, and saAv Miss Edith in possession of the reins. \"James will take very good care of her,\" he replied, laughing. \" She has a very pretty turn for driving, and always used to make me give her the ' ribbons,' to use her own expres sion, when we were out together. I only hope poor Penrhys is not aware of the honour she is doing him.\" He wras not. She had just inveigled the coachman into betraying his trust, as her late companion was reading the last lines of a most eloquent letter from Pater-familias to the Editor of the Times, deploring the fast habits of the young ladies of the present day. \" A capital letter ! \" he said to himself. \" Fortunately for Lady Deptford, none of her daughters \" Here his soliloquy was broken short by a tremendous jolt, succeeded by half-a-dozen heavy lurches, strongly resembling the motion of a boat breasting a succession of short seas. \" Anything the matter, coachman ? \" he asked, thrusting his head out of the Avindow."], [193, "185 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" No, sir ; only we have turned out of the road noAV, to take the lane.\" He did not think it necessary to add that, in performing this evolution,' the carriage had been driven against the stump of a gate-post ; and that, in rectifying this error of judgment, Miss Edith had turned the horses directly across the lane, which was full of ruts, and, but for James's guiding hand, Avould have landed the omnibus in the ditch on the other side. \" Hadn't you better let James take the reins uoav, Miss, in this awkAvard lane ? \" suggested Kemp, in a state of considerable alarm for the safety of his own person, and that of the good things committed to his charge. But Miss did not even condescend to ansAver. \" Tavo horses are not enough for this heavy drag,\" she said to the coachman. \" Why did you not take four ? I should so like to drive four-in-hand ! \" \" Sir Hubert only ordered a pair, Miss.\""], [194, "186 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" That is because he did not know what a bad road it is. I shall speak to him about it another time.\" Contrary to all reasonable expectation they arrived in safety, Edith having acquired much valuable information respecting the natural history of the horse, its habits and peculiarities, Avhile Mr Penrhys remained in a state of blissful ignorance as to the jeopardy in which he had been placed. They found Lady Marston and Frank waiting for them on a sort of natural laAvn, covered with patches of gorse and broom, shaded here and there by the foliage of a few venerable oaks, covered Avith ivy, and still majestic in their decay. Beyond them, and at a short distance, rose the hill, in Avhich the grotto \u2014 the ostensible object of their pilgrimage \u2014 Avas situated, towards Avhich the rest of the party Avere sauntering. The horses had been sent to a small road-side inn, kept by the farmer who was the tenant of the land adjoining. If the truth must be told, her ladyship was a little discomposed by the exclusive attention which Sir Hubert had thought proper to bestow on Lady Elizabeth"], [195, "187 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. during their ride; and, as a slight mark of displeasure, had volunteered to remain as a guide for Edith and her companion. Frank Marston, a young man of twenty, just fresh from college, insisted upon keeping her com pany, and forced her into an animated conversation, in which, hoAA'ever, he bore the principal share. As soon as Edith descended from her pride of place, she pounced upon her cousin, and insisted upon his running a race with her to the farthest oak, Avhich to her intense delight she Avon, Mr Frank, either intentionally or by accident, stumbling and falling over a root that lay in his way. Susan was thus left to a tete-a-tete Avith Mr Penrhys, who exerted himself to the utmost to make himself agree able; no difficult task, under ordinary circum stances, for one who had seen much, was full of anecdote, and talked well. Lady Marston listened, at first listlessly, and then Avith interest. She knew that he Avas an object of dislike to her nieces, but as it seemed to be purely a matter of personal feeling, for which they Avere not able to assign any better reason"], [196, "188 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. than their mother's partiality for him, it had not much effect upon her ; especially as her husband frequently spoke of him as having shoAvn great judgment in the arrangement of Lady Deptford's affairs. She did not, it is true, much court his society, but she often took his defence Avhen she thought him un justly attacked, always treated him, as her guest, with the most scrupulous attention and civility, and somehow, on the present occasion, she felt even more kindly disposed toAvards him than usual. Perhaps, an indistinct feeling of loneliness made her feel grateful to one, Avho was doing his best to amuse her. When they came up with the rest of the party, they found Lady Elizabeth vehemently discussing with Frank Marston the merits of the last boat-race between Oxford and Cam bridge, on Avhich she had lost gloves by the dozens ; and the others gathered round Mr Snodgrass, who Avas endeavouring to excite their curiosity by a description of the Avonders they Avere to see. But in point of fact, the grotto Avas an imposture, an arrant humbug, useful, indeed, as an object for an expedition,"], [197, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 189 but evidently made by hands, and that at no very distant period, without a stalactite, Avith out even the slightest vestige of maiden-hair. Their exploring was soon concluded, and when they again emerged into the open air, they saAv luncheon set out for them and waiting their pleasure. \" My love,\" said Marston, taking Susan's ami under his, \" how tired you look ! I am afraid this long ride has been too much for you.\" He spoke so fondly that the tears rose to her eyes. \" Oh, Hubert, do you indeed care if I am tired or not ? \" \" Care if you are tired or not ! \" he ex claimed, in astonishment. \" What on earth should I care for, if it is not your A\\rell-being and happiness ! What put such an idea into your head ? \" \" I thought\u2014 I thought that, perhaps, while you Avere riding Avith Lady Elizabeth, you had not time to think of me.\" They were the last of the party. \" My own silly darling,\" he said, kissing her, un perceived as he hoped, though in this he"], [198, "190 SIR HUBERT MARSTON reckoned Avithout his host, for Mr Kemp witnessed the Avhole proceeding, but Kemp was discretion itself. \" My own Susan, if I had Avished to forget you, Lady Elizabeth would not have allowed me, for I think I may say you Avere the sole subject of our convers ation. I cannot tell you all she said of you, but it is impossible for any one to speak more highly of another than she did of you, and she congratulated me most warmly on having secured such a wife.\" \" Dear Elizabeth ! I own I wras a little envious of her happiness, in having you all to herself, but I shall never grudge it her again.\" They had not long taken their places, when Frank Marston exclaimed, \" Who on earth is that coming at such a pace ? It must be a messenger for you, Hubert.\" They all looked in the direction to AArhich he pointed, and sure enough a man on horse back Avas seen riding furiously toAvards them. A stiff hedge separated the meadow in which they Avere seated from the field across which the horseman was galloping, the only mode of"], [199, "191 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. egress being over a tremendous hog-backed stile, Avith a drop of some five or six feet. It was one of those places which the more you look at, the less you like it, and this was probably the opinion of the rider, who prepared to charge it at once. Just as the horse came up to it, having probably more judgment than his master, or a greater regard for his limbs, he swerved ; and Lady Elizabeth exclaimed, \" Lord Deptford ! \" \" What sharp eyes you have, Elizabeth ! \" said Lady Marston, laughing. Their voices probably reached Lord Dept ford, for he took off his hat as he turned the horse round to put him again at the stile. \" Deptford, sure enough,\" said Sir Hubert, \" and on Norman, my best hunter.\" Again they came at it. Norman Avould have refused a second time had he dared, but he kneAV better. His rider had him Avell in hand, and finding no help for it, he took it gallantly, but not being prepared for the drop fell on his knees. Susan hid her face in her hands ; the rest started up ; but Deptford re covered his horse in a moment, and then dis-"], [200, "192 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. mounting, gave him to the servants. \" I heard from my lady-mother,\" he said, as he ap proached, \"where you all were, so I persuaded Philpotts to let me have one of the hunters, and here I am.\" \" After doing your best to break your own neck, and my horse's back,\" retorted his uncle. \"There's gratitude for you, Aunt Susan. Norman will never refuse timber again, I'll answer for it.\" \" We shall see the week after next, when hunting begins in earnest.\" \" Good Heavens, Hubert,\" said Lady Mars ton, \" you would never think of leaping that stile!\" \" Well, no, I think not. I should have se lected the fence.\" \" Oh, that's all very well for you heavy weights Avho can crush through anything,\" said Lord Deptford, \" but I should have been left suspended in the middle of the hedge, like a spread-eagle. But where am I to sit ? Of course you have kept a place for me by you, Lady Elizabeth, when you knew I Avas com- ing.\""], [201, "193 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" KneAV you were coming ! How Avas I to knoAv you were coming ? \" \" Your heart must have told you so. If it did not, I advise you to discharge it on the spot.\" \" Oh, I left my heart locked up at home with mamma's diamonds. But come, we will try to make room for you between Mr Penrhys and me.\" \" Ah, Mr Penrhys, Iioav are you ? \" said Lord Deptford, magnanimously shaking hands with his foe. The pic-nic Avent off very successfully; every body Avas in high good-humour, and after the first glass or two of champagne even Penrhys found an unusual feeling of amiability pervad ing his frame. His wit lost its dry, caustic tone, and he condescended to compliment Lord Deptford on his riding. \" Not that my opinion,\" he said, with the humility so near akin to pride, \"is of much value, for I know nothing of horsemanship, except what I saw as a lad at Astley's, and that, I presume, Avould not be of much use to a man in the hunting-field.\" VOL. II. 13"], [202, "194 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \"Not much,\" rejoined Sir Hubert, \"but did you never ride yourself? \" \" Never. When young, I had to work hard, and when I found myself an independent man, it was too late. In my opinion there is no thing so ridiculous as a man's attempting to do what he is sure to fail in. In consequence, I never ride and I never dance, for I should do both badly, and I am too old to learn.\" It Avas said so quietly, and Avith so much apparent candour, that even those who most disliked him were conscious of a sort of good will towards him at the moment, \\A_iile Susan felt really pleased. \" You must not despair, Mr Penrhys,\" she said, \" or you will discourage me, for I am but an apprentice myself in both these ac complishments.\" \" There is some difference in our ages, I am sorry to say, Lady Marston.\" The horses and carriage now made their appearance. \" Come,\" said Sir Hubert, \" it is time for us to be off. The days are getting short, and we shall not have more light than Ave require. Edith, remember you are to go home inside."], [203, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 195 You had plenty of opportunity for studying the country on your way here, and the afternoons are chilly.\" \" Oh, Hubert, I am so Avell wrapped up, and I hate the inside.\" \" Never mind, Edith,\" said Lady Winder mere, \" I am a little tired myself, and Avill go with you and Mr Penrhys. I suppose one of the servants can take my horse home.\" \" And mine too,\" chimed in Lady Marston. \" I feel as if I had had riding enough for to day. Will anybody else join us ? \" \" Certainly not,\" exclaimed Lord Deptford. *' Lady Elizabeth much prefers riding home with me. Perhaps, though, Mary may be tired of Bertie's company.\" But, apparently, Mary Avas not, for she al lowed Sir Richard to put her on her horse, and then take his place by her side, Avith great resignation. The rest of the gentlemen then mounted, and they Avere all soon galloping homewards, fohWed by the omnibus and its inmates. As soon as they were fairly under way, Edith took complete possession of her sister, and whispering to her, \" Let us get away from"], [204, "196 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. that horrid man,\" drew her to the furthest end of the omnibus, and forthwith began in a low tone of voice describing to her all the adven tures of her morning drive, much to the amusement of LadyWimdermere, vvho laughed and lectured by turns. Thus left to themselves, with the prospect of a long drive before them, both Susan and her companion felt it incumbent upon them to do their best to be entertaining. The convers ation naturally turned at first upon the inci dents of the day, but it soon slid into more interesting topics. Penrhys, remembering some of Lady Deptford's hints, had a mind to test the extent of Susan's knowledge or ignorance in the usual branches of female education. With consummate art he examined her, Avith out her being conscious of it, in the various departments of history and general literature; and he Avas not long in arriving at the conclu sion that, if not deeply read, she Avas thoroughly mistress of those particular subjects to which her attention had been directed. There was nothing superficial about her ; what she knew, she knew well. He Avas also not a little as tonished at the readiness with which her strong,"], [205, "197 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. though only partially cultivated, intellect de tected and refuted some common-place soph isms, to which he had recourse for the purpose of drawing her out. Superiority of mental poAver, combined with beauty of form, Avas the god of his idolatry, \u2014 the only one he acknow ledged, the only one to which he bent the knee, \u2014 and it was with something like a sigh that he said to himself, \"Ah, if I had the training of that mind, Avhat a magnificent, what a glorious creature I Avould make of her. Is it possible that she can love a man like Mar ston, Avho never rises above the animal instincts of our nature \u2014 eating, drinking, shooting, and hunting ! Bah ! What a fool I am ! He had a great position in the Avorld, and she had not. He offered to share his Avith her, and Avoman-like, she accepted. But I must find out more about her.\" \"Are you fond of dancing, Lady Marston?\" he asked abruptly. The question startled her ; it had so little to do with the last topics of their convers ation. \" Yes,\" she replied, after a moment's pause, \u2022' ' I like it well enough ; but I think I should"], [206, "198 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. like it better if \" she stopped. She had been going to say, \"if I could sometimes dance with Hubert,\" but she thought it un necessary to take a comparative stranger into her confidence. \"If?\" he asked. \" I. was going to say\" \u2014 and she coloured as she spoke \u2014 \" if I could always be sure of having agreeable partners.\" \" Can that be meant as a hint for me ? \" was the thought that flitted across his mind ; and his vanity almost made him offer to put himself under her tuition that evening \u2014 for they got up a dance almost every night at ThoriiAvood \u2014 but a timely recollection of Cardinal Richelieu's sarabande restrained him. \" That is quite sufficient answer to my question,\" he said aloud. \" How so?\" \" Why, if some of our friends, whom I could name, had been asked the question, they would have answered 'Yes, if they could always be sure of good partners.' You say ' agreeable partners,' from Avhich I infer that you like dancing rather as a means of society than for the thing itself.\""], [207, "199 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. When they arrived at the Priory, they Avere both surprised to find how rapidly the time had passed. Mr Penrhys got out, and pre pared to hand out his companions ; but Avith Lady Marston, at least, he was forestalled. Sir Hubert, Avho had arrived some time before them, wTas waiting at the hall-door, and as soon as he saAV his wife in the act of stepping from the carriage, took her in his arms and lifted her down. Something there Avas in this familiar action that so disturbed Mr Penrhys' serenity, that he walked straight into the house, Avithout troubling himself fur ther about Lady Windermere and her sister. Luckily for them, Marston happened to turn round, and hastened to their assistance. \" Did you ever see such rudeness ? \" said Lady Windermere ; \"to leave us to scramble out as we could.\" \" What have you and Edith been doing to him ? \" inquired Marston. \" Doing ! Nothing. We have not ex changed a Avord Avith him \u2014 good, bad, or indifferent. Indeed, Ave had not an oppor tunity ; he and Susan were flirting so desper ately.\""], [208, "200 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Poor Susan ! \" said Marston, laughing. \" She must indeed be hard put to it for admirers, if she admits Mr Penrhys' name on the list. But come up-stairs, both of you, and have some tea. I know it is ready in her room; and we shall not dine these two hours.\" To this symposium only the elect were ad mitted. Strictly speaking, according to the rules laid down by Lady Marston, the male sex ought to have been represented solely by the husbands of those ladies, who Avere so fortunate as to possess that appendage to their state ; but on the present occasion, Lord Deptford Avas discovered demurely seated at the tea-table, when Susan led the Avay to her boudoir. \" Now, Lord Deptford,\" she said, \" this is a great deal too bad, and I Avill not alloAV it. I admit only steady, married men here, so pray take your departure.\" \" But I am married secretly, so I have a right to remain.\" \" Not at all. We do not recognize secret marriages. Besides, to give you a right to stay, your Avife ought to be present too.\""], [209, "201 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Hoav do you knoAv she is not ? Lady Elizabeth, will not you intercede for me?\" \" Not I. What Avould your incognita Avife say if I did ? \" \"Noav, Aunt Susan,\" he said, throwing himself on his knees before her, \" be good natured, and I promise to marry as soon as I find any one Avho will have me, provided I like her Avell enough to ask her.\" \" What is to be done ? \" said Susan. \" We will put it to the vote.\" Lady Elizabeth voted for turning him out without further ceremony ; but the others were more lenient, and he obtained permission to remain, on condition of making himself par ticularly agreeable, and generally useful. He accepted these terms Avith alacrity, and, by his own account, fulfilled them in the most exem plary manner. In the mean time, Mr Snodgrass \u2014 who Avas to dine and sleep at the Priory \u2014 and Frank Marston, in order to Avhile away the time be fore dinner, ordered the billiard-table to be lighted up, and were soon deep in the mysteries of jennies and cannons. Mr Penrhys, left to his oAvn devices, retired to his OAvn room, and"], [210, "202 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. threw himself wearily on the sofa, as if in clined to take a nap. But, though his eyes were closed, he never felt less disposed to sleep in his life. On three things he especi ally prided himself: \u2014 that he had never been drunk ; that he had never lost a shilling at a game of chance ; and that he had never been in love. Not that he was insensible of the power of beauty. On the contrary, perhaps no one appreciated it more, but it was in an artistic point of view. He looked upon a beautifid woman in the same light that he looked upon a beautiful statue, or some master-piece of painting. His admiration was excited ; emotion there Avas none. He could criticise in detail every perfection of face and figure, but his head remained cool, his pulse beat steadily as ever. And yet, beneath this seemingly phlegmatic tempera ment ran a strong under-current of passion, or rather, sensuality, which no idle scruples re strained him from gratifying. He was clever ; he was, undoubtedly, good-looking, and took immense pains with his personal appearance ; he Avas still what we sexagenarians call young \u2014 that is to say, he Avas under forty ; he had"], [211, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 203 made a profound study of all the Aviles and stratagems by which the female heart is Avon ; and, as he spared no trouble to insure suc cess, he was very frequently successful. It is true his conquests Avere almost exclusively confined to the lower or middle classes of society, and being of rather a capricious na ture, in such matters at least, it was seldom long before he abandoned his victims to their fate, with as little ceremony as remorse. It was his boast, that he had never alloAved his heart to play traitor to his head ; that he had obtained such perfect control over his feelings, as to enable him to crush in the bud any in cipient tenderness for woman, or friendship for man. He looked upon them all but as so many instruments for ministering to his pleasures, or promoting his interests. As these opinions, however, were not exactly cal culated to gain him the confidence of those with whom he had to deal, they were kept carefully concealed within the sanctuary of his OAvn breast. Nor did he, even now, intend to make an exception to these general rules in Susan's favour, although he felt himself more poAver-"], [212, "204 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. fully attracted to her than had ever been the case before. Perhaps, it Avas this very feeling which set him on his guard, and induced him to remain faithful to his old system. But he thought that he had at last discovered in her the very being, who could aid him in his plans of self-advancement ; wdiile, at the same time, she would throw a newr charm over his existence. In her he saAv great intelligence united to beauty of no ordinary character, \u2014 a mind still unformed, and therefore ready to receive any suggestions which might be in fused into it by a skilful hand. He saAv in her, moreover, the wife of a man of large fortune, and high connections ; of moderate capacity, very much in love Avith her, and consequently easily led, provided she had a friend at her elbow able and willing to guide her ; and this post he destined for himself. \" She is an extraordinary creature,\" he soliloquized. \" Under my tuition, and sup ported by her husband's family and connec tions, she cannot fail to become a poAver of the first order in society. Between us we Avill resuscitate Holland House, and give laws to the world Ave live in. Lord A. shall see"], [213, "205 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. that I am fit for something better than a seat at the Ventilation Board.\" In idea he already saAv Lady Marston hold ing her court, composed of all the celebrities of the day \u2014 political, literary, and scientific ; himself the presiding genius, pronouncing, Avithout appeal, on the claims of all who should present themselves for admission. Woe to those Avhose sneers and rebuffs he had ex perienced on his first entrance on the scene, the recollection of which still rankled in his breast, and which it was the dearest Avish of his heart to be able to repay with interest ! To accomplish all this, of which Susan was the destined instrument, the first step must be to cultivate her good graces, and to effect a transfer of her affection from her husband to himself; a task in which he did not an ticipate much difficulty. That he had already made considerable progress he looked upon as certain. Like a prudent man, however, he determined to make assurance doubly sure, by obtaining a poAver over her Avhich she Avould not find it easy to shake off. From his own observation, as well as from Lady Dept ford's remarks, he felt convinced that there was"], [214, "206 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. a mystery connected Avith her early years, and of this mystery he was resolved to make him self master; but for his own use alone. His alliance with Lady Deptford he looked upon as a thing of the past, except in as far as it could assist his present plans. They were ingenious, no doubt, but they had more Aveak points in them than their author was aAvare of. Sir Hubert Avas not exactly the man he fancied him to be ; and nothing but his egregious vanity could have led him to misconstrue the interest which Lady Marston had appeared to take in his conversation, and the attentions Avith which she endeavoured to cover, or atone for, the ungracious manners of her nieces and their husbands. He entirely overlooked, also, the determined opposition Avith which his' projects, when developed, Avould be met by Lady Deptford and all connected with her."], [215, "207 CHAPTER IX. \"I think, Lady Marston,\" said Mr Penrhys, on the following morning, as they were pacing the conservatory together ; \"I think I kneAV your father. Was he not in one of the govern ment offices ? I forget Avhich.\" Susan coloured, for he had broached a sub ject most embarrassing to her, but she did not hesitate in her reply. \" Yes, he was, but which I do not really know. Almost since I can remember he had retired on a pension, on account of ill-health.\" \" So I understood, poor man. To one so afflicted the death of your mother must have been a great loss. But he married again, I believe. Is his widoAv still living?\" This questioning was anything but pleasing"], [216, "208 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. to Lady Marston. It was generally understood by all her new connections that there were cir cumstances of a painful nature connected with the last years of her father's life ; and, as a matter of course, the subject was never alluded to by them. But such delicacy was foreign to Penrhys' nature, especially Avhen he had an object in view. He thought he had hit upon the key of the mystery, and determined to folloAv up his inquiries, regardless of the an noyance he was causing, and which was suffi ciently apparent to one so quick-sighted as himself. If anything, it Avas an additional inducement, but he had to deal with one not easily intimidated, or forced into doing any thing against her will. His first attack had taken her by surprise, but she now thought it time to put a stop to a conversation, which might lead her farther than she Avished to go. She replied shortly, \" My father's widoAv is still alive, but as the subject is a disagreeable one to me, we will, if you please, change it.\" Mr Penrhys Avas profuse in his expressions of regret at having been so unfortunate as to hit upon so distressing a topic of conversation. \" My only object,\" he said, \" Avas to ascer-"], [217, "209 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. tain if you were the daughter of my old friend.\" \" What was your friend's name, his Chris tian name, I mean ?\" This was a poser ; at a venture he said, \" John.\" \"That was not my father's name, so he could not have been the Mr Ashford you kneAV. \" Mr Penrhys bit his lips, for he felt himself baffled, vrhile his curiosity was increased. \" I regret it,\" he said ; \" for the interest I felt in him AArould have been his child's by right. But I trust you will alloAv me the hon our of your friendship, though I have no here ditary claim to it.\" Before she could reply, Lord Deptford came into the conservatory. \" Aunt Susan,\" he cried, \" the horses will be round in a minute, and you have not your habit on. Mr Penrhys, you must excuse me for carrying her off from you, but I am the representative of marital authority. Hubert says you are to make haste, or you will keep everybody Avaiting.\" Then giving her his arm, he continued, as soon as he thought himself VOL. II. 14"], [218, "210 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. out of ear-shot, \" Aunt Susan, mind what you are about Avith that man. I daresay I am prejudiced against him in many respects, but it is not prejudice that makes me say he is a dangerous man. Never give him your confi dence, or you will live to repent it. What induced Hubert to ask him here, I cannot divine.\" Susan had no intention of taking Mr Pen rhys into her confidence ; but her pride took the alarm at this sort of lecture from one whom, though older than herself, she chose to con sider as little more than a boy. She replied rather more gravely than usual, \" Thanks for your caution, for I am sure it is Avell meant, but as regards my intercourse Avith my guests, I think I am quite able to take care of myself, and if ever I do require advice, I have my husband to apply to.\" \" You are angry with me, Aunt Susan, or at least, annoyed at wdiat you think an imperti nent interference. But do me the justice to believe that it Avas dictated by my sincere affection for yourself and Hubert. I again repeat, that man is dangerous, and a mischief maker.\""], [219, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 211 \" My dear Deptford, no need to assure me of your affection for us,\" said his aunt. \" No one can be more thoroughly convinced of it than I am. I Avas not angry, but I own a little annoyed at the tone you adopted, so let us pass a mutual amnesty, if we have either of us said anything to hurt the other. As for Mr Penrhys, I have no particular liking for him, though I do not share your opinions regarding him. At all events he can do me no mischief, and I tell you honestly, that it is the marked antipathy of yourself and your sisters that, in a manner, compels me to be more attentive to him than I otherwise should be. You have even contrived to set everybody else against him. I really felt pained when Lord Winder- mere desired him so haughtily to refrain, for the future, from calling his wife by her Chris tian name. He ought to have recollected that Mr Penrhys had known her from a child, and if he thought such familiarity out of place now, he might have said so in private, and not be fore all of us.\" \" Well pleaded, Aunt Susan. But was it not good? I hardly thought Windermere had it in him. But confess that no one but"], [220, "212 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. a loAv-born cur would have exposed himself to such a rebuff. As long as Cecilia was Miss Wilmington, if my mother chose to allow it \u2014 though in my private opinion she ought never to have done so \u2014 there was nothing to be said ; but he might have had the sense to knoAV that it was an impertinence to the Countess of Windermere. He will be calling you 'Susan' next, and then he will have Hubert doAvn upon him.\" Susan raised her hand as if to box his ears, but he caught hold of it and kissed it, and she vanished up-stairs to don her riding-gear. Lady Marston told her husband all that had passed, and his advice to her was to go on as usual, and make no difference in her be haviour to Mr Penrhys. \" We cannot,\" he said, \" be expected to enter into the feuds of our guests, wdiich to tell you the truth, I think they had much better have suspended as long as they are in this house. At the same time, I do not think our friend Penrhys improves upon acquaint ance. There is no doubt that his intimacy with my sister has been the cause of much heart-burning in her family, and his attempt"], [221, "213 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. to pump you about your father Avas indelicate, to say the least of it. We will be civil to him in the superlative degree during the short time he has still to remain, but I do not think we shall either of us regret him so much, as to wish him to repeat his visit here. In London you will receive him, as you have hitherto done, on the footing of a common ac quaintance.\" In this opinion Lady Marston cordially agreed. She had become much attached to Lord Deptford and his sisters, and it was particularly disagreeable to her to be ap parently siding with one Avhom, right or Avrong, they considered as their enemy. Unfortunately for her, from various circum stances, a sort of intimacy Avas gradually in fused into her intercourse with Mr Penrhys. The marked avoidance of the others appeared to increase during the remainder of that gentleman's stay at ThornAvood. Notwith standing the remonstrances of Sir Hubert and herself, they all but cut him, and this naturally threAv him more and more into Susan's society. The gentlemen were either shooting or hunting all day, and Penrhys Avas not a sportsman."], [222, "214 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. The ladies, Avhen not riding or driving, had their own separate occupations. With Lady Deptford, it is true, he still maintained his position, but she was hardly ever visible before luncheon, and it was only in the evening that she Avas able to lay violent hands on him, and secure him for long whispering conversations on the sofa, while the rest were dancing, or playing some round game. Thus, for some hours every day, he and Susan became con stant companions. He Avas really a man of natural taste, and she found his suggestions for her garden, and the ornamental buildings of her poultry yard, or dairy, of great use. He also gave her hints for sketching \u2014 an occu pation only lately entered on \u2014 wdiich proved that he was thoroughly acquainted with that branch of art. Once or twice he undertook to correct her rather rude attempts, and pointed out her faults with a bluntness, which showed that he had formed a right estimate of her character. \" Do you think,\" she once said, \" I shall ever be able to draw tolerably ? \" \" Tolerably, yes. Enough to amuse your self, and to produce souvenirs of any place"], [223, "215 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. that may chance to interest you ; but I do not think you Avill ever draw like an artist. Music is your vocation. In that you are really great, and that I hope you will never neglect, for with your voice and taste it would be inexcusable. But of that I should say there is no fear, for you seem to prefer it to all your other occupations.\" \" Ah, that is natural enough, for Hubert is very fond of music, and sings well himself, while he does not care for painting or drawing.\" \" So I should suppose. He seems to prefer field-sports to everything else.\" \" Oh, no. Not in England at least. He is very fond of hunting, I believe, but I have heard him say that he finds the shooting here very tame and insipid, after what he had at the Cape. In fact, he goes out now rather for the purpose of doing the honours to his guests, than for any pleasure he finds in it himself.\" \" Likely enough,\" replied Penrhys. \" Phea sants and hares must be but poor substitutes for elephants and giraffes. However, he does not look as if he much regretted the change. It must be a real gratification to his friends to"], [224, "216 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. see Iioav kindly he takes to domestic life after all the adventures of his early days.\" \" Yes, poor fellow, he had a hard time of it for the first year or two of his exile.\" \" I was not thinking so much of that,\" said Penrhys, \" as of his previous career. His youth, I have heard, was rather a wild one ; orageuse, as our neighbours wrould say.\" Susan felt instinctively that she Avas tread ing upon dangerous ground, and that her wisest course Avould be to let the conversation drop. She hesitated for a moment between the dictates of curiosity and discretion ; naturally, curiosity prevailed. \" You allude, I suppose,\" she said, \" to his engagement to Miss Wood, and the heartless manner in which she treated him.\" \" Partly to that. But it is hardly just to use the word ' heartless.' When she heard of his flirtation and the report of his engagement Avith that girl in Canada, her conduct was, to a certain extent, excusable, though she might have guessed that he was only amusing him self after the fashion of young gentlemen in country-quarters. They laugh and they ride aAvay, and so it turned out in this instance.\""], [225, "217 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" What girl in Canada ? \" Lady Marston asked, as soon as she could recover herself ; for her companion's last speech had affected her most painfully ; \" I never heard of her.\" \" Good Heavens, what have I been doing !\" exclaimed Penrhys. \" I concluded, as a matter of course, that you kneAV all about that unfor tunate business ; though, after all, there may have been nothing in it. I did not myself know Sir Hubert at that time. All I heard of him was gossip picked up at second-hand, and is probably not true, or at least grossly exag gerated. And if true, Avhat does it amount to ? That Sir Hubert is a great admirer of beauty, that he was a little wild in his bachelor days, that he has now steadied down into a respectable married man, and,\" \u2014 added Mr Penrhys, with a gallant boAV, \u2014 \" by his choice of a Avife has deprived himself of all excuse for taking note of the beauty of others.\" But the compliment passed unheeded, if indeed it was heard by her to Avhom it was addressed. So far Penrhys' experiment had succeeded, for an experiment it was. Day bjr day the pleasure he took in Susan's society had gone on increasing, till at length, notwith-"], [226, "218 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. standing his boasted self-control, it became a passion as nearly resembling love, as a man so utterly and hopelessly selfish was capable of feeling. When first conscious of his Aveak ness, he had felt furious Avith himself for the infatuation into which he had been betrayed, and no particular good-will to her Avho had been the cause of it. At all events, if he ever had entertained any scruples on her account, they were dismissed at once and for ever, and he sat down resolutely to play out the game, and win it if he could. Not that he entertained any doubts of ultimate success. He Avas greatly relieved to find that, though he had been tampering with his peace of mind, his poAvers of mental vision were as clear as ever, that he Avas as well able to calculate the chances for and against him, as if he were merely a looker-on. On the one hand, he felt certain that every day he Avas making some progress in Susan's regard ; but on the other, he was compelled to acknowledge that her husband still reigned over her heart Avith un divided SAvay. He had been greatly irritated by the commiserating tone in which she had just spoken of Marston's early disappointment,"], [227, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 219 and he had iioav given her a taste of what might be in store for herself. Could he but once persuade her of Hubert's unworthiness, the game, he felt sure, Avould be in his oavii hands. It might be a work of time, but for that he was prepared ; he Avas never in a hur ry. It might, and probably Avould, cost Susan her all of happiness ; but he could not be ex pected to boggle at that, if it Avere necessary to secure his own. They Avalked on in silence ; Penrhys wait ing for some Avord from his companion, which might throw further light upon the nature of the feelings which his disclosure had excited ; she, Avretched from a consciousness that her faith in her husband had been rudely shaken, and still more perhaps from a sense of her OAvn indiscretion, in having alloAved a comparative stranger \u2014 a man, too, against whom she had been cautioned \u2014 to discuss such a topic with her. Lord Deptford's Avarning Avords and her own confident assertion, that Mr Penrhys could never work her mischief, recurred painfully to her memory. But then she fortunately recalled the conversation that had taken place betAveen them on the subject of her father, and a sort"], [228, "220 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. of reaction took place. She felt as if guilty of treachery to her husband, in attaching any im portance to accusations against him coming from such a source, and which, had she done her duty, she Avould have silenced at once. These thoughts flashed across her mind Avith the rapidity of lightning, and for the feAv se conds she was immersed in them, she com pletely forgot she Avas not alone. Suddenly turning her head, she noticed her companion watching her countenance Avith an expression of malicious curiosity, exceedingly displeasing to her. It had the effect of recalling her to herself, and did more to restore her composure than any other course he could have adopted. She decided at once in her OAvn mind that all he had asserted Avas pure fiction, invented for the purpose of testing her feelings. \" What a singular pleasure,\" she said, \" peo ple seem to take in bearing false Avitness against their neighbour ! Those, from whom you heard this tale, must have knoAvn but little of Hubert to have made him the hero of it. And iioav let us return to the house ; luncheon must be ready.\" Adding, with a smile, which cost her a desperate effort, and greatly puzzled"], [229, "221 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Mr Penrhys, \" Hoav poor Hubert's ears must be tingling ! \" Mr Penrhys Avas not altogether satisfied with the result of his attempt. That Susan had been greatly startled at first by his revela tions there could be no doubt, but it was equally certain that, apparently at least, she had regained her composure before they parted. Still, with his fancied infallible knoAvledge of human nature, he settled in his own mind that Susan's tranquillity was, to a great extent, as sumed. The sting might have been extracted, but he felt assured that some portion of the venom remained festering in the wound. \" The first step to obtain her confidence is made,\" he said to himself. \" She may put as bold a face upon it as she likes, but there was no mistaking the fluctuations of that speaking countenance. A child might have read it. She is jealous ; and Avhen once her trust in her husband's principles is destroyed \u2014 and she has already learnt to doubt \u2014 to Avhom but to me can she turn for advice, and perchance for consolation ! \" He would not have spoken so confidently, could he have read her thoughts. He had"], [230, "222 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. endeavoured to poison her happiness, and, though he had partially succeeded, the blow recoiled upon himself. Convinced of his du- plicity, Susan did her best to dismiss from her mind all recollection of the tale he had told her, but there Avere times when, to her great dis- composure, it would force its way in, and obtain a sort of half-belief. Not for long, cer- tainly, and these moments of trial and tempt- ation Avere invariably succeeded by a feeling of remorse and shame for her own weakness, and of aversion and distrust for the author of it, as great as that which was professed by the Wil- mingtons. She did not attempt to fathom the motives of his conduct, but she felt de- graded by his having dared to make her the confidant of his malicious gossip aBout her husband. Had he been less successful in tampering with her loyalty, in all probability she would have been less affected by the at tempt ; as it was, her indignation knew no bounds, although she had sufficient self-com- mand to keep it to herself. She still treated him Avith all becoming civility, but she sedu lously avoided every occasion of finding herself alone Avith him. He could not but notice this"], [231, "223 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. change in her demeanour, and was naturally piqued at it, though he hardly knew to what cause to attribute it ; whether to her oavii will, the injunctions of her husband, or the repre sentations of Lord Deptford and his sisters. Another might have felt discouraged by such persistent avoidance. Not so Mr Penrhys ! To one so confident in his oavii resources, diffi culties to be overcome only acted as an addi tional incentive, and confirmed him in his determination to reduce that proud and rebellious spirit to subjection. It was a com pliment he owed to himself. \u2014 The day of his departure arrived. He thanked Lady Marston and her husband Avarmly for the agreeable time he had passed at the Priory, and ex pressed a hope that it would not be long before they all met again. If this was intended as a hint for another invitation to Thornwood, it failed in its effect. Marston had had enough of him, and Susan was delighted to get rid of him. They both wished him good-bye Avith extreme cordiality, but made no further sign. Even Lady Deptford seemed relieved, as the carriage which conveyed him to the station rolled away from the door. His frequent"], [232, "224 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. conferences with her sister-in-law had ended by exciting her suspicions, notAvithstanding his assurances that his only object was to for- Avard her views. As for the rest of the party, they made no secret of their satisfaction. Every one seemed to breathe more freely, and Lord Deptford declared his intention of mak ing Mr Penrhys' effigy take the place of that of Mr Guido FaAvkes, on the approaching Fifth of November. Though the author of her disquiet had de parted, Susan did not regain her peace of mind. On the contrary, now that he was no longer present, she brooded over his revelations till she was almost convinced of their truth, and found herself more than once regretting that she had not obtained from him more explicit information. That her husband had ever been engaged to any one but Caroline Wood she did not believe, but she could not divest her self of the idea that he had amused his leisure hours in Canada, and probably elseAvhere, with flirtations more or less innocent. This thought gave her inexpressible pain, for, if Avhat she feared was true, he stood convicted of an in constant and fickle disposition. The knoAv-"], [233, "225 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. ledge that his heart had once been completely in possession of another Avas hard to bear, but that at least Avas no secret. It had been frankly acknoAvledged, and she felt convinced that every trace of affection for his faithless bride was completely obliterated. But, with the ingenuity of a self-tormentor, she contrived to turn this conviction into a weapon against herself. True, she had no rival now, but hoAv long would it last ! If he could so easily for get the love of his youth, what security was there that she might not in turn be forgotten also ! Had the case been hers, pride and contempt for the offender might have enabled her to bear the blow, but she could never have loved a second time. Once, when alone Avith Hubert, she con trived to turn the conversation upon Canada and its inhabitants, male and female, but after answering her first two or three questions, Marston told her that, Avith the exception of the few weeks he had passed amongst the Indians, his residence there had been con nected Avith too many painful incidents to make it an agreeable topic. \"Question me about the Cape,\" he said, VOL. II. 15"], [234, "226 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" as much as you please, but do not force me to recall my Canadian recollections. They are anything but pleasant.\" He referred to the breaking off of his engagement with Caroline Wood, and his brother's marriage, which occurred whilst he was there. She put a very different interpret ation upon his Avords. Susan Avas no adept at concealing her feel ings, and her husband was not long in making the discovery, that her manner towards him was gradually undergoing a change, for Avhich he was quite at a loss to account. At one time she Avas peevish and capricious, rejecting his advances almost Avith rudeness, at another, yielding to the anxious tenderness Avith which he endeavoured to soothe her, she wrould burst into tears and entreat him to forgive her petu lance and ill-humour. At length, this state of uncertainty became more than she could bear. She Avrote to Mrs Digby, who Avas again set tled with her husband at Kensington, telling; her what she had heard, and, Avith a feeble protest that she herself did not believe a Avoid of it, entreated her to find out from Mr Digby if there was any foundation for the tale."], [235, "227 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Lucy did not keep her long waiting for a re ply. She told her that John had asserted in the most solemn \"manner that there was not a shadow of truth in the story she had heard, though \"it was just possible that old Mr W. might have alleged something of the sort to cover his daughter's breach of faith. M. had never for a moment wavered in his devotion to C.W. till she threw him over. John had seen M. on his return to England, and never in his life Avitnessed such utter prostration of spirit. M., John says, is the most single-hearted as he is the most single-minded of men, and if his wife does not appreciate him as such, she do.es not deserve him. Her cousin's words conveyed conviction Avith them. \" Ah, yes,\" she exclaimed, in an agony of remorse, \" I do not deserve him. How could I ever have mistrusted that noble heart ! how can I atone for my childish folly ! But never again Avill I admit a doubt of his truth or constancy.\" Unfortunately, Sir Hubert came to look for his Avife in her own room Avhile she was absent, and seeing Mrs Digby's letter on the writing table, took it up and, to while away the time,"], [236, "228 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. began to read it. At that time they had the habit of reading each other's letters \u2014 a habit, I believe, much more common in the early days of married life than it is at a later period. Notwithstanding Lucy's diplomatic use of ini tials, the subject of her letter was transparent enough, and filled Marston with surprise and anger. He had not finished it when Lady Marston entered the room. \" Pray, Susan,\" he said, severely, \" may I ask what is the meaning of this letter of Mrs Digby's, and what has called it forth ? \" Susan was not much given to fainting, but it Avas as much as she coidd do to refrain from it, Avhen she saw the accusing letter in her husband's hands. \" Oh, Hubert ! \" she exclaimed, Avithout thinking, \" that letter is for me, for me alone.\" \" So I conclude ; but have the goodness to answer my question. What called it forth?\" For a moment she hesitated, and then she told him all she had heard \u2014 her suspicions, her anguish of mind ; Iioav, not being able to bear the uncertainty any longer, she had im plored her cousin to find out the truth, and"], [237, "229 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Iioav, on the receipt of her letter, every doubt had vanished. \" Mrs Digby has told you no more than the truth,\" he said, when she had finished, \"but why did not you apply to me instead of to her ? Did you ever knoAv of my telling you an untruth ? \" \" Oh, never, never ! Forgive me \u2014 I Avas Avicked, I was mad! But, indeed, I meant to ask you, when you told me never to mention Canada again.\" \" I remember. And noAv it only remains for me to ask the name of your informant.\" This Avas a question for Avhich she was not prepared. Visions of a quarrel \u2014 of a duel, perhaps \u2014 -flitted across her mind. \" Do not ask me, Hubert,\" she said, \" I cannot, as a point of honour, tell you his name.\" \" If you put it on such grounds as that, I have done ; though I confess I think such delicacy toAvards the calumniator of your hus band, and the enemy of your own happiness, misplaced. Keep your secret if you please \u2014 though it is not a very difficult one to guess \u2014"], [238, "230 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. but remember that, whatever diminution of confidence may arise between us in conse quence, I am not to blame. And on one point you may set your mind at ease ; I shall never again take the liberty of reading any letter addressed to you.\" . Saying Avhich, he left the room. Susan remained like one annihilated. Never before had she seen her husband manifest such displeasure, never before had he quitted her so abruptly, Avithout a word of affection, and never perhaps had she felt such a yearning for his love. She did not accuse him of unkind ness, for in a natural spirit of humility she ackuoAvledged to herself that she deserved it all, and more. Hoav could she regain his confidence ? She had already confessed her fault and entreated his forgiveness, and ap parently in vain. One Avay there Avas perhaps of making her peace with him \u2014 by denounc ing the author of the slanderous tale ; but much as she now disliked and despised Mr Penrhys, to this seeming act of treachery she could not bring herself. Besides, what would her husband think of such a concession, when she had already told him that it was a feeling"], [239, "231 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. of honour which prevented her compliance. Judging him by herself, an avowal so tardily and reluctantly made could only inspire him Avith contempt. She did her best, poor girl, to conciliate him \\\\rhen next they met. All their guests had noAv left them, with the exception of Lord Deptford, and a fresh batch was expected in a day or tAvo. Her looks, so different from her usual cheerful manner, shoAved plainly enough how much she suffered, and her eyes looked suspiciously red. Still, in the presence of her nepheAv, she bore up bravely, and, for a time, succeeded in hoodwinking that rather super ficial observer. Marston did not think it necessary to take the same trouble. His manner, though studiously civil to her, was coldness itself. All her little efforts to attract his attention, and extort from him something more than the most common-place answers, were utterly fruitless, and Lord Deptford at last became aware that there Avas something Avrong. \" What is it, Aunt Susan ?\" he asked, when he found himself alone Avith her. \"What do you mean?\" she said, hardly"], [240, "232 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. able to repress her tears at the thought that another had noticed her husband's indiffer- ence. \"I mean,\" was the reply, \"that there is some misunderstanding between you and Hu bert. What is it? You know it is not curiosity that makes me ask.\" \" Oh, no ; I know it is not, but I cannot tell you. I am so unhappy, and it is all my own fault.\" \" Tell him so, and my word for it, it will all come right.\" She followed his advice : and when next alone with Marston told him hoAv unhappy she was, and Iioav sincere was her repentance for having offended him. But Marston Avas not so easily appeased. He had been deeply Avounded by the unjust suspicions she had harboured against him ; wounded in the most sensitive point, by seeing his integrity, his honour, called in question by his wife, by the being he loved best upon earth. He Avas wounded too deeply to be just. Had he then taken her to his bosom, and kissed the tears from her eyes, in all pro bability he would have established his claims"], [241, "233 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. to her gratitude and confidence so firmly, that nothing could ever have shaken them again. Her enthusiastically generous nature would have appreciated the magnanimity of such conduct. Unfortunately, he took another course. Perhaps he called to mind Mrs Tin dal's remarks on Susan's jealous tendencies, of which he had seen some slight symptoms on occasion of the pic-nic, and thought it a good opportunity for giving her a lesson, which should prevent the recurrence of any misun derstanding of a similar nature. At all events, instead of responding to the cry of her repent ance, he merely said, \" Do you think then that I too can feel otherwise than unhappy, when I find that you have alloAved a third person, a scoundrel whose name you refuse to mention, to place himself betAveen you and me?\" \" Never, never, Hubert. Do not put it in that way. There is no one betAveen us. I did not encourage his confidences. They were thrust upon me.\" \" No one Avould dare to thrust such confi dences on a AA'ife, unless he felt pretty sure that they would be well received.\" Had he loved her less, had he taken her"], [242, "234 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. imprudence less to heart, he would never have uttered such cruel words, repented almost before they had escaped his lips ; but even if he had wished to recall them, it was noAv too late. Susan started back as if she had been stung, while her pale cheeks flushed Avith an ger at the unmerited reproach. \" I am ansAvered,\" she said. \" I came to you, hoping that the acknoAvledgment of my fault \u2014 my crime, if you will \u2014 and my sincere repentance would have obtained my pardon, and I find only a judge.\" And with these Avords she left the room. Marston made a step to the door to detain her, but she Avas already gone ; and when he opened it, he just caught a glimpse of her as she vanished into her own room. He had half a mind to folloAv her, for he felt that he had gone too far, and that her reproof was not un deserved. But then he reflected that, if he made the advances now, it would be a virtual defeat, an acknoAvledgment that, if she had been to blame in the first instance, he had ended by putting himself in the wrong ; and then, in all probability, the whole battle would"], [243, "235 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. have to be fought over again, and the same scenes perpetually recurring. \"No misery,\" he argued, \"like a jealous wife ! For her own happiness, as for mine, she must be cured of it before it becomes a chronic disease. I Avill leave her to meditate on what has passed, and when she sees how miserable she has made us both by her unfounded suspicions, her good sense and lov ing heart will teach her to repress them in future. I wish I had not made that unlucky speech, for I believe fully in her repentance. No wonder she was angry, poor darling, and when the fit is passed, I will prove to her by my affection that she is dearer to me than ever. It is the only fault she has.\" Good resolves ! but he would have done far better to have folloAved her to her own room, and come to a frank explanation wdth her then and there. The fit, as he was pleased to call it, did not pass. Susan felt that she had done all she was called upon, all that it was in her poAver, to do, to clear up the misunder standing between them. She now hardened her heart, and determined to make no further"], [244, "236 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. attempts at conciliation. Had he loved her truly, loved her as she once fancied he did, nothing more beyond Avhat she had already done would have been needed. When they met at dinner, Marston accosted her in his usual manner, as if nothing extra ordinary had happened. He meant it as kindness ; he felt that she must be discom posed by what had passed, and he wished to set her at her ease. Susan did not interpret his proceedings in this way. She understood it to signify that her anger and vexation were matters of perfect indifference to him. Such heartless conduct, as it seemed to her, only aroused her indignation, and she determined to let him feel it. She treated him almost as a stranger, ansAvering his observations, when compelled to do so, Avith the most frigid politeness, never addressing him except by his title, and directing her conversation almost exclusively to Lord Deptford and Dr Snod grass, who, with his nephew, chanced to dine with them that day. The lady of the house naturally commanded the attention of her guests, and Marston found himself almost sent to Coventry. He was greatly mortified by"], [245, "237 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. this conduct on the part of his wife ; but though he let fall some expressions of annoy ance \u2014 intelligible to Susan, if to no one else \u2014 she allowed them to pass unnoticed. Ap parently, she Avas in the highest spirits, Avhich seemed to increase every moment ; her tears she kept for the solitude of her OAvn room."], [246, "238 CHAPTER X. \" My dear Deptford,\" said Lady Marston, one morning, \" do you never mean to ride with me again ? What with your hunting and shooting you have quite forgotten your gallantry. Do give me a good gallop to-day. I am dying for one, and to-night Ave shall have the house full of people, of whom I do not know half, but to Avhoni I must devote my self for the next fortnight. It is my last day of independence. Let us order the horses directly after breakfast.\" \" With pleasure. Why did you not men tion it before ? You know I am always at your orders. Won't you join us, Hubert ? \" Marston looked Avistfully at his wife, so wistfully, that, had she seen him, she must"], [247, "239 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. perforce have relented ; but Avhile her nephew was speaking, she turned her head away. Her husband replied with something like a sigh, \"No, not to-day. I must\" meet John Smith by appointment. Mrs Smith wants some ad dition to their house, and I have promised to see about it. She is so good a woman, as daughter and wife, that she deserves encourage ment. I Avould not disappoint her for the Avorld.\" \" Kind fathers and husbands make good daughters and wives,\" said Lady Marston. Sir Hubert bit his lips. He had not in tended any allusion to his own situation, and it pained him to find Susan so ready to pick up the gauntlet, undeterred by the presence of a third person. Deptford, avIio perhaps felt even more embarrassed than his uncle, hastened to change the conversation ; but as soon as he and Susan Avere alone, riding side by side after their first canter, he said to her, \" My dear Aunt Susan, this will never do. I do not seek to penetrate the mystery, but it is evident there is something Avrong between you and Hubert, and you are both of you frittering away your happiness. Do let me"], [248, "240 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. entreat of you to come to an understanding with him at once. I said this once before; do not be angry at my repeating this advice, for believe me it is good.\" \" I followed your advice, but it has not pro fited me much. I humbled myself before him, as I never thought to have humbled myself before any created being, and I was met Avith taunts and coldness. I am not angry Avith you, certainly, but pray let it be understood that the subject is never to be mentioned be tAA'een us again. As for our happiness, my happiness at least, the less said of it the better. Just now it lies in the prospect of another gallop, so let me make the most of it.\" \" Shall I speak to Hubert ? Perhaps he Avould listen to me.\" \" Listen to you, when he repulses me ! No, thank you. Forgive me, Deptford, if I seem to speak harshly,\" she added, after a momentary pause, and holding out her hand to him. \" I hardly knoAv Avhat I say at times, and I can not afford to lose a friend, and such a friend as you. But I cannot submit to any interference betAveen my husband and myself. If my only chance of retaining the little affection he"], [249, "241 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. may still feel for me lies in the intercession of another person, I had rather lose it at once.\" Again Thornwood was filled with company ; and Lady Marston exerted herself to the ut most to make her house agreeable to her guests. And with perfect success. To see her, no one could have supposed that she had a care or a sorrow. True, her laugh had lost its joy ous tone, her appetite was capricious, the flush on her cheeks was rather the hectic of feverish excitement than the hue of health, but no one was more energetic in promoting every plan that promised amusement. Her nature seemed to have undergone a complete change. She rode, she drove, she danced, she sang, she took lessons in billiards, but Avithout ever putting herself too prominently forward, or attempting to secure more than her fair share of attention. In her intercourse Avith Sir Hubert there Avas nothing with which any one, but himself, could have found fault. She kept the most careful guard over her language, and repressed every inclination to utter a retort or sarcasm, hoAvever great the temptation. Nay more, Avhenever she had occasion to speak of her husband, it Avas always in terms of respect VOL. II. 16"], [250, "242 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. and esteem. Certainly not feigned; for though she thought him unjust and harsh to her, capricious and inconstant in his attach ments, he Avas still the object of her unabated love. Sir Hubert seemed scrupulously to follow her example, although at times driven almost to frenzy by her self-possession. He still in dulged in the hope that all Avould come right at last ; and determined to let things take their course. He hunted and shot Avith his male friends, sang and danced with the ladies, and paid one or tAvo of them more attention than his Avife by any means approved of. There was, in particular, our old acquaintance Miss Trevor, Avho did her best to inveigle him into a flirtation, coram populo, and with no Avorse intention than that of keeping her hand in ; but to Susan it appeared a most auda cious invasion of her conjugal rights \u2014 rights Avhich, though in abeyance, she was not in clined to cede to any human being. Marston was too unhappy not to catch at any passing distraction. He cared no more for Miss Tre vor's blandishments than he Avould have done for those of Mrs Halkett, the housekeeper;"], [251, "243 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. but they rather amused him, and it se laissait faire, to Susan's great annoyance, who saw in this conduct fresh proofs of his fickleness. But neither by word nor gesture did she ever express her displeasure to either of the cul- prits. If anything, she Avas rather more gra- cious to Miss Trevor than to any one else. The result of this was that everybody voted them a charming couple, Avell up in their duties as host and hostess. \" What Penrhys could have meant by call ing this a dull house, I cannot divine,\" said Sir William Templeton, as he Avas lounging up and down the terrace in front of the house aa rith his Avife and the Trevors. \" I never Avas more agreeably surprised in my life. He talked of a prolonged honeymoon, and billing and cooing from morning to night. Now, it seems to me that, if the Marstons had been married ten years, they could not be a more matter-of-fact and undemonstrative couple, before company at all events.\" \" Whatever Mr Penrhys says, I make a point of disbelieving,\" observed Lady Tem pleton. \"I have a perfect horror of that man.\""], [252, "244 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Which does not prevent you from being very civil to him when you meet,\" replied her husband. \" What can I do ? One meets him every where, and he is not a man I should like to make an enemy of.\" \" And, after all,\" chimed in Mrs Trevor, \" he must know more about the Marstons than Ave do. He is Lady Deptford's bosom friend.\" \" Things may have been as he said when he Avas here a month ago, and changed since,\" said Miss Trevor. \" I suspect the truth is, that Lady Marston, who is nobody, married for rank and position, and that Sir Hubert is beginning to open his eyes to the fact.\" \" For shame, Julia,\" said her aunt, Lady Templeton. \"I do not believe a word of it. I never saAv any one whose countenance more strongly repels all idea of deceit and under hand dealing than Lady Marston's. If I have any skill in physiognomy, I should say that her fault lies in the opposite direction.\" \" Yes ; I suspect that, notwithstanding the cool indifference with which she treats"], [253, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 245 her husband, her Ladyship has a temper of her own,\" replied Miss Julia, \" Pray, Julia,\" asked Sir William, \" do you pick up materials for all these comments on Lady Marston in those mysterious confabula tions with Sir Hubert ? I can tell you, if I Avere in her place, I should not tolerate them as good-humouredly as she does. If you must flirt, why do you not set your cap at Deptford ? \" \" Because I prefer the uncle. He had much better have married me, as I intended he should when we were here last year. I should have suited him much better than Lady Marston.\" \"Nonsense, Julia,\" said her mother. \"Your uncle is quite right. I do not at all approve of all these useless demonstrations to a married man. \" My dear mamma, you knoAv that in Lon don I am the most submissive of daughters ; bestoAving my smiles upon no one but nobles of high degree, or heirs-apparent at the least ; but in the country do let me enjoy my innocent pleasures in my own Avay.\""], [254, "246 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Innocent pleasures ! \" exclaimed Sir Wil liam. \" Really, young ladies of the present day seem to have singular notions of inno cence. Making love to another woman's hus band!\" \" Julia is ambitious,\" said her aunt. \" She Avishes to furnish conversation for all London. But I must say that I think Sir Hubert would do better not to encourage her in her folly.\" \" Oh, Julia has her fair share of good looks, and Marston was always a great admirer of beauty ; Avitness Caroline Wood in former days, and his wife now, who, to my mind, is beauty personified.\" \" Well done, uncle ! \" said Miss Trevor, whose constitutional good-humour or indiffer ence had never given way beneath the attacks of which she had been the object. \" What Avill you say next ? I declare, aunt, in your place, I should be jealous.\" \" William did not marry me for my beauty, you silly child,\" replied Lady Templeton. \" But suppose we go in now, for I think we have discussed the Marstons long enough ; too much, indeed, considering we are living beneath their roof.\""], [255, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 247 Too much certainly for the comfort of one of them at least. Susan's sitting-room was immediately over the terrace on which this conversation had taken place, and the, windows being open \u2014 for the weather Avas unusually mild for the time of year\u2014 she had scarcely lost a Avoid. All she had heard went straight to her heart, and seemed to justify her worst suspicions. Already, notwithstanding all her endeavours, the coldness that existed between her and her husband was apparent to strangers, who saw too clearly that the love of the bridegroom had been replaced by the neglect of the careless and indifferent husband. She forgot that Sir William's words Avere equally applicable to herself. Then, again, Sir Hubert's devotion to beauty appeared to be well known, and to be held as a sufficient excuse for all delinquencies. As regarded Miss Trevor, she felt nothing but contempt. If he was to be seduced from his allegiance, it mattered but little to her by whom. But if he had indeed violated the sanctity of the marriage tie so far as to make Julia the confidant of his grievances, if indeed he had ventured to insinuate that she had married him only from ambition, it"], [256, "248 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. was time for her' to tear from her heart all affection for one so false and disloyal. She could not, she would not believe it without positive proof, but still the thought that it Avas just possible rankled in her mind. In a few more days the party broke up, and Susan contrived to maintain her outAvard serenity to the last. Lord Deptford Avas the first to depart. He was going to Leicester shire, and contrived to take leave of his aunt when they Avere alone. \" I am sorry to lose you, Deptford,\" she said, \" for when you are gone I shall not have a friend near me.\" \" Do not say that, Aunt Susan. You have a far better friend in Hubert than I could ever be. You shake your head, but one day you will find it so. You do not do him justice if you think otherwise, for he loves you Avell, and I cannot tell you Iioav it grieves me to see this inexplicable cloud arisen between you.\" \" God bless you, dear Deptford. Do not waste your thoughts on me. I shall do Avell enough, I dare say.\" The Trevors Avere the last to take their de-"], [257, "249 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. parture, and it was with a sigh of relief that Susan Avatched them enter the carriage that Avas to take them awray. But even here another bitter drop fell into her chalice. Sir Hubert had handed them in, the door Avas closed, but it seemed as if the leave-taking Avould never come to an end ; Miss Julia had so many last words to say, and Avhile she was say ing them, as if to enforce attention, her hand kept hold of Marston's. At length they drove off, and Marston, with a smile on his counten ance, returned to the breakfast-room in time to hear Susan utter a fervent \u2014 \" Thank God, they are all gone,\" as she turned aAvay from the Avindow. Their intention had been, as soon as their guests left them, to go to the Windermeres for the Christmas holidays, and then return to Thornwood, but Sir Hubert appeared to have changed his plans. At the sight of his wife's pale and stern countenance, his OAvn smile vanished. \" I think Ave have both had enough of visit ors and visiting,\" he said. \" A thorough change will do us both good. What do you"], [258, "250 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. say to sending an excuse to the Windermeres, and running over to Paris for a couple of months ? \" A short time before, the thoughts of a visit to Paris Avould have filled her with Avild de light, but now she answered carelessly, \" As you please. To me it is a matter of indifference.\" Marston Avas naturally hurt by this reply. He had heard her more than once express a wish to go to Paris, if but for a feAV weeks, and iioav that he offered to take her at once, at the sacrifice of his hunting for the rest of the season, his proposal met with only cold acquiescence, if acquiescence it could be called. His colour rose, and he asked, rather angrily, how long this state of things Avas to go on. \" I asked you to go to Paris, thinking it Avould please you, and you hardly condescend to give me a civil answer.\" \" If you will tell me Avhat I ought to have said, Sir Hubert, I Avill say it, I ansAvered as I felt, for all places are alike to me now.\" \" Then, we will carry out our first plans, and go to the Windermeres.\" \" As you please.\""], [259, "251 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" By Heavens, Lady Marston, this is in tolerable. I tell you fairly, this contemptuous treatment is more than I can bear. If this is your idea of the duties of a Avife, you ought never to have married.\" \" Yes,\" said Susan, her eyes kindling. \" No doubt, Julia Trevor would have made you a more suitable wife, as I heard her say myself.\" \" Julia Trevor ! \" \"Yes, Julia Trevor. I overheard her say that you ought to have married her, as she would have suited you much better than myself. And what is more, I heard her reproved for her conduct Avith you ; nor did you escape for the encouragement you gave her.\" Marston Avas too chivalrous to defend him self at the expense of a woman, though he might have alleged, Avith perfect truth, that all the advances had come from her. Perhaps too, his conscience pricked him a little for the toleration he had extended to them. Be that as it might, he Avas exceedingly annoyed to hear that they had been made the subject of comment, and Avas anything but pleased to find that it had reached the ears of his Avife."], [260, "252 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. He felt placed on his defence, and in his embarrassment found nothing better to say, than \u2014 \" A listener, Lady Marston ! for certainly Avhatever you may have picked up Avas not intended for you.\" \" No, no listener ; or, at least, an involun tary one ; but I cannot shut my ears when people speak so loud that their words reach me. \" May I ask Avho these people were ? \" \" You have no right to ask, and I Avill not tell you.\" Sir Hubert could not repress a feeling of impatience. \" Be it so,\" he said. \" We will go to Paris ; unless you prefer remaining here alone. I shall send an excuse to Windermere. In your present frame of mind, I should be very sorry to expose us to the wondering eyes of my relations.\" He turned to leave the room, but his Avife, determined, if possible, to have the last word, \u2022exclaimed, \" Besides, Julia Trevor Avill not be there.\""], [261, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 253 This taunt irritated him beyond the poAvers of endurance. \" Miss Tre\\ror,\" he said, in a voice hoarse Avith passion, \" is no more to me than she is to you ; and I forbid you, Lady Marston, ever again to couple her name with mine.\" \" Very well,\" she replied ; \" I am your Avife, and Avill obey. It will not be more difficult for me to be silent noAv, than it was Avhile she Avas here.\" No hope of a reconciliation after this ; but they seemed tacitly agreed to avoid all sub jects of dissension. No more bitter Avoids passed between them ; and their intercourse Avas that of a AArell-bred and ill-matched couple, who, having discovered the mistake they had made in marrying, had the good sense to make the best of a bad job. They went to Paris, and Susan could not but feel interested in all she saw. Everything was so perfectly new to her, that her husband Avas sometimes betrayed into a smile by her naive expressions of astonishment. They had no intention of going into society, but they fell in with many of their London acquaintance, without the"], [262, "254 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. trouble of looking for them, bent, like them selves, upon taking the pleasures and amuse ments of Paris as easily as possible. To both of them, a tete-a-tete seemed the one thing to be avoided. Both of them sought, in a round of perpetual excitement, to obliterate all recol lection of the past, all thoughts of wdiat the future might have in reserve for them ; and every evening saw them engaged to a dinner party at one of the best restaurateurs, suc ceeded, generally, by a visit to one of the theatres. A more trifling, a more unprofit able existence it would be difficult to conceive ; and yet, by degrees, they both got accustomed to it, and fell into it as if it had been their natural state \u2014 living but for the enjoyment of the moment, and miserable Avhen left to the companionship of their own thoughts. For, paradoxical as it may appear, this long estrangement had in no degree abated the love they felt for each other. It had assumed in both the shape of a hopeless passion, and burnt, perhaps, all the more fiercely for being concealed. It required but the merest acci dent to call it forth. A fit of illness, a reverse of fortune, or any sudden calamity, Avoidd have"], [263, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 255 opened their hearts, and united them in a common and indissoluble alliance against the strokes of fate. Prosperity kept them apart, and widened the breach between them. There Avas a moment, however, when it seemed as if an event, which Avas the source of happiness to both, ought to have dispelled the baleful atmosphere by which they were surrounded. One morning, Susan came into their sitting-room with a letter in her hand, and radiant with pleasure. \" Oh, Hubert,\" she exclaimed, the first time she had so addressed him for many a long day, \" I have received a letter from Harry, telling me that Uncle James is dead, and has left him ninety thousand pounds. He was established as a merchant at Bombay. Harry met him quite by chance on the Neilgherry Hills. And Harry is going to be married to General Tempest's daughter, and hopes to be in England in a twelvemonth at latest. But here is his letter ; read it yourself.\" But if she had forgot, Sir Hubert remem bered his declaration never again to read a letter addressed to her. He put back the letter gently with one hand."], [264, "256 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" I am delighted at Harry's good-fortune; but read yourself what you think will interest me,\" he said. Susan was deeply wounded. \" It was foolish in me to offer you the let ter, for I have already told you all it contains, except that he desires to be most affection ately remembered to you.\" For an instant Marston Avas tempted for once to violate the rigid adherence to his word, on which he piqued himself; but, while he hesitated, she left the room, and it was too late. As some sort of atonement, wThen he went out he bought a magnificent bracelet, which he presented to her on his return ; but it was noAV her turn. She, too, had made a vow to accept no further presents from him. \" Thank you, Sir Hubert,\" she said, \" but I have more jeAvels and trinkets already than I know Avhat to do writh. I have no wish for more.\" \" But it is bought and paid for. Bought for you. I must insist upon your taking it. Is it a command ? \" she asked. Marston shut the case with more violence"], [265, "257 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. than he was in the habit of exhibiting. He muttered something, in which the word \" heart less \" was alone audible. Heartless ! when a wrord of affection wTould have brought her to his feet. One more attempt he made ; but this time in writing. A short time before their return to England, she found the folloAving letter lying on her dressing-table : \" I know that ladies are in the habit of making large additions to their toilette before leaving Paris. Oblige me by accepting the enclosed to assist you in making preparations for your London season. \u2014 H. M.\" The enclosed being ten billets de banque for one thousand francs each. But Avithin a quarter of an hour they were returned to the donor, with many thanks for his generosity, but with an intimation that Lady Marston had as much money as she required. VOL. II. 17"], [266, "258 CHAPTER XL If matters Avere thus unsatisfactory during their residence at Paris, they were no better on their return to England, Avhich took place a short time before Easter. Sir Hubert Avent straight to Thornwood, on business, either real or pretended, Avhich he affirmed Avould detain him some weeks. Lady Marston elected to remain in London, although she knew that it would be one perpetual struggle to conceal the real state of affairs from the Digbys and her other friends. She got off, however, better than she expected. John Digby had obtained from some source or another an inkling, that all was not quite right between the Marstons, and he cautioned his Avife against any questions or allusions, which might prove a source of"], [267, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 259 embarrassment to her cousin. Lucy, of course, was dying to know all how and about it, but was obliged to content herself with such in formation as Susan vouchsafed to afford her, which in fact was nil. Once, Mrs Digby attempted to lure Lady Marston into a more expansive frame of mind, by covert insinuations against the male sex generally, and husbands in particular. \" Men are so selfish, my dear. They have no scruple in leaving us to mope and fret alone, Avhile they are running all over the country in search of amusement; for, between ourselves, I do not believe in affairs of importance that require immediate attention.\" But Susan reserved to herself the right of animadverting upon her husband's conduct ; she would not allow even an implied censure to be passed upon him by another. With pious duplicity she asserted, that she kneAV Sir Hubert had business in the country which could not be deferred, and that it was only because his time Avould be fully occupied with bailiffs and agents of all sorts, that she had not accompanied him. In short, she took up his defence so warmly and zealously that Lucy"], [268, "260 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. was satisfied there could not be much amiss betAveen them, \u2014 a piece of intelligence Avhich she lost no time in communicating to her husband. There were not many of Lady Marston's connections in town at that time. Lady Deptford she saw for half an hour, on the passage of that lady through London from one country-house to another. They met and parted coldly, Edith receiving a sort of repri- mand from her mother for the noisy demon- strations of joy, in which she indulged at sight of her friend Susan. Mary Bertie and her husband Avere staying writh the Windermeres. Deptford was somew-here in the country, but where no one seemed to know exactly, and Susan Avas thus left to the society of the two or three of her oavu immediate friends, Avhose sojourn in London Avas rather a matter of compulsion than choice. The Windermeres, as soon as they heard of her being in town by herself, urged her to come to them during her husband's absence, but she had no heart for a large and happy family party. She dined once AA_th old Mr Digby and his daughters, and"], [269, "261 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. then invited herself for a day or tAvo to Mrs Tindal's. By that worthy lady she was received Avith maternal affection, and was installed in her old room. Mrs Tindal also made her heart glad by her praise of Sir Hubert's thoughtful attention, in leaving orders, before he Avent abroad, for the weekly despatch of a hamper of game and other contributions to her larder. \" Ah, my dear,\" she said, \" you have indeed draAvn a prize. May you both be as happy as you deserve ! \" Susan stifled a sigh. Of her happiness she said nothing, but she cordially joined in all the commendations lavished on him, Avhose image filled her heart. It was a relief to her to be able to give vent to her feelings for the absent husband, in whose presence they were always checked. She went to rest that night with a sensation of greater comfort than she had experienced for months. Lady Marston Avas not left solely to the society of her kind-hearted hostess. On the morning after her arrival a phaeton, contain ing a lady and gentleman, stopped at the"], [270, "262 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. cottage, and before the servant could announce them, Susan, as she caught a glimpse of them through the opening door, exclaimed with astonishment, \" Deptford \u2014 and Fanny Digby ! \" \" In person, my dear aunt; so pray give me your blessing ; and oblige me by introducing Miss Digby to Mrs Tindal. It will come better from your lips than mine.\" Susan complied, and then asked what it all meant. \" The fact is, Aunt Susan,\" Lord Deptford began, but Fanny cut him short \u2014 \" Lord Deptford came to town this morn ing, and hearing you were at Acton, asked Papa's leave to drive me over to pay you a visit.\" Mrs Tindal had left the room, on hospitable thoughts intent, and Lord Deptford took immediate advantage of her absence. \" Now, Fanny,\" he said, \" there is no use in beating about the bush any longer. The long and the short of it is, Aunt Susan, she has consented to marry me, and I hope you think her the luckiest Avoman in the world.\" \" I think you one of the luckiest men in the"], [271, "263 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. world,\" retorted his aunt. \"But indeed I congratulate you both most cordially and sin cerely. If he turns out as good a husband as he is a nephew, you will have no cause, Fanny, to envy any one. I advise you though to keep a tight hand on him. And when is it to be ? \" \" Ah, there,\" replied Lord Deptford, \" we are rather in a fix. I only spoke to Mr Digby this morning, and, as by my father's will I am not of age till I am five-and-twenty, he Avill not hear of our marriage till then. In fact, till then I can make no settlements. Then again he wishes me to leave the army, but as my regiment is actually under orders for Constantinople, that of course is out of the question ; I suppose therefore it must be put off till my return, unless you will join me in trying to persuade Miss Fanny to marry me out of hand, and follow the drum, or rather the trumpet.\" It was the Spring of '54. \" Do you really believe war is so near ? \" asked Susan, mentally thanking Heaven that Hubert was no longer in the army. \" War so near ! \" exclaimed Lord Deptford. \" Why, we are at war, and if you or Fanny"], [272, "264 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. have any Russian admirers, you are bound, as good patriots, to put them to death Avithout mercy.

Of course you may tell Hubert.\" \" I think you had better Avrite and tell him yourself.

They departed"], [273, "265 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. after luncheon Avithout Lady Marston's giving him the opportunity, he was evidently anxious for, of speaking to her in private. Susan joined her husband on his return from the north, but no attempt at coming to a better understanding Avas made by either of them. Apparently, they had made up their minds to continue the system they had adopted for the last feAV months ; Hubert went his way, and Susan went hers, without interfering with each other. In one thing, hoAvever, he never failed her, and that Avas her riding. In gener al, they formed part of a large party ; joining the Windermeres, the Berties, and others of their friends ; but Marston was ahvays at his post, whether from a desire to conceal their disunion from the eyes of the Avorld, or from some other motive. With this exception, they hardly ever saAv each other during the day, for Susan took to breakfasting in her own room, and her husband seldom dined at home. When they did meet, hoAvever, they conversed in a well-bred, indifferent manner upon the common topics of the day, carefully eschewing all reference to the past. But though any superficial observer, judg-"], [274, "266 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. ing from Lady Marston's calm and equable demeanour, would have pronounced her to be free from the slightest vestige of passion, cold as the perennial snoAV, which mocks and defies the summer sun, it was seeming all. Within her bosom raged at times a perfect volcano of the bitterest feelings, of hopeless love, and despondency closely bordering on despair. With no one to whom she could open her heart, or turn for consolation or ad vice ; without any near tie to bind her to earth, except the husband Avho had cast her on one side, and whose love had evidently subsided into the most complete indifference, there Avere moments when she felt utterly weary of ex istence \u2014 when her most ardent desire Avas to be removed from a Avorld in Avhich, from a child upwards, she had met Avith nothing but unhappiness and disappointment. Then again, in her irritation, she would argue, that if she had a family, friends, and relations to support her \u2014 if she was not so completely isolated, Sir Hubert Avould not have ventured to treat her as he did. But even while the thought Avas forming, she felt that she was doing him injustice ; that he Avas the last man"], [275, "267 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. on earth to take advantage of her unfriended position. If anything could have retained his love, it would have been the knoAvledge that she Avas entirely dependent upon it for every thing that made life valuable. And then her thoughts would take another turn. Hoav deeply she must have sinned against that noble, that generous nature, to have lost the love that was once hers. For that he had loved her fondly, truly, devotedly, she was certain. Perhaps it was not yet too late to regain it. A humble confession of her fault \u2014 But no, she had attempted it once, and Iioav had it been received ! She could never ex pose herself again to such unavailing humilia tion . If Susan's thoughts and feelings were so vari able, her actions Avere equally so. At first, she refused to go out anywhere; then sheAvas seized with a sudden desire to go to every party to Avhich they were invited, arriving almost the first, and being the last to take her departure. If she hoped, by her presence, to restrain her husband's philandering propensities, she was disappointed. They came together, and they went aAvay together ; but Avhen once the ball-"], [276, "268 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. room was gained, he left her as much to her self as if she had remained at home. Then she had recourse to the desperate expedient of attempting to rouse his jealousy. She had no lack of admirers on whom to bestow her smiles, but she was anything but successful in these her first attempts at flirtation. She was not to the manner bred, and Avas soon tired of listening to all the pretty speeches Avith which men of wit and men of dullness, in every age and every country, have been Avont to tickle the ears of the fair sex. The more enterprising among them Avere repelled Avith a haughtiness and unmistakable marks of displeasure, Avhich were thought out of place in one, Avho had so openly encouraged their first advances. She soon acquired a character for impertinence and caprice, which gradually thinned the ranks of her soupirans. On the last night of Lord Deptford's stay in England, he and Lady Marston met at a small party at Lady Bertie's, where he had promised to come for a few minutes to say a last good-bye to Jiis family. It Avas not a regular ball, but all Avho could were dancing,"], [277, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 269 except Susan, Avho was sitting alone in a comer, looking on, Avithout much apparent in terest, at the animated groups as they flitted past her. She made him a sign to come to her. \" Hoav late you are,\" she said. \" I had almost given you up, and was afraid I should not see you again.\" \" And I was in hopes that I should not arrive till all these people had gone. It was very unlucky that Mary should have asked them to-night. She offered to put them off, but I Avould not let her, and now I almost regret it. I cannot bear a public leave-taking, though perhaps, in some respects, it is better than a private one. I have had two this even ing \u2014 first with my mother, and then with poor, dear Fanny. She has conjured up all sorts of fancies, and has almost succeeded in infecting me [with them, too. Promise me, dear Aunt Susan, you will see as much of her as you can Avhile I am away.\" \" Depend upon me,\" said Lady Marston. \" Indeed, I have already made a beginning. Sir Hubert has given me permission to take"], [278, "270 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. her with me to Thornwood Avhen we leave London, to keep me company while he is grouse-shooting in Scotland.\" \" You should go, too. Oh, Susan, one of my greatest anxieties in leaving England is about you and Hubert.\" \" Don't ; please don't,\" she replied, placing her hand on his. \" I feel so low, so depressed to-night, that very little Avould make me break down altogether. And now that Ave have shaken hands, see for my carriage, and tell Sir Hubert that I am tired, and going home. I will send it back for him.\" Lord Deptford took her down-stairs, and put her into her carriage. She wrung his hand as they parted. \" God bless you, ' dear Deptford, for all your exceeding kindness to me. You have been to me far more a brother than a nephew.\" They wrere the last Avords he ever heard her speak. One of the first cards deposited on Sir Hubert's hall-table had been that of Mr Pen rhys. He took it up to his Avife. \" I presume you do not Avish to continue"], [279, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 271 your intimacy with this man,\" he said, with all his angry recollections revived. The phrase offended her ; and she replied coldly, \" If you imagine that any intimacy ever existed betAveen Mr Penrhys and myself, you are mistaken ; and, most assuredly, I have no Avish to begin one now.\" \" In that case you had better tell the serv ants that he is not to be admitted as a morn ing visitor.\" \" Certainly. If you will have the goodness to ring the bell, I will give my orders at once.\" But though Marston found no difficulty in regulating Mr Penrhys' position as regarded his w dfe, he did not find it so easy a matter as regarded himself. He was thoroughly con vinced that to him was OAving the ruin of his domestic happiness ; indeed, there was no one else to Avhose charge it coidd be laid, and much would he have given to be able to repay the injury in full. But how? He had no positive proof, and his Avife had refused to bear witness against the offender. He could not endure the thought of making pubhc the dis-"], [280, "272 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. cord in his household by demanding an explan- ation from Penrhys, and not for worlds would hehave run the risk of implicating Susan's name in such an equivocal business. The dearest wish of his heart was to find some opportunity of fixing a good quarrel on his enemy ; for, though the practice was not as much in vogue as it had been, the feeling still existed that, by the natural laAV, a man is authorized to exact personal reparation for offences, of which the written law takes no cognizance. At all events, these were the ideas, whether right or wrong, in which Marston had been brought up ; and had a fair opening presented itself for putting them in practice, he would have availed him- self of it Avithout the slightest scruple ; but it never did. The two met occasionally at Lady Deptford's and elseAvhere, and Sir Hubert never failed to treat his enemy Avith the most contemptuous and haughty indifference, gener- ally ignoring his presence altogether, or cut ting short every attempt he made to take part in the conversation. But though Penrhys' rage at this insulting treatment was extreme, he was too much on his guard to afford the slightest pretext for a collision which would"], [281, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 273 defeat his plans. He too sighed for a full and ample revenge for all the slights he Avas com pelled to endure, but of a less violent and uncertain nature. Mr Penrhys avoided, as well as he could without the appearance of doing so, every chance of meeting Sir Hubert, but as for Lady Marston, it really seemed as if she could not stir out of her OAvn house without coming in contact with him. She almost began to imagine that he had some occult method of discovering her intentions before they Avere formed, or of directing her movements accord ing to his will and pleasure. It was a positive persecution, from which she could not free herself Avithout coining to open Avar. In vain did she greet him with the most formal of bows, in vain did she, with something of osten tation, avoid all his attempts to shake hands Avith her, and reply to all his observations in monosyllables. Nothing seemed to discourage, or even embarrass him ; he had great tenacity of purpose, great reliance on his OAvn resources. He had determined to gain her confidence, as a preliminary to gaining her affection ; and not- Avithstanding her coldness, he persevered, in VOL. II. 18"], [282, "274 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. the full persuasion of ultimate success. The siege of Troy lasted ten years \u2014 but Troy fell at last! It Avas quite in the order of things that he should feel piqued by Susan's conduct, and he resolved to take the first opportunity of as certaining on what ground he really stood. His recollection of the time spent at Thorn wood, when she seemed to prefer his society to that of all others, was too fresh in his mind to alloAv him to believe that he Avas noAv an object of indifference to her. He attributed her present coldness of manner to any cause but the right one. It might be the result of affectation, or of her husband's injunctions, or \u2014 and this was the theory which found most favour with him \u2014 of a consciousness that she was beginning to feel too great an interest in him, and was making a last struggle with her feelings before surrender. Of one thing only could he feel certain ; he had an uncompro mising enemy in Sir Hubert, and this enemy, having, as he believed, the means in his poAver, he determined to trip up. Soon after Lord Deptford's departure, Mr Penrhys was fortunate enough to find Lady"], [283, "275 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Marston one evening alone in her opera box. She rarely, if ever, went by herself, but Lady Windermere, who had accompanied her on the present occasion, had left early for some party to Avhich she was engaged. When the door opened, and Mr Penrhys entered, Susan felt instinctively that a crisis was at hand, and prepared herself to meet it. She looked round the house, in the vain hope of seeing some one Avhom she might summon to her as sistance, to break the tete-a-tete. No auxiliary was to be had. Every eye Avas turned to the stage, and Penrhys, avIio had noticed the move ment and guessed its meaning, saw that she was in his poAver, as far as being obliged to listen to all he had to say. After a short observation or two on the merits of the performers, he opened at once upon the subject which most interested him. \" It is indeed quite an event, Lady Mar ston,\" he said, \" to find you alone ; the first time I have been so fortunate since I was your guest at Thornwood. I have called on you so often without ever obtaining admittance, that I began to think that you had pronounced a sentence of exclusion against me.\""], [284, "276 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" I find so little time for my own occupa tions, that I have been obliged to make a rule to receive no morning visitors.\" \" With the exception of Lord Deptford, I presume, for I think I have seen him enter your house just before I applied in vain for admission.\" \" With the exception of Lord Deptford and our near connections, of course.\" \" May I ask, Lady Marston, if this is your own regulation, or one suggested by Sir Hubert?\" \" Really, Mr Penrhys, I do not see what particular interest you can take in the subject, but if you wish to know, it is my own regula tion, approved by my husband.\" And she turned to the stage. But if she hoped to silence Mr Penrhys, she did not succeed. \" You ask what interest I can take in the subject. I take the interest that every man of common feeling must take in a young and beautiful woman neglected and abandoned by her husband.

If you have for gotten the hours of friendly intercourse which we passed together at Thornwood, I have not. If you now treat with coldness one whom you then honoured with your intimacy, I am not so unjust as to impute your conduct to caprice. I see in it only the result of a plan formed by others, to keep at a distance from you those Avhose advice might be of use to you in your hour of need.\" \" To Avhat, and to Avhom do you allude ? \" exclaimed Lady Marston, turning full upon him. \" Speak out, sir. You have said too much to stop half-way.\" \" Yes, I Avill speak out ; speak out in mercy to you, for the happiness of your Avhole life hangs upon a thread. If you know the truth now, it is still perhaps time to reclaim the husband Avho deceives you, who passes his evenings in dissipation, and his mornings in the company of his mistress.\" \" It is false.

I take shame to myself for having list ened to you so long, and now beg to decline all further acquaintance with you.\" She rose as she spoke. \" Lady Marston,\" he replied, with outward calm, though with rage in his heart, \" I should indeed be the basest of men, if I had ventured upon such an assertion Avithout a certainty of its truth. After what you have just said, I oAve it to myself to furnish you with proof of my veracity. Within four and twenty hours you shall have it in your OAvn power to ascer tain the correctness of my statement.\" She vouchsafed him no reply, but SAvept past him, and, finding her carriage waiting for her, returned home in a frame of mind border ing on distraction. She passed the Avhole night Avalking up and down her OAvn room, trying to disbelieve all she had heard, and yet taxing her memory for any particulars of her husband's conduct which might seem to con firm it. Of course, there Avas no lack of this sort of circumstantial evidence. One incident in particular she called to mind, of which she had thought nothing at the time, but which Avas now- urged against him with fatal effect."], [287, "279 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. She Avas in the habit, when she heard him leave the house, of placing herself in ambuscade behind one of the AvindoAv-curtains, and Avatch ing him down the street till he Avas out of sight. On one occasion, about a fortnight before, she had noticed a remarkably Avell dressed woman, whose features she could not distinguish, but whose figure was slight and graceful, pacing up and doAvn the opposite side of the street, evidently on the watch for some one. As soon as Sir Hubert closed the house door, the fair unknoAvn hurried after him and accosted him. After a feAv minutes of what appeared to be a very interesting conversation, Susan almost fancied that she saw Marston give her his hand, but of this she could not be quite sure. They then walked on, and, turn ing down a side-street together, were lost to sight. When Marston returned for their daily ride, Susan could not refrain from asking him who the stranger was, and received for answer that she was the Avife of a poor fehW he had known at the Cape, and who noAV was in London, ill and in distress. This explanation passed current at the time, but she now remembered that he had shown great embar-"], [288, "280 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. rassment when questioned on the subject, had taken some time to frame his answer, and turned the conversation as soon as possible. And Avhy should the wife of an old acquaint ance wrait for him in the street, instead of coming boldly to see him in his own house ! She now wondered at her own blindness. This woman Avas, probably, the emissary of some infamous Avoman of Sir Hubert's ac quaintance ; very likely she herself had been known to him in some disreputable capacity. No doubt he had accompanied her to her own house. How could she have forgotten to enquire ! That would have confounded him at once. Marston happened just then to be at NeAV market, and Avas not expected to return till late on the following day. Most thankful did his Avife feel for the reprieve his absence afforded her. To have been obliged to meet him, while in a state of uncertainty, was more than she could have borne. Before they again met, in all probability, her fate would be de cided ; by that time she Avould knoAv the truth or falsehood of Penrhys' tale."], [289, "281 CHAPTER XII. Lady Marston passed the long hours of the folloAving morning in a state of feverish excitement, trembling at every knock at the door, which might be the forerunner of her doom. It was not till late in the afternoon that Penrhys' servant brought her a letter marked \" most private and confidential.\" For a minute she laid it doAvn on the table, pow erless to break the seal, then in a fit of desper ation, tore it open, and read as folloAvs: \u2014 \" The Avords which you addressed to me last night, and the manner of our parting, Avould justify me in taking you at your word, and dropping your acquaintance for ever.

I will confess yet more. The deep interest I have taken in your Avelfare since we first met, the high value I set upon your friendship and esteem, make it impossible for me to remain silent under the accusation brought against me. I am no gossip, or scandal-monger, but various circum stances came to my knowledge, Avhich threw strong doubt on Sir Hubert's truth and fidelity to you. Knowing that the happiness of your whole life was at stake, I could not rest till I had investigated them, and satisfied myself of their truth or falsehood. Not till then did I feel myself justified in saying a wrord to set you on your guard, for I grieve to say that my worst suspicions Avere confirmed. My heart bleeds, Susan, for the pain I know I am giving you, but it is far better that you should know the truth \u2014 that you should endeavour to find some remedy for the ill \u2014 than that you should live on in a sort of fool's paradise, de-"], [291, "283 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. ceived by your husband, and ridiculed by the Avorld for your credulity, or blamed by it for your connivance. Your husband has a mis tress, who lives at No. 54, Como Terrace, St John's Wood. He visits her every morning, and frequently drives out with her, leaving her only in time to ride with you ; he seems to take no extraordinary precautions to preserve his se cret, which is none to those living in the neigh bourhood. You now know all that I know myself, for of the way in Avhich his nights are passed at his club or elseAA-here, you must be as well aAvare as the rest of the world. Dear Lady Marston, I know hoAv hard it is for you to bear this knowledge of Sir Hubert's mis conduct ; but you have courage and fortitude \u2014 far more than falls to the lot of most \u2014 call them to your aid, and above all do nothing rashly. Convince yourself of the truth of my statement by ocular demonstration, if possible \u2014 I have given you the means \u2014 and then consider calmly and deliberately Avhat course you ought to pursue. If you think that I can be of the slightest service to you, either by counsel or otherwise, I need not say that you may rely upon my assistance in any way in which you"], [292, "284 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. may please to command it. If you can no longer believe in the good faith of the hus band, in the devotion of the friend you may place implicit trust. H.P.\" To describe the various sensations Avith Avhich Susan read this letter Avould be impos sible. She felt that she could no longer doubt ; every sentence, every word, inflicted a fresh Avound. Indignation, contempt, wound ed pride, and above all, blighted love, took possession of her by turns. Now, indeed, she knew that her doom was fixed ; that hencefor- Avard her existence must be a dreary blank, that the years she had yet to live Avould be passed in hopeless misery, with nothing to look forward to in the future, with nothing to look back to in the past, from which she could derive consolation or relief. She had scarcely a thought to bestow on the author of the letter, which had put the finishing stroke to her happiness ; but Avhen she did think of him, it Avas with a feeling of abhorrence, for to his first slanderous tale she justly attributed her present misery. A Avhole host of contra dictory feelings took possession of her mind."], [293, "285 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. At one moment it Avas a wild desire of venge ance, a determination to make a public expo sure of Sir Hubert's misconduct, and then leave him for ever; at another, she fancied it possible \u2014 just Avithin the range of possibility \u2014 that the details mentioned by Penrhys were inventions of his oavii, that perhaps he flattered himself that, trusting to the accuracy of his state ments, she would shrink from the painful task of verifying them herself. But if so, he de ceived himself most egregiously. He had re commended her to have recourse to ocular demonstration, and ocular demonstration she would have. No sooner had this idea taken possession of her than she proceeded to give it effect. Hastily putting on a bonnet and shawl Avithout summoning her maid, or warn ing any one of her intention, she sallied out, late as it was, called a cab and bade the man drive to Como Terrace. Arrived there she got out, discharged the cab, and commenced her investigations, but Avithout any result. She had no difficulty in finding No. 54, but there her discoveries ended. It was a pretty little cottage, rather than villa, with a garden in front and behind; but the blinds were"], [294, "286 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. drawn doAvn on the ground floor, and thick curtains concealed the interior of the bed rooms. She passed it three or four times, but Avithout perceiA ring a sign of life about it ; and in her impatience, had the greatest dif ficulty in restraining herself from ringing the bell, and asking for Sir Hubert Marston. Refrain, hoA\\-ever, she did, and then endeav oured to calm the agitation of her spirits by fatiguing her body. For the next twro hours she Avalked about the streets at a pace, Avhich induced more than one of those she met to turn round, and Avatch her with evident as tonishment, It wyas past her dinner-hour when she again reached her own home, and found the Avhole household in a state of con sternation at her sudden disappearance. Mut tering something about having been out for a walk and lost her Avay, she ordered dinner to be sent up to her own room. But the first mouthful seemed to choke her; she pushed the plate away, notwithstanding the remon strances of her maid, and then fell into the same dreary round of thought in which she had been engaged for the last few hours. But in vain she endeavoured to folloAv some"], [295, "287 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. sort of order in her reflections. Her mind was in such a state of chaos that she could only repeat over and over again to herself the contents of Mr Penrhys' letter. No need to read it; every Avoid Avas stamped upon her brain in characters of fire : but the only con clusion at which she could arrive Avas that, till Sir Hubert's return, she could do nothing ; she must still remain in a state of comparative igno rance. And then the thought struck her that now he might be expected at any moment. Not for worlds Avould she have met him that night. She rang the bell, was persuaded by her maid to take a cup of tea, and then Avent to bed, leaving orders to tell Sir Hubert on his arrival that she had overtired herself, but hoped that a good night's rest would enable her to meet him at breakfast in the morning ; in conse quence, she had ordered a bed to be prepared for him in his dressing-room. For they still clung to appearances, and had not yet adopted the system of separate apartments. Little rest did she look fonvard to, but nature asserted its rights. Worn out by mental agitation and bodily fatigue, long be fore her husband returned she had fallen into"], [296, "288 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. a profound slumber, which lasted some hours. Had her sleep been lighter, she might have been aware of some one entering her room with a cautious step, and kissing her feverish cheek ; her ears might have caught a few Avoids of blessing softly murmured over her head. To carry out her plan, Susan lent herself, for the first time in her life, to a course of dissimu lation, as repugnant to her feelings as it was contrary to her disposition. When she Avoke, it Avas Avith a beating heart and the consciousness of some impending evil, though, for the first few minutes, she was unable to realize its nature. Then it all rushed upon her at once ; and for a moment she buried her face in her pilloAV, with a despairing sensation of utter and irre trievable misery. But soon a sterner feeling took possession of her ; and she determined, at any cost to herself, to unmask the author of her unhappiness. For now all doubts seemed to have vanished, and she looked upon her husband as the destroyer of her peace \u2014 as her bitterest enemy. The very love which still filled her heart only made him the more culpable in her eyes. To avenge her"], [297, "289 SIR HUBERT MARSTCN. wrongs all means were allowable. He had deceived her ; and by deceit she Avould attain her ends. The weapons he had used should be turned against himself. Thus resolved, she regained to a certain extent her self-possession. She met Sir Hubert with a placid brow, though with an inward shudder when he kissed her forehead ; listened with seeming interest to Avhat he had done at Newmarket, and enquired at wThat hour he had returned. \" Long after you were in bed,\" he replied. \" I was so sorry to hear that you had over tired yourself. Your walk was too much for you, and now that I have returned, you must resume your riding instead.\" \" I do not feel equal to a ride to-day. I shall go out for a drive.\" \" Well, to tell you the truth, to-day that suits me just as Avell, for I have some busi ness after breakfast which may make me a little late.\" With difficulty she restrained her feelings, for she guessed the nature of his business, but she replied, calmly enough, \" It suits us both, then.\" VOL. II. 19"], [298, "290 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" I want to call on Mrs Digby,\" he said, as he was leaving the room after breakfast. \" If I can get back in time, perhaps you will take me to Kensington ; but do not wait a minute for me, as the time of my return is uncertain.\" As soon as she heard his steps on the last flight of the stairs, Susan ran up to her own room, arrayed herself in the simplest walking attire she possessed, and then sat down at the window to watch for her hus band's egress from the house. She had not long to wait ; and as soon as he was in the street she fleAv, rather than ran, down-stairs, gently opened the house-door, and was just in time to see him turn the corner into a side street. Hurrying on, she reached the same point, and found herself some fifty or sixty yards behind him. A cab was passing, Avhich she called and got into, giving instructions to the driver to follow the gentleman in front of her, preserving always the same distance, and promising ample remuneration. After walk ing for about ten minutes, Sir Hubert stopped at the gate of a livery stable-keeper, and making a sign to some one in attendance, a brougham, which Avas evidently in readiness,"], [299, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 291 drove out, into which he got. Apparently, there was no need for orders to the coach man, who, as soon as the door was closed, moved off at a pace which threatened to leave Cabby nowhere. And, in fact, soon after they crossed Oxford Street, the chase was lost sight of altogether. No. 43,221 pulled up, and communicated the fact to his passenger, ex pecting a severe reprimand ; but Susan only told him to drive as fast as he could to Como Terrace, St John's Wood, and stop at the corner. As she expected, the brougham was in waiting before No. 54, and she now had to consider her next step. She had almost made up her mind to drive up to the house, and surprise the delinquents in the midst of their iniquity, when the door opened, and Sir Hubert again made his appearance with a lady on his arm, Avhom he handed into the carriage, and followed himself. Again the brougham drove off, but at a more lei surely pace, so that the cab Avas able to keep it in vieAv Avithout any difficulty. In this order they arrived at the Zoological Gar dens, where the brougham stopped, and Mar ston handing out his incognita, they both"], [300, "292 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. entered the Gardens, followed by Susan, who-, trusting to the shawl in which, notAvithstand ing the heat of the weather, she had envel oped herself, and her thick veil, Avas deter mined to pursue the adventure to the end. It so happened that the Gardens Avere croAvded. Some unhappy brute, hitherto un known on this side of the equator, had been torn from its cheerful fireside and attached family, to gratify the thirst for knowledge with which the British public is inflamed ; and all London rushed to make its acquaintance. The hour, however, Avas too early for the beau monde, and Marston roamed about with his companion, without much risk of meeting any one he knew. Favoured by the crowTd, his Avife contrived to keep close to them, and was able to examine her rival. She saw a remark ably lady-like person, rather under the middle size, about twenty years of age, and with fea tures not boasting of much regularity or beauty when examined separately, but singu larly attractive from their expression. To her astonishment, Lady Marston failed to detect in her anything like^boldness or even freedom"], [301, "293 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. of manner ; on the contrary, there was some thing subdued, and even sad in her demean our, Avhich in any one else would have excited Susan's sympathy. As it was, it only increased her indignation against him Avhom she con sidered as the cause of it. At times, hoAvever, when any observation was addressed to her by Sir Hubert, the eyes of the fair un known lighted up, a smile swept across her countenance, and at those moments it must have been a very fastidious critic who would have denied her claims to beauty. Thus they Avandered on from cage to cage, from house to house ; Susan's excitement in creasing at every step, for she followed the pair quite near enough to notice that they Avere on terms of the most familiar intimacy, and to hear them address each other as Ellen and Hubert. But the severest trial was yet to come. The two culprits sat down on a bench for a few minutes, while Lady Marston re mained standing at a short distance behind them, effectually screened from view by a few intervening shrubs. All at once she heard her -own name mentioned."], [302, "294 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" I only hope,\" said a feminine voice, with something like a laugh, \" that Susan will not find us out.\" \" I sincerely hope she will not,\" replied Sir Hubert, gravely, and without any indication of mirth in his tone. ThisAvas too much. Notwithstanding all Su san had hitherto heard and witnessed, she had maintained a control over her actions, which in one of her temperament was almost miracul ous, but when she heard the shameless wo man, Avho had usurped her place in Hubert's heart, call her by her Christian name, and make her the subject of an insolent jest, and above all, when he, to Avhom the observation was addressed, permitted it to pass without reproof, she could refrain no longer. She made one step in advance, but at that moment her hand was seized, while a voice she thought familiar to her, whispered in her ear \u2014 \"Not noAv, not now, Lady Marston. You have seen and heard enough to satisfy you of my veracity, but for your own sake you must reflect before you act.\" \" You here, Mr Penrhys ! \" she said, greatly"], [303, "295 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. startled, but in a voice low as his own, \"What brings you here at such a time ? \" For a moment her surprise Avas so great that it drove everything else out of her mind, and unconsciously she allowed him to lead her to a short distance ; but before he again addressed her, recollection returned, and with it her aversion and distrust of her self constituted guardian. Now, for the first time, did the difficulty of her position, between Penrhys on one side and her husband on the other, present itself to her in its full force. Snatching away her hand, which he still re tained, she sank into a seat and covered her face with both hands. She felt like a bird driven by some irresistible agency into the toils of the fowler. \" You will not wonder at my being here,\" Mr Penrhys replied, \" when I tell you that I passed the brougham containing Sir Hubert and his companion, and immediately after wards the cab with you in it. Instantly di vining your purpose, I determined to MIoav, in case you should need assistance. Do you think, Susan, I could leave you in such a"], [304, "296 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. situation without support ! You have seen enough. Let us noAv leave the Gardens, and consider what is to be done, now that you knoAv the truth.\" If Mr Penrhys had been inclined to be per fectly open and ingenuous, he would have said that he had been watching the Marstons' house the whole morning, and that he had followed Susan from her OAvn door. But in his judg ment such a disclosure was neither called for nor desirable. To Penrhys' proposal to leave the Gardens Lady Marston made no answer, unless indeed by a low moan. \" Will you allow me to offer you my arm ? \" he continued. \" No, no, leave me,\" was the only response he obtained. \" But you cannot remain here, Lady Mar ston. And indeed it would be useless, for the others are gone.\" Susan lifted up her head, and saw that it Avas true. The bench so lately occupied in front of her was vacant. She started up and began moving away, but took the Avrong"], [305, "297 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. direction. Penrhys was at her elbow in a moment. \"You are going wrong,\" he said. \"You had better put yourself under my guidance.\" She Avalked on by his side mechanically, Avithout uttering a Avord. \" You will allow me to see you home,\" he persisted. \" No, no, leave me,\" was again her reply. He saAv that for the moment nothing more was to be gained. \" At least, you will allow me to call on you, and talk this sad business over.\" \" Yes, yes, only leave me.\" \" Shall I come this evening, or to-morrow morning ? \" \"Yes, yes; either or both, \u2014 I do not care. It is all one to me. Only leave me now.\" \" Very w7ell then, this evening about nine o'clock, and let me entreat of you to do and say nothing till then.\" They reached the gate just in time to see Sir Hubert's brougham drive off. Mr. Pen rhys put Lady Marston into a cab, and gave the driver the necessary directions. How she reach-"], [306, "298 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. ed her own house, hoAv she found her way to her own room, she had no idea. She had a vague feeling that the worst part of her struggle was to come, and she endeavoured to nerve herself to meet it. One interview with her husband, probably the last, was unavoidable. She would leave his house, but in justice to herself she must assign her reasons. She must let him know that his misconduct, his treachery, Avere no longer a secret, and then she would bid him adieu for ever, without upbraiding, with out reproaches, with the calm indifference of contempt ! Whilst schooling herself for the part she was to enact, she heard Sir Hubert's well knoAA-n knock, and hastened doAvn to the draw ing-room to be in readiness to confront him. He came up-stairs with a light, joyous spring. \" Not gone yet ? \" he exclaimed, as he entered the room. \" I was afraid I should be too late.\" \" I am not going out,\" replied Lady Mars ton. \" I hope you have finished your business satisfactorily.\" \" Perfectly so. Nothing could have gone off better,\" he replied, while a sort of half smile played upon his countenance."], [307, "299 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Susan Avaited for no more. This was the match which fired the mine. Farewell to all attempted calmness or disdainful indifference! She gave full vent in no measured terms to all the feelings of Avhich she had been the victim for months. She told him that she had been Avarned of his baseness, that, though dis believing the accusation, the proofs thrust up on her notice were so strong that she deter mined upon investigating them herself; and she then gave a full account of the way in Avhich she had traced him to Como Terrace, and thence to the Zoological Gardens, con cluding by thanking God that her eyes had at last been opened to his villany, Avhich had now turned all the affection she had once felt for him into loathing and contempt. In vain did Sir Hubert attempt to interrupt the torrent of reproaches with which she over whelmed him. It was not till she stopped, thoroughly exhausted Avith her own violence, that he was able to make himself heard, and Avhen at length he could speak, it was not in the tone of a convicted offender. \" I am shocked,\" he said, \"that you should have con descended to play the spy upon your husband,"], [308, "300 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. and that you should put so false a construction on his actions. If you think appearances against me I am sorry for it, but I am not at liberty to explain them now, nor, to say truth, challenged as I am, Avould I, if I could. As for the lady with whom you saw me, you may believe me when I tell you she is in every way entitled to your respect.\" \" To my respect !\" exclaimed Susan, Avith a sarcastic laugh, wdiich ill concealed her still in creasing irritation. \"I may believe that, may I ? No, Sir Hubert, thank you. It may be very convenient to say that, though appear ances are against you, you are not at liberty to explain them ; but the days of belief, or rather of credulity, are passed, and I have yet to learn how Sir Hubert Marston's mistress is entitled to his wife's respect.\" The colour rose in Marston's cheeks, but he still maintained command over his temper. \" It is not true that the lady with whom you saw me or any other is my mistress. Be Avarned in time, Lady Marston, or the day Avill come when you will bitterly repent your present words.\" The warning was given in vain. Susan's"], [309, "301 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. passion completely mastered her, and drove her beyond all bounds. \" I do not believe you,\" she exclaimed. \"You told me you Avere going out on business, and it was a lie. You Avent to visit your mistress. For she is your mistress ; your Ellen, as you call her. And you alloAV her to make her jokes upon me. Good God, that such a woman should dare to call me Susan ! And you stood by and heard it unmoved ! What have you to say noAv ? Perhaps you will deny this, too, liar ! \" For a moment Marston looked as if stunned. \u2014 It was the first time in his life so op probrious an epithet had ever been applied to him. \u2014 But by a violent effort of will he retained his outward composure, though his voice was almost inarticulate from emotion. \" I have only this to say, Lady Marston,\" he replied ; \" You may spare yourself and me the further disgrace of using such language, for you have succeeded in what has, no doubt, long been your object. We now separate for ever ; for no human power shall ever induce me to pass an other night under the same roof with one who has so grossly insulted me.

I forgive your unjust suspicions, your injurious words, but I will never volun tarily see you again. May God give you happier days than you have known with me.\" In another minute he had left the house."], [311, "303 CHAPTER XIII. For some short space Lady Marston stood gazing at the door through which her husband had disappeared, as if transfixed, more like a statue than a being possessed of life and consciousness ; then, writh a piercing shriek, she threw herself on the floor. Although for the last two hours she had kept repeating to herself that Sir Hubert's disloyalty was proved beyond the shadow of a doubt, that a separation was inevitable, she was now aware that a hope had still remained, concealed at the bottom of her heart, that he might be able to justify himself, that he Avould at least attempt some explanation of his equivocal conduct. She even fancied that if he had confessed his guilt, and implored her pardon,"], [312, "304 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. it would not have been long withheld. But now every hope was gone. Not only had he refused all explanation, but he had assumed the tone of the injured party. From being the accused, he became the accuser, replying to reproach by reproach ; and he had con cluded by pronouncing a sentence of separ ation, which, Avith her knowledge of his character, she felt to be irrevocable. The be trayer had assumed the functions of judge ; the betrayed could only accept her doom in silence. She could make no allowance for the irritation produced by her words. She only saw in his conduct a determination to seize the first excuse for freeing himself from a yoke that had long been irksome to him. Under the influence of these feelings she rose from the ground, and seating herself at the table, Avrote these lines \u2014 \" Keep your house \u2014 keep your money. Whatever you may think, it was not for them I married you. My own income will be suffi cient for my wants ; should it fail, I can earn my bread by my labour, as I have done before ; but not to save myself from starvation would"], [313, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 305 I accept from you a crust of bread, or a glass of water. Would to God you had left me to die on the pavement Avhere we first met ! \" She put this note into a cover, directed it to Sir Hubert Marston, Bart., sealed it, and left it in a conspicuous position on the table. She then Avent to her own room, resumed the attire she had worn in the morning, put a few things into a small carpet-bag, opened her writing-desk, put Avhat money she had into her pocket, and Avithout an attempt at con cealment, walked down-stairs, and let herself out into the street Avithout having met any of the servants. All was done with the greatest deliberation. If she Avas mad, there was method in her madness. Taking the first cab she met, she told the man to take her to the station. \" To London Bridge, miss ? \" he asked. Lady Marston bowed her head in assent. One station Avas to her the same as another. She literally cared not what became of her. As long as she was in motion, it was all she desired. Having arrived, and discharged the cab, she entered the office. A lady was just be- VOL.

They found themselves alone, and took their seats in opposite corners. The train was soon in motion, and then Susan, who had drawn her veil close over her face, began to retrace in her mind all that had occurred in the last eventful eight-and-forty hours ; and an appalling retrospect it was. Two days ago, she was, if not happy, at least comparatively tranquil in mind ; surrounded by every com fort and luxury ; occupying a position in the world Avhich most would have thought an object of envy ; with a courteous, if not affec tionate, husband, house, servants, and friends. Now, she Avas a wandering outcast, Avithout a home \u2014 without a tie upon earth. By her de sertion of her husband's house, she felt that she had broken entirely Avith the world, \u2014 per haps was the object of its ill-report. Hitherto she had not shed a tear ; but Avhen the sense of her desolate condition took possession of her, her fortitude gave way ; she wrung her"], [315, "307 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. hands, and burst into such a passionate agony of grief, that her whole frame was convulsed. Her agitation Avas so great that it could not escape the attention of her unknown com panion \u2014 a lady of considerable beauty, and still young, although a care-worn appearance made her look older than she really was. She laid doAvn a book she Avas reading, and crossed over to the seat next to that occupied by Susan. Taking one of her hands, she said, \" My dear young lady, I am afraid you are in great suffering or in great affliction. Is there anything I can do for you ? \" There Avas no mistaking the tone of sym pathy in Avhich these few words Avere uttered, and they Avent straight to Susan's heart : it was so long since she had heard words of genuine kindness. But she could not make a confidant of a stranger. \" No, no, thank you,\" she said, but Avith out AvithdraAving her hand. \" I am quite well. It Avas only a foolish feeling that made me give Avay.\" The lady did not seem to be convinced ; she shook her head."], [316, "308 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" It can be no light or foolish feeling that produced such a burst of soitoav. Nay, for give me,\" she continued, as Susan made a gesture of impatience ; \" forgive me if I pain you. I Avould fain speak words of comfort to you if I could, for I, too, have known grief.\" \" But not such as mine,\" exclaimed Susan, again bursting into tears. \" No one \u2014 no one in the whole Avorld has felt such grief as mine, such utter desolation of heart. For me there is no comfort, no hope.\" \" Oh, say not so. For all there are hope and consolation, if we only look for them where they are to be found. I too once thought as you did, but I have at length found happiness and peace.\" \" Ah, yes, perhaps ; but you have not \u2014 \" she stopped suddenly. \" Thank you, thank you for your kindness, but I cannot talk of this now. Do not think me rude, but I had rather say no more. I do not think I quite know Avhat I am saying, but I feel so weary. I think I will try to sleep.\" If possible, it was clearly the best thing that could befall her. The stranger threw her oavii"], [317, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 309 shawl over her, and did her best to make her comfortable. At length her sobs ceased, and she fell into a sleep which lasted some time, although occasionally broken by heavy sighs. They were now fast approaching the station of Highbeach, Avhere the railway made rather a sharp curve. Already the speed was slack- ened, and the passengers who intended to go no further, were beginning to gather up their bags and baskets, Avhen suddenly there Avere unmistakable signs of something Avrong. Porters were seen rushing about, waving flags of every hue ; the station-master in a state of frantic dismay, was making signs and issuing orders to everybody in and out of hearing ; the engine screeched and whistled at the top of its voice ; the break was strained to the utmost. All in vain ! Some trucks full of pigs stood on the line where they had no business to be, and the consequence Avas that the down-train ran into them with great force, the engine and tender, with the leading carriages, were forced off the rail and upset, and the others throAvn into the greatest confusion. Fortunately the accident was not attended Avith loss of human life. The remonstrances of the pigs, indeed,"], [318, "310 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. during the process of their untimely conver sion into pork, were distressing in the extreme. The stoker Avas severely scalded ; but with the exception of two or three legs and tAvo or three arms broken, a fractured collar-bone or two, half-a-dozen ribs stove in, and as many con tusions more or less severe, no great harm was done. It is consolatory to be able to add that, after a searching inquiry, it Avas officially de clared that not a shadow of blame could attach to any one; unless indeed to the pas sengers, who had been venturesome enough to trust their lives and limbs to so precarious a mode of conveyance. The carriage in which Lady Marston travel led was one of those overturned. The lady Avho Avas with her sustained no injury, beyond fright and bewilderment. Susan was not so fortunate. She had struck her head violently against the Avoodwork of the carriage, and Avas lying insensible across the seat. As soon as her companion had recovered a little from her alarm, she cast her eyes around her, and per ceiving Susan's condition, tried to raise her up. They were close to the station, and at"], [319, "311 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. this moment one of the officials looked into the carriage, and, touching his hat, said \u2014 \" I hope your Ladyship is not hurt ? \" \" No, I believe there is nothing the matter with me, but this lady has received some severe injury. Assist me to get her out, and send for a fly. I shall take her to my OAvn house.\" With the assistance of a couple of the porters Avho Avere at hand, the two ladies Avere extricated from their prison, and Susan, still insensible, Avas carried with her bag to a fly that had driven up, into Avhich the lady follow ed her, and directed the driver to Ivy Cottage, having previously despatched a messenger to summon Dr Baird, her oavii medical attendant, as speedily as possible. On arriving at home, before even answering the enquiries of her wondering servants, she saw Susan carried up to her own room; and then, with the assistance of her maid, undressed her and laid her in her own bed. She then sat down to await the arrival of Dr Baird. She was not kept long waiting. The doctor, an old army-surgeon, who was really a clever"], [320, "312 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. man, soon made his appearance, and after a few preliminary enquiries, commenced his exa mination of the patient. After a few anxious minutes, he turned round to the mistress of the house. \" We shall do very well, I hope,\" he said. \" She has received a severe bloAv on the head, and there is a slight concussion of the brain, but if she is kept perfectly quiet, I have no doubt that by to-morrow all the worst symp toms will have disappeared. Is she a friend or relation of your Ladyship's ? \" \" No ; I never saw her before. We travel led alone in the same carriage, and I fear, poor thing, she is in great affliction. Of course, Avhen I saAv what had happened, I took charge of her.\" \"Just like you,\" said Baird, taking her hand, \" 'I Avas a stranger, and you took me in ; sick, and you visited me.' But I fear your hospi tality will be tried more perhaps than you expect, for she will not be fit to move for some days.\" \" She will be Avelcome,\" she replied, simply. \" Well, then, I will send you up some medicine which you must get her to take, if"], [321, "313 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. you can, and ice for her head ; but the best remedy Avill be perfect repose. There are some signs of returning consciousness, but you must impose absolute silence on her till I see her in the morning. And now I must take my leave, for there are other sufferers I must attend to. These railroads are blessed institu tions for us doctors.\" During the night, the lady never left the room. Before morning her charge began to groAV restless, and it Avas evident that percep tion was beginning to daAvn upon her. It was intensely- hot, and through the window, Avhich w^as partially opened behind the curtains, came the hollow murmuring of the advancing and receding Avaves. Susan gazed in AAronder ment around her, and made some attempt to speak. In a moment the lady was at her bed side. \" My dear,\" she said, \" you are not to utter a word till the doctor has seen you in the morning. Be contented now to know that you have escaped a fearful accident, and are amongst friends.\" Some murmured sound escaped Susan's lips, and before long she either fell into a doze, or appeared to do so, of Avhich her kind"], [322, "314 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. nurse took advantage to resign her post to her maid for some short time. At an early hour Dr Baird paid his pro mised visit, and was perfectly satisfied with the progress his patient had made. \" She does your Ladyship's nursing infinite credit,\" he said, when he entered the sitting-room. \" She is now quite conscious, and I think that you ought to find out Avho she is, that her friends may be written to. I need not say that all prolonged conversation and, above all, all agitating topics must be avoided.\" As soon as he left the house, the mistress of it proceeded to execute the task imposed upon her ; though, from AArhat she had seen in the course of their journey, she anticipated no slight difficulty in executing it satisfactorily. When she entered the sick room, Susan was awake, and evidently recognized her visitor. Dismissing the maid, the lady approached the bed. \" My dear child,\" she said, \" I am indeed delighted to see you so much better, and if you can iioav listen to me without too much fatigue, I will explain to you where you are, and how you came here. Do you re-"], [323, "315 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. member anything that occurred on the rail- \" Not distinctly,\" replied Susan, in a Ioav, feeble tone of voice. \" I think I was asleep, and woke suddenly. I remember nothing further.\" \"So far your recollection is correct. There was a frightful accident, and you received a bloAv on your head which stunned you. By God's mercy I was unhurt, and brought you to my oWn house. I am Lady Marston \u2014 \" \" You, Lady Marston ! \" exclaimed Susan, trying in vain to raise herself in bed. \" What, then, am \u2014 \" \" Yes, I am Lady Marston,\" continued that lady, not heeding the interruption, \" the widow of Sir Charles Marston. I have lived for the last two years in Highbeach, and most happy did I think myself in having a home to offer you.\" \" Lady Marston ! \" again repeated Susan. \" What ! Are you Caroline Wood ? \" \" That was indeed my name,\" she replied, in great astonishment. \"But Avho then are you, Avho seem to knoAV me so Avell ? \""], [324, "316 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. For a moment Susan was silent. Her colour went and came, and her fingers clutched convulsively at the bed-clothes. Then burst ing into tears, \" I too am Lady Marston,\" she said. \" Sir Hubert Marston's most miserable wife.\" \"Sir Hubert Marston!\" exclaimed the other. \" Good Heavens, how extraordinary ! I heard he Avas married ; but how is it possible you could be travelling alone ? \" Then seeing Susan's agony, and recollecting herself, she said, \" Where is Sir Hubert now ? He must be Avritten to at once.\" \" Not for Avorlds. Promise me to keep my secret. Ah, I see you will not. You will betray me too. But I will leave your house this instant.\" She made a vain effort to rise. \" Oh, my God, have mercy on me. Give me strength for one hour, one little hour, and I ask no more.\" And there flashed such a strange light from her eyes, that it looked almost like insanity. Caroline Marston was thoroughly frightened. She had unconsciously done the very thing against which she had been cautioned, and"], [325, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 317 produced an excitement which might be pro ductive of the worst consequences. \"No, Lady Marston,\" she said, stooping over her and kissing her forehead, \" I will not betray you. Till you allow me to reveal it, I will keep your secret, without even asking its nature. You will trust me, Avill you not?\" \" Yes, yes, I trust you. Oh my God 1 Such goodness, such kindness from you, Avhose very name I have sometimes hated.\" \" Hated me ! hated my name ! And why?\" \" Ah, because he loved you. But I must tell you all.\" \" Not now. You are too much agitated to enter upon such a subject now. Try to com pose yourself, and by-and-by you shall tell me all you desire to tell me. But remember, it is your own wish. I am quite content to have you here Avithout knowing more.\" But in the afternoon Susan again reverted to the subject, and, touching lightly on her early days, gave the whole history of the last years of her life, from her first acquaintance Avith Sir Hubert till the closing scene. She did not spare herself, she did full justice to"], [326, "318 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. her husband's many noble qualities, but she certainly painted his delinquencies in the blackest colours. \" And now,\" she exclaimed, when she had finished, \" do you not think I was right ? Was it possible for me to remain in the house of a man who had deceived me, avIio had outraged me, who gloried in the Avrongs he had inflicted on me; on me, his Avife ; and who could cast me off in that heartless, unfeeling manner ! Ah, how I loved him once ; Iioav I honoured him above all created beings ! And to think that I would accept his money ! I would rather starve ! \" \" I think,\" replied Caroline, \" that there has been some fatal mistake ; that you have been deceived by appearances. From Avhat I knew of Sir Hubert, he is the last man in the Avorld to have acted as you suppose, unless he is greatly changed. And his nature was not one to change. Believe me, you have wronged him.\" \"What!\" exclaimed Susan, starting up. \" Is it because you still love him that you take his defence?\" Caroline Marston coloured painfully, but"], [327, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 319 f she replied with all the composure she could assume, \" Certainly not. On the contrary, it is be cause I am quite disinterested and impartial that I am perhaps better able to judge clearly than yourself. But as you have so pointedly alluded to the relation in which I once stood to Sir Hubert, let me assure you, not only that I do not love him in the way you mean, but that I am now convinced that I never felt for him the love, that a woman ought to feel for the man whom she wishes to make her hus band. I was very young, very vain, and not over-wise. We had lived much together as children, and afterwards I was flattered by his attentions, as who would not have been, for I have seldom met with any one of more attractive manners, or more universally liked by men and Avomen. But our engagement was a thought less act, one which, circumstanced as we then were, there was no hope of realizing. He was in debt, writh little besides his pay, and I had nothing. I do not reproach myself for having broken it off. The great, the fatal mistake I made Avas in marrying his brother. I do not attempt to excuse it, for it was inexcusable."], [328, "320 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. But I tried to do my duty to my husband Avhile he lived, and I trust I succeeded. At least I have the consolation of knoAving that his last words to me were Avords of kindness and affection. I have told you all this, be cause, connected as we are, and especially after the confidence you have placed in me, you had a right to know it, but do not let us revert to it, for it is a painful subject to us both.\" \" Never, never. I feel you speak the truth. Forgive me for my rudeness, but I think it is my fate to wound all those Avho show me kindness by my hasty Avords. And I know how good you are. I knoAv hoAv Avell you are remembered, hoAv much you are loved at Thornwood. Ah, what Avill they say of me ! \" \"And noAv, Susan \u2014 you must let me call you Susan, for we are sisters ; Avill you accept me as such?\" \" Oh, so thankfully,\" she cried with tears in her eyes. \" Why does God always raise me up a friend, when I am most in need of one ! \" Because He loves you ; because He tries no one beyond his strength. But, Susan, there is another point in which I Avish you to be"], [329, "321 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. guided by me. I promised to keep your secret, and I will. No one shall know where you are, and no one here shall know who you are, unless by your own consent ; but I much Avish \u2014 I ask it as a favour \u2014 that you would allow me to reveal it to one very dear friend, for whose discretion I can answer as for my own.\" \"But why?\" asked Susan feebly. \"I will have no secrets from my sister. Because before long I shall be his wife, and I feel I ought not to keep a matter of so much importance from him. I have also another reason. Sir Hubert must know that you are safe and in good hands. Hear me out before you speak,\" she added, as she saw Susan open- ing her lips. \" Consider his uneasiness, the agony of mind he must be enduring at this moment. Even supposing, which I do not believe, that you are no longer as dear to him as you were, your sudden disappearance, the uncertainty of your fate, must be inflicting on him torments, under which many a strong mind has sunk. Do you wish for his death, or worse ? And what will the wrorld say ? for VOL. II. 21"], [330, "322 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Ave must not entirely disregard public opinion. It is your duty to enable your husband to de fend the fair fame of his Avife, if attacked.\" Susan covered her eyes with her hands, as these thoughts were presented to her mind. Her heart was softening a little to her hus band, for Caroline's Avords had not been alto gether Avithout effect, and she admitted that it was just possible that she might have been deceived by appearances. But this idea cut both ways. If, on the one hand, she could still feel that she had a husband whom she could love and reverence, on the other, it made her offence against him still more grievous, and one which it was little likely he would ever pardon. She remembered AAath terrible dis tinctness the Avords in wiiich he had pro nounced judgment against her, and she kneAV how tenaciously he adhered to his decisions even in small things ; Iioav much more, then, on such a point as this ! Conscience too Avhis pered to her Iioav miserable his home had been for the last few months. No Avonder he was glad to escape from it and her. After a short silence she said, \" Yes, I feel"], [331, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 323 you are right, and I place myself in your hands entirely ; but how can it be managed without his finding out Avhere I am?\" \" Well, this is what I have imagined. If you see any objections you will say so. My friend, the Dean of Newport, is going to toAvn this evening. He -will come to take leave of me before his departure, and I will tell him the whole story ; under the strictest injunctions of secresy, of course. To-morroAV morning he shall call upon your husband, and simply say that you are in safety, and in re spectable hands. If questioned, he will say that he is not at liberty to give any further information. Does this satisfy you ? \" \" Yes, I think so. But ask him to tell you everything Hubert says.\" \" I will. Would you like to see him your self . when he calls ? He is used to sick 3? rooms. \"No, not now. Dear Caroline, may you be happy with him, \u2014 if you are not afraid of the good wishes of one so Avretched as my self\" \" Thank you, dearest. So far from being"], [332, "324 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. afraid of them, I take them as an omen of future happiness for yourself, when this cloud shall have blown over. There is one other point to settle. If you do not wish to be known here, you must take some other name. What shall it be ? \" It gave Susan a fresh pang to be obliged to drop the name of which she had once been so proud ; but it was inevitable. She pleaded hard to be allowed to call herself Mrs Mar ston, but Caroline represented that it might give rise to many inconvenient enquiries. As a sort of compromise, she adopted the rather transparent pseudonym of Mrs Hubert. END OF VOL. II. JOHN CHILDS AND SON, PRINTERS."], [333, ""], [334, ""], [335, ""], [336, ""]]
