Mrs. Wood was more amenable to reason than her daughter had given her credit for. It is true that, when Annie recounted her little adventure, she had to undergo a very mild lecture for her imprudence in confiding the secrets of her home so freely to a stranger, but in her heart Mrs. Wood was not sorry sor the chance which had again thrown her daughter and Walter Caryll together. The solitude in which she lived was rather en forced than of her own choice.

In her present position she felt an invincible repugnance to meeting those, with whom she had once associated on a footing of equality. As regarded Walter Caryll, the case was different. He had for many months been a member of her family, during which time, as he had reminded Annie, he had contrived to establish himself firmly in her good graces, and had been favoured with more than his share of the maternal solicitude which she extended to all her husband's pupils. Besides, when a young man does seek the society of those whom he had known in their better days, whatever the motive may be, most assuredly it is not from a wish to spy out the nakedness of the land, or to make invidious comparisons. She felt grateful to Walter for the attention which he had just shown her daughter, and the wish he had expressed to renew his acquaintance with herself. . These were the considerations which influenced her"], [11, "3 THE CARYLLS. as to the present, but she had seen enough of the world to have imbibed some of its wisdom, and she cast a glance at the future. It was possible that this chance meeting might be the means of rescuing Annie from a life of toil and drudgery, by raising her to a position, if not of wealth and luxury, at least of com fort and independence. She knew that Walter Caryll was one of a numerous family not overburthened with riches, but she also knew that he had entered upon a career which might lead to affluence and honours. The papers had informed her that he was now the brother in-law of Lord Brentford, the future Earl of Isleworth, and no doubt amongst his connec tions there must be some who had the power, as well as the will, to assist him in making his way in the world. Moreover, she was one of those happily, or unhappily, constituted individuals who think that a great deal of love will go far to supply the deficiencies of a small income. In short, she decided in her own mind that Walter Caryll was the very husband for her daughter. She had remarked B 2"], [12, "4 THE CARYLLS. at Lynburn his evident admiration of Annie \u2014 when is a mother's eye ever blind to such indications ?\u2014 and she saw no reason why their intimacy should not now be renewed and fostered, with a view to its bringing forth fruit in due season. If this reasoning smacked a little of the wisdom of the serpent, it may be forgiven her, for her object was her daugh ter's welfare 5 if not a very wise, she was a fond mother. It is needless to say that, when Walter paid his promised visit on the following day, his reception was as warm and cordial as he could have desired. On some pretence or other, a holiday had been proclaimed ; there was nothing to interrupt the long and interesting conversation in which they were all three soon engaged ; and it was not till the clock struck four that WTalter awoke to the convic tion that his visit had been prolonged till it became a visitation. \" Your fault entirely, Mrs. Wood,\" he said, on rising to take leave, \" for encouraging my chattering propensities.\" Then Annie whispered something to her"], [13, "5 THE CARYLLS. mother, and that good lady announced that it was their dinner hour, that in five minutes a beef-steak pudding would smoke upon the board, and that, as Mr. Caryll had probably passed his usual hour for luncheon, he had better remain and have some with them. \"Well,\" he said, \"I certainly do feel hungry ; and if I were quite certain that I should not be iu the way \u2014 \" His scruples were very easily silenced, and it was not for another good hour that he thought of moving. \" Now that I have found you out, Mrs. Wood,\" he said, on shaking hands with her, \" I hope that you will allow me to repeat my visit.\" \" We shall always be glad to see you,\" she replied ; \" but I fear our hours will hardly suit you. We are occupied all day, and could not receive you till the evening, after six o'clock, when you, no doubt, have other engagements.\" \" No, indeed.

He had ample time for meditation, for by taking the wrong turn when he left Mrs. Wood's door, he found himself involved in the mazes of Lisson Grove before he discovered his mistake. His first and paramount feeling was that of intense comr.iiseration for his old friends, and con cern for the reverses which had befallen them \u2014 reverses borne, not only with resignation, but with dignity \u2014 for, beyond a very natural burst of grief when alluding to Mr. Wood's death, not a word of lamentation or repining had escaped either mother or daughter. And yet the time was not so far distant when they were in the possession of a good income, with a comfortable house over their heads, friends, servants, and even the luxury of a brougham \u2014 for Mr. Wood, the simplest of men in his own tastes, was indulgent to a fault as a husband and father. As long as he was left at peace in his own den, he was glad"], [15, "THE CARYLLS. 7 to know that the other inmates of the house were amusing themselves either at home or abroad. They had many pleasant and sociable families, abounding in young people of both sexes, living around them, and few were the evenings which were not devoted to merry making of some sort or other. Mrs. Wood's hospitality and popularity went hand-in-hand, while Annie's beauty, good-humour, and attractive manners, made her a general favourite. When Walter had last seen her, she was not only one of the leading members of Lynburn society, but was received on a footing of equality in some of the most aristo cratic houses of the county magnates.

He could not refrain from instituting a comparison between her lot in life and that of Annie Wood ; the one meekly toiling on in the midst of poverty and priva tions, with scarcely a hope of improving her condition ; the other surrounded by every advantage which the world most prizes. She was worthy of it, and more ; but was the other less so ! And were their fates reversed, how would Beatrice hear the stroke of adversity ? He had not solved this delicate problem when he arrived at his own door, and while he was still fumbling at the lock with his latch-key it struck him that even to propose such a question to himself was an act of dis loyalty, a sort of misprison of treason. Who could doubt that Beatrice, with her pride and firm reliance on self, would baffle and laugh to scorn every blow that adverse fate could aim at her !

Annie Wood and Beatrice Leycester flitted before him in confused alternation, but the only impression that remained on his memory was that he had put them both in harness and was driving them tandem fashion, when they contrived to capsize him into a quarry. Luckily he awoke before he reached the bot tom. What became of them he could not remember. He felt rather ashamed of himself when, on his walk down to the office, he called to mind all bis tergiversations of thought and feeling on the preceding evening, and, as a sort of expiation, he did what he had long wished, but had never mustered up courage to do \u2014 he wrote to Beatrice. He began his letter with a string of commonplaces, told ot his evenings passed at his sister's, his dinner with the Brentfords, and offered her what was intended to be a facetious condolence on Miss Hoodoodooana's initiation into the ways of the wicked ; but by degrees he slid into a b 5"], [18, "10 THE CARYLLS. more tender style, alluding to the hopes in which he had once ventured to indulge, the abject misery into which her rejection had plunged him, the dreary future which lay before him, etc., etc. Altogether it was a very touching epistle, but still it did not read as if it had run quite glibly off the pen ; there was something forced about it. Whether it struck Miss Leycester in this light or not, she did not keep him long wait ing for an answer ; it arrived by return of post, and ran thus : \u2014 \" My dear Mr. Caryll (for as you are in London I drop the Walter), for once I write to you, but it is to tell you that I never cor respond with gentlemen under sixty years of age, except to give them commissions, and at the present moment I have none to give.

Leycester.\" But then, as usual, came a postscript in tended to soften any disagreeable impressions which her first rigorous sentences might have produced. \" Dear Walter,\" it said \" you must not be angry, but for many reasons I think it better that we should not write to each other. You used to profess implicit obedience to my slightest wish. This is the test I impose on you. \" Yours affectionately, \"B.\" Time was, and that not so very long ago, when this letter would have thrown Walter into agonies of grief for having brought down such a reproof upon his head. Now he read it with a feeling of impatience and irritation, which even the anodyne contained in the post-"], [20, "12 THE CARYLLS. script was in the first instance incapable of allaying. It undoubtedly was a very curt and unsatisfactory answer to the six pages with which he had favoured Miss Leycester, and which it had cost him a world of trouble to compose. The quantity and quality of her answer were by turns the objects of his un favourable comments, but when he had vented his wrath in a few cutting ejaculations on Beatrice's hardness of heart and want of feel ing, he calmed down by degrees. He brought himself to acknowledge that he had justly ex posed himself to her rebukes by his infringe ment of the treaty existing between them, and he felt grateful for the kindness which had in duced her to apply a salve to the wound she had made. \" Yes,\" he soliloquised, \"she is a dear good honest girl, but no more capable of feeling or appreciating love than that chimney-piece. And yet,God knows, I would do anything in my power to serve her, as I am certain she would do for me. We shall always be friends, but I clearly see it is quite hopeless to look for more. As for my obedience, she may depend"], [21, "THE CARYLLS. 13 upon that, as far as letter- writing is concerned. I will expose myself to no more rebuffs like that. I only wish she had a commission to give me. Of course I should execute it to the best of my ability, and I should be delighted to have an opportunity of showing her that I. can write as concisely and as much to the purpose as she can.\" To calm the effervesence of his spirits he paid a visit to the Woods that evening, and was received by both mother and daughter with unaffected cordiality. If Beatrice Ley- cester's exactions had formerly given him pleasure, he derived at least equal gratifica- tion from the attentions of which he was now the object. Notwithstanding his resistance, he was installed in the most comfortable arm- chair in the room, while Annie insisted upon toasting his bread for him, kneeling before the fire at the risk of scorching her face, and injuring her eyes. Again, as he walked home, he investigated the various merits of Mesde moiselles Wood and Leycester, and this time the result was apparently in favour of the former. Beatrice was no doubt a charming"], [22, "14 THE CARYLLS. companion, a friend to be depended on in any emergency, but in a matrimonial sense there could be no question about Annie's supe riority. As he had no wish to appear indiscreet in his visits to Seymour place, he allowed some days to elapse before he attempted to renew them, but though absent in body he was pre sent there in mind during many hours of each day. At length he decided that he might again present himself there, without incurring any imputation of unreasonable haste. He was to dine that day with the Shorehams, but he could easily frame some excuse for mak ing an early retreat. In this expectation, however, he was disappointed. Mr. Shore ham had been detained at his chambers, and kept them waiting for dinner. It was past nine when they left the dining room, and for that evening his chance was gone. He would not run the risk of disturbing Mrs. Wood's quiet establishment at an undue hour. For a few minutes his discomposure was great as he saw the hands of the clock move round the dial with unrelenting regularity. He regained"], [23, "THE CARYLLS. 15 his usual cheerfulness, however, when he re flected that on the morrow he had no engage ment to stand in his way. But on the following day he fared still worse. Having settled in his own mind that seven would be a very proper hour for mak ing his appearance in Seymour Place, he took an early dinner at his lodgings, and then, sallying forth, crossed the park, and reached the place of his destination. To his enquiries if Mrs. Wood was at home, the girl who opened the door told him that Missis and Miss were both out ; gone to the Museum, she believed. He had forgotten in his im patience that this was one of the nights which Annie had told him were devoted to her studies. With a muttered imprecation on his bad luck, as he was pleased to term it, he threw away his cigar, jumped into a cab, and drove off to the Princess's, where he suc ceeded in calming his perturbed spirit. That the next evening should see him seated at Mrs. Wood's tea-table he was firmly resolved. Indeed, when he rose next morn ing, he was again on the point of strengthen-"], [24, "16 THE CARYLLS. ing his determination by a vow, when the maid knocked at the door, and handed him a note just arrived, and for an answer to which the servant was waiting downstairs. It was in Lady Mary Segrave's handwriting, and was dated the evening before. \" Dear Walter,\" she wrote, \"I arrived from Beatrice's an hour ago. Unless you have some very pressing engagement you must positively dine with me to-morrow. I so much wish to see you and have a little talk about various matters. Yours affectionately, M. Segrave.\" What could he do ! He could not refuse his kind friend, Lady Mary, who had always shown him so much liking, to whom he had devoted himself as long as it suited his pur pose ; besides, if the truth must be told, he was not a little curious to hear all that had been going on for the last month or six weeks at May Bank. He accepted, trying to per suade himself that he was the most unfortunate, the most to be pitied individual of the human race."], [25, "'IHE CARYLLS. 17 He showed no traces of this feeling, how ever, when he entered Lady Mary's drawing room. He responded with the utmost warmth to the unaffected pleasure she expressed at meeting him, and which had iu it something of the tenderness of an elder sister. She had asked no one to meet him, and during the dinner the conversation rolled entirely upon the most indifferent subjects, but when the servants had withdrawn Lady Mary said, \"You have not asked a word about your friend Beatrice.\" If he had not asked after her, he had cer tainly been thinking of her, and how he could introduce her name without showing too much interest, for the presence of her cousin, so inseparably connected with the rise and pro gress of his passion, had stirred up feelings which for the last few days had been things of the past, or had been treated by him as such. \"If I did not ask about Miss Leycester,\" he said, in reply to Lady Mary's observation, \" it is because she honoured me with a letter a few days ago, as you are probably aware. I hope you left her well.\" \" Now, my dear Walter, to use such lan-"], [26, "18 THE CARYLLS. guage in speaking of Beatrice to me is sheer affectation. Why speak of a friend as if she were a stranger, or, at the most, a common acquaintance ? \" \" If you saw her letter, Lady Mary, you must know that she imposed these terms upon me herself. She warned me that I was no longer Walter, and of course after that it would be a piece of impertinence in me to call her Beatrice.\" \" Ah, this is what, she feared ; that you should take it up in this way. I saw both your letter and hers, and after what had passed between you, and her explicit declaration, I must tell you candidly that you ought not to have written to her as you did, almost seem ing to imply that she might yet relent in your favour. It was not right, it was scarcely gentlen anlike. And yet, poor child, she was so afraid of having been too harsh, of having wounded you, that she added a few lines in a postcript, as if to deprecate your displeasure.\" \" Yes, yes, I was wrong ; I was a brute. I know it, I feel it now, but if she knew all, she would be gentler with me.\""], [27, "19 THE CARYLLS. \" My dear Walter, there is no want of gentleness in Beatrice's nature, though her language is sometimes abrupt, and may seem harsh. In the present case, she particularly charged me, if I found that you seemed hurt by any of her expressions, to do everything in my power to efface the impression. And I was not to forget to remind you that she fully expects you with the Brentfords at Easter.\" \" Surely,\" said Walter, \" if she objects to receiving an occasional letter from me, she cannot wish to have me as an inmate of her house.\" \" That is a totally different thing. You will go to May Bank as part of your sister's family, and while she is there no one could find fault with Beatrice's receiving you as a visitor.

Though from her love of independence she assumes con siderable latitude of action in things of minor"], [28, "20 THE CARYLLS. importance, on that very account she must be more than commonly circumspect in more serious matters. If I know you, nothing would grieve you more than that a breath of censure should be directed against her on your account.\" \" Ah, yes, in that, indeed, you do me no more than justice ; and when you write to her pray assure her that, whatever pain her deci sion gave me, I did not presume for a moment to find fault with it. I will never again do anything that can risk the loss of a friendship which I prize above everything else in the world. Ah, Lady Mary, why would she not give me a right to devote my life to her hap- piness.\" \" My dear Walter, in that she decided for herself, as every woman has a right to do. I do not believe that a marriage between you and Beatrice Leycester would conduce to the permanent happiness of either, and, what is more, I am convinced that some day or other you will think so, too. However, it is use less to discuss this further ; you must learn to look upon it as an event that can never, under"], [29, "21 THE CARYLLS. any circumstances, take place. You are a man in years ; show yourself a man in strength of mind, and forgive me if I have said anything that can grieve or annoy you. Believe me, in all I have said I have only had your good in view.\" \" Oh, of that I am quite sure. When have I ever experienced anything but kind ness from you ? I sometimes ask myself what first induced you to notice me.\" \"I am sure I cannot enlighten you,\" said Lady Mary, colouring slightly. \" Liking at first sight, I suppose; and I will do you the justice to say I have never had cause to repent it. But, to turn to other matters ; is it true, as Lord Isleworth tells me, that Captain Caryll is thinking of exchanging into a regi ment in India ?\" \" Quite true, and I expect every day to see him Gazetted.

CHAPTER II. His conversation with Lady Mary and all the old associations it had evoked produced a considerable change in the spirit of Walter's dreams that night. Beatrice was again re stored to her pride of place, and her image alone had the privilege of flitting round his pillow during his slumbers. It was with something like a feeling of satisfaction that he remembered on waking that a visit to Seymour Place that day would be a work of superero gation, seeing that Miss Annie would be oc cupied at the Museum. The following day was Sunday, and Mrs. Wood had told him that they went regularly to church in the evening \u2014 in fact, had given him to understand that on that day his visits could be dispensed with. Till Monday, therefore, a visit to the Woods was out of the question, and he must resign himself to his fate, which he contrived"], [33, "THE CARYLLS. 25 to do without much difficulty. He whiled away an hour or two at Lady Mary's, but without an opportunity of having any private conversation with her, as he had hoped and intended. The room was full of visitors, coming and going, and engrossing all their hostess's attention. It was with a slight amount of irritation that he took his leave. \" Good Heavens !\" he exclaimed to him self, as he left the house, \" what a life ! what society ! And to see Lady Mary, who has so much sense, and such a keen perception of the ridiculous, enter into it all as if it was her native element. It was enough to make a saint swear to see her listening with such apparent interest to all the twaddlers by whom she was surrounded. General Bonus, with his railway scrip and preference shares ; Lady Elizabeth Chignon, with her scarfs, and flounces, and latest fashions from Paris ; and then that infernal puppy, Alfred Thoresby, with his fresh bit of scandal, of which, by-the bye, I do not believe a word.

The life probably I should have to lead with Beatrice Leycester for a wife, for I remember last year Miss Beatrice seemed to take quite as much pleasure in it as her cousin. How different from Annie Wood, as I remember her at Lyn burn. Certainly, we had no lack of amuse ment there, without being driven to such resources as gossip and scandal. I don't re member a bore amongst us.'' And with this, a desire arose in his mind to talk over old Lynburn times with Miss Annie, and see if she recollected certain pas sages of their life there, on which he still dwelt with pleasure. Their conversation at their last meetings had been directed to other subjects, to more melancholy\" retrospects; but it would do them all good to look back to their happier hours. He was still in this frame of mind when he eat, as usual, his Sunday dinner at the Shoreham's ; and the sight of patriarchal bliss which there met his eye made a deeper impression than it had ever done before. Something of this he let"], [35, "THE CARYLLS. 27 fall to his sister, as he helped one of the younger ones on to a chair ; and she lost no time in preaching from her favourite text. \" Marry, Walter,\" she said, \" marry.

Of course you must marry someone with a little money ; enough to keep the wolf from the door ; but I know two or three very nice girls who would just suit you. I will give a party, and get them to meet you.\" But this was hurrying matters on a little too fast. Just at present, Walter said, he should have some difficulty in naming a vacant evening. \" There is the daughter of Judge Harebell, a great friend of ours, who would be the very person to suit you,\" persisted Lucy. \" She is a year or two older than you, which is always a good thing when a man marries young \u2014 it keeps him steady ; and she will have at least thirty thousand pounds.

Some people admire a squint \u2014 \" \" It is not true,\" burst in his wife, wdth considerable warmth. \" If she has one eye a little larger than the other, it is all that can be said. And as for her being five and thirty, she told me herself, when we dined there last week, that she was nine and twenty that very day.\" \" I suppose it is a very ungallant speech to make,\" said Shoreham, \" but in such a matter I had rather trust the parish register than any woman in England ; except you, my love.\" \" Then I would not,\" replied his wife."], [37, "29 THE CARYLLS. \" They are always so ill-natured, and make the worst of every thing.\" Her husband and brother could not help laughing at this declaration, and Lucy, after a little struggle, was compelled to join them.

But seriously, Walter, putting age and beauty on one side, it would be an excellent marriage for you in every way. She is clever and sensible, and I am sure she is good-tempered.

To say nothing of advertisements and rewards offered in the ' Times' for a run away husband, with instructions to apply at Mr. Pollaky's private enquiry office. Con sequently, as I have grave doubts as to the policy of marrying Miss Rosabella Harebell, and as the sage hath said, ' Dans le doute abstiens,' for the present I must decline your offers of assistance.\" \" Well,\" said his sister, \" I am very sorry for it, aud I only hope you will never repent it. But I must say it is very hard on me to have three brothers who will none of them marry, do or say what I will.\" Again, as he walked home that night, Walter's thoughts reverted to his nocturnal meeting with Annie Wood, and though he knew there was no museum open that night to tempt her forth, he half expected to fall in with her, and more than once turned round"], [41, "THE CARYLLS. 33 to see if any female form was following his steps. His conversation with his sister and her pertinacity in urging him to marry, had amused him at the time, and now he was disposed to admit that, though somewhat in discreet in dwelling so much upon the merits of her friend, Miss Harebell, her general arguments were not unworthy of attention. He was quite prepared to subscribe to her doctrine \u2014 that happiness is only to be found in the married state, and he dwelt with con siderable satisfaction upon the opinion she had expressed as to the propriety of a young man's marrying a woman somewhat older than himself. He thought, however, that she laid rather too much stress upon the necessity of the bride's being well endowed with temporal advantages. Of course, money is always agreeable, but the sufficiency or insufficiency of income depends entirely upon the previous habits and the natural disposi tions of the parties concerned. With such a girl as Annie Wood, for instance, a couple of hundreds a year would go as far as two c 5"], [42, "34 THE CARYLLS. thousand with Miss Leycester. He must see something more of the principles upon which Mrs. Wood managed her house. Of her poverty she made no secret, but it was decent poverty, with nothing to shock or offend the eye. Hitherto fortune had not befriended him in his attempts to revisit his old friends, but on the morrow, blow high or blow low, happen what might, he would drink tea in Seymour Place. In fact, it was a duty he owed to them and to himself. After all the professions of friendship he had made, what would they think of him if he delayed any longer to profit by the permission he had ob tained to come to them whenever he pleased ! Perhaps, already they classed him with those whose performance does not keep pace with their promise. Much comforted by this determination he went to bed, and slept the sleep of the just. He awoke in the same frame of mind, and began debating with himself what culinary offering he should take with him, for natur ally to sponge upon his old friend in her reduced circumstances was out of the ques-"], [43, "35 THE CARYLLS. tion. Half-a-dozen pounds of tea, with a couple of loaves of sugar, suggested them selves to his imagination, or perhaps a ham ; it was so unlucky the shooting season was over, or else a basket of game would have been the very thing ; but before the question was solved, the postman knocked at the door, and a letter from Captain Caryll was put into his hand. \" Dear Wat,' ' so wrote his brother, \" my exchange is effected, and will appear in the next ' Gazette.' I shall be in town nearly as soon as this letter, and as there are many subjects on which I wish to talk to you, I depend upon your giving me a quiet dinner in your lodgings. If you have any engage ment, try to get rid of it. We shall soon be so many thousand miles asunder, that I feel sure you will not disappoint me. \" Yours affectionately, \"E. C.\" There was nothing for it but to submit, and Walter did so without even a murmur at his bad luck. In 3 fact his mind was filled"], [44, "36 THE CARYLLS. with the thought of his brother's departure. Hitherto, while it was at a distance, he had hardly looked upon it as a reality ; he had spoken of it to Lady Mary Segrave with a sort of calm, philosophic indifference ; but now that all was settled, it gave him a bitter pang to think that, for the first time in his life, he was on the point of losing sor years the brother who had given him so many proofs of affection. It never entered into his head for a moment to refuse or evade Edward's request. The further consideration of the claims of Mrs. Wood and her daughter was adjourned sine die. At seven o'clock Captain Caryll made his appearance in Mount Street, chough evidently not in his usual spirits. The dinner passed off silently, for Walter was infected by his brother's depression ; but when they drew their chairs to the fire, and lighted their cigars, Edward thought it time to break silence. \" Well, old fellow,\" he said, with an at tempt at cheerfulness, \" to-morrow I shall be Major Caryll at your service. It has been a"], [45, "37 THE CARYLLS. long time coming, and I hope you are ready with your congratulations.\" \" I congratulate you most sincerely, dear Edward ; but I wish I could do so without grieving over your loss at the same time.\" \" Eh, que voulez vous ? We must take the suet with the plums ; but I confess I shall leave England with an anxious heart, if not a heavy one. I believe my father may live the next twenty years ; but still he is an old man. John gives me more uneasiness ; for, from what I hear, he is ill \u2014 very ill, and per sists in rejecting all advice. But my greatest anxiety is for Louisa.'' \" For Louisa ! How so ?\" \" She has accepted Mr. Leycester, and that is a marriage which none of her friends can approve.\" \"Approve! no, I should think not. But is it certain ? When did you hear it ?\" \"Quite certain. I had a letter from Caroline yesterday, and one from herself, to announce it. They are to be married in the course of the summer, as soon as Leycester takes possession of Tuftons.\""], [46, "38 THE CARYLLS. \" Is it positively settled? Cannot you, who have so much influence over her, do or say something to turn her from her purpose ? For she cannot love such a man as that, and she will be miserable before the year is out.\" \" My dear Wat, Louisa is not in love with him ; but she is determined to be Mrs. Ley cester, coute qui coute. In fact, she almost said as much in her letter to me. I did speak \u2022to her about him at the time of Maud's mar riage, and recollecting that, I suppose, she wrote to. me in such terms as to prove that all remonstrance would be useless. I have no doubt, in my own mind, that the marriage of her younger sister is at the bottom of it all. She is too affectionate and noble-hearted to feel jealous of Maud's prosperity ; but she does not like playing second fiddle to her.\" '\"Poor Louisa! poor dear Louisa! She little knows the fate she is preparing for heTself,\" said Walter. \" She, so generous, so high-spirited, to tie herself for life to that selfish brute. I never liked him, and now I hate him. His cousin Beatrice, I know, has the worst possible opinion of him.\""], [47, "39 THE CARYLLS. \" And well she may,\" Captain Caryll re plied. \" I know, from the best authority, that he moved heaven and earth to set aside the will of their uncle the Dean, who left all he had to leave to Beatrice. Luckily he was unsuccessful; but he accused her of using undue influence over a man in a state of im becility, and that was an imputation not easy to forgive.\" \" The d infernal villain ! \" exclaimed Walter. \" But how can she bear to speak to him?\" \" Well, when he found he was defeated, he threw all the onus on his lawyer, and ex pressed his deep repentance, and so forth. So by the advice of those she consulted, she let by-gones be by-gones, and in this I think she acted judiciously.\" \" Surely,\" said Walter, \" if you were to tell Louisa what you have just told me, she would have nothing more to say to him.\" \" In the first place, I could not tell her. It was confided to me as a secret, and if I have mentioned it to you, it is because I have full confidence in your discretion ; I have told"], [48, "40 THE CARYLLS. you secrets before now, and have never had occasion to repent it. In the next place, I am convinced it would not change Louisa's deter mination. She might not believe it, or if she did, as it happened some time ago, she might give him credit for his repentance, especially as she sees tbat Miss Leycester is on terms of civil intercourse with him. She would not think it necessary to rake up an offence which the offended party has forgiven and condoned, and, therefore, in my judgment, at least, the only effect would be to sow the seeds of dis trust between her and her husband to no pur pose. Certainly, during the short time that we were thrown into a certain degree of inti macy together, I saw nothing to object to in Leycester's conduct ; in his temper and dis position much. I believe him to be a cold, hard, selfish man, fond of money, and fond of rule. This it is that makes me so anxious, for Louisa likes to have her own way, too, and has had it. Though Caroline sits at the head of the table and looks over the housekeeper's accounts, Louisa is, in reality, the mistress of the house, a privilege freely accorded to her"], [49, "41 THE CARYLLS. by the affection of her father and sisters. Now she is embarking upon a career which will be one perpetual struggle for mastery, till her spirit is broken.\" \" Good Heavens, Edward, what a picture you have drawn ! Is there nothing to be done ? No remedy ?\" \" None, as far as I can see ; but I daresay I see everything in the gloomiest light just now. What hopes I have for her rest on the fact that they will pass the greatest part of the year at Tuftons. The near vicinity of Oakfield and the Holt will no doubt act, to a certain extent, as a check upon Mr. Leycester.\" \" Cold comfort, if that is all,\" said Walter. \"But, dear Edward, why do you take so gloomy a view just now ? Is it your ap proaching departure, or is there any other cause i \"None ; but is not that enough \u2014 to leave for so long all those I love, and the uncer tainty of ever seeing them again?\" \" But if those are your feelings, why go at all? Why not retire on half-pay, or leave the army altogether?\""], [50, "42 THE CARYLLS. \" Not for the world. I regret leaving you all, as is but natural ; but, on the other hand, I rejoice at having attained what has ao long been the object of my ambition. Have you yet to learn what a composite animal man is in his feelings ?\" \" In short,'' said Walter, \" you have quite made up your mind, and even if you regretted your decision, I suppose it would now be too late to alter it.\" \" Quite so, but I have not the slightest wish to retract. If it were to do again, having my father's permission, my choice would be the same. Le sort en est fete; je pars, cher Thera mtne.

When do you expect to sail ?\" \" 1 sail at the end of April ; I might re main a couple of mouths longer, if I went by Marseilles ; but the parting would come at last, and I want to pay Fanny and Marlowe a visit at the Cape.

To-morrow I must go to the Horse Guards, and a hundred other places, but I shall try to get through all I have to do ; and on the following day I hope to go down to the Holt. By-the-bye, I must not forget to tell you that I dine to-morrow at Lady Mary Segrave's, and she desired me to ask you, too. Lucy is coming to chaperon her, and Shore ham also if he can manage it.\" Walter reflected for a moment. It was Museum night, and he accepted. \"Have you seen Lady Mary, then?\" he asked. \" I called on her for a moment this after noon ; and, Walter, you will meet another guest ; Leycester dines there, too.\" \" Then I won't go.\" \" Yes, you will. He will be your brother in-law, and you must meet him as such. It must come sooner or later, and for Louisa's sake you ought to show him something like cordiality. To act otherwise would make her uncomfortable now, and might be of great detriment to her hereafter.

I fancy that, from the days of his boyhood, his father allowed him to do just what he pleased, and that, with such a nature as his, was ruin.

And that re minds me ; I was told that he had seduced, or jilted, or behaved ill in some way or other, to the daughter of your old tutor, Mr. Wood. Did you ever hear anything of it ?\" \"Seduce Ann \u2014 Miss Wood!\" exclaimed Walter, colouring violently, and with diffi culty suppressing his indignation. \" Cer tainly not. When I was at Lynburn Miss Wood was constantly invited to all the best houses in the neighbourhood, and was in the best county society. I should as soon suspect one of my own sisters.\" Captain Caryll looked at him curiously for a minute. \"Why, master Wat,\" he said, \" how vehe ment you are in Miss Wood's defence. I suspect you were a little smitten with her yourself.\" But Walter had recovered his composure."], [54, "46 THE CARYLLS. \"Without being smitten, of course I am vehement in her defence. I lived in their house for nearly two years, and, like my fellow-pupils, was always treated like one of the family.\" \"It was some bit of country gossip, I suppose,\" said Edward, looking at bis watch. \" And now I shall say good-night, for I am tired, aud have a long day's work before me to-morrow. We shaDmeet at dinner.\""], [55, "THE CARYLLS. 47 CHAPTER III. The dinner in Park Street passed off much better than Walter anticipated. In the course of the morning Lady Mary had fallen in with Sir Henry Savage, and, knowing his intimacy with Edward Caryll, had enlisted him as one of her guests. She had a sort of vague fear that the antipathy existing between Walter and John Leycester might break i out into some overt act, and thought that the presence of one who was a comparative stranger to both might act as a check upon them. But the precaution Was \"not needed. Leycester was evidently bent upon doing his best to cultivate the good graces of all present. Captain Caryll greeted him with real cor- diality, and Walter with apparent good-will, for he had pondered over and profited by his brother's lecture. The Shorehams were still warmer in their demonstrations. Lucy was"], [56, "48 THE CARYLLS. always well disposed towards anyone about to enter the pale of matrimony, and on the present occasion was naturally doubly prepossessed in favour of a future brother-in-law ; Shoreham lived too little in the world to know much about Mr. Leycester, except that he was a man of good family and good property, and was engaged to Louisa Caryll. The regard which he felt for all the members of his wife's family was reflected in a minor degree upon the man who was soon to form part of it. The conversation during dinner was of rather a desultory nature, but when the ser vants had left the room Sir Henry Savage said, \" Lady Mary, will you allow me to ask you and your other guests to join me in drink ing Major Caryll's good health.\" , \" Major Caryll ! \" she said, turning a little pale. \" Is your exchange then actually eflected?\" \" Yes, so I am given to understand. I believe you will see my name in the ' Gazette' to-morrow.\" \" Or to-night, if you hke it better, Lady Mary,\" said Sir Henry, drawing a \" London"], [57, "THE CARYLLS. 49 Gazette\" from his pocket. \" I sent down to the office for one this evening. Here it is : \u2014 \u25a0 30th Hussars. Captain Edward Caryll from the 4th Life Guards to be Major by purchase, vice Blake, who retires on half- pay.'\" The gentlemen warmly congratulated the new-made field-officer, on his promotion, an example followed by Lady Mary in less ener getic language, but Lucy was too honest to make a show of rejoicing for what was to her a subject of grief. \" My dear Edward,\" she said, \" I cannot pretend to be glad for what must take you from us all, but no one wishes more heartily or sincerely than I do that the step you have taken may conduce to your happiness.\" \" Thanks, dearest Lucy, and thanks to you all for your good wishes,\" said Edward. \" When I return I shall trespass so far on Lady Mary's good nature, as to ask her to give me a dinner to celebrate it with the same friends I now see around me.\" \"That I promise you,\" replied Lady Mary, VOL. II. d"], [58, "50 THE CARYLLS. cheerfully; \"with such additions to the present company as circumstances may make desir able.\" \" I hope I shall not seem presumptuous,\" said Leycester, \"if I take upon myself to thank you beforehand in the name of these promised additions. Sir Henry and Walter ought to join me.\" \" Of course we do,\" exclaimed Savage, \" but we also ought to know what time we have before us for acquiring these additions. You should name a day, Edward.\" \" I wish I could. I shall look forward to it impatiently enough, I promise you.\" \" Have you got through all your business, Edward?\" asked Walter. \" All. That is to say all that was ready for me. To-morrow I go down to the Holt, but only for a week. Then I return here for a fortnight, and the last few days of my stay in England I shall give up to my father.\" None of the party remained late. Mrs. Shoreham, of course, was in a fidget to get home, and their departure gave the signal for a general move. Lady Mary made no effort"], [59, "51 THE CARYLLS. to detain them ; she wished to commune with her own thoughts. \" This is not a visite d 'adieu, I hope,\" she said, as Major Caryll was taking leave of her. \" You will Lt me see you on your return to town?\" \" Without fail. I will not even say good bye now ; only good night.\" Leycester took a cab, and went to his club. The other three went to Walter's lodgings, where they whiled away a couple of hours talking over the past, and speculating on the future, enveloped in clouds of tobacco. At length Sir Henry and the Major took their departure, leaving Walter to his meditations. They were of a very chequered complexion, and it was long after Walter had laid his head on his pillow before he fell asleep. At length his perturbed thoughts found a resting place in Seymour-place. To-morrow he would again be a free agent. He had refused to dine at the Shorehams, and nothing should prevent his paying a visit to the Woods. His brother called on him to take leave D 2"], [60, "52 THE CARYLLS. while he was still at breakfast, and insisted upon his writing a letter, if not of congratu lation, at least of good wishes to Louisa on her approaching marriage, which he himself would take down and present. This was not a very congenial or easy task, but by Ed ward's assistance he composed a very credit able epistle, in which he gave full scope to his affection for his sister, with a slight com plimentary allusion to her intended. \" And when I am gone,\" said the Major, \" write to her occasionally. Never give her reason to suppose that by her marriage she has in any way forfeited the affection of her family. It may be that, some time or other, it will be her best support.\" \" Ah, Edward, when we lose you, she will lose, we shall all lose, our best support.\" \" Nonsense, Walter. I should not like to hear a woman, much less a man, talk of want ing support.\" They parted, and Walter went down to his office. That day it so happened that there was rather a press of work to be done, and it was six o'clock before he could get away."], [61, "53 THE CARYLLS. The mutton chop which he had ordered at his lodgings to be ready for him at five o'clock, sharp, would of course be done to a cinder; but little he recked of mutton chops. It was not that his appetite was impaired by any patriotic feeling, or the conscious satisfaction that he had been sacrificing his time to the good of his country ; on the contrary, for the last two hours he had been working himself up to a frenzy of impatience, and his only regret now was, that he must go home, if it were but for ten minutes, in order to ship the cargo of miscellaneous stores which lay stowed away in the closet of his bed-room. This was the more necessary as he felt really hungry, and the bread and butter on Mrs. Wood's tea table, though cut and prepared by her daughter, would scarcely be sufficient to satisfy the cravings of his appetite. He jumped into a Hansom, and Cabby, ex cited by the promise of double fare, carried him at racing speed to Mount Street, pursued by the vituperation of the women and the execrations of the men, whom he had narrowly escaped bringing to grief at every crossing."], [62, "54 THE CARYLLS. Telling the man to wait, he let himself in with his latch-key, and was rushing up stairs when the servant stopped him. \" Please, sir,\" she said, \" there is a gentle man upstairs waiting for you. He has been here the best part of two hours, and said he would wait till you came in.\" \" .\\ gentleman waiting for me ! What's his name ?\" \" He didn't give no name, sir. And please, sir, he said he was very hungry, and ordered me to bring up your chops, and go out for more.\" \" D his impudence ! What is he like? Did you ever see him before ?\" \" Please, sir, he is buttoned up in a great coat, and is quite unbeknown to me. And please, sir, he ordered me to fetch him a pint of stout, and didn't give me the money to pay for it.\" \" Money to pay for it ! I should think not. Why, depend upon it, you have let a burglar, or one of the swell mob, into my rooms, and I shall find every lock and drawer forced open ; but I will make short work with the"], [63, "55 THE CARYLLS. gentleman, as you call him, if he is still there, which is not likely.\" He dashed up-stairs three and four at a time. Throwing open the door of his sitting room, he saw the intruder, whose face he could not distinguish in the twilight, stooping down by the fire, and in the act of lighting one of the candles. \" Who the devil are you ?\" he began ; but he was cut short by a voice he knew, and John Caryll stood revealed. \" My dear Walter, how late you are ! They told me you would be back by five, and it is now half-past six.\" \"My dear John,\" replied Walter, some what impatiently, for he saw what was coming, \" I had not an idea that you were in town. When did you arrive ?\" \" Yesterday. And I want you to give up this evening to me, as I must return to-mor row; and I have business of importance to discuss with you.\" Walter hesitated. Was he never to see the Woods again ? \" I think,\" continued his brother, almost"], [64, "56 THE CARYLLS. beseechingly, \" you would not refuse, if you knew what brings me here to-night ; unless, indeed, you have some very pressing engage ment.\" Walter could not resist such an appeal. Slightly groaning in spirit, he replied \u2014 \" My dear John, I have no engagement that need stand in our way. I will give you some dinner. There is a capital cook's shop over the way, and when we have recruited our strength, you shall say your say at your leisure.\" \" Not for me, Walter. I dined capitally on your mutton chops.\" \" Nonsense ; that was luncheon. I must have some dinner, at all events, for I am famished ; and you must have some to keep me company.\" Saying which, he rang the bell with the energy of a starving man. He had not long to wait for Miss Sarah's appearance. After considerable hesitation, she had ventured up stairs on tiptoe, and was endeavouring to ascertain through the key-hole the result of the conflict between Walter Caryll and the"], [65, "57 THE CARYLLS. supposed burglar, when the sound of the bell struck upon her ear. Cautiously opening the door just enough to admit her head, she saw the object of their suspicions leaning back in an arm-chair, and his antagonist standing be fore him, apparently in an attitude of victory. \" Please, sir, shall I go for the purl ice ?\" she asked, in trembling accents, and without venturing into the room. \"The police !\" exclaimed Walter. Then recollecting what had passed between them on the stairs, he could not help laughing long and loud. \" No, no,\" he said, as soon as he recovered his breath, \" it is all right. Give this half-crown to the cabman, and tell him I shall not want him any more. Then run over the way, and tell them to send me a din ner for two as soon as possible.\" She departed on her errand ; and then in answer to his brother's enquiries, Walter had to explain why Sarah had suggested the in tervention of the police. \" The fact is,\" he said, \" the very few who come here at all, come so often, that she d 5"], [66, "58 THE CARYLLS. knows them all by sight and by name ; and I, on my side, should as soon have expected to receive a visit from the Pope as from you. I think it is the first time you have been in London since I have been established here ?\" \" It is. I never leave home if I can help it.\" Dinner made its appearance sooner than could have been reasonably expected. Walter, who was really hungry, did full justice to it, while his brother was hardly able to swallow more than a few mouthfuls. The cloth was removed, but John seemed in no hurry to make his promised communication. It can not be said that the conversation languished, but it turned exclusively upon domestic topics. \" And what do you say to Louisa's engage ment ? Of course you have heard of it,\" said John, when the other members of the Caryll familv had been passed in review. \" Yes, Edward told me of it. I need not say that she has my best wishes for her future happiness.\" Walter had no wish to make his brother a"], [67, "59 THE CARYLLS. confidant of his feelings towards his future brother-in-law. \" Of that,\" observed John, \" I see no rea son to doubt ; the little I saw of Mr. Leyces ter I liked much. Plenty of energy and decision, and in the right direction. He is a staunch friend of the Established Church ; he told me he allowed none of his labourers, or persons employed upon his property at Lyn burn, to attend a dissenting chapel. I only wish a few more of our great landed proprie tors were of the same stamp. It would be better for all classes of the population.\" \" Well,\" replied Walter, \" it always ap pears to me to be the height of tyranny to prevent people getting to Heaven their own way.\" \"Ay, but can they ? That is just the ques tion.

Walter, holding a glass of water to him. \"Quite as bad as the one you had in the winter.\" \" It is the same; I have never been able to shake it off. And this brings me to what I wished to say to you. We have seen but little of each other of late years, and I fear our intercourse while you were still a boy has not left any pleasing recollections on your mind. Still, we are brothers, sons of the same father and mother, and I think \u2014 I soel sure, that it will grieve you to hear that I am dying.\" \" Dying ! Good God, John, what is it you mean ?\" \" I do not mean to say that I am in imme diate danger of death ; but I am in a decline, and my life may now be measured by months \u2014 perhaps by weeks.\" \" Oh, my dear John, is there nothing \u2014 nothing to be done? Surely, with your youth there must be hope. Have you con sulted anyone?\" \" Yes. When I went to Oxford before Maud's marriage, it was to see a medical"], [69, "THE CARYLLS. 61 friend of mine, of very high standing in his profession, and he thought so ill of my case, that he wished me to come up to London for further advice. I was not able to manage this till yesterday. This morning I had a consultation of two of our most eminent men, and they condemn me. One lung is gone, and the other is seriously affected. I confess it gave me a shock at first to hear that there was no hope ; but, thank God, I am recon ciled to it now. I have no fear of death.\" For a short space Walter was silent. If he had not loved John with the affection which he felt for Edward and his sisters, now that he was on the point of losing him, the voice of blood made itself heard all the more power fully, that it had been so long repressed. Every angry feeling he had cherished, every bitter word he had uttered against his brother rose up in judgment against him. He longed to throw himself into his arms and entreat his forgiveness. It was in a very unsteady voice that he again spoke. \" But why not try a milder climate ?\" he said. \" Madeira or the south of France ? I"], [70, "62 THE CARYLLS. have heard of almost miraculous cures from a change of air, and at your age, I cannot be heve your case to be hopeless.\" \" My dear Walter, age has nothing to do with consumption, or rather it is generally the young who are attacked by it. With re gard to a milder climate, I did suggest it, but I was given to understand that though it might prolong life for a short time, it could not effect a cure.\" \" But try it, John ; at least, give it a chance. It is almost your duty to do so.\" \" No. I have considered the question in all its bearings, and have made up my mind to remain in England, where I have real duties to perform as long as strength is vouchsafed me. Besides, I will confess my weakness. I cannot bear the idea of dying in a foreign land far from home, without one friendly or familiar face near me.\" \" Oh, if that is your only objection, I will go with you and stay with you as long as you may think it expedient to remain.\" \" God bless you, dear Walter, for your kindness,\" said John, taking his hand ; \" but"], [71, "THE CARYLLS. 63 it cannot be. In the first place it would in volve the sacrifice of your profession, and that I would not hear of. In the next place, there are others I should not like to leave. No, I must die at the Holt, and be laid in the old vault, where so many of our race have been laid before me.\" \"Are any of them aware of your danger?\" asked Walter, with the tears running down his face. His heart was yearning to the brother whom he had almost looked upon as a foe, but whose present state excited his deepest sympathy. \" Not yet, with the exception of Shoreham, whom I was obliged to take into my confi dence, as I will explain to you by-and-byre. I shall tell Edward, when I return to-morrow, and take his advice as to breaking it to them, for I know they will be sorry for me, though I hardly have a right to expect it from them.

It was a duty imposed upon me by my holy office, and that I might be the better able to perform it efficiently, ever since I was set apart for the priesthood, I have wrestled against all worldly attach ments. Perhaps I carried this feeling too far; at all events, the effort was made in vain, for now I cling to every recollection of home, and sigh for the family affections which I have forfeited.\" \" No, no, John, in that you are mistaken ; at least, I can speak for myself, and 1 think I can speak for the others. No doubt your apparent want of sympathy checked all ex- pression of love and confidence on our part, but, though dormant, believe me, they still exist. Edward has always done you justice, and has more than once reproved me for judging you too harshly. I feel novv how right he was, and entreat your forgiveness.\" \" Ah, Walter, if you can speak of asking my forgiveness, I shall not despair of obtain ing yours ; for whatever you may have said of me, I have no doubt I deserved it all, and"], [73, "65 THE CARYLLS. more. When I look back to the days of your boyhood, I shudder to think what a tyrant I was; how you must have hated me; and then I had no imperious sense of duty to plead as an excuse; but Walter, I was jealous.\" \"Jealous! Of whom, of what?\" \" I hardly know. Of everybody and every thing, I believe. I thought you all more loved, more favoured than me, and you being the weakest, to my shame be it said, it was on you I vented my anger.\" \" Well,\" saidW alter, \"that is all past, nearly forgotten, and certainly quite forgiven, so never let us recur to it. And depend upon it, now that we know your real feelings, we shall all vie with each other in proving to our brother how dearly we love him.\" John Caryll remained silent for some time, shading his face with his hands. At length he said, \" Thank you, Walter. You have done me more good than all the faculty could have effected. You have taken a great weight off my mind, and made me feel more at peace with myself.

At Dr. Cox's death there will be no one to succeed him, unless you will take my place, and this is what I have to pro pose to you.\" \" Take your place ! succeed Dr. Cox ! Why even if there were no other objection, you forget that I am not in orders, and even if I were, that I am not old enough to hold the living.\" \" No, I forget neither. But you can go at once to Oxford or Cambridge, and take your degree, by which time you will be of age to be ordained. If in the meantime the living were to fall in, it could be held for you till you are ready7 for it. It is a thing done every day.\" \" My dear John, I like my own profession, and I have not the slightest vocation for the Church.\" \" If you really have conscientious scruples, I should be the last man in the world to try to argue you out of them. Still you must let me put the whole case before you. And first,"], [75, "THE CARYLLS. 67 as regards vocation ; how few there are of our clergy who, when they take orders, have what may be called a real vocation. Of course there ought to be no positive repugnance, but I speak within bounds when I say that nine tenths of the clergy enter the Church solely as a profession by which they are to gain their livelihood ; and yet how many excellent labourers there are in the vineyard, how few who bring a scandal on their cloth ! And of one thing I feel quite certain ; whatever duties you may undertake, you will execute them conscientiously and to the best of your abi lity.\" \" I should try, no doubt,\" Walter replied, lt but if my heart was not in my work, I am afraid it would be very negligently executed.\" \" And,\" continued John, \" in a worldly point of view the advantages are great. Fifteen hundred a year, a good house, the near proximity of the Holt, Oakfield, Tuftons ; in short, you would be in the midst of all those you love, and surrounded by neighbours who have known you since your birth. To these arguments,\" he added, with a faint smile,"], [76, "68 THE CARYLLS. \" Lucy, no doubt, would join the temptation of being able to marry and bring up a numer ous family, which in your present career you could not hope to do for many a long year.\" Notwithstanding all these inducements, Walter still seemed inclined to turn a deaf ear to his brother's proposal. Perhaps he recol lected Miss Leycester's denunciation of clerical marriages, and had no wish to risk the alter native of a life of celibacy, or incurring the imputation of not being the real thing in her eyes. At length he said \u2014 \" And what will become of the living, sup posing we neither of us take it ? My father has no nephew, or even son-in-law, to whom he could offer it.\" \" Ah, that brings me to the point on which I wished to consult Shoreham. He is clearly of opinion that, by the terms of our grand father's will, in case all the yrounger sons refuse to take it, the next presentation to the living must be sold, and the proceeds divided between them. This is what must be done if you refuse, in which case, should the sale take place during my life, I shall think it an act of"], [77, "THE CARYLLS. 69 simple justice to make over my share to you at my death. I am told that, considering Dr. Cox's advanced age and infirmities, we ought to get at least ten year's purchase for it, but for that very reason you ought to be quick in your decision.\" \" But,\" said Walter, \" that will be exposing my father, and Edward after him, to have some disagreeable, vulgar brute thrust upon them as a near neighbour.\" \" I hope not. There is a young clergyman who was my intimate friend at college, and one of the very few with whom I have kept up any intercourse since I left it, who, I think, would be glad to buy it. He is a gentleman in education, manners and feeling, in everything, in short, except in birth. His father is a rich manufacturer, who rose from the ranks, and thinks that the Church is the readiest way of raising his son in the social scale.\" \" Well, John, I will think it over, though I tell you candidly, my present impression is that my decision will be to remain as I am. But my head is in such a whirl that at the"], [78, "70 THE CARYLLS. present moment I can turn my thoughts to nothing but the first sad tidings. I cannot yet realise them. It seems like having just found a brother, only to lose him again directly. And that you should be the first to go from among us ! When I recollect what you were two short years ago, it seems impos sible. Which of us will be the next?\" \" It is not ouly possible,\" John replied, \"but inevitable, aud you must learn to recon cile yourself to it, as I have done. And now, I shall say good-night. Have you any messages for the Holt ?\" \" None. My love, of course.\" \" And let me know what you decide upon as soon as you can ; while Edward is still with us, if possible. And, dear Walter, one request before I go. You will be with me when my hour is come. I should like to see you all round my bed.\" \" Ah, can you doubt it ? I will come at the first summons. I little thought, when I first saw you to-night, that I should have to make such a promise as that.\""], [79, "THE CARYLLS. 71 CHAPTER IV. If Walter Caryll's ideas were in a state of confusion when he went to bed, they were not much clearer when he awoke. His brother's painful revelations filled his mind with the most melancholy reflections. With the exception of his mother's death\u2014 which had occurred when he was still too young fully to appreciate such a loss \u2014 fate had dealt gently with the Caryll family ; but now that it had begun its aggressions, who could say where they would stop ? And then came an intense feeling of pity for their first victim, accompanied by something not unlike re morse. Had he been asked a few days before which member of the family could best be Bpared, undoubtedly he would have named John. Now, it seemed to him as if the one they were about to lose, the brother who was so anxious to atone for past coldness and in-"], [80, "72 THE CARYLLS. difference, was he whose loss would be most severely felt. He was so occupied with these thoughts, that it was some time before he could direct his attention to the consequences following John's death. They were of too much importance to be hastily considered and decided on, involving, as they probably would, the entire disposition of his future career. The certainty of acquiring at no distant period a large and permanent income, joined to the other advantages which had been pointed out to him, was, no doubt, a great temptation. Still, it was far from being without alloy. The life of a country clergyman held out but few charms to one who was not particularly rural in his tastes, and who, without plunging into any of the excesses of dissipation, had, for two years, enjoyed and appreciated the varied pleasures of a London life. He liked his profession, he liked his companions, with whom he lived upon terms of good-fellowship, and he particularly liked the society of those friends whom he had made in the course of his short career, and which he would be com pelled, in a great measure, to relinquish, if"], [81, "THE CARYLLS. 73 once condemned to the monotonous solitude of a parsonage. No one felt more keenly than himself that he belonged to a gregarious race, delighting in the busy hum of men. And even the money part of the question pre sented itself under two different aspects. The price to be obtained for the next presentation would more than place him at his ease, and though the income to be derived from it would not, in all probability, amount to half of that derived from the living itself, yet the latter would be his for life only, while in the other case the principal would be his to deal with as he pleased, and, should he marry, would form a provision for those he might leave behind him. Moreover, he was conscientious, not outrageously so, but, still, more so than most men of his age. He not only doubted his own qualifications for discharging his ministerial duties, but he called to mincl Edward's remarks on undertaking them with out a thorough conviction of being able to go through with them ; and he had a great aud well-founded respect for Edward's opinion. VOL. II. E"], [82, "74 THE CARYLLS. He would have given much to be able to talk the matter over with him ; but it was out of the question to attempt to discuss such a sub ject as that in a letter. Still, he was reluctant to come to a positive decision upon it without consulting some one, and he selected Mr. Shoreham as his adviser. In this there could be uo impropriety, as John had already taken him into his confidence. To Mr. Shoreham's chambers accordingly he sped as soon as he was at liberty, and was fortunate enough to find him alone, and pre paring to return to Kensington. However, he was in uo hurry, and when Walter asked him if he could give him ten minutes or a quarter of an hour of his time, he assented, as a matter of course. Walter detailed to him all his objections, doubts, and scruples, while he adverted fairly enough to the advantages of the proposed arrangement, to all of which Shoreham listened with great attention, without inter rupting him. When he had concluded, Shoreham replied \u2014 \" As regards your scruples of conscience I"], [83, "75 THE CARYLLS. have nothing to say. On that head I am not competent to offer advice; in fact, they must be resolved by your own feelings. Therefore, we will go at once to your more material interests. And in the first place, it is quite clear to me that your inclinations are opposed to poor John's proposal. This of itself is of great weight with me. The advantages offered are fifteen hundred with a house ; say sixteen hundred a year in all. On the other hand, you will receive from twelve to fifteen thousand pounds from the sale of the living, for which on good security you ought to get five per cent ; say six hundred and fifty pounds a year. Then you have your pro fession with an increasing salary, which I suppose by the time you are thirty will go a long way to make up the deficiency. If you marry, which Lucy would look upon as a certainty, and which even I admit to be probable, you will be in the enjoyment of your full income with something to leave to your children. But as a clergyman, with only a life interest, you must either save, or insure E 2"], [84, "76 THE CARYLLS. your life, or leave your children beggars, and to serve them effectually would clip your wings not a little. It would hardly be less than five hundred a year to be deducted from your revenue. Then, if the living is sold, you come at once into possession of the proceeds, whereas on the other hand, men as old and as infirm as Dr. Cox sometimes live for years. If, on the contrary, he were to die before you are ordained, as is not unlikely, you must get some one to hold it for you till you are, and occasionally a locum tenens has refused to resign when called upon. Lastly, you have been leading rather an idle life for the last two years, and in two years men sometimes contrive to forget more than they have learnt in ten. Suppose you go to college, and are plucked \u2014 such things have been. Where would you be then? You would lose your chance of the living, and you could not re sume your place at the Foreign Office.

Had I thought your own wishes tended to acceptance, I should have contented myself with pointing out the pros and the cons, without offering an opinion.\" \" Thank you, my dear Shoreham. I will think over all you have said, but your opinion entirely coincides with mine, and I have no doubt I shall follow it.\" \" Follow your own judgment,\" said Shore ham. \" And as no counsel learned in the law ever gives, or at least ought to give, an opinion without a fee, the one I exact is that you jump into a cab with me, and come home to dinner. I told poor Lucy about John, and naturally she is very low about him, though I had warned her of what we might expect. I thought, as far back as Christmas, he was not long for this world. But let us be off now; the sight of you will do her good-\" Walter accepted at once. It was with a sort of satisfaction that he reflected that it was a closed day as far as regarded Seymour Place. Much as he wished to see the Woods"], [86, "78 THE CARYLLS. again, he felt that it was only amongst the members of his own family that he could feel at ease, for that night at least, with this heavy affliction hanging over them. Shoreham had not exaggerated his wife's depression. She was rather apt to take a gloomy view of things at the best of times, and as she kissed her brother, with the tears streaming from her eyes, she said, \" Dear Walter, this is kind indeed. Let us cling to each other, while any of us are still left.\" \" It does not require poor John's illness for that,\" Walter replied. \" But I trust we have many long years before us all to cling together, for we are a long-lived race, and your own children are the pictures of health. Remem ber, he is not the victim of hereditary disease, but of his own courageous humanity. If we are to lose him, we ought to feel as proud of him as if he had fallen in battle in the moment of victory. More so, indeed, for the conqueror sows tears, and John wiped them.\" \" It is quite true. But still I cannot help thinking that there must have been great"], [87, "79 THE CARYLLS. constitutional weakness, for a mere wetting to have taken such hold of him. Poor little Hilda has got a cold which I do not at all like.\" \" My dear Lucy,\" said her husband, \" Hilda has got a cold in her head, as she has often had before, and as, no doubt, she will often have again. The only risk she runs is that of having her nose wrung off her face by your incessant wiping.\" \" Ah, colds in the head often lead to some thing much worse.\" \" Not at all. I have had a cold in my head these five-and-twenty years, and it has never done me any harm, that I know of.\" \" And you never told me of it !\" she said, reproachfully. \" Why should I ? I can blow my nose for myself, thank goodness.'' After dinner Mrs. Shoreham opened upon a new tack. \" Poor John\u2014 poor dear John ! how he must now feel the want of a wife to nurse him, and watch over him. How he must now regret not having taken my advice and married in time.\""], [88, "80 THE CARYLLS. \" If I were in John's place,\" said Shore ham, \" I should rejoice to think that I left behind me no poor, young, desolate widow, with two or three children perhaps, totally unprovided for. That indeed would be a terrible aggravation of his sufferings.\" \" Yes, indeed. Poor young thing, I am sure I should feel for her.\" \"Fortunately she does not exist.\" \" And about the living, Walter? Poor John ! I had always looked forward to his officiating at Gualdrada's marriage, and now it will fall to your lot, if indeed one can venture to look forward to any thing in this world.\" \" You must not look forward to that, I am afraid,\" said Walter. And then he went into all his objections to giving up his present prospects and entering upon such a different career, for which he felt himself totally un fitted. Nor did he fail to strengthen his arguments by quoting Shoreham's observa tions and opinion.

By the sale of the living he will be in a posi tion to marry whenever he pleases, with something to settle on his wife.\" This was placing matters in another and more pleasing light, and went far to reconcile her to her brother's plan. \"And you promise me, Walter,\" she said, \" to lose no time in set tling down into a respectable married man.\" \" I promise you to look about me in the hopes of finding some one worthy of me. Indeed I have been occupied with this in vestigation for the last two years.\" \" I know a charming girl, no, not Rosabella Harebell,\" she hastenedto add, when she saw a smile on her brother's lips. \" I am glad of that, at all events,\" he re plied ; \" but I know dozens of charming girls, only unluckily they do not charm me.\" \" Well,\" she said, \" as long as you have a wish to marry I am satisfied. Your time will come.

Oh, how I wish little Ned was old enough to hold it.\" \" Ned has some sixteen years to wait be sore he can hold that or any other living,\" said Mr. Shoreham ; \" and most assuredly he could never hold this, which is the pro perty of your brothers, unless I bought it sor him, which I am hardly prepared to do at present.'' \" When are you to give poor John your answer?\" asked Mr. Shoreham. \" There is no time fixed. My mind is all but made up, but I shall take to-morrow for further reflection, and T shall write to him the day after.\" The conversation on that subject dropped, and lapsed into other domestic channels. Edward's departure, Louisa's marriage, the expected return of the Brentfords, were all"], [91, "83 THE CARYLLS. discussed in turn, and it was at a later hour than usual that Walter took his departure from Kensington. The delay of a day before coming to a final decision was not so much caused by Walter's desire for further reflection, as by a wish to hear what Mrs. Wood had to say ot the advantages and disadvantages attending the clerical profession. No one had had better opportunities of appreciating them, and though he had not the slightest intention ot allowing his judgment to be influenced by anything she might say, it would be the height of folly not to obtain all the lights he could on so momentous a subject. It is true he had not quite so exalted an opinion of Mrs. Wood's good sense as he had of her good nature, but no doubt her observations would elicit some valuable notes and com ments from her daughter. At all events, it was worth trying, and as nothing could by any possibility occur to prevent his calling on them on the following evening, he had no scruple in deferring the promulgation of his decision for another twenty-four hours. He"], [92, "84 THE CARYLLS. spent an hour or two before he fell asleep in constructing the various phrases, by which he should introduce the subject to his friends in Seymour Place and obtain their opinion, without seeming to ask for it. He rose late, and was again seated at his breakfast table ; but, if he expected to enjoy that meal in peace, he was speedily unde ceived. A slight tap at the door, and enter the maid. \" Please, sir, there's a gentleman and lady as won't give their names, and wishes to see you. Walter was in a genteel dishabille, quite good enough for any of his male friends, but hardly fit for the reception of a lady of high degree. However, he thought that he need not stand upon any great degree of ceremony wdth persons who thought fit to take him by storm at that ungodly hour, and gave orders for their admittance. But before the words were out of his mouth, Lord and Lady Brent ford stood before him. \" There, Maud,\" said his lordship, \" per haps you will believe me another time. How"], [93, "85 THE CARYLLS. are you, old fellow ? I told her we should find you just out of bed, half dressed, and beginning your breakfast, and she would not believe me.

I shall be wiser in future.\" After this attack, the conversation was directed to all that had happened since they last met. Maud and her husband were evi dently ignorant of everything relating to John Caryll's illness, and Walter determined to say nothing of it till he had an opportunity of speaking to Lord Brentford in private. At length his visitors rose to depart. \" By-the-bye, Wat,\" said his brother-in law, \"you dine with us to-day, of course, and will accompany us to the Adelphi after wards.\""], [94, "86 THE CARYLLS. \" Nothing would give me greater pleasure, but a previous engagement, I am sorry to sav-\" \" Oh bosh !

She seems to have a pas sion for making herself uncomfortable about nothing,\" observed Lord Brentford. \" Lucky for all of them that her husband takes things so philosophically.\" Lady Brentford was already half way down stairs. \" I want to speak to you, Brentford,\" said Walter, \" Can you come to Downing Street any time before five?\" \" I will try,\" said his lordship, rushing down stairs.

His own impression was that Walter had got into some money scrape, and wanted his assistance. Consequently his first speech on their meeting was, \" Well, old fellow, how much is it? I have brought my cheque book with me.\" \" What on earth do you mean ?\" asked Walter, rather astounded. \" I mean that I am come to help you out of your scrape, if you are hard up. I do not suppose you would separate man and wife for anything less important.\" \" Many, many thanks ; as many as if I re quired your assistance, which I am happy to say I do not. No ; it is something of much greater importance to us all.\" He then re lated to him the particulars of his interview with John, and his conversation with Shore ham. \" Poor fellow !\" exclaimed Lord Brentford ; \" I am very sorry for him, though, compara - tively speaking, I know but little of him.

He then sat down to the table and wrote to Mrs. Wood, explaining to her that his eldest brother's approaching departure for India, the dangerous illness of his second brother, John, and the unexpected arrival of the Brentfords from Paris, had so completely engrossed his time, that he had literally not had one moment to give his other friends. In a few days he should again be free, when he would not lose a moment in presenting bis respects in person to Mrs. and Miss Wood, concluding with re questing her acceptance of certain delicate viands, hams, tongues, &c., which, by a most audacious fiction, he represented as having been the property of Major Caryll, and trans ferred to him by that gallant gentleman, but for which he himself had no use whatever. Having indited this epistle, he proceeded to write to John Caryll. Deprived as he was of Mrs. and Miss Wood's counsels, he was com pelled to depend entirely upon his own judg ment and Shoreham's advice, and further hesitation was useless.

He still felt a warm and affection ate interest for his lost love ; he set the highest value on her friendship and regard, but it was no longer that absorbing passion which he had once fancied it to be.

In vain he repeated to himself that after her rejection of him it must be what she must expect, the very thing she must most wish for. He feared that after two short months to be convicted of such inconstancy would lower him in her estimation, and this was a thought he could not bear. He must endeavour to keep up the delusion, and throw dust in her eyes by acting a part for which no man was less qualified. From this necessity he was fortunately saved. The Brentfords, Lady Mary, and Walter went down together, and the first per son they saw waiting for them at the station was Miss Leycester; the second, I dward Caryll, whom she had pressed to pass a couple of days with her to meet his sister, before returning to town. They had not half a mile to walk, and no carriage was needed. Beatrice greeted all her guests with the same frank, open-hearted cordiality. There was no embarrassment of manner when she shook hands with Walter,"], [105, "THE CARYLLS. 97 and thanked him for coming to visit her in her cottage, and he at once felt a sensation of unexpected relief. She even shook hands warmly with Lord Brentford before she recol lected herself. \" Well, as it is done let it stand,\" she said, \" but confess you do not deserve it. I was very near making a vow that I would never forgive your conduct to my poor monkey, but I thought of Maud and relented.\" \" Pity Lucy cannot hear you,\" said Walter ; \" she would insist upon the necessity of all men of vicious habits like Brentford having wives to mediate for them in time of need.\" \" And, Mary,\" continued Miss Leycester, \" you have no idea how anxiously I have been expecting you and Maud. Major Caryll has been here these two hours, and I have not had a soul to protect me, for poor Brownie is no use ; I am obliged to chaperon her, instead of her chaperoning me. Now I put myself entirely under your matronly safeguard.\" After dinner, when the three gentlemen VOL. II. p"], [106, "98 THE CARYLLS. were left to themselves, the conversation naturally fell upon John Caryll. \" I was the first to whom he announced it,\" said Edward, \" and though greatly shocked, I was not quite unprepared, for I have thought him in very delicate health for some time. He begged me to break it to my father and sisters, and I confess I was sur prised at the effect it produced upon them. That the hopeless state of a son and brother should produce a most painful impression was but natural, but, considering how much John's eccentricities have kept him aloof from us, I did not expect the real, deep grief which his approaching fate occasioned. They feel it, and I may say I feel it too, as a link severed from the chain which bound us all together. My father in particular, was, I think, more affected than any of us; almost as much so as when he lost my mother. It is true, that for her death he had been long prepared, and this was an unexpected shock. I suspect too that, somehow or other, he has coupled it in his own mind with rny going to India. It is"], [107, "99 THE CARYLLS. hard for an old man to be reduced from three sons to one.\" \" From four to two, if you please,\" said Lord Brentford. \" Of course I do not expect him to feel for me the affection he feels for you, but I will do my best to assist Walter in replacing you during your absence.\" \" Thank you, dear Brentford,\" Edward replied, taking his hand, \" I feel sure of it, and you do not know what a relief to me it is to know that he will have you and Maud so near him. Walter, I know, will do all he can\u00bb but he must necessarily be absent during the greatest part of the year, while you will be, I conclude, during half of it at least, on the spot.\" \" I was thinking of taking Maud to Italy this winter, but this of course, will make a change in our plans, for we shall be in no humour for gaiety, or even for sight-seeing ; unless indeed it would be of use to John, whom we should be delighted to take with us. I will write to-morrow to propose it to him, for very possibly his case is not as hopeless as he fancies.\" F 2"], [108, "100 THE CARYLLS. \" Of that,\" said Edward, \" I grieve to say there can be no doubt. From what he told me, I do not think he can reach the autumn, nor does he expect it himself; but he is quite prepared ; I never saw, or heard of more unaffected resignation. Nevertheless, write to him. He will not accept, but, as a proof of your friendship and sympathy, it will do him good. Poor fellow ! he feels so deeply every mark of interest that is given him. He is completely changed ; it is almost painful to witness his anxious, humble craving for affec tion, as if he felt that it was a boon which he had no right to claim.\" \" John is better than me,\" said Walter, with tears in his eyes. \" I feel now how unjust I was to him. Would to God it was not too late to repair it ! \" \" Yes,\" replied his brother, \" yrou went too far, as I told you more than once ; but we must admit that John of to-day is a very different person from John of a few years back. And now I want to mention another subject. I have made my father promise that at the very first indication of failing health"], [109, "101 THE CARYLLS. he will warn me, that I may return at once ; but I do not quite trust him. He will be saying, ' Oh, it's time enough when I am really ill,' and put it off perhaps till it is too late. Now I depend upon you two for letting me know the exact truth ; and should there be any signs of illness, Walter must telegraph for me. I should never forgive myself if I were absent during his last moments.\" They both gave the required assurance. \" And about. Maud ?\" said his lordship. \" I think I had better tell her about John to night, when we are alone.\" \" Decidedly,\" replied Edward. \" It will grieve her deeply, but she will cry herself to sleep, and be calmer in the morning. Take her upstairs early, to give me an opportunity of mentioning it to Lady Mary and Miss Leycester to-night. \"And Louisa; when is she to be married?\" asked Walter.\" \" As soon as they can get everything ready. John has set his heart upon marrying her, but there is much to be done. Mr. Leycester is painting Tuftons inside and out,"], [110, "102 THE CARYLLS. and means to refurnish it entirely. I should not be surprised if he ended by buying it ; he seems to like it so much, and as it must be sold at Mr. Birch's death, I suppose he would have no difficulty in buying it now. He is there morning, noon, and night. He is the most energetic man I ever met with.\" \" The Leycesters are all energetic,\" ob served Lord Brentford, \"and I suspect if we sit here much longer, Bee will show her energy by giving us a good scolding.\" When they entered the drawing room, they found Maud sitting for her portrait in crayons to Lady Mary Segrave, who, without being an artist, had a very happy knack of taking likenesses. Miss Browne and Beatrice were looking over her, notwithstanding her re monstrances, and Maud was jumping up every moment to see how matters were progressing. \" Oh, Edward,\" said Lady Brentford, \"you must positively prevail on Mary to take your likeness for me before you go.\" \" You dispose of Lady Mary's time and good nature very much at your ease,\" her brother replied."], [111, "103 THE CARYLLS. \" They are both at her service,\" said Lady Mary, \" and if you have no objection to give me a sitting to-morrow, I will see what I can do.\" \" I shall be most happy, but I fear there will be hardly time. I must return to town on Wednesday with Walter.\" \" A couple of hours will be sufficient for a sketch. If I can catch your likeness at all, it will be du premier coup, and I can finish it at my leisure.\" \" By this time Lord Brentford began to look about him, and spied Miss Hoodoodooana demurely seated on the top of a peieh, exa mining her toes with great curiosity. \"Oh, my angel, my love, idol of my heart's best affeGtions,\" he exclaimed, going toward her ; \" do I see you once more !'' But the yonng lady appeared insensible to the voice of the charmer. She chattered, and showed her teeth, and made unmistakable signs of the most determined aversion. \" Now, Brentford,\" said Beatrice, \" you positively shall not tease Mrs. Howe.\" \" Who on earth is Mrs. Howe ?\""], [112, "104 THE CARYLLS. \" Oh, the other name was too long ; Brownie said it made her teeth ache every time she had to pronounce it.\" \" But why Mrs. ? Has she been commit ting matrimony in my absence ?\" \" Ask Brownie ; she will tell you all about it.\" \" Miss Browne,\" said his lordship. \" Will you have compassion on a miserable, despair ing lover, and tell me who has robbed me of my love ?\" Miss Browne blushed, and cast a reproachful look on her friend. \" Why, my lord,\" she began, \" Miss Ley cester thought \u2014 \" \" Novv, Brownie, that's a fib,\" interrupted Beatrice. \" I never thought of it at all till you put it into my head. But, if you must know, Brownie thought that, as she had had a baby, she must have been married, and that it was the height of impropriety to address her as if she were still in single blessedness, like us.\" \" And some clay or other Mr. Howe will be coming and carrying her off! \" said his lord-"], [113, "105 THE CARYLLS. ship. \" But, before that fatal day arrives, I will see if I cannot establish an interest in her heart, which nothing shall ever be able to erase.\" He rang the bell. \" Will you have the goodness,\" he con tinued, when the servant appeared, \" to ask Lady Brentford's maid for Miss Hoodoodoo ana's carton, and bring it me here ?\" The servant departed with a broad grin on his face, and speedily reappeared with a large band-box, which he delivered to Lord Brentford. \" Now, Mrs. Howe,\" said his lordship, pro ceeding to open it, \" you shall see what you shall see.\" And with infinite care and cir cumspection, he brought to light a complete miniature ball-dress, made of the most expen sive materials, and in the newest Parisian fashion. The ladies had congregated round the table on which the various articles were displayed, and loud were the exclamations of admiration. Beatrice was in a state of ecstacy. p 5"], [114, "106 THE CARYLLS. \" I never saw anything half so beautiful !\" she exclaimed, delicately handling the gown trimmed with real point-lace. \" You ought to be well scolded for your absurd extrava gance. Maud had nothing half so handsome in her trousseau.\" \"Hadn't she? Well, I promise you she has now. It is worth while being married, if only to be initiated into the mysteries of a lady's requirements in the article of toilette, and the extreme ingenuity with which she contrives to discover new wants every day. Five and thirty packages, with my name on them, were landed at Folkestone, as I am a living sinner ; and, when I ventured on a mild remonstrance, I was told, in a voice of thunder, that every one was needed, and that it had required the greatest skill to pack all her effects into so small a compass. I was silenced ; but, as a wife cannot very decently beat her husband before company, I will now confess that I was not convinced.\" \" It was all owing to your making me so many presents,\" said Lady Brentford. \" You"], [115, "107 THE CARYLLS. would not have wished me to leave them behind.\" \"What is this?\" asked Lady Mary, taking out a longish box. \" Open it, Mary, and let us see,\" rejoined Beatrice ; and a wig of real auburn hair, with a tinge of gold in it, surmounted by a wreath, was drawn forth. \" Oh ! what a lovely shade,\" she continued, with childish delight. \" And, Mary, look at these shoes and silk stockings ! and, I declare, a fan and two pairs of gloves ! It is really a great deal too bad. How could you let him, Maud ?\" \" Oh ! Maud had a finger in the pie, too. I left it to her to order certain undergarments, with which my delicacy would not allow me to interfere. They are quite at the bottom.\" \" Never mind them now ; we can look at them by-and-bye. But how shall I ever per suade Mrs. Howe to let me dress her out ?\" \" Tell her it is a peace-offering from an old admirer.\" \" There will be no difficulty about the gown ; but the gloves, and shoes and stock-"], [116, "108 THE CARYLLS. ings, she will rebel against ; as for the wig, I feel sure she will tear it to pieces.\" \" You must represent to her that they were made expressly for her, under the supervision of Madame Chemisette, the most renowned artiste oi the day. One of her own nation and sex was measured for them, so I hope they will fit.\" \" Dear Brentford, I am really very angry with you for having spent your money in this way. But it would be too ungracious to scold you, so I thank you in Mrs. Howe's name and my own, for I know you did it to please me ; and though it may sound very silly, I own you have succeeded. I think every article beautiful, and in the very best taste. To-morrow you must all help me to put them on their rightful owner. Now let us have some tea, and then a short round of vingt-et un ; but I must warn you against Brownie, she is a horrid cheat.\" But the morrow brought other thoughts and other feelings. In the sorrow created by John's condition, Mrs. Howe was com-"], [117, "109 THE CARYLLS. pletely forgotten. Lady Mary Segrave, who had met him about half a dozen times, neither was, nor professed to be, greatly affected, but she sympathised truly with the deep grief evident!}' felt by Maud, and the sorrow loudly expressed by Beatrice, who was really grateful for his well-meant and courteously worded strictures on some of her propensi ties, and, under the sense of obligation, looked upon him as the beau ideal of what a clergy man ought to be. \" Oh, how I pity you both 1\" she said to Edward and Walter, when they all met in the morning \u2014 Lady Brentford did not make her appearance at breakfast \u2014 \" The little I saw of him while I was at Oakfield was suffi cient to prove to me that the loss of such a brother is irreparable. I feel it the more because he seemed to take such a kindly in terest in me, and I had fully intended asking him here for a short time, in hopes of profit ing by his instructions. I should have asked him to put my establishment upon a footing he would approve of; and now it is too late. But it is always the best who go first.\""], [118, "110 THE CARYLLS. This somewhat exaggerated declaration, and which probably would never have been carried out, though made in perfect good faith and sincerity at the time, tickled Lord Brent ford's sense of the ludicrous, when he thought of Beatrice's hunters, and pony carriage, and her liberal subscription to the hounds. Not withstanding the gravity of the occasion, he could not refrain from whispering to Lady Mary \u2014 \" What a wholesale reformation there would have been ! Poor Mrs. Howe little knows the escape she has had. She would un doubtedly have been the first discarded.\" Miss Leycester did not hear the words, but she noticed the whisper, and the manner in which it had been made. \" Now, Brentford,\" she said, warmly, \" if you have anything to say, say it out. I do not choose to be turned into ridicule, without knowing why and wherefore.\" \" My dear Beatrice,\" replied the offender, \" you cannot suppose that at any time, much less at a time like this, I should think of turning you into ridicule. I am as sorry for"], [119, "111 THE CARYLLS. poor John Caryll as you can be, but your intention of calling in a young man, not much older than yourself, clergyman though he be, to effect reforms in your household certainly did seem to me a little singular, and so I said to Mary. That was the head and front of my offending.\" \" Well, but it was a joke, and we are not in a humour for joking. And I do not see what age has to do with it. I only hope you may have half Mr. Caryll' s good quah ties when you are three times his age.\" \" To that I say most heartily, amen,\" re plied his lordship. \u2022**\u25a0\u2014\u25a0\u2014 aux ames bien nees, La vertu n'attend pas le nombre des amides said Lady Mary, with a slight variation from the original text, as she rose from the break fast table. \" Do you still wish me to attempt your likeness, Major Caryll ?\" \" Certainly, if you have no objection. It will please Maud, and she will need some thing to divert her thoughts, poor girl.\" \" Then we will begin as soon as the things"], [120, "112 THE CARYLLS. are taken away. May we remain here, Bea trice ? it is such a good light.\" \" Here, or wherever you like best,\" replied the lady of the house. \" You forgive me, Bee ? \" asked Lord Brentford, as she left the room with him and Walter. \" Of course I do. I know you never mean to say anything that can seriously annoy or give pain to anyone. But you are so thought less ; you really ought to try to correct your self, now that you are married,\" Miss Ley cester replied, with the air and dignity of a matron of forty. \" What has become of Miss Browne ?\" said Walter. \" Oh, she breakfasted two hours afo, and is probably at the school in the village. She is an early riser, which I am ashamed to say I am not. But come, let me show you my domain, or part of it, at least.\" \" I will leave you to show it Walter,\" said Lord Brentford. \" I must go and see after my poor Maud. She has been in tears all"], [121, "113 THE CARYLLS. the morning, and complains of a terrible headache.\" \" Do ; and try to make her join us. We shall be in the garden or shrubbery, and this morning sun will do her all the good in the world.\" Lord Brentford left them, and the two found themselves once more alone. But there was not the slightest embarrassment on either side. The lady appeared to have completely forgotten the relation in which the gentleman once stood to her, and the gentleman himself was too much preoccupied with other thoughts to call it to mind at that moment. The con versation at first turned on the Brentfords, and Beatrice warmly congratulated her com panion on their happiness, and the perfect confidence which seemed to exist between them. \" And what pleases me most,\" she con tinued, \" is that I can see, from several little things, that Maud is gradually acquiring great influence over her husband. It will be better for both of them.\" \" Maud's loving heart and good sense must"], [122, "114 THE CARYLLS. obtain influence over all who know her,\" re plied Walter. \" But I hope the influence will be mutual ; I should be sorry, both for her sake and his, to see Brentford sink into a nonentity.\" \" You mistake my meaning. Brentford will not sink into a nonentity, but he is indolent, and requires some one to spur him to exertion. I am much mistaken if Maud will be satisfied with his being a mere dummy in Parliament. He has a good deal of general information, though he keeps it to himself, and a certain amount of talent, and she will urge him to make use of them. I should not be surprised if he were to distinguish himself under her M auspices. \" Do you think it necessary that a man should be led by his wife?\" \" Certainly not ; but I think that when two persons live together in so intimate an union, one must, of necessity, obtain a predominance over the other, and it is for that reason \u2014 but tell me about yourself,\" she said, abruptly changing the subject. \"What change does your brother's condition make in your prospects ?\""], [123, "115 THE CARYLLS. Walter entered into a statement of all that concerned him, of John's proposal to him to take the living, and of his having declined it, with all the details therewith connected, and ended by asking her if she thought he had acted properly. \" Quite so,\" she replied. \" I do not think the life of a country clergyman would suit you at all.\""], [124, "116 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER VI. But if the tete-&-tete of the younger couple was free from all embarrassment or arrihre pensee, the same can hardly be said of the artist and her sitter, as far as the latter, at least, was concerned. Lady Mary wTorked on with the ardour and indifference to all ex ternal objects of one who was solely occupied with the business before her, but it was far different with Edward Caryll. He had no thing to do but to sit and gaze on her, whom he was now conscious of loving with all the devotion of a heart which had never wavered from its first allegiance. He saw her now in all the radiance of her womanly beauty, which the last ten years had but served fully to develop ; her figure had gained in sym metry and grace what it had lost in youthful elasticity ; the tones of her voice were low"], [125, "THE CARYLLS. 117 and sweet as ever ; what change there was in her personal appearance was all for the better. Her kindly nature, the goodness of her heart, her intellectual qualities, he had every reason to believe were still the same. That her powers of attraction still remained in full force he felt to his cost. The conversation flagged. Lady Mary had made a few abortive attempts, but finding her companion's answers rather short, and some- times not much to the purpose, she concluded that his thoughts were with his suffering brother, and, unwilling to disturb him, went on with her work in silence. But though his thoughts had not taken the direction which she imagined, his mind was fully occupied. Memory was busily retracing every scene of his life in which Mary Oakley had borne a part, from the days of their childhood to the last time he had pressed her hand before her acceptance of Colonel Segrave was made known. Ah, had he but seen the slightest sign in her deportment which could give him the shadow of a hope, notwithstanding all his heroic resolutions, he would have declared"], [126, "118 THE CARYLLS. his love, and implored her to unite her fate to his. But for such a sign he looked in vain. Although alone with him, to whose expres sions of devoted attachment she had once lent a willing ear, if she had not absolutely accepted them, not a trace of emotion was to be seen on that calm, pure brow ; no sigh escaped her ; no tremor was to be detected in her voice when she addressed him. She seemed to have lost all recollection of the past. And how should it be otherwise ! Had he not, on occasion of renewing his acquaint ance with her, taken the very superfluous pre caution of informing her that they could never again be to each other what they had once been ! Had he not told her that, if ever he found himself becoming attached to any woman, he would never see her more. Fool, infatuated fool! He had done his best to eradicate every lingering feeling of preference which she might still have retained for him, and he had succeeded. As this thought crossed his mind his brow contracted, and an appearance of pain swept across his countenance, which somewhat dis-"], [127, "119 THE CARYLLS. composed Lady Mary in her attempt to catch the expression of his features. \" I was wrong,\" she said, \" to propose your sitting to-day, when you have so much to agitate and grieve you. It is impossible for me to do justice to you, and I should like to produce something which could recall to Maud your usual cheerful appearance. I feel half inclined to put it off till we meet in London.\" \" No, do not do that, I entreat of you ; it is so uncertain what time I may have to dispose of in town. I know I must have worn a very sombre appearance for the last half hour, and if I was not so sure of your good nature I should feel it necessary to apologize for it. 1 was giving way to a train of thought which it would be better and wiser to cast on one side altogether. However, I can pro mise to indulge in it no more now, and if you can be persuaded to continue, you shall find me as obedient and docile as if I were a model sitting for my daily bread.\" He was as good as his word, and they soon found themselves engaged in discussing their"], [128, "120 THE CARYLLS. several plans. Edward, in answer to a ques tion of Lady Mary's, said that he expected to sail that day three weeks, and that he must be with his regiment, which was stationed in the north-western provinces, early in Sep tember.\" \" We need not then say adieu here,\" Lady Mary observed. \" I return at the end of the week myself.\" \" Does Miss Leycester accompany you?\" \" Yes ; but she is to go first to the Brent fords, before she comes to me.\" \" What an attentive hostess she is !\" re marked Major Caryll. \" Certainly her own house is the place in which one sees her to the best advantage.\" And so the conversation jogged on ; but, though Edward played his part conscien tiously, and to the best 'of his ability, the effort was manifest, and they both felt a sen sation of relief when the door opened, and Lord and Lady Brentford entered the room. \" Dearest Maud,\" said Lady Mary, \" how are you feeling now ? I hope you have got rid of your head-ache.\""], [129, "121 THE CARYLLS. \" Yes, dearest, thank you ; at least it is better. Oh, Edward, novv I know why you came to meet me here; it was the kindest proof you could have given me of your af fection.\" \" My dear Miud,\" replied her brother, \" I thought you would bear this great affliction better if some of us were at hand to support you, and I eagerly accepted Miss Leycester's invitation. In this difficult task we must assist each other; John will be the first to show us the way and encourage us. We have still many blessings to be thankful for.\" \" Ah, yes, that is true, indeed. I at least, have much to be thankful for ; you do not know how kind and considerate Brentford has been. If I am to lose a brother, God has blessed me in the husband he has given me to repair his loss.\" Lady Brentford was not much in the habit of giving such forcible expression to her feel ings, and her husband was considerably em barrassed by this public act of thanksgiving. \" My dear Maud,\" he said, blushing as he vol. n. st"], [130, "122 THE CARYLLS. spoke, \" how you exaggerate! I did no more than what any man with a grain of feeling would have done. And now let us say no more on the subject. Remember your promise to make no further unnecessary allusions to the cause of our affliction.\" \" I will try. And where is Walter ?\" \" Beatrice took possession of him and car ried him off an hour ago,\" said Lady Mary. \" And now come and tell me what you think of your brother's likeness.\" \" Capital ! I should have known him any where. A little too stern and serious, per haps, but an excellent likeness.\" \" The gravity is my fault,\" said Edward. \" I am afraid I am not as patient a sitter as Lady Mary deserves.\" \" I am softening that down,\" replied her ladyship. \" I will make you look quite ani mated before I have done.\" Again the door opened, and Miss Leycester made her appearance, followed by Walter Caryll. \"My dear Maud,\" she exclaimed, \"why"], [131, "THE CARYLLS. 123 would you not join us ? I am sure you would have been all the better for it.\" \" I had a headache, and I was lazy ; but I really should like a little stroll now. Will you come with me, Walter ? We will not go far, so I will just throw this shawl over my head.\" Walter was quite ready, and they left the room together. Lord Brentford made a step towards the door to follow them, but Lady Mary stopped him. \"Better leave them to themselves,\" she said. \" Upon my word,\" he rejoined, \" these are pretty doings. Pray, Miss Leycester, do you allow them in your house ? Not only separ ating husband and wife, but facilitating her abduction by another man. If you do, all I can say is that I am ashamed of you.\" \"My dear Brentford, I will answer you when I am in better spirits. How well you have succeeded in catching the likeness, Mary. I really think it will be your chef d'\u0153uvre. It is easy to see that you have been working at it con amore.\" a 2"], [132, "124 THE CARYLLS. At this untoward speech Edward coloured violently, fortunately unnoticed, and ventured to cast a timid glance towards Lady Mary. Even that lady's colour rose a little, but she answered quietly and calmly \u2014 \" I have indeed. I wished to give Maud as good a likeness as I could of the brother she will not see for so long.\" \" Oh ! how I wish,\" exclaimed Beatrice, \" that I had a likeness of poor Mr. Caryll.\" \" If you would be satisfied with a photo graph,\" said Edward, \" I can promise you one. He left half a dozen with me to dispose of as I liked.\" \" Oh ! thank you ; I should like it of all things. I shall prize it as one of my most precious souvenirs. There is no one whom I respect more than your poor brother.\" Lord Brentford had an observation on the tip of his tongue, but he had the good sense to suppress it. \" And if you have a photograph of yourself, Major Caryll,\" she continued, \" you ought to give it me, too. I have two albums \u2014 one for my friends, and the other for my acquaintance."], [133, "125 THE CARYLLS. Of course you will take your place amongst my friends.\" \" You shall have one certainly. I feel greatly honoured by the place assigned to it ; not in complimentary phrase, but truly and sincerely.\" \" And you ought to give Mary one too, in payment for your portrait.\" \" I have had one these six months,\" said her ladyship. \" Have you ? How odd I never noticed it in your album.\" \" That would have been difficult, as the album was full, and I put it away till I got a new one. And now, Major Caryll, I will release you from your penance. I can finish the sketch now without troubling you again.\" After luncheon Miss Leycester proposed a ride. She had three, what she simply called, riding-horses, but in truth they were first-rate hunters for a light weight ; in addition to which she had her two ponies for harness. \" What I propose,\" she said, \" is to mount Major Caryll aud Walter ; and Brentford can drive Maud, and Mary, and Brownie in the"], [134, "126 THE CARYLLS. pony-carriage. There is very good room for four, if you do not take a servant. If anyone has any objection to make, let him speak now, or sor ever after hold his tongue.\" The only objection came from Lady Mary, who thought it rather chilly for a drive, and would greatly prefer a walk, if Miss Browne would bear her company, to which that lady, who had rather a horror of the pony-chaise, willingly consented. Brentford and his wife were therefore left to a conjugal tete-^-tete. \" And, dear Brentford,\" said Beatrice, \" promise me to be steady, and not play any tricks with them. They are very good now, but I had some trouble with them at first, and I do not wish to have to begin all over again. And recollect, I am in the habit of letting them out a little near the bottom of a hill to spring them up the next; so you must be careful, for they are apt to get a little fidgetty.\" \" All right,'' responded his lordship. \" Any further instructions ?\" \" None. If you go through the turnpike, you need not pay. I make an annual com-"], [135, "127 THE CARYLLS. position with them, which saves no end of time and trouble.\" \" What a head that girl has !\" said Lord Brentford, as he handed his wife into the carriage. \" She would make a capital prime minister, or even huntsman. She has all her wits about her, and is never at a loss.\" \" Good head, and good heart,\" rejoined Maud. \" Both. Next to you and Flo, I think I love her better than any woman I know.\" \"What, better than Mary!\" she asked, slily. \" Oh well, no ; I don't suppose I do. But it is very unfeeling in you to allude in that cold-blooded way to my blighted hopes.\" Miss Leycester's abode was situated in the most beautiful part of one of the most beautiful counties in England, and as she and her com panions cantered along the lanes, with their hedges springing into leaf, and the banks covered with primroses, violets, and anemo nies, beneath the genial rays of an April sun, with a bracing westerly breeze, and birds singing from every twig, they all felt an ex-"], [136, "128 THE CARYLLS. hilaration of spirits which nothing could damp. \" What a lovely country !\" exclaimed Edward. \" We are pretty well off in that respect at the Holt, but you beat us hollow.'' \" Yes ; I have been in many parts of Eng land, and have never seen anything I prefer to it. But then it is Home, and that I suppose always has an effect on one's judgment. And then in this bright day you see it under every advantage, for, with all my partiality to Hert fordshire, I must confess that in winter our lanes are something of the deepest.\" \" We are certainly most fortunate in our weather,\" observed Walter, \" and to-day seems to have been made especially for riding.\" \" Doesn't it ? Oh, how I should like just a little lark across the country ! \" she rejoined, looking towards the Major. \" Well, why should we not ? \" he replied. \" It will be my last in England for many a long day, I suspect.\" \" Well, then,\" she exclaimed, with anima tion, \"do you see that windmill on the hill? It is a little more than two miles off, and there"], [137, "129 THE CARYLLS. is a splendid view from it. We will have a steeple-chase to it, and the winner is to receive half-a-crown from each of the losers. Shall we?\" \" I am quite willing,\" said Edward and his brother. \" Though it really is a great shame in me,\" she continued, \" and looks like taking you in, for I know every inch in the country, and I believe have been over every fence in it. To say nothing of your horses not being quite up to your weight in a fast thing ; but I confess I like a bet upon a race. And you see that green field just on the rise of the hill ; we must avoid that, for the wheat is very forward, and my neighbour Mr. White would make a row about it. The best ground is on the left of it. We will start fair from the other side of the hedge.\" She turned her horse over a gap into the next field, followed by her companions. \"Now, are you both ready? Then, go,\" she said. And in another moment she was skimming over the meadow with Edward and G 5"], [138, "130 THE CARYLLS. Walter, one on each side of her, half a horse's length in the rear. The enclosures were small, and the fences came in quick succession, but she took them so quietly and with so much judgment, that Edward, who was soon sailing alongside of ber, could not refrain from ex pressing his admiration. Walter, who was a heavier weight than hie brother, notwithstand ing all his efforts, gradually dropped astern, making, as they neared the goal, a desperate but unsuccessful effort to retrieve his lost ground. The last few hundred yards were over a green sward leading up to the mill, intersected by a flight of hurdles which Bea trice took in gallant style, a few seconds before the Major, and won a most exciting race by a couple of lengths. \" Isn't it fun ? \" she exclaimed, jumping off her horse and patting him, her face glowing with excitement, and radiant with delight at her victory. \" Capital fun,\" he replied ; \" and unlike most races, as good fun for the losers as for the winners. Allow me to pay my stake.\" \" Upon your honour you did your best? \""], [139, "131 THE CARYLLS. she asked, before taking the half-crown tendered for her acceptance. \" My very best, upon my honour ; but to witness such a performance is worth many half-crowns. I know not which most to admire, seat or hand, courage or judgment.\" \" Ah, my poor Walter,\" she said, as the laggard joined them, \" you threw away the little chance you had, when you blew Queen Mab over that ridge and furrow ; but by good rights you ought to have had the Brick iastead of your brother. He is better up to your weight.\" \" Have I then had the honour of riding upon a brick all this time ? \" asked Edward. \" Yes, we call him the Brick ever since a long run, in which he carried me to perfection ; a kill in the open, and the last mile at racing speed. There were only three others in at the death. But come, let us go and see Mrs. Hayley, the miller's wife. We will ask her for a cup of tea.\" A boy came out of the mill and offered to hold the horses. \" Well, Sam, how is your father getting"], [140, "132 THE CARYLLS. on ?\" she asked, for she knew everybody in the neighbourhood, far and near, and all about them. \" Purely, Miss ; doctor says he'll soon be at work again, and mother's so thankful for the wine you sent him.\" Miss Leycester appeared to stand high in Mrs. Hayley's good graces. That worthy dame busied herself in preparing tea sor them, with brown bread fresh from the oven, and butter and cream of a quality unknown to the dwellers within the bills of mortality. When the meal was over, and Beatrice was following her escort out of the house, Mrs. Hayley, who was a fervent partisan of the doctrines preached by Lucy Shoreham, caught hold of her sleeve, and whispered \u2014 \" Is it to be one of them, Miss Beatrice? They are a sightly couple, surelie ; but the Major for my money.\" Beatrice laughed, and, much to her disap pointment, assured her that nothing of the sort was in contemplation ; she then joined her companions. \" Now, Sam,\" she said, as soon as she was"], [141, "133 THE CARYLLS. in her saddle, \" if I give you half-a-crown what will you do with it ?\" \"Take it to mother, miss.\" \" That's a good boy ; here are two for you to take to mother, and tell her to send down to me if she wants anything for your father.\" They turned their horses' heads home wards. \" That I call cheap charity,\" she said, \" giving away your two half-crowns.\" \" Well, I am not so sure of that,\" replied Edward. \" Money earned by great exertion, at the risk of life and limb, can hardly be called cheaply earned.\" \" I am so sorry you are all going to morrow, for I suppose you know the Brent fords leave me, too. Poor Maud is anxious to get home, and the wish is so natural that I could not say anything against it.\" \" Brentford told us this morning,\" said Walter; \"but we shall soon meet again in London.\" \" Oh, London is not the same thing ; I hate London. Besides, your brother will soon"], [142, "134 THE CARYLLS. be on his way to India. Here we should have such fun together ; even our poor little steeple chase of to-day will form quite an epi sode in my life.\" \" I think, Miss Leycester,\" said Edward, \" you will soon find the ground too hard for much more fun of this sort.\" \" I suppose I shall ; not that it much mat ters ; my riding is over for some time to come. Mary has quite given it up, and next week I am to join the Brentfords in London. Lord Isleworth insists upon his taking his seat at once, and in this my uncle is right. Novv, let us have one good canter more. At least, I shall have the consolation of knowing that my last ride was a remarkably pleasant one.\" On arriving at May Bank, they found Lord Brentford smoking a cigar in the porch- \" How did you get on?\" Miss Leycester asked ; \" you know you may smoke in the billiard-room, if you prefer it.\" a Thanks ; just now I prefer the open air. We got on famously ; Lady Brentford, Lord Brentford, and the ponies were as good as gold.\""], [143, "135 THE CARYLLS. During the evening it seemed to be the great object of all assembled to avoid every topic and allusion, which could, by any pos sibility, recall John Caryll's dangerous state, and yet it was difficult to evade them alto gether. Vingt-et-un was not proposed, but conversation never flagged, and was carried on in a tolerably cheerful tone. \" And so,\" said Lord Brentford, not know ing at whose suggestion the resolution had been taken, \" you have quite made up your mind to give up hunting, Bee ?\" \" Quite so ; that is to say fox-hunting. I dare say I shall take a gallop with the harriers now and then.\" \" That is a step in advance, at all events,\" said Lady Mary. \" Or backwards.\" replied Miss Leycester. \" I wanted to keep a pack myself, but I found I could not afford it, unless I hunted them myself, with Brownie to whip in to me, and that she very ill-naturedly refused to do.\" \" You know, Beatrice,\" replied the lady accused, \" I never could ride on horseback in my life.\""], [144, "136 THE CARYLLS. \"Did you ever try?\" \" No ; I cannot say that I ever did.\" \" Then how can you possibly know if you can ride or not ? However, I shall do pretty well. There is a subscription pack within reach ; I mean to sell one of my horses, and with what his keep would cost me I can make it worth their while to come into this part of the world a little oftener.\" \" Well, you certainly are the best and cle verest manager I know,\" said Lord Brentford. \" I wish my father had you for his steward.\" \" Thank you, my lord, for your good word. My cousin John\u2014 By-the-bye, Maul, I have never congratulated any of you on Louisa's approaching marriage. Were you not sur prised when you heard of it ?\" \" Beyond measure,\" Lady Brentford replied. \" It will be delightful to have her settled so near us all.\" \"We were all surprised,\" said Lord Brent ford. \" But what surprises me the most is to hear on all sides that master John is really over head and ears in love. I did not think it had been in him.\""], [145, "137 THE CARYLLS. \"There is nothing so wonderful in that,\" Lady Mary remarked. \" I think Louisa, for regular beauty, as near perfection as can be imagined.\" \" I confess I was delighted when I heard of it,\" rejoined Beatrice. \" I like what I saw of Louisa so much, that I am enchanted at the thoughts of having her for a cousin. And now I think of it, I shall have you all for cousins by marriage. Cousin Edward, will you accept me as such ?\" \" Can you ask it ? I shall always feel proud of my relationship to my cousin Beatrice.\" \" How many cousins I shall gain !\" She was going to number them, but the recollec tion of John stopped her. \" And Mary may put in a claim, too,\" she continued. \" In short, we are now a regular family party.\" \" That being settled to our general satisfac tion,\" said Lady Mary, \" I shall wish you good-night. It is half-past eleven.\" \" So it is, I declare,\" exclaimed Miss Ley cester. \" Cousin Walter, ring the bell for the candles.\""], [146, "138 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER VII. The Brentsords left May Bank soon after breakfast on the following day, to suit the rather complicated system of trains by which they were to reach the Holt, where they in tended passing the rest of the week, before proceeding to London. The parting between the Carylls and their sister was a melancholy one on both sides, and Maud shed many tears at the thought of the unhappiness which awaited her at home ; a home which for many years had been singularly free from the afflic tions and trials to which human nature is ex posed. Her brothers did their best to comfort her, but it was Edward who supplied her with the strongest motive for exercising her self control. \"For our father's sake,\" he said, \"you must endeavour to bear up. There can be no"], [147, "139 THE CARYLLS. doubt that he has been much shaken, and though he had in a great measure recovered his strength and composure when I left him, any fresh agitation cannot fail to be extremely injurious to him. And I say the same of John. While he is quiet he is tolerably free from suffering, but if anything agitates him, it brings on a fit of coughing, whi-jh literally seems to tear him to pieces.\" \" You may be sure I will do my best,\" she replied ; \" but the first meeting will be most painful. It is that I dread.\" \" Mind you write to me, Maud, and tell me how you find them all,\" said Walter. Soon after luncheon, Edward and Walter also took their departure. \" And if you like to smoke in the train, and tell them you come from May Bank, I dare say there will be no objection. All the guards know me,\" were Miss Leycester's parting words. \" How well and reasonably Walter be haved,'' observed Lady Mary, when she returned to the drawing-room with Beatrice, after seeing their guests off. \" He has really"], [148, "140 THE CARYLLS. shown a command over himself for which I hardly gave him credit.\" \" Has he?\" said Miss Leycester, in an ab sent manner. \" Has he ! Why, did you not observe it yourself? But it is my belief you did not hear my observation. Where have your thoughts wandered to?\" \" Oh, yes ! I heard what you said. But, my dear Mary, I suspect Walter is beginning to find out the mistake he made in fancying himself in love with me, and I was thinking what a scrape I should have been in if I had accepted him.\" \" Impossible, Beatrice ! I have no doubt that the impression will wear out in time, but 1 cannot believe that the change has begun already.\" \" Well, you may be right ; but at present I adhere to my own opinion. And I am very glad of it ; it will be pleasanter for all of us. Oh, Brownie,\" she continued, as that lady entered the room, \"you come just at the right time. I want to see if we can persuade Mrs. Howe to let us dress her like a lady.\""], [149, "THE CARYLLS. 141 In the meantime the brothers pursued their journey to London in silence, which neither of them felt inclined to break, for both found ample occupation in communing with their own thoughts. Walter was pleasingly en gaged in planning a visit to Seymour Place that very evening, when the Woods were sure to be at home ; the only drawback being a vague sort of dread that his brother might make some claim upon his time, which, of course, under the circumstances, he could not reject. Edward's musings, on the contrary, were far from being of so satisfactory a nature, and the more he thought of his approaching departure from England, and the many ties which, if not severed, must of necessity be loosened, the more his depression increased. He endeavoured to persuade himself that the anxious thoughts with which his mind was filled had reference solely to his family, and the many changes which would, in all proba bility, take place in it before he returned after his long absence; to be received, perhaps, almost as a stranger, by those who now felt for him the warmest affection, and looked up"], [150, "142 THE CARYLLS. to him with confidence as their natural guar dian and protector. No doubt it was a dis heartening prospect, but conscience told him tbat it was overdrawn. Happen what might, notwithstanding any number of years of ab sence, he felt that nothing but death could ever dissolve the bonds of mutual attachment which held all the members of the Caryll family united. Why then should he despond, when he was only following the example of hundreds and thousands, whom duty sepa rated for years from all they loved ? This time it was his heart which gave the response. It was no doubt of Caryll love that infected him with these tremors. It was the parting, a parting which he felt must be final, from the woman he loved with passionate devotion. He would return to find others unchanged, but, as regarded Lady Mary Segrave, he had no such hope to support him. He had now been living for months in habits of close in timacy with her, and though he was con vinced that he occupied a high place in her regard, he was obliged to confess that beyond that, he had every reason to believe that he"], [151, "143 THE CARYLLS. had made no progress. He stood now just where he did ten months ago, without a hope of advancing further. As this conviction forced itself upon him, he felt that the best thing he could do was to tear himself from her society altogether, which now brought him more pain than pleasure, more discontent than satisfaction. Perhaps a prolonged ab sence and a more active life might enable him to overcome his weakness. \" After all,\" he said, aloud, with something like a sigh, \" all is for the best.\" \" What is for the best ?\" asked Walter. \"My departure. I have been weighing all the advantages and disadvantages, and have arrived at the conclusion that the balance is all in favour of my going. I am weary, utterly weary of the life I have been leading for the last ten years, and long for a change. I feel that, if things were to go on much longer as they are, I should either sink into indolence, or become a confirmed grumbler.\" \"Yes, I have no doubt such a thorough change of scene will do you good, putting on one side professional prospects, and you will"], [152, "144 THE CARYLLS. come back to us loving home better than ever. We are more to be pitied than you.\" \"What changes I shall find when I do re turn! How many new acquaintances I shall have to make ! Half-a-dozen young Oakleys ; half-a-dozen young Leycesters ; and as many new Shorehams, perhaps ; and very likely a Mrs. Walter Caryll, with children round her.\" \" Well, certainly your estimate of increas ing Caryll population is on the most liberal scale,\" said Walter, laughing. \" But per haps you will bring us back a Mrs. Edward \u2014 I beg her pardon\u2014 a Mrs. Caryll to charm us all.\" \" I do not think I should go to India for a wife ; unless, indeed, some rich Begum were to take a fancy to me, with pearls and dia monds enough to purchase a principality, which is not likely. But what do you say to lighting a cigar, and trying the talisman of cousin Beatrice's name ?\" \" We shall only get pulled up and fined at a police court.\" \" I hope not. I look upon all directors of"], [153, "145 THE CARYLLS. railways as the natural enemies of mankind \u2014 regular Ishmaels ; and I should be very sorry to put forty shillings, or whatever it may be, into their pockets. But I have faith in Miss Leycester's protection ;\" saying which, he drew forth a cigar and lighted it. His brother followed his example. At the first station the guard put his head into the carriage, which was filled with smoke and reeking with the smell of tobacco. \" Sorry to say, gentlemen, this is uot allowed.\" \" Miss Leycester assured us,\" said Edward, \" that if we mentioned her name, you would allow us to smoke these very innocent cigars \u2014 which are made expressly for railway travelling \u2014 and which, as you may perceive, leave neither smell nor smoke behind them.\" The man grinned. \" Do you come from Miss Leycester's, sir?\" \" Left May Bank an hour ago.\" \" All right, sir, and I am sorry I disturbed you ; but please not to show them at the stations,\" said the guard, touching his hat, VOL. II. h"], [154, "146 THE CARYLLS. and barely condescending to pocket the half crown Edward slipped into his hand. \" Now, infidel, I have thee on the hip. What have you to say to that?\" exclaimed Edward. \" She is wonderful \u2014 perfectly wonderful. I declare that, if she were to send me to nego tiate a treaty with the most missionary-eating cannibals of central Africa, and assured me of her protection, I should depart without a doubt or a fear. Instead of civis Bomanus, of w7hich we heard so much at one time, I should be quite content with the title of civis Beatricius.\" \" And nothing more?\" asked Edward. \" Nothing more. I know what you mean, but I am novv quite convinced that Beatrice will never look npon me in any other light than that of a friend. I confess it gave me great pain when I arrived at that conviction ; but it is worse than idle to sigh after what is unattainable, or to give one's self up to lamen tations for what is irremediable. I had a hard struggle, but I trust I have conquered.\" \" That is, indeed, true philosophy ; but how"], [155, "THE CARYLLS. 147 few attain it !\" said Edward, who gave his brother more credit for courage than he deserved. They were now running into the London station. \"What are your plans, and when am I to see you again ?\" asked Walter. \" I cannot make any plans till I see what I have to do. I suspect, however, my next fortnight will be fully occupied. To-night I mean to dine at the club, where I shall pro bably meet some men I want to see. I would ask you to dine with me, but I go there on business, not for pleasure. You would be bored, and, to speak honestly, you would be in the way. If you will breakfast with me to-morrow at the hotel, we can then make future arrangements.\" \" That will suit me perfectly ; and, to tell you the truth, I have no particular wish to meet men I do not know. If it had been a tete-i-tete dinner with you, it would have been different.\" \" Perhaps I can still manage it,\" said h 2"], [156, "148 THE CARYLLS. Edward. He reflected for a moment, and Walter began to tremble for what might be the consequences of his hypocrisy. Great therefore was -his relief when his brother con tinued, \"No, I must stand by my original plan. To change it would throw me back four and twenty hours, and I have no time to lose. Sorry for it, old fellow ; but our ap pointment must be for ten o'clock to-morrow.\" They shook hands and entered their respec tive cabs. \" At last,\" exclaimed Walter, as he issued from the station, \" At last, Annie, I shall see you again! \" And this time he was not doomed to dis appointment. He timed his visit so well that he found the two ladies just sitting down to tea. \" Mr. Caryll! \" said Mrs. Wood, as he made his appearance at the door of their sitting room, \" This is indeed an unexpected pleasure. We began to think that we should never see you again. At least I did, for I must do Annie the justice to say that she has always"], [157, "149 THE CARYLLS. expressed the firmest reliance on your promise to pay us another visit.\" \" Thank you, Miss Wood,\" replied Walter, turning towards the young lady, on whose cheek he saw, or fancied he saw, the slightest possible tinge of additional colour. \" And novv that I am come, I am afraid that it is at an inconvenient hour ; but I was so anxious to explain the causes of my prolonged absence, and to make my excuses for it, that I thought only of myself instead of thinking of you.\" \" As far as we are concerned you could not have come at a more convenient time. Annie will give you a cup and plate, unless you are afraid of spoiling your dinner by a cup of tea.\" \" Dinner ! I dined hours ago, or at least eat a tremendous luncheon, which I mean to stand in lieu of it. I have only just arrived from Hertfordshire. But before anything else I must tell you how my time has been employed since I saw you.\" And then he went into a long detail of all he had been about, and the various events of the last fortnight. \" And the most provoking part of it was that all these engagements fell on the nights when I"], [158, "150 THE CARYLLS. knew you were free. There were several Museum nights when I had nothing to do.\" \" Annie has not been very well latterly, and for more than ten days has not been out of the house. It makes a sad break in her lessons.\" \" Annie ill ! How sorry I am to hear it. I thought you looking a little pale, but I trust it is nothing of consequence.\" \" Nothing, thank you,\" said Miss Wood. \" I got wet one night coming home from Ken sington, and had a cold in consequence. It was not much, but mamma would insist upon my keeping indoors. However, it is past now, and I begin my course again to-morrow.\" \" How I wish I had known it ! I would have come to play chess with you, as we used to do in the good old times. I wonder if you could give me a pawn now and beat me.\" He could not refrain from a smile, as he recol lected that Miss Harebell's superiority at chess had been one of the objections he had urged against that young lady. \" Why did you not write me a line to tell me, Mrs. Wood?\" \" In the first place, I did not know your"], [159, "151 THE CARYLLS. address ; and as that is a very sufficient reason I need not seek for more. Do you think if I had known where to address you, I should not have had the decency, leaving gratitude out of the question, to write to thank you for your magnificent present. What could Major Caryll want with such a stock of good things ?\" \" Oh, Edward always has lots of fellows dropping in to breakfast, or luncheon, or supper, and as he is leaving England he made over the contents of his larder to me.\" He was obliged to maintain his first impudent piece of imposture, though it is but fair to add that he had the grace to blush as he did so. \" Well, they were most welcome, I assure you, and you must accept our thanks for them now. Annie has been living on them ever since.\" \" Oh what pleasure it gives me to think that they have been of any use ! \" And his glowing face left no doubt of his sincerity. \" I hope your brother is better, Mr. Caryll,\" said Mrs. Wood. \" No, I grieve to say that, not only he is no better, but there are no hopes of his"], [160, "152 THE CARYLLS. recovery. Ah, Mrs. Wood, we have been such a happy, united family, and now it is all breaking up. Edward going to India ; John dying ; my father growing old ; my sisters marrying. The Holt will no longer be what it has been.\" \" Dear Walter ! \" said Mrs. Wood,-\" I cannot help giving you your old name \u2014 we can sympathize with you, for we too have known what it is to see a family broken up ; but your sister's marriage ought to be a source of consolation. I have heard Lord Brentford so highly spoken of, and in a worldly point of view he must be all you can desire.\" \" Oh, Maud will do very well ; I have no fear for her, but \u2014 '' He stopped short, for it struck him that to introduce Mr. John Leycester's name might require very delicate handling. The scand alous part of the story to which Major Caryll had alluded was too absurd to merit contra diction, or even dwell upon his mind for a moment, but he had a strong suspicion that at one time Annie Wood had indulged in a sort of girlish attachment to his sister's suitor."], [161, "153 THE CARYLLS. Rumour even spoke of an engagement, though he could not believe that it had gone as far as that ; and when Mr. Leycester left Lynburn for Cambridge, the report died a natural death ; still he thought it advisable to men tion Louisa's intended marriage at some future day, when Miss Wood should not be present. In this resolution he would have been confirmed, had he chanced to cast his eyes towards her, and seen the look of agon ized supense with which she seemed to be awaiting the conclusion of his sentence. As it was. he looked steadfastly at the fire in em barrassed silence. \" But what?\" said Mrs. Wood, after a short pause ; \" you were saying \u2014 but something.'' \" Was I ? Oh, yes, I remember ; I was going to say, but however desirable a mar riage may be, it is always more or less a severance of home ties. We shall only be the secondary objects of Maud's affections ; Brentford will be the first, as he has every right to be.

She was good enough to offer to my acceptance a friend of her own ; luckily I discovered in time that she scolded and squinted.\" \"I suppose she has a good fortune to cover those defects.\" \" Yes, that I fancy was her great charm in Lucy's eyes ; and, indeed, a month ago, I could not have married without money ; now, if we lose poor John, I shall be independent, and can afford to marry to please myself; and that reminds me, I was very anxious to con sult you on the subject of the living which would have been his. However, as I was not able to call on you before I was obliged to come to a decision, and the thing is now settled, I will not bore you about it.\" But Mrs. Wood took too much interest in her husband's old pupil not to feel a little in quisitive as to his future prospects. She as-"], [163, "155 THE CARYLLS. sured him that so far from her thinking it a bore, nothing could give her greater pleasure than to listen to anything that affected the well-being of one for whom she had so great a regard. She was also not a little flattered by Walter's professed intention of asking her advice, although circumstances had prevented his doing so, a mischance which she greatly deplored. Thus encouraged, Walter began his narra tive, to which the worthy lady paid the greatest attention ; when, however, he wound up by announcing that, after mature delibera tion, and having consulted those on whose judgment he had great reliance, he had de clined his brother's proposal, her disappoint ment was great, and she asked anxiously if it was too late to reconsider his decision. \" Quite so,\" he replied ; \" the ans, ver I sent John was a final one, and he has already acted upon it.\" \" Then I am sorry, very sorry. How un fortunate that I did not see you in time. I am sure I should have proved to you that you ought to have accepted, that it was your"], [164, "156 THE CARYLLS. bounden duty to do so. Such a living, with house and garden, and a glebe on which you might have kept six cows. I made sure you would end by saying that you had taken your brother's advice. I cannot tell yTou how bit terly disappointed I am. Fifteen hundred a year literally going a begging. How many hundreds of poor curates there are who would think themselves rich with a tenth part of that sum. And whatever you may think, I feel quite certain you would make an excel lent clergyman, and no doubt you would have been a magistrate. Oh, Walter, how could you!\" And the good lady had some difficulty in refraining from tears, as she sunk back in her chair, exhausted with her exertions. Mr. Walter Caryll was fairly taken aback, and considerably discomposed by the verdict pronounced against him by so competent an authority. Perhaps, too, he was a little stunned by the flood of words in which Mrs. Wood had expressed her disapprobation of his proceedings. At all events, he did not at once collect his thoughts sufficiently to enter on his"], [165, "157 THE CARYLLS. defence. Luckily for him his cause was taken up by lips quite as able, and on this occasion probably more persuasive than his own. It was Miss Annie who entered the lists for him, and he felt all the more grateful to her for her advocacy, that it was totally unexpected. She had been sitting perfectly still for the last half hour, without uttering a word, apparently buried in her own thoughts, and, if the truth must he owned, Walter had felt a good deal piqued by the little interest she had manifested in a discussion so directly bearing upon his future fortunes. \"No, mother,\" she said, \"I think Mr. Caryll was quite right. When I remember my poor father's last illness, and his anguish at the thought of leaving his widow and daughter totally unprovided for, without any fault of his or ours, I could never advise a friend to adopt his profession. It is true, Mr. Caryll would have a large income, and if he lived long enough might save money, per haps to be robbed of it by some villain at last. And even this depends upon life, over which we have no control. My father was"], [166, "158 THE CARYLLS. not an old man, and he is dead ; Mr. John Caryll is a young man, and he is dying. Which of us can say that he will be alive to morrow ! I am convinced that the smallest independence upon which we can securely reckon as a provision for those we love, is better than a large income held upon the precarious tenure of life.\" \"Thank you, Miss Wood,\" said Walter; \" those are my own thoughts, though much better expressed than I could have done. But I should never have given you credit for having reflected so much upon the sub- ject.\" \" Reflect ! I have nothing to do but reflect. Do what I will, I am always calling to mind what we once were and what we are now, and then I think that, if my father had never been well off, if we had never known the comforts and luxuries with which his love surrounded us, if we had always been strug gling with poverty and privations, my pre sent life would be easy to me. I am not afraid of work, and it is not the present that is irksome to me so much as the recollection"], [167, "159 THE CARYLLS. of the past. But forgive me, Mr. Caryll ; I have no right to inflict my grievances on you.\" \" No, no ; do not say that, I entreat of you. It proves that you still look upon me as a friend. And now I say good-night; it will not be so long as last time before I see you again.\" As soon as the door closed on him, Annie exclaimed \u2014 \" Mother, I must know the truth ; you must find it out.\" \"I will do my best. But if it is true, what will you do then ?\" \" Ah, how can I tell ? Perhaps lay me down and die.''"], [168, "160 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER VIII. Never before had Walter seen Annie so much excited as she had been that night; never before had she given such unrestrained expression to her feelings. When he had known her in her father's house, though per fectly open in all the little occurrences of daily life, he could not recollect a single in stance in which she had ever made the slightest allusion to her feelings, one way or the other. In fact, she was decidedly re served, the only fault he had ever found in her, and this disposition harmonized well with the pensive and, at times, almost melan choly expression of her features. But now even this fault had disappeared, and Walter set down the constraint, under which she had seemed to labour in their intercourse at Lyn burn, to the very natural diffidence which a"], [169, "161 THE CARYLLS. girl might feel in her conversations with a boy younger than herself. Now this was evidently changed. The boy become man had been made the confidant of her most hidden feelings, and she must have been very sure of his sympathy before she could have brought herself to lay them bare to him. Nor was she wrong. The warmest sympathy, and more than sympathy, washers. But in such a case barren sympathy without fruits was not enough. How could he befriend her and her mother ? How could he make her com prehend how deeply he compassionated the unhappy position to which they were now reduced ? It was not a question easy of so lution. He felt that personally he could do nothing, and to endeavour to interest his friends in her favour required consideration. It might open the door to all sorts of awk ward enquiries and comments ; it might, per haps be of more detriment than advantage to her, and make her the subject of ill-natured remarks. Had she been fifty and marked with the small-pox, it would be different ; but in that case, very possibly Mr. Walter Caryll"], [170, "162 THE CARYLLS. would not have taken so deep an interest in her fortunes. Fortunately there was no particular neces- sity for coming to an immediate decision. As far as actual want went, he would take care that they should never know that, and he derived some satisfaction from the belief that, unfriended and unknown as they were, it was not likely that any interloper would step in and usurp his place. He began to look on Annie Wood as something peculiarly his own, or, at least, as entrusted to his peculiar care and protection ; his own pet lamb, with whom he would take very good care that no ravenous wolf should make free. Mrs. Wood, no doubt, would rejoice in finding so efficient a guardian for her daughter, and seemed very well inclined to allow him to resume his place as a member of her family. It had given him a thrill of pleasure when she had addressed him, as in days of yore, by his christian name. The position of two of the parties to this projected tripartite alliance being thus com fortably settled, it remained for him to con-"], [171, "163 THE CARYLLS. sider his own. From the time of his acci- dental meeting with her in Hyde Park, his old boyish attachment to Annie had revived, and the heart which Beatrice Leycester had left desolate and empty was now quite ready to receive a new tenant. If he was not actually in love, he was on the high road to it, and required but little encouragement to become so in earnest. But he had already burnt his fingers once ; he had received a lesson which made him cautious. If he had allowed himself to be so egregiously deceived by Miss Leycester's open-hearted familiarity, how much more difficult would it be for him to discover from Miss Wood's retiring man- ner the real state of her feelings ? From her mother, instinct told him that he would meet with every assistance ; but to owe his success in a suit of this nature to the patron- age of another was not to be thought of for a moment. On the other hand, although most girls in Annie's position would accept without hesitation an offer which would raise them to independence, he knew her honest pride too well to believe that she"], [172, "164 THE CARYLLS. would allow herself to be influenced by such considerations ; nor, if she were capable of it, would he wish to gain her favour by such means. Even to her gratitude he wished to owe nothing. How he really stood with her, with what eye she really regarded him he had not the slightest conception. She greeted him as a friend, but in her own house she could hardly do less ; and on the last occasion she had certainly bestowed on him less of her attention than usual. He thought he could see that to make sure of her affection would be a work of time ; but he com forted himself with the reflection that no building stands the firmer for being built in a day. There was another trifling consideration which, though he tried to pooh-pooh it, would force itself on his attention ; and that was, with what eyes his family would be likely to view such a connection, though what objec tions they could make, with any show of reason, he was at a loss to discover. She was a gentlewoman, and, if she had not a shilling"], [173, "THE CARYLLS. 165 to bless herself with, she had qualities which, even in an economical point of view, would make her a perfect treasure to a poor man, which he was not, or at least was not likely to remain. She was orderly, and used to priva tions; in her present humble abode he had seen her performing offices of almost a menial nature, not only without hesitation or re luctance, but with a cheerfulness which proved how ready she was to accommodate herself to the exigencies of her situation. That she was equally well qualified to take her place amongst the higher classes of society the popularity which she had enjoyed at Lyn burn and in the neighbourhood, where she was an universal favourite, sufficiently at tested. With such a wife, his domestic happiness would be insured, and the honours of the official residence, which, sooner or later, he would in all probability be called upon to occupy, would be done with graceful dignity. Even supposing his family were not as much alive as he was himself to all the advantages to be derived from his union with Miss Wood, once married, as his wife she was sure of an"], [174, "166 THE CARYLLS. affectionate reception at the Holt, which her own virtues and amiable disposition, when known, would justify and confirm. How to dispose of poor Mrs. Wood was a little em barrassing, but this was a question he would settle at his leisure, especially as other matters claimed his more immediate attention. Even Annie herself had the privilege of occupying his mind only at rare and uncertain intervals. For his thoughts were now almost entirely engrossed by Edward's fast approaching de parture, to which he looked forward with a sort of dismay, as involving the loss, not only of a brother whom he loved with a sort of idolatry, but of a friend on whose counsels and assistance he could at all times firmly rely ; a loss which, as the time drew near, he was beginning to appreciate to its full extent. The few days Major Caryll had yet to remain in London were necessarily much taken up with preparations for his voyage, and the numerous visites d adieu that he had to make. It was only at an early breakfast, or late in the evening, that the brothers had much chance of meeting, and even this was un-"], [175, "THE CARYLLS. 167 certain. More than once Walter called at his brother's hotel at an early hour, to be told that the Major had gone out a few minutes before ; more than once he had passed the whole evening in his lodgings alone, waiting in vain for the visitor who never made his appearance ; but Walter was determined to throw away no chance of profiting by the few hours still left ; he resisted every tempta tion which involved a possibility of his being out of the way when his brother called. Still, though unable to visit them, he did not neglect the Woods. On the second day after his last interview he wrote to Mrs. Wood, explaining to her fully how his time was occupied, and entreating her to give him some news of Annie's cold. To this he re- ceived a most satisfactory reply. Annie's cold had disappeared altogether, and her visits to the Museum had been resumed. His own explanations were more than sufficient to account for his absence, and nothing could distress Mrs. Wood more than to suppose, that, on their account, he had neglected a"], [176, "168 THE CARYLLS. brother to whom he was so much attached, and who was so worthy of his attachment. One evening, the Saturday after their arrival, Major Caryll was able to give up entirely to his brother. They dined together at the hotel, and did not separate till late, for they had much to talk over. \" I heard from Maud to-day,\" said Walter, \" and she gives no better account of poor John. She says that she was never so shocked in her life as by the change which a few short weeks have made in his appearance.\" \" No doubt,\" replied his brother, \" the change, which to those who were in the habit of seeing him every day appeared gradual, must have struck her as being very sudden. Dear Maud has been so much occupied with her own concerns for the last six months, that she had no time to notice his gradual decay. She compares him now with what he was a year ago.\" \" You have never told me, Edward, if my father disapproved, or was annoyed by my decision about the living.\""], [177, "169 THE CARYLLS. \" Well, I dare say he had rather have you than a stranger, but he fully admitted your perfect right to judge for yourself. I remem ber his saying to Caroline, who certainly was disappointed by youi refusal, that if he had thought it but reasonable to consult you before he applied for a nomination for you to the Foreign Office, it would be worse than un reasonable now to complain of your sticking to the profession which you had adopted with his concurrence and approbation. Love him, Walter, love him with your whole heart and soul. I know every turn of his mind, and I know him to be the incarnation of justice and honour. We have a long line of ancestors, some of whom have distinguished themselves in various ways, but believe me, our highest claim to hereditary respect rests upon being the sons of such a father.\" \" 1 feel it as you do,\" Walter replied ; \" although of course I have never lived with him on the intimate footing that you have done.

If the son is proud of the father, the father may with equal justice be proud of the son.\" \" And yet,\" said Edward, \" I have some times asked myself of late, if I am acting the part of a son in leaving him in his old age.\" \" My dear Edward, you should remember that in your profession the most extraordinary thing is that you should have been left near him so long, and certainly this he could not have expected when you entered the army. In fact, he has been most particularly fortu nate. Had not your old regiment been wanted in Ireland, you would have been sent to the Crimea, and you were actually under orders to embark, when the news of the peace arrived. And I myself have heard you say that, if a Continental war were to break out, you would exchange into the line.\" \" Yes, all that is true ; but I do not suppose I am what I was. At least, I very much doubf , if six months ago my feelings had been what they are now, I should have accepted a"], [179, "171 THE CARYLLS. majority in India. And yet I am quite con vinced it is the best thing I could do. Indeed,\" he added, in a low voice, as if to himself, \" the only thing that was left for me to do.\" Walter did not quite catch his last words, but he saw that he was unusually depressed. He had noticed the same thing once or twice of late, and it was so unlike his brother's generally cheerful manner, that he was im pressed with the idea that there must be some special cause for it. \" Has anything occurred to vex or annoy you ?\" he asked. \" No ; what makes you think so ? Because I am not a very amusing companion ? How ever, I confess I do feel rather low and out of spirits. The thoughts of parting from you all, I suppose; or because I am getting old ; or poor John's illness. Even Mr. Mark Tapley would find it difficult to be jolly under such circumstances. I wish you could spare me a little of your philosophy, Wat.\" \" I shall want it all for myself, dear Edward, when you go.\" I 2"], [180, "172 THE CARYLLS. \" And then I had not a particularly merry evening at Lucy's last night. She would not ask you, that she might have me all to herself, and a very pretty dish of horrors she served up to me. Bloody-minded Rajahs and trea cherous Thugs, poison and cholera were the mildest ingredients. I believe she thinks that India is inhabited by Red Indians, and ex pects me to come back, if I come back at all, without a scalp to my head. Shoreham began by being amused, but he checked her at last, and told her that she was certainly taking the most effectual means for preventing my going to India by frightening me to death in England. It is but justice to add, as some excuse for her, that Hilda had eaten some thing that disagreed with her, and was per petually complaining, poor little child, of a pain in her belly.\" \" That accounts for Lucy's visions of poison for you, at all events,\" Walter remarked. Major Caryll was silent for a short space. \" After all,\" he said, at length, in a sort of dreamy soliloquy, \" what a contemptible, degenerate race we are in the present day \u2014"], [181, "173 THE CARYLLS. mere pygmies, compared to the mighty men of old ! Here am.

I wonder what that stout old Crusader, Sir Hildebrand Caryll, who looks so fierce and resolute on his monument, would say to such a want of energy on the part of one of his descendants ? In his day, when the champion of the Cross followed his feudal superior to Palestine, it was with every chance against him. When he left his native shore he was in most instances completely cut off from all communication with it. Wife and children might perish without his know ing anything of their fate, till, on his return, he saw their monuments in the neighbouring convent church. For himself, death and captivity, disease and privations dogged his steps at every turn. Even when victorious,"], [182, "174 THE CARYLLS. victory was generally barren, or added to the distress of the victors. But he pursued his career undaunted, sustained by religious faith and the fortitude of a heroic mind. If slain, he participated in the prayers of the universal church, while the admiration and regrets of his brethren-in-arms followed him to the grave. If taken captive, and cast into a damp and loathsome dungeon for ten, fifteen, twenty years, he wrapped himself up in his virtue, and submitted to his fate with patience and resignation ; and if released by some lucky turn in the wheel of fortune, he emerged from his prison with powers of mind and body unimpaired. Perhaps, on reaching his own country, he finds his wife married to his own familiar friend, who, to the exclusion of his offspring, has seized upon his inheritance, and massacred his most faithful retainers. Eoes he sink into despair? Does he take refuge in some obscure abode far from the haunts of men, and pass his time in moaning and whining over his miserable fate ? No ! He hastens home to the cot inhabited by his foster-brother, and with his assistance assem-"], [183, "175 THE CARYLLS. bles the few vassals who yet remain foithful to their lord. At their head he boldly storms the castle, takes the usurper prisoner, and orders him to be forthwith suspended from the battlement. His wife, considerably the worse for wear since he last saw her, throws herself into his arms with sobs, and tears, and protestations of unswerving fidelity of heart, although she acknowledges, with becoming bashfulness that, in other respects, she had been compelled to submit to the exigencies of the times. The baron, with the simplicity of a great mind, gives implicit credence to her words, kisses her, and assures her of his en tire belief in her constancy and truth. Then in turn, he presents to her the Emir's daugh ter, to whom he owes his deliverance, and who accompanied him in his flight. The baroness, with that admirable good sense which characterised the ladies of that period, takes her in her arms, assures her of her never ending gratitude, and confers on her the post of bosom friend and confidant. By common consent, a veil is thrown over the past, and"], [184, "176 THE CA'YLLS. the three live happy ever after in the most intimate and well-assorted union. Et voila7' At this climax, Walter, who had been listening to his brother's rhapsody with amused attention, burst into a fit of laughing. \"Well done, Edward,\" he said; \"in ten minutes you have given me a romance in three volumes. But, notwithstanding the strong minded simplicity of your hero, and the admirable good sense of your heroine, 1 think, on the whole, I prefer the insipid security of these days to the glorious uncer tainty of those.\" \" Do you ? Then let us go back to the nineteenth century. I received a letter from John this morning. He tells me that nego tiations have already been opened with his friend, Mr. Wells, about the living, and that my father has invited him to the Holt, that he may have an opportunity of looking about him, and seeing how the place suits him. I can see John looks upon it as almost a settled thing.\" \" Does he say anything about himself?\""], [185, "177 THE CARYLLS. \" Not a word ; but he tells me there was a sort of hitch in Louisa's marriage, but that it is now smoothed over.\" \" Money, of course,\" suggested Walter. \" Yes, money. It appears that Mr. Ley cester wished Louisa's fortune to be settled absolutely on himself in case of her dying without children, and to this my father would not consent. It was referred by mutual con sent to Lord Isleworth, and wheu he gave it in my father's favour, Leycester submitted with a very good grace.\" \" I wish he had not,\" exclaimed Walter ; \" I wish it had been broken off altogether. Can you fancy a man in love, or pretending to be, speculating on the death of the woman he is going to marry ? \" \" My dear Wat, these matters are left to the lawyers, who, as in duty bound, suggest what they think most advantageous for their client's interests.

What do you mean? \" \"Exactly what I have said, except that the proposal came from him. He takes my three horses off my hands \u2014 that was one of the results of the dinner to which I would not invite you on the night we returned to town. When he came to my stables to look them over, he saw Ph\u0153bus, and recognized him directly.

It is impossible for me to lay myself under such an obligation to a man I hardly know.\" \" That is precisely what I told him, and then he asked me if I had so little regard for him as not to allow him to oblige a brother of mine in such a trifling matter as that? And in truth, it is a trifling matter to him. He has always ten or twelve horses in his stable, and one more, or one less, does not much signify. So what could I do but what I did? I not only accepted myself, but promised to obtain your acceptance also.\" \" I will call on him to-morrow to thank him,\" said Walter. \" Of course it is only till I have the means of paying for his keep myself.\" \" It is for three months, and no more, as I told you. Savage has only taken his stables in London till the first of August. If by that time the living is not sold, you must draw upon my agent for the keep of your horse. I will speak to him about it.\" \" How long am I to go on robbing you !"], [188, "180 THE CARYLLS. But I think you like to be robbed. I hope Sir Henry is to give you a good price for your horses.\" \" My dear Walter, Savage is the best friend I have in the world, out of my own family. If I had said ' Give me a thousand pounds apiece for the three,' he would bave written out a cheque for the amount at once. As it was, I asked six hundred and fifty for them, which is about what they are worth.\" \" Is Sir Henry very rich ? \" \" He has two-and-twenty thousand a-year to do what he likes with.\" \" I hope he will keep it, but his racing expenses must be enormous, and he bets tre mendously, I have heard.\" \" Nothing like what they say,\" replied Edward. \" And he will not involve himself. He has too much good sense for that, and as yet he is a large winner.\" \" Before I go, there is a point on which I wish to consult you,\" said Walter. \" I do not think that I ought during John's life to take anything from the sale of the living, but leave it all to him. What is your opinion ?\""], [189, "181 THE CARYLLS. \" My opinion is that half will be legally and morally yours. However, when it is sold, make him the offer if you like. My word for it he will not accept it.\""], [190, "182 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER IX. The last ten days of Major Caryll's stay in London brought with it various changes. Maud and her husband arrived, accompanied by Louisa Caryll, who had sundry purchases to make on her own account, and to whom Mr. Leycester had confided the delicate task of selecting the drawing-room furniture for their future home at Tuftons. He himself had promised to follow in a week, or ten days. Then came Lady Mary Segrave with Miss Leycester, whom she deposited in safety at the Brentfords' before proceeding to her own house. In John Caryll's precarious state of health anything like gaiety was, of course, out of the question for all connected with him, but Lord Brentford insisted upon keep ing open house for his wife's belongings, and endeavoured to surround her with them as much as possible, as he himself could give"], [191, "183 THE CARYLLS. her but little of his company. At his father's urgent request he had taken his seat on the very evening of his arrival, and, as there hap pened to be two or three questions of con siderable political importance in agitation at the time, for the last two nights he had not been able to return home till a very late hour. His mornings were devoted to a rail way committee of which he was a member, and, as the bill affected the interests of several of his constituents, he was obliged to be very punctual in his attendance. \" I had no idea Parliament was this sort of fun,\" he confided to Mr. Shoreham, who formed one of the family party invited to dine with him on the Wednesday. \" I was always told that the House of Commons was the pleasantest club in London, with its smoking- room and refreshment rooms, and that sort of thing ; where one meets all the fellows one knows ; where one might come when one liked, stay as long as one pleased, and come away when one has had enough of it. But by Jove, I see plainly I shall never again have a moment's peace, My work is worse than"], [192, "184 THE CARYLLS. yours, and, as for a wife, I might just as well be without one ; from eleven in the morning till eleven at night, or later, I shall never catch a glimpse of her. I have sold myself into slavery ; downright slavery ; a galley slave is a free man compared to me.\" \" Luckily,\" said Shoreham, \" it is a slavery from which you can always redeem yourself by giving up your seat.\" \" That is just the devil of it ; I cannot. In the first place, nothing would vex my father more, and that I would not do on any account. But even if I could get over that, Maud would not hear of it for a moment. You have no idea what a politician she is become. Nothing will serve her but my making a speech, though I have explained to her, over and over again, that the most elo quent speeches in the world have hardly ever been known to change a single vote, in fact that they are of no earthly use, except to while away the time, and give fellows a chance of coming in from their clubs and their dinners before the division. But no ; she says I owe it to myself, and my family, and above all to"], [193, "185 THE CARYLLS. my constituents, to prove to them that they have elected a member who is able to defend their interests in case of need, with all sorts of bosh ; where she picked it up I have not an idea. And every morning she pores over the notices of motion to select one for my maiden effort. Thank goodness, as yet she has not found one to her mind.\" Shoreham could not help laughing \" You must not expect this good luck to continue all through the session,\" he said. \" No, I should think not, indeed. I have not said a word about it to her, so don't you, but there is that infernal motion for the repeal of the malt tax coming on, on which I must say something, though what I have not the slightest conception. However, my colleague has promised to cram me, and, as I have a capital memory, I hope I shall not quite make an ass of myself.\" In Lord Brentford's enforced absence Major Caryll took his place at the foot of the table ; he had refused to accept any other invitation, that he might be able to devote his last few days to his own family, and it was an under-"], [194, "186 THE CARYLLS. stood thing that all of his relations, who could manage it, were to meet him at dinner every day. The only person not immediately con nected with the Carylls, who was expected to join them, besides Miss Leycester, who was staying in the house, was Lady Mary Segrave, whose intimacy with them all made her looked upon as almost a member of the family. She was one of the most constant of the guests, but, though to her appertained Edward's arm to take her to the dining-room, their intercourse had undergone a consider able change since the week they had passed together at Oakfield Chase. There he had been her inseparable companion, whileWalter was pursuing his designs on Miss Leycester's Leart and hand. Now, although still on the same friendly terms, she had perhaps rather less of his attention than any one else. Her conversation was chiefly carried on with V alter, or Shoreham, or any of the ladies of the party who happened to be disengaged, while Edward devoted himself to his sisters and Beatrice, who had taken a great fancy for him, to use her own expression, ever since"], [195, "187 THE CARYLLS. their steeple chase. Still, when Lady Mary's carriage was announced, it was always Edward who assisted her with her cloak and escorted her down stairs; his was the last hand she pressed when she took her leave. Beatrice Leycester, who was seldom at any pains to conceal her feelings, did not think it necessary to make any mystery of the pleasure she took in Major Caryll's society, and the regret she felt at his approaching departure. \" So provoking,\" she said one evening, \" just when I was beginning to like you so much. I am sure we should have been such excellent friends.\" \" What a cruel phrase ! I was in hopes we were excellent friends already.\" \" Of course we are. I meant that we should have become better acquainted with each other.\" Edward smiled. \" I do not think your character requires a long study to enable one to read it,\" he said. \" But yours does,\" she retorted, blushing a little. \" I thought, when I first knew you, that I understood you thoroughly, but now"], [196, "188 THE CARYLLS. there is something that puzzles me, something I cannot quite make out, though what it is I could not say.\" \" If I can be of any use in solving this knotty point \u2014 \" he began. But she interrupted him. \" No, we will keep it as a problem to be solved on your return.\" \" What is it that is to be solved on Edward's return ?\" asked Maud, who had approached them unperceived. \" That is a secret between your brother and me. Un segreto d'importanza. Oh, Louisa, do give us a little music.\" Louisa had a magnificent contralto voice, which she had cultivated with as much diligence and care as was possible for one whose almost constant residence had hitherto been in the country^. Fortunately, the gover ness to whom Lady Caryll had intrusted tbe care of her daughters' education, and who had remained with them for some years after that lady's death, was herself an accomplished musician, and thoroughly versed in the art of instructing others. Consequently, there was"], [197, "THE CARYLLS. 189 no bad style to contend against, no faults to eradicate, and when, on occasion of her pay ing a long visit to her sister Lucy, a few years before, Edward urged her to take lessons regularly from one of the best masters of the day, she yielded to his entreaties, nothing loth, her brother and Shoreham sharing the expense between them. Mr. Leycester, who was very fond of music, and no bad judge, no sooner made the discovery of his intended's proficiency, than he entreated her to lose no opportunity of bringing her talents to perfection. Such a voice, he said, was a gift from heaven, which it would be positively sinful to neglect. But Louisa Caryll needed no such encour agement; her singing gave her quite as much pleasure as it did to others. She complied with Miss Leycester's request at once, and accompanied by Mrs. Shoreham, went through some of her favourite airs, amidst a silence rarely accorded to the most celebrated artists, broken occasionally by a murmured expres sion of applause. When she left the piano, Edward took her in his arms and kissed her."], [198, "190 THE CARYLLS. \" Thank you, Louisa,\" he said. \" Your notes will still ring in my ears when I am far away.\" \" Now, Bee,\" said Lady Mary, \" it is your turn.\" \" My turn indeed ! No thank you \" Do you sing, Beatrice ?\" asked Louisa. \" If so, I put in my claim to hearing you, as what I have a right to insist on.\" \" Do, cousin Beatrice,\" said Edward. \" You cannot refuse me one of the last requests I can make.\" \" Mary, I positively hate you,\" said the young lady thus invoked. \" T certainly do give tongue occasionally, but to call it singing, after what we have just heard, is perfectly ridiculous. Besides my songs are all Eng lish.\" \" And we are all English, so nothing can be more appropriate,\" said Walter. \" Well, I hate making a fuss about nothing, so I will sing. But I warn you, you will be disappointed, and if any one wants to hiss I give him free leave.\" She then began, much to their amusement,"], [199, "191 THE CARYLLS, with \" Come into the garden, Maud,\" and sang a couple of ballads in a small, pure voice, with great good taste and simplicity. \"And now,\" she said, addressing Major Caryll, \" I will sing one more, expressly for you; so say what it shall be?\" He named \" Kathleen Mavourneen,\" and she began at once. When she came to the words, \"It may be for years; it may be for ever;\" words so applicable to the circum stances under which they were assembled, she threw so much pathos and feeling into them, that more than one of those present gave free course to their tears. Edward himself, who was standing close to the piano, could not refrain from casting a glance at Lady Mary, who was seated on a sofa near, with her eyes fixed on the ground. No one noticed it but Miss Leycester, who happened to look towards him at the moment, and who was so much struck by his expression of despairing anguish that, while it startled her, it at once solved the mystery which had puzzled her in Edward's demeanour. When she rose from her seat he had recovered his"], [200, "192 THE CARYLLS. composure, but, to assist him in dispelling any embarrassment of which she had been the involuntary cause, she said \u2014 \" Now, cousin Edward, I think I am entitled to a reward, and the least you can do is to send me the skin of the first tiger you kill yourself. It will be just the thing for my pony carriage.\" \" I promise it you,\" said Edward. \" If you wish it, I will telegraph to have a tiger in readiness for me to shoot on my arrival.\" \" What fun you will have ! I suspect you will find all our sport very tame on your return. Those hog-hunts must be worth going any distance sor. How I wish I could go too ! Do not you think you could contrive to take me out as a cabin-boy ? \" A mingled shout of laughter and reprobation greeted this speech, but Edward answered with becoming gravity, \"Perhaps it might be managed, but I am afraid it would hardly answer your purpose ; for though you might catch a glimpse of Indian shores, you would get no further ; a cabin boy must remain with his ship.\" \" What a bore ! I have a great mind to"], [201, "THE CARYLLS. 193 propose to Brownie an overland journey to India.\" But Beatrice's object was attained. Edward eagerly caught at anything which could dis miss from his mind, if but for a time, the painful thoughts by which it was so constantly occupied. For the rest of the evening the two settled down into a regular flirtation, a good deal to Walter's amazement, and a little to his discontent. It was the first time he had ever seen his brother so completely devoted to any woman, and he watched them with a sort of uneasy curiosity, not only as regarded their present proceedings, but as to what the upshot of them might be. In this there was no jealousy, though there might have been a slight admixture of envy. It could of course be nothing to him, in case Beatrice Leycester altered her views in respect to matrimony, whom she married ; still he felt that it would require a very strong dose of self-command to enable him to give her, as a sister-in-law, the welcome sbe had a right to expect. At length Sunday, the day of parting, came. VOL. II. K"], [202, "194 THE CARYLLS. All Major Caryll's preparations were com pleted, and his berth secured. On the morrow he proposed going down to the Holt, where he meant to pass the rest of the week, and then proceed straight to Southampton, without passing through London again. His adieus must be made that evening, and for this pur pose the whole family met at Lord Brentford's at dinner. Nothing more cheerless or un comfortable than that last meeting can well be imagined, notwithstanding the noble host's endeavours to infuse something like animation into the conversation, in which attempt he was ably but ineffectually seconded by Mr. Shoreham. \" By Jove,\" he said at length, \" to hear us and see us, one would think we were taking leave of Daniel on the eve of his being cast into the lion's den. After all, India is net the bout du monde. I have strong thoughts of going there myself for a few months, and taking Maud with me.

Will you go with us? You will be able to kill a tiger for yourself.\" But the effort was made in vain ; his face tiousness met with no response, nor did it even elicit a rebuke ; it passed unnoticed. The depression, originating with Lucy, speedily became general, and everyone felt that it would be a relief when the last words of farewell were spoken. Lady Mary Segrave was the first to depart ; she had borne up bravely, but she felt that her powers of self possession were deserting her. Lord Brent ford rose to take her to her carriage, but Edward was beforehand with him, and offered her his arm. Not a word was spoken on either side as they descended the stairs together ; but before she left the house, she said \u2014 \" Am I to wish you good-bye now, or shall I see you to-morrow before you leave Lon don ?\" It was an immense temptation. Should he yield, or should he resist? There was not much time for deliberation. k 2"], [204, "196 THE CARYLLS. \" If you can receive me as early as twelve o'clock,\" he replied, \" I will call ou you at that hour punctually, for I have still an odd job or two to execute for my father before I go to the station.\" \" Punctually at twelve I shall expect you. Good night.\" She entered her carriage, and he returned upstairs to go through a fresh and equally painful ordeal. But at last it was over, though it was almost by force that he tore himself from the arms of the sisters who clung around him. \" And good-bye to you, too, cousin Bea trice,'' he said, turning to Miss Leycester. \" Remember we are to be excellent friends when we meet again, and you have solved the problem that puzzles you.\" \" It is solved already,\" she replied, thought lessly. \" What !\" he exclaimed, turning very pale. \" What do you mean ?\" \" Nothing ; I was only joking. Good-bye, cousin Edward. No one wishes you a happy and prosperous career more sincerely than I"], [205, "197 THE CARYLLS. do. I trust there are many steeplechases yet in store for us to ride together.\" Walter accompanied his brother home. \" I would come too,\" said Lord Brentfordi as he shooks hands with them, \" but I do not like to leave Maud.\" \" No, no. You are right ; stay with your wife. Good-bye and God bless you, dear Brentford. Do not forget to look after my father,\" were Major Caryll's last words to his brother-in-law. \" And now, Edward,\" said Walter, as they were walking homewards, \" tell me all you wish me to do for you.\" \" I think we have settled everything that was to be settled,\" his brother replied. \" I leave my servant in town to get together and pack up what has not yet been sent in of my outfit, and I depend upon you for seeing that he starts in proper time with all my goods and chattels for Southampton.\" \" Make yourself quite easy about that; I mean to meet you at Southampton myself, and will bring him and your luggage with me. Anything else ?\""], [206, "198 THE CARYLLS. \" Thanks, dear Wat. It will be a comfort to me to have you with me to the last. And, if you can conveniently manage it, I wish you would meet me at the station to-morrow, in case I should have forgotten anything. I shall start by the four o'clock train. You might call at the hotel and bring my port manteau with you.\" \" All right. Anything else ?\" \" Nothing ; and as we are at your own door, I will leave you. A demain.\" Major Caryll was early on foot on the fol lowing morning. He had still several of those trifling things to do which invariably crop up at the last moment ; but his thoughts were entirely engrossed by his approaching interview with Lady Mary Segrave, and, it must be confessed, not pleasantly. \" What a fool I was,\" he muttered to him self, \" to consent to it ! Last night, in the darkness, and the hurry of handing her to her carriage, I could have said farewell without the fear of betraying my feelings. Now I must undergo half an hour's agony at least, which, with a little more forethought, I"], [207, "199 THE CARYLLS. might have been spared. If it would not look like downright incivility, I should be tempted to take leave of her by letter, and plead as an excuse some piece of urgent business, which has unexpectedly started up. But that is out of the question. She seemed by her manner to wish to see me again, and it would be a poor return to make for all her kindness, if I were to disappoint her now. After all, if I have kept my secret for so many months, the deuce is in it if I cannot keep it an hour longer. She shall never have cause to suspect that, for the second time, I am the victim of her indifference. I wonder what Beatrice Leycester could have meant by saying that my problem was already solved? Is it possible that she can have a suspicion of the truth!\" He was still occupied with an investigation of this delicate question, when he found him self at Lady Mary's door, and in another minute in her presence. \"Punctuality itself ! \" she exclaimed, with assumed cheerfulness, pointing to the clock, which was in the act of striking twelve."], [208, "200 THE CARYLLS. \" One of my few redeeming qualities,\" he replied. \" But I can assume no merit in being punctual to an appointment with which a lady has condescended to honour me.\" As a barrier against any expansion of feel ing, he adopted a cold and formal courtesy of tone and manner which sat on him but awk wardly, and which only served to embarrass them both. He sat down on a chair near the sofa on which Lady Mary was seated, and then en sued one of those well-bred, trivial conver sations, to which people have recourse when their thoughts are engrossed by other sub jects. It had principally reference to the friends they had met on the preceding even ing, and by degrees assumed a graver tone. \" Tell me, Lady Mary,\" said Edward, \" what are Louisa's chances of happiness with John Leycester. I hardly know if it is a fair question, but it is one that gives me great anxiety, and I am sure you will pardon me for putting it.\" After a moment's pause, she replied \u2014 \" If Louisa were very much in love with"], [209, "201 THE CARYLLS. my cousin John, and placed her hopes of happiness solely in the domestic pleasures of a home, I fear she would be disappointed. But I do not think this is quite the case ;_ Louisa looks forward to something more brilliant. With Mr. Leycester's fortune, and his and her connections, she will find herself at once in a very good position, and this will gratify her. But this may be only the begin ning of her greatness. Mr. Leycester assures me that he is certain of a seat in Parliament within a year. Someone, he did not say who, is to make room for him, by retiring at the end of the session. He has really very great abilities, great perseverance, great determina tion, and, if he is but true to himself, I have no doubt of his success. Louisa will be quite in her proper place as the wife of a leading statesman. For the rest, if not a devoted, I have no doubt of his making her an atten tive husband. He professes a great respect for public opinion, which will, no doubt, increase when once embarked on public life.\" K 5"], [210, "202 THE CARYLLS. \" And with that she must be content,\" said Edward. \"Poor girl, I hope she may never repent the lot she has made for herself. But what did you mean by saying, ' if he is true to himself?' \" \" John is rather fond of crooked ways, and perhaps might not be very scrupulous as to the means he might employ for his advance ment. And this, I have remarked, in the long run seldom answers ; in these days at least. Of course you will consider wdiat I have now said as strictly confidential.\" \" Of course. And now, dear Lady Mary, I fear I must take my leave of you.\" He rose as he spoke, and she did the same. \" I suppose,\" she said, hesitatingly, \" with so many members of your own family to write to, it is quite useless to ask for an occa sional letter.\" \" On the contrary,\" he exclaimed, with more animation than he had hitherto shown ; \" on the contrary, one of my greatest plea sures will be in hearing from home. For if you allow me to write to you I shall naturally expect an answer.\""], [211, "203 THE CARYLLS. \" Certainly ; and be very sure you take with you my best wishes for your happiness and prosperity.\" \" Thank you, thank you,\" he cried. \" God bless you, dear Lady Mary. Farewell.\" The door closed on him ; the last struggle was over ; the secret of each was still un known to the other, and two loving hearts were parted for want of a word, a look, a sigh, which would have been sufficient to unite them for ever."], [212, "204 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER X. In her agitation Lady Mary had omitted to ring the bell for the servant to open the door for her visitor, and while Edward was in the act of letting himself out he discovered that he had left one of his gloves in the drawing room. With a muttered imprecation on his carelessness he rushed upstairs three at a time, and opening the door \u2014 \" I beg your pardon,\" he said, \" I have left\u2014\" But before he could complete his sentence he was thunderstruck by seeing Lady Mary lying on the sofa in an agony of tears, with her head buried in the cushions. \" Good God, Lady Mary,\" he exclaimed, \" What is the matter? What has happened?\" She had not noticed his entrance, but at the sound of his voice she started up with a cry of affright."], [213, "205 THE CARYLLS. \" Edward, come back ! What is it you want ?\" \" Want !\" he said, half stupefied by what he saw. \" What is the meaning of these tears ?\" \" Nothing, nothing ; there is nothing the matter. Leave me now, I entreat you. For mercy's sake leave me to myself.\" But by that time he had caught a glimpse of the truant glove, pressed in her hands and wet with her tears. The truth flashed upon him at once, and, instead of obeying her in junctions to leave her, he threw himself on his knees beside her. \" No, no,\" he cried, \" I cannot, I will not go till I know the meaning of those tears. Tell me, I conjure you, if I have any share in them ; if the love which I have so long, so painfully concealed, dare hope for any re turn, or will you send me from you in de spair, without one kindly word to cheer me in my exile?\" \"Despair!\" she replied. \"Oh, no; but it is impossible you can feel anything but con tempt for one who has proved herself so"], [214, "206 THE CARYLLS. utterly uuworthy of the love you may have once felt for her/\" \" Mary, the love I felt for you in my boy hood, the love I felt for you in my youth, has never ceased to fill my heart.

Even at the risk of your displeasure I must avow it, for on it depends the whole happiness or misery of my future existence. Tell me, then, if I may venture to hope, but before you reply remember that my fate is in your hands.\" Already, after a weak and ineffectual struggle on her part, he had possessed himself of her hand ; at his last words her head sank upon his shoulder, but a sob was the only an swer he obtained. \" Mary,\" he continued, as if determined to bring matters to a crisis, \" I am going to India ; from that there is no escape. Will you go with me as my wife ?\" \" Ah !'' she cried, with all the honesty of her woman's heart, \" to the end of the world, and bless you on my knees for the boon.\""], [215, "207 THE CARYLLS. A few minutes were given up to the feel ings of unutterable happiness which filled the hearts of both, when, in the midst of his transports, Edward fortunately called to mind that there was a vast deal to be done, and very little time to do it in. But with his clear head he soon saw his way. \" Of course,\" he said, \" I must alter my plans. The voyage by the Cape must be given up. We will go by the overland route, and this will give us at least a couple of months longer in England.\" \" Are you sure they will allow you to put off your departure so long?\" \" Oh, I do not anticipate the slightest diffi culty ; as long as I am at my post by the middle of September, that is all that is re quired of me. However, I shall call at the Horse Guards, and signify my intention.\" \" But, dear Edward, if they ask why, what will you say ?\" \" Urgent private business, dearest ; though 1 do not see why I should not tell the whole truth.

But how I wish I was out of London. How I should like to pass the next two months at the Chase!\" \"Write to Lord Isleworth, and tell him so this afternoon, as soon as I am gone, and you will receive an invitation by return of post.\" \" I think I will ; but Edward, you are not going to leave me yet?\" \" In half-an-hour, my love.

I should be obliged to go to-morrow, for I must have a long talk with my father about settlements, and so forth, which cannot be done by letter ; besides, I think it but right to give him the very earliest intelligence of what we have settled.\" \" Yes, yes, you are right.

And how long do you think you will be absent ?\" \" I propose going down this afternoon, and shall return by the first train to-morrow. You may expect me here much about this hour.\" \" I was to have dined with Maud to-day, but I shall send an excuse. I do not feel equal to it.\" \" Take my advice, dearest ; drive down to Kensington, ask Lucy to give you a quiet dinner, and tell her all how and about it.

Besides, it will save you the embarrass ment of having to tell your own story, when you do meet.\" \" Good Heavens !\" she exclaimed ; \" I shall have to write to aunt Bab.\" \" Of course you must ; pray give her my tenderest love. And now I must be off, or I shall be too late. You will not refuse me one kiss before I go.\" That favour was granted, and a very long kiss it was. \" Thank God,\" he exclaimed, \" it is not farewell I have to say now, but au revoir.\" The door closed on him, but was re opened before he had gone a step. \" Perhaps, Mary,\" he said, \" you will not novv object to return me my representative.\" \" Your representative ! What is your re presentative ?\""], [219, "211 THE CARYLLS. \" My glove ; the loss of which brought me back to your presence, and to which I am indebted for every particle of my present happiness.\" \" Was it, indeed, for your glove that you came back? Let me keep it, then, as a relic, as a memorial of this day.\" \" Lady, to hear is to obey. And now once more, God bless you.\" Edward Caryll found his brother at the station, pacing up and down, and recreating himself as usual with the blissful idea of a speedy visit to Seymour Place. It was not till the Major touched him ou the shoulder that he roused himself from his reverie. \" Master Wat, have you any thoughts of marrying?\" were the first words that greeted his ear. Walter imagined for a moment that, by some occult process, his brother had become acquainted with his most secret thoughts. \" Marrying !\" he said, colouring. \" Of course not. What made you ask such a question ?\" \" Because if you have, and mean to be"], [220, "212 THE CARYLLS. married before me, you must look sharp about it. Since we parted I have wooed and won a bride.\" Walter eyed him with such a scared look, as if he thought that he had taken leave of his senses, that Edward could not refrain from laughing. At that moment he was easily moved to mirth. \"Yes,\" he repeated; \"wooed and won a bride. Is there anything so astonishing in that, that you look so dumbfounded. It is the commonest thing in the world ; occurs every day, and many times a day.\" Walter at last awoke to the perception that his brother was still of sound intellect, and moreover quite serious. \" Beatrice Leycester, of course,\" he gasped out. \" I am Miss Beatrice Leycester's sincere admirer and very humble servant, but I am not her suitor. But to keep you no longer in the dark, go and ask Mary, your future sister in-law, and she will tell you all about it.\" \" Mary ! Lady Mary Segrave !\" \" Well, I believe that is her present de-"], [221, "213 THE CARYLLS. nomination, but I hope in a few weeks she will exchange it for that of Lady Mary Caryll.\" \"Edward, dear Edward,\" exclaimed his brother, grasping his hand, \" I cannot tell you how delighted I am. I congratulate you most sincerely ; congratulate both, for I do not know anywhere two people better suited to each other.\" \" Thank you ; thank you in her name and mine. I toll her you would all greet her as a sister.\" \" And as soon as you are off I will go and tell her so myself.\" \" You will not find her. She is gone to dine and pass the evening at Lucy's. You may tell the Brentfords Jand Louisa, but we do not wish to make it public till she can get out of town, which she will probably do in a day or two. I mean to return to-morrow, and we can talk it over then.\" The bell rang, and Major Caryll took his place in the train. It had already started when he saw his brother running down the platform."], [222, "214 THE CARYLLS. \" How about India ?\" shouted Walter. \" We start in two months by Marseilles and Egypt,\" returned the Major, making a speak ing-trumpet of his two hands.. That Lucy Shoreham's joy at the intelli gence which Lady Mary came to impart was great may well be imagined; tears and smiles followed each other in rapid succession. But perhaps the effect produced amongst the guests at Lord Brentford's was still more marked. To his lordship's infinite satisfaction the house had been counted out at a very early hour, and thus he was enabled to take his proper place at his own dinner-table. When Walter arrived he found him pacing up and down the drawing-room in a state of slight discom posure. \" Have you seen Mary to-day ?\" were the first words he addressed to the coming guest. \" Maud had a note from her an hour ago, saying she has a headache. Such a bore ! To lose Edward is bad enough, and now Mary deserts us.\" Walter had made up his mind to say noth ing of his brother's engagement till after"], [223, "215 THE CARYLLS. dinner. He merely replied that he had not seen Lady Mary, his afternoon having been devoted to Edward. \" How was he ?\" asked Lady Brentford ; \"did he seem to be in tolerable spirits ?\" \" Yes, I think so. He got through a great deal of work this morning, and that I fancy fully occupied his thoughts.\" \" Besides,\" said Louisa, \" he was going to the Holt, and the thought of seeing my father was sure to cheer him.\" \" But it is only to take leave of him,\" ob served Beatrice. Dinner was announced and dispatched. As soon as the servants had left the room Walter thought that the proper time bad arrived for making his disclosure. \" Ladies and my Lord,\" he said, \" I have an important piece of news to communicate, and as I am a poor man I wish to make money of it. I will bet each of you indi vidually three half-crowns to one that you do not guess it. Who will say done first ?\" \"Oh! out with it,\" said Lord Brentford. \" I never could guess in my life, but if it is"], [224, "216 THE CARYLLS. worth hearing I will pay half a crown for it without the trouble of making a bet about it.\" \" Your lordship insults me by affecting to throw a doubt on the value of the article I have to dispose of. You must accept the terms I have proposed, or my mouth is closed.\" \" All right; have it your own way.\" \" But you ought to tell us,\" said Maud, \" if it is good or bad.\" \" Good. And beyond that I will give you no further clue. Qo,faites votrejeu, Mesdames.\" \" Now, Walter,\" said Beatrice, \" I will not take your odds, but I will bet you half-a-crown flat that I guess your news. You shall have a chance of winning back the half-crown you lost on the steeple-chase.\" \" Very well ; but you will lose, I warn you. How shall we manage ? \" \" We will all write our guesses on a piece of paper, and, when you have told us your secret, anyone claiming to win must show what she has written.\" \" And if she refuses to show it,\" said Walter, \" it will be held as an acknowledgment that she has lost. Does that suit you all ? \""], [225, "217 THE CARYLLS. They all assented, and then there was a general cry for paper and pencil. The last was produced by Beatrice, who was always prepared for every emergency, and the paper was easily procured. \" I suppose,\" said Lord Brentford, \" I may write down two solutions, if I like.\" \" As many as you please,\" Walter replied, \" betting half-a-crown on each.\" \" Of course.\" \" My dear Brentford,\" exclaimed Beatrice, \" how can you be so absurd ? You must lose one of them, and most likely both. It is betting two to nothing.\" \" Thank you, Miss Beatrice,\" said Walter, laughing, \" for spoiling my market. Now, are you all ready? \" \" Yes, all. Now let us hear this wonderful piece of news.\" \" Major Caryll, of the 30th Hussars, has proposed to, and been accepted by, Lady Mary Segrave, of Park-street, in the parish of St. George's. My lord and ladies, may I trouble you for your half-crowns.\" VOL. II. L"], [226, "218 THE CARYLLS. \" By Jove, you don't say so,\" said Lord Brentford, taking out his purse. \" I am delighted, though it certainly is the last thing I should have thought of.\" \" Yes, indeed, I should never have guessed it,\" observed Maud; \"and I hardly know now whether my pleasure or surprise is the greatest. Brentford, give me half-a-crown for Walter, will you.\" \" And there is mine,\" said Louisa. \" I would have paid a hundred half-crowns for such news with pleasure. Of course, Edward gives up India.\" \" No, I am sorry to say ; but it is put off for a couple of months. Lady Mary goes with him overland. Perhaps, Miss Leycester, you will permit me to observe that you have not yet shelled out, and as I have a large account to make up to-morrow \u2014 \" \" Before you claim me as your debtor,\" interrupted Beatrice, \"perhaps you had better read the contents of my paper.\" She handed it to him, and to his stupefaction he read as follows : \" Edward Caryllis engaged to Mary Segrave.\""], [227, "219 THE CARYLLS. \" How on earth is it possible \u2014 you have seen Lady Mary this afternoon ? \" \" No, on my honour. Indeed, Louisa can vouch for that, for I have not been out of the house, except on a shopping expedition with her, and to the best of my knowledge Mary has not been here.\" \" But how could such an idea have entered your head ? \" Miss Leycester refused to give him an expla nation, and enjoyed her triumph in silence. \" For heaven's sake, Brentford,\" exclaimed Walter, \" order all the brooms to be locked up, or you will be having Beatrice sail off on one of them, some of these nights, through the roof of the house.\" \" So that is the history of Mary's headache, is it?\" said his lordship. \"I have a great mind to go off for her and bring her back with me.\" \" Or shall we all go to her ? \" was Lady Brentford's proposal. \" It would be no use,\" Walter replied ; \"she is passing the evening at Lucy's.\" L 2"], [228, "220 THE CARYLLS. \"Let us all go to Kensington,\" cried Bea trice. \" It will be a capital lark.\" This proposal met with universal applause. Lord Brentford rang the bell. \" The carriage directly,\" he said to the servant who an swered it. \" Though how we shall manage I hardly know ; for we are five, the carriage only holds four with very close packing, and the brougham is, unluckily, at the coach maker's.\" \" Oh, I will go on the box,\" said Walter. \" I will tell you how we can manage it,\" rejoined Beatrice. \" Walter and I will go in a Hansom. I dote upon Hansoms.\" \" I hardly think that will be quite right, my dear Bee. It will look so odd, you and Walter shut up in a Hansom together,\" was Lady Brentford's very proper observation. \"Oh, just this once; and in the dark nobody will see us. Besides, you will be close behind us to chaperon us. There can be no harm in it, can there, Brentford?\" \" Well, no, I don't suppose there can just for once, and under the circumstances. And if you put on a veil, as you say, nobody will"], [229, "THE CARYLLS. 221 see yon. If Walter loses his character it does not much matter ; but, Bee, if I were you, I would exact from him the same promise you did from Sir Edward, that he shall not pro pose to you en route.\" \" Nonsense, Brentford. How can you be so silly !\" retorted the young lady, as she left the room with the others to make ready for the expedition. They started together, the cab in advance, but in one particular Miss Leycester proved a false prophet. They were seen, and precisely by the person whose recognition, of all others, Walter would most have desired to avoid. At Albert Gate the cab was brought to a momentary stand-still by a jam of carts and omnibuses, and there, beneath a lamp, the light of which flared full upon him, he saw Annie Wood, waiting to cross, with her mother a step behind her. He perceived that she saw him, and just as the cab moved on, he raised his hat to her. \" Who was that young lady you bowed to ?\" asked Beatrice. He hesitated for a moment."], [230, "222 THE CARYLLS. \" A young lady with whom I have the honour of being acquainted,\" was the rather ambiguous reply. \" Rather extraordinary, I must say, for a young lady to be walking about the streets of London alone at this hour.\" Walter, piqued quite as much by the tone in which the observation was made as by the words, was on the point of retorting that it was not more extraordinary than for a young lady to be driving about in a Hansom with a young gentleman at this hour ; but he thought better of it. \" Her mother was with her,\" he said. \" I saw no mother,\" replied Miss Leyces ter, drawing herself up into her corner of the cab, and gathering up her gown, as if to save it from contamination. A short and embarrassed silence ensued, which was broken by Walter. \" Beatrice,\" he said, \" I am sure I know your thoughts, and believe me they are unjust. 1 think, having said this, I might stop, expecting, from what you know of me, to be believed upon my word, but I attach too"], [231, "223 THE CARYLLS. much value to your esteem to risk the loss of it upon a point of honour. You shall hear the history of that young lady and her mother.\" \" No, no. I believe you, and do not want to know any more about them,\" she replied, dying with curiosity all the time. \" But in justice to myself and to them I insist upon it.\" He then related to her the story of the Woods, and the extraordinary chance which had led to his renewing his acquaintance with them. When he had concluded, she shook his hand, exclaiming \u2014 \" My dear Walter, forgive me, I did you wrong, but forgive me. I ought to have known you better. And that poor girl ! Is there any way in which I can be of use to her and her mother? \" \" I do not see how you can, at present at all events ; but if ever the case should arrive, you will let me recall them to your recollection.\" \" Of course ; but John Leycester ought to do something for them. Shall I speak to him about it ? Perhaps on the eve of marriage he"], [232, "224 THE CARYLLS. may be a little more open-handed than he usually is.\" \" Mrs. Wood makes such a point of keeping her present position a profound secret from all those whom she knew in the days of her prosperity,\" replied Walter, \" that I do not think she would make any exception in Ley cester's favour ; I was forced upon her by accident. At all events, take no step in the matter till I have consulted her ; and in the meantime keep her secret. I have mentioned it to no living soul but yourself, not even to Edward, to whom I tell everything.\" He had no wish to unlock the door of his fold. \" You may be sure of my silence,\" said Beatrice. Then after a short pause she asked him when his meeting with Miss Wood had occurred. \" Was it before you came to May Bank?\" \"Yes; a few weeks before.\" A very simple answer, but which gave her matter for reflec tion. By this time they had arrived. They got out, and the cab was discharged. Walter's hand was on the bell, but Beatrice stopped"], [233, "225 THE CARYLLS. him. \" Let us wait for Maud and the others ; we will all go in together.\" They had not long to wait. The Brentford carriage drove up a minute after. At the sound of the carriage stopping, and the ring at the bell, Lady Mary Segrave had said, 1 ' My dear Lucy, for heaven's sake say, not at home ; \" consequently, the very neat parlour maid who opened the door, replied to Lord Brentford's enquiries, with the habitual com posure of a London servant, that Mr. and Mrs. Shoreham were both out. \" Out ! \" exclaimed his lordship. \" Where are they gone to ? \" She could not justly say, but believed they were gone to the theatre. \" What is your name? \" \" Sarah, my Lord.\" \" Oh, you know who I am. Then, Miss Sarah, I beg to inform you that if you tell fibs to a lord and a member of parliament, he can have your head cut off and stuck upon Temple Bar, and you are a great deal too pretty for that. So tell me honestly ; Mr. L 5"], [234, "226 THE CARYLLS. and Mrs. Shoreham are upstairs with Lady Mary Segrave ? \" \" If you please, my Lord \u2014 \" \" That will do. I see I am right, and we will announce ourselves. I will go first,\" he said, turning to his companions, \" and do you follow as quietly as possible.\" Arrived at the top of the stairs, he gave a gentle tap at the drawing-room door. \" WTho's that? Come in,\" said Mr. Shore- ham. \" It's only me,\" replied Lord Brentford, in the meekest of voices, and entered the room, followed by the others in succession, repeating the same formula, \" It's only me ; \" till Shore ham exclaimed, as Beatrice made her appear ance, wdth Walter looming in the distance behind her \u2014 ' Wbat ! will tbe line stretch out to th' crack o' Doom? Another yet ? I'll see no more.\" A cry of joyful surprise greeted the new comers, who responded to it with shouts of laughter. \" We were so uneasy about Mary's head-"], [235, "227 THE CARYLLS. ache,\" said Lord Brentford, in explanation, \" that we have come to see if it is any better.\" But Mary had already been taken posses sion of by Maud and Louisa, Beatrice quietly waiting her turn. When the first pleasurable excitement had a little calmed down, Mrs. Shoreham said \u2014 \" Is she not a dear, good creature ; and I will say a fortunate one too, though perhaps I ought not, as Edward is my brother.\" \" Ah,\" rejoined Lady Mary, \"No one can feel that more than I do.\" Amongst the numerous questions asked in rapid succession, one of the first was \u2014 \" What are your plans ?\" \" We have had no time to settle them yet,\" Lady Mary replied. \" But one thing I must impress upon you ; we wish to keep it secret till we have talked matters over a little \u2014 in fact, till I can get out of town.\" \" I suppose I may mention it to Mr. Ley cester,\" said Louisa ; \" he is coming to town to-morrow.\" \" Certainly,\" said Lady Mary. \" Leycester ! of course ; he is one of us"], [236, "228 THE CARYLLS. now,\" observed Lord Brentford. \" And you will all dine with us to-morrow. I will meet Edward at the station myself to tell him so. I want to see how he looks under his new honours.\" The party soon after broke up, Lady Mary offering to take Walter and Miss Leycester back to town with her. \" Ah, do,\" said Lord Brentford ; \" I shall feel much more comfortable. I hope Walter behaved himself, Bee, coming here.\" \" I wish your lordship would learn to be have yourself, as you call it,\" was the young lady's answer."], [237, "229 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER XI. All the necessary arrangements for Major Caryll's marriage with Lady Mary Segrave went on as smoothly as possible, and as rapidly as the inevitable intervention of law yers would permit. It was an union in all respects agreeable to every one in any way connected with the high contracting parties. Mr. Leycester, indeed, when informed of it, not only manifested as much surprise as the rest of the world, but hinted some doubts of its being attended by permanent happiness to the two parties most concerned. \" I think,\" he observed to Louisa, \" that I have heard some rumour of Caryll's having been attached to Mary before she married Segrave, and I have no faith in rechauffe's, either culinary or amatory.\" \" Whatever the case may have been for merly,'' Louisa replied, \"there can be no"], [238, "230 THE CAIYLLS. doubt that their affection is mutual now. In fact, if one thinks of how much Mary gives up to accompany Edward to India, it is im possible to doubt that when she accepted him she did it with her whole heart and soul.\" \" No doubt, as far as her present feelings are concerned ; the only question is, will they last ? Will she never repent her present deci sion? \" I trust not, I trust in God not ; for all Edward's hopes of happiness are now bound up in her ; and I for one see no cause of doubt.\" \" Well, I need not say that I most sincerely hope you may be right. For Mary I have always felt the affection of a brother, and what I know of Edward I like much. He has neither John's dogmatism, nor Walter's flippancy.\" \" Poor John's dogmatism is never likely to offend any one again, and if Walter is flippant, of which I have never seen any signs, I have no doubt he will correct it as he grows older.\" She spoke warmly, for she felt acutely any"], [239, "231 THE CARYLLS. disparaging reflections on those she loved, and occasionally Leycester tried her severely, more especially of late, partly because he felt sure of his conquest, and partly because the love which he really felt for her had a strong tincture of selfishness in it, and any manifes tation of her affection for others, even for members of her own family, irritated and chafed him. On the present occasion, how ever, seeing that she was really annoyed and displeased, he hastened to make his peace. \" My dear Louisa,\" he said, \" believe me, I had totally forgotten John's present state, poor fellow, when I made that allusion to him ; I deeply regret it and entreat you to forgive it ; I was only thinking of him as he was when I first knew him. As for Walter, I have no doubt that what defects he has, he will outgrow. I am quite prepared to like him as well as I do his brother, if he will let me. My most anxious wish is to be upon the best terms with all your relations, who will soon be mine also.\" She held out her hand to him, which he"], [240, "232 THE CARYLLS. kissed ; further than that he had never yet ventured. This conversation took place on occasion of Leycester's first visit to his betrothed after his arrival, on the day following the improvist visit to Kensington. They all met at dinner in Portman Square, and Mr. Leycester's con gratulations to both his cousin and her lover were as warm and hearty as if they had been dictated by Louisa herself. To avoid the comments of the servants, Lord Brentford took clown Lady Mary, while Beatrice fell to the lot of Major Caryll. They might just as well have spared themselves the trouble ; the mighty secret was already known to every servant in the house. At this meeting the plans of both couples were settled. In six weeks it was supposed that all the preparations might be completed, settlements drawn up, and trousseaus pro vided. By that time, Tuftons would be ready to receive its inmates, and there was nothing to prevent Louisa Caryll's being married at the same time as her brother. In the mean-"], [241, "233 THE CARYLLS. time, Lady Mary meant to go to Oakfield for a fortnight or three weeks, supposing Lord Isleworth's answer to her application were a favourable one, of which there was no reason to doubt ; after which she must return to London to set her house in order ; and then return to the Chase, which would be her home during the short remaining period of her independence. Major Caryll's move ments would, as a matter of course, be almost entirely regulated by hers. Louisa meant to remain a month longer with her sister, and then to return home, there to await the con summation of her destiny. \" And, Mary,\" said Beatrice, \" May Bank is quite at your service for your honeymoon. I shall quarter myself at Oakfield.\" \" If it really will not put you to inconveni ence, we will accept your offer for one week with thanks,\" Edward replied. \" The last week of our stay in England we wish to pass at the Holt.\" \" If I were you, Bee,\" said Lord Brent ford, \" I should drop the name of May Bank,"], [242, "234 THE CARYLLS. and substitute for it 'The Temple of Hy- J >> men. \" Or rather,\" she rejoined, \" ' A Refuge for Penitents.' I think I must build something like an oratory, in which the unfortunates may bewail their misfortune at their leisure.\" \" And do not forget, Bee, to impress strongly on Edward's mind that he must behave with proper respect to Mrs. Howe.\" \" No need for that. Major Caryll has the manners and feelings of a gentleman, and would never think of insulting an unprotected female.\" \" \"What do you mean to do with the house in Park Street ?\" asked Mr. Leycester. \" We have not quite determined,\" said Lady Mary, \" but Edward thinks our best plan will be to let it furnished for three years, the term of our absence.\" \" The lease is yours, I believe. Has it long to run ?\" \" Upwards of seventy years ; but we do not wish to part with that.\""], [243, "THE CARYLLS. 235 \" I think it would just suit us. Louisa, what do you say?\" \" I have never seen it in detail,\" that young lady replied, blushing a little at being ap pealed to. \" Then come both of you to luncheon to morrow, and look it over,\" said Lady Mary, \" and make Maud and Beatrice come with you. I had much rather let it to you than to strangers.\" \" How happy they seem,\" said Mrs. Shore ham to her husband on their way home that night. \" If it were not for that horrid India. How I wish Edward could be persuaded to retire altogether.\" \" That is quite out of the question, my love. He could not do it with credit to himself. But there is no such thing in this world as happiness without some drawback, and alto gether I do not think Master Ned is much to be pitied with such a wife as Lady Mary to bear him company.\" \" I was thinking more of their children,\" his wife replied. \" They say the climate of"], [244, "236 THE CARYLLS. India is fatal to English children, and they will be obliged to send them home all by themselves, poor little things.\" '\" Well, they have not come to that yet. It will be time enough to pity the children when they make their appearance.\" Lord Isleworth's answer was, as might have been expected, a most cordial invitation to Lady Mary to come to him as soon as she pleased, and to stay as long as she pleased ; nor did he conceal the pleasure with which he had heard of her approaching marriage, with a man so deserving of her in every way as Edward Caryll. \"My only regret,\" he said, \"is that you should have thought it necessary to wait for my invitation. I was in hopes you looked upon the Chase as your natural home, as it always will be in my day, and as certainly in Brentford's day when I am gone.\" Accordingly, two days later Lady Mary Segrave left London for Oakfield, as the papers took care to inform the public ; and, by a singular coincidence which they omitted"], [245, "THE CARYLLS. 237 to notice, Major Caryll went down by the same train, and in the same carriage with her, to the Holt. Another event occurred, which, though it grieved her, certainly relieved her from con siderable embarrassment. On the second day after her arrival at Oakfield, as she was medi tating on the terms she should employ to in form her aunt, Lady Barbara Oakley, of her engagement, she received a letter from that lady's lawyer, announcing the death of his client, as also that the deceased had be queathed to her niece, the Lady Mary Se grave, the few thousands she had saved. But the most astounding circumstance was, that by the same document she left a valuable dia mond ring to Sir Edward Caryll. \" Poor dear lady,\" said the worthy baronet, when informed of the legacy, \" how kind of her to remember me after so many years.\" The departure of his brother from London left Mr. Walter Caryll at liberty to prosecute his designs upon Seymour Place. Accord ingly, on the very first evening that he found himself free he bent his steps thitherward."], [246, "238 THE CARYLLS. Mrs. Wood was alone in the sitting-room when he entered, and after a decent interval he ventured to ask after her daughter. \" Annie is quite well ; she will be very sorry to have missed you, but she is gone to a juvenile party.\" \" A party! I thought she never went out.\" \" This is the first piece of dissipation, if so it may be called, in which she has indulged. Indeed, she was very reluctant to go, but Mrs. Smith made such a point of it, that she could not well refuse, as two of her little girls come to our school.\" \" And who may Mrs. Smith be ?\" \" Mrs. Smith is the wife of a linen draper, in rather a large way of business, in the Edgware Road.\" \" Oh, Mrs. Wood, how could you allow her to accept such an invitation ? Annie so re fined, so delicately nurtured, to associate with such people.\" \" My dear Mr. Caryll, we have adopted a profession by which we gain a living, and it is of the utmost importance to us to neglect no means of increasing our connection ; least"], [247, "THE CARYLLS. 239 of all could we afford to offend one of our present clients ; and Mrs. Smith, whom you seem to hold so cheap, is one of our best ; she is a very good sort of person in her way, very influential amongst ladies of her own class, and very well disposed to assist us.\" Walter was silent. His aristocratical sensi bilities had received a severe shock. \" And now tell me something about your self,\" continued Mrs. Wood; \"about your brothers and sisters.\" She was anxious to elicit information on the very point on which Walter was anxious to give it ; and, much as he may have regretted Annie's absence, he determined to lose no time in profiting by it. \" With the exception of poor John,\" he said, \"we are a most thriving generation. nothing but marrying and giving in marriage. In the first place, my brother Edward is going to marry Lady Mary Segrave, and means to take her with him to India. In the next, my sister Louisa is engaged to an old acquaintance of yours, my old fellow pupil, John Leycester.\""], [248, "240 THE CARYLLS. \" Indeed ! And when is their marriage to take place ?\" \" The day is not fixed ; but sometime in the course of the next six weeks. They are to be married at the same time as Edward.\" \"Mr. Caryll, will you have some tea?\" said Mrs. Wood, starting up and going to the bell. \" I quite forgot to ask you.\" \"Are you going to have any yourself?\" \" Yes. I had thought of waiting till Annie comes home; but that may not be these two hours, and I cannot wait till then. Bring up the tea-things,\" she said to the maid who answered the bell. \" In that case I shall be delighted to join you. But, dear Mrs. Wood, do tell me some thing about Leycester. He did not remain at Lynburn more than a couple of months after I came to you. I own I did not like him then, nor do I like him more now that I have been seeing so much of him.\" \" It is hardly a fair question. We liked him while he was with us ; but since then we have not seen much of him. Whenever he came to Lynburn for his Cambridge vacations,"], [249, "THE CARYLLS. 241 he used to call upon us. On his father's death he went abroad for a short time, and on his return settled down at Lynburn, when he paid us one or two visits ; but when I lost my poor husband, all intercourse between us ceased. He wrote to me once on that occa sion, it is true ; but, though he was in the country, he did not come near us. Since that time we have lost sight of him completely.\" \" He is a heartless brute ! \" exclaimed Walter. \" I always thought so, and now I am sure of it. I cannot tell you how anxious I am about Louisa ; she is so used to affection.\" Mrs. Wood made no reply, and the subject dropped. A silence of a few minutes ensued, which neither seemed inclined to break. At length Walter roused himself from the reverie into which he had fallen. \" By-the-bye,\" he said, \"we met the other night at Albert Gate. I conclude you and Miss Wood were returning from the Museum.\" \" Yes. I did not notice you ; but Annie told me she saw you in a Hansom cab with a lady \u2014 one of your sisters, I suppose.\" VOL. II. M"], [250, "242 THE CARYLLS. \" It was the night that Edward had an nounced his marriage, and we were on our way to Kensington, where Lady Mary was dining with the Shorehams. Brentford was foUovving in his carriage, which could not hold us all, so we were packed off in a Hansom.\" \" Was it Miss Louisa Caryll who was with you?\" \"Oh, Louisa delights in a Hansom; nothing would tempt her into a four-wheeler when a Hansom is to be had.\" He thought himself bound in honour not to denounce Beatrice Leycester as his com panion, and he could not bring himself to affirm directly that it was Louisa who was with him. With strange obliquity of con science he flattered himself that he had very cleverly evaded Mrs. Wood's question with out telling an untruth, though in point of fact the one assertion was as false as the other would have been, for Louisa Caryll had a decided aversion to hack cabs generally, and to Hansoms in particular. She had more than once, when Beatrice, whose predilection for"], [251, "243 THE CARYLLS. them was well known, was out of hearing, expressed her astonishment that any lady could enter one. \" They are only fit for stockbrokers and attorneys,\" she said upon one occasion. Walter, who was perfectly satisfied with having once repulsed Mrs. Wood's attack, and had no wish to be forced in his entrench ments by any renewed assault, hastened to change the subject. \" I am sure, my dear Mrs. Wood,\" he said, \" that I need not tell you what deep pain it gives me to see you and your daughter reduced to your present position. Tell me truly, is there any way in which I can be of use to you?\" \" I fear not. I am most grateful to you for your sympathy, but your friends and ac quaintance belong to a totally different class from that with which we are at present con nected.\" \" But why not try a school on a higher scale?\" \" For many reasons ; to do so efficiently m 2"], [252, "244 THE CARYLLS. would require a greater capital than we could command ; without a very large connection we should be crushed by competition ; and, in truth, we are not competent to undertake it. At present we do what we profess to do, and our employers are satisfied.\" \" But it cannot be your intention that Annie \u2014 that Miss Wood should pass her life in this drudgery. You must have formed some plan for the future.\" \" I have thought of plans for the future, no doubt. I hope Annie will be qualified ere long to take the place of a governess. She has made great progress in her drawing, and for the last fortnight has been taking lessons in music and singing, which latterly she has been obliged to neglect, though she tells me that she does not think she has lost much ground.\" \"For her musical talent,\" said Walter, \" she may refer to me. Do you remember the singing lessons she used to give me ? But if she obtains a situation as governess, what would become of you ?\" \" While I live she will not leave me. Ah,"], [253, "245 THE CARYLLS. Walter, it is the thought of what will become of her, when it pleases God to take me, that occupies my mind night and day ; to think that I leave my daughter unfriended and alone.\" \" No, no, dear Mrs. W6od, not unfriended. Though I may not be able to do much for her myself, believe me, for my sake my sisters will do their utmost to befriend her, and further her views. But the event you allude to is, I trust, far distant.\" \" Who knows ? who can tell ? But your words have spoken comfort to me. May God bless you for your kindness to us both.'' Walter did not remain much longer. \" I shall repeat my visit before long,\" he said, on departing, \"and hope to be more fortunate in finding Miss Wood at home.\" Fortune had not quite deserted him, for as he opened the door he met Annie herself, escorted by a young man who was in the act of inserting the latch-key. Her companion took his leave at once, and Walter expressed his hopes that she had had a pleasant evening. If he had dared, he would have made some"], [254, "246 THE CARYLLS. enquiry respecting the happy individual who had been permitted to see her to her own house. His curiosity was speedily gratified. \" Yes ; pleasanter than I expected, and young Mr. Smith was good enough to take care of me home. But I must say good-night, for I know my mother is waiting for me.\" He had half hoped to be invited to go up stairs with her, if but for five minutes, but of this she gave no sign. He returned her good night, closed the door, and walked off; his great consolation being that young Mr. Smith, the linendraper's son and heir, had not been more favoured than himself. \" Well, mother,\" were Annie's first words, as she entered the sitting-room. \" My child, my Annie, would to God I could spare you this blow, but \u2014 \" \"It is true, then?\" \" It is indeed but too true. But if this hope is gone \u2014 \" \" Yes, I know,\" replied Miss Wood, who had sunk into a chair while her mother was speak ing, but now started up. \" Good-night, mother,\" she continued, preparing to leave the room."], [255, "247 THE CARYLLS. \" Ob, Annie, you will not leave me thus.\" \" Oh, forgive me, mother,\" exclaimed Miss Wood, turning back, and kissing her passion ately, while she herself burst into an agony of tears. \" Darling mother, best, kindest \u2014 forgive me all the unhappiness I cause you. I thought I had been fully prepared. And now let me go. I want to be alone ; and when you come to bed, whether I am awake or asleep, please do not speak to me, and never let this subject be mentioned between us again. While I was yet in doubt you saw nothing but my weakness ; I must now strive to regain iny courage.\" And to all appearance she succeeded. When two nights later, Mr. Walter Caryll, in re demption of his promise, again made his appearance in Seymour Place, he found her at the pianoforte practising a very difficult piece of music, with an amount of energy and attention which seemed to indicate that her whole thoughts were concentrated on what she was about. She merely nodded to Walter when he entered the room, and did not rise from her stool till she had executed,"], [256, "248 THE CARYLLS. to her perfect satisfaction, her self-imposed task. \" What do you think of that, Mr. Caryll ? \" she said. \" You used to be a judge of music.\" \" I think you ended by playing it in most masterly style ; but, I confess honestly, I do not much admire such learned music; I sup pose because I am no musician.\" \" Nor do I, perhaps. Mais que voulez vous ? c'est mon metier. My poverty, and not my will, consents.\" She addressed him in such an easy, familiar tone, so unlike her usual reserved manner, that Walter was a little taken by surprise. He noticed too, with something like uneasiness, a hectic flush on her cheeks, and he thought that her voice had acquired a hardness not natural to it. Altogether, it struck him that she was labouring under some excitement, the cause of wdiich he naturally could not divine. To divert her thoughts he asked her about her evening party. \" Well, really,\" she said, \" I have been at many more disagreeable parties. The com pany had not much refinement of manner,"], [257, "249 THE CARYLLS. perhaps, but they had what is far better, that natural politeness which springs from good ness of heart. Almost all our children were there with their parents, and not once was I made to feel that I was their inferior, their paid servant. On the contrary, I think I was treated with more distinction than anyone else. At least Mr. Smith plre gave me his arm to take me in to supper.\" \" And Mr. Smith fils gave you his arm to bring you home.\" \" Precisely ; and that at his mother's sug- gestion.\" \"And how did you amuse yourselves? \" \" Oh, there was a magic lantern and con juring tricks, with a good deal of romping for the children, and cake enough to make them sick for a week. Then came our turn to dance and sup, and one great merit in my eyes is that it was all over by ten o'clock.\" \" I hope you will procure me an invitation to their next party.\" \" That you may laugh at them and turn them into ridicule. No, thank you.\" m 5"], [258, "250 THE CARYLLS. \" My dear Miss Wood, believe me I should be the last person in the world to turn into ridicule anyone who treats you with kindness and respect.\" \" I do believe you. Mother, shall I see why they will not give us tea?\" She left the room as she spoke, and Walter observed to her mother \u2014 \" How animated Miss Wood seems to be to night.\" \" I suppose,\" Mrs. Wood replied, with a sigh, \"it is the necessity of exertion and your presence combined which have roused her, for she has been in a state of great depression all the morning, poor child. I am glad you looked in upon us this evening, for it cheers us both to see an old friend, with whom we need be under no restraint.\" \" It struck me,\" said Walter, \" that her high spirits were not quite natural ; but I trust there was no particular cause for her depression.\" \" Oh, no ; but it comes over her at times \u2014 over both of us, indeed. But we fight against it as well as we can.\""], [259, "251 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER XII. Encouraged by Mrs. Wood's assurance that his visits to them had a cheering effect, Walter repeated the experiment two nights afterwards, aad before Major Caryll's return to town it seemed to be an understood thing that every alternate night he was expected as a guest at the tea table in Seymour Place. Even his brother's presence in London made no differ- ence in this respect; Edward himself was too much engrossed by his duties to his fiancee, who had returned at the same time, to take much notice of Walter's comings and goings. The Major passed every evening, unless they had some engagement common to them both, at Lady Mary Segrave's, with whom Beatrice Leycester was now staying as a sort of chap erone, and most of his mornings were devoted to her service in some way or other. More over Mr. Walter was growing cunning, one of"], [260, "252 THE CARYLLS. the surest symptoms of a man's being in love. He frequently breakfasted at his brother's, and he divided the evenings on which he was free with the most praiseworthy impartiality be tween Portman Square, Park Street, and Kensington. He even found time occasion ally to join his sisters and Beatrice in their afternoon rides under the protection of Lord Brentford, when he could manage it, or of Mr. Leycester, when his lordship's parlia mentary duties detained him elsewhere. With the last-named gentleman Walter found it no easy task to preserve the sem blance of amity. His unfeeling conduct to the Woods at the time of their great affliction was the reason he assigned to himself for this renewed feeling of dislike ; but in reality it was not so. On the contrary, he derived pleasure from the thought that if Annie had ever felt anything like predilection for Ley cester, he had taken the most effectual means of extinguishing it, and that she must now see him in his true colours. It was rather Ley cester's supercilious conduct, which he had for a time laid aside, but which he had of"], [261, "THE CARYLLS. 253 late resumed, which excited Walter's wrath. Leycester treated him like a boy, whose for wardness required to be repressed, seldom condescending to reply to his observations, except to make them the subject of ridicule. And what made it still more provoking was that this insidious system of warfare was carried on in the most good-humoured way possible, with every indication of good-will for the victim. The Brentfords and Louisa were completely deceived, while Major Caryll and Lady Mary were too busily occupied with their own con* cerns to pay much attention to those of others. Leycester, an experienced athlete in this sort of contest, took very good care not to push matters to extremity, and his adversary imi tated his caution ; for Walter felt that seri ously to resent what everybody else treated as a joke would expose him to the charge of captiousness and ill-breeding. Though chaf ing inwardly, he carefully suppressed all outward appearance of animosity towards one who was soon to be so closely connected"], [262, "254 THE CARYLLS. with him. But there was no love lost between them. Of all the party, Beatrice was the only one who was not deceived by these appearances, and in her Walter found a valuable ally and councillor. \" Bear it, Walter,\" she said, on one occa sion, when his patience had been more severely tried than usual, \" bear it ; if you show any irritation, it will give him an addi tional triumph ; and if it is any consolation to you, rest assured that nothing can annoy him more than to find that he fails in disturb ing your equanimity. Imitate me ; more than once I should have liked to take up the cudgels on your behalf, and given him a good set down, but I refrained for Louisa's sake.\" She had naturally enquired if he had sounded Mrs. Wood as to any application to be made to her cousin, and Walter as natur ally had told her every word that had passed between him and his old friend, not without a commentary of his own."], [263, "255 THE CARYLLS. \"Just like him,\" said Beatrice; \"how could your sister accept him ! And yet I hardly wonder at it, for he is clever, and very agreeable when he chooses to take the trouble, and he is certainly good-looking. It is that intense love of self that mars all his good qualities.\" \" If he has any to mar,\" muttered out Walter. \" Do you know,\" continued Miss Leycester, without heeding his ejaculation, \" I have often noticed the different results of selfish ness in man and woman. A selfish man \u2014 I mean one utterly and incurably selfish \u2014 sacri fices everybody : wife, children, brothers, sisters, friends, to his ruling passion, but a selfish woman generally includes husband and family in the aspirations of her self-love. It may not make her more agreeable, but most assuredly it makes her more amiable. But why this difference between us ?\" \" I suppose because in women selfishness never, or but rarely, attains that intense de velopment which it does in us. In other words, because in the qualities of the heart"], [264, "256 THE CARYLLS. you are better than us. And you, Beatrice, best of all,\" he added, after a short pause. \" Walter !\" she said, half in surprise, half in displeasure. \" Oh, I know what I am saying. In my estimation you are placed so far above me that you cannot be offended by my words. I now feel most truly that it was presumption in me to aspire to anything more than your friendship. I was blind \u2014 blinded by vanity and self-love.\" \" My dear Walter, have you taken leave of your senses? For I cannot believe that you would make me an object of mockery.\" \" My dear Beatrice, I am quite in my senses. I have long wished to tell you that the love I once was mad enough to entertain for you has subsided into feelings of the most affectionate friendship and regard. I look up to you with respectful admiration as to a being of a superior order. And having said this, I will only add that you will never again hear from me one word that can distress or annoy you.\" Beatrice hardly knew what answer to make to this extraordinary speech. That he was"], [265, "257 THE CARYLLS. thoroughly in earnest was evident. That he was perfectly sane and perfectly sober there could be no doubt ; nor did she like to treat as a jest what she felt certain were the out pourings of his heart. \" I must have more vanity than falls to my share,\" she replied, \"if I could really believe that I have all the perfection you attribute to me. But though I distrustyour exaggerations in that respect, I feel convinced that there is no exaggeration in your professions of friendship and regard. I need not say that they are warmly returned, but I trust our friendship is fixed on too firm a basis to require any fresh assurance of its existence. And now to go back to your protegees, the Woods ; is there anything to be done for them ?\" \" Nothing, I should say, at present. Per haps when Miss Wood looks out for the situ ation of a governess \u2014 \" \" Very well. Whenever you think I can be of any use you will let me know. In the mean time, if they receive any hampers from May Bank, do not betray me.\" It is astonishing with what a calm con-"], [266, "258 THE CARYLLS. science Walter Caryll rested his head upon his pillow that night. Hitherto he had been suffering from a sort of uneasy sensation, as if, in withdrawing from Miss Leycester, with out warning, the love which had once been hers, he was guilty of treachery. True she had rejected it, but in such matters it is al ways desirable to have the road smooth be fore one. Now there could be no mistake ; he had in explicit terms renounced his al legiance, and he was free to transfer it else where. He almost blushed when he recol lected the extravagant terms in which he had addressed his quondam love, but he did not repent it. He had spoken strongly, for he had felt strongly. He was perfectly sincere in all he had said. His words were the result of honest excitement, and the emotion under which he had laboured at the time. The emancipation which he had achieved was not without its effect upon his inter course with Annie Wood. lTnconsciously, perhaps, he slid into a tenderer tone when he addressed her, not unmarked by her mother, though Annie herself gave no indication that"], [267, "259 THE CARYLLS. she was aware of the change ; still less did she respond to it. It is true the shyness, in a great measure generated by pride, which she had manifested on the first renewal of their acquaintance, had vanished ; their present in timacy had gradually revived the familiar habits of their Lynburn life. He frequently addressed her as Annie, without any sign of displeasure on her part. But there it stopped. To his great annoyance she had never called him by his Christian name ; and more than once she had used expressions which seemed intended to remind him that they no longer belonged to the same class of society; that if she had once been entitled to consider herself as his equal, that was the case no longer. Changes were at hand. The month of July was well advanced, and the day named for the celebration of the double wedding was fast approaching. It was to take place at Oakfield, and John Caryll, notwithstanding his disease had made fearful progress, insisted upon performing the ceremony, assisted by his friend, Mr. Wells. The sale of the living"], [268, "260 THE CARYLLS. had been completed, and that gentleman was now installed at Dr. Cox's parsonage, his present curate and future successor. The whole party left London together, with the exception of Mr. Leycester, who preceded them by a few days, and Mr. Shore ham, who could only promise to attend on the actual day of the wedding. They travelled in a saloon-carriage, which had been provided sor them by Lord Brentford's care, and a very merry party they were. The two brides expectant, indeed, did not join much in the general mirth, but they were the ouly exceptions. The rest were all in the highest spirits, Edward Caryll especially, who indulged during the whole journey in a flow of wit and nonsense which astonished Walter, who now for the first time became acquainted with this phase in his brother's character. Lady Mary had shown some reluctance to go down in the same carriage with her be trothed husband, now that their engagement was public ; she could not quite reconcile it with her sense of decorum. But her scruples"], [269, "THE CARYLLS. 261 were overruled. Beatrice, her travelling com panion, was loud in her lamentations at the idea of a moping journey of four or five hours, instead of joining a pleasant party of their own intimate friends and relations. \" They will be having capital fun all the way, while poor I shall have nothing to do but to envy them ; for you know, Mary, you will not be an amusing companion.\" But it was Lucy who clinched the matter. \" You will be under my protection, Mary, and George says you may do it with perfect propriety.\" \" That settles it,\" exclaimed Beatrice. \" I am sure you can have nothing to say against Mr. Shoreham's decision, a man who will be a judge one of these days. In fact, Lucy will act the part that your maid would have acted in the good old times, sitting bodkin between you and your lover when he was carrying you off to Gretna Green. Ah, if those days were to return, I think I could almost make up my mind to marry myself. What with scrambling out of window, and chaises and four, with the man of one's heart by one's"], [270, "262 THE CARYLLS. side, and a blood-thirsty brother chasing one all the way, there was some fun and excite ment in being married ; now it is a mighty tame piece of business.\" \" My dear Beatrice !\" said Mrs. Shoreham, casting an uneasy look at Gualdrada, who was listening with all her ears, and astonish ment depicted on her countenance, \" How you do rattle on!\" Lady Mary yielded. All the merit of overcoming her hesitation was given to Mr. Shoreham : perhaps her own inclination had a little to do with it. When they arrived at the Oakfield Station, which lay at nearly an equal distance from Caryll Holt and the Chase, they found Lord Isleworth with Lady Florence, and Sir Ed ward with Miss Caryll and Mr. Leycester waiting to receive them. Warm and pro longed were the greetings on both sides, and it was a work of time and difficulty to separate the party into the two flocks, who were to be driven to their separate folds. Sir Edward drove home with his two eldest daughters; Louisa and the others walked,"], [271, "263 THE CARYLLS. Gualdrada being confided by her mother to the guardianship of her uncle Edward. Her other children she had left, with great reluc tance and considerable misgiving, at Ken sington, to the care of their father, from whom she exacted a solemn promise to write to her every day. A similar injunction was laid on the head nurse, so that she might be able to check one account by the other. In addition to these precautions, her medical attendant, iu whom she had the greatest con fidence, had been requested to look in every day, and to telegraph for her at the very first symptom of anything going wrong. All these provident measures might have satisfied an ordinary mind, but they were hardly suffi cient to satisfy hers. Two or three days after her arrival at the Holt, her father congratu lated her on the continued good accounts she received from home. \" I wish I could see it in the light you do,\" she replied; \"but I own I have my doubts ; I fear they are concealing something from me. It is not natural that five children should"], [272, "264 THE CARYLLS. have nothing at all the matter with them for so many days, and in this hot weather espe cially. I think I must write to nurse to give them some cooling medicine all round.\" \" My dear,\" said her father, \" there were eight of you, instead of five, and we thought it perfectly natural that you should all enjoy good health, not for a few days, but for months and years together.\" \" Ah, yes, but that was different.\" But to return to the walking party. When they reached the Holt, they found John wait ing for them in the porch, but so pale, so emaciated, that when he took Louisa in his arms and kissed her, she could not refrain from tears. The others were no less pain fully affected by the change which a few short weeks had made in his appearance. But for the hectic on his cheek and the brilliancy of his eye, he scarcely looked like a living being. Beyond a few hurried words they could find nothing to say in reply to his welcome. Leycester came to the rescue."], [273, "265 THE CARYLLS. \" My dear Louisa,\" he said, \" you are tired with your journey. You had better go up stairs and rest a little before dinner.\" \" And I must take Gualdrada to her mother,\" said Edward. \" Where shall I find you, John, when I come down ?\" \" Here, or in my own room \u2014 that is to say in my father's room, which he has given up to me. I find some difficulty in getting up stairs now.\" Walter and he were left alone ; Leycester had joined Sir Edward. \" Are you tired, too, Wat, or shall we sit out here a little ? What a lovely evening it is,\" said John. \" But is it good for you to sit out in the open air ? Our summers are so treacherous ; there is always chill or damp in the evening air.\" \" Nothing can do me good or harm now, and I wish to enjoy what I can of this dear old place. I am only now beginning to find out how fond I am of it.\" \" And how is your cough ? Does it trouble you much ?\" VOL. II. N"], [274, "266 THE CARYLLS. \u25a0 \" No. I might almost say I have got rid of it. I feel no pain except from excessive weakness, and that seems to increase daily. My most earnest prayer is that I may be per mitted to solemnize the marriages of my brother and Louisa. If I can accomplish that, I shall have nothing further to wish for on earth, and shall be quite ready to say my Nunc Dimittis.\" Edward now joined them, and, as the even ing was really getting chilly, they entered the house. \"And now,\" said John, \"one favour I have to ask of you, and that is to make no further allusion to my illness. It can do no good, and I wish to leave behind me as pleas ant an impression as possible.\" If he did not quite succeed in this, it was from no fault of his assuredly \u2014 for nothin c could exceed his own self-control, and that with which he contrived to inspire those around him. It might be said that, without a shadow of affectation, his was the most cheer ful countenance amongst them, taking part in their conversation, though in feeble accents,"], [275, "267 THE CARYLLS. and listening to their plans with as much in terest as if there was a probability of his wit nessing their accomplishment. Self seemed completely forgotten. Head-quarters for the signing of settlements and so forth, were established at Oakfield Chase ; but the coming and going between the two hives for the next few days was inces sant. In fact, with the exception of Lady Mary, the inmates of each passed more of their time in their neighbour's domicile than they did in their own. Again Beatrice and Walter, the least occupied of the party, were thrown perpetually together ; but the princi pal bond of union now existing between them seemed to lie in the attentions which they vied with each other in lavishing on John Caryll. Walter had former sins of temper to expiate, and the affectionate commiseration which he felt for his dying brother was strongly tinged with compunction for past petulance; but with Beatrice it was simply a labour of love. In what the attraction could lie between persons so totally dissimilar it is N 2"], [276, "268 THE CARYLLS. impossible to guess ; but that she had been, and was greatly attracted by him, is indispu table ; nor, as we have already seen, did she scruple to acknowledge the influence he had acquired over her by a few short sentences, or the benefit she had derived from his admoni tions. Now was the time to show her grati tude, and every moment of which she could dispose was devoted to him. To spare him as much as possible, a slight alteration in the programme had been sug gested, and it was proposed that the wedding should take place in the church of his own parish ; but this he would not hear of. All the concession he made was to accept a bed at the Chase on the night preceding the cere mony, to which place Sir Edward and his daughters migrated at the same time. Major Caryll, in compliance with the exigencies of hymeneal etiquette, was left at the Holt, in company with Walter and Mr. Leycester. Shoreham arrived there the same night by a late train. Such an unusual spectacle as two marriages at the same time naturally attracted a large"], [277, "THE CARYLLS. 269 assemblage, and the church was crammed. Lady Mary, notwithstanding her beauty and her charm of manner, shorn as she was of orange wreath and bridesmaids, was com pletely eclipsed by Louisa Caryll, who was in full possession of those privileges, and shone forth, the queen of the hour, in undis puted supremacy. John got through the service with little apparent difficulty. The rings, on this occasion, were forthcoming at the proper time, and the ceremony was com pleted with due observance of all the rites. After a hurried breakfast,Edward and his bride took their departure for May Bank; the Ley cesters, who intended establishing themselves at once at Tuftons, remained till a somewhat later hour. It was on the third day after his marriage that Edward received a letter, which evi dently caused him great uneasiness. \" What is it, Edward?\" asked Lady Mary, who noticed his discomposure. \" A letter from Caroline, dearest. Soon after we left Oakfield, poor John had a suc cession of fainting fits, and it was only yester-"], [278, "270 THE CARYLLS. day that they were able to remove him to the Holt. He found strength to insist upon no one writing to us for two days, but Caroline says the doctor warned her that the end was very near at hand. My dear love, it is hard upon you, but I must go to him ; I promised, if in hngland, to be with him at the last. I think our best plan will be to start by the first train. I will take you first to Oakfield, and then go on by myself to the Holt. The ser vants must make up a carpet-bag for each of us, and follow as soon as they have packed up the rest of our things. Do you ap prove i \" Not quite. Why leave me at Oakfield ; why not take me with you to the Holt ?\" \" Would you, indeed, expose yourself un necessarily to so painful a scene ; I say7 un necessarily, because you have seen so little of John.\" \" Oh, Edward, is not your brother my brother ? \u2014 your home my home ?\" \" Thank you, my love, my Ruth ; we will go to the Holt together; and let us set about our preparations at once. There is no time"], [279, "THE CARYLLS. 271 to be lost, for the next train passes in less than an hour.\" The servants were summoned, the neces sary orders were given, and the Carylls were standing on the platform ten minutes before the train made its appearance. These ten minutes Edward had employed in telegraph ing to Miss Caryll \u2014 \" We are on the point of starting ; shall be home to dinner.\" They arrived none too soon. John Caryll was still alive, but died that night, or rather morning. Died as he had wished to die, re taining his faculties to the last, and cheered in his last moments by the presence of all those he loved. First of that generation of Carylls, he found a resting place in the family vault. All his family attended his funeral, which was the signal for their dispersion. The Shorehams and Brentfords, who again took possession ot Beatrice Leycester, returned to town accompanied by Walter. Major Caryll and Lady Mary lingered on at the Holt for a few days previous to their final departure, and"], [280, "272 THE CARYLLS. then they, too, winged their flight for London, in company with the Leycesters. Leycester had taken Lady Mary's house off her hands, and it was as guests in her own house that she and her husband passed the one night they remained in England after leaving the Holt. All their preparations were completed; they had taken leave of all their relations, and on the following morning they started for Folkestone and Boulogne, in which latter town they meant to sleep that night. To Edward's great satisfaction his father had been persuaded to accept an invitation from the Stuarts, for himself and Miss Caryll, to pay them a visit in the Highlands. They left the Holt for Scotland in the course of the week following the funeral."], [281, "273 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER XIII. This entire, disruption of all their family as sociations made itself sensibly felt, though in various degrees, by every member of the Caryll family, and those connected with them. Perhaps it fell lightest on the Brentfords, who had more varied occupation for their minds than the others. Of course, anything like gaiety was out of the question, but Brent ford, after the first month, generally brought home a stray man or two to dinner, and Bea trice was a host in herself. From two quar ters she had received invitations to transfer herself to a more cheerful abode, where she might take her fill of amusement, but on both occasions she had refused. She asserted, and with truth, that she had no wish for dissipa tion, nor would she have deserted the friends she was with, as long as she thought she could N 5"], [282, "274 THE CARYLLS. be of use to them. Once or twice, at her suggestion, the three had gone down on the Saturday to May Bank, and passed the Sun day there ; and on all occasions she was in defatigable in her endeavours to give a lively turn to the conversation. She also joined heart and soul with Maud in impressing upon Lord Brentford the necessity of exerting himself in his parlia mentary career, and much to the noble lord's disgust, volunteered to assist his wife in selecting a proper topic for his debut; an offer joyfully accepted by her ladyship, who had her time fully occupied with other cares. Judging by the litter of infinitesimal caps and other equally diminutive articles of apparel by which she was now always surrounded, it appeared that she was contemplating an increase of the Oakley family, and to this anticipation even politics were forced to give way. Lord Brentford listened to all the admoni tions bestowed upon him with imperturbable good humour; he even went the length of thanking his privy-councillors for the advice"], [283, "275 THE CARYLLS. with which they were good enough to favour him ; but he kept his own secret. The day arrived on which the repeal of the malt-tax was to be discussed, and he made his speech in favour of the motion with the most com plete success. It is true, he spoke under every advantage. His colleague, who left it entirely to him to defend the interests of their constituents, had taken great pains with him, and furnished him with a mass of infor mation, which his excellent memory enabled him to retain. Then personally, there was no one in or out of parliament more popular amongst all sorts and conditions of men. It was his first attempt, and that alone was sufficient to insure him a patient hearing. The very natural embarrassment with which he was beset on first rising speedily vanished beneath the encouraging cheers which greeted him, and when he informed the House that agriculture was the only firm basis on which our national prosperity rested, that commerce and manufactures may perish or may fade, but that the soil must always remain, the applause of his own party was as rapturous"], [284, "276 THE CARYLLS. as if he had made a new discovery. He then went into statistical details, which proved at least that he had studied the subject, and taken pains to make himself master of it. His speech had two merits ; it was a good deal to the purpose, and it was not long. He sat down amidst prolonged cheering, and more than one of his political opponents took an opportunity of complimenting him on his eloquence. They could afford to do it, for the motion was rejected by a very consider able majority, a trifling incident which in no wise damped his elation. The House rose early, and his two ladies were still up when he reached home. \" Oh, Brentford ! Beatrice has found a capital subject for you,\" were the first words that greeted his ears. \" It's that horrid ballot, and you must positively speak against it. We have written a sentence or two for you, just to make a beginning.\" \" Very well ; I will see about it to-mor row.\" \" No, no; you must promise now. Must he not, Beatrice?\""], [285, "277 THE CARYLLS. \"My dear love, for mercy's sake give me a little respite. I have been at it all day, and am tired to death. Let us put off the ballot till to-morrow.\" But on the morrow all was changed. When he came down to breakfast he found his wife listening with breathless attention to Miss Leycester, who was reading his speech aloud with great unction, and without omitting a single cheer. \" Oh, my dear Brentford,\" exclaimed Maud, starting up and embracing him, \" how could you be so unkind, so cruel, as not to tell us. Beatrice declares that, if she had had an idea that you were going to speak, she would have put on men's clothes, and gone into the gallery to hear you.\" \"I know she would, and it was precisely to prevent such an exposure that I said nothing of my intention.\" \"My dear Brentford,\" said Beatrice, in her turn, \" I cannot tell you how delighted I am. I told Walter weeks ago^that you had abili ties if you chose to make use of them, but I own I did not expect to see my opinion so"], [286, "278 THE CARYLLS. soon and so fully confirmed. I only wish you had been more severe on our persecutors. I believe they grudge us poor farmers the bread we eat. Oh, if you could but turn the wretches out ! \" She farmed about sixty acres herself, and understood it practically and theoretically, as well as she did everything else to which she turned her mind. More over, friend Beatrice was as pestilent a little Tory as ever breathed. \" Well, then,\" rejoined Lord Brentford, \" I suppose you will let me off about the ballot.\" But against this the two ladies loudly pro tested. Now that be had shown how well he could speak, they should expect at least one speech from him daily for the rest of the session. As regarded Walter, his feelings were of a very complex nature. The death of John had affected him deeply, but the impression was transient compared with that produced by the loss of his elder brother ; it was not till he was compelled to walk alone, that he became quite aware of the ascendancy which that brother had obtained over him. Nor was he"], [287, "279 THE CARYLLS. insensible to the loss entailed on him by the closing of Lady Mary's house ; a house in which he had always found the most cordial welcome, in which some of his happiest hours had been passed. It now belonged to his sister and her husband, but they could not replace its former mistress. At the Brentfords' he was always a welcome guest. Whenever he made his appearance in their house, all the inmates were unaffectedly glad to see him. His couvert was regularly laid at their table, without the formality of an invitation, and he not unfrequently availed himself of it ; but Maud was no longer able to devote herself so exclusively to her brother, as had been the case in her maiden days, and Beatrice divided her attention with praise worthy impartiality between all those who might chance to be present. With Brentford himself it is needless to say that he was on the best possible terms, but that noble lord's hilarity occasionally became so boisterous as to be rather oppressive to those whose spirits were not pitched to so high a key as his own. Altogether Walter felt a sense of isolation,"], [288, "280 THE CARYLLS. but fortunately the remedy was at hand. In Seymour Place he was sure of finding as warm a reception as he had formerly done at Lady Mary Segrave's. The resources against ennui or care of any sort were, no doubt, much more limited, but those were feelings which he was not likely to experience in the society of the Woods ; the topics of conversation were restricted to a much narrower compass, but at least they were full of interest for him. In short, the house of his old friends was a harbour of refuge opened for him by Provi dence ; to their kindly feelings he looked for sympathy and encouragement. He did not long delay making the experi ment. On the evening of the day which witnessed the departure of Major and Lady Mary Caryll from London, he presented him self at Mrs. Wood's door, and as he expected, found them at home. But if he reckoned on Annie's society he was doomed to disappoint ment. She heard his voice on the stairs, and exclaimed to her mother \u2014 \" I cannot see him to-night. I will put on my bonnet and go to Mrs. Smith's. They"], [289, "281 THE CARYLLS. have pressed me over and over again to look in some evening. I will pass through this room on my way out, and just wish him good night.\" This man\u0153uvre was but partially successful. Walter was so resolute in offering to escort Miss Wood to Mrs. Smith's door, that it was impossible for her to refuse. She uttered a few words of condolence on the death of his brother, aud then the conversation during their short walk turned entirely upon her own pursuits and occupations since they had last met. After depositing her in safety in the house of the linen draper, which he eyed with great curiosity, he returned with all possible expedition to her mother. \" And now tell me,\" said Mrs. Wood, on his reappearance, \" all you have been about since you left London. We saw your poor brother's death in the paper, and believe me, we felt deeply for you. Although not unex pected, it must have been a great shock to you when it came at last.\" \" It was ; but it was also a great consola tion to know that poor John was fully pre-"], [290, "282 THE CARYLLS. pared. When I die, God grant that my end may be as peaceful and as full of hope as his.\" The particulars of the double marriage then came upon the tapis, respecting which Mrs. Wood's thirst for information seemed to be insatiable. From motives of delicacy, Walter dwelt much more on his brother's marriage than he did on that of Louisa. Al though she had seemed to make light of it when she mentioned it, he felt convinced that both Mrs. Wood and her daughter must have been deeply wounded by Mr. Leycester's heartless conduct on the occasion of the vicar's death. It was therefore only incidentally, and at long intervals, that he mentioned the name of his new brother-in-law. Mrs. Wood could not but remark this reluctance, which was far from answering her purpose, and to force him to speak out she said \u2014 \" I hope novv that Mr. Leycester is actually your sister's husband, you like him a little better than you seemed to do when we last spoke of him.\" \" Neither better nor worse ; my opinion of"], [291, "283 THE CARYLLS. him remains unchanged. For Louisa's sake I shall be civil to him ; but no friendship or intimacy can ever exist between us. If it were only for his conduct to you, I should hate him ; it proves that he has not even the feelings of a gentleman.\" \" Oh, my dear Mr. Caryll, I trust that you will not allow anything I may have said to prejudice you against Mr. Leycester. He may have thought that we were not in a state to receive visits at that time, or there may have been other reasons of which we know nothing. At all events, he ought not to be condemned unheard. And now as a penance for your injurious thoughts towards him, you shall tell me all about his marriage to your sister.\" \" Willingly,\" Walter replied ; \" but upon condition that after this conversation his name shall never again be mentioned between >*> us. To this condition the worthy lady assented with great readiness, and Walter proceeded to gratify her curiosity, till Miss Wood's re turn seemed to announce that it was time to"], [292, "284 THE CARYLLS. separate. She came in so quietly that she took the others by surprise. \" How did you get in?\" asked her mother. \" We never heard you.\" \" I took the latch-key with me.\" And then followed a few questions as to how she had passed her evening, in the course of which it came out that Mr. Smith, jun., had again accompanied Miss Wood home, which act of simple courtesy Mr. Walter Caryll was disposed to look upon as a piece of great presumption. He had not, however, an opportunity of offering an opinion on the subject, as Annie soon after wished him good night, and retired to her own room, which he justly considered as a civil intimation that his absence was more desirable thau his com- pany. He very easily resumed his habit of visit ing the Woods three times a week, devoting as usual the four remaining days to the dif ferent branches of his own family, while his brother's recent death offered a fair excuse for withdrawing from general society. One evening he found Mrs. Wood suffering"], [293, "285 THE CARYLLS. from a violent bilious attack, which she de- plored the more, as Annie would be prevented from attending the Museum, probably for some days, from want of a proper escort. On this hint he spake, and with great eagerness proffered his services as Mrs. Wood's repre- sentative. For some time in vain, but his perseverance was finally crowned with suc- cess. The mother was the first to yield to his arguments ; and the daughter, to whom it was really an object of great moment not to interrupt her studies for an indefinite period, fortified by Mrs. Wood's approbation, gradually allowed her scruples to be silenced. From that time the duty of attending upon Annie to the scene of her labours, and restor- ing her in safety to her parental roof, devolved entirely upon him. Even after her mother's convalescence , he took his measures so well that but a very feeble opposition was offered to his continuance in the post he so ably filled. His greatest difficulty lay in convoying his prize to the place of her destination at that time of year, without fear of detection from"], [294, "286 THE CARYLLS. some one or other of his numerous acquaint ance. Hitherto Miss Wood and her mother had generally walked both ways, making use of an omnibus, when tired, or in case of rain. But this did not at all suit the views of Walter Caryll ; the Park was full of danger. He represented that the heat of the weather was too excessive to admit of such exertion. A walk back in the cool of the evening was all very well, but a walk there into the bargain was out of the question, and by dint of cross examination he compelled Annie to admit that, on more than one occasion, she had been obliged to rest sor ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before she could begin her drawing. Having established this point, and ascertained the profound ignorance of his deluded victims in metropolitan geography, he represented to them that the shortest road to the Kensington Museum must naturally be through Kensing ton. It was true there were no omnibusses on that line, but for two persons a cab would be quite as cheap as an omnibus, as the fare could not exceed one shilling. Even this point was conceded, but the next presented"], [295, "287 THE CARYLLS. greater difficulties, and here he was forced to succumb. Notwithstanding all his remon strances, Mrs. Wood insisted upon his accept ing the sixpences she tendered him, as her daughter's share of the cab-hire. On the whole, however, he had reason to plume him self on his ingenuity. Three days in the week, Annie was confided to his care and en sconced in a Hansom ; a vehicle he preferred, inasmuch as it enabled him to keep a bright look out down the road for any suspicious characters. For Annie Wood it was undoubt edly the pleasantest part of her day. Sheen joyed the fresh air and the rapidity of the motion ; she liked her companion, and even reverted with pleasure and animation to the olden time at Lynburn. Their excursion down the Edgeware and Bayswater roads, up Church Lane, and round by Kensington Gardens to Cromwell Road only seemed too short, and she easily believed the base im postor, who assured her that their Jehu never thought of claiming more than a shilling. The most hazardous part of the navigation"], [296, "288 THE CARYLLS. was Kensington itself, where Walter was always in dread of meeting some of the Shorehams. And, in fact, one day he did meet the children and their nurses coming out of the Gardens, but he was prepared. Look ing them steadily in the face, unperceived by his companion, he armed his features with such a diabolical grimace, that the two youngest screamed with terror as he passed them, and the penetration of the elder ones was fairly baffled ; it required much more ex perienced physiognomists to detect Uncle Walter beneath the mask he had assumed. Lucy mentioned the circumstance to him when thev next met, as it had been related tj 1 to her by the nurse, and inveighed with great warmth against the cruelty and wickedness of the man, who could have found a pleasure in frightening nearly into fits poor, little, inno cent children, who had never done him any harm. She was certain he must be a thoroughly bad man, familiar with crime in its worst shape; in which sentiments her brother expressed his entire acquiescence."], [297, "289 THE CARYLLS. So far Walter was master of the situation ; had he been paid for his services, he could not have been more regular in his attendance. He was always in Seymour Place to a minute, rather before than after, and when Annie emerged from the Museum he was always at his post. But as, after all, it is more or less of a bore to wait in the street for an hour or so in all sorts of weather, with no solace but that of a cigar, an object of comment to cab men and suspicion to the police, it struck him at length that he could not do better than enter a drawing-class himself. He had always had a turn for art, and now was the time to cultivate it. Thus he contrived to pass in Annie's society almost every evening of his life, and every day his feelings for her assumed a more decided character. For he loved her now with a passionate devotion which completely threw into the shade his former feelings for Beatrice Leyces ter. He loved her all the more perhaps that, in a worldly point of view, her position was inferior to his own. If he had not wealth to 0 VOL. II."], [298, "290 THE CARYLLS. offer her, at all events the income of which he was now in possession would insure her all the comforts which she had enjoyed in her father's lifetime, and he felt a generous plea sure in the thought that it was in his power to rescue her from a life of precarious depen dence. But how was she to be induced to accept her release from bondage at his hands ? For though their intercourse was by this time conducted upon terms of the most fami liar intimacy, though Walter talked with the utmost unreserve of all that related to himself, though in his more indiscreet moments his love oozed out in every word he uttered, he had never as yet met with any response. As regarded the common events of her outward daily life, her domestic tribulations, her anxiety for her mother, for the success of their school, and the welfare of the children committed to their charge, Annie was as open as himself. But there it stopped. Once in his presence she had given vent to her feel ings, but from the care with which she evi-"], [299, "291 THE CARYLLS. dently avoided all recurrence to the subject it seemed as if she repented her momentary in discretion. She certainly manifested no further intention of taking him for a confidant, as regarded her past experiences or her hopes for the future. As for his amatory insinuations they passed unnoticed. It seemed as if she was not aware of their meaning. But although so reserved in all that related to her own feelings, she showed abundant sympathy when Walter's conversation fell upon subjects connected with himself. She was soon more deeply initiated into his family history and the not very important secrets of his home than she had ever been before. With his father, his brother, and sisters she speedily felt as well acquainted as if half of her life had been passed at the Holt, and it was impossible to mistake the interest with which she listened to all his aspirations for success in the career which he had embraced. Being of a sanguine disposition he was rather given to building castles in the air, and Annie, o 2"], [300, "292 THE CARYLLS. by the eagerness with which she entered into all his plans aud projects, evidently believed in the possibility of their realization. But the interest she felt seemed purely objec tive, as if Mr. Walter Caryll's success in life could in no way concern herself further than as affecting the welfare of a friend. Walter knew not what to make of it. Though the two were so totally different in disposition and manner, his position with Annie Wood strongly resembled that in which he had been placed a few months before with regard to Beatrice Leycester, although from a different cause. The openness of the one had led him into error ; was he destined to be misled by the reserve of the other? Now, as then, he was convinced that he had ob tained a place in the regard of her he loved, that she looked upon him as a friend, that she even felt for him a certain amount of sisterly affection ; but naturally enough this was far from satisfying him. A year ago he would have argued that he was advancing by sure"], [301, "293 THE CARYLLS. though slow steps towards the goal ; now past experience compelled him to confess that he was no further advanced than he had been a month ago, and what his next step should be was a problem he could not solve. In fact he was brought to a dead lock. Again he found himself lying awrake, night after night, for hours together, in the vain attempt to de vise some scheme for ascertaining the real state of her feelings towards him. At one time he thought of opening his heart to Mrs. Wood; at another he determined to speak to Annie herself on the subject, and boldly avowing his love ask her to be his wife ; but again experience stepped in, and with her warning voice dissuaded him from taking so decided a step till he was more sure of his ground. Nor, indeed, was there any absolute necessity for such desperate haste. At pre sent he had Annie all to himself, and, consi dering the secluded life she led it was not very probable that a rival should spring up and bring matters to a crisis. The result of his cogitations generally was that his best"], [302, "294 THE CARYLL8. plan, for the present at all events, was to let things take their course, and trust to Provi dence for a solution of his doubts and diffi culties."], [303, "295 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER XIV. It is not to be supposed that the almost total neglect of his family, which Mr. Walter Caryll's new pursuits involved, altogether escaped observation. He paid a few morning visits to his sisters, and once accepted an invitation to dinner from the Leycesters \u2014 for, now that he had something to conceal, he had no wish to excite his brother-in-law's spirit of investigation. Having nothing of the sort to fear from Lord Brentford, he refused all his invitations without ceremony, sometimes on the most frivolous pretences. Lucy Shore- ham was the one who fared the best. He knew the strong attachment that existed between her and Major Caryll ; the high re spect in which Edward held her judgment and good sense, except, perhaps, where her children were concerned ; and he looked upon her as a sort of legacy bequeathed to his affec-"], [304, "296 THE CAKYLLS. tion by the brother they both loved so well. Perhaps, too, he felt that, should he ever need advice, he could nowhere find a better or a safer councillor. It was in her house he passed his Sunday evenings The Leycesters left town, but the Brentfords still remained, and one night Walter, on his return home, found on his table a formal note of invitation to dinner for the following day from Lord and Lady Brentford, with an inti mation that no refusal would be accepted, as they intended leaving town the day after. Walter's conscience did prick him a little for the cool indifference with which of late he had treated his sister, and, before he went to bed, he wrote two notes \u2014 one accepting the Brent fords' invitation, and the other to Mrs. Wood, to announce the engagement which would prevent his having the pleasure of drinking tea with her on the following evening. His first thoughts on waking were directed to the examination, which he felt certain was hanging over him, and the best method of answering or evading all awkward enquiries ; but he had completed his toilet before he"], [305, "THE CARYLLS. 297 could see his way clearly out of the wood, and he had scarcely eaten the first mouthful of his breakfast when Lord Brentford burst into the room. \" Just in time, I see,\" he exclaimed \" so send for another plate and cup, for I am come to breakfast with you, and to see that you send a proper answer to our invite. Maud vows that, if you refuse us this time, she not only will never speak to you again, but will cut you off with a shilling.\" \" If that is the case,\" replied Walter, \" I am glad my answer was written before you came, so she cannot accuse me of mercenary motives. There it is on the table behind >\u00bb you. \" Is this it? Why, this is for Mrs. Wood ! Who on earth is Mrs. Wood ? Oh ! I see, here it is. That's all right,\" continued his lordship ; \" and now explain what you have been about for the last month, that we can none of us get a glimpse of you. Leycester has been framing all sorts of theories to ac count for it for the edification of his wife and o 5"], [306, "298 THE CARYLLS. mine. He has been pointing out the dangers of low society for ingenuous youth, and even suggested the possibility of some artful woman having taken you in tow.\" \" I wish Mr. John Leycester would mind his own business, and leave other people to mind theirs,\" exclaimed Walter, in great wrath, and turning very red. \" I should have thought that, as we have none of us been into society since poor John's death, he might have known that no woman could have had an opportunity of taking me in tow, to use his own slang expression.\" \"No, no,\" said Lord Brentford, laughing, \" you must not put that upon Leycester's shoulders ; the slang is mine, though the sense is his. But Leycester, as a Cambridge man, being well up in logic, would tell you that your argument is good sor nothing. There are as many classes of women as there are of men, and they do not all inhabit Bel gravia, or Grosvenor Square. I see your friend Mrs. Wood dwells in a more humble locality.\" \" Mrs. Wood is my laundress !\" growled"], [307, "THE CARYLLS. 299 out Walter ; nor was it absolutely untrue \u2014 curiously enough the name of his washer woman was Wood. \" But why do you cut us all ?\" persisted his lordship. \" You know how fond Maud is of you, and you ought not to neglect her. I will say nothing of myself and Beatrice Ley cester, though we have, both of us, reason to feel hurt with you \u2014 for you can go to the Shorehams sometimes, though you cannot come to us. If you do not go into society, how do you pass your time ? Do you go much to the theatres ?\" \" No, never,\" Walter replied. Then, as a bright idea struck him, he continued, \" The fact is, I have taken to drawing. I have never mentioned it to any one as yet, for I am quite a beginner, but I go regularly to an evening drawing-class at the South Kensing ton Museum, and as I cannot get away much before ten, I literally have no time for any thing else.\" \" By Jove !\" exclaimed Lord Brentford, \" what a capital idea. I have no turn for that sort of thing myself, but I envy those"], [308, "300 THE CARYLLS. who have. My is, that the more occupations a man has, the happier he will be. So now that I have drunk up your coffee and eaten up your tongue, and there is no thing more to be got out of you, I shall de part ; and when you come to dinner bring some of your sketches with you. Maud and Bee will like to look at them.\" \" Very well, I will ; though really as yet I have nothing worth looking at.\" \" Never mind that ; bring what you have got.\" And as Mr. Walter was very anxious to ex tinguish any suspicions which might have been conceived to his disadvantage, he did not fail to arm himself with these substantial proofs of his veracity. He had no cause to complain of the recep tion he met with in Portman Square. Lady Brentford was perfectly satisfied with the ex planations which she had received through her husband, corroborated as they were by ocular demonstration of her brother's industry. His drawings, which were really very creditable for a novice, received more than their due"], [309, "301 THE CARYLLS. meed of praise, while she threw all her old affectionate warmth of manner into her wel come of the artist. \" Dear Walter,\" she said, \" even if I felt that I had a right to scold you, I should not have the heart to do it, when I see how well you have been employed. I do hope you will not give it up.\" Miss Leycester was also warm in her com mendations, and uttered not a word of re proach, a circumstance which gave him great relief, for he had fully expected to find him self the object of her facetious animadversions. But something seemed to tell her that the time for that was passed. She had pricked up her ears when Lord Brentford first an nounced the new turn his brother-in-law's mental activity had taken, and when she re collected all that had passed between them with reference to ]the Woods, she could not but suspect that there was something more than met the ear in Walter's sudden enthu siasm for artistic pursuits. But she kept her suspicions to herself. After all, it was no business of hers, and she recoiled from any-"], [310, "302 THE CARYLLS. thing like an allusion to a subject of so deli cate, not to say equivocal, a nature. She felt intuitively that she and Walter no longer stood in the same position to each other that they bad done two months before. There certainly was no diminution of regard on either side, still less anything like a coldness; but something or somebody seemed to stand between them. She had suspected it when they were at May Bank together ; now she felt certain of it, and it gave her more pain than she could have believed possible. It was not that she was in love with him now, any more than when she had refused him in the winter. Were the same scene to be re peated, the result would still be the same, but she could not quite reconcile herself to the idea that another should reign in the heart which had so lately been hers- Something like a sensation of mortified pride took pos session of her, and inspired her with redoubled caution. She was equally unwilling to give the slightest clue to her own feelings, or to allow Walter to suppose that she had dis covered his. A close observer might have"], [311, "303 THE CARYLLS. noticed a shade of embarrassment in her first greeting, but by degrees she resumed her habitual ease of manner, and was soon con versing with him as familiarly as ever. The past having been satisfactorily disposed of, the conversation turned to the future. The Brentfords were going to the Chase for a week or ten days, after which they intended to pay some visits, aud to return to town in autumn for her ladyship's confinement. Miss Ley cester was to accompany them to Oakfield, and then, under the protection of Lord Isle worth, proceed to Scotland on a visit to the Stuarts. \" And do tell Caroline, when you see her,\" said Walter, \" to write to me and give me a particular account of my father. The only news I ever get of either of them is in a round about way through Lucy. I promised Ed ward to replace him as well as I could, and as soon as I hear of his arrival, I mean to write to him, and give him all our home news.\" \" I will make her sit down and write you sour pages at least, as soon as I get there,\" replied Beatrice. Then from some sudden"], [312, "304 THE CARYLLS. impulse, she added, \" And what is more, I will write to you myself, and give you every particular relating to Sir Edward.\" \" Will you, indeed ? That will be really kind ; and I hope you will allow me to send you a line in return, if only to acknowledge the receipt of yours.\" \"A line in return!\" exclaimed Lord Brentford ; \" I should think so. What lady ever wrote to a man without expecting ten lines in return for every one of hers ! Depend upon it, Bee, who is a dab with the hook and line will send you a small gudgeon of a letter with the intention of catching a whale.\" \" Oh, Walter may write as long or as short an answer as he pleases, though the longer the better. When I am out of London I like to know what is going on in it, and above all how its unfortunate inhabitants bear my loss.\" She coloured a little, probably from former recollections, but she spoke without hesita tion. No doubt she felt that Walter was not likely to draw down any fresh reproof upon his head. \" And now, Master Wat,\" said Lord Brent-"], [313, "305 THE CARYLLS. ford, as his brother-in-law was taking leave, \" have the goodness to remember that you are engaged to us for the very first day after our return. We don't mean in future to let the fine arts monopolise you entirely.\" \" When do you expect to be back?\" \" Early in October, I believe ; but I have no voice in this or any other matter. If I could have had my own way we should have passed the rest of the year abroad ; but it appears that Maud has made other engage ments, which, according to her, must take place of everything else.\" \" Nonsense, Brentford,\" said his wife, blushing. \" Good-bye, and God bless you, dear Walter ; let me hear from you some times.\" \" And I too say good-bye and God bless you, dear Walter,\" said Beatrice, with the slightest possible tremor in her voice. \" God bless you, and be prudent.\" \"Be prudent! In what?\" \" In all things. Is it not very good advice for one friend to give another?\" \" Yes, certainly. But I do not quite \u2014 \""], [314, "306 THE CARYLLS. \" Well, if it is good advice, profit by it. Good-bye.\" While Walter was passing his evening in Portman Square, a conversation of a nature very interesting to those whom it concerned was carried on in Seymour Place. Annie Wood and her mother, although the warmest affection existed between them, had never been on very confidential terms, at all events since the young lady had emerged from childhood. With the one great secret of her daughter's heart Mrs. Wood had become ac quainted, it is true, but not till the evil was done, and even then she owed her knowledge of it to no voluntary disclosure on Annie's part, from whom it was almost wrung by the force of circumstances, She had no great faith in her mother's power of keeping her own counsel, although in this particular case she had no reason to complain of any want of discretion ; but she did ample justice to the many excellent qualities which Mrs. Wood really possessed. She was good-hearted, good-tempered, and charitable, devoted to her husband and daughter, and, as far as her"], [315, "307 THE CARYLLS. lights went, conscientious in the discharge of her duties to both, as well as to the young men who had at different times been inmates of her house, and whom she looked upon for the time being as members of her family. In short, if not quite a Solomon in petticoats, she was a very well-meaning woman; but like many other well-meaning individuals, her efforts were sometimes rather injurious than beneficial to those she wished to serve. To this negative failing she added more posi tive defects. She was vain, not of her per sonal attractions, which had been great, but of her intellectual powers, which were in no way remarkable. In justice to her it must be added that hers was a large-hearted vanity, extending to her husband and child, and even to her husband's pupils, whom, in their various ways, she looked upon as paragons of perfection. Then again, when it was within reach, she was greatly addicted to gossip, and liked it none the worse if flavoured with a soupgon of scandal ; she was exceedingly in quisitive in all matters that could by any possibility concern her, and still more so in"], [316, "308 THE CARYLLS. those that did not. One of the surest roads to her favour was to confide to her a secret; but once in her power it was seldom a secret long. Probably she thought it would savour of selfishness to keep delicacies of that nature for her own private use. Her great grievance, indeed her only one, as regarded Annie, was that she was so close. \" How dull it seems without Mr. Caryll !\" was her remark on the evening in question, when she found herself alone with her daughter. \" I have got so used to his drop ping in to tea that I quite miss him Do not you too, Annie ?\" \" Yes, mother. And yet, to confess the truth, I am not sorry to have an evening alone. I generally have to sit up an hour or two later to get the children's lessons ready, when his visits ure prolonged, and latterly this has often been the case. I have been more than once tempted to remind him that we are obliged to be up early, and cannot afford to sit up late.\" \" Oh, my love, he might be offended, and think we want to get rid of him altogether."], [317, "THE CARYLLS. 309 And I should be sorry for that for more rea sons than one.\" \" Yes, I suppose it would not be altogether civil; and after all it will probably, sooner or later, die a natural death.\" \" A natural death ! What is to die a natural death ?\" \" Mr. Caryll's intimacy with us. You know he told us that he was thinking of applying for some diplomatic employment abroad, in exchange for his clerkship, and that would effectually put an end to our intercourse.\" \" Yes, I remember his speaking of it in a vague sort of way, as I have heard him speak of other projects, and I also remember his saying that he did not suppose he had much chance of success. And of one thing I am certain, on account of his father he would not think of leaving England till Major Caryll's return. But if he were going abroad next week, it would lie with you to decide if that should make any interruption of your intercourse.\" \"With me! How so?\" said Miss Wood,"], [318, "310 THE CARYLLS. blushing, for she perfectly understood her mother's meaning. \" My meaning is plain enough. If he were to go abroad, it would lie with you to accompany him as his wife. He loves you, Annie.\" \" Oh ! mother, believe me, you are mis taken ; at least, I hope so.\" \" I think,\" replied Mrs. Wood, with a self satisfied smile, \" you may trust to my pene tration in such matters- Walter Caryll loves you, and why you should hope I am mistaken I cannot imagine, for you like him well enough.\" \" Tes, I like him as a friend; I think I may almost say as a brother. I have every confi dence in his good will, but I have no wish to be his wife.\" \" And why not ? With the feelings you profess for him now, you would soon learn to love him as a wife.\" \" Ah, no ; all power of loving is crushed out of my heart for ever.\" \" My love, my darling, do not say that."], [319, "THL CARYLLS. 311 Ever since that terrible night when I told you of that wretch's engagement to Louisa Caryll you have been so patient, shown so much courage, that I was in hopes all recollection of him was dying out.

Instead of love there are contempt and hatred, and a desire of revenge. He found me affectionate and confiding, and after an engagement of nearly five years, he leaves me nothing but a heart filled with bitterness and distrust.\" \" Would to God,\" said Mrs. Wood, \" I had known of this unfortunate business sooner ; while your poor father was yet alive ; he would have appealed to his old friend, Mr. Leycester's father, and seen justice done you.\" \" And I am only sorry,\" murmured Annie, \" that in a moment of weakness I allowed you to force my secret from me. Why should I add my sorrows to your own ! \""], [320, "312 THE CARYLLS. \" I never liked that man,\" continued Mrs. Wood, who apparently had not heard her daughter's observation. She no doubt forgot that, when Mr. John Leycester was her hus band's pupil, she had promoted his intimacy with her daughter by every means in her power. \" I never liked that man ; and when he avoided us so pointedly after your poor father's death, T always thought he meant to break his engagement.\" \" Ah, but you do not know what had passed between us.\" \" I know what you tdd me ; that you had been engaged for some time, and that as soon as he was his own master he had promised to return and claim you as his wife. There was nothing more I suppose.\" \" No, no, nothing,\" Annie replied hastily. \" But the last time I saw him before he went abroad he said, 'Happen what may, never doubt my love and truth.'

I thought that at least he was a man of honour ; I know him now to be a cold-blooded, perjured villain.\" She spoke so bitterly, that her mother was rather startled, but after a short pause she continued more calmly, \" but, dearest mother, let us talk no more of him.\" \" Well, my love, only this. If you wish to prove to him how completely you have cast him from your thoughts, you will marry his brother-in-law, a man superior to him in every respect.\" \" No, no. How could I venture to offer any one a heart so soiled as mine ! And to Walter, so good, so trusting, so generous and noble-hearted ! It would be treachery, unless I told him all, and that I could not do.\" \" My love, listen to me. To talk of your heart being soiled, because a villain did his best to break it, is nonsense.

I know for my part,\" she continued with a simper, \"before I married your poor father I had no lack of admirers. Indeed, I was engaged to poor Captain O'Geoghegan, who was afterwards killed in India, but we both thought better of it, and I think I may say I made none the worse wife for that. As to informing Mr. Caryll of what has passed between you and John Leycester, there is not the least neces sity for it ; indeed, now that he has married Miss Caryll, it would be indelicate, and in all probability would sow the seeds of everlast ing dissension between the two brothers-in law.\" \" I cannot, indeed I cannot,\" exclaimed Miss Wood. \" For mercy's sake urge me no longer to an act which I know would be wrong.\" \" I must, I must, in mercy to you and myself.
