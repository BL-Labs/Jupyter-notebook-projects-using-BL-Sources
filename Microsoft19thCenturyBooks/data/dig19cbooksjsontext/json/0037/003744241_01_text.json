SIZE OF COURT. Single Court is 27 feet in width and 78 feet in length ; the Double Court is 36 feet in width and 78 feet in length. In Single Court the service lines extend full across the Court; in Double Court they ter minate on each side within 4! feet of the outside lines of the Court, so that their total length is only 27 feet. THE NET. The height of the net should be 3 feet 6 inches at the posts and 3 feet at the centre. THE BALLS, The balls shall not measure less than 2j-| inches nor more than i\\ inches in diameter ; and shall weigh not less than i| ounces nor more than 2 ounces. CHOICE OF SIDES. The choice of sides and the right of serving during the first game shall be decided by toss ; provided that, if the winner of the toss choose the right to serve, the other player shall have the choice of sides, and vice versa. POSITION OF PLAYERS. The players shall stand on opposite sides of the net ; the player who first delivers the ball is called server, the other the striker-out. At the end of the first game the striker-out shall become server, and the server shall become striker-out, and so on alternately in the sub sequent games of the set. In the three-handed game the simple player shall serve in every alternate game. In the four-handed game the pair who have the right to serve in the first game may decide which partner may do so, and the oppos ing pair may decide similarly for the second game. The partner of the player who served in the first game shall serve in the third : and the partner of the player who served in the second game snail serve in the fourth ; and the same order shall be observed in all the subsequent games of a set. At the beginning of the next set, either partner of the pair which struck out in the last game of the last set may serve, and the same privilege is given to their opponents in the second game of the new set. The players shall take the service"], [246, "240 THE VACATION JOURNAL. alternately throughout each game ; no player shall receive or return a service delivered to his partner ; and the order of service and of striking out, once arranged, shall not be altered, nor shall the striker-out change Courts to receive the service before the end of the set. RULES. I. The server shall have one foot outside of the base line and the other either on or in a perpendicular line above the base line, and shall deliver the service from the right and left courts alternately, beginning from the right. 2. The ball served must drop within the service line, half-court line, and side line of the court, which is diagonally opposite to that from which it was served, or upon any such line. In double court the rule is the same, except that the service side line takes the place of the side line. 3. It is a fault if the server fail to strike the ball, or if the ball served drop in the net, or beyond the service line, or out of court, or in the wrong court ; or if the server do not stand as directed by law I. 4. A ball falling on a line is regarded as falling in the court bounded by that line. 5. A fault cannot be taken. 6. After a fault the server shall serve again from the same court from which he served that fault, unless it was a fault because he served from the wrong court. 7. A fault cannot be claimed after the next service is delivered. 8. The server shall not serve till the striker-out is ready. If the latter attempt to return the service he shall be deemed ready. 9. A service or fault delivered when the striker-out is not ready, counts for nothing. 10. The service shall not be volleyed, i. e., taken, before it has touched the ground. 11. A ball is in play on leaving the server's racket, except as pro vided for in law 3. 12. It is a good return, although the ball touch the net ; but a service, otherwise good, which touches the net, shall count for nothing. 13- The server wins a stroke if the striker-out volley the service,"], [247, "THE VACATION JOURNAL. 241 or if he fail to return the service or the ball in play ; or if he return the service or the ball in play so that it drops outside of his oppo nent's court ; or if he otherwise lose a stroke, as provided by law 15. 14. The striker-out wins a stroke if the server serve two consecu tive faults ; or if he fail to return the ball in play ; or if he return the ball in play so that it drops outside of his opponent's court ; or if he otherwise lose a stroke as provided by law 15. 15. Either player loses a stroke if he return the service or the ball in play so that it touches a post of the net ; or if the ball touch him or anything that he wears or carries, except his racket in the act of striking ; or if he touch the ball with his racket more than once ; or if he touch the net or any of its supports while the ball is in play ; or if he volley the ball before it has passed the net. 16. In case any player is obstructed by any accident, the ball shall be considered a let. 17. On either player winning his first stroke, the score is called 15 for that player ; on either player winning his second stroke, the score is called 30 for that player ; on either player winning his third stroke, the score is called 40 for that player ; and the fourth stroke won by either player is scored game for that player, except as be low : If both players have won three strokes, the score is called deuce ; and the next stroke won by either player is scored advantage for that player. If the same player wins the next stroke, he wins the game ; if he loses the next stroke, the score returns to deuce 5 and so on until one player wins the two strokes immediately fol lowing the score of deuce, when game is scored for that player. 18. The player who first wins six games wins the set ; except as below : If both players win five games the score is called games all; and the next game won by either player is scored advanta. for that player. If the same player wins the next game,: he wins the set ; if he loses the next game, the score returns to game all ; and so on, until either player wins the two games immediately fol lowing the score of games all, when he wins the set.. Bat individ ual clubs, at their own tournaments, may modify this rule at their discretion. 19. The players shall change sides at the end of every set ; but the umpire, on appeal from either player, before the toss for choice, may direct the players to change sides at the end of each set, if. in"], [248, "242 THE VACATION JOURNAL. his opinion, either side have a distinct advantage owing to the sun, wind, or any other accidental cause ; but if the appeal be made after the toss for choice, the umpire can only direct the players to change sides at the end of every game of the odd or deciding set. 20. When a series of games is played, the player who served in the last game of one set shall be striker-out in the first game of the next. This rule, when applied to a four-handed game, only pre scribes that the side that last served shall strike out in the first game of the next set. Which of the two players shall serve is left to their option. 21. The referee shall call the game after an interval of five min utes between sets if either player so order. 22. In matches the decision of the umpire shall be final. Should there be two umpires, they shall divide the court between them, and the decision of each shall be final in his share of the court. ODDS. I. A bisque is one point which can be taken by the receiver of the odds at any time in the set except as follows : (a) A bisque cannot be taken after a service is delivered. (b) The server may not take a bisque after a fault, but the striker out may do so. 2. One or more bisques may be given to increase or diminish other odds. 3. Half fifteen is one stroke given at the beginning of the second, fourth, and every subsequent alternate game of a set. 4. Fifteen is one stroke given at the beginning of every game of a set. 5. Half thirty is one stroke given at the beginning of the first game, two strokes given at the beginning of the second game, and so on alternately in all the subsequent games of the set. 6. Thirty is two strokes given at the beginning of every game of a set. 7. Half forty is two strokes given at the beginning of the first game, three strokes given at the beginning of the second game, and so on alternately, in all the subsequent games of the set."], [249, "THE VACATION JOURNAL. 243 8.
