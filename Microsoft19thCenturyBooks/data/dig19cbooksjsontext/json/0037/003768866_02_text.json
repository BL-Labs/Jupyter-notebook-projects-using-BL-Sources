I think I am a little tired of stories in which a marvellously clever villain devises an elaborate scheme which I know will be over- thrown by a still cleverer detective. I am only irritated by the difficulties he surmounts, be- cause I am certain he will come to a difficulty not to be surmounted. I hate the virtuous detective, while I am apt to take a pitying interest in the villain, and sometimes to my sudden horror I have found myself cordially wishing him success in the evil cause for which he has battled so gallantly.

Very likely it is true enough that many a scheme is patiently thought out, skilfully carried on, and ruined at the last moment by some silly oversight which a child might have avoided. But sometimes the truth is just the other way. If, in spite of all precautions, the gallant ship goes down, what frail and unseaworthy vessels have accomplished as tounding voyages in safety! If the skilful Alpine climber loses his footing and perishes, what benighted travellers, or children, or timid women have groped their way in darkness through perils they would have feared to face by day ! Did you ever notice children launching a tiny fleet of walnut-shells with little sails ? The wrecks are many and swift, but now and then a boat will glide out of reach and out of sight, dancing gaily and safely over the troubled waters. Sissy had put all Brackenhill into a walnut-shell and launched it. Hitherto it had sailed miraculously well, but the waves were growing high. The first indication of the rising tempest came one day early in May. On that day a cloud drifted between herself and Percival. It was a bright, sunshiny morning, more"], [15, "' THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER. 3 like the May of the poets than that of our ordinary experience. Sissy, who was in great demand among her girl friends now that her marriage was little more than a month dis tant, had promised to spend the day with Laura Falconer. Percival was her escort, and they had dispensed with the attendance of a groom on their nine-miles ride. They had both enjoyed it. Never had the country lanes looked more lovely. Their thin new veil of green showed the form of every bough, soon to be lost in the abundant foliage of June. The banks were sprinkled with wild hyacinths, the hedges with hawthorn blossom, the blue overhead with flakes of whitest cloud. The very air seemed full of life and joy, kissing Sissy's cheeks till they looked as if two wild roses had opened a month before their time, and quickening the blood in Percival's veins, till, blithe and careless, he felt himself one with very spring itself, and in the gladness of the moment quoted \u2014 What if we still ride on, we two, With life for ever old yet new, Changed not in kind but in degree, The instant made eternity, \u2014 And heaven just prove that I and she Ride, ride together, for ever ride ? ' I like that,' said Sissy. But, after a moment, she added, ' That is a very strange B 2"], [16, "'FOR percival. 4 idea, though. I never fancied there could be any horses in heaven.' Percival laughed. ' It seems to me,' he said, ' that women are far more sentimental than men. You excel us in delicate associations, memo- ries, feelings ; but I don't believe you have half the imagination. You are so literal, you must have everything definite. Women believe in tangible white robes, in palms and crowns and golden pavements. The lover dreams of the joy of an endless, buoyant flight through space with his lady, and she questions whether she can admit any animals fit for riding into her conception of heaven !' ' You'll certainly frighten the horses if you go on so,' said Sissy. ' Do you suppose you have nearly done ? ' ' Quite,' he answered meekly. ' Then you may tell me the name of that poem.' ' The Last Ride Together.' ' Oh, Percival ! ' in a tone of reproach. ' How could you go quoting such a dreadful thing about us ? Aren't you ashamed of yourself, you bad boy ? ' 'What now? It won't make this our last ride, will it ? And, if it were the last, I should like to remember that it was perfect enough to deserve the quotation.'"], [17, "' THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER.' 5 (Later he did remember it.) Sissy remained unconvinced, and declined to hear another syllable about the poem. And just before they reached their destination, the poetry of their ride was exchanged for a very unpleasant matter of fact. Her horse was decidedly lame. Percival and the Falconers' groom held a consultation over the injury. He went straight from the stables to the drawing-room, where Sissy was being petted and fondled, and questioned about her presents, the brides maids' dresses, and all the arrangements for the wedding-day. ' You can't ride Gipsy home,' said he. At this there was some consternation. Mrs. Falconer declared that Percival should go home by himself, and leave Sissy with them for the night. When that plan was declared impossible, Laura meditated for a moment, and then proposed that, as soon as her brother Willie came in, he should be sent down to the Rectory. ' They have such a nice pony there,' she said. ' Agnes, the eldest girl, often rides it. I am sure they would lend it to you. You could send it back to morrow.' ' Easily, but I don't know them,' said Percival. ' How can I ask ?'"], [18, "6 ' FOR PERCIVAL. ' You are not groins: to ask them. Willie will do that. He doesn't at all dislike going to the Rectory. Oh, we will settle it all, and take the greatest care of poor Gipsy too, so don't bother yourself about it' Percival declared that she was very kind. ' I only wish we were better off for horses,' said Miss Falconer. ' But those fat old things of ours Oh, mamma, don't look so indignant, you know they never do anything but stand there eating their heads off. Well, then, those magnificent animals which drag our old carriage would not quite do for riding. And Willie's horse is a brute \u2014 you can't think how it kicks !' ' That wouldn't do then,' said SiSpSy. ' I must go and look at Gipsy, poor old fellow ! ' Percival and Laura accompanied her, and while she coaxed her favourite he inquired in an eager aside, ' How do you think she looks ? ' ' Much better,' was the answer. ' More like herself.' ' I am afraid it is partly the ride. She hasn't that pretty rose-colour always,' he said anxiously. ' Still, I'm sure she's better, and when I get her away ' ' You think she will be better still ? Very likely, for we must remember that this is a trying time for her, so many leave-takings, such a fuss of preparation.'"], [19, "' THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER.' 7 As the three strolled round the garden, Laura smiled a little, noticing Percival's con stant thought for Sissy. 'What devotion!' she said to herself. She could not but own that this air of watchful and tender courtesy suited him well, and made every little attention seem earnest. ' They are a model pair of lovers,' she thought. ' He looks the character, and he doesn't take the bloom off his court ship with nasty slang either. If I were a painter, I would make a picture of them, here and now.' Sissy was saying, ' I like your three old cedars on your sloping lawn so much, Laura. When I was a little girl I always thought of Lebanon as something like your garden.' ' And smelling just like Keswick, no doubt,' Percival suggested. ' Lebanon darkens our drawing-room win dow a good deal,' said Miss Falconer. ' And there is no help for it. It would be a sin to cut them down, and you can't prune cedars.' ' I don't call your drawing-room dark,' said Sissy, as they went in. ' Perhaps not at ten minutes to one on a sunshiny spring day. But if it were a No vember afternoon, or even if the bank of cloud over there came up and hid the sun, you would see.'"], [20, "8 ' FOR PERCIVAL. 'I can imagine it,' said Percival. 'Just now the light is perfect' The house was partly covered with a vine, -and the oriel window had a quivering border of leaves and tendrils. Through the cedars outside came blue gleams of sky, like glorious sapphires, gleams which were ten times more deep and lucid for their sombre setting. The room, with its polished floor and paneling, seemed full of golden touches of sunlight, mixed with the delicate tracery of vine-leaf shadows, and the soft, swaying gloom of the cedars. ' These bright spring mornings so often cloud over and lose their beauty,' said Laura ; ' and then it is cold, for there is no warmth, except just in the sunshine.' ' Don't you think their uncertainty is partly what makes them so beautiful ? ' asked Percival. It was two hours later; they had had their luncheon, and the three young people were talking in the drawing-room. Laura was tatting ; Sissy, seated by her on a low otto man, played with her scissors, her cotton, her crochet-hook, and anything else on which she could lay her idle little hands. Laura re gretted aloud that Willie had not come in. ' I fear it is dull for you, Mr. Thorne,' she"], [21, "THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER. 9 said. ' So stupid of Willie ! He is about somewhere with papa, I suppose. If he had come in, you could have smoked, and talked about dogs and horses, and played billiards and enjoyed yourselves. And now I'm afraid you are bored.' ' If that fear isn't the reflection of your own feelings, let me remind you that I'm not a smoker, and assure you that I am much happier here,' said Thorne eagerly. So he remained, idling over the books on the table, looking at the albums and talking. They happened to speak of some one who was fond of quoting. ' Heaven defend me from quotations ! ' exclaimed Percival. ' Never quote.' ' Oh, Percival ! And you do it dreadfully.' ' Sissy,' he said, in a tone of grave re monstrance, ' how am I ever to shine in conversation if you make such remarks ? I shall be put to silence.' ' That would be a pity, wouldn't it ? ' ' I should think it would. Our deeds show what we are, our talk shows what we would be. Now as my forte is rather precept than example ' ' There'll be nothing left if Sissy snubs you,' said Laura. ' Pray don't be snubbed. We are all attention.'"], [22, "10 'FOR PERCIVAL. ' Never quote,' he resumed, as calmly as if he had not been interrupted at all. 'I saw the folly of it last week when I was away from Brackenhill. It was one of those glorious nights, and I was looking at the sky . \u2014 a splendid sky \u2014 a vast space of white veined with blue, and behind it the moon, steadily gliding, with two or three golden stars. Above that was a solemn height, and motionless wreaths of cloud flung across it here and there. Do you see it at all ? ' ' Very well indeed,' Miss Falconer assured him. ' I stared at it and said nothing. Never call people to look at a sky, or a picture, or anything that touches you, unless you are very sure of their stock of adjectives and your own. Else there is no knowing what may happen. She may be driven to say, \" Isn't it lovely ? \" And you, in desperation, may reply, \"Stunning ! \" or \" First-rate ! \" And then how can you ever respect yourselves or each other again ? I pause for a reply.' ' Don't pause. We seem to be advancing rather slowly.' ' Presently up came the man I was with.' \" What are you looking at ? Oh, I say ! \" He had the grace to be silent for about five seconds. Then he burst out with, \" Look at"], [23, "' THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER.' 11 that now \u2014 isn't that Shelley exactly ?

Ah I have it.\" It was in \" The Cloud ; \" no doubt you know it ? \u2014 That orbed maiden, with white fire laden, Whom mortals call the moon, Glides glimmering o'er my fleecelike floor. But he wasn't satisfied. \" That's it,\" he said, \" but that isn't all. There's a bit somewhere which gives that effect of an infinite multitude of little clouds.

At last he lighted on what he wanted, and spouted it triumphantly \u2014 A multitude Of handbreadth cloudlets \u2014 \" That's it, you know,\" he said.

Look there ! \" We both looked, and burst out laughing. It had grown grey while we were fitting it with a description ! ' Percival had finished his story without any change of tone, but towards the end his eyes were wandering out of the window. It seemed to him that it certainly was one of the Brackenhill carriages turning in at the gate, yet he feared to startle Sissy by the announcement till he should be perfectly sure. What could induce them to send the broug-ham ? Some startling* event \u2014 for it undoubtedly was the brougham. ' Don't I hear something driving in ? ' asked Laura. ' Yes. A visitor you will be surprised to see \u2014 as I am ! ' he exclaimed. There was an impatient pull at the bell. ' Sissy, guess \u2014 but no, there is no time.

(There had been a little flirtation in old days, and Laura, though not seriously wounded, had a soft place still in her heart for him, and was apt to think of him by his Christian name.) ' Quite sure,' said Percival. ' Sissy, listen to me. He is changed a good deal \u2014 be prepared \u2014 try not to look shocked. Dear, are you listening ? ' ' Yes.' She lifted her eyes to him. They were full of terror and despair. 'What is the matter ? Sissy, it is not so bad as that' He stopped, and looked towards the opening door. There was a little pause before Horace followed the servant who stood ready to announce him. Sissy got up, and took hold of the back of the chair from which Laura had risen. She tried hard to be very calm. She fixed her eyes on a brilliant spot of red in the rug ; it almost seemed to rise and burn beneath her gaze, but she was afraid to look away. ' Mr. Horace Thorne.

I am extremely well, and don't care what you think.' ' Didn't expect to see me, did you ? ' he said, with a nervous laugh as he greeted Laura, who happened to stand nearest. ' That doesn't make us the less glad,' she answered brightly. He was hurriedly shak ing hands with Percival. ' Glad to see you back again, old fellow,' said the latter. But Horace had turned to Sissy with eager eyes. ' My little Sissy ! Why, what an age it is since I've seen you ! ' He had her cold little fingers in his clasp. ' And what a lazy little woman never to write ! ' She looked up quickly as he stooped to kiss her, yet, though she looked up, her eyes avoided his, and she turned a little so that he kissed her cheek and their lips did not meet. ' Oh, I can't write letters,' she said, ' and Auntie wrote, and Percival.' Horace drew back a little, and remem bered what his mother had said. ' No doubt Sissy will be the same to you, if your cousin will let her A He let her hand fall. ' How did you come ? ' said Percival. ' Yes, you forget we are all dying of curio sity,' Miss Falconer chimed in. ' How far"], [29, "' THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER.' 15 have you travelled to-day ? And are you quite worn out ? What sort of passage did you have ? ' ' One question at a time. How far have I travelled to-day ? Not very far \u2014 this morning from town \u2014 this afternoon from Brackenhill.' 'But where was Aunt Harriet?' said Percival. ' She could not have let you desert her so quickly, I know.' ' She had taken the pony chaise and left word for you that she should be home to dinner. So I asked the governor how he was, and he said, \" Quite well.\" Then the governor asked me how I was, and I said \" Quite well.\" And after a little more con versation \u2014 about up to that sample \u2014 I said I thought I'd look you up.' ' How nice of you ! ' exclaimed Laura. ' But aren't you very tired ? ' ' Tired ? No, what should make me tired ? Driving nine miles in the brougham ? My good fellow,' turning to Percival, ' what are you shoving that easy-chair at me for ? Keep it for yourself.' ' May as well sit as stand,' was the calm reply.

' ' The nigr*ht before last. We had a g;ood passage.' Sissy had moved into the oriel window, and now spoke in a tremulous voice. ' Do you ever cough now, Horace.' ' I don't know. Yes, now and then a little. Habit, you know ; one doesn't get out of the way of a thing all at once. Mere trick, I believe ; I must break myself of it' ' That's good news,' said Percival. Horace made his boast, as before, with the glance which wandered from face to face, hungry for confirmation of his assertion, yet laughing at the idea that there could be two opinions about such a self-evident fact. And all the time he looked a ghastly shadow of the bright Horace of a year before. He had turned to Sissy as she spoke, and now stepped towards her. ' You don't look very well,' he said, commiserating her from the height of his own complete recovery. ' What is the matter with you ? ' She hung her head. ' I don't know. I think it's the weather.' ' The weather ! ' smiled Horace, as who"], [31, "THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER. \\J should call attention to the mad fancies of invalids. ' What is amiss with the weather, pray ? Tolerable for foggy old England, isn't it ? ' Sissy murmured some reply. Percival, who leant against the chimney-piece, looked up as she spoke, and the momentary glance photographed a little picture for ever on his memory. The cloud, of which Laura had spoken, had rolled upwards, blotting the azure of the sky, and the great cedars were dark as thunderstorms against the grey. In the melancholy oriel stood Horace and Sissy, if indeed they were Horace and Sissy, and not the ghosts of their beautiful sunshiny selves, with the ghost of the sunshiny morning in the background. They looked at each other with strange eyes. What change had come over them during the last year ? Horace had a constrained and watchful air, and Sissy shrank sadly from his look and touch. And these were the two who had been like brother and sister together in glad old days at Brackenhill. '. Listen ! ' said Laura, ' I hear papa and Willie.' And when the two came in, soon followed by Mr. Falconer, there were such surprised exclamations, such questioning and such wonder, on the part of the new-comers, VOL. II. c"], [32, "' FOR PERCIVAL.' 18 such quick assertions of perfect health on Horace's part, that it did not signify whether Sissy talked or not. Presently she stole across the room to Percival where he stood. ' Have you spoken to William Falconer yet ? ' she asked in an eager whisper. ' Spoken to Falconer ? ' ' About the pony I am to ride \u2014 the pony from the Rectory. Laura said he would go for it' ' But, my dear child, we don't want the pony now. What are you thinking of ? Of course you will drive home in the brougham with Horace.' ' No, no, I don't want to drive. I would rather ride with you \u2014 much rather, Percival.' There were timid caresses in her voice, and almost tears. 'And I should like to ride with you,' said he. ' But we can't ask for the pony for a mere whim, though we might have done so when we were really in a difficulty.' ' This morning,' she pouted, hanging her pretty head, ' you wanted our ride to go on for ever and ever, you told me.

' No, I needn't,' said Sissy. ' If you won't get me the pony, I can stay here for the night. Laura will keep me ; she said she would.' ' Impossible ! ' Percival was growing stern.

' Very well, then ; I will drive home, since you say I must. But you must drive too.'

Percival smiled and talked ; but there was a threaten ing gravity about his eyes. The brougham came to the door, and the three drove off. The pleasure of being together had been secured with some diffi culty, yet they scarcely seemed to appreciate each other's society. Horace leaned back, evidently tired, though he did his best to conceal the fact.

Their hearts and brows were burdened so heavily that it was almost a wonder that the sleek chestnuts should whirl them so gaily along the road to Brackenhill. Some thing might have been done to lighten the load, no doubt, had the trio been able to make up their minds. Horace need not have uttered a word, he might have pulled a letter from his pocket which his hand instinctively sought, and he would have fronted the world once more, with never a secret to hide. Sissy need only have opened her lips to let out a confused and hurried avowal, which sometimes seemed as if it must force its way in spite of her. But Percival, if he had a share of his own in this oppression, must have opened his heart to seek it, and might have been startled had a phantom taken shape, and come forth from its inmost recesses to look him in the face.

It was impossible to prepare her for the shock, and Horace saw her sud denly blanched cheeks, and met her with the more defiance. It seemed as if the happy brightness of the morning could not belong to the day which closed so drearily. Everybody longed to hasten the lagging hours.

When he was put out he looked like a thunder-cloud. Nor did he weaken the effect of his expression by speech, and his politeness was terrible. But Horace was not displeased with her, and when he coughed, her eyes, as she turned them away, were full of sorrow. When he sat by the fireside she silently pushed him a footstool, and crept behind his chair to draw a curtain closer, lest there should be a draught. She remembered every fancy he had about his tea. Yet she hardly spoke to him, nor did she touch him as she gave him his cup. Mr. Thorne stood on the hearth-rug, and surveyed the party.

' Oh ! of course ! ' Aunt Harriet sank back relieved, only to exclaim the next moment, ' Percival ! the parrot doesn't wear a silk dress !

She sat down on the sofa, and it creaked a little ; her stiff black silk, with its violet satin trimming, swept over Mrs. Middleton's lap. The little, delicately apparelled old lady was engulfed and fondled. Mrs. James Thorne was fifty-four. She called herself forty-three, and always spoke as if she had been very young indeed at the time of her marriage, six-and-twenty years before. ' A mere chit \u2014 just out of the school room ; I ought to have been in it a good deal longer, I'm afraid, so learned as people are nowadays.

' Goodish-sized pony, wasn't it ? / remember it.' She thought it was. ' Yes, yes,' he repeated, apparently medi tating, 'nice pony.' He seemed to call the points of the imaginary animal to remem brance. ' Didn't your father get him from Jack Lawson ? ' he asked suddenly ; ' you remember Jack Lawson ?' (Rumour had linked Mr. Lawson's name with Miss Benham's from one end of the county to the other, while James Thorne was still a white-faced little schoolboy.) ' Oh, yes ! ' she said, looking him full in the face ; ' I recollect him, of course. Little black man, wasn't he ? ' This was very creditable \u2014 Mr. Jack Law son having been big and sandy-haired. Ap proval dawned in the Squire's eyes. 'Exactly!' he said, and added thought fully, ' a good memory is one of the greatest of blessings when one is advancing in years.' She was rather perpkpxed. Mrs. James was not a bad-looking woman. From her girlhood onward she had always been somewhat too high-coloured and strongly built for beauty ; but her features were re-"], [49, "A THORN IN THE FLESH. 35 gular and her figure good. She might have made a grand Amazon ; but her affectation of juvenility, her sentimental reminiscences and insinuating smiles, were hideously at variance with her masculine appearance. ' Hunting Harry,' as Miss Harriet Benham had been called of old, hunted now with playful glances and little sighing allusions to her youth, as if she missed it like a friend she had just lost. Percival hated her, and behaved to her with stately courtesy. ' She has such a fear ful voice,' he said one day to Sissy. ' It isn't pleasant,' said Sissy, stooping over him as he sat, and putting some violets in his coat. ' Yours is.' ' I should think hers wasn't pleasant. If they were going to hang me, and she had to pronounce sentence \u2014 which she would do with great pleasure \u2014 I think I should ask to be executed at once, and let her rasp it out at her leisure when I was beyond its reach.' ' You always speak so softly and lazily when she is near,' said Sissy, ' I think you aggravate her.' ' Do you really ?' Percival was so pleased that he sat up. ' Dear me !

' It is hard,' he allowed. ' People shouldn't be judged by voices, or noses, or complexions, or such things, of course. Take hair, for instance. I should not like to be unjust to a woman because her hair was pale drab, or because it turned grey at twenty-five, or because it was such a minute wisp that one small hair-pin would restrain the whole. I don't think our coloured brothers happy in their style of hair, but I don't blame them for it. But I am not superior to all prejudices \u2014 I admit it frankly, though with sorrow.

' You don't mind my calling you Aunt Harriet, do you ?' she says sweetly. ' Perhaps I ought to say Mrs. Middleton; but didn't my poor dear James always call you Aunt Harriet ? And my own name, too, \u2014 I always feel so fond of my namesakes, as if they belonged to me some how. Don't you ?' ' I never had much to do with any name sakes of mine, except one maid,' says the old lady reflectively, ' and she had such dreadful warts on her hands ! But I was able to give her the best of characters, thank goodness ! ' ' How droll you are !' Mrs. James replies, with her head on one side. She holds a small portrait a long way off, and lifts a gold rimmed glass to examine it. ' What have you got there ? ' Aunt Harriet inquires. Mrs. James sighs, and turns the picture a little towards her companion, who puts on her spectacles, and peers curiously at it. It is a painting on ivory of Maurice Thorne, the Squire's favourite son, who was drowned so many years ago. ' Good gracious ! Maurice's miniature out of the library !

' Godfrey will not scold me \u2014 I am not afraidA says the old lady, with quivering emphasis. She is almost boiling over with suppressed indignation at the idea of Mrs. James defending her from her brother. Her kniting progresses in a jerky manner, and she has not discovered that she has dropped a stitch in the last row. ' It would be odd if Godfrey and I didn't understand each other. And you must pardon me, but I don't quite see your particular interest in Maurice.' ' In poor dear Maurice ?

I saw it somewhere, and I said, \"How very true!\" One must feel a little difficulty towards him, I think, though one cannot feel quite as lie would wish.'

What does this woman mean ? That Maurice \u2014 Maurice- Oh, it is too much ! (' My dear,' she said afterwards, ' if I had spoken I must have screamed at her ! ') Mrs. James, still with the portrait in her hand, sighs, half smiles, and puts up her eyeglass for another survey. ' So like ! ' she murmurs. Handsome Maurice, trim and neat in the fashion of thirty years ago, looks out of the miniature frame with wide clear eyes, and proudly curved mouth. One might fancy an expression of scornful appeal on the delicately painted features, as if he saw the coarsely complexioned, middle aged face leaning over him, and exclaimed, ' Mate me"], [54, "' FOR PERCIVAL. 40 with her!' She turns the bright young fellow a little more to the light, and dusts him pensively with her lace-edged handkerchief. ' Curious ! ' she says.

I've got him in a brooch. It must have been done when he was about the same age, I should think.' ' I dare say I'm a stupid old woman,' says Aunt Harriet, who has compressed a multitude of mistakes into a row or two of her work, and is going fiercely on, ' but I don't quite see what was curious. One of them was pretty sure to be handsomer than the other, unless they were twins, and you couldn't tell which was which.' ' Dear Aunt Harriet \u2014 how practical she is!'

Her companion darts a keen glance at her, as if suspecting a hidden sarcasm, but the old lady is examining her knitting with newly aroused curiosity, and seems startled and innocent. Mrs. James covers half Maurice's face with her hand and gazes at the forehead, partly shaded with silky dark hair. ' Doesn't it remind you a little of our dear Sissy ? ' she says. ' Sissy ! Why should it be like Sissy ? Why there wasn't a drop of the same blood in their veins ! ' ' It reminds me of her,' Mrs. James persists.

' I don't see it,' she says ; ' and I saw Sarah Percival two or three times, and thought her a hand some girl.' ' So she was,' says the Squire, opening the door. ' What's the joke ? ' For Mrs. Middleton is laughing still. She has given her suppressed emotions the rein, and relieves them in this manner, while her companion sits by her, amazed and half offended at the outburst. She cannot answer for a moment, and meanwhile Mr. Thorne has taken the miniature from Mrs. James in a matter-of-fact way, which does not admit of the threatened apology.

' Horace won't stay very long.' ' That is why I must, I think. We don't want him to get into trouble, do we ? My grandfather would take my part, right or wrong, and we should break Aunt Harriet's heart.' ' Yes \u2014 go,' hanging her head sadly. ' It will only be for a few days. Don't look so mournful ; you'll have enough of me soon, believe me.' ' I wish I were sure of that,' she answered, in an eager whisper. ' Wish you were sure you would be tired of me one of these days ? Well, that's a droll wish, you strange child. Look up, and tell me what you mean by it.' ' I mean I want all of you, I think,' and she laid her head on his shoulder. Percival was silent for a moment. She was his darling, his pride. At a word, a glance, he would have laid down his life for her. But as she spoke it flashed upon him that she possessed but a small portion of that life. What multitudes of thoughts, fancies, longings, memories, had gone to make up the five-and-twenty years of his existence ! Some of them were dim floating phantoms,"], [61, "WHAT IS LOVE ? 47 which would be transformed if they were clothed in any words whatever. And there were political day-dreams of Reform (general \u2014 and with a big R), and dreams of some thing beyond politics \u2014 of the future of Humanity (with a big H). How could he explain these to Sissy ? She would be bewildered, if indeed her soul, fenced and pure, did not shrink from some of his unfettered aspirations after good. She knew a little of the ordinary level of his life, but he knew of thoughts which had risen high above it, when his soul was drawn like a mighty tide God-ward, and of thoughts which had sunk far below it. Could he have told her of the first, she would have thought him a miracle of perfection. Could he have told her of the last, the red which mounted to his brow would have stained her whiteness with shame. In neither case would she have better understood him, rather, fatally misun derstood him. If he could not truly possess those lofty impulses, neither was he truly possessed by the lower ones. Must it always be so between man and woman, he wondered, as he stood with his arm about Sissy. Or was the fault in her or in him self ? Did he even know himself ? What dim abysses of thought would open in his"], [62, "48 'FOR PERCIVAL.' mind sometimes, as he lay in wakeful mid- night dreams ! What unexpected fancies would spring up and blossom in his brain ! Could one human being ever know another ? Hardly \u2014 but then what was love ? Perhaps only a germ of divination here, which should ripen into knowledge in a far-off eternity. He could fancy Judith Lisle, for instance, reading his soul in some new and more transparent life, and if it were a purer soul, which had no need to flinch, he thought it would be a pleasant thing to be penetrated by that quiet gaze. Man's isolation here might be unavoidable, but something in the shadowy loneliness of thought rather reminded him of the dusky gloom in which a cuttle-fish shrouds itself from unwelcome pursuers. He liked to fancy Judith . . . Judith! And all the while his arm was round Sissy's waist ! ' My dear child,' he said hurriedly, ' take the best of me \u2014 you don't want all. You looked charming the other night in those pearls my grandfather gave you. All the better that you were content with the pearls, and did not insist on taking the fish and the shells in your pocket.' She laughed, drawing closer to him. Then she smiled, then she sighed. ' Give me just what you like, Percival ; it will"], [63, "WHAT IS LOVE ? 49 always be more than all the rest of the world put together.' He kissed her. 'What have I done to deserve all this ?' he said. And he went away, musing, to announce his approaching de parture to his grandfather. He had only hinted at the cause in his talk with Sissy. He had had something very like a quarrel with his cousin that morning. Horace, lying back in an easy chair, had attacked him as he stood in his favourite attitude on the rug, reading the Times. He had answered lightly at first, refolding his paper and beginning a fresh column; but Horace had persisted in pouring forth fresh reproaches, interrupted from time to time by his terrible fits of coughing. Those coughing fits were more eloquent than words could have been. Percival, glancing at him, thought that he had never before realised the full sig nificance of the medi\u00e6val ' Dances of Death.' It would hardly have seemed strange or un natural had he seen a skeleton leaning, with dry arms folded, on the back of the chair in which Horace lay, disputing about his rights and wrongs. He could even fancy how the spectre, before putting out his bony hand, would look at him over his cousin's head, as much as to say, ' You and I understand all VOL. 11. e"], [64, "50 ' FOR PERCIVAL. about it, don't we ? But won't he be surprised when I eh?' And without any such ghastly imaginings, the contrast between the two young men was terrible enough. Per cival could see it, for he had turned round, and stood nearly facing the mirror, where his reflection confronted him, erect, strong, with a pleasantly defiant look of health and well being. Though he was always pale rather than otherwise, there was a slight colour on his cheek, not a mere surface tint, but showing that the blood coursed warmly beneath the olive skin. His lips were red, his glance was bright, as if he were darkly glowing with abundant life. And Horace lay back in his chair, frail, slim, and bloodless, chafing his transparent hands. He had a beauty of his own ; his eyes were almost painfully bril liant, and two spot of vivid pink flushed the whiteness of his face. How could Per cival do anything but listen to him with the gentlest patience ? Yet he was sorely tried. It is not pleasant to be taxed with wronging a man behind his back, and playing Jacob's part, especially when poor Esau has not been hunting and enjoying himself, but was sent to the south of France for a last chance. ' Don't let us quarrel, Horace,' Percival had said. ' Yes, what you say is true enough."], [65, "WHAT IS LOVE ? 51 When I came here first, five or six years ago, many a fellow in your position would have made himself uncommonly disagreeable, and you didn't. You met me almost like a brother. You maybe sure I shall remember that' ' I don't want your memory,' sneered Horace from his chair; ' I want justice.' ' Be just then,' Percival replied, with as it were a hint of inflexibility in his tone. ' Is it not right and natural that I should be often at Brackenhill during this last winter, Sissy being to me \u2014 what she is ? ' ' Oh, it was all Sissy, no doubt,' said Horace, and then there was a prolonged pause. Percival stood by, watching the slender frame shaken by the terrible cough. He had an absurd feeling, as if he were ashamed of himself, when he saw Horace struggling with it, and then leaning back utterly spent and feeble, with the painful flush brighter than ever on his cheeks. It seemed to him that he, being so strong and well, ought to have borne the pain, instead of the poor fellow who looked up after a moment, took his handkerchief from his lips, and tried to go on. ' This was my home once,' he said, ' you can't deny it. And how I haven't a home I suppose, for God knows this is none.

Well, Percival, I suppose you'll enjoy it \u2014 I shouldn't' ' Horace, listen to me. I can't stand this.' He felt, as he spoke, as if it were rather mean to overpower his cousin's feeble utterance with his strong voice. ' Of course I have been here oftener of late \u2014 it was only natural. But as to my attempting to supplant you, or doing anything behind your back that I wouldn't have done with you here, you know perfectly well it isn't true \u2014 or you would know if you were more yourself 'Stop,' said Horace, as the other turned away. ' If it isn't true \u2014 prove it.' ' Prove it ! ' said Percival, with his head high in the air. ' Say, once and for all, that you are not trying for Brackenhill. Say you'll not take it even if he offers to leave it to you \u2014 he has no right. Of course, if I died, that would be another thing. But swear you'll not have it while I live.'"], [67, "WHAT IS LOVE ? 53 Percival spoke instinctively. ' No, I'll not swear either way.' ' Then we'll fight it out,' said the feeble voice from the arm-chair. ' To the bitter end, as they are so fond of saying now.' ' Fight \u2014 nonsense ! ' Percival answered. 'I'm not going to fight you, my dear fellow, nor you me. You see everything awry to-day. I say I won't make any promises. I hate pro mises \u2014 attempts to make a moment eternal, bonds which are never needed unless they chafe. So I won't pledge myself to anything definite, and you instantly take it for granted that I am pledged to cheat you.' ' Put all that stuff about promises into a magazine article \u2014 I needn't read it,' said Horace, aiming at a cool and scornful de meanour. ' I only want to know what you mean.' ' I have told you.' ' Percival, it is my right, and you know it,' the invalid exclaimed. For a moment Per cival almost hesitated. The excessive anxiety which was visible on his cousin's face sur prised him, and touched him with the kind of pity which makes a man's heart ache, while he can hardly repress a smile. Here was this poor dying fellow in agonies about his inheritance, when in all probability his grand-"], [68, "' FOR PERCIVAL.' 54 father would outlive him. It was as if a prisoner, ordered out for execution, should be anxious about having a particular dinner awaiting him, done to a turn, in case a re prieve should arrive on the scaffold. Why not humour the sick man in his whim ? No \u2014 he hated promises. His prudence forbade him to set foot in a labyrinth of which he had not the clue. ' It is my right,' Horace repeated. ' And I have my grandfather's word.' ' You have his word ? ' ' Yes \u2014 on one condition, that is. ' What condition ? No, I have no busi ness to ask that. If you have kept it ' ' No fear of my not keeping it,' said Horace, with something like triumph in his eyes. ' If you have his word, what more can you want ? ' ' You know you can turn him round your finger,' Horace answered. ' Well, you must do your worst. From this time forward I shall know what I have to expect. We'll fight it out' ' No, we won't do anything of the kind.' ' Which means,' said Horace, 'that I shall fight openly, and you'll fight with professions of friendship. As you please.'"], [69, "WHAT IS LOVE ? 55 It would have been nearly impossible not to think that these terrible coughing fits came at very convenient times. But it was quite impossible not to perceive their painful reality. Percival was silenced again. ' Most likely you'll win \u2014 I'd advise any one to back you,' said Horace hoarsely. There was something grotesque, and almost terrible, in the feeble obstinacy which clung ever to the one thought. ' Only you'll know now that, winning or losing, you have nothing to expect from me. You quite understand ?' His eyes glittered, as he looked up at his cousin. He seemed determined to fix a quarrel on him. ' You won't expect any further friendship.' Percival had been gazing thoughtfully into the mirror again, until Horace was able to speak. Perhaps that accounted for the quiet answer. 'We won't discuss our friendship now. I quite understand that I am to expect nothing but high tragedy till further notice. I prefer something not quite so much beyond me, for my everyday life ; so I think I'll say good-bye for the present.' 'You may sneer,' said Horace, 'but I mean what I say.' 'So do I,' said Percival.

GODFREY HAMMOND ON BIRD-CATCHING. An evening or two later Percival walked into Godfrey Hammond's room, to its owner's great surprise. ' I thought you were at Brackenhill,' he said. ' So I was, till Saturday.' ' Come up to get things ready ?.' ' Come up for a little peace, and to leave a little peace there. Mrs. James is too fond of me.' ' What ? ' said Hammond. ' Oh, it's all right,' Percival replied ; ' she is much too fond of me, to my face. But she makes it all even when my back is turned.' ' So you have left her in possession ?' ' Well, I came to the conclusion that the same house couldn't hold us, unless it were a good many sizes bigger than Brackenhill. And I couldn't take her by the shoulders and turn her out of it, as it wasn't mine.' ' H'm,' said Godfrey. ' How does she get on with the Squire ?'"], [72, "58 'FOR PERCIVAL. ' Charmingly. He sees right through her, and she is blissfully unconscious of it.' ' And what is she like to look at ?' said Hammond. ' I don't believe I've seen her for twenty years.

' Well, for a woman of her age, she is handsome now, for those who like the sort. Only she comes marching along in a \" Who comes here ? A grenadier\" fashion, and when the story ought to go on with a good wholesome pot of beer, or something equally matter of fact, you get a dose of stale rosewater senti ment in a rasping voice.' ' And is she very fond of the Squire?' Percival nodded. ' Fonder than she is of me, and that's saying a good deal. As com plimentary as \u2014 as \u2014 what shall I say ? \u2014 as a testimonial to someone you never want to see again.' ' Ought not you to be looking after things a little ? ' The young man smiled. ' Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird,' he said. ' That's Solomon, isn't it ? Well, I dare say it may be true enough \u2014 of birds. I"], [73, "GODFREY HAMMOND ON BIRD-gATCHING. 59 never tried it, but I can fancy a knowing old bird watching the process of spreading the net with lively interest, and its head very much on one side, and then ungratefully flying off to an unattainable tree. But if he meant it for men, I deny it utterly. It is just the net that a man sees that he walks straight into. He can't leave it alone and go away. He must show everyone how plainly he sees it, and how perfectly he understands the principle on which the snare is arranged, and how very much closer he can venture in safety than anyone else could. In fact, there is really 710 danger for him. And the next thing you know, there he is, right in the middle of it, explaining that he always meant to walk into it and get caught, one of these fine days.' ' Very true, I daresay,' said Percival. ' But I don't think Mrs. James will do much with my grandfather. Nor do I see that Horace and I need clash in any way.' ' No ; I suppose not,' said Godfrey. He thought of Horace's father dying twenty years earlier, as Horace was dying now. ' I suppose not,' he repeated. ' He'll go abroad again before the winter comes, won't he ?

Poor Jim was a long while ill, I remember.' He rubbed his hard white hands together as he spoke, and gazed at his great signet ring, as if all the past lay hidden beneath its onyx surface. ' Godfrey,' said Percival abruptly, ' I came away partly because of Horace. He wants to quarrel with me ; he fancies I'm trying to supplant him. His thoughts are terribly set on Brackenhill, poor fellow, though what he can want with Brackenhill I hardly know. There's something ghastly in it to me, since it can only be for himself. He wanted me to swear I wouldn't take it while he lived. I hope I wasn't cruel to deny the poor fellow his fancy \u2014 if it really was a fancy, and not an excuse for a quarrel. But I hate promises I can't understand. Of course my grand father would leave it to him, that was settled ages ago. I won't do anything unfair ; he ought to know that ; but why am I to pledge myself in the dark ? '"], [75, "61 GODFREY HAMMOND ON BIRD-CATCHING. ' Mrs. James isn't dying, if Horace is, poor fellow ! ' said Godfrey. ' Perhaps she has some little scheme. Of course you were right enough, Percival, you always were a prudent young man.' Percival felt as if he coloured. He passed his hand quickly over his face. ' I'm not so sure of that' ' Not like Horace,' Godfrey went on. ' He narrowly escaped getting into the Squire's black books last year, irretrievably too, at the Agricultural Show. How time goes ! we shall have it here again directly ! ' ' What did he do ? ' ' It was those Blake girls. The Squire thought there was something between him and Addie, and he vowed he wouldn't have one of them at Brackenhill ; he'd make it into an asylum for idiots sooner.

I don't know why he should have been so furious, either ; the Blakes were better than the Benhams. But he was. I think he threatened Master Horace, and then, as it happened, they went away ; so it blew over. Where are they now ?

' Addie was worth all the others put together,' said Godfrey. Percival shook his head. That glow of pity and brotherly sympathy, which was kindled in his heart on the hillside a year before, had not died out. ' I like Lottie best,' he said simply, as he rose to go. Godfrey went out with him, asking about Mrs. Middleton and Sissy. At the head of the stairs he paused. ' Talking of old friends, did you hear that Miss Lisle's engagement was off ? ' Percival was a couple of steps below him. He flung his head back a little defiantly. ' Why, yes \u2014 months ago.' ' Ah, of course.' Godfrey lowered his voice. ' Young Marchmont was a lucky fellow to get his dismissal.' ' I don't see his luck. Rather the other way.' ' You haven't looked at this evening's paper ? ' ' No. What has young Marchmont got?' ' Nothing. But Lisle's bank has smashed, and they say he isn't to be found.'"], [77, "63 GODFREY HAMMOND ON BIRD-CATCHING. ' My God ! ' cried Percival, ' you don't mean that ! ' Hammond nodded.1 ' Bolted. March mont has had a lucky escape. I suppose it's an awful crash.' ' And Judith \u2014 Miss Lisle \u2014 how will she bear it ? If I were Marchmont \u2014 if I'd ever loved a girl, I'd give the world to have the right to stand by her at such a time as that.' ' Don Quixote ! I won't betray you to St. Cecilia,' Hammond laughed a little en viously. ' Why you are a lucky fellow too, Percival. Two or three years ago, before you came of age, he was your guardian, wasn't he ?

He so prided himself on never being in a hurry, that he was conscious of a painful loss of dignity and self-respect on such an occasion. But the afternoon after his conversation with Godfrey Ham mond, he had dashed into the station, taken a ticket for Fordborough, and leapt into the nearest carriage without a glance at its occupant. The train puffed slowly off. Even over VOL. II. F"], [80, "' FOR PERCIVAL.' 66 London the May sunlight hung like a golden glory, and, as they glided out of the station, and quickened their pace through the green fields, the sky was the deepest, purest blue. Percival did not see it. He was still discom posed, seeling in his pockets to see what he had, and what he had left behind, (as people always do when they jump in in a hurry,) and a little out of breath still. Presently he crossed his legs with a sigh of relief. After which he took off his hat, pushed back his hair, and felt better. Then the lady, who was dressed in black, and sat in the furthest corner, put up her veil, leaned forward, and said, ' Percival ! ' ' Why, Addie ! I didn't know you ! ' He moved to the seat opposite hers, and as their hands and eyes met, he thought of that evening in Langley Wood. ' I had the advantage of leisure,' smiled Addie. ' I don't suppose I should have been undetected long.' ' You are going down to Fordborough ? ' ' Yes. We hope to let our house there, and I am going down to make some final arrangements, and to bring a few things away.' ' Rather a dreary errand. You don't think of living at Fordborough any more, then ? '"], [81, "67 OF A HERMIT CRAB. ' Not at present. I hope we shall some day.' In PercivaTs state of mind it was pleasanter to question than be questioned. So he pro ceeded to ascertain that she was with Oliver, as he had supposed, and that Oliver was a dear, good, darling fellow ; that they were staying at a little seaside village, and that Oliver was thinking about a yacht. But she interrupted his questions at last. ' And how does the world treat you ? ' she asked. ' Very much as I deserve,' was the brief reply. ' So I must not complain, must I ? ' ' I don't know,' said Addie. ' I like to be treated a little better than I deserve. But I don't think you ought to complain \u2014 I may congratulate you, mayn't I ? I have never seen you since I heard \u2014 is it to be soon ? ' ' In less than a month now,' he answered, with his pleasant smile. ' I saw Miss Langton at the Agricultural Show last year,' said Addie. ' I congratulate you with all my heart, for I thought she looked charming.' Percival thanked her, with a slight inclination of his head, and a well-pleased glance. ' I suppose you are going to Brackenhill now ? Your errand ought to be a pleasanter one than mine.' F 2"], [82, "' FOR PERCIVAL.' 68 ' My errand is on a business matter, and might be pleasanter than it is.' There was a touch of bitterness in his tone.

' ' A long time ago,' she said, with a wondering smile. ' I'm Sindbad,' said Percival calmly. ' People say that everybody has a skeleton in a closet.

' ' Exactly what I say. I'm going down now expressly to invite him to get up on my shoulders.' ' Perhaps he won't,' in an encouraging tone. ' Heaven help me, if he doesn't!' exclaimed Percival. ' What would become of me ? But he will.' ' Are you quite sure that you know what you really want ? ' Addie inquired with a smile."], [83, "69 OF A HERMIT CRAB. ' Perhaps not. And in these days of restoring andbeautifying everybody's memory, I feel bound to observe, that I have studied the Old Man of the Sea, and there is much to be said for him.' ' Well, I hope you may enjoy carrying him more than you expect to do,' said Addie. Then she hesitated, consulted her watch, looked out of the window, buttoned and un buttoned her glove. ' There was something I wanted to say to you, Percival, and I shall hardly find a better opportunity.' Sindbad was forgotten in a moment. ' Say on. Is it anything you want me to do?' ' You were very good to me last year,' she said. Percival disclaimed her praise with a quick movement of his hand. ' If ever you should have reason to think me ungrateful, I want to say that it will not be that I have forgotten \u2014 I don't forget. It will be that I could not help myself. There is no knowing what may happen. I only thought I should like to say so.' Percival half smiled as he looked her in the face. ' No knowing \u2014 I think there is some knowing.

But I have had a blow, \u2014 a man whom I would have trusted with everything has just turned out a swindler. He was false all the time, when I believed him most.

' It isn't mine ; you don't know what you are asking \u2014 it isn't possible. Only some day you will think me rather mean \u2014 that's all. You trust people too much ; you think everyone is as good as yourself.' ' If there are not a good many better, the earth will soon want salt,' said Percival. ' And don't trouble yourself about my excessive trustfulness ; there's some hope of my getting rid of it at this rate, isn't there ? ' ' I wish I could say more,' sighed Addie. ' But even now I am half afraid ' ' Not of me, I hope. There's no occa sion, really. I shall just take my chance, and drift to the end of the chapter.' She looked almost wistfully at him, and sighed again, but said no more. The train rushed on through level fields, and softly swelling hills, and she watched the trailing cloud of white, which, lingering as it went, caught the sunlight for a moment on its rounded masses, before they melted into the summer air. Percival -was silent too. In spite of what he had said, he could not refrain from some wonder as to Addie's meaning. He thought of Horace \u2014 but what had Addie to do with Horace now ? He thought of Sissy \u2014 but how could these two"], [86, "72 ' FOR PERCIVAL. be sharers in a mystery ? Besides, he had made up his mind that the shadow in Sissy's life was cast by a mere cloud, not by any substantial fact. She was not well, she was low-spirited, she had fancies. She could not tell him, because she could not put a sense of grey oppression into words. Already she was better, and when he took her away, into new scenes, and among new people, all this vague grief and terror would be laughed at, or forgotten. It was impossible that there could be anything known to Addie Blake and Sissy which could seriously menace him. ' When women get a chance of talking mysteriously, they are sure to make the most of it,' thought Percival. And yet, ' some day you will think me rather mean,' was hardly like a romantic secret. There was a ring of prosaic certainty about such an anticipation as that. Percival was inclined to believe that, if the nut were cracked, some kernel of truth might be found, but he was not at all sure. He was quite sure that Addie believed there was such a kernel. But she might be mistaken, nor does every kernel, however carefully it may be planted and watered, necessarily produce a tree which will bear fruit. He had troubles of his own to think about just then, and felt disinclined"], [87, "OF A HERMIT CRAB. 73 for this nutcracking, which, if successful, would evidently get his informant into a scrape. ' No \u2014 if ever I have to think her rather mean, she shall have no chance of returning the compliment,' was Percival's final decision. And he felt a little glow of satisfaction as he came to it, which was all very well, for so far as it was not dictated by laziness, it was inspired by a courteous loyalty to Addie Blake. (It would be useless to go into the question of propor tions.) And when he had thus heroically determined not to exert himself, he leant back, and his eyes wandered over the land scape, at first with that sort of undefined pleasure and attraction which we feel when a face in the crowd recalls the face of a dear friend. Perhaps a moment later we wake to the sudden consciousness that it is our friend himself advancing to greet us. It was so with Percival. First, as he gazed absently at the country round, it brought Ford borough and Brackenhill, as it were, into the background of his thoughts. A moment later he perceived that familiar landmarks were gliding past him, and that they were close to their destination. He sprang out as soon as the train stopped, and secured a fly for Addie. ' Can't"], [88, "'FOR PERCIVAL. 74 say much for the horse,' he remarked as he came back. ' There are only three. He's an awful screw, but I don't fancy he's worse than the other two, and I rather think each of the others is.' ' I haven't far to go,' she said, as she swept along the platform in her queenliest fashion by his side. ' Remember me to Mrs. Blake and your sister when you write,' said Percival. She flashed a swift glance at him. ' I will \u2014 good bye.' He lifted his hat, and she was gone. ' Queer I should have met her after my talk with Godfrey yesterday,' thought he. ' She's handsomer than ever \u2014 I wonder if she ever cared for poor Horace. Why, she never so much as asked after him ! Can't have cared very much \u2014 and yet I don't know. There is no knowing about such things.' And shrugging his shoulders, he dismissed the matter from his thoughts, and went to the White Hart to get a dog-cart to take him to Brackenhill. A quarter of an hour later he was on his way. The soft air, the bright sunlight, the varying lights and shadows, the merry singing of the birds, the first wild roses in the hedge rows \u2014 he noted them all as he sped along the pleasant road. But his eyes were"], [89, "OF A HERMIT CRAB. 75 sombre, and the line was deeper between his brows. He had laughed about his errand to Addie Blake, but you may get laughter out of that which yields neither hope nor comfort. Laughter often goes well with bitterness, and Percival's soul was very bitter that day, as he thought of the errand on which he had come. If there was one thing he prized in the world, it was his independence. He knew well enough that it was something outside himself, no power or strength of his own. Training and temperament had conspired to make him as dependent as a girl, but he could defy them. ' I am like a hermit crab,' he had owned to himself; ' uncommonly helpless, unless I get hold of somebody's shell.' But, after all, since his grandfather the Rector had left him a handy little shell enough, he could face the world very fairly. It might have been more spacious, no doubt. Brackenhill would have been a splendid shell, delicately tinted, and lined with pearl, and our hermit crab felt that he could have filled it successfully. That, however, could not be his without two deaths, and he refrained as far as possible from thinking of such ghastly stepping-stones. He had feared, as has been already said,"], [90, "76 'FOR PERCIVAL. that his marriage might entail upon him a certain amount of dependence on his grand- father ; but through all his anxiety, there had remained to him the certainty of that little shell of his own, into which he could retire if need were, and show his claws. He was not a homeless hermit- crab, dragging himself over the sand, and so conscious of his defenceless condition, that he must accept any shell that was offered him on any terms. Sissy, by an accident of inheritance, was more splendidly housed, and together they could resist all the power of Brackenhill \u2014 a fact which took away the desire to do so. While he was assured of the necessaries of life, Percival could accept or refuse its luxuries as he pleased, and he had been treated as if he conferred a favour when he consented to take them. He felt sure he could do without the luxuries at a moment's notice, and that he could compel himself to live within a much narrower income than he possessed. For though he dead)- loved his ease, he was clear-headed and accurate in money matters, and if he lacked energy, he had considerable powers of passive endu- rance. But if he were robbed of the neces- saries of life \u2014 was there ever a hermit crab who could make himself a shell ?"], [91, "OF A HERMIT CRAB. J J Yet, in spite of all his troubles, he was conscious of an increasing pleasure as he drew near to the old manor-house. Percival had never owned to mortal being the passion he had for Brackenhill, a passion which had grown up in opposition to his will. Every stone of its walls, every bough of its trees, was dear to him. He had gone there first with the intention of scorning it, and of showing his grandfather that he scorned it. In the latter he had so thoroughly succeeded, at first in sincerity, and later through his unconquerable reserve, that the old man believed that this most treasured possession was worth but little in his favourite's eyes. It grieved him. He always felt powerless with Percival, just where he most desired to play the part of a good genius. It was his own fault, he would say to himself. He had exiled Alfred and his son, and the boy had grown up an outsider, apart from all the associations which should have been woven into his life \u2014 a Percival, and not a Thorne \u2014 rather with feelings of bitterness against the Thornes. He had done it himself, and the retribution was just. Per cival had said when first he saw his father's home that he ' liked looking at old houses.' That was all that Brackenhill was"], [92, "78 'FOR PERCIVAL. to him. The words were graven on the Squire's memory, and no syllable had been uttered which would in the slightest degree efface them. It was the deepest longing of the old man's heart that Percival might reign after him, and even if it could be, his happi ness would not be complete since his boy despised Brackenhill. ' Any other old house would do as well,' Godfrey Thorne would say with a sigh. ' Perhaps he'd sell the place if he had it, and buy another somewhere else. Only Sissy cares for it.' If anyone had come to the Squire, and told him that his grandson cared more for the old house than he did himself, he would have answered with a sad little smile of utter unbelief ; yet it would have been true. Brackenhill was the background of all Per cival's daydreams. He loved the terrace walk, with its balustrade ; the flight of steps, with mossy balls of stone on either hand ; the entrance hall, with its stately pavement of white and black ; the great staircase, down which Sissy came with light footfalls and shining eyes. Above all, he loved the long drawing-room, with its antique furniture and its lingering perfume of the roses of years gone by. Not even to Sissy had a syllable of this"], [93, "OF A HERMIT CRAB. 79 passion been breathed. Percival's role from the first had been to accept the fact that his father was disinherited as a simple matter of course, not as a punishment inflicted, but as a bargain made. All that was lost for Sarah Percival was well lost ; it was impossible to reason with her son on any other basis. He only dimly remembered her, and therefore she was a symbol of his ideal. He wore her name proudly as if it were a title. If any of the old people in the neighbourhood said, ' Ah, I remember your mother,' his eyes flashed with sudden eagerness. It seemed to him that if he owned his fondness for Brackenhill, it might be thought that in his inmost heart he regretted his father's ob stinacy. With his grandfather, above all, he had been reserved. He knew that the old man loved him, with such an absorbing passion as old people sometimes have for the favourites of their declining years. They are sadly conscious that they have no time to change, that everything around them is strange and new, and that if they drop the hand to which they cling, trembling, they will be left alone in the world, having lost the swift instinct by which heart finds heart in youth. Percival understood something of all this, and, after a fashion, he returned his"], [94, "80 ' FOR PERCIVAL. grandfather's affection. But he knew Mr. Thome's desire to be supreme, and actively to regulate the destinies of those he loved ; and, fearing his caprices, would not give a weapon into his hand, which might be turned against the giver. He had kept him at arm's length hitherto, but now the Old Man of the Sea was to have his turn. Sindbad went to meet him with a sombre face, which softened as he drew near his journey's end. For he was on the bit of road which he remembered so well, level and straight. To the right, the wide meadows sloped gently down till they reached the river, and you caught the silver flash of water through the willows. To the left lay a long succession of low, rounded hills, or one long hill, for it was difficult to distinguish any particular emin ences in the ever-varied undulations. And a little way up the ascent stood Brackenhill, a long, low pile of grey, warm on its southern slope, with its park, and its stately trees, and shaven lawns about it. Behind it rose the treeless and unchanging downs, tufted with gorse and bracken, grassy, sunlit, and still. Percival felt his heart leap up, and then sink within him, as they turned in at the gate."], [95, "81 CHAPTER VII. OF CONFESSION. It is not pleasant to own to faults or follies, even though there may be a certainty of relief when the ordeal is over. Of course some confessions are worse to make than others. I suppose the difficulty ought to be exactly measured by the amount of guilt, or foolish ness, but I do not at all think it is. A Greek brigand would probably own to an additional murder or two more easily than a pattern Sunday scholar, in his first place, would confess that he had been overcome by the loose change in his master's till. Nor does it depend on the kindness of our listener. Sternness may give us a defiant strength ; gen tleness may add a keener sting to our pain. I incline to think that the real question is \u2014 Will he be surprised ? Confession is intolerable unless it is met half way. Better be understood at once, even VOL. II. G"], [96, "82 ' FOR PERCIVAL. if you are overwhelmed with reproaches, than have laboriously to draw down the storm by explanations. One may give one pull to a shower-bath string in December \u2014 but to have to take pains to get it to work properly ! And, let the hearer be as kind as he will, sympathy is impossible till surprise is overcome ; the one must subside before the other can flow. Now sympathy should answer to the appeal, as the note answers to the finger of the musician ; if delayed, it jars. Therefore, if you have acquired a cha racter for headlong impetuosity, you may go with a light heart (comparatively speaking), and own to some thoughtless action, from whose consequences you want to be delivered. It will be unpleasant, but not half so unplea sant as if you had to explain that you had missed your life's golden opportunity through a suspicious timidity. Now Percival had to make a confession which would cause the greatest surprise among his friends. It was not a crime, it was only an imprudence. But at Brackenhill the words Percival and prudence were supposed to be synonymous. He might well have that apprehensive line between his brows. Hither to the hermit crab had shown his claws in a lofty and defiant manner, and had been"], [97, "83 OF CONFESSION. considered rather a formidable animal than otherwise. But he felt very helpless and miserable as he dragged himself to Bracken hill, to own that he had lost his shell. The old butler received him very graciously, and told the footman to take out Mr. Percival's portmanteau. ' I haven't any luggage,' said Percival with a smile. (It seemed to him that it was a very sickly smile, and he resolved to try and do better the next time there should be any occasion for one. But really, he reflected, smiling was very difficult.) ' Are they all at home ? ' he inquired. Duncan explained that there was no one at home, except the Squire. Mrs. Thorne had gone up to town for the day, and would not return till late, perhaps not till the next morning. Mr. Horace had gone to Mr. Garnett's to dine and sleep ; and Mrs. Middleton and Miss Langton dined early, and had ordered the pony-chaise, saying that they should call on Miss Falconer, but would be back in the evening. ' It's all right, said Percival. ' It is my grandfather I want to see. Is he in the library ? I'll go.' He took a step, and then hesitated. ' No, tell him I am here.' He turned into the drawing-room, and G 2"], [98, "84 ' FOR PERCIVAL. stood on the hearthrug. He drew himself up to his full height, and held his head all the more proudly that he should have to bend it soon. He gazed almost wrathfully at the portraits on the walls, at the quaint old-fashioned furniture, at the treasures of old china \u2014 things comparativly worthless to untaught eyes, but speaking plainly to him of the patient accumulation of many years. Because he prized them, they irritated him. How many generations of Thornes had lived at Brackenhill in a sort of stewardship, guarding these things, adding to them, and bequeathing them to their successors ! There had been Thornes who were wasteful, and encumbered the estate with mortgages, but somehow they had struggled on. Nothing had ever been sold. Percival was angry, because he understood the delicate charm of all around him. He could scorn vulgar splendour, but not these possessions, which were honourable in his eyes, like an old name. ' How was I ever to be independent ? ' he said to himself. ' Why wasn't I taught to laugh at it all, and shipped off to keep sheep in Australia, like that Wingfield boy who used to play with Lottie Blake ? He likes it well enough, I'll be bound ; and he'll fall on his feet anywhere, while I .' And the tall"], [99, "85 OF CONFESSION. young fellow, with his proud face and stately air, looked down at his hands, and could almost have groaned. He knew very well what beautiful hands they were \u2014 smooth, olive-skinned, and useless. His grandfather came up the room with a quick, nervous step, and an expres sion of unmistakable anxiety in his eyes. What did this sudden visit mean ? For a moment he scanned his favourite as if he seared some accident might have happened, and Percival might have arrived, like a Chelsea pensioner, with much glory and a scarcity of limbs. But there was no sign of any such calamity, as the young man advanced a step or two to meet him ; and when the Squire saw his defiant manner, and met his glance, he said to himself that somehow he had offended Percival. It was a relief to him that his grandson shook' hands with him. Just for that moment more the hermit crab looked very formidable indeed. ' Sissy is out,' said the old man. ' If she had known ' ' Perhaps it's just as well,' Percival re plied. ' I wanted to speak to you, if you are not busy.' The other shook his head. ' No \u2014 what is it ? '"], [100, "86 ' FOR PERCIVAL. ' Have you looked at the paper this morning ? ' Now the Squire had been reading the Times in the library before luncheon, and had been very much astonished at the Lisle catas trophe. He had said to his sister, ' Just look there ! That is the man Alfred trusted, when he wouldn't trust his own father ! Left Per cival in his charge ; I wasn't fit to take care of the boy \u2014 oh, no ! A pretty sort of guar dian, eh ? If this had happened three or four years earlier, where would that money be ? ' But Percival's arrival had so alarmed him, that the whole thing had gone out of his head. ' Yes \u2014 why, yes,' he said. He began to wonder how Percival could have got into the paper, and how he could have missed the paragraph. The wildest ideas went hurrying through his brain. The boy couldn't have gone and married someone within three weeks of the wedding-day ? It was a comfort that there was no lady visible. Or accidentally made an end of someone ? ' I looked at the paper \u2014 yes, certainly,' said the Squire, trem bling with an.xiety. Did you see anything about Mr. Lisle ? ' Percival demanded. ' Lisle ! Oh, yes, of course. What an"], [101, "87 OF CONFESSION. abominable affair ; and what a consummate rascal the fellow must be!' He pulled up suddenly. It was possible that Percival might have something to say in defence of his father's friend ; but the young man made no sign. ' Why, as I was saying to your Aunt Harriet, if this smash had come three or four years earlier, he might have ruined you.' ' He has ! ' ' Eh ? ' said the Squire, blankly. 'He has!' Percival saw the truth, which he had de livered like a violent thrust, slowly making its way through the barriers of preconceived ideas. He saw the faint gleam of triumph dawning in the old man's eyes \u2014 of triumph and pleasure that could not be altogether disguised. For a moment he almost hated his grandfather. ' Ruined you \u2014 he has ruined you ! Per cival, do you really mean it ? ' Percival bent his head. ' And you were always so wise in money matters ! ' said the Squire, with a kindly smile of amusement. ' What \u2014 did he swindle you too ? Told you of some very special invest ment, eh ? How much per cent, were you to have, Percival ? '"], [102, "88 ' FOR PERCIVAL. ' I wasn't worth so much trouble. He had nothing to do. Only we never had a settlement when I came of age.' ' Never settled matters then ! How on earth did that happen ? ' ' I should advise you to adopt the theory that I was a fool,' said Percival bitterly. ' It will work very well.' The old man was not offended at the young fellow's sullen manner. It would have been difficult for Percival to have offended him. He was ready to be a partisan, had it been a case of murder, or marriage, as in his first wild fancy. ' Ah, well \u2014 what does it matter? ' he said, rubbing his hands, and looking eagerly up at the other's face. ' If that old swindler had done no more harm to anyone than he has done to you, one might forgive him.' ' He has taken all I had,' was Percival's dull reply. ' Hardly. For he hasn't taken all / have. Come, my boy, there's nothing to look so grave about. What was it ? \u2014 But never mind.' Godfrey Thome's eyes were glistening with gratification. Seven-and-twenty years earlier his son Alfred had defied him, and defied him successfully. He had inflicted"], [103, "89 OF CONFESSION. the heaviest punishment in his power, he had lavished his deepest tenderness ; but Alfred first, and then Percival, had held aloof, giving him to understand that they did not fear his anger, and did not stand in need of his kind ness. He had felt that he was beaten, though he could not bear to acknowledge it. And now all at once came his moment of triumph ; his boy was there to seek his help ; he was head of his house once more. ' No matter,' he said. ' While I live you will hardly want, I think ; and when I die you will have Brackenhill.' Percival looked him full in the face in grave surprise. ' Perhaps you will get to like the old place,' his grandfather went on. ' I think you will, if you give it a fair trial. There have been Thornes here a long while. Sissy likes it very much \u2014 ask her. Of course I don't want to bind you in any way, but it is a good house, you know. If you gave it a fair trial ' ' What are you talking about ? ' said Percival. ' I say that when I die you will have Brackenhill.' ' And I say No.' The other's face fell. ' You mustn't cross"], [104, "90 FOR PERCIVAL. me in this,' he said. Was it possible that even now the cup should be dashed from his lips ? ' What do you mean ? You are the eldest \u2014 you are the heir.' ' Horace is your heir,' said Percival. ' If he had done anything to forfeit his position, it would be another thing. But he has been brought up, from the first, in the belief that he was to succeed you, and it would be the height of injustice to make any change now.' ' And how about the injustice to your father and yourself ? ' Percival's head went up. ' We accepted your terms. I see no injustice there.' ' But surely you will not deny my right to do what I will with my own.' Do you mean ' ' Of course you can do what you like with it,' said the young man. ' If you choose to rob Horace, I can't prevent it. But I needn't be a party to the robbery.' Thus the hermit crab showed his claws. ' And if it were that or nothing ? No ! Percival, no ! I was only joking.' For a sudden fire had flashed in Percival's dark eyes. 'You are judging me hastily too. How do you know Horace has not done any thing to justify this ? ' ' Simply because he told me he had not."], [105, "OF CONFESSION. 91 He said that you had exacted a promise from him, and that he had kept it, and would keep it.' Did he tell you what that promise was ? ' No.' Shall I ? ' As you please.' ' You must not trust Horace,' said Thorne deliberately. ' I would stake my life on his truth,' was the hot reply. ' So would I have done \u2014 once \u2014 and lost it. The promise he made in the morning was broken before night. But he has never owned it.' ' There must be some mistake \u2014 I can't believe it,' said Percival. The old man shook his head. ' I have proof enough, if proof were needed. It was last summer when you were both here ' ' At the Agricultural Show ? ' ' Yes. If you want to be very exact, it was the second day of the show. I had heard some talk the day before about Horace and Miss Adelaide Blake, and it didn't please me \u2014 an underhand flirtation with one of that man's daughters, and that vulgar gossip, Lydia Rawlinson, to tell me of it, giggling all the time to think how nicely I had been kept in the dark ! '"], [106, "92 ' FOR PERCIVAL. ' You didn't prefer her word to Horace's, I hope ? ' ' No. I spoke to Horace and told him that I didn't care about old Blake and his British Flour, and I didn't choose that he should have anything to do with Miss Ade laide. And he said there was nothing in it at all, and that, though he liked her very well, he didn't care if he never saw her again.' Percival's eyes were lighted with eager attention. ' He would make me any promise I liked, but he assured me none was needed, and he half laughed as he said it, as if the idea was absurd. And he finished by inquiring whether he might bow if he met her, as he would rather not be rude.' ' And you told him \u2014 ' That I didn't mean he should do any thing ungentlemanly, of course, but anything more than the merest politeness would be at his peril, for, if I detected anything under hand, I had done with him for ever. And he stood up before me, as boldly as you are standing now, still with that sort of half smile, as if I were the most unreasonable old fellow on the face of the earth ever to have had such a suspicion, and said, \" On my honour, sir, Addie Blake is nothing to me, and never will be.\" \"Very good,\" I said, \"you are"], [107, "OF CONFESSION. 93 warned, and you may go.\" And, between nine and ten that very night, my gentleman was walking with her in Langley Wood ! ' ' Ah ! ' said Percival, looking down. ' I never told him I knew it,' said the Squire. ' What's the good ? For Harriet's sake too \u2014 there's no knowing what may happen, and why should she be tormented ? But that was an end of everything. I'm not going to quarrel about it. He thinks he has cheated me \u2014 let him. Perhaps when I die he'll find out he hasn't \u2014 that's all. Only since that time I've watched a little. What sort of hand does Miss Addie write ?

Well, Perci val, do you understand now why I don't think much of Horace ? ' ' Perfectly.' ' You are satisfied ? ' The story is most convincing,' said the young man. ' Only there is a flaw in it.

Miss Blake had a taste for moonlight walks, I see, but on that particular evening I know who was her companion.' ' Silas Fielding was mistaken,' said Per cival. The old man started. Silas Fielding! Oh, you have heard, then ! Did Horace ' 'Why, I was there. He mistook us in the moonlight.' ' No \u2014 no, it is impossible. No one could mistake you \u2014 you are not a bit alike. I don' know why you want to screen Horace.' Percival produced a bunch of keys from his pocket, and singled out a small one. ' Not a bit alike ? ' he said. ' Think of Horace, and look in the glass,' was the answer. He unlocked a desk on a side table, and came back with a carte de visite in his hand. ' Whose photograph is that ? ' he asked. Mr. Thorne had half forgotten Tom Fel ton's attempt and its result, but he did recollect that there was something curious about a photograph of one of the boys. Apparently this was Percival, so he concluded that a trap was laid for him, and that it was"], [109, "OF CONFESSION. 95 really Horace. But his perplexity was not diminished. If he said ' Horace's,' it could not be denied that there was a strong likeness between the photograph and the man who stood before him. If he said ' Yours,' he might be told he was mistaken. He said, ' I don't know.' ' Well,' said Percival, ' we must be rather alike if you can't tell which sat for that. And we are. The colouring is altogether different, but the outline is very nearly the same, and a year ago the resemblance was much greater. I have reasons for remembering that evening, and I do remember it. I went with Miss Blake on an errand of which she had no need to be ashamed \u2014 but the reverse. Silas Field ing came upon us suddenly in the wood, and was startled. He knew Miss Blake by sight, and of course he had heard the Fordborough gossip, so seeing her he expected to see Horace. And as I stood there, just the same height and general appearance, and, very likely, with that felt hat I wore slouched rather over my face, of course in the dusk he did see Horace. It is all clear enough.' ' It was dusk,' said the Squire. ' That was between half-past nine and ten ? ' ' Yes. A good deal nearer ten than half past nine.'"], [110, "96 ' FOR PERCIVAL. ' And at a quarter past ten you had come in from the garden to get a shawl for Sissy, and didn't know where Horace was. I noted the time next day when Fielding was talking, because I remembered that Horace was certainly out then. I congratulate you on your walking powers, Percival.' ' I didn't walk. I got a lift.' ' Ah \u2014 who gave you a lift ? ' ' A young fellow \u2014 I don't know his name.' The Squire could not repress a smile. ' No, no, Percival \u2014 this is Quixotic \u2014 why should you screen Horace ? I tell you I know all about it. Silas Fielding was not my only informant.' ' He was an artist, up at old Collins's farm,' said the young man, pursuing his own train of thought. ' But what does it signify ? If you have any doubt still \u2014 ask Sissy. I think she would be sure to remember; at any rate I could bring back the evening to her mind.' ' Ah, yes \u2014 and Sissy's testimony would settle it.' ' Of course,' said Percival.

But you have misjudged Horace"], [111, "OF CONFESSION. 97 cruelly. Sissy shall bear witness, and set everything straight.' ' So be it,' was the quick rejoinder. ' You accept Sissy's testimony ? She has given it already. She says that you were with her during the whole of that evening, but that she does not know what became of Horace for the greater part of the time.' ' Sissy never said that ! ' ' She did. She told me so when I went to her, directly after Silas Fielding left me.' ' She didn't understand what you asked her. It isn't possible.' ' It isn't possible that she misunderstood me. I told her that I had heard that Horace was out the evening before, that I didn't want any fuss made about it, but that I must get to the bottom of the matter, for if it were true that he had been in Langley Wood with Adelaide Blake, he would never be master here, and he knew it.' ' What did she say then ? ' ' She was agitated at first, but she persisted that you had been in the garden all the evening, she could not answer for Horace.

' That's right,' the Squire began, with an air of relief. But his grandson went on. ' I will take her word, but it must be from her own lips. If you will bring her, and she will repeat it \u25a0 \u2014 here \u2014 to my face. If you choose to bring her here \u2014 ' Godfrey Thorne understood it all, and knew that those eager trembling assurances that Percival had been in the garden all the evening would never be repeated to Percival's face. ' No, there is no need,' he said, after a moment's pause, during which he reflected that Brackenhill must surely come to his boy some day. ' There has been a mistake, I suppose, and there is nothing more to be said. I'll take your word for it. We will say no more about it, will we ? We'll let the matter rest, eh ? What do you say ? ' Percival stood with lips compressed, as if he had not heard. Mr. Thorne would willingly have been deceived to the day of his death. He was not inclined to be hard on Sissy's treachery, for several reasons. First of all, she was Sissy, and, though second to Percival, second to him alone. And then his mind refused to grasp the fact, that all his suspicions of Horace were built on the state-"], [113, "OF CONFESSION. 99 ment concerning that evening which Percival had just swept away. The year's suspicion stood, though its cause was gone. Our beliefs are not like our houses ; they do not necessarily tumble about our ears because their foundations fail, or, at any rate, they are a great deal longer about it. If Horace had not been in the wood that particular night, he had been playing an underhand game somehow. Falsehood concerning that one interview would really have been nearer justice as a whole, than that little isolated truth. The old man did not put this into so many words, but he felt it. And Sissy had been working with him, working for Percival, working in the good cause. One does not desert one's accomplices. And, finally, it was a girl's falsehood, and the old Squire was dis- posed to be lenient to women in many ways. He had no doubt as to their inferiority, and judged them by a different standard. For instance, men told lies, women told \u2014 fibs. If a man told a lie, well, you knew what to think of him. But if a woman told a fib, you shrugged your shoulders, laughed perhaps, especially if she had got the better of some one you disliked, scolded her perhaps, but thought very little more of it. It might be that he felt that a woman had a truthfulness H2"], [114, "' FOR PERCIVAL. 100 of her \"own which her white lies did not affect. Women are often referred to that indirect influence which they are supposed to exercise over things in general, and which they are assured is a sufficient right. Perhaps it was only just and logical in Godfrey Thorne, holding this idea, to wink at their attaining the indirect influence by slightly indirect means. But how about his grandson, who held that women should maintain a pure and tender ideal, to which men, amid the rough scramble of their daily life, might turn for gentle thoughts, and sweet reverence, patient en durance, and unconquerable truth ? The Squire was not quick to decipher such a creed, but some outline of it was written very plainly on Percival's face, in the features sternly set as if they were cast in bronze, and the eyes filled with surprise and indignation. ' We seem all to have been making mistakes, don't we ? ' said Godfrey Thorne. ' Silas Fielding and Sissy and I \u2014 and you with old Lisle, eh ? Suppose we let bygones be bygones, and start fresh and think no more of them ? ' ' We will talk of something else this moment, if you like, ' said Percival. ' With all my heart.'"], [115, "OF CONFESSION. 101 ' And you won't be hard on Sissy ? ' the old man persisted. ' Percival, don't look so stern, you will terrify the poor child.

Percival, don't be too angry about a mistake. We all \u2014 ' ' I think,' young Thorne interrupted him, ' that the less you and I say about this mistake of Sissy's the better.' But the Squire, who felt that he had unconsciously betrayed her, could not con trol his anxiety. ' Remember,' he said, ' it was for you.' There was a shadow on the young man's face. ' I do remember. But don't let us talk of this. Things are easily said, but no power on earth can unsay them.' And with a quick movement of his hand, as if enforcing the silence for which he asked, he turned and went to the window. He stood looking out on the terrace, trying to think, and failing signally. He was conscious only of a vague feeling of anger and helplessness, as if the earth were crack ing and failing under his feet. He dared"], [116, "' FOR PERCIVAL. 102 not speak, lest some one of the impulses which contended within him should get the upperhand, and pledge him to something definite. He had gone on his way so proudly and independently, as he thought, and all the while he had been a mere puppet in others' hands. Sissy had been scheming to enrich him, and Mr. Lisle had smilingly robbed him. But the fraud which seemed so all important that morning, as he journeyed to Brackenhill, was dwarfed by the treachery nearer home. 'Percival, I've acted very wrongly to wards you,' said the Squire from his easy-chair. Young Thorne turned round with a reluctant air. Could it be that some fresh revelation awaited him ? ' Seventy-seven. I may die any day,' said the Squire. ' So may I,' said Percival. ' Ah, but you may live fifty years.' Percival shrugged his shoulders and hardly seemed enchanted at the prospect of the half-century. ' But my time must be short, and I have risked your future. It seems to me now that I must have been mad.' Do you mean you haven't made a will ? ' 'Yes, I made one. I suppose you would be all right, if I hadn't.

Now, I have written to Hardwicke ; he is coming over next week, when these people are gone. I meant to settle everything before your marriage. I ought not to have put it off an hour. Seventy-seven \u2014 it is madness. You must not think I did not care about you ; but I wanted to be just to Horace.

' No \u2014 don't say that ; it cuts me to the heart. After all, I could make it safe for you at five minutes' warning.' ' It must be a short will,' smiled the other. The Squire got up. ' Come and see,' he said. Percival followed him to his library, and stood by while he found his keys, and laid a document out on the table. The young"], [118, "' FOR PERCIVAL. 104 man stooped, and read. Horace had a mere pittance ; Mrs. Middleton a life-interest in a sufficient sum ; Sissy a part of the family jewels ; one or two trifling legacies were left to old friends. He lifted his head when he came to the end ; it needed but three signatures to make him the future owner of Brackenhill \u2014 less than five minutes, as his grandfather had said. ' Mitchell of Stoneham made that, after the Langley Wood affair,' said the Squire. ' One day when I was out of temper with Hardwicke, I went and gave the directions. But I cooled down ; and then I didn't like the idea of righting you in an underhand way, as if I were ashamed of it, and I vowed that old Hardwicke should make the will, as he had made the others. It was natural Hardwicke should stand up for Horace,' said the old man, apologetically ; ' he has known him all his life. So I told Mitchell to let me have it, and I'd think it over.' ' I am glad,' said Percival.' ' But now I'll tell you what we'll do,' Godfrey Thorne went on. ' If you'll ring the bell, I'll sign this, and Duncan and one of the men shall witness it. Then I shall feel happy about to-day, and to-morrow I'll go over to Hardwicke.'"], [119, "OF CONFESSION. 105 ' Go to Hardwicke to-morrow by all means, but you mustn't sign this ; there's no need.

' What are you afraid of sir ? Of some accident between this and to-morrow ? Well, if there were one, God forbid that you should leave this will behind you. How could Horace accept his rights as a gift from me ? What could 1 say for myself if they taxed me with sneaking down here, while they were away, to induce you to sign a will which we both knew was a cruel injustice ? After what has been said between us to-day, I should deserve to be scouted. I would sooner break stones on the road than take a penny left me by that will ! ' ' Perhaps you are right,' said the Squire ; and he slipped the blotting-paper, with careful carelessness, over the offending document. Percival saw, and smiled. ' But, after all,' said the old man, ' what am I to do ? what am I to say to Hardwicke ? ' ' Isn't that for you to decide ? Only be just to Horace.' ' But for yourself \u2014 say what you would"], [120, "'FOR PERCIVAL.' 106 like. What would you take without all these scruples ? Ah, you have a wish \u2014 I see it in your eyes. What is it ? ' (It was the true Sultan fashion \u2014 Ask, and I will give it thee, even unto the half of my kingdom.) ' Well I have a fancy,' Percival owned. ' But perhaps you only mean an income, or a lump sum. You would not like to divide the property, even if it were but a small part ? The Thornes never have, I suppose.' Godfrey Thorne, who would have scoffed at the mere idea of such a thing ten years earlier, caught it now. Haven't they ? Perhaps not. So much the better. I'll be the one to begin.' ' Then,' said Percival, ' give me Prior's Hurst.\" It was a small place\u2014 half farm, half manor-house \u2014 about fifteen miles away, on the edge of the little wood from which it took its name. ' Give me Prior's Hurst, and a moderate income \u2014 nothing that will burden the estate \u2014 and I shall be content' ' It is an out-of-the-way place,' said his grandfather. ' How long have the Thornes had it ? ' ' Almost ever since the Reformation. We bought it of the man who got it then.'"], [121, "OF CONFESSION. 107 ' So I thought. And Brackenhill ? ' Oh, not till much later.' ' Exactly,' said Percival. ' There were Thornes at Prior's Hurst before there were Thornes at Brackenhill. Why shouldn't there be Thornes at Prior's Hurst again ? Since I am the elder, give me that.' ' And I will,' said the Squire, rubbing his hands, and looking up with a proud air of possession at his tall grandson. The solution of the problem pleased him. He was glad to do for his favourite what no Thorne had ever done, but there was some thing of unreality about the transaction ; for a little while, and the whole would surely be Percival's. The young man did not feel this so strongly. Hammond's chance remark, ' Pro bably you think him in greater danger than he really is,' had driven him to the opposite extreme. James Thorne had gone abroad for his health, had come home, had married, had lived some time ; why not Horace ? He would be careful ; he could have everything that money could buy. He would never be strong, but ' God grant he may live many years ! ' said the next heir. Percival's renun ciation of Brackenhill that day was real. ' I think I'll go and have a look at the"], [122, "' FOR PERCIVAL.' 108 garden,' he said. ' But, first/I have a favour to ask.' ' Ask it,' said the Squire. ' Will you let me burn that unsigned will ?

Well, I'll look it up ; I don't see it just this minute. I'll burn it to day or to-morrow, you may trust me.'

Percival swept away the summer finery of the grate, and laid the paper down. His grandfather watched him in silence, pushing out his lower lip, as he found a match, and knelt on the rug to light it. There was a quick rush of flame as it touched Mr. Mitchell's work, and the leaves, which might have meant so much, curled and shrivelled into useless tinder.

There was something awful and irrevocable about the deed, now that it was done. What was it that had suddenly flared into nothingness with that hot breath on his cheek ? He got up with a little flush on his face, and his eyes and lips were grave, as if he had been offering a sacrifice. His grandfather smiled. ' So much for a Quixotic piece of folly.' ' Folly ? I don't see it,' said Percival. There was a crisp rustling in the ashes at his feet. ' But I do. And I ought to know what folly is at seventy-seven. I've seen enough. Well, you are a good fellow, and your folly is better than most folk's wisdom.' The last spark died in that little black heap. Percival, who had been gazing at it, looked up.

He crossed the terrace and went down the stone steps \u2014 the terrace re minded him too forcibly of Sissy \u2014 and, plunging into the shrubbery, walked to and fro, with his head bent, and his hands behind his back. Gradually, and without conscious thought, there came into his soul, not clear ness, but a better understanding of his per plexity. He hated scenes, recriminations, quarrels. His indolence made him gentle in his man ners as a rule. Having always been strong and well, he had nothing of that irritability which is more bad health than bad temper. Consequently he wondered that he should ever be warned to be lenient in his dealings with anyone, and imagined himself very tolerant and merciful indeed. He had no idea how"], [126, "' FOR PERCIVAL. 112 stern he could look, nor how obvious it often was that he chose to yield. His grandfather's entreaty that he would be merciful to Sissy had awakened in his mind the remembrance of Aunt Harriet's exclamation when she heard of his engagement, ' You won't be hard on her, will you ? He had resented that, as he had resented the pleading of this afternoon. But, as he walked under the freshness of the green boughs, he began to understand it, for it seemed to him that he was hard. He could say much for Sissy in justification and extenuation, he could have pleaded her cause with abundance of words, he fancied he could have touched others, and yet he could not touch himself. It was like digging through a shallow soil, and striking a layer of adamant. Let him say what he would, it always ended in an eternal protest \u2014 it was a lie, and therefore to be utterly abhorred. There were many things he could have pardoned, and his pardon would have been calmly accorded and complete. A wrong done to himself, for instance. But how was any man to pardon a wrong done to Truth ? Would he not be in some sort a sharer in the falsehood which he affected to forgive ?"], [127, "SISSY ENTERS INTO KING AGAG's FEELINGS. I I 3 He hoped he was not unjust to Sissy. He would have believed she might be weak, and he counted it his right to guard and care for her, but he had never doubted her utter rectitude. And there was something mon strous to him in the idea that she should have deliberately wronged Horace \u2014 Horace, her boy playfellow and protector \u2014 Horace, who had printed little letters to her before she could read ordinary writing \u2014 Horace, who had had her childish love, and baby kisses, years before he \u2014 Percival \u2014 ever set foot in Brackenhill. And had that been all ! But she had been willing to share the spoil. He could not be unjust enough to imagine for a moment that Sissy had calculated on her own advantage in this, but such advantage should have been unendur able to her. No, he could not forgive. And yet \u2014 poor Sissy. It would appear that Balak, the son of Zippor, had great faith in a change of place, when he sought to transform a blessing into a curse. Percival did not think much of the Biblical precedent, and did not desire the same result, but he tried the experiment.

Even to that melancholy corner the glory of summer had come, had flooded it, and filled it with sunlight, and verdure, and perfume. The very moss on the pathway which had been a blackish crust shone now like greenest velvet touched with gold. The blossom's loveliness was gone, but the green of the leaf was delicately fresh. The birds were singing on the boughs, and there lingered in the cool shadows a few late flowers of narcissus solitary on their stalk, and shining like sweet white stars in the dusky gloom. Alone he stood, where they had stood together, and it is not to be denied that the locality had a certain effect. She rose up more clearly before him, in her delicate and gracious loveliness \u2014 little Sissy who had stood there, with wistful eyes uplifted to his face. He seemed to feel her soft hands on his arm, or about his neck, and a thrill ran through him at the fancy, as a thrill had run through him at the veritable touch. But, even as he softened, his lip curled in sorrowful disgust at his own weakness. Was he to yield something of his truth to the mere charm of Sissy's presence ? After all, what was the use of his"], [129, "SISSY ENTERS INTO KING AGAg'.S FEELINGS. 115 deliberations ? Their two lives were to be spent together, for if the falsehood repelled, it also bound him, since it was for him it was uttered. He would not profit by it, but he could not punish it. He had resigned his wider visions for a sweet home life with Sissy, and now the delicate bloom had been brushed off his love, and he must resign that, in its turn, for something lower. He would speak to her, since he could not pass it over in silence, but he would speak gravely and gently, and with perfect self-restraint. And perhaps in years to come at Prior's Hurst, truthfulness and trust might spring up and grow anew between them. It could not be as if wrong doing had never been, but a new faith might arise on the ruins of the old. He would be gentle. The hardness that was in him came out in the sternly accented determination of this resolve. Nothing should induce him to bandy reproaches with the girl who had fallen from truth in her desire to serve him. By his own deed he had made her his. He would not pass over what she had done, he would not deny his own ideal, far off and perfect as a star. But no words of hers should wring an angry word from him, he swore it to the blue sky, as he stood on the very spot of ground where I 2"], [130, "116 'FOR PERCIVAL. he had taken her to his heart. ' You won't be hard on her ? ' No \u2014 he would not be hard. But Percival did not consider that there are two kinds of anger which are terrible. People may be out of temper, sullen, or stammering, with swollen veins \u2014 unreasoning, unjust. These one may fear while the fit lasts, or one may feel pity or disgust, but they are the lower in our eyes for their rage. But when a man neither masters nor is mastered by his passion, when he is his indignation, a righteous wrath incarnate, neither narrow, nor human, a burning fire for which his whole nature is but fuel \u2014 that fury of the whirlwind which men have made their type of spirit \u2014 then he is terrible and great. Or, again, when a man stands before you erect and self-restrained, with anger in his eyes and resolution in the lines of his quiet mouth, measuring his words, ruling his wrath, smiling if need be, and, if need be, listening, (which is more,) he too is terrible. Who knows the depth of his indignation ? Who can say how long it may last ? For aught we can tell, there may be an eternity of anger behind his calm face.

Since his life was after a fashion stunted and spoiled, it was well that the cookery was good, and the wine chosen with especial reference to his taste. The Squire too was discoursing pleasantly enough of Prior's Hurst, and what might be done to improve the house, with pictures and old china. ' You ought to have all the family portraits,' said Godfrey Thorne ; ' as the head of the house, it would be only right.' Percival smiled, neither assenting nor refusing, but a little perplexed. It did seem to him right that he should have them. Surely such a legacy would prove to all the neighbour hood that his father had done nothing amiss, when, in his old quarrel with the Squire, he held to his word, and his heart, and Sarah Percival. But at the same time it pained him to think that he should rob Brackenhill. ' Listen,' said his grandfather abruptly, ' don't you hear wheels ?

His grandfather hesitated, looking up at him. ' You are not going to be ' he began, and stopped. Percival completed the sentence with per fect calmness, ' Hard on Sissy? Certainly not' ' Go into the drawing-room,' said the Squire with alacrity. ' How surprised she will be ! I will send her to you.' There was no time for consideration, and the matter was not worth arguing. Percival went into the drawing-room, crossing the hall as the wheels were heard crushing the gravel just outside. He opened the first book that came to hand, and read a line or two. It was impossible in those brief moments to go over his decision again, so he put it aside as a thing irrevocable and leant over the page and read \u2014 And she forgot the stars, the moon, and sun, And she forgot the blue above the trees, And she forgot the dells where waters run, And she forgot the chilly autumn breeze ; She had no knowledge when the day was done, And the new morn she saw not"], [133, "SISSY ENTERS INTO KING AGAG's FEELINGS. 119 The door opened, and he lifted himself with a studiously quiet face.

But George had hardly found a clear space for his burden, and Percival had only managed O leave the palm to wither by itself ; Let not quick Winter chill its dying hour ! when Sissy appeared in the doorway, with a questioning face.

Then she lagged \u2014 then she stood still, a few paces from Percival, looking up into his eyes. ' Percival \u2014 you know ! ' she said. ' Ah, Sissy \u2014 and you know,' he answered, with a gentle emphasis. Her hand had dropped by her side. Had she held it out to him, he would have taken it, but she was afraid.

It was an end of which he had never dreamed. He had been as confident of her clinging tenderness, as of his own protecting devotion.

It was a November night when he read her love for him in her frightened eyes, and stooped to kiss her lips.

Percival forgot his disapprobation, his tone of gentle yet studied rebuke ; he remembered only that he wanted Sissy, and that he was on the verge of losing her. ' Is this to be the end ? ' he said.

His haste, and the gathering dusk, spared him any question or scrutiny. He bade the old Squire a hurried farewell, and ran down the steps. ' Your overcoat is in,' the Squire called after him, as Percival swung himself up by the driver's side ; ' and I will see that all is made right \u2014 to-morrow.' ' Thank you,' Percival replied, waving his hand, and remembering, with an effort, that it was Prior's Hurst that was meant. The old man watched the dog-cart as it rattled down the avenue, and, even when it had disappeared, he listened to the far-off sound of the departing wheels.

Then he turned away, and the footman, who had been discreetly waiting in the background, came forward and closed the big door with a heavy sound, which went through Sissy Langton's heart. She had stolen into the drawing-room again. There was the chair he had set for her, there was the glass of wine he had poured out for her. Sissy could not endure to think that George might come in and drink that wine, it would be profanation. She touched it with her lips, but she was sure that she could not swallow it, it would choke her. She carried it to the window, and, leaning out into the sweet stillness of the May twilight, she poured it at the root of the white jasmine. As it soaked into the earth she fancied for the moment that it looked as if she had shed her heart's blood on the terrace, where she and Percival had so often walked together. Coming back to the table, she set the glass down, looked round, and saw an open book. Instantly she recalled Percival's attitude, how he leant on his elbow and read, and lifted himself to greet her as she came in, and she caught up the volume. There was a step outside, and she fled with her treasure to her own room, There she hung over it, as Isabella over her K 2"], [148, "'FOR PERCIVAL.\" 132 sweet Basil on that very leaf. She put no mark to keep the place, but if anyone studies Keats from that copy, he will find that the book falls open there, and that the creamy smoothness of the page is dimmed in many places. And Percival was being whirled through the cool dusk, further and further away. ' I will see that all is made right \u2014 to-morrow,' the Squire had said in his innocence, and the young man's lips wore a bitter little smile. What could to-morrow do for him ? There are some to-days which to-morrow cannot heal, unless perhaps it is a To-morrow which is very far away. ' We shall do it, sir,' said the driver, and his an.xious face relaxed into an easier expression. ' Yes, we shall do it now, for certain.

His thoughts were of Sissy, and they were disjointed, contra dictory, and powerless. How could he tell what to think ? It seemed to him that he had never known her till that day. At one moment he would say to himself that he had taken her at her word too hastily. And indeed, what she had said did not amount to much, but for one thing. She had implied that she was frightened at the idea of becoming his wife, and her eyes had told her fear even more plainly than her words. Afraid \u2014 but of what ?

And he had fancied that he could shelter and guard her ! He was cut to the heart to think that Sissy should be afraid of him. If she had defended herself, if she had reproached him, and been angry when he had blamed her, it would not have pained him, as did her terrified entreaties to be set free from his love.

Percival threw himself back and folded his arms. ' What's the use of thinking ? I must just drift as usual.' But he could not help thinking. When he reached his rooms again he found a parcel of books and maps which he had ordered, that he might plan his wedding tour, so that no fancy of Sissy's should be unfulfilled. Near it lay another parcel from his tailor, and a letter from a sailor friend, who had just heard of the approaching marriage and wrote to congratulate him. Percival thrust everything aside, and sat musing in his arm chair, till utter weariness drove him to bed. Just at the same time Aunt Harriet was trying to get a little rest. But she was"], [151, "BROKEN OFF. 135 burdened with the weight of Sissy's tidings that it was all over, that her engagement was broken off, and that it was all her own fault, not Percival's. She would not say what was wrong, she was so tired she could not be scolded then. Only it wasn't Percival. He was good. But it could never, never be ; she could not bear it ; it would break her heart. ' Thank goodness,' thought Aunt Harriet, ' the poor child has sobbed herself to sleep, and to-morrow may bring counsel. I can't think what can be amiss. I'll not say anything to Godfrey yet. Broken off \u2014 why it's im possible ! The people are asked to the breakfast, and the presents, too \u2014 there must be some horrible mistake ! I'll find out to morrow ; but, oh dear, oh dear, just when I was so worried with the dressmaker and all. And I'm too old to set lovers' quarrels right \u2014 they are a generation too far away from me. I know it is Percival's doing somehow ; I never could feel as if I quite understood him. Oh, if it could but have been Horace, my own dear boy ! If he had come home strong and well, and they had liked each other, I should have had nothing left to wish for. Oh Horace! Horace ! ' and the old lady floated to a melan choly dreamland, very much as Sissy had done, only that her tears flowed in a tired acquiescence, instead of in a passion of despair."], [152, "136 ' FOR TERCIVAL. CHAPTER X. A REVERIE IN ROOKLEIGH CHURCH. Percival awoke the next morning, gazed at the window, and perceived that a bee was trying to find a hole in the invisible wall which parted it from the blue vault and liberty. He smiled as he watched it. ' Poor thing, did it expect to find any flowers here ? I suppose it wants to be free ; but, if it did get out, the blue itself would be its prison, only so big it wouldn't know it. Are we ever free, I wonder ; or does liberty only mean that we have not yet run our heads against our prison walls ? Poor wretch, how it frets ! I must turn it out directly.' (' Directly,' that is ' immediately.' Why does this word at the end of a sentence always suggest a slight delay ? ' Directly ' in this case meant that Percival would stretch himself lazily, and meditate a few moments longer.) I fancy Queen Sleep has a multitude of"], [153, "A REVERIE IN R00KLEIGH CHURCH. 137 attendant sprites, who wait upon us during the night. She bids them take our burdens of weariness and trouble, and let us have some rest. We load them very heavily, poor little things \u2014 so heavily sometimes that they cannot support the back-breaking weight, and fragments of our everyday anxieties slip down and mingle in our dreams. But the elves do their best, only now and then they are mischievous, and say they will at any rate have an epxchange of burdens, so they toss their queer little perplexities to us to hold, and we have very fantastic visions indeed. It may be that they get so dull towards morning with the burden of our dulness, that they do not notice when we open our eyes, and thus we gain a moment's respite. It happened so that morning, till a little elf, who had been released by an earlier riser, suddenly burst out laughing, hands on hips, gauze wings quivering, and droll head on one side. ' What are you standing there for ? Why that fellow is wide awake, and talking about bees and liberty these five minutes ! ' 'So he is!' said the drowsy sprite; and flinging his load to Percival again, he darted off. The young man sat up with a suddenly troubled face, forgot the bee, and remembered everything else."], [154, "138 ' FOR PERCIVAL.' ' It isn't possible ! ' he said. Something of Aunt Harriet's feeling awoke within him, when he considered the matter by the light of day. I do not know that he thought of the presents exactly, but it did seem to him that he and Sissy had gone too far to draw back. What would everybody say ? Percival hated the thought of the gossip with which Fordborough would be flooded. And what would his grandfather say ? With whom would he be angry ? For angry he would undoubtedly be. Percival could take no comfort from the thought that he would probably escape the old man's wrath, for he felt that Sissy must be sheltered at any cost. He could not walk off in easy impunity, and leave her to bear the blame, yet Sissy was not dependent on his grand father, and he was ; there was the sting ! His heart was aching too. Even if he had Prior's Hurst, what would it be to him without Sissy ? There was a doubt, far down in his soul, whether she had not touched the truth when she said they were not fit for each other, and should not be happy. Unhappi ness was possible there, but he was ready to run the risk. For was happiness possible elsewhere ? It did not seem so to Percival. He had set his heart on Sissy ; she had given"], [155, "A REVERIE IN ROOKLEIGH CHURCH. 139 herself to him ; and it was only three weeks to their wedding day. It was true that he had told her she was free ; but, if she accepted the freedom thus granted, she was forsworn. How many times had she told him that she was his for ever ! What should he do ? He pondered many lines of conduct, and at last came to the somewhat feeble conclusion that if the next morning brought him no news from Brackenhill, he would write to, or perhaps see, Aunt Harriet, but that for that one day he would drift. Percival had an uneasy, half satirical, consciousness that his grave medi tations generally ended in a determination to drift, a result which might have been attained without any meditation at all. He break fasted, fighting all the time against impor tunate thoughts not to be easily banished. He stood by the window, beating an im patient tune upon the panes. ' By Jove, I can't stand it, and I won't,' said Percival. ' I'll go somewhere for the day.' He walked to the nearest station, and happened to stand by a respectable dressed artisan, who was taking his ticket. ' Third \u2014 Rookleigh,' said the man. ' Where on earth is that ? ' said Percival to himself. ' I'll go and see.' He varied the"], [156, "' FOR PERCIVAL. 140 class, ' One first \u2014 Rookleigh,' he said, and followed the workman to the Rookleigh train. It was interesting \u2014 at least with an effort he could fancy it was interesting \u2014 to speculate what kind of place his destination might be. ' Sounds rural,' he reflected. ' Onght to be plenty of trees, and rooks in them. Market ? Perhaps. Inhabitants \u2014 say about eight hundred and fifty-three \u2014 the three has a business-like sound about it. Occupation ? Agriculture and straw-plaiting. Church newly restored, no doubt, and the de luded parishioners think that is a reason for going to look at it.' Rookleigh, when he reached it, proved to be a good-sized, sleepy, country town, which seemed to have trickled down the side of a gentle hill, and crystallised on its way. At the bottom of the slope loitered the most placid of streams, with gardens and orchards on both sides. Most of the riverside houses were red, solid, and respectable. Percival soon decided that the place was inappropri ately named, as there was not a rook to be seen or heard. Its principal productions appeared to be poplars and pigeons. The result of his observations was that two householders out of three grew poplars, and"], [157, "A REVERIE IN ROOKLEIGH CHURCH. 141 three out of four kept pigeons. The tall trees quivering, and the white birds flying, against a background of unclouded blue, had a quaint, peaceful effect. There was much houseleek growing on the steep red roofs, and a decrepit black dog lay dozing in the middle of the principal street. Percival strolled about the town, and looked at shop windows, till the time came when he could go to the Red Lion for some luncheon. They gave him pigeon pie, at which he was not surprised ; in fact, he did not see how they could give him anything else, poplars being uneatable. He made his meal last as long as he could, and then studied the portraits of two or three country squires on their favourite hunters, for he had discovered that Rookleigh was a place from which it was not easy to escape. Failing a train at 1.5, which would have interfered with the pigeon pie, and left him with the afternoon on his hands, he could not get away till 6.45. ' A very good time too,' he said philo sophically. ' I shall get back to dinner with an appetite.' The resources of Rookleigh could not be exhausted, while the Church, which was a little higher up the hill, remained unvisited. A small boy undertook to fetch the clerk,"], [158, "' FOR PERCIVAL/ 142 who kept the key ; and while he was gone Percival sat on a large square tomb, and wondered why its occupant, or occupant's friends, had chosen such a memorial. ' There seems to be a wish that each person's death should cause a sort of little wart on the earth's surface,' he reflected. ' From the Pyramids to those low green hillocks, I suppose it is all the same thing. Luckily, we can't all have what we want, and Time interferes with the plans of those who do, or the face of creation would be speckled with our miserable little gravestones. I'd rather be put away altogether when my time comes, and have the ground smooth over me ; or, if my name must be recorded somewhere, it might be on a bit of pavement.' \u2014 The clerk appeared, more out of breath than seemed proper in such a quiet place as Rookleigh. Percival followed him into the Church, which was spacious and dim, and had some thing of faded worm-eaten stateliness about if. The old man made a few remarks, but had not the unpleasant fluency of vergers in much frequented places. The boy who had been Percival's messenger amused himself with a little stone-throwing in the church yard, and the clerk, after a few glances over"], [159, "A REVERIE IN ROOKLEIGH CHURCH. 143 his shoulder, stole softly through the open door to pounce upon the guilty child. ' Percival smiled and went up to the chancel. It was wide, and not encumbered with pews, and he paused in the open space, noticing the effect of a slanting ray of light. All at once he said to himself, ' This is just where I should stand if I were going to be married.' 'And in fancy he tried to people the empty chancel with the guests who should have gathered for his wedding in three weeks' time. It was a dreary pastime in a dreary place. And when he would have pictured Sissy standing by his side, to be bound to him for ever, he could not recall her face and form, with anything like their wonted clearness. No effort would avail. Indeed, after a prolonged endeavour, it almost seemed as if he could call up nothing but two frightened eyes, which gazed at him out of the still atmosphere of Rookleigh Church. He shivered, and, hearing the old man's step behind him, broke the silence with the first question which came to his lips. ' Do you have many weddings here ? ' ' Not many. Not but what it's a fine Church for 'em. Plenty of room you see, sir.'"], [160, "' FOR PERCIVAL. 144 Thorne nodded. ' What makes your pavement so uneven ? ' he asked. The other looked down. ' Why, it's old Mr. Shadwell ; he's just under you, sir. It's his vault. He was rector here, five-and-fifty years ago. He was a great scholar, they say, and had five sons, all parsons like him self ' All scholars too ?. And all buried here? You must mind what you are about, or the ghosts of the reverend family will be astonished some day, by a wedding party suddenly descending among them,' said Percival as he turned away. The old man pocketed his fee. ' We'll be sure and have it mended before you come to be married here,' he called after his visitor, who passed out into the sunny glare. Where next ? A boat on that languid stream ? Unhappily people did not row on Rookleigh river, or would not let their boats, if they did. Percival had to content himself with a walk along the bank. Coming back he halted, struck with a house on the opposite shore. It was a large, rather handsome red house, old, yet the perfection of neatness and repair \u2014 perhaps even a little too neat, like a fashionable middle-aged woman who is never careless. Its garden"], [161, "A REVERIE IN ROOKLEIGH CHURCH. 145 lay spread, one uniform sunny slope, to the river's edge, and ended, not in possible in equalities of bank, but in a neat low wall. Even now, when June would soon dawn in its glory on the happy world, the house and garden suggested autumn to Percival, and he stopped to wonder why. He thought it might be partly the long straight path which ran down the centre of the slope, and which was of old gravel, subdued in tint, and with a row of espalier apple-trees on either side. Perhaps too many apple-trees in a garden do suggest autumn, as soon as their blossom is fallen. There is an idea of laying fruit away, of garnering a serviceable harvest. Espaliers, too, are not so much trees, as just that amount of tree which will give the necessary apples for pies and puddings, as if one should say to Nature, ' We do not like your heed less, unrestrained ways, and will see no more of them than we can help.' On one side of the house was trained a tree, but not for any ripe delight of August peaches, though it took the sunniest wall. A pear- \u2014 -Percival had an unreasoning conviction that the pears would be hard \u2014 probably requiring to be baked or stewed. Nor was there any wealth of climbing roses in the garden, but he could see chrysanthemums dotted at intervals VOL. II. L"], [162, "146 'for percival. down the long walk, with neat precision, and he was sure that before they blossomed, the place would glow with the earlier splendour of dahlias. Also, there were too many ever greens. Down the central path came an old lady, in slate-coloured silk, carefully looking to right and left, and apparently removing an occasional snail, or dead twig, or injured leaf. Her dress glistened in the sunlight, and Percival watched her awhile from between the hazel boughs, before he became aware that there was some one else in the garden. A cross path had its occupant, who came and went behind the laurels and aucubas, with the unfailing regularity of a pendulum. The leafy screen was too thick for Percival to do more than see that some one passed on the other side, but each time, as she turned at the end to resume her walk, there was a glimpse of a soft grey gown, and once \u2014 surely once, for a moment \u2014 of a grey hat, and golden hair. Again and again, and again, he caught the vanishing fold of her dress, but never again that momentary vision. Certainly there were too many evergreens ! Why did she walk there ? Swift though it was, the dreary regularity of pace told not of inclination, but of duty. Percival watched"], [163, "A REVERIE IN ROOKLEIGH CHURCH. 147 and grew impatient 'Why doesn't she come into the middle walk, and help to pick up snails ? ' he said to himself. ' Anyone would, who saw the poor old lady hunting about.' The latter, who was vigorous and alert, and not so very old either, would not have been best pleased could she have heard his pity, and what was worse, the wearer of the grey gown did not share it, for she left the old lady to deal with the snails single handed. Presently some people came along the footpath, and Percival, who did not choose to be caught watching, sauntered a little way to avoid them, laughing at himself for his interest in the mysterious lady, as he went. ' If I could have seen her, I should not have given her a second thought,' he said. He looked at his watch, and was surprised to find that it was past six. He turned and retraced his* steps, for he was walking away from Rookleigh, and, as he went by the old red house, he looked once more at the garden. Both the ladies had disappeared during his absence. ' Stupid ! ' said Percival. ' If those people hadn't driven me away, I should have seen her go. Now she will remain a mystery for ever.' L 2"], [164, "148 ' FOR PERCIVAL. The mystery did not long retain posses sion of his thoughts. As he journeyed homeward, he recollected that at that hour the evening before he had parted from Sissy. There came a faint glow to his olive cheek as he remembered how she sprang to him, and clung with her arms about his neck, and how he felt her tears and kisses on his face. His heart kindled at the memory, and then grew dull. ' She was very sure of herself, or she had not dared,' he thought. It was past nine when he stood at his own door, having stopped to get some dinner on his way. He could eat, in spite of all his perplexities. He was met by the announce ment, ' Two telegrams come for you, sir.' A telegram is not the alarming fact it used to be, but to be told of two awaiting him quickens the pulses of a man who seldom receives one. Thorne felt that something urgent had occurred. He walked quietly into his room, turned up the gas, saw the envelopes on the table, stretched out his hand to the nearer of the two, hesitated, took up the other and tore it open. Godfrey Hammond, Brackenhill, Ford borough, to Percival Thome, Esq. \u2014 All is over. You could not have been in time. Will meet first train at Fordborough to-morrow."], [165, "A REVERIE IN ROOKLEIGH CHURCH. 149 He stood like a statue, but his brain reeled. ' My God ! She is dead ! ' he said at last. ' I have killed her. And she wanted me, and I was not there.' If suffering could expiate sin, that moment's agony should have cleansed his whole life. He did not think, he did not attempt to think, what had happened at Brackenhill. Sissy was, in his eyes, as delicate as a butterfly or a flower. A breath might kill her, and this telegram, with its ' All is over,' hardly seemed an un natural ending to the passion, and terror, and hopeless renunciation of the night before. 'All is over,' she had said, and had torn herself from his arms. And what her sweet lips had uttered, the hateful paper echoed \u2014 ' All is over ' \u2014 and lay there like incarnate fate. Percival lacked strength to open the other message. What could it tell him that he did not know ? He felt as if the un availing summons, which was imprisoned there, would stab him to the heart. Out of that envelope would rush Sissy's appeal to him, her last cry out of the black night of death, and no answer would be possible. He walked to and fro, casting troubled glances at it. His pleasant familiar room suddenly became a hideous torture-chamber, and a black pall had fallen over his life."], [166, "'FOR PERCIVAL.' 150 At last he opened the second message with fingers that quivered like aspen-leaves. The paper rustled in his hands, as he un folded it, and read : \u2014 Mrs. Middleton, Bracketihill, to Percival Thorne, Esq. \u2014 Your grandfather is danger ously ill. Come at once. Do not lose a moment. He flung it down, and faced the world, a man once more. It was not that he was heartless \u2014 that he did not care for the old Squire who was gone. He felt the blow, but this was a grief which came out of the shadows into the light of common day. It was like waking from a deathlike swoon to the anguish of a wound. A nightmare was transformed into a sorrow."], [167, "151 CHAPTER XI. OF A GOLDEN WEDDING. As the 9.15 train slackened speed at Ford borough Station, Percival looked out, and saw Godfrey Hammond standing on the platform. It was exactly what he had anti cipated, and yet it gave him a little shock of surprise to see Godfrey just as usual, in a light grey suit such as he often wore at Brackenhill, trim, neat, alert, looking as if he had slept well, and breakfasted well, and watching the train with his glass stuck in his eye. Percival did not really expect to see any outward signs of grief. It was hardly probable that Hammond would appear with his clothes rent, lamenting aloud, and casting dust upon his head, yet his unchanged aspect startled the young man. Have we not all been startled in the same way by the want of sympathy between outward things and our inward joys and sorrows ? If our feelings"], [168, "152 ' FOR PERCIVAL. change, do we not straightway want the universe made anew to our pattern ? Percival sprang out and suddenly came within the range of Hammond's eyeglass. A smile of recognition dawned on the other's face. ' Ah here you are ! ' he said. Perhaps there was a little more firmness in his clasp, as he shook hands with the young man. ' That's well. I was considering what I should do if you didn't come. Only that bag ? The carriage is waiting.' The station-master came up, touched his hat, and made a remark. ' Thank you,' said Hammond. ' As well as can be expected. Very sudden \u2014 yes \u2014 and very terrible. Are you ready, Percival ? ' The brougham was outside. ' We shall be by ourselves,' said Godfrey, who generally preferred the dog-cart. A minute later they were rolling smoothly along the road, which Percival had traversed in such haste so short a time before. ' I was out,' said young Thorne abruptly. ' I didn't get your messages till between nine and ten last night' ' I said you were out,' Hammond replied. ' It was quite as well. You could not possibly have been in time, and could not have done any good.'"], [169, "OF A GOLDEN WEDDING. 153 ' How \u2014 when did it happen ? ' ' Yesterday morning, quite early. In fact, it was all over before the first telegram was sent. But when they awoke Mrs. Middleton with the news \u2014 in a very foolish and in considerate manner, I fear \u2014 she absolutely refused to believe it, and they tell me her first cry was \" Send for Percival \u2014 Godfrey will want Percival ! \" She wrote the message to you herself; but, long before the man could have reached Fordborough with it, she must have known it was utterly useless. In fact, after the first shock she rallied, and regained her calmness and good sense in a most surprising way. She feels it terribly, but when I got there she was quite herself ' But how was it ? ' said Percival. ' When I left my grandfather on Wednesday night he seemed quite well.' ' Ah that's the sad part of it. It was an accident' ' An accident ! ' ' Poison,' said Hammond. ' An over dose of some opiate or other. No \u2014 don't look so scared. There was no possibility of foul play. It is as clear as daylight.' (What Godfrey Hammond said was per fectly true. There was no foul play, and the"], [170, "154 ' FOR PERCIVAL.1 death was as mere an accident as if Mr. Thorne had killed himself by falling downstairs. It was not really more terrible that his hand should falter than that his foot should slip. But there is always something ghastly in the idea of poison, and Percival's heart seemed to stand still for a moment.) ' He was late on Wednesday night,' said Hammond. ' He wrote a letter to Hardwicke, and sent it to the post. After that he sat for a considerable time alone in the drawing-room, for Sissy was not well, and Mrs. Middleton was with her. When he went upstairs Turner noticed that he was more inclined to talk than usual. He said more than once that he had had a good deal of anxiety and trouble of late, but that now he hoped all would be right Just as he was lying clown, he remarked that he had written to Mr. Hardwicke, and should drive to Ford borough the next day to see him. Turner says that his answer was, \" Oh, indeed, sir, then I suppose Mr. Hardwicke is home again ? \" and that Mr. Thorne sat up with a startled look on his face, and said, \" Good God! is Hardwicke out?\" The man was surprised, and told him that he had heard that Mr. Hardwicke had gone abroad some where, but he did not know for certain.

He could hear him tossing un- easily in his bed, till being tired he dropped off to sleep himself. He was awakened after a time by Mr. Thorne calling him. \" I can't sleep,\" he said, \" and I can't afford to lose my night's rest, for I have something I must do to-morrow.\" He told Turner to bring his little medicine-chest, and unlocked it with the key which hung with two or three others on his watch-chain. Turner was not sur- prised, as he occasionally took something of the kind, though not very often. He waited to carry it away again, but Mr. Thorne looked up, with the bottle in his hand, and said the candle was too bright, and hurt his eyes, and that he could see better with only the lamp which burnt by his bedside. Turner was going to put it out, when your grandfather added, \" And that dressing-room window rattles again \u2014 go and see if you can stop it.\" He thinks he might have been five minutes at the window.

When he went in at about eight the next morning, Mr. Thorne lay in precisely the same attitude \u2014 dead.' ' How do they know it was ' Percival began. ' Turner saw how much there was in the bottle, and drew his own conclusions. The idiot needn't have rushed to announce them to Mrs. Middleton, though. Your grand father had lately been taking something for those headaches of his, and the man's theory is that in a fit of absence he poured out the same quantity of this. I don't know, I'm sure, I'm not in the habit of taking poisons myself, and don't understand anything about them. I locked everything up, or the whole household would have had their fingers in the bottle.' ' There will be an inquest ? ' ' To-morrow. But there is no possible doubt as to the result.' Godfrey took his chin between his fingers and stroked it medi tatively as he spoke. ' I shall miss the old Squire,' he said after a pause, with a weight of meaning in the simple words. ' But, thank God, it must have been a painless death.'"], [173, "OF A GOLDEN WEDDING. 157 ' I suppose so,' was Percival's reply. He was wondering, even while he acquiesced, whether there had been a moment, the merest lightning flash of time, during which the old man had been conscious of his blunder. If so, there had been a moment of suffering keener than death itself. And even if not \u2014 where was he now ? Did he know that his delay had ruined his favourite ? Did he, even in a new life, feel a pang of impotent anguish at the thought of what might have been ? ' For he cares still,' said Percival to himself. And his heart went forth in deep tenderness towards the old man. ' If you could only know,' he thought. ' Duncan telegraphed to me on his own account,' Hammond went on, ' and sent the message at the same time as the one to you, only his was more accurate. I got it about an hour before the train left. I always told \u2014 I always said that old butler was no fool \u2014 except about wine.' ' Sissy ? ' said Percival. The other looked grave. ' Sissy is not at Brackenhill. She was far from well, and we feared it would be too much for her \u2014 the inquest, the funeral, and all. Laura Falconer came over yesterday afternoon, and insisted on taking the poor child away.

Percival knew, by his sense of relief, that he had dreaded a meeting with Sissy in that horrible house of death. ' Horace \u2014 is he back again ? ' ' Yes, and Mrs. James too. If there were any conceivable piece of mischief that she could have on hand, I should say she was plotting something. They have sent off telegrams with mysterious secrecy, and they hold solemn councils in every corner. But as I can't see what they can be after, I sup pose it is only Mrs. James Thome's agree able manner.' ' Most likely,' said Percival. ' Young Henry Hardwicke came over yesterday with the letter. His father had gone to see about some French property, which a client of his wants to sell. He was not certain about the distance to the place, nor how long he would be there, so he only gave Henry his address at a Parisian hotel. We have written and telegraphed there, and have despatched a message to him at his final destination as well as the young fellow and I could make it out, but I am not at all sure of it.'"], [175, "OF A GOLDEN WEDDING. 159 ' He has not answered then ? An awk ward time for him to be away.' ' Yes, but he had an appointment with the Squire for ne.xt week \u2014 I suppose to settle things for you and Sissy. Your grand father says nothing in the note, except that he is coming over, and particularly wants to see Hardwicke that day, and to look at his will.' Percival sat for a moment in silent thought. This was the will which had been made before he ever saw his grandfather, and which the old man had been so anxious to alter. What was in it ? It would not leave him Brackenhill, nor Prior's Hurst, not so much as an inch of land. But was it possible that there would be nothing what ever for him ? The Squire had not said that, and it did not seem probable that he would have altogether passed over one who had done nothing to offend him, when he thought so much of his family, and the Thornes were so few. But Percival was constrained to own that it was possible. A couple of days earlier he had feared depen dence \u2014 now he feared beggary. ' This will put off your marriage,' said Hammond, suddenly. ' Yes,' said Percival, still absorbed in"], [176, "160 ' FOR PERCIVAL. thought But a moment later he turned, and looked at Godfrey. ' No, it won't,' he said. ' There is no marriage to be put off. Look here, Godfrey, the day may come that I shall ask you to remember when it was I told you this. Sissy and I parted for ever before my grand- father's death \u2014 do you understand ? Aunt Harriet can bear witness to that It was on Wednesday night. We thought it was best. If anyone was to blame, it was I. It is all over, really and finally. At this present moment Sissy no doubt believes that I am the master of Brackenhill. Knowino* what she knew, and being well aware that my grandfather had no time to change anything after his talk with me, she can hardly think otherwise. But the Ford borough gossips will say she threw me over because I was poor. You must contradict that ' Hammond looked fixedly at him. ' Ah ! ' he said. ' But will you be poor ? ' ' Horace will have Brackenhill.' ' Horace hardly thinks so.' ' He will. At least,. unless there is some flaw in the will, which is not likely, as Hard wicke made it. Even then I should not dispute his claim. You had better not say"], [177, "161 OF A GOLDEN WEDDING. anything to him, perhaps, till the will is read ; but I know how it must be.' 'Well,' said Hammond, 'suppose Horace does have Brackenhill ; and perhaps he has the best right \u2014 may I say so ? ' ' / say so.' ' Your grandfather could still provide for you, so that you would not be poor in any terrible sense of the word. Perhaps you may even be in easier circumstances than Horace, who will have that great house to keep up.' ' Had my grandfather lived another day, he would have provided for me,' Percival replied. ' As it is, the will that Hardwicke will produce is an old one, made five or six years since, before I ever set foot in Brackenhill.' Hammond was startled. ' You don't mean it ! You'll come badly off in that, my poor fellow,' he said. ' What, had he never altered his will ? It is incredible \u2014 at his age ! What folly, or ' 'No,' Percival interrupted. ' Don't say a word against him. Suppose he should be able to hear us ! ' he said, with a half smile at the fancy \u2014 a smile which ended in a sigh. ' I wish he could ; I should like to tell him something ' VOL. II. M"], [178, "162 ' FOR PERCIVAL. They were turning in at the gate. The old woman who opened it caught sight of Percival, and curtsied reverentially, mistaking a meteor for the rising sun. The young man answered with an absent nod. ' I only tell you this, that you may stand up for Sissy,' he said, as they went up the drive. ' That I will, if needful,' his companion replied. ' But I'm sorry to hear this. Per haps, after all, there may be no opportunity for any gossip. Are you quite sure ' ' That it is all over ? Yes,' said Percival. Aunt Harriet met him, with a face which was pathetic by reason of its very calmness. Her eyes were swollen and tired, and the pretty pink colour in her cheeks had all retreated into the little veins. Her lips quivered suddenly now and then, as if a barbed arrow-head had been left in her wound. She looked doubtfully at Percival for a moment, but there was no mistaking the sadness and sympathy in his eyes ; and, as if drawn by an invincible impulse, she put up her face, that he might stoop and kiss her. ' God help you, Aunt Harriet ! ' he said. But even as he spoke, she drew her hands away, and turned aside. ' Don't talk to me just yet, Percival.' Her heart was torn with conflicting"], [179, "OF A GOLDEN WEDDING. 163 feelings. The young man who stood before her \u2014 his dark eyes eloquent with his desire to comfort her in her sorrow, was Godfrey's Percival, his favourite \u2014 was dearer to God frey than all the world beside. She had felt as if her heart were breaking as she drew her hands out of his soft, lingering clasp, and yet as if it were treachery to leave them there. For what had he done with his smooth words, but make his way into her brother's heart, and rob Horace of his inheritance ? And what had he done with his eloquent eyes, and clasping hands, but win Sissy Langton, and break her heart ? Sissy had said that it was not his fault \u2014 that he was good ; but how could Mrs. Middleton believe him guiltless, when she knew how the poor child had loved him ? Sissy would never have been false to him \u2014 it was not possible. And yet, after all, he was Godfrey's boy ; and there was nothing now that she could do for Godfrey, except what she did for Percival. She dropped into her arm-chair again, and hid her face in her hands. When she looked up, he was still standing there, silenced, yet pleading. Presently he knelt on one knee before her. ' Aunt Harriet,' he said. ' He was very good to me. I wi.sh I could tell him so, but M 2"], [180, "164 'FOR PERCIVAL.' I can't, so I must tell you. I've no one now you see.' She laid her trembling hand upon his head. He had no one now. That was true, but he would have Brackenhill, and friends would come in crowds. He had health and wealth, and all his life before him ; and he would prosper and be popular, and go on his triumphant way, and find a new love, and marry her ; while her poor dying Horace and her broken-hearted darling passed away like shadows from his path. That was the future as she saw it in her grief, though it turned another face to Percival. ' Don't think me unkind,' she said to Godfrey's boy, ' but you must go away for a little while. I can't bear it yet ; I'm not very strong.' Going out, he encountered Horace in the passage, looking terribly ill and worn \u2014 a shadow, with feverishly brilliant eyes. Per cival held out his hand. The other just touched it with his fingers ; but he did even that under protest, as it were, and because Godfrey Hammond was standing by, and an open quarrel would be unbecoming in that house of death. ' This is very terrible,' said Percival. Horace uttered a murmur of assent, and escaped."], [181, "OF A GOLDEN WEDDING. 165 His cousin looked after him with pained eyes. Then he turned to Godfrey Ham mond. ' I shan't be long at Brackenhill when its master is known, shall I ? ' said he. ' Who knows ? ' was the reply. 'If it be as you say, he will have no cause for ill-will.' ' He'll only think I tried to supplant him, and failed. A year ago we were friends, but that can never be again. At times I almost fancy someone must have poisoned his mind against me.' ' Mrs. James, perhaps,' said Hammond. He would have attributed anything to Mrs. James. They went out on the terrace. Percival sat on the stone balustrade, folded his arms, and surveyed Brackenhill from end to end, as he had surveyed it the evening he saw it first. Then his grandfather had reproached him for his indifferent declaration that he liked old houses, as if this were no more to him than any other. Now his heart was heavy within him because it was so much more, and he was so soon to be banished from it. ' When is the funeral to be ? ' he asked. ' Monday.' ' Monday ! Isn't that very soon ? Why, it \u2014 it was only on Thursday morning ' ' It is unusually early,' said Hammond. ' But Mrs. Middleton especially wishes it to"], [182, "166 ' FOR PERCIVAL. be on Monday.' He touched a spot of lichen on the stone with his slim forefinger, and eyed it thoughtfully. ' Did you ever notice, Thorne, how great women are on domestic dates ? They always know your birthday, and when you had the measles, or the precise day on which you made some one an offer, or fell downstairs, or were confirmed, or vaccinated, or came of age. Haven't you noticed ? ' ' Well ? ' said Percival. ' Well,' said Hammond \u2014 trying hard to speak as if he scoffed at the little sentiment, and doing it in the tenderest voice, and with his head turned away, because, though he cared for few people, he cared much for the Squire and Aunt Harriet \u2014 ' well, it seems that next Monday will be the anniversary of Mr. Thome's wedding-day, fifty years ago. So Mrs. Middleton has the fancy that it shall be the day of his funeral \u2014 a sort of golden wedding, eh ? \u2014 when those two shall be side by side once more. Very absurd, you know \u2014 what difference can it make ? Of course the whole thing must seem doubly ridiculous to you ; you can't get up any sentiment about your grandmother, can you, Thorne ? Why, if she stepped out of a romance, she is your grandmother, and"], [183, "167 OF A GOLDEN WEDDING. there's an end of it. I remember Mrs. Thorne very well. She used to go about the house wrapped up in a drab shawl, and she read prayers to the poor Squire and the servants, and had the toothache a good deal. When I came over from school one day, and he tipped me a sovereign, she saw it, and said, \" Haifa crown would have been ample, Godfrey.\" I buttoned my jacket over it, and ran away as hard as I could go, but I can hear her very tone at this moment' ' Perhaps,' said Percival, ' she wasn't quite the same fifty years ago. Perhaps she isn't quite the same now.' ' Perhaps not. And, at any rate, Mrs. Middleton doesn't see any absurdity in it. She was Miss Harvey's bridesmaid. Half a century ago, to the very day, the bells were ringing over there, and the children throwing flowers down on the path, and people making speeches and fools of themselves ; and Mrs. Middleton was a pretty girl, as merry as any of them. And now it's horrible. He's to go back there to be buried, and she By Jove, he's the lucky one now !' ' But he wasn't married at Brackenhill ? ' said Percival. ' He was, though. General Harvey lived in the old red house near the rectory. You"], [184, "168 ' FOR PERCIV.AL.' can't remember it ; it was pulled down twelve or fifteen years ago. I wonder if there are any others alive who were at that wedding. What a ghastly meeting it would be if they could come together, eh ? I wonder why she couldn't let it rest, instead of forcing one to think of all this nonsense. But, being a woman, of course she couldn't. So Monday it is to be, and Monday it shall be, if the undertaker and all the milliners die of over work, and even if Mrs. James doesn't get her crape and bugles in time ! ' So saying, Godfrey Hammond moved off; but Percival lingered on the terrace, thinking of that Golden Wedding. Willie Falconer rode over in the after noon to inquire how they all were, and to bring a note from Laura. Sissy was not e-xcited or hysterical, but gentle, silent, and depressed. ' She took no notice when I spoke of sending over to Brackenhill,' Laura wrote. ' I said, \" I suppose Mr. Percival Thorne must have arrived by this time,\" and then she answered, \" Yes, most likely.\" \" Have you any message ?.\" I asked. She only shook her head, and laid her cheek on my hand. But just now she has looked up and said, \" My love to Aunt Harriet.\" I"], [185, "169 OF A GOLDEN WEDDING. will write again to-morrow, and hope she may be more like herself. I am thankful to say she slept well last night.' Percival, who had begged the note from Mrs. Middleton, studied it as if he would compel it to yield every atom of its meaning. ' She slept well.' Poor Sissy ! That Wed nesday evening she had said, ' I wonder if I shall sleep now?' He thanked God that that poor little boon was not denied her. Young Falconer went off with a letter from Aunt Harriet. The poor old lady, after writing it, made up her mind to a painful effort, and came downstairs. I think she feared some outbreak on Horace's part, and felt that her presence might control her favourite. She took her usual place when dinner-time came. There was a little diffi culty among the rest of the party, and the two young men exchanged doubtful glances. Percival, who had given away Brackenhill, hesitated about resigning his right to his grandfather's chair. Neither so much wished to take the vacant place as was un willing to seem as if he thought his rival had the better claim. ' Godfrey Hammond, will you sit at the bottom of the table ?' said Aunt Harriet, in her gentle voice. ' It will not seem so \u2014 so"], [186, "170 ' FOR PERCIVAL. strange. You used to sit there sometimes, do you remember ? A long time ago, when he was often out' Percival dropped into a chair with a sigh of relief. He could yield the place, since it was not to Horace. Hammond began to carve in his swift, methodical way. He had Mrs. James Thorne on his right, and Horace sat between his mother and Aunt Harriet. Percival was alone on the opposite side. Mrs. James thought it her duty to be profoundly affected on this occasion. Her long-drawn and resounding sighs were heard from time to time, but she contrived to eat a very substantial dinner in the intervals. Hammond, even while he politely helped her, meditated profoundly on the restraints of habit anc etiquette. They seemed to him extraordinarily powerful. Mrs. James took out a handkerchief with a wide hem, and wiped nothing out of her eyes with the greatest care. Hammond felt that if he had been a shade less civilised, he must have got up and shaken her that moment. Horace played languidly with his knife and fork, but could not eat. He broke the silence once with a question. ' Has any thing been heard of Hardwicke yet ?'"], [187, "171 OF A GOLDEN WEDDING. ' Nothing,' said Hammond. ' But I shall hear as soon as there is any news. Harry Hardwicke has promised to let me know at once.' ' What is to be done if he doesn't come ? ' ' I haven't the least idea. He will come.' Hammond's tone was that of one who checks a discussion, and the heavy silence settled down again. When the litde party broke up, Percival went away on a melancholy errand. As he entered a shadowy room, and closed the door behind him, the outer world of warmth and light grew strangely small and distant. Advancing with noiseless steps, he touched the heavy hangings of the bed. Life seemed nothing but a dream, and this calm, which ended all, the one reality. Standing by the dead man's side, and gazing on his face, he recalled the last words that he had heard that pale mouth utter, ' It shall all be made right \u2014 to-morrow.' And, before the morrow, Death had come, to set all things straight after his own fashion. The young man, with his strongly beating pulses, looked down on the features, which were placid and not unhappy in their fi.xed expression, but drawn, and cold, and like a delicately"], [188, "172 'FOR PERCIVAL. modelled wax mask, rather than a face of flesh. And as he looked he longed to be able to ask, 'Is all made right with you, now To-morrow has come ? ' Yet, even while he longed to ask, he shuddered \u2014 O God ! the horror, if those blue lips should unclose and answer him ! He could not take his eyes from the corpse, and a chill ran slowly through his veins. He felt as if a cold breath were blowing on him from the outer darkness, that girdles the little space of sun, and shade, and cheerful firelight, which we call our life. With a strong effort, he tore himself away, and hurried downstairs. He was ashamed of his unreasoning horror, and felt that he would rather not face the others till he had recovered his calmness, so he turned into the library, and flung himself into an arm-chair. He was sincerely ashamed, and yet he could not help it. That was not how he should have felt \u2014 not how he had expected to feel, while look ing for the last time on the poor old Squire who had been good to him. But as he sat in the gathering twilight, the troubled thoughts and fancies, which had swung beyond his control in that momentary terror, slowly swayed back to rest, and he asked himself why he should have expected his"], [189, "OF A GOLDEN WEDDING. 173 feelings to be after one pattern more than another. Others have no doubt known the same surprise and perplexity. Many writers have described to us the emotions of the soul in supreme moments, and such descriptions are very striking. They are, no doubt, the fruit of undistracted meditation, and are enriched with the abundant adjectives of leisure. But when the crisis comes, in hurry and confusion, we are apt to discover with astonishment, that it has not conferred upon us the power of talking in blank verse. Percival propped his forehead on his hand and pondered drearily. Suddenly into his downward bent eyes there came a flash of recognition and startled remembrance. The household work had been somewhat neglected during the confusion of the last few days, and as no fire had been lighted no one had looked at the grate. In the fender lay a little heap of black ashes. Thorne knew what they were. Overhead lay the man who had so long been master there, dead and impotent, and here lay his will, as powerless as himself. The young man felt that the destruction of that paper had cost him more than he had anticipated. The broken fragments of tinder mocked him with"], [190, "'FOR PERCIVAL. 174 the thought of what might have been. But did he repent ? No, from the bottom of his heart \u2014 No ! It was a deed to be done with out counting the cost. All passed off very smoothly at the inquest, as Hammond had foretold. Turner gave his evidence clearly and well ; there was no need to call Mrs. Middleton, who had literally nothing to tell ; and there was a general feeling of regret, and respectful sympathy. In spite of his pride, and his perverse spirit of contradiction, Godfrey Thorne had gained a certain place in his neighbours' liking. He never achieved popularity, but he had ruled at Brackenhill so long that people took him for granted, and only grumbled at his freaks, as they grumbled at the weather, or anything else that was entirely beyond their control. And everyone liked his sister. She was wonderfully relieved when the dreaded hour was over, and began to move about the house with mournful activity, and to take an interest in the arrangements which had hitherto been left altogether in Hammond's hands. Other cares divided her thoughts with these sombre preparations. On Sunday afternoon she came downstairs with her bonnet on, and looked for Percival."], [191, "OF A GOLDEN WEDDING. 175 He was in the library, reading the Saturday Review. He looked up when the old lady put her hand on his shoulder : ' Will you give me your arm ? ' she said, ' I want to take a turn in the garden.' Pacing to and fro, with little steps, on the sunny side of the clipped yew hedge, Aunt Harriet opened her heart to her companion. ' Percival,' she said, ' I am so sorry about you and Sissy \u2014 so very sorry. I don't know what to say. I'm too old to meddle in your love affairs ' \u2014 the feeling with which she had first greeted the news recurred to her \u2014 'a generation too old at the very least. But ' ' I don't know that,' said Percival. 'When people talk of second childhood they usually mean something unpleasant, but they needn't. We young folks sometimes feel as if the middle-aged people were the furthest away, and such as you were coming gently back to us. They have lost their illusions, you see, and are hard and embittered, while you ' ' Do you think illusions grow again for us ? ' said the old lady, looking up with a smile of tender scorn. ' No \u2014 if they are illusions there can be no resurrection of the dead for them. Only truths live. But there has been time with you for flowers to grow upon their graves.'"], [192, "176 ' FOR PERCIVAL. Percival, burdened with the difficulties of his position, was not sorry thus to divert an embarrassing conversation into idle mean derings round the subject of youth and old age. It is a subject concerning which we almost all have something to say, for we must be young indeed if we have no back ward glances, which love to dwell for a moment on the past. But Aunt Harriet was not to be turned from her purpose. ' I don't know much about any flowers growing now,' she said. ' And it isn't the right time to be thinking of a wedding, with our dead still in the house. But what can I do ? For if you stand apart too long, you will never come together again. And God frey was so pleased that you two should marry. He wished it so \u2014 what can I do ? ' Percival dropped his former manner in a moment, and came abruptly to the point, since what he would have avoided was in evitable. ' What can / do ? ' he said gravely. ' Tell me what is wrong,' Aunt Harriet pleaded. ' May I judge what you can do ? Afterwards, you can decide for yourself what you will do.' ' It is impossible for me to tell you all,' he replied. ' Sissy and I differed about some thing. We didn't quarrel, you understand ;"], [193, "OF A GOLDEN WEDDING. 177 we simply looked on the matter in question in a totally different light. I was grieved, but I did not see why we should not remain as we were, and live down our misunder standing. Sissy, however, asked me to re lease her from her promise. I did so \u2014 God knows with what reluctance. But since then, the more I think of it the more I fear that Sissy was right.' Aunt Harriet took her hand from his arm. ' Ah ! You think this unsatisfactory, and me cold ? ' said Percival. ' You may under stand me better some day. Or you may not' ' I couldn't understand you less.' ' I can't help talking in riddles. Aunt Harriet, when anyone you love is dying, and lingers very long in pain, you would give your life that he should live, and yet, when death comes, it is a relief, and you know that it is best. I can't bear to look forward to my life now. I used to look forward to a happy future with Sissy. Now that future is dead, and has left me very lonely, but it is better that it should be so than that it should die slowly and painfully, as I fear it would have done.' ' But why ? \u2014 why ? For she loved you. And you loved her ? ' VOL II. N"], [194, "178 ' FOR PERCIVAL. Percival bent his head, and the solemn o*esture was more than a thousand words. ' Are you sure she loved me ? ' he said, after a pause. ' I think not She fancied she did \u2014 poor child ! \u2014 but she was afraid of me. I felt as if she stabbed me when she looked up at me with her frightened eyes. I did not mean to be hard on her ; I meant to be very gentle ; but even my gentleness was rough and stern to her, it seems. When she shrank away from me, and begged for her freedom, what could I do but give it back to her ? I would have given her my life, only it wouldn't have been much to the purpose.' ' But are you sure \u2014 ? It was so hasty,' faltered Aunt Harriet. ' Shall I tell you what makes me sure, now that the first shock has passed, and I can understand it better ? ' said Percival gloomily. 'When we were going to part, when I had yielded, and she was free, she put her arms about my neck, and kissed me. She wouldn't have let me hold her and kiss her, unless she were very certain of her freedom, unless she knew that I could never win her back again. And she cried, my poor darling, I felt her tears. She wouldn't have been so grieved for my pain without being quite sure there was no help for it.'"], [195, "OF A GOLDEN WEDDING. 179 Aunt Harriet looked at the little pebbles at her feet. She was silenced, perplexed, distressed. ' Perhaps in a little while you may see that it is best as it is, in other ways,' said Percival. ' At any rate, could anything be so dreadful as that we should marry, and that I should find that I couldn't make her happy, and know that I had had the doubt in my heart, even on our wedding day ? As I should have.' ' I don't know what to think,' said Aunt Harriet. ' Wait,' Percival replied. ' Wait till this sorrowful time has gone by a little. See if Sissy is not brighter and happier for her liberty, if she does not regain her strength and spirits.' ' But Sissy was ill before her engagement to you. That can't be it' ' Wait and see,' he continued. ' If she does, you will know that my fear was the truth ; that she mistook her feelings towards me, and did not love me.' ' If she is happier \u2014 and if not ? ' ' What can I do ? ' he replied. ' I have given her all I could \u2014 and it was very little use, I think. Here is Hammond coming.' Godfrey, with his eyeglass up, came N 2"], [196, "180 'FOR PERCIVAL. peering* round the wall of green. ' Harry Hardwicke is here,' he announced as he ap proached.

She re leased Percival as she spoke, dismissed him with a sad little smile, and followed him with her eyes. ' Godfrey Hammond,' she said, ' I'm troubled about him.' ' About Percival ? Why ?

' It's you who have done everything, and taken all the trouble,' said the old lady, looking up at him. ' What with the letters, and Robinson \u2014 ' (Robinson was the under taker) \u2014 ' and the Times, and the servants' mourning, and that dreadful inquest, I don't know how to thank you.' ' Don't,' said Hammond. ' I didn't do it for the sake of thanks. I did it for the sake of Auld Lang Syne, eh ? for your sake, and his, and because I'm a meddlesome fellow, who thinks he could manage creation better than anybody else. We know each other of old, don't we ? ' Mrs. Middleton wept silently, and held his hand.' ' Better ? ' he said after a minute or two, laying his other hand so lightly on hers that the momentary touch was barely a caress. ' You are so good \u2014 so good,' Aunt Harriet whispered. ' It would have been such a load on my mind \u2014 the mourning and all.' ' Oh, I made Mrs. James help me,' said Hammond. ' Her knowledge went a good way, with a little of my common sense.' They were walking towards the house. 1 Don't be hard on Horace,' said Mrs. Middleton suddenly. ' Oh, don't be hard on"], [198, "182 ' FOR PERCIVAL. my poor boy, for it's very hard on him al ready.' ' I'm not hard on him. But to tell you the truth, Horace rather avoids me, so it isn't very easy to be cordial. I don't know why he should. Still I don't forget that both the boys are in a difficult position.' ' Both ? ' ' Both,' Godfrey repeated firmly. ' I hardly know how one could be just to their respective claims. But you must find out how to hold the balance fairly, for they both love you.' I do not think any of the party slept soundly that Sunday night. Percival did not. He lay, seeking through the shadows for the first faint outline of the window, which would show that the brief summer darkness was drawing to a close. And as he lay there he tried hard to realise what seemed so incredible to him, that less than a week had done it all. Si.x days earlier he had been busy with the preparations for his marriage. It was on the Tuesday that he had called on Godfrey Hammond, and heard of the Lisle failure. Nonsense ! It was absurd. Why, it must be months since Lisle failed ! And yet he knew he heard of it on Tuesday night Then on Wednesday"], [199, "183 OF A GOLDEN WEDDING. he came down to Brackenhill, and Addie Blake was in the train, and made a mystery of something or other \u2014 talked in Gunpowder Plot fashion about some silly secret of hers, which could not matter to any one. And he told his grandfather of his loss, and made up his mind that he was to carry the Old Man of the Sea on his shoulders from that time forward. Percival hated to recall this feeling. He knew that it was not altogether unjust, yet now it seemed a horrible thing to have had such a thought of the poor old Squire, who had loved him, and who was dead. That evening he saw Sissy, and they kissed each other and parted. Good heavens ! was it only four days since he said good-bye to Sissy ! Or was it four years ? Or four centuries ? Thursday he was at Rookleigh. Where was Rookleigh ? In some other planet, surely. The sleepy little town, with its formal trees, its white birds, its cloudless blue sky, came before his mind in wonderful fulness of detail. It was most vivid, yet most unreal, as if a man should have passed just one day amid the familiar scenery of a willow-patterned plate, should have walked over the queer little bridge we know so well, should have rested in the mansion beneath the heavily-fruited tree, and then come"], [200, "' FOR PERCIVAL.' 184 suddenly back to his English life again. So clear, and so incredible, was that day to Per cival. And thinking of it he fell into a light, uneasy sleep, and dreamed that it was his grandfather's wedding day, and that the ceremony was to be performed in Rookleigh Church. But all was anxiety and confusion, for the bride was not ready, and the time was very short. Percival thought that he held Godfrey Hammond by the sleeve in the lych gate, and tried to warn him that the Shad wells' vault was not safe. Godfrey, however, laughed, and said it was all right ; he had put the Squire down there to wait till the bride should arrive, and the best man was standing on the entrance stone, to keep him from coming up till they were ready. Per cival might have been astonished at such a method of disposing of the bridegroom, but at that moment he remembered that it was his wedding day too, and where was Sissy ? And then followed a nightmare hunt for her, high and low. It was only ended by a sudden certainty, how acquired Percival could not tell, that Sissy was with the Squire, in the Shadwells' awful vault. He was not far from waking when he came to this point, and all the hideous horror of the thought flashed upon him. He could not see Sissy, he could"], [201, "185 OF A GOLDEN WEDDING. not get at her, and yet her frightened eyes drove him to despair. He started up in bed to find himself still at Brackenhill, with the cloudless sky glowing through his window, the June sun crowning the tree tops with gold, and the breezes softly whispering among the roses outside. The horrible fancy vanished. But surely it was not all a dream, something was going to happen \u2014 who was to be married that morning ? With a quick grasp at realities, Percival remembered that this was the Squire's Golden Wedding day."], [202, "' FOR PERCIVAL.' 186 CHAPTER XII. WHY NOT LOTTIE ? It was all over. The neighbourhood had paid due honour to Godfrey Thorne. Old Garnett, who was kept at home by his gout, had written a letter of condolence to Mrs. Middleton, and expressed his deep regret at his enforced absence. She was pleased with the letter. She did not care for Dick Gar nett, but he had known her brother all his life. She would not have been so pleased, perhaps, had she seen old Dick grinning, and showing his fierce old teeth, as he wrote it.

Fifty years ago there was Thorne, like a fool, worshipping the very ground Fanny Harvey trod on, and a few years later he wasn't particularly sorry to put her safe underneath it. \"Wonderful coal-scuttle of a bonnet she wore that wedding-day, to be sure. And I was best man ; ' Dick chuckled at the thought. ' I shouldn't look much like best man now. Ah, well, I mayn't be best, but I'm a better man than old Godfrey to-day, anyhow.' (And so no doubt for this world's affairs Richard Garnett was, on the principle that ' a living dog is better than a dead lion.') ' And the candle-maker's daughter begins her reign, for that poor lad will never marry. Upon my word, I believe I'm a better man than Master Horace now. And I'm not likely to play the fool with physic bottles, either; I know a little better than that A No, Aunt Harriet would not have liked Garnett's train of thought, as he folded and addressed the letter which pleased her. And yet the old fellow meant the best he could. And now it was all over, and Brackenhill would know Godfrey Thorne no more. But for that one day he was still all-powerful, for they had met to hear his will read. Horace sat by the table with an angry"], [204, "188 'FOR PERCIVAL. line between his brows, and balanced a paper knife on his finger. He tried to appear composed, but a shiver of impatience ran through him more than once, and the colour came and went on his cheek. His mother was by his side, controlling her face to a rigidly funereal expression. But the effort was evident. Godfrey Hammond said to himself, ' Those two epXpect the worst. And if the worst comes, if Percival is mistaken, and Horace is cut off with just a pittance, we shall see what Hunting Harry's temper really is. We may have an unpleasant quarter of an hour, but it will give us a vivid idea of the end of the Millennium, I fancy.' Aunt Harriet was unfeignedly troubled and anpxious. Percival was rather in the background. Sitting on one chair, he laid his folded arms on the back of another, and rested his chin on his wrists. In this attitude he gazed at Hardwicke, with the utter calm of an Assyrian statue. He felt his pulses throb bing, and it seemed to him as if his anxiety must betray itself. But it did not If you have a little self-restraint and presence of mind, you can affect to have much. Percival had that little. Just before Hardwicke began to read,"], [205, "WHY NOT LOTTIE ? 189 Mrs. James leant towards her son, and whispered with an air of mystery. He answered with a short and sullen nod. Hardwicke read clearly but monotonously. The will was dated four days after Alfred Thome's death, not only before Percival came to Brackenhill, but before any over tures had been made to him. Mrs. Middle ton came first with a legacy of ,\u00a310,000, and a few things which the dead man knew she prized, their mother's portrait, and one or two memorials of himself. Sissy had ,\u00a35,000 and a small portion of the family jewels, which were very splendid. His godson, Godfrey Hammond, had three pictures and a ring, all of considerable value, and two or three other things, which, though of less importance, had been looked upon as heir looms by successive generations of Thornes. Hammond perfectly understood the wilful pride and remorseful pangs with which that bequest was made. Then came small legacies to old friends. Duncan the butler, and one or two of the elder servants had annuities, and the others were not forgotten. Two local charitable institutions had a hundred pounds each. By this time Horace was white to his very lips, and drawing his breath painfully. Percival"], [206, "190 FOR PERCIVAL. preserved an appearance of calm, but he could feel his strong irregular heart-throbs as he leant against the chair. The lawyer went on to read the words which gave Brackenhill to Horace for his life. If he died, and left no son to inherit the estate, it was to go to Percival Thorne. But unless Horace died first, and died child less, Percival would not take sixpence under his grandfather's will. It was a heavy blow, and his lips and hands tightened a little as he met it He had known that the great prize was for his cousin, but he had fancied that there might be some trifling legacy for him. He would have been more thankful than words could say, for half the annuity which was left to the butler. The remembrance of that paper, which but for him would have been all powerful, rose vividly before his eyes. Did he repent now that he was certain of the greatness of the sacrifice ? Again from the bottom of his heart he answered, No. But even while Hardwicke read the words which doomed him to beggary, it almost seemed to young Thorne as if the wrinkled waxen face and shrunken figure must suddenly become visible in the background to protest \u2014 as if a dead hand must be laid on that lying will"], [207, "WHY NOT LOTTIE ? 191 which was itself more dead than the newly buried corpse. Even in that bitter moment Percival was sorry for the poor old Squire. Hardwicke finished, and thought it all very well. He did not pity the young fellow opposite him, who had listened so intently, and now was looking thoughtfully into space. The lawyer summed up Percival's position in his own mind thus. He had an income of his own, amount unknown, but as, during Alfred Thome's life, it had sufficed for both, it must be more than enough to support the son. He was engaged to Sissy Langton. Her father had left her at least .\u00a3800 a year, besides which there were all the accumula tions of a long minority, and this legacy. Mr. Hardwicke thought that the united incomes would be more than .\u00a31,500 a year. There were expectations too. Mrs. Middleton was rich, and though some of her property would revert to her husband's family, Hardwicke knew that she had saved a considerable sum. He had no doubt that those savings, and her brother's ,\u00a310,000, would go to Sissy, and consequently to Percival. And lastly he looked at the new owner of Brackenhill. No, Mr. Hardwicke did not pity Mr. Percival Thorne."], [208, "' FOR PERCIVAL. 192 All these thoughts had flashed through his mind as he folded the paper and laid it down. Mrs. Middleton broke the silence. ' But Percival ' \u2014 she exclaimed in utter bewilderment. ' I don't understand. What does Percival have ? ' ' Nothing,' said the young man quickly, lifting his head and facing her with a brave smile. 'Nothing? It isn't possible ! It isn't right! ' ' That will was made before ever I came here. It doesn't mean any unkindness to me, for he didn't know me.' ' But did he never make another ! Horace! Oh, Mr. Hardwicke, you know Godfrey never meant this ! That was what his letter was about, then ? ' ' He intended to make some change, no doubt,' said Hardwicke. ' Perhaps Mr. Percival Thorne would like to dispute the will.' It was evident that Mrs. James perfectly comprehended the position. Aunt Harriet looked helplessly at her boy, unable to understand his silence. Horace, though unconscious of the glance, rose suddenly to his feet. ' I want to under stand,' he began in a high thin voice, an unnatural voice, which all at once grew hoarse. 'Yes \u2014 what?' said Hardwicke, looking"], [209, "WHY NOT LOTTIE ? 193 up at the young man who rested both his quivering hands on the table to support himself. All eyes were turned to the one erect figure. ' That,' \u2014 Horace nodded at the will, \u2014 ' That makes me master \u2014 eh ? ' ' Undoubtedly/ Hardwicke replied, won dering whether Horace was unusually slow of comprehension. ' Nothing can alter it ? ' said Horace. I may do what I please in everything ? ' I want to be sure.' ' You can't sell it, if you mean that,' said the lawyer. ' Didn't you understand ? You have only ' ' I know \u2014 I know that.' The interruption was hasty, as if the speaker would not be reminded of an unpleasant truth. Hardwicke's eyes rested on the two hands which were pressed on the table. They were painfully weak and white. ' You are master here,' he said gently. ' Certainly. Your grandfather has made no conditions whatever. Brackenhill is yours for your life.' Horace looked fixedly at him, and half opened his lips as if to speak, but no sound came. It was so evident that he had some thing to say that the others waited in strained VOL. LI.

' ' Leave me to manage it,' he answered, and drew his hand away, provoking a lofty ' Oh, very well.' He walked hurriedly to the hearth-rug, and stood in the master's place with an air of having taken possession. Hardwicke moved his chair a little, so as to look sideways at the new Squire. Hammond put up his glass. Mrs. James was like a living explanation of the text : ' As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead.' Though she was sulky, and persistently silent, there was a lurking triumph in her eyes, and it was easy to see that she listened eagerly for the words which seemed to die on her son's lips. He glanced quickly round, stepped back, and rested his elbow on the chimney-piece, so awkwardly that a small china cup fell, and was shivered to atoms on the hearth. ' Oh, Horace ! ' exclaimed Aunt Harriet. ' It's mine!' said the young man with a nervous little laugh. ' And \u2014 since Bracken hill is mine too, it is time that my wife should come home ! ' There was a startled movement, and a sudden exclamation of surprise, though it"], [211, "WHY NOT LOTTIE ? 195 would have been impossible to say who moved or spoke. ' Your wife ! Do you mean that you are going to be married ? ' said Hardwicke. 'No. I mean that I am married,' Horace replied. ' Oh, it's all right enough. I took care of that. You shall know all about it.' ' But how \u2014 when ? Who is she ? ' Mrs. Middleton had her hand on his arm, and was stammering in her eagerness. ' Oh, my dear boy, why didn't we know ? ' ' Because Mrs. Horace Thorne was Miss Adelaide Blake,\" said Hammond decisively. Horace turned upon him and said ' No,' and he was utterly confounded. ' But who then ? Tell us ! ' Horace looked at Percival, the only one who had been silent. ' Why not Lottie ? ' he said, and the tone was full of meaning. Percival stared at him for a moment, and then leapt to his feet. ' It isn't true ! ' he exclaimed. 'Indeed! And why not?' said Horace. ' If I may ask ' ' Lottie do anything underhand \u2014 Lottie \u2014 it can't be true !

' And as to anything underhand,' \u2014 Horace began fiercely. Aunt Harriet, scared by the menacing clash of words, uttered a faint little cry. ' Percival ! \u2014 Horace ! ' said Godfrey Ham mond. ' You forget what day this is \u2014 you forget Mrs. Middleton ! For God's sake, don't quarrel before her ! Horace, is this really true ? Is Lottie your wife ? ' ' Yes,' said the young man, turning quickly towards him. There was a sudden light of tenderness in his glance. ' Since last No vember.' He paused, and then added softly, 'the third,' as if the date were something sacred. ' Hammond, you know her, you know how young she is, only eighteen this month. If you choose to blame anyone, blame me. And I'm not ashamed of what I've done,' he looked defiantly round.

I've been watched, and lectured, and treated like an outsider, here, in my own home. You know it's true. And you know to whom I owe it. I never expected to have my rights ; I thought my grandfather would have no peace till I was driven out of Brackenhill. And even now I can't under stand how it is that I am master here.' Percival smiled again, to himself this time. ' But Lottie was willing to share my poverty \u2014 God bless her ! \u2014 and I won't let an hour go by without owning my wife.

And with a bow"], [214, "198 ' FOR PERCIVAL.' to the assembled company, young Thorne walked out of the room. Horace looked round to see how the attack was received. At Aunt Harriet, who was wiping away the quick coming tears \u2014 at Hardwicke, who was looking at the door through which Percival had vanished \u2014 at Hammond, who came forward a step or two. ' I ordered a dog-cart to come over from Fordborough for me,' he said. ' If you will allow me I will ring and have it brought round.' ' You are going ?' said Horace. ' We shall just catch the four-o'clock train very comfortably, if we go now,' Godfrey replied. ' Thorne will prefer going by that.' ' I see. You take his part. Very well, I suppose sooner or later you must choose between us \u2014 as well now as later.' Horace rang the bell. ' Horace,' said Hammond, dropping his voice, yet speaking in the same tone of authority he had used once before that day. ' For the first time in your life Mrs. Middleton is your guest. If you have a spark of right feeling \u2014 and you have more than that \u2014 you will not make her position here more painful than it must be. We will defer all discussion"], [215, "WHY NOT LOTTIE ? 199 \u2014 there must be a truce while she is here. (' My dog-cart,' he said over his shoulder to the servant. ' It was to come from Ford borough. At once.') Keep out of the way ten minutes hence, when your cousin goes,' he added to Horace. ' It will be best' The young Squire bent his head in sulky acquiescence. ' I shall take Percival with me,' said Hammond to Mrs. Middleton as he went by. ' He wants to be off, I know, and I shall be of more use with him than here.' He found Percival crushing his things into his little portmanteau, and in hot haste to get away from Brackenhill. ' I'm going by the four train,' Hammond remarked. ' And I've told them you'll drive with me.' ' In one of his carriages ? ' said young Thorne, looking up with furious eyes. ' No, thank you. I'll walk.' ' If you jumped out of that window, you wouldn't have to go down his staircase,' said Hammond. ' Oh, if you came here to ' began the young man, tugging at a strap.

' Percival, Mrs. Middleton is coming. I hear her step. For her sake \u2014 to-day \u2014 Thorne, you will not break her heart ? ' The old lady was knocking at the half open door. ' Come in,' said Percival in a gentle voice. His portmanteau was strapped, and he rose as she entered. ' Come to say good-bye to me, Aunt Harriet ? I'm off, you see.' ' Oh, Percival, I can't understand it ! ' she exclaimed. 'Horace married \u2014 married! And you going away like this ! It is like a dream ! ' ' So it seems to me,' said the young man. 'And one of those Miss Blakes! Oh, dear! What would Godfrey have said ? Oh, Percival, he never meant this ! ' She had her hand to her forehead as she spoke. 'No,' said Percival. ' But don't fret about me, I shall do very well.' ' But it isn't right ! Oh, I don't know"], [217, "WHY NOT LOTTIE ? 201 what to say or think I am so bewildered. Perhaps Horace has hardly had time to think yet, has he?' she said faintly. ' He will do something, I'm sure ' ' He mustn't \u2014 don't let him ! I can hold my tongue, if I'm let alone. But if he insults me ' \u2014 said Percival. ' Aunt Harriet, for God's sake, don't let him offer me money ! ' ' Ah ! ' in an accent of pain. ' But my money \u2014 Percival, do you want any?

But Lottie 1 liked Lottie ; we were very good friends when she was a school-girl. She is very young still. Perhaps she didn't understand. I ought to say this, because you never knew her, and I did.' And having said it he went away with a light on his sombre face. Mrs. Middleton looked up at Hammond with streaming eyes, and shook her head. ' I shall never like that girl \u2014 I shall never have anything to do with her. Godfrey was right.' ' In what way ? ' 'Percival was his favourite, always.' ' I'll look after him,' said Hammond, and, with a quick pressure of her hand, he followed the young man downstairs. As they drove away, Percival sat erect and grave, with a face as darkly still as if it were moulded in bronze. He went away from the dear old house, without one back ward glance : Horace might be looking out. He never spoke, and when they reached the station, he took his ticket and got into a carriage, without the least reference to Ham mond, who followed him quietly. There was"], [219, "WHY NOT LOTTIE ? 203 no one else with them. The silence was un broken till they drew near their journey's end, when Thorne took out his ticket and ex amined it curiously. ' I wonder if I shall ever see another,' he said. ' Another what ? ' ' First-class ticket. I ought to have gone third.' ' You get an opportunity of studying character, no doubt. But I think this is better to-day,' said Hammond. Percival was silent for a moment. Then he spread all his money on his open hand, and eyed it. ' What do you think of that for a fortune, eh, Godfrey ? ' Godfrey glanced at the little constellation of gold and silver coins. ' Wants a little more spending,' he said. ' Twopence half penny is the mystic sum which turns to millions. So Lisle has swindled you, has he ? I thought as much.' Percival nodded. ' Keep my secret. They shan't say that I lived on my grand father first, and then on Aunt Harriet \u2014 or Sissy. They may find it out later and welcome, if I have shown them that I can do without them all' ' Ah, yes,' said Hammond, a little vaguely. ' Here we are.'"], [220, "' FOR PERCIVAL. 204 CHAPTER XIII. LOTTIE WINS. Percival had not been wrong about Lottie ; she had at any rate only partially understood what she was doing. The poor child had been bitterly humiliated by the discovery that he did not love her, and felt that she was disgraced for life by her ill-judged ad vance. The feeling was high-flown and exaggerated, no doubt, but one hardly expects to find all the cool wisdom of Ecclesiastes in a brain of seventeen. Lottie, flying from Percival's scorn, as she supposed, was ready for any desperate leap. What wonder that she took one into Horace's open arms ? How could she find a better salve for wounded pride than by captivating the man who had passed her by as nothing but a child, and who had been, as she would have said, ' much too great a swell to take any notice of her}' He had dangled in a half-"], [221, "LOTTIE WINS ? 205 hearted fashion after Addie, and had given himself airs. Wounded vanity had attracted him to Lottie, but, smitten by sudden passion, he wooed her hotly, with an eagerness which startled even himself. How could she be unconscious of the difference, and of her triumph ? Percival, who had slighted her,- should see her reigning at Brackenhill Proud, pleased, grateful, excited, dizzy with success, Lottie was swept away by the torrent of mingled feelings. Her sorrow for her father's death was violent, but not lasting. She could not feel his loss for any length of time, she had always been so much more her mother's child. Even during her mourning there was something of romance in Horace's letters of comfort, for Horace, who had always been the laziest correspondent in the world, wrote ardent letters to Lottie, and used all the hackeyed, yet ever fresh, expedients for transmitting them which have been be queathed to us by generations of bygone lovers. There were meetings too, more romantic still. No one is so sentimental as the man who is startled out of a languid scorn of sentiment. He does not know where"], [222, "206 ' FOR PERCIVAL. to stop. Horace would have been capable of serenading Lottie, if Mrs. Blake would only have slept on the other side of the house. Addie was unconscious of the fiery romance which went on close at hand. She felt that the languid attentions which she had prized were fading away, and would never ripen to anything more. Her sorrow for her father's death was deeper than Lottie's, and while it was fresh she hardly thought of Horace Thome's coldness, except as a part of the general dreariness of life, and did not attempt to seek out its cause. Even Mrs. Blake never for a moment expected the revelation which was made to her near the beginning of October. It was Lottie who told her, coming to her one night, with a white face of agony and resolution. Horace was dangerously ill. He had been ill before, but this was something alto gether different. The cold which led to such alarming results had been caught in one of his secret expeditions to see Lottie. She had been forced to keep him waiting, and a chilly September rain had drenched him to the skin. He had gone away in his wet clothes, had tried to pretend that there was nothing"], [223, "LOTTIE WINS. 207 amiss with him, and had gone out the next day, in order to be able to attribute his cold to a ride in the north-east wind. Since that time Lottie had had three letters ; the first a gallant little attempt at gaiety and hopeful ness, the second, after a considerable interval, depressed and an.xious. They had ordered him abroad. ' I am sure they think badly of me,' he wrote ; ' though I'll cheat the grave yet \u2014 if I can. But how am I to live through the winter in some horrible hole of a place without my darling ? Suppose I get worse, instead of better, and die out there, and never see you again \u2014 never once ! ' And so on for a page of forebodings. Lottie's fond ness for him, fanned by pity and remorse \u2014 was it not for her that he had risked his life ? \u2014 flamed up to passion. They say that a woman always puts the real meaning of her letter into the postscript. I don't know how that may be, but I do not think she would ever fail to give full weight to any postscript she might receive. Horace's postscript was, 'After all, I've a great mind to stay in England, and chance it' Lottie was terrified. She replied, wildly entreating him to go, and vowing that they should meet again, and not be parted. She did not yet know what she would do, but"], [224, "208 ' FOR PERCIVAL. . Then followed a few notes of music roughly dashed in. He was puzzled. He tried the notes furtively on the piano, but they told him nothing. That day, however, there came to his mother's house a girl, with whom he had had one of his numerous flirtations in bygone days. He asked her to play to him, and then to sing, hanging over the piano mean- while, and thrilling her with his apparent devotion, and with the melancholy which reminded her of the fate which threatened him. When she had finished her song, he said, ' But you'll sing me one more, won't you ? I shan't have the chance again, you know.' Pie looked down as he spoke, and struck the notes which haunted him. ' Do you know what that is ? ' he asked. ' It has been going in my head all day, and I can't put a name to it' She tried it after him. 'What is it?' she said; T ought to re- member,' and paused, finger on lip. Horace's eager eyes flashed upon hers, .when she suddenly exclaimed, ' I know. It's one of Chappell's old songs,' and, dashing her hands victoriously upon the keys, she sang ' Love will find out the way.' 'Ah!' said Horace, and stood erect, in a glow of passion and triumph. He remem-"], [225, "LOTTIE WINS. 209 bered himself enough to ask again for one more song ; but when with a wistful tremor in her voice, she said ' This ? you used to like this,' he assented, without an idea what it was, and dropped into the nearest arm-chair to ponder Lottie's message. He was quite unconscious that the girl at his side was singing ' O Fair Dove ! O Fond Dove ! ' with an earnestness of meaning, a pathos, and a power, which she never attained before or since. But he was sorry when she stopped, for he had to come out of a most wonderful castle in the air, and say ' Thank you.' When she went away, he looked vaguely at her and let her hand fall, as was only natural. How we listen for the postman when we are longing for a letter, and sick with hope deferred ! But who thinks of him when he has dropped it into the box, and is going down the street ? Horace felt almost sure, as he said goodbye, that Love had found out the way. And his next note sent Lottie to her mother. Mrs. Blake was utterly confounded when her younger daughter announced that she was engaged to Horace Thorne.

People can't live very much longer when they are seventy-seven, can they ? At least they do sometimes, I know,' Lottie added, pulling herself up. ' You see them in the newspapers sometimes in their ninety-eighth or ninety seventh year, I've noticed lately. But I'm sure it will be very wicked if he lives twenty years more. And now Horace is ill, and we can't wait. For he must not, and shall not, go away, and perhaps die without me.' And Lottie broke down and wept. ' But what do you want to do ? ' said Mrs. Blake. It was a shock to her, and she was sorry for Addie ; but she could not repress a thrill of exultation at the thought that Horace Thorne, whom she had so coveted for a son-in-law, was caught. The state of his health was serious, of course ; but they must hope for the best, and the idea of an alliance with one of the leading county families dazzled her. ' We want to be married before he goes out, and nobody to know anything about it, said Lottie ; ' and then you must take me abroad this winter.'"], [227, "LOTTIE WINS. 211 Mrs. Blake declared that it was utterly impossible. ' Oh, very well,' said Lottie, drying her tears. ' Then I give you fair warning. I shall run away, and get to Horace somehow.

Well then, it will be your doing, you know, if we are not. I shouldn't like to have such a thing on my conscience,' said Lottie, virtuously. ' But perhaps you don't mind.' Mrs. Blake said that it was impossible that Lottie could be so lost to all sense of propriety, so wicked, so unwomanly The girl stood opposite, slim, white, and resolute. Her slender hands hung loosely clasped before her, and a fierce spark burned in her eyes. ' Oh, that's impossible too \u2014 is it ? ' she said quietly. ' We'll see.' Mrs. Blake quailed, but'murmured some thing about her ' authority.' ' Oh, yes,' was the calm reply. ' You might lock me up. Try it \u2014 I think I should get out.

Help me, mother, for I love him ! ' The argument was prolonged, but the end could not be doubtful. Mrs. Blake could scold and bluster, but Lottie was determined, The mother was in bondage to Mrs. Grundy , the daughter played the trump card of her utter recklessness, and won the game. Having yielded, Mrs. Blake threw herself heart and soul into the scheme. She announced that painful recollections made Fordborough impossible as a place of residence, that Lottie was looking ill, and that they both required a thorough change. She dropped judiciously disagreeable re marks about her stepson, till Addie was up in arms, and said that her mother and Lottie might go where they liked, but she should go to her aunt, Miss Blake, till Oliver, who was on his way, came home. Then Mrs. Blake shut up her house, and went quietly off to Folkestone. Horace was to start from"], [229, "LOTTIE WINS. 213 Dover, in rather more than a fortnight's time. After that the course was clear. Horace found out that he was worse, and must put off his departure for a week or ten days. Then, when the time originally fixed arrived, he said that he was better, and would start at once. Naturally, Mrs. James was not ready ; and he discovered that the house was intolerable with her dressmakers and packing, that he must break the journey somewhere, and that he might as well wait for her at Dover. The morning after his arrival there, he took the train to Folkestone, met Lottie and her mother, went straight to the church, and came back to Dover, a lonely but trium phant bridegroom, while Mrs. Blake and Mrs. Horace Thorne crossed at once to Boulogne. It was necessary that Mrs. James should be enlightened, but Horace was not alarmed, he knew that she had no choice but to make common cause with him. Mrs. Blake, however, could not make up her mind what should be done with Addie. She more than suspected that the tidings would be a painful humiliation to her daughter. ' We mustn't tell her,' she said at last to Lottie. ' She might be spiteful \u2014 it wouldn't be safe.'"], [230, "214 FOR PERCIVAL. ' It will be quite safe,' said Lottie. ' Because of what we used to say about Horace, you mean ? But that is just what makes it safe. I know Addie ; she won't let any one say that she betrayed me, because she wanted Horace herself once. She said she didn't, but I think there was something in it ; and if there was, she'd be torn in pieces sooner than let any one say so.' There was a curious straightforwardness about Lottie, even while she schemed and plotted. She calculated the effect of her sister's tenderness for Horace as frankly and openly as one might reckon on a tide or a train, and behaved as if the old saying, ' All is fair in love and war,' were one of the Thirty-nine Articles. She wrote her letter without difficulty or hesitation. It was after Horace had joined them, and he laid his hand lightly on her shoulder, as she was contemplating her new signature. ' Neatly done ? ' he said. ' And who is to have the benefit of all this ? ' ' Addie. She ought to know.' ' Ah ! ' There was something of un easiness in his tone, as if an unpleasant idea had been presented to him.

But when she told him she had writ ten to Addie, the matter wore a less heroic aspect. Lottie might be unconscious of this in her sweet sincerity, thought the ardent lover, but he remembered old days, and felt like anything but a hero. ' Do you want to see what I have said ? ' She tilted her chair backwards, and looked up at him with her great clear eyes. ' No,' Horace answered with a smile. ' I'm not going to pry into your letters.' In his heart he knew that it was impossible to put the revelation of their secret to Addie into any words that would not be painful to him to read. Shall I give any message for you ? ' N-no,' said Horace, doubtfully, I think not. ' It might be considered more civil if you sent one.' ' Then say anything you please,' was the half-reluctant rejoinder. ' Oh, I'm not going to invent your messages \u2014 -you lazy boy ! A likely story ! ' Lottie sprang up, and put the pen into his hand. ' There \u2014 write for yourself, sir.'"], [234, "216 ' FOR PERCIVAL. Horace thought that a refusal would betray his feelings about Addie, and he sat down, wondering what he was going to say. But his eye was caught by the last two words of the letter, ' Lottie Thorne ; ' and, as he looked at them, the young husband forgot Addie, and his lips curved in a tender smile. ' Make haste,' said Lottie from the window ; ' make haste and come to me.' Horace started from his happy reverie, set his teeth, and wrote : \u2014 ' Dear Addie, ' I suppose Lottie has told you everything. It was a reckless thing to do, no doubt ; perhaps you will say it was wrong and underhand. Some people will, I dare say ; but I hope you won't, for I should like to start with your good wishes. May I call myself ' Your brother, ' H. T. ? In due time came the answer \u2014 ' Dear Horace, ' I will not pass judgment on you and your doings. I am not clever in argu ing such matters.

We are having very cold damp weather, so I am glad you are safe in a warmer climate, and hope you are the better for it. ' Your affectionate sister, ' Adelaide Blake.' Horace showed this to Lottie, and then thrust it away, and forgot it all as quickly as he could. Addie had read this little scrap in her own room, had stood for a moment staring at it, had kissed it suddenly, then torn it into a dozen pieces and stamped upon it Then she gathered up the fragments, sighed over them, burnt them, and vowed she would think no more of it or him. But as she went about the house there floated con tinually before her eyes, ' Your brother, ' H.

He fully thought, as he had said, that he was Esau, and that smooth Jacob would win a large share of the inherit ance ; but when he stood with his back to the fireplace at Brackenhill, and knew that he was master of all, Percival's parting sneer awoke his old doubts as to his heroism once more. He had succeeded too well, and the risk which had ennobled his conduct in his own eyes would never be realised by others. Percival's attempt to supplant him had been foiled, and Horace was triumphant ; yet he regretted the glaring contrast in their posi tions which rendered comparisons of their respective merits inevitable. But he could do nothing. Percival had said, ' Don't let him offer me money.' Horace, keener sighted than Aunt Harriet, had not the slightest intention of doing so. He knew how such overtures would be received, and, after all, Brackenhill was his by right. And had not Percival plenty to live on ? And as for himself, let who would turn their backs on him, even Aunt Harriet, if it must be so. He had Lottie, and could defy the world."], [237, "219 CHAPTER XIV. A start in life. For some days after he left Brackenhill, Percival was busy arranging his affairs. His ruin was remarkably complete. He had been running up bills in every direction during the last month or two, intending to pay for every thing, before his marriage, out of the funds which were in Mr. Lisle's hands. He had plenty there, he knew, for his method of saving had been to live principally on his grandfather's supplies, and to leave his own to accumulate under his guardian's care, a plan which had always seemed to him admirably simple \u2014 as indeed it had proved to be. Lately he had not received much from the Squire, because the old man so fully intended to provide for his favourite once and for all, on the approaching wedding-day.

It was after dinner. Hammond filled his glass and pushed the bottle to his guest. ' What do you mean to do ? ' he asked. ' Ah \u2014 that's the question.

As you say, it is attainable here. Will you turn tutor ? ' Percival winced. ' That sort of thing isn't easy to get into, is it ? I doubt if I've the least aptitude for teaching ; and I never went to college. I should be a very inferior article \u2014 not hall-marked.' ' Then write,' said Godfrey.

I can write, at any rate, so that will be an honest way of getting my living \u2014 the only one I can see.'' Hammond was startled and expostulated, but in vain. The relief of a decision was so great that Percival clung to it. Hammond talked of a situation in a bank, but Percival hated figures. His scheme gave him a chance of cutting himself loose from all former associations, and beginning a new, unknown and lonely life. ' No one will take any notice of a lawyer's clerk,' he said. ' I want to get away and hide myself. I don't want to go into anything where I shall be noticed, and encouraged, and expected to rise \u2014 don't let anyone ever expect me to rise, for I certainly shan't \u2014 nor where anyone can say \" That is Thorne of Brackenhill's grand son.\" I'm shipwrecked, and I've no heart for new ventures.'"], [241, "A START IN LIFE. 223 ' Not just at present,' said Godfrey.

There's no chance for the man who not only hasn't the necessary keenness, but wouldn't like to have it. If you want to say \" More fool you,\" you may.' Hammond shrugged his shoulders, and shook his head. ' Stick to your money, Godfrey,' said Thorne with a melancholy smile, ' or you'll feel some day as if the ground were cut away from under your feet.

I must try to stand by myself first.' Godfrey wrote, and Percival sat with bent head, poring over the little note which Sissy had sent, to entreat that the past might be forgotten. ' Let me do something for you,' she wrote. ' Come back to me, Percival, if you have forgiven me, and you said you had.

But, Sissy, you wouldn't have written so to me, if I had been a rich man as you hoped I should be, and I can't take from your sweet pity, what you couldn't give me when I asked it for love's sake. It is impossible, dear, but I thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I love you for it. I hardly know yet where I shall go and what I shall do ; but if I should want any help I will ask it first of you, and I will be your friend and brother to my dying day.' Thus he closed the page of his life on which he had written that brief story of love, yet Sissy's letter was an inexpressible comfort to him. It was something to know that elsewhere a little heart was beating, so true and kind that it would have given up its own happiness to help him in his trouble.

Never, I think, could a young hero have set forth to make his way through the world with less hope than did Percival Thorne. He was already disheartened and disgusted, and questioned within himself whether life were worth having, for those who went third class. The slow train, and the lagging hours, crawled onward through the dust and heat. ' And this,' he thought, ' should have been my wedding day ! ' q 2"], [246, "228 ' FOR TERCIVAL. CHAPTER XV.

Lottie reigned at Brackenhill ; and Mrs. Middleton, whose heart clung to the neighbourhood where she had lived so long, had taken a house on the other side of Fordborough. Between it and her old home lay an impassable gulf, none the less real that it was not marked on the county map. It appeared there as a distance of five miles and a quarter, with a good road, but Mrs. Horace Thorne, as well as Mrs. Middleton, knew better. Lottie laughed, and Horace's resentment was so keen that he was almost unconscious of his pain. Percival's utter disappearance was a nine days' wonder in Fordborough ; and, when curiosity was dying out, it flamed up again on the discovery that the marriage was not only put off, but was off altogether. This"], [247, "NO. 13, BELLEVUE STREET. 229 fact, considered in connection with the old Squire's will, gave rise to the idea that there was something queer about Mr. Percival Thorne, that he had been found out at the last moment, and had lost both wife and legacy in consequence. ' No doubt it was hushed up, on condition he should take himself off. The best thing they could do, but how sad for an old county [family ! Still there will be black sheep, and what a mercy it was that Miss Langton was saved from him !' So people talked, and generally added that they could not tell why \u2014 just a feeling, you know \u2014 but they never had liked that Percival Thorne. In September Godfrey Hammond cut a tiny slip out of the Times, and sent it to the banished man. 'On the 15th, the wife of Horace Thorne, Esq., Brackenhill, Fordborough, of a son.' Percival ate his breakfast that morning with the scrap of paper by his plate, and looked at it with fierce, defiant eyes. Lottie was avenged indeed, she would never know how bitterly. He had sworn that he would never think of Brackenhill, yet, with out his knowledge, it had been the back ground to his thoughts of everything. And"], [248, "' FOR PERCIVAL. 230 now the cruel injustice of his fate had taken a new lease of life in this baby boy ; it would outlive him, it would become eternal.

And I don't suppose he'll ever know what a scoundrel his father was ! ' So saying he glanced at his watch, and marched off to his work. Those three months had left their trace on him. He loathed his life ; he had no companions, no hope ; he was absorbed in the effort to endure his suffering. His indolence made his daily labour hateful as the treadmill. He was fastidious, and his surroundings sickened him. His food disgusted him, and so did sthe close atmo sphere of the office. But he had chosen his fate, and he had no heart to try to escape from it, since it gave him the means of keep ing body and soul together. Day after day as that hot September wore away, he looked out on a dreary range of roofs and chimney pots. He learned to know, and hate, every broken tile. From his bedroom he looked into a narrow backyard, deep, like a well, at the bottom of which children swarmed, uncleanly and unwholesome ; and women"], [249, "NO. 13, BELLEVUE STREET. 231 gossiped and wrangled, as they hung out dingy rags to dry. The fierce sun shone on it all, and on Percival as he leant at his window, surveying it with disgust, yet some thing of fascination too. ' I fancied the sun wouldn't seem so bright in holes like this,' he mused. ' I thought everything would be. dull and dim. Instead of which, he glares into every cranny and corner, as if he were pointing at all the filth and squalid misery, and makes it ten times more abominable.' Nor did the slanting rays light up anything pleasant and fresh in the bedroom itself. It was shabby and small, with coarsely papered walls, and a discoloured ceiling. Percival remarked that his window had a very wide sill. He never found out the reason, unless it were intended that he should take the air by sitting on it, and dangling his legs over the foulest of waterbutts. But when night came, the broad sill was the favourite battle field for all the cats in the neighbourhood. It might have been pointed out, as readily as they point you out the place where the students fight at Heidelberg. From his sitting-room he looked on a melancholy street. The unsubstantial houses tried to seem \u2014 not respectable, no word so honest could be applied to them \u2014 but genteel,"], [250, "' FOR PERCIVAL. 232 and failed even in that miserable ambition. Percival used to watch the plastered fronts, flaking in the sun and rain, old while yet new, with no grace of bygone memory, or present strength, till he fancied that they might be perishing of some foul leprosy, like that described in Leviticus. And the weari some monotony ! They were all just alike, except that here and there one was a little dingier than its neighbours, with the railings more broken, and the windows dirtier. One day, when his landlady insisted on talking to him, and Percival was too courteous to be absolutely silent, he asked where the prospect was, from which the street took its name. She said they used to be able to see Three Corner Green from their attic windows. In her mother's time there was a tree and a pond there, she believed ; and she herself could remember it quite green, a great place for Cheap Jacks, and people who preached, and sold pills. But now it was all done away with, and built over. It was Paradise Place, and Paradise Place wasn't much of a prospect, though there might be worse. But it was no detriment to Mr. Thome's rooms, for it was only the attic that ever had the view.

This sounded so like the beginning of a dis course on things in general, that Percival thanked her and fled. It was about ten minutes' walk to Mr. Ferguson's office. There, week after week, he toiled with dull industry. He could not believe that his drudgery would last ; some thing \u2014 death perhaps \u2014 must come to break the monotony of that slowly unwinding chain of days, which was like a grotesquely dreary dream. To have flung himself heart and soul into his work, not only demanded an effort of which he felt himself incapable, but it seemed to him that such an effort could only serve to identify him with this hideous life. So, with head bowed over interminable pages, he laboured with patient indifference. On his left sat a clerk, ten or fifteen years older than himself a white-faced man, who blinked like an owl in sunlight, and had a wearisome cough. There was always a sickly smell of lozenges about him, and he was fret ful if every window were not tightly closed. On Percival's right was a sallow youth of nineteen. He worked by fits and starts, sometimes driving his pen along as if the well-being of the universe depended on the"], [252, "'FOR PERCIVAL. 234 swift completion of his task, and the planets might cease to revolve if he were idle, while a few minutes later he would be drawing absently on his blotting-paper, or feeling for his whiskers, as if they might have arrived suddenly without his being aware of it. Probably he was thinking over his nepXt speech at the Young Men's Mutual Im provement Society. They debated high and important matters at their weekly meetings. They inquired, ' Was Oliver Cromwell justified in putting King Charles to death?' they read interesting papers about it, and voted the unlucky monarch into, or out of, his grave, with an energy which would have allowed him little rest, if it could have taken effect. They marshalled many arguments to decide the knotty and important question, ' Does our Country owe most to the Warrior or the Statesman ? ' and they made up their minds and voted about that, too. The sallow young man was rather a distinguished mem ber of the society, and had much to say on such problems as these. The clerks did not like Thorne. They felt that he was not one of themselves, and said that he was stuck-up and sulky. They resented his silence. If you do not like a man, you always understand his silence as"], [253, "NO. 13, BELLEVUE STREET. 235 the speech you would most dislike \u2014 veiled. Above all, they resented his grave politeness. They left him alone, with an angry suspicion that it was exactly what he wanted them to do, as indeed it was, though he was painfully conscious of the atmosphere of distrust and ill-will in which he lived. But he could have found no pleasure in their companionship, and, in fact, was only interested in their coats. He was anxious to learn how shabby a man might become, and pass unnoticed in the office, so he would glance, without turning his head, at the white-faced man's sleeve, and rejoice to see the same threadbare cuff travelling slowly across a wide epXpanse of parchment. When he wrote to Hammond, he said that he was getting on very well. He could not say that his work was very amusing, but very likely he should get more used to it in time. He wished to be left alone, and to give it a fair trial. How was Sissy ? Hammond replied that Mrs. Middleton had aged a good deal, but that she and Sissy were both pretty well, and had got an idea \u2014 he could not think from whom \u2014 that Percival had gone in for the law, and was going to do something very amazing indeed. ' They are waiting to be surprised,' Godfrey"], [254, "236 ' FOR PERCIVAL. wrote, ' like children on their birthdays.

Mrs. Middleton is perhaps a trifle more moderate in her expectations. I left them to build their castles in the air, since you had bound me to secrecy ; but I wish you would tell them the truth. Or I would help you, as you know, if I knew how.' Percival answered that Godfrey must not betray him. ' I couldn't endure that Horace and his wife should know of my difficulties, and as to living on Aunt Harriet \u2014 never. And how could I go back to Fordborough now that Sissy and I have parted ? She would sacrifice herself for me \u2014 poor child \u2014 \u25a0 out of sheer pity. No \u2014 here I can live, after a fashion, and defy the world.

It was irrational no doubt, but Thorne had a right to please himself,"], [255, "NO. 13, BELLEVUE STREET. 237 and might as well take care of his pride, since he had not much else to take care of. So he attempted no persuasion, but simply sent any Fordborough news, and forwarded occasional letters from Mrs. Middleton and Sissy. As the autumn wore on, Percival began to feel strange as he opened the en velopes, and saw the handwriting which belonged to his old life. He had an absurd idea that the letters should not have come to him, that his former self, the self Sissy had known, was gone. He read her letters by the light of what Hammond had told him, and saw the delicate wording, by which she tried to show her sympathy, yet almost repelled his confidence. She was so anxious not to thrust herself into his secrets, it was so evident that she would not be troublesome, but would wait with shut eyes, as Hammond had said, for a birthday surprise and triumph! O poor little Sissy ! O faith, which he felt within himself no strength to vindicate ! He answered her in carefully weighed sentences, and smiled as he wrote them down, because they amused him \u2014 a smile sadder than tears. Percival Thorne was dead, and he was some one else, trying to think what Percival would have said, and to hide his death from Sissy, lest her heart should break for pity."], [256, "238 ' FOR PERCIVAL.' It was very foolish ? Yes. But if you had parted yourself from every one you knew ; if for five months you had never heard a friendly word ; if you had a secret to hide, and a part to play ; if you lived alone, sur rounded by faces of people with whom you had no faintest touch of sympathy, faces which were to you like those of swarming Chinese, or men and women in a nightmare \u2014 perhaps you might have some thoughts and fancies less calm and less rational than of old. And the more changed Percival felt himself, the more he shrank from the friends he had left. November came. One day he looked at the date on the office almanac, and remem bered that it was exactly a year since he went down to Brackenhill, and heard of old Bridgman's death. He could not repress a short sudden laugh. It was half under his breath, but his neighbour who was at that moment gazing fiercely into space, and turn ing a sentence, heard it, and felt that it was in mockery of him. Percival was thinking how seriously he had considered that im portant question, ' Would he stand as the Liberal candidate for Fordborough ? ' Percival Thorne, Esq., M.P. He might well laugh, as he sat at his desk, filling in a bundle of"], [257, "NO. 13, BELLEVUE STREET. 239 notices. But, from that moment, the sallow youth on his right hated him with a deadly hatred. December came, a dull, grey, bitter December. Not clear and sparkling, as December sometimes is, nor yet misty, and warm, as if it would have you take it for a lingering autumn, but bitter without beauty, harsh and pitiless. Keen gusts of wind whirled dust, and straws, and rubbish in dreary little dances along Bellevue Street ; the faces of the passers-by were nipped and miserable with the cold, and the sullen sky hung low above the pallid row of houses opposite. Percival looked out on this, and thought of Brackenhill, which he left in leafy June. He was very miserable, he had always been quickly sensitive to the beauty or dreariness around him, and the grey dulness of the scene entered into his very soul. Warmth, leisure, sunlight, and blue sky \u2014 there was plenty of sunlight somewhere in the world \u2014 O God ! what had he done that it should be denied him ! There was a weary craving upon him that might have led to terrible results, but his pride and fastidiousness saved him. His delicately cultivated palate loathed the coarse fire of spirits, and he had a healthy horror of"], [258, "240 ' FOR PERCIVAL. drugs. Once or twice he had thought of opium, when he could not escape, even in dreams, from the greyness of his life. ' This is unendurable,' he would say, and he played in fancy with the key which unlocks the gates of that strange region, lying on the borders of Paradise and Hell. But his better sense questioned, ' Will it be any more endurable when I have ruined my nerves and the coats of my stomach ? ' It did not seem probable that it would be. If death had been the risk, he might have fancied it ; but he recoiled from the thought of a premature and de graded old age, still chained to the hateful desk. There are times when a man may be cheaply made into a hero. What would not Percival have given for the chance of doing some deed of reckless bravery ?"], [259, "241 CHAPTER XVI.

Percival could not fix the precise date, but he knew it was early in the month, because about the 8th or 9th he was suddenly aware that he had more than once encountered a smile, a long curl, and a pair of turquoise earrings on the stairs. He had noticed the earrings, he could speak positively as to them. He had seen turquoises before, and taken little heed of them, but possibly his friends had happened to buy rather small ones. He felt pretty certain about the long curl. And he thought there was a smile, but he was not so abso lutely sure of the smile. By the 12th he was quite sure of it. It seemed to him that it was cold work for any one to be so continually on the stairs in December. The owner of the smile had said ' Good morning, Mr. Thorne.' vol. 11.

That evening he left the office to the minute, and hurried to Bellevue Street. He got half way up the stairs and met no one, but he heard a voice on the landing exclaim, ' Go to old Fordham's caddy, then, for you shan't \u2014 oh good gracious ! ' and there was a hurried rustle. He went more slowly the rest of the way, reflecting. Fordham was another lodger, elderly, as the voice had said. Percival went to his sitting-room, and looked thoughtfully into his tea-caddy. It was nearly half full, and he calculated that, according to the ordinary rate of con sumption, it should have been empty, and yet he had not been more sparing than usual. His landlady had told him where to get his tea ; she said she found it cheap ; it was a fine-flavoured tea, and she always drank it. Percival supposed so, and wondered where old Fordham got his tea, and whether that was fine-flavoured too."], [261, "OF THE LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER. 243 There was a giggle outside the door, a knock, and in answer to Percival's ' Come in,' the landlady's daughter appeared. She explained that Emma had gone out shopping \u2014 Emma was the grimy girl who ordinarily waited on him \u2014 so, with a nervous little laugh, with a toss of the long curl, which was supposed to have got in the way somehow, and with the turquoise earrings quivering in the candle light, she brought in the tray. She conveyed by her manner that it was a new and amusing experience in her life, but that the burden was almost more than her strength could support, and that she required assistance. Percival, who had stood up when she came in, and thanked her gravely from his position on the hearthrug, came forward and swept some books and papers out of the way, to make room for her load. In so doing their hands touched, his white and beautifully shaped, hers clumsy and coarsely coloured. (It was not poor Lydia's fault She had written to more than one of those amiable editors, who devote a column or two in family magazines to settling questions of etiquette, giving recipes for pomades and puddings, and telling you how you may take stains out of silk, get rid of freckles, or know whether a young man K 2"], [262, "' FOR FERCIVAL. 244 means anything by his attentions. There had been a little paragraph, beginning ' L.'s hands are not as white as she could wish, and she asks us what she is to do. We can only recommend,' &c. Poor L. had tried every recommendation in faith and in vain, and was in a fair way to learn the hope lessness of her quest.) The touch thrilled her with pleasure, and Thorne with repugnance. He drew back, while she busied herself in arranging his cup, saucer, and plate. She dropped the spoon on the tray, scolded herself for her own stupidity, looked up at him with a hurried apology, and laughed. If she did not blush, she conveyed by her manner a sort of idea of blushing, and went out of the room with a final giggle, being confused by his opening the door for her. Percival breathed again, relieved from an oppression, and wondered what on earth had made her take an interest in his tea and him. Yet the reason was not far to seek. It was that tragic, melancholy hero's face of his \u2014 he felt so little like a hero, that it was hard for him to realize that he looked like one \u2014 his sombre eyes, which might have been those of an exile thinking of his home, the air of proud and rather old-fashioned courtesy,"], [263, "OF THE LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER. 245 which he had inherited from his grandfather the Rector, and developed for himself. Every girl is ready to find something of the prince in one who treats her with deference, as if she were a princess. Percival had an unconscious grace of bearing and attitude, and the considerable advantage of well-made clothes. Poverty had not yet reduced him to cheap coats, and advertised trousers. And per haps the crowning fascination in poor Lydia's eyes was the slight, dark, silky moustache, which emphasised, without hiding his lips. Another rustling outside, a giggle and a whisper \u2014 Percival would have sworn that the whisper was Emma's, if it had been possible that she could have left it behind her when she went out shopping \u2014 an ejaculation, ' Gracious ! I've blacked my hand ! ' a pause, presumably for the purpose of removing the stain, and Lydia reappeared with the kettle. She poured a portion of its contents over the fender, in her anxiety to plant it firmly on the fire. ' Oh dear,' she exclaimed, ' how stupid of me ! Oh, Mr. Thorne ! ' this half archly, half pensively, fingering the curl, and surveying the steaming pool, ' I'm afraid you'll wish Emma hadn't gone out \u2014 such a mess as I've made of it. What will you think of me ! '"], [264, "246 ' FOR PERCIVAL.' ' Pray don't trouble yourself,' said Percival. ' The fender can't signify, except perhaps from Emma's point of view. It doesn't interfere with my comfort, I assure you.' She departed, only half convinced. Percival, with another sigh of relief, pro ceeded to make the tea. The water was boiling, and the fire good. Emma was apt to set a chilly kettle on a glimmering spark, but Lydia treated him better. The bit of cold meat on the table looked bigger than he expected, the butter wore a cheerful sprig of green. Percival saw his advantages ; but he thought them dearly bought, especially as he had to take a turn up and down Bellevue Street, while the table was cleared. After that day it was astonishing how often Emma went out shopping, or was busy, or had a bad finger, or a bad foot, or was helping Ma with something or other, or hadn't made herself tidy, so that Lydia had to wait on Mr. Thorne. But it was always with the same air of its being something very droll and amusing to do, and there were always some artless mistakes, which required giggling apologies. Nor could he doubt that he was in her thoughts during his absence. She had a piano downstairs, on which she accompanied herself as she sang, but she"], [265, "OF THE LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER. 247 found time for domestic cares. His buttons were carefully sewn on, and his fire was always bright. One evening his table was adorned with a bright blue vase \u2014 as blue as Lydia's earrings \u2014 filled with dried grasses, and paper flowers. He gazed blankly at it, in unspeakable horror, and then paced up and down the room, wondering how he should endure life with it continually before his eyes. Some books lay on a side table, and as he passed he looked absently at them and halted. On his Shelley, slightly askew, as if to preclude all thought of care and design, lay a little volume, bound in dingy white and gold. Percival did not touch it, but he stooped and read the title, The Language of Flowers, and saw that \u2014 purely by accident of course \u2014 a leaf was doubled down as if to mark a place. He straight tened himself again, and his proud lip curled in disgust, as he glanced from the tawdry flowers to the tawdry book. And from below came suddenly the jingling notes of Lydia's piano, and Lydia's voice, not exactly harsh, and only occasionally out of tune, but with something hopelessly vulgar in its intonation, singing her favourite song : \u2014 Oh, if I had some one to love me, My troubles and trials to share."], [266, "248 ' FOR PERCIVAL. Percival turned his back on the blue vase and the little book, and flinging himself into a chair before the fire, sickened at the thought of the life he was doomed to lead. Lydia, who was just mounting with a little uncertainty to a high note, was a good girl in her way, and good-looking, and had a kind sympathy for him in his evident loneliness. But was she to be the highest type of womanhood that he would meet henceforth ? And was Bellevue Street to be his world ? He glided into a mournful dream of Brackenhill, which would never be his, and of Sissy, who had loved him so well, yet failed to love him altogether \u2014 Sissy who had begged for her freedom with such tender pain in her voice, while she pierced him so cruelly with her frightened eyes. Percival looked very stern in his sadness, as he sat brooding over his fire, while from the room below came a triumphant burst of song \u2014 But I will marry my own love, For true of heart am I. Sometimes he would picture to himself the future which lay before Horace's three months old child, whose little life played so all-important a part in his own destiny. He had questioned Hammond about him."], [267, "OF THE LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER. 249 and Hammond had replied that he heard that Lottie and the boy were both doing well. ' They say that the child is a regular Blake, just like Lottie herself,' said Godfrey; ' and doesn't look like a Thorne at all.' Percival thought, not unkindly, of Lottie's boy, of Lottie's great clear eyes in an innocent baby face, and imagined him growing up, slim and tall, to range the woods of Bracken hill in future years, as Lottie herself had wandered in the copses about Fordborough. And yet sometimes he could not but think of the change that it might make, if little James William Thorne were to die. Horace was very ill, they said ; Brackenhill was shut up, and they had all gone to winter abroad. The doctors had declared that there was not a chance for him in England. At this time Percival kept a sort of rough diary. Here is a leaf from it : \u2014 ' I am much troubled by a certain little devil, who comes as soon as I am safely in bed, and sits on my pillow. He flattens it abominably, or else I do it myself, tossing about in my impatience. He is quite still for a minute or two, and I try my best to think he isn't there at all. Then he stoops down and whispers in my ear \"Convulsions !\" and starts up again like india-rubber. I won't"], [268, "250 'FOR PERCIVAL. listen.

I think of old days with my father, when I knew nothing of Brackenhill ; I try to remember my mother's face \u2014 I am getting on very well. But all at once I become conscious that he has been for some time murmuring as to himself, \" Whooping cough and scarlet fever \u2014 scarlet fever.\" I grow fierce, and say, \" I pray God he may escape them all ! \" To which he softly replies, \"His grandfather died \u2014 his father is dying \u2014 of decline.\" ' I roll over to the other side, and encounter him, or his twin brother, there. A perfectly silent little devil this time, with a faculty for calling up pictures. He shows me the office \u2014 I see it \u2014 I smell it, with its flaring gaslights, and sickly atmosphere. Then he shows me the long drawing-room at Bracken hill, the quaint old furniture, the pictures on the walls, the terrace, with its balustrade and balls of mossy stone, and through the windows come odours of jasmine, and roses, and far-off fields, while inside there is the sweetness of dried blossoms and spices, in"], [269, "OF THE LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER. 251 the great china jars. A moment more, and it is Bellevue Street, with its rows of hideous, whited houses. And then again it is a river, curving swiftly and grandly be tween its castled rocks \u2014 or a bridge of many arches, in the twilight, and the lights coming out one by one in the old walled town, and road and river, travelling one knows not where, into regions just falling asleep in the quiet dusk. Or there is a holiday crowd, a moonlit ferry, steep wooded hills, and songs, and laughter which echo in the streets, and float across the tide. Or the Alps, keenly cut against the infinite depth of blue, with a whiteness, and a far-off glory, no tongue can utter. Or a solemn cathedral ; or a busy town piled up, with church and castle high aloft, and a still, transparent lake below. But through it all, and underlying it all, is Bellevue Street, with the dirty men and women, who scream and shout at each other, and wrangle in its filthy courts and alleys. Still, God knows that I don't repent, and that I wish my little cousin well'"], [270, "252 ' FOR PERCIVAL. CHAPTER XVII. WANTED, AN ORGANIST. In later days Percival looked back to that Christmas, as his worst and darkest time. His pride had grown morbid, and he swore to himself that he would never give in, that Horace should never know him otherwise than self-sufficient, should never think that but for Mrs. Middleton's or Godfrey Ham mond's charity he might have had his cousin as a pensioner. Brooding on thoughts such as these, he sauntered moodily beneath the lamps, when the New Year was but two days old. His progress was stopped by a little crowd collected on the pavement. There was a concert, and a string of carriages stretched halfway down the street. Just as Percival came up, a girl, in white and amber, with flowers in her hair, flitted hurriedly across the path, and up the steps, and stood glancing"], [271, "WANTED, AN ORGANIST. 253 back, while a fair-headed, faultlessly dressed young man helped her mother to alight. The father came last, sleek, stout, and important. The old people went on in front, and the girl followed with her cavalier, looking up at him, and making some bright little speech, as they vanished into the building. Percival stood and gazed for a moment, then turned round and hurried out of the crowd. The grace and freshness, and happy beauty of the girl, had roused a fierce longing in his heart. He wanted to touch a lady's hand again, to hear the delicate accents of a lady's voice. He remembered how he used to dress him self, as that fair-haired young man was dressed, and escort Aunt Harriet and Sissy to Fordborough entertainments, where the best places were always kept for the Bracken hill party. It was dull enough sometimes, yet how he longed for one such evening now. To hand the cups once again at afternoon tea, to talk just a little with some girl on the old terms of equality \u2014 the longing was not the less real, and even passionate, that it seemed to Thorne itself to be utterly absurd. He mocked at himself as he walked the streets for a couple of hours, and then went back when the concert was just over, and the people coming away. He watched till the"], [272, "' F0R PERCIVAL.' 254 girl appeared. She looked a little tired, he fancied. As she came out into the chill night air, she drew a soft white cloak round her, and went by, quite unconscious of the dark young man, who stood near the door, and fol lowed her with his eyes. The sombre appari tion might have startled her, had she noticed it, though Percival was only gazing at the ghost of his dead life, and having seen it, dis appeared into the shadows once more. ' The night is darkest before the morn.' In Percival's case this was true, for the next day brought a new interest and hope. A letter came from Godfrey Hammond, through which he glanced wearily, till he came to a paragraph about the Lisles. Hammond had seen a good deal of them lately. ' Their father treated you shamefully,' he wrote ; ' but after all it is harder still on his children.' (' Good heavens ! Does he suppose I have a grudge against them ? ' said Percival to him self, and laughed with mingled irritation and amazement.) ' Young Lisle wants a situation as organist somewhere, where he might give lessons and make an income so, but we can't hear of anything suitable. People say the boy is a musical genius, and will do wonders ; but, for my part, I doubt it. He may, how ever, and in that case there will be a line in"], [273, "WANTED, AN ORGANIST. 255 his biography to the effect that I \" was one of the first to discern,\" &c. \u2014 which may be gratifying to me in my second childhood.' Percival laid the letter on the table and looked up with kindling eyes. Only a few minutes' walk from Bellevue Street was St. Sylvester's, a large district church. The building was a distinguished example of cheap ecclesiastical work, with stripes and other pretty patterns in different coloured bricks, and varnished deal fittings, and patent corrugated roofing. All that could be done to stimulate devotion, by means of texts painted in red and blue, had been done, and St. Sylvester's, within and without, was one of those nineteenth-century churches which will doubtless be studied with interest and wonder by the architect of a future age, if they can only contrive to stand up till he comes. The incumbent was High Church, as a matter of course, and musical, more than as a matter of course. Percival looked up from his letter with a sudden remembrance that Mr. Clifton was advertising for an organist ; and, on his way to the office, he stopped to make enquiries at the High Church bookseller's, and to post a line to Hammond. How if this should suit Bertie Lisle ? He tried hard not to think"], [274, "256 ' FOR PERCIVAL. too much about it, but the mere possibility that the bright young fellow, with his day dreams, his unfinished opera, his pleasant voice, and happily thoughtless talk, might come into his life, gave Percival a new interest in it. Bertie had been a favourite of his, years before, when he used to go some times to Mr. Lisle's. He still thought of him as little more than a boy, the boy who used to play to him in the twilight, and he had some trouble to realise that Bertie must be nearly two-and-twenty. If he should come \u2014 but most likely he would not come. It seemed a shame even to wish to shut up the young musician, with his love for all that was beautiful and bright, in that grimy town. Thorne resolved that he would not wish it, but he opened Hammond's next letter with unusual eagerness. Godfrey said they thought it sounded well, especially as when he named Brenthill it appeared that the Lisles had some sort of acquaintance living there, an old friend of their mother's, he believed, which naturally gave them an interest in the place. Bertie had written to Mr. Clifton, who would very shortly be in town, and had made an appointment to meet him. The next news came in a note from Lisle"], [275, "WANTED, AN ORGANIST. 257 himself. On the first page there was a pen and-ink portrait of the incumbent of St. Sylvester's with a nimbus, and it was elaborately dated, ' Festival of St. Hilary.' ' It is all as good as settled,' was his triumphant announcement, 'and we are in luck's way, for Judith thinks she has heard of something for herself too. You will see from my sketch that I have had my inter view with Mr. Clifton. He is quite delighted with me \u2014 a great judge of character, that man ! He is to write to one or two refer ences I gave him ; but they are sure to be all right, for my friends have been so bored with me and my prospects for the last few weeks, that they would swear to my fitness for heaven, if it would only send me there. I rather think, however, that St. Sylvester's will suit me better for a little while. His Reverence is going to look me up some pupils, and I have bought a Churchman's Almanac, and am thinking about starting an oratorio instead of my opera. Wasn't it strange that when your letter came from Brenthill, we should remember that an old friend of my mother's lived there ? Judith and she have been writing to each other ever since.

I shall look you up without fail, and expect you to know everything about lodgings. How about Bellevue Street ? Are you far from St. Sylvester's ? ' Thorne read the letter carefully, and drew from it two conclusions and a perplexity. He concluded that Bertie Lisle's elastic spirits had quickly recovered the shock of his father's failure and flight, and that he had not the faintest idea that any property of his \u2014 Percival's \u2014 had gone down in the wreck. So much the better. His perplexity was \u2014 what was Miss Lisle going to do ? Could the ' we,' who were to arrive, imply that she meant to accompany her brother ? And what was the ' something ' she had heard of for herself ? The words haunted him. Was the ruin so complete that she, too, must face the world, and earn her own living ? A sense of cruel wrong stirred in his inmost soul. He made up his mind at last that she was coming to establish Bertie in his lodgings, before she went on her own way. He offered any help in his power, when he answered the letter; but he added a post-"], [277, "WANTED, AN ORGANIST. 259 script, ' Don't think of Bellevue Street \u2014 you wouldn't like it' He heard no more, till one day he came back to his early dinner, and found a sealed envelope on his table. It contained a half-sheet of paper, on which Bertie had scrawled in pencil, ' Why did you abuse Bellevue Street ? We think it will do. And why didn't you say there were rooms in this very house ? We have taken them, so there is an end of your peaceful solitude. I'm going to practise for ever and ever. If you don't like it, there's no reason why you shouldn't leave \u2014 it's a free country, they say.' Percival looked round his room. She had been there, then ; perhaps had stood where he was standing. His glance fell on the turquoise blue vase, and the artificial flowers, and he coloured as if he were Lydia's accomplice. Had she seen those, and the Langziage of Flowers ? As if his thought had summoned her, Lydia herself appeared, to lay the cloth for his dinner. She looked quickly round. ' Did you see your note, Mr. Thorne ? ' ' Thank you \u2014 yes,' said Percival. ' I suppose it was right to show them in here to write it, wasn't it ? ' she asked, after a pause. ' He said he knew you very well.' ' Quite right, certainly.' s 2"], [278, "' FOR PERCIVAL.' 260 A very pleasant spoken young gentle man, ain't he?' said Miss Bryant, setting down a saltcellar.

Lydia looked at him, but he was gazing into the fire. She went out, came back with a dish, shook her curl out of the way, and tried again. ' I suppose we're to thank you for recom mending the lodgings, ain't we, Mr. Thorne ? I'm sure Ma's much obliged to you. And I'm glad,' this with a bashful glance, ' that you felt you could. It seems as if we'd given satisfaction.' ' Certainly,' said Percival. But you mustn't thank me in this case, Miss Bryant. I really didn't know what sort of lodgings my friend wanted. But of course I'm glad Mr. Lisle is coming here.' ' And ain't you glad Miss Lisle is coming too, Mr. Thorne?' said Lydia, very archly. But she watched him, lynx-eyed. He uttered no word of surprise, but he could not quite control the muscles of his"], [279, "261 WANTED, AN ORGANIST. face, and a momentary light leapt into his eyes. ' I wasn't aware Miss Lisle was coming,' he said. Lydia believed him. ' That's true,' she thought, 'but you're precious glad.' And she added aloud, ' Then the pleasure comes all the more unexpected, don't it ? ' She looked sideways at Percival, and lowered her voice, ' P'raps Miss Lisle meant a little surprise ! ' Percival returned her glance with a grave scorn which she hardly understood. ' My dinner is ready ? ' he said. ' Thank you, Miss Bryant' And Lydia flounced out of the room, half indignant, half sorrowful. He didn't know \u2014 that's true. But she knows what she's after very well \u2014 don't tell me ! ' To Lydia, at that moment, it seemed as if every girl must be seeking what she sought. ' And I call it very bold of her to come poking herself where she isn't wanted \u2014 running after a young man! I'd be ashamed!' A longing to scratch Miss Lisle's face was mixed with a longing to have a good cry, for she was honestly suffering the pangs of unrequited love. It is true that it was not for the first time. The curl, the earrings, the songs, the Language as Flowers, had done duty more than once"], [280, "262 ' FOR PERCIVAL. before. But wounds may be painful without being deep, although the fact of these former healings might prevent all fear of any fatal ending to this later love. Lydia was very unhappy as she went downstairs, though, if another hero could be found ; she was perhaps half-conscious that the melancholy part of her present love-story might be somewhat abridged. The streets seemed changed to Percival as he went back to his work. Their ugliness was as bare and as repulsive as ever, but he understood now that the houses might hold human beings, his brothers and his sisters, since some one roof among them sheltered Judith Lisle. Thus he emerged from the alien swarm amid which he had walked in solitude so many days. Above the dull and miry ways was the beauty of her grey blue eyes, and the glory of her golden hair. He felt as if a white dove had lighted on the town, yet he laughed at his own feelings, for what did he know of her ? He had seen her twice, and her father had swindled him out of his money. Never had his work seemed so tedious ; and never had he hurried so quickly to Bellevue Street, as he did when it was over. The door of No. 13 stood open,"], [281, "263 WANTED, AN ORGANIST. and young Lisle stood on the threshold. There was no mistaking him. His face had changed from the beautiful chorister type of two or three years earlier, but Percival thought him handsomer than ever. He ceased his soft whistling, and held out his hand. ' Thorne ! At last ! I was looking out for you the other way.' Thorne could hardly find time to greet him, before he questioned eagerly, ' You have really taken the rooms here ? ' ' Really and truly. What's wrong ? Anything against the landlady ? ' ' No,' said Percival. ' She's honest enough, and fairly obliging, and all the rest of it. But then your sister is not coming here to live with you as they told me? That was a mistake ? ' ' Not a bit of it. She's coming \u2014 in fact, she's here.' ' In Bellevue Street ? ' Percival looked up and down the dreary thoroughfare. ' But, Lisle, what a place to bring her to ! ' ' Beggars mustn't be choosers,' said Bertie. ' We are not exactly what you would call rolling in riches just now. And Bellevue Street happens to be about midway between St. Sylvester's and Standon Square, so it will suit us both.'"], [282, "264 ' FOR PERCIVAL.' ' Standon Square ? ' Percival repeated. ' Yes. Oh, didn't I tell you ? My mother came to school at Brenthill. It was her old schoolmistress we remembered lived here, when we had your letter. So we wrote to her ; and the old dear not only promised me some pupils, but it is settled that Judith is to go and teach there every day. Judith thinks we ought to stick to one another \u2014 we two.' ' You're a lucky fellow,' said Percival. ' You don't know, and won't know, what loneliness is here.' ' But how do you come to know anything about it ? That's what I can't understand. I thought your grandfather died last sum mer ?' ' So he did.' ' But I thought you were to come in for no end of money ? ' ' I didn't, you see.' ' But surely he always allowed you a lot,' said Lisle, still unsatisfied. ' You never used to talk of doing anything.' ' No, but I found I must. The fact is, I'm not on the best terms with my cousin at Brackenhill, and I made up my mind to be independent. Consequently, I'm a clerk \u2014 a copying clerk, you understand \u2014 in"], [283, "265 WANTED, AN ORGANIST. a lawyer's office here \u2014 Ferguson's in Fisher Street \u2014 and I lodge accordingly.' ' I'm very sorry,' said Bertie. ' Hammond knows all about it,' the other went on, ' but nobody else does.' ' I was afraid there was something wrong,' said Bertie ; ' wrong for you, I mean. From our point of view, it is very lucky that circumstances have sent you here. But I hope your prospects may brighten \u2014 not directly, I can't manage to hope that, but soon.' Percival smiled. ' Meanwhile,' he said, with a quiet earnestness of tone, ' if there is anything I can do to help you or Miss Lisle, you will let me do it ? ' ' Certainly,' said Bertie. ' We are going out to look for a grocer. Suppose you come and show us one.' ' I'm very much at your service. What are you looking at ? ' ' Why \u2014 you'll pardon my mentioning it \u2014 you have got the biggest smut on your left cheek that I've seen since I came here. They attain to a remarkable size in Brent hill, have you noticed ? ' Bertie spoke with eager interest, as if he had become quite a connoisseur in smuts. 'Yes, that's it. I'll look Judith up, and tell her you are going with us.'"], [284, "266 ' FOR PERCIVAL.' Percival fled upstairs, more discomposed by that unlucky black than he would have thought possible. When he had made sure that he was tolerably presentable, he waited by his open door till his fellow-lodgers appeared, and then stepped out on the landing to meet them. Miss Lisle, dressed very simply in black, stood drawing on her glove. A smile dawned on her face when her eyes met Percival's, and, greeting him in her low distinct tones, she held out her white right hand ; still ungloved. He took it with grave reverence, for Judith Lisle had once touched his faint dream of a woman, who should be brave with sweet heroism, tender, and true. They had scarcely exchanged a dozen words in their lives, but he had said to himself, ' If I were an artist, I would paint my ideal with a face like that,' and the memory, with its underlying poetry, sprang to life again, as his glance encountered hers. Percival felt the vague poem, though Bertie was at his elbow, chattering about shops, and though he himself had hardly got over the intolerable remembrance of that smut. When they were in the street, Miss Lisle looked eagerly about her, and asked as"], [285, "267 WANTED, AN ORGANIST. they turned a corner, ' Will this be our way to St. Sylvester's ? ' ' Yes. I suppose Bertie will make his ddbut next Sunday ? I must come and hear him.' ' Of course you must,' said Lisle, ' Where do you generally go ? ' ' Well, for a walk, generally. Sometimes it ends in some outlying church, sometimes not' 'Oh, but it's your duty to attend your parish church when I play there. I suppose St. Sylvester's is your parish church ? ' ' Not a bit of it. St. Andrew's occupies that proud position. I've been there three times, I think.' ' And what sort of a place is that ? ' said Miss Lisle. ' The dreariest, dustiest, emptiest place imaginable,' Percival answered, turning quickly towards her. ' There's an old clergy man, without a tooth in his head, who mumbles something which the congregation seem to take for granted is the service. Perhaps he means it for that. I don't know. He's the curate, I think, come to help the rector who is getting just a little past his work. I don't remember that I ever saw the rector.'"], [286, "' FOR PERCIVAL.' 268 ' But does anyone go ? ' 'Well, there's the clerk,' said Percival thoughtfully ; ' and there's a weekly dole of bread left to fourteen poor men, and fourteen poor women, of the parish. They must be of good character, and above the age of sixty- five. It is given away after the afternoon service. When I have been there, there has always been a congregation of thirty, without reckoning the clergyman.' He paused in his walk. ' Didn't you want a grocer, Miss Lisle ? I don't do much of my shopping, but I believe this place is as good as any.' Judith went in, and the two young men waited outside. In something less than half a minute Lisle showed signs of im patience. He inspected the grocer's stock of goods through the window, and extended his examination to a toy-shop beyond, where he seemed particularly interested in a small and curly lamb, which stood in a pasture of green paint, and possessed an underground squeak or baa. Finally, he returned to Thorne. ' You like waiting, don't you ? ' he said. ' I don't mind it.' 'And I do. That's just the difference. Is there a stationer's handy ?

' I want some music paper ; I can get it before Judith has done ordering in her supplies, if I go at once.' ' Go then ; you can't miss it. I'll wait here for Miss Lisle, and we'll come and meet you, if you are not back.' When Judith came out, she looked round in some surprise. ' What has become of Bertie, Mr. Thorne ? ' ' Gone to the bookseller's,' said Percival ; ' Shall we walk on and meet him ?' They went together down the grey, slushy street. The wayfarers seemed un usually coarse and jostling that evening, Percival thought, the pavement peculiarly miry, the flaring gaslights very cruel to the unloveliness of the scene. ' Mr. Thorne,' Judith began, ' I am glad of this opportunity. We haven't met many times before to-day.' ' Twice,' said Percival. She looked at him, a faint light of surprise in her eyes. ' Ah ! twice,' she repeated. ' But you know Bertie well. You used often to come at one time, when I was away ? ' ' Oh, yes ; I saw a good deal of Bertie,'"], [288, "270 ' FOR PERCIVAL.\" he replied, remembering how he had taken a fancy to the boy. ' And he used to talk to me about you. I don't feel as if we were quite strangers, Mr. Thorne.' ' Indeed, I hope not,' said Percival, elud ing a baker's boy, and reappearing at her side. ' I've another reason for the feeling, too, besides Bertie's talk,' she went on. ' Once, six or seven years ago, I saw your father. He came in one evening about some business, I think, and I still remember the very tone in which he talked of you. I was only a school girl then, but I could not help understanding something of what you were to him.' ' He was too good to me,' said Percival, and his heart was very full. Those bygone days with his father, which had drifted so far into the past, seemed suddenly brought near by Judith's words, and he felt the warmth of the old tenderness once more. ' So I was very glad to find you here,' she said. ' For Bertie's sake, not for yours. I am so grieved that you should have been so unfortunate.' She looked up at him, with eyes which questioned, and wondered, and doubted all at once. But a small girl, staring at the shop windows, drove a perambulator straight at Percival's legs. With a laugh he"], [289, "WANTED, AN ORGANIST. 271 stepped into the roadway to escape the peril, and came back. ' Don't grieve about me, Miss Lisle. It couldn't be helped, and I have no right to complain.' These were his spoken words ; his unspoken thought was that it served him right, for being such a fool as to trust her father. ' It's worse for you, I think, and harder,' he went on ; ' and if you are so brave ' ' It's for Bertie, if I am,' she said quickly ; ' it is very hard on him. We have spoilt him, I'm afraid, and now he will feel it so terribly. For people cannot be the same to us \u2014 how should they, Mr. Thorne ? Some of our friends have been very good ; no one could be kinder than Miss Crawford \u2014 but it is a dreadful change for Bertie. And I have been afraid of what he would do if he went where he had no companions. A sister is so help less. So I was very thankful when your letter came. But I am sorry for you, Mr. Thorne. He told me just now ' ' But, as that can't be helped,' said Per cival, ' be glad for my sake too. I have been very lonely.' She looked up at him, and smiled.

' But they are not good enough for you.' ' Oh yes, they are, and near Standon Square, too ; I shall only have seven or eight minutes' walk to my work. I should not have liked \u2014 Oh, here he is ! Bertie, this is cool of you, deserting me in this fashion ! ' ' Why, of course you were all right with Thorne, and he asked me to let him help me in any way he could. I like to take a man at his word.' ' By all means take me at mine,' said Percival. 'Help you!' said Judith to her brother. ' Am I such a terrible burden, then ?' ' No,' Thorne exclaimed ; ' Bertie is a clever fellow ; he lets me share his privileges first, that I mayn't back out of sharing any troubles later.' ' Are you going to save him trouble by making his pretty speeches for him, too ? ' Judith enquired, with a smile. 'You are indeed a friend in need ! ' They had turned back, and were walking towards Bellevue Street. As they went into No. 13 they encountered Miss Bryant in the passage. She glanced loftily at Miss Lisle as she swept by, but she turned and fixed a"], [291, "WANTED, AN ORGANIST. 273 look of reproachful tenderness on Percival Thorne. He knew that he was guiltless in the matter, and yet in Judith's presence he felt guilty and humiliated beneath Lydia's ostentatiously mournful gaze. The idea that she would probably be jealous of Miss Lisle, flashed into his mind, to his utter disgust and dismay. He turned into his own room, and flung himself into a chair, only to find, a few minutes later, that he was staring blankly at Lydia's blue vase. But for the Lisles, he might almost have been driven from Bellevue Street, by its mere presence on the table. It was beginning to haunt him, it mingled in his dreams, and he had drawn its hideous shape, absently, on the edge of his blotting-paper. Let him be where he might, it lay, a light blue burden, on his mind. It was not the vase only, but he felt that it implied Lydia herself, smile, curl, turquoise earrings and all, and, on the evening of his meeting with Judith Lisle, the thought was doubly hateful. VOL. 11. T"], [292, "' FOR PERCIVAL.' 274 CHAPTER XVIII. LYDIA REARRANGES HER CAP. Thus, as the days lengthened, and the winter, bitter though it was, began to give faint pro mise of sunlight to come, Percival entered on his new life, and felt the gladness of return ing spring. At the beginning of winter our glances are backward ; we are like spend thrifts who have wasted all in days of bygone splendour. We sit, pinched and poverty stricken, by our little light of fire and candle, remembering how the whole land was full of warmth and golden gladness, in our lavish prime. But our feelings change as the days grow clear, and keen, and long. This very year has yet to wear its crown of blossom. Its inheritance is to come, and all is fresh and wonderful. We would not ask the bygone summer for one day more, for we have the beauty of promise, instead of that beauty of long triumph, which is heavy and"], [293, "LYDIA REARRANGES HER CAP. 275 over-ripe ; and with March at hand we can not desire September. Percival's new life was cold and stern as the February weather, but it had its flitting gleams of grace and beauty, in brief words, or passing looks, exchanged with Judith Lisle. He was no lover, to pine for more than fate vouchsafed. It seemed to him that the knowledge that he might see her was almost enough ; and it was well it should be so, for he met her very seldom. She went regularly to Standon Square, and came home late and tired. She had one half-holiday in the week ; but Miss Crawford had recom mended her to a lady, whose eldest girl was dull and backward at her music, and she spent a great part of that afternoon in teaching Janie Barton. Bertie was indignant. ' Why should you, who have an ear and a soul for music, be tortured by such an incapable as that ? Let them find some one else to teach her.' ' And some one else to take the money ! Besides, Mrs. Barton is so kind ' Bertie, who was lying on three chairs in front of the fire, sat up directly, and looked resigned. ' That's it \u2014 now for it. No one is so good as Mrs. Barton, except Miss Craw ford ; and no one is anything like Miss Crawford, except Mrs. Barton. Oh, I know! T 2"], [294, "276 ' FOR PERCIVAL. And old Clifton is the first and best of men. And so you lavish your gratitude on them \u2014 Judith, why are all our benefactors such awful guys ? \u2014 while they ought to be thank ing their stars they've got us ! ' ' Nonsense, Bertie.' ' 'Tisn't nonsense. Aren't you better than I am ? And old Clifton is very lucky to get such an organist. I think he is thankful, but I wish he wouldn't show it by asking me to tea again.' ' Don't complain of Mr. Clifton,' said Judith. ' You are very fortunate, if you only knew it.' ' Am I ? Then suppose you go to tea with him, if you are so fond of him. I rather think I shall have a severe cold coming on next Tuesday.' Judith said no more, being tolerably sure that, when Tuesday came, Bertie would go. But she was not quite happy about him. She lived as if she idolized the spoilt boy, but the blindness which makes idolatry joyful was denied to her. So that, though he was her first thought every day of her life, the thought was an anxious one. She was very grateful to Miss Crawford for having given him a chance, so young and untried as he was, but she could only hope that Bertie"], [295, "LYDIA REARRANGES HER CAP. 277 would not repay her kindness by some thoughtless neglect. At present all had gone well ; there could be no question about his abilities, Miss Crawford was satisfied, and the young master got on capitally with his pupils. Neither was Judith happy when he was with Mr. Clifton. Bertie came home to mimic the clergyman with boyish reckless ness, and she feared that the same kind of thing went on with some of the choir, behind Mr. Clifton's back. (' Behind his back ? ' Bertie said one day. ' Under his nose, if you like ; it would be all one to Clifton.') He frightened her with his carelessness in money matters, and his scarcely concealed contempt for the means by which he lived. ' Thank heaven ! this hasn't got to last for ever,' he said once, when she remonstrated. ' Don't reckon on anything else,' she pleaded. ' I know what you are thinking of \u2014 oh, Bertie I don't like you to count on that ! ' He threw back his head, and laughed. ' Well, if that fails, wait and see what I can do for myself He looked so bright and daring as he spoke, that she could hardly help sharing his confidence. ' Ah ! the opera ! ' she said. ' But, Bertie, you must work.'"], [296, "278 ' FOR PERCIVAL. ' The opera \u2014 yes, of course I will work,' Bertie answered. ' Now you mention it, it strikes me I may as well have a pipe, and think about it a bit. No time like the present, is there ? ' So Bertie had his pipe, and a little quiet meditation. There was a lingering smile on his face as if something had amused him. He always felt particularly virtuous when he smoked his pipe, because it was so much more economical than the cigars of his prosperous days. ' A penny saved is a penny gained.' Bertie felt as if he must be gradually making his fortune, as he leant back, and watched the smoke curl upwards. And yet, with it all, how could Judith complain ? He was the very life of the house, as he ran up and down stairs, filling the dingy passages with melodious singing. He had a bright word for everyone. The grimy little maid-servant would have died for him at a moment's notice. Bertie was always sweet-tempered ; in very truth, there was not a touch of bitterness in his nature. And he was so fond of Judith \u2014 so proud of her, so thoroughly convinced of her goodness, so sure that he should do great things for her some day \u2014 what could she say against him ? Percival, too, was fascinated. His room smelt of Bertie's tobacco, and was littered"], [297, "LYDIA REARRANGES HER CAP. 279 with blotted manuscripts. He went so regularly to hear Bertie play, that Mr. Clifton noticed the olive-skinned, foreign looking young man, and thought of asking him to join the Guild of St. Sylvester, and take a class in the Sunday-school. Yet Percival also had doubts about the young organist's future. He knew that letters came now and then from New York, which saddened Judith, and brightened Bertie. If Mr. Lisle pros pered in America, and summoned his son to share his success, would he have strength to cling to poverty and honour in England ? There were times when Percival doubted it. There were times, too, when he doubted whether the boy's musical promise would ever ripen to worthy fruit, though he was angry with himself for his doubts. ' If he triumphs, it will be her doing,' he thought. Little as he saw of Judith, they were yet be coming friends. You may meet a man every day, and if you only talk to him about the weather and the leading articles in the Times, you may die of old age before you reach friend ship. But these two talked of more than the weather. Once, emboldened by her remem brance of old days, he spoke of his father. He hardly noticed at the time that Judith took keen note of something he said of the"], [298, "* FOR PERCIVAL.' 280 old Squire's utter separation from his son. ' I was more Percival than Thorne till I was twenty,' said he. ' And are you not more Percival than Thorne still ? ' He liked to hear her say ' Percival,' even thus. ' Perhaps,' he said. ' But it is strange how I've learned to care about Brackenhill ; or, rather, it wasn't learning, it came by in stinct ; and now no place on earth seems like home to me, except that old house.' Judith, fair and clear-eyed, leaned against the window, and looked out into the twilight After a pause, she spoke. ' You are fortu nate, Mr. Thorne. You can look back happily to your life with your father.' The intention of her speech was evident ; so was a weariness which he had sometimes suspected in her voice. He answered her, ' And you cannot ? ' ' No,' she said. ' I was wondering just now how many people had reason to hate the name of Lisle.' Percival was not unconscious of the humorous side of such a remark, when addressed to himself. But Judith looked at him, almost as if she would surprise his thought. ' Don't dwell on such things,' he said."], [299, "LYDIA REARRANGES HER CAP. 281 ' Men in your father's position speculate, and perhaps hardly know how deeply they are involved, till nothing but a lucky chance will save them, and it seems impossible to do anything but go on. At last the end comes, and it is very terrible. But you can't mend it ' ' No,' said Judith, ' I can't!' ' Then don't take up a useless burden when you need all your strength. You were not to blame in any way ' ' No,' she said again, ' I hope not. But it is hard to be so helpless. I do not even know their names. I can only feel as if I ought to be more gentle and more patient with everyone, since anyone may be ' ' Ah, Miss Lisle,' said Percival, ' you will pay some of the debts unawares, in some thing better than coin.' She shook her head, but when she looked up at him there was a half smile on her lips. As she moved away, Percival thought of Sissy's old talk about heroic women \u2014 ' Jael, and Judith, and Charlotte Corday.' He felt that this girl would have gone to her death with quiet dignity, had there been need. Godfrey Hammond had called her a plain likeness of her brother, but Percival had seen at the first glance that her face was worth"], [300, "' FOR PERCIVAL.' 282 infinitely more than Bertie's, even in his boyish promise ; and an artist would have turned from the brother to the sister, justifying Percival. It was well for Percival that Judith's friendly smile, and occasional greeting, made bright moments in his life, since he had no more of Lydia's attentions. Poor grimy little Emma waited on him wearily, and always neglected him if the Lisles wanted her. She had apparently laid in an immense stock of goods, for she never went shopping now, but stayed at home, and let his fire out, and was late and slovenly with his meals. There was no great dishonesty, but his tea-caddy was no longer guarded, and provisions ceased to be mysteriously preserved. Miss Bryant seldom met him on the stairs, and when she did, she flounced past him in lofty scorn. Her slighted love had turned to gall. She was bitter in her very desire to convince herself that she had never thought of Mr. Thorne. She neglected to send up his letters ; she would not lift a finger to help in getting his dinner ready ; and if Emma happened to be out of the way, she would let his bell ring, and take no notice. Yet she would have been very true to him, in her own fashion, if he would have had it so ; she would have taken him for better, for worse ; would have slaved"], [301, "283 LYDIA REARRANGES HER CAP. for him, and fought for him, and never suffered anyone else to find fault with him in any way whatever. But he had not chosen that it should be so, and Lydia had reclaimed her heart, and her pocket edition of the Language of Flowers, and now watched Percival and Miss Lisle with spiteful cu riosity. ' I shall be late at Standon Square this evening \u2014 Miss Crawford wants me,' said Judith, one morning to her brother. ' I'll come and meet you,' was his prompt reply. ' Wrhat time ? Don't let that old woman work you into an early grave.' ' There's no fear of that. I'm strong, and it won't hurt me. Suppose you come at half-past nine \u2014 you must have your tea by yourself, I'm afraid.' ' That's all right,' he answered cheerfully. ' That's all right ! What do you mean by that, sir ? ' ' I mean that I don't at all mind when you don't come back to tea. I think I rather prefer it ! There, Miss Lisle ! ' ' You rude boy ! ' She felt herself quite justified in boxing his ears. ' Oh, I say ! Hold hard \u2014 mind my vio lets ! ' he exclaimed. ' Your violets ? Oh, how sweet they are ! '"], [302, "284 ' FOR PERCIVAL.' And bending forward, Judith smelt them daintily. ' Where did you get them, Bertie ? ' ' Ah \u2014 where ? ' And Bertie stood before the glass and surveyed himself. The cheap lodging-house mirror cast a greenish shade over his features, but the little bouquet in his button-hole came out very well. ' Where did I get them ? I didn't buy them, if you mean that. They were given to me.' ' Who gave them to you ? ' ' And then women say it isn't fair to call them curious ! ' Bertie put his head on one side, dropped his eyelids, looked out of the corners of his eyes, and smiled, fingering an imaginary curl. Not that nasty Miss Bryant ! She didn't ! ' She did, though ! ' ' The wretch ! Then you shan't wear them one moment more ! ' Bertie eluded her at tack, and stood, laughing, on the other side of the table. ' Oh, Bertie !

Don't be late for the lessons, and, oh, Bertie, don't be foolish ! ' ' All right,' he answered gaily. Judith ran downstairs. At the door she encountered Lydia, and eyed her with lofty disapproval. It did not seem to trouble Miss Bryant much. She knew Miss Lisle disliked her, and took it as an inevitable fact, if not an indirect com pliment to her conquering charms. So she smiled, and wished Judith good morning. But she had a sweeter smile for Bertie, when a little later, carefully dressed, radiant, hand some, with her violets in his coat, he too went on his way to Standon Square. If Judith had been in Bellevue Street, when he came back, she might have noticed that the little bouquet was gone. Had it drop ped out by accident ? Or had Bertie merely defended his violets for fun, and thrown them away as soon as her back was turned ? Or what had happened tot''hem ? There was no one to inquire.

' Percival assented, and began to move some of the books and papers which were strewn on the table. Lisle sat on the end of the horsehair sofa, and watched him. ' I can't think how you can endure that blue thing, and those awful flowers, con tinually before your eyes,' he said at last. Percival shrugged his shoulders. He could not explain to Lisle that to request that Lydia's love-token might be removed, would have seemed to him to be like going down to her level, and rejecting what he preferred to ignore. ' What am I to do ? ' he said. ' I believe they think it very beautiful, and I fancy the flowers are home-made. People have different ideas of art, but shall I there fore wound Miss Bryant's feelings ? ' ' Heaven forbid!' said Bertie. 'Did Lydia Bryant make those flowers ? How interest ing !

Tell Miss Bryant it was my doing, and I'm afraid it won't mend. Better take up the pieces carefully though, on the chance.' This was thoughtful of Bertie, as the bits were remarkably small. 'And here are the flowers \u2014 all right, I think. Have you got everything?' He held the door open while she went out with her load, and then he came back, rubbing his hands. ' Well, are you grateful ? You'll never see that again.' Percival surveyed him with a grave smile. ' I'm grateful,' he said. ' But I'd rather you didn't treat all the things which offend my eye, in the same way.' Bertie glanced round at the furniture, cheap, mean, and shabby. ' You think I should have too much smashing to do ? ' ' I fear it might end in my sitting cross legged on the floor,' said Thorne. ' And my successor might cavil at Mrs. Bryant's idea of furnished lodgings.' ' Well, I know I've done you a good turn to-day,' Bertie rejoined. ' My conscience"], [307, "289 LYDIA REARRANGES HER CAP. approves of my conduct' And he went off, whistling. Percival, on his way out, met Lydia on the landing. ' Miss Bryant, have you a moment to spare ? ' he said, as she went rust ling past. She stopped, ungraciously. ' The flower-vase on my table is broken. If you can tell me what it cost, I will pay for it' ' Mr. Lisle broke it, didn't he ? Emma said ' ' No matter,' said Thorne. ' It was done in my room. It is no concern of Mr. Lisle's.

Some faint touch of refinement told her that she should not take money, for what she had meant as a love-gift She looked up, and met the utter indifference of his eyes, as he stood, purse in hand, before her. She was ashamed of the remembrance that she had tried to attract his attention, and burned to deny it. ' Well, then, it was three-and-six,' she said. Percival put the money in her hand. She eyed it discontentedly. ' That's right, isn't it ? ' he asked, in some surprise. vol. 11. u"], [308, "' FOR PERCIVAL. 290 The touch of the coins recalled to her the pleasure with which she had spent her own three-and-sixpence, to brighten his room, and she half repented. ' Oh, it's right enough,' she said. ' But I don't know why you should pay for it. Things will get knocked over ' ' I beg your pardon \u2014 of course I ought to pay for it,' he replied, drawing himself up. He spoke the more decidedly that he knew how it was broken. ' But, Miss Bryant, it will not be necessary to replace it. I don't think anything of the kind would be very safe in the middle of my table.' And, with a bow, he went on his way. Lydia stood where he had left her, finger ing his half-crown and shilling, with an uneasy sense that there was something very mean about the transaction. Now that she had taken his money, she disliked him much more, but, as she had taken it, she went away, and bought herself a pair of grass-green gloves. From that time forward she always openly declared that she despised Mr. Thorne. That evening, when they came back from their walk, Lisle asked his companion to lend him a couple of sovereigns. ' You shall have them back to-morrow,' he said, airily. Per cival assented, as a matter of course. He hardly thought about it at all, and, if he had,"], [309, "LYDIA REARRANGES HER CAP. 291 he would have supposed that there was some thing to be paid in Miss Lisle's absence. He had still something left of the small fortune with which he had started. It was very little, but he could manage Bertie's two sovereigns with that, and the money he had laid aside for Mrs. Bryant's weekly bill. Percival Thorne, always exact in his ac counts, supposed that a time was fixed for the repayment of the loan.

CONCERNING SISSY. Percival had announced the fact of the Lisles' presence in Bellevue Street to Sissy, in a carefully careless sentence. Sissy read it, and shivered sadly. Then she answered in a peculiarly bright and cheerful letter. ' I'm not fit for him,' she thought, as she wrote it. ' I don't understand him, and I'm always afraid. Even when he loved me best, I felt as if he loved some dream girl, and took me for her in his dream, and would be angry with me when he woke. Miss Lisle would not be afraid. It is the least I can do for Percival, not to stand in the way of his happiness \u2014 the least I can do \u2014 and oh, how much the hardest ! ' So she gave Thorne to understand that she was getting on remark ably well. It was not altogether false. She had fallen from a dizzy height, but she had found"], [311, "CONCERNING SISSY. 293 something of rest and security in the valley below. And as prisoners, cut off from all the larger interests of their lives, pet the plants and creatures which chance to lighten their captivity, so did Sissy begin to take pleasure in little gaieties, for which she had not cared in old days. She could sleep now at night without apprehension, and she woke refreshed. There was a great blank in her existence, where the thunderbolt fell, but the cloud, which hung so blackly overhead, was gone. The lonely life was sad ; but it held nothing quite so dreadful as the fear that a day might come when Percival and his wife would know that they stood on different levels, that she could not see with his eyes, nor understand his thoughts, when he would look at her with sorrowful patience, and she would die slowly of his terrible kindness. The lonely life was sad, but, after all, Sissy Langton would not be twenty-one till April. Percival read her letter, and asked God frey Hammond how she really was. ' Tell me the truth,' he said ; ' you know all is over between us. She writes cheerfully. Is she better than she was last year ? ' Hammond replied that Sissy was certainly better. ' She has begun to go out again, and Fordborough gossip says that there is some-"], [312, "' F0R PERCIVAL. 294 thing between her and young Hardwicke. He is a good fellow, and I fancy the old man will leave him very well off. But she might do better ; and there are two people, at any rate, who do not think anything will come of it \u2014 myself and young Hardwicke.' Percival hoped not indeed. A month later Hammond wrote that there was no need for Percival to excite himself about Henry Hardwicke. Mrs. Falconer had taken Sissy and Laura to a dance at Latimer's Court, and Sissy's conquests were innumer able. Young Walter Latimer and a Captain Fothergill were the most conspicuous victims. ' I believe Latimer rides into Fordborough every day, and the Captain, being stationed there, is on the spot. Our St. Cecilia looks more charming than ever, but what she thinks of all this, no one knows. Of course Latimer would be the better match, as far as money goes ; he is decidedly better looking, and, I should say, better tempered; but Fothergill has an air about him which makes his rival look countrified, so I suppose they are toler ably even. Neither is overweighted with brains. What do you think ? Young Garnett cannot say a civil word to either of them, and wants to give Sissy a dog. He is not heart whole either, I take it'"], [313, "CONCERNING SISSY. 295 Hammond was trying to probe his corre spondent's heart. He flattered himself that he should learn something from Percival, let him answer how he would. But Percival did not answer at all. The fact was, he did not know what to say. It seemed to him that he would give anything to hear that Sissy was happy, and yet ' Nor did Sissy understand herself very well. Her grace and sweetness attracted Latimer and Fothergill, and a certain gentle indifference piqued them. She was not sad, lest sadness should be a reproach to Percival. In truth, she hardly knew what she wished. One day she came into the room, and over heard the fag-end of a conversation between Mrs. Middleton and a maiden aunt of God frey Hammond's, who had come to spend the day. ' You know,' said the visitor, ' I never could like Mr. Percival Thorne as much as Sissy paused on the threshold, and Miss Hammond stopped short. The colour mount ed to her wintry cheek, and she contrived to find an opportunity to apologise, a little later. ' I beg your pardon, my dear, for my thought less remark just as you came in. I know so little, that my opinion was worthless. I really beg your pardon.'"], [314, "296 ' FOR PERCIVAL. ' What for ? ' said Sissy. ' For what you said about Percival Thorne ? My dear Miss Hammond, people can't be expected to re member that. Why, we agreed that it should be all over, and done with, at least a hundred years ago ! ' She spoke with hurried bravery. The old lady looked at her, and held out her hands. ' My dear, is the time always so long since you parted ? ' Sissy put the proffered hands airily aside, and scoffed at the idea. They had a crowd of callers that afternoon ; but the girl lingered more than once by Miss Hammond's side, and paid her delicate little attentions. This perplexed young Garnett very much, when he had ascertained, from one of the company, that the old woman had nothing but an annuity of three hundred a year. He hoped that Sissy Langton wasn't a little queer, but, upon his word, it looked like it."], [315, "297 CHAPTER XX. SHORT RECKONINGS MAKE LONG FRIENDS. It was the ist of March, and a wild wind was hurrying shreds of white cloud across the blue. Percival had taken his breakfast in snatches, performing on his bell mean while. Emma had not brought his boots, and would not so much as come to be told that he wanted them. At last, despairing, he went out on the landing and shouted his request to her, as she shuffled on some errand below. Turning to go back, he met Miss Lisle, who had just come down the stairs behind him. They stood for a moment exchanging trivial remarks. To them came a stout, fresh-coloured, peculiarly innocent-looking old man, who went by with a beaming smile, and a slight bow. 'That's Mr. Fordham,' said Judith; 'I don't think I ever saw him so close before.'"], [316, "298 ' FOR PERCIVAL. ' No ; one hardly meets him from one week's end to another. He is unusually late this morning.' ' He looks a very quiet, steady \u2014 really one might take him for rather a nice old man.' Percival stared blankly at her, and then began to laugh. ' Well, Miss Lisle, I never heard a reputation blighted so completely by a complimentary sentence before.' Judith blushed a little. ' But he isn't very nice, is he ? ' ' I don't know about nice. I should say he was as steady and harmless an old fellow as ever lived. What do you mean ? ' ' Well \u2014 ' Judith hesitated. ' Of course one has no business to judge any one with out really knowing. But his staying out so late at night \u2014 \u2014 ' ' So late at night ! ' Percival repeated. ' I suppose he has a latch-key generally. But one or two nights I am sure Miss Bryant sat up to let him in. I heard them whisper ing, at least I heard her. I don't think that girl could even whisper quietly.' ' But there must be some mistake. Ford ham comes in quite early, and very often he doesn't go out at all in the evening.' ' He goes out later,' said Judith."], [317, "SHORT RECKONINGS MAKE LONG FRIENDS. 299 ' Indeed, no. I could time all his move ments. His room is next mine, and the wall is not so thick as I could wish. He snores sometimes.' ' But,' she persisted, looking scared and white \u2014 yet what was Fordham to her ? \u2014 4 But I have heard him over and over again, Mr. Thorne, I can't be mistaken.' Percival was disconcerted, too. He looked at the carpet, at his slippered feet, at anything but her face. ' You have heard some one, I suppose ; I don't know who comes in late. Not poor old Fordham.' He heard Emma on the stairs, and hurried to meet her. Coming back, with his boots in his hand, he found Judith standing exactly as he had left her. ' I'm sure I beg Mr. Fordham's pardon,' she said with a smile. ' One does make curious mistakes, certainly. That nice-look ing old man ! ' And nodding farewell to young Thorne, she went away. He did not see her again for two days, though he watched anxiously for her. Bertie came in and out, and was much as usual. On the third evening, as Percival was going up stairs, she called after him, ' Mr. Thorne.' He turned eagerly. ' You lent Bertie some money a day or two since ? '"], [318, "' FOR PERCIVAL. 300 Something in her voice or her look made Percival sure that Lisle had borrowed and spent it without her knowledge, and that it was a trouble to her. After all, what did it matter ? He would sell his watch, and pay Mrs. Bryant. He could not deny Bertie's debt, since she had found it out, but he could make light of it. So he nodded. ' Yes, by the way, I be lieve I did. He hadn't his purse or some thing' This in a tone of airy indifference. ' Tell me how much it was, please, and I'll pay it back.' Then he saw that her purse was open in her hand. ' Oh, it doesn't matter,' he said ; ' don't pay me off in such a quick, business-like way, Miss Lisle. I'm not the milkman, nor yet the washing. Bertie will settle with me one of these days.' ' Please tell me, Mr. Thorne. I mean to pay it. I must' ' Well, I'll ask him about it then.' ' You know,' with a look of reproach and pleading. Percival could not deceive her, she looked so sorrowfully resolute. He met the glance of her grey eyes. ' Two pounds,' he said, and was certain that she was relieved at the answer."], [319, "SHORT RECKONINGS MAKE LONG FRIENDS. 301 ' Bertie wasn't sure it wasn't two pounds ten.' ' On my honour, no. He asked me for a couple of sovereigns, and I took it literally.' ' If you say so, I am sure. I didn't doubt you. I only told you that you might under stand why I asked.' She put the money, a sovereign and two halves, into his unwilling hand. Then he understood her relief, for, looking down into the little sealskin purse, he saw that there was no more gold in it. The last ten shillings must have been counted out in silver, and he was not quite sure it would not have ended in a threepenny piece, and some halfpence. ' Now I am going to ask a favour,' she said. ' Don't lend Bertie any more, please. He has been used to spend just what he liked, and he doesn't think, poor boy. And it is only wasted. Don't let him have any more.' ' But, Miss Lisle,' said Percival, ' if your brother asks me, do you mean that I am to say \" No \" ? ' ' Please \u2014 if you would. He mustn't be extravagant, we can't afford it. He can't pay you back, and if I lost any of my work \u2014 Mrs. Barton's lessons, for instance \u2014 I couldn't either.'"], [320, "' FOR PERCIVAL. 302 ' Yotc work to pay me !

It's between Bertie and myself, and I shouldn't be ruined if he didn't pay me till his ship comes home one of these days. Take it back, please, and he and I will arrange it.' She shook her head. 'No! my brother's debts are mine.' 'Ah ! ' said Percival, with a swift, eloquent glance. ' Then let me be your creditor a little longer ; I hardly know what it feels like, yet' ' Since when has your ship come home, Mr. Thorne, that you can afford to be so generous ?' The blood mounted to his forehead at her question, but he answered quickly : ' My ship has not come home. Perhaps if it had, I should not dare to ask you to let me help you. I feel as if our poverty made us all nearer together.' ' It is not everyone who would say so in your place,' Judith replied. ' I am your debtor, for those words. But we Lisles have wronged you too much already ; you shouldn't try to make the load heavier.' ' Wronged me ? ' he faltered. ' Did you think I did not know ?

If you lend him any more, you may try to hide it from me, but I shall find it out, and I will pay it, every farthing. I will find some way, if I have to sit up every night for a week, and work my fingers to the bone ! ' 'God forbid!' said Percival. 'He shall have no more from me. But be generous, and promise me, that if you should want help, such as my poverty can give, you will forget old times, and come to me.' 'No, I won't promise that. I will re member them, and come ! ' She caught his hand, pressed it one moment in her own, flung it from her, and escaped. ' Judith ! ' he called after her, but she was gone. Percival went into his own room. The money had come just in time, for his land lady's weekly account was lying on the table. He looked at the three coins with lingering tenderness, and, after a moment's hesitation, he took one of them, and vowed that he would never part with it. Yet, in the midst of his ardent resolution, he smiled rather bitterly to think that it was not the sovereign,"], [322, "' FOR PERCIVAL. 304 but one of the halves, he meant to keep for ever. Poverty had taught him many lessons, and among them, how to combine economy and sentiment. ' If she had given me the ten shillings' worth of silver, I suppose I should have saved the threepenny bit!' he said to himself, as he locked his little remem brance in his desk. A couple of days later, as he was walking home with Bertie, they passed three or four men who were sauntering idly along ; and Thorne felt sure that his companion received, and returned, a silent glance of recognition. He glanced over his shoulder at them, and disliked their look exceedingly. ' Do you know who those fellows were we passed just now ? ' he said. Bertie looked back. ' One is the brother of a man in our choir.' ' Hm ! I wouldn't have one of them for my brother at any price,' said Percival. The matter dropped, but he could not forget it. He fancied that there was a slight change in Bertie himself, that the boy's face was keener and haggard, and that there was an anxious expression in his eyes. But he owned frankly that he was not at all sure that he should have noticed anything if his suspicions had not been previously aroused."], [323, "SHORT RECKONINGS MAKE LONG FRIENDS. 305 ' Come in this evening,' said Bertie, when they went upstairs. He leant against the door of Percival's room, and as his friend hesitated, he called to his sister : ' Here, Judith ! tell Thorne to come and have some tea with us ; they've let his fire out, and his room is as warm and cheerful as a sepulchre.' ' Do you think I order other people about as I do you ? ' she replied. ' Will you come, Mr. Thorne ? I can at any rate promise you a fire and a welcome.' When she met him she was quite calm, tranquil, and clear-eyed. Do the ripples of the summer sea recall that distant line, the supreme effort of wind and tide some stormy night ? Percival would have thought that it had been all a dream, but for the little coin which that wave had flung at his feet for a remembrance. And he had called after her ' Judith ! ' The tide had ebbed, and he did not even th u. of her as other than Miss Lisle. Had . heard him that evening ? He would almost have hoped not, but that twilight moment seemed so far away that it must be absurd to link it with his everyday life. Apparently she and Bertie were on their usual footing. Did the young fellow know of that absurd mistake about old Fordham ? Did Percival really detect a shade of dim vol. 11. x"], [324, "' FOR PERCIVAL.' 306 apprehension on Judith Lisle's face, as if she had an unspoken fear ? As Bertie leant forward, and the lamplight shone on his clearly-cut features, Percival was more than ever certain of the change in him. Could his sister fail to see it ? ' Bertie,' she said, when they had finished their tea, and were standing round the fire ; ' Bertie, I'm afraid you've lost one of your pupils.' He had his elbow on the chimney-piece, his hand hung loosely open, and his eyes were fixed upon the leaping flames. When Judith spoke, he looked up inquiringly. ' Miss Nash \u2014 Emmeline Nash,' said Judith. Percival happened to be looking at the fire, too, and he suddenly saw Bertie's fingers drawn quickly up. But the young master spoke very composedly indeed : ' Emmeline Nash \u2014 why ? Has anything happened ? ' ' No ! only Mr. Nash has given in at last, and says she may go home at Easter for good. She is older than any of the other pupils, Mr. Thorne ; in fact, she is not treated as a pupil. But her father is ' ' An old fossil ! ' said Bertie. ' Well \u2014 interested in fossils, and that sort of thing, and a widower ; so there has not"], [325, "SHORT RECKONINGS MAKE LONG FRIENDS. 307 been much of a home for her, and he always fancied she was better at school. But school can't last for ever ' ' Happiest time of one's life ! ' Bertie ejaculated. 'Oh! do you think so?' said Judith, doubtfully. ' Not at all ! But I believe it is the right thing to say.' ' Stupid boy ! And as she will very soon be twenty, I really think she ought not to be kept there any longer.' ' Of course Miss Nash is delighted,' said Percival. ' Yes, but hardly as much so as I expected. One's castles in the air don't look quite the same when one is close to them. I am afraid her home life won't be very bright' ' Perhaps she will make it brighter,' said Thorne. ' What is she like ? Is she pretty ? ' ' Yes,' said Bertie. Judith smiled. ' One has to qualify all one's adjectives for her. She is nice-ish, pretty-ish ; I doubt if she is as much as clever-ish.' ' No need for her to be any more,' Bertie remarked. ' Didn't Miss Crawford say she would come in for a lot of money, some of her mother's, when she was one-and-twenty ? ' x 2"], [326, "308 ' FOR PERCIVAL. ' Yes \u2014 five or six hundred a year.' ' That's why he has kept her at school, I suppose. Afraid she should take up with a curate, very likely.' ' Mr. Nash is very rich too, and she is an only child,' said Judith, ignoring Bertie's remark. ' But I think it has been hard on Emmeline.' ' Well, I'm sorry she is going,' said Lisle, ' very sorry.' ' Is she such a promising pupil ? ' Thorne inquired. ' She's a nice girl,' said Bertie, but a promising pupil \u2014 O Lord !

After a little more of this treatment, the unfortunate melody grew very lame indeed, and finally died of exhaus tion. ' That's Miss Emmeline Nash ! ' said Bertie, spinning round on the music-stool, and confronting Percival. ' It is very like Emmeline's style of play ing,' Judith owned. ' Of course it is. Let's have some thing else for a change.' And turning back to the piano, he began to sing. Then he"], [327, "SHORT RECKONINGS MAKE LONG FRIENDS. 309 called Judith to come and take her turn. She sang well, and Percival, by the fireside, noted the young fellow's evident pride in her per formance, and admired the pair. (Anyone else might have admired the three, for Thome's grave, foreign-looking face was just the fitting contrast to the Lisles' fair, clear features. The morbid depression of a couple of months earlier had passed, and left him far more like the Percival of Brackenhill. Poverty surrounded the friends and dulled their lives, but as yet it was only a burden, not a blight.) ' You sing,' said Bertie, looking'back. ' I remember you were great at some of those old songs. I'll play for you \u2014 what shall it be?' ' I'm sure I hardly know,' said Percival, coming forward. ' Let's have \" Shall I, wasting in des pair ? \" ' Lisle suggested. ' It has been going in my head all this morning.' He played a few notes. ' No, no ! ' the other exclaimed hurriedly. ' Not that.'

He woke up sud denly \u2014 young Lisle was speaking, and Judith was saying, ' Let Mr. Thorne choose.' ' Oh, I don't mind,' said Percival. ' Shall it be \" Drink to me only with thine eyes \" ?

The last word had scarcely left his lips, when the door opened, and Emma showed in Mr. Clifton, of St. Sylvester's. The clergyman came forward, black coated, smooth- shaven, with watchful glances, which seemed ever looking out for that lay co-operation we hear so much of now. Lisle looked over his shoulder, and sprang up to receive him. The visitor tried to get his umbrella and two or three books into the hand which already held his hat, and one little volume fell to the floor. Percival picked it up and smoothed the pages. ' Mr. Thorne \u2014 Mr. Clifton,' said the young organist, as the book was restored to its owner. Percival"], [329, "Drink to me only with thlxe eyes"], [330, ""], [331, "SHORT RECKONINGS MAKE LONG FRIENDS. 311 bowed gravely, and Mr. Clifton did not shake hands, as he would have done if the young man's manner had been less reserved. He was lavish of such greetings. A clergyman might shake hands with any one. ' I'll not detain you long, Lisle,' he said. ' But I wanted to speak to you about the choir practice to-morrow.' And there ensued a little business talk between parson and organist. Judith took up a bit of work, and Percival leant against the chimney-piece. Presently Lisle went back to the piano, and tried over a hymn tune which Mr. Clifton had brought. The clergyman stood solemnly by. ' I met Gordon a few minutes ago,' he said. ' He was with his brother, and some other men of the same stamp. If he mixes himself up with that set, he must go.' ' You'll miss him in the choir, Mr. Clifton,' said Bertie. ' He must choose between such associates and the choir,' the other replied. The words were moderate enough, but the tone was austere. ' Especially at Easter,' said Bertie, still playing. ' What of that ? ' demanded the other. * I would rather have no choir at St. Sylvester's than have men in it whose way of life during"], [332, "' FOR PERCIVAL. 312 the week made a mockery of the praises they sang on Sundays.' He spoke in a low voice, and Bertie's playing partially covered the conversation. ' Perhaps, Mr. Clifton, if Gordon understood how much you disapproved ' \u2014 the young organist began. ' Gordon \u2014 Gordon \u2014 it isn't only Gordon who should understand. Every one should understand my feeling on such a subject, without my having to explain it. But I won't keep you any longer now ; it is getting late. Remember, seven o'clock to-morrow evening.' And with a polite remark or two to the others, Mr. Clifton bowed himself out, with Bertie in attendance. The procession of two might have been more dignified, if the organist had not made a face at Judith and Percival as he went out at the door, and if he had not danced a fantastic but noiseless dance on the landing, behind the incumbent of St. Sylvester's, who was feeling feebly, in the dim light, for the top step of Mrs Bryant's staircase. ' Is anything the matter with Mr. Clifton ?' Judith asked, when the boy came back and executed another war-dance all round the room. ' He didn't seem pleased, I thought' Bertie brought himself up with a grand"], [333, "SHORT RECKONINGS MAKE LONG FRIENDS. 313 flourish opposite the arm-chair, and sank into it. ' Bless you, no, there's nothing the matter with him. Tumbled out of bed the wrong side this morning \u2014 that's all. He does, some times.' ' Might have got over that by this time of night, one would think,' said Percival, looking at his watch. ' Hold hard \u2014 you aren't going yet,' ex claimed Bertie, bounding up. ' Here, Judith, let's have another song to take the taste of old Clifton out of our mouths. Whatever possessed him to come here to-night ? ' They had two or three songs instead of one, and then Percival went off. Judith put her work away, shut up the piano, and laid Bertie's music straight. He stood mean while with his back to the dying fire, idly chinking some money which he had taken from his waistcoat pocket, a half-crown and two or three shillings. His brows were drawn down as if he were lost in thought. Pre sently his half-crown went spinning in the air, he caught it dexterously \u2014 heads. Bertie half smiled to himself, as who should say, 'Well, if Destiny will have it so, what am I, that I should resist it ?

Should the verdict be adverse, it is no worse than it was before, for, if you have really made up your mind, so trivial an accident will not stop you. It may even be your duty to show that you attach no super stitious importance to it. And, on the other hand, if chance favours you, some of your burden of responsibility is transferred to the shoulders of fate. So Bertie smiled, pocketed his half-crown, kissed his sister, and went off to his own room, whistling on his way thither with peculiar distinctness and perseverance. Nearly an hour later, two figures stood by the dim light in the passage, and con versed in whispers. ' Now, my charming Lydia, how about that key ? ' ' I'll charming Lydia you,' was the reply. ' I like your impudence ! ' ' I know you do. You shall have some more when I've time to spare. But now I must really be off. Get me the key, there's a dear girl.' ' I can't, then.

' Well, what then ? If I were a man, I wouldn't be afraid of my sister! I'd be my own master ' ' So will I,' said Bertie Lisle. ' And I'd say what I meant, right out. I would ! ' ' If you knew there'd be a fuss, and people anxious about you ? Would you?' He yawned. ' No \u2014 I'll be my own master, but I like to do things quietly.' ' I don't care so much about that,' said Lydia, whose feelings were less delicate. To struggle openly for an avowed object seemed to her the most natural thing in the world, and she would have preferred her indepen dence to be conspicuous. She did not under stand that with men of Bertie's stamp it is not the latch-key itself, but the unsuspected latch-key, which confers the liberty they love. ' Well ? ' said he. ' Am I to stay here all night ? ' ' That's just what you'd better do. You won't get any good out of that lot, and so I tell you.

How am I to get a key from under her very nose ? ' Lisle seemed to reflect. ' Old Fordham dosen't have one, I suppose ? ' ' Gracious, no \u2014 not he ! If you gave him one, he'd drop it as if it was red-hot. He thinks they're wicked.' There was a pause, but, after a few mo ments, there stole through the silence a sweetly insinuating voice, ' Then, Lydia '"], [337, "SHORT RECKONINGS MAKE LONG FRIENDS. 317 Lydia half turned away, and put up her left shoulder. ' Then, Lydia, I suppose you wouldn't ' ' You'd better keep on supposing I wouldn't.' ' Can't suppose such cruelty for more than a moment. Can't really.

' ' Why I must try another plan to get free. I shan't like it, but I must. But there'll be a row, and I shall have to go away. I'd a good deal rather not.' ' What sort of plan ? ' she asked curiously. ' Desperate ! ' he answered, and shook his head. ' What is it ? ' Her eyes were widely opened in excitement and alarm. ' You ain't going to be driven to forge something, like people in novels ? Or \u2014 or \u2014 it isn't a big robbery, is it ? Oh you wouldn't ! '"], [338, "318 ' FOR PERCIVAL.' The face opposite looked so smiling, and candid, and innocent, that it made the words she had hazarded an obvious absurdity, even to herself, as soon as she had uttered them. ' Why not a murder ? ' said Lisle. ' I think it shall be a murder. Upon my word, you're complimentary ! No, no, I don't mean to try my hand at any of them.' She smiled, relieved. ' But I must go out to-night. Lydia, will you let me in once more ? ' ' Once more ? You won't ask again ? ' ' Never again.' There was a pause. ' Didn't you say that last time ? ' Lydia, you are the unkindest girl ! ' ' Well then, I will.' ' No, you are the kindest' ' Just this once more. Mind you tap very gently, and I'll be awake. But do be careful. It frightens me so.' When the house was full of lodgers, the Bryants stowed themselves away in any odd corners. At this time Lydia occupied a large cupboard \u2014 by courtesy called a small room \u2014 close to their stuffy little back parlour. Lisle would go to the yard behind the house, which was common to two or three besides No. 13, and with one foot on a projecting bit"], [339, "SHORT RECKONINGS MAKE LONG FRIENDS. 319 of brickwork could get his hand on the sill, and make his signal. ' Some day the police '11 take you for a burglar,' said Lydia, encouragingly. ' Well, go and enjoy yourself.' ' It is a shame to keep you up so long, isn't it ? What do you do all the time, eh, Lydia ? ' ' Sit in the dark, mostly, and think what a fool I'm making of myself ' Don't do that. Think how good you are to a poor fellow in trouble. That will be better \u2014 won't it ? But I must be off \u2014 good by, you kind Lydia.' He stooped forward and kissed her, taking her hand in his. He found it convenient to pay his debt in this coin, his creditor being passably pretty. Not that Bertie had any taste for indiscriminate kissing. Had he had five thousand a year, and had Lydia rendered him a service, he would have recompensed her with some of his superfluous gold. But as he only had his salary as organist, and what he could make by giving music lessons, he paid her with kisses instead. He had no particular objection ; and was it not his duty to be economical, for Judith's sake as well as his own ? ' Go along with you ! ' said Lydia, and the young man, who had achieved his purpose,"], [340, "'FOR PERCIVAL. 320 and had no reason for prolonging the inter view, stole laughingly downstairs, waving a farewell as he vanished round the corner. Lydia stood as if she were rooted to the ground, listening intently. She heard the door opened, very gently, and closed with infinite precautions. She still stood till she had counted a hundred under her breath, and then, judging that Mrs. Bryant had not been disturbed by his stealthy exit, she went down to fasten it. She was prepared with an answer if she should be caught in the act ; but she was glad to get away undetected, for an excuse, which is perfectly satisfactory at the time, may be very unsatisfactory indeed when viewed by the light of later events. So Lydia rejoiced when she found herself safe in her own room, though she pursued her usual train of meditation in that refuge. She ap praised Lisle's gratitude and kisses pretty accurately, and was angry with herself that she should care to have them, knowing that they were worthless. Yet, as she sat there, she said his name to herself, ' Bertie,' as she had heard his sister call him.

' Oh you are,' said the girl, ' and there's no denying it' She shook her head, and her vis-a-vis shook its head in the dim dusk, as much as to say, ' No more a fool than you are yourself, Lydia.' ' Nobody could be,' said Lydia moodily. She did not deem it prudent to keep her light burning very late, and she had a long vigil before the signal came, the three soft taps at her window. She was prepared for it. Every sound had grown painfully distinct to her anxious ears, and she had .been almost certain that she knew Lisle's hurried yet stealthy step, as he turned into the yard.
