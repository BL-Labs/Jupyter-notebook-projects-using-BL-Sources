CHAPTER I. \" Till each man find his own in all men's good, And all men work in noble brotherhood, Breaking their mailed fleets and armed towers, And ruling by obeying Nature's powers ! \" Tennyson. At about half-past ten o'clock \u2014 a late hour for him \u2014 -'on the morning folloAving his re ception there, Van Helder presented him self at the house of the Duke de Roche si erre, in the hope of learning when he could see that nobleman, but for that day at least he was destined to be disap pointed. It was an anniversary, on which the Duke received no one, said the servant, in answer to the application ; but his Grace had left a note for Van Helder, which the VOL. II. B"], [8, "2 VERONIA. latter found to contain a few words of polite regret, and the expressed hope of seeing the Doctor to breakfast on the succeeding morning. It was one of the last days of October : bright, clear, and invigorating was the air, and brilliant the sunshine, so that, before returning to breakfast, Van Helder felt tempted to prolong his walk, and entered for that purpose the sparkling precincts of the Luxembourg Gardens. As he reached a centre walk, and was. proceeding at his usual brisk but dislocated pace along it, an advancing figure attracted his at tention. It was that of a slight, pale, plainly-dressed individual, on approaching Avhom the Doctor recognized the magic loving Marquis whom he had met on the previous evening. A very polite and in stantaneous recognition by the latter showed Van Helder that his conduct had failed to leave any lasting irritation upon the noble man's mind, as was in truth the case ; for although annoyed, as he had not unnaturally been, a feAv words exchanged with the Duke before retiring, joined to Van Hel-"], [9, "VERONIA. 3 der's complacent attention to his story, had sufficed to dispel the feeling, and to awaken in its place some interest, and not a little curiosity, respecting the eccentric Doctor. As the dread of ridicule is known by all the Avorld to be the Frenchman's sovereign foible, a feAv words of explanation here become necessary to show in Avhat particu lars the Marquis de St. Gregoire differed on this point from his countrymen. To be the object of derision is, as we all admit, pleasant to no man, but from even the most distant approach to it the Gaul shrinks, as from the keenest moral pain. All classes are more or less the victims of this terror, but undoubtedly in the \" Bour geoisie \" it is the most intensely felt. To listen to the women of this class, as they descant upon the most trifling infringement of the code of etiquette, tending to bring observation upon the infringer, one would suppose that there existed in the universe no law of which the infraction could be half so terrible in its consequences. The very cut and colour of a garment, each step and gesture, are regulated by like b 2"], [10, "4 VERONIA. arbitrary decrees. What are the sacrifices entailed by their observance, compared to the horror of being stigmatised as eccentric, and \u2014 dreadful climax of all torture \u2014 laughed at ! Rather than that, give to the Frenchman, or woman, death, and it is hardly too much to say that it will be greeted as a favour ! It was not to be supposed that the Mar quis was an absolute exception to this rule, but the pride of birth, the consciousness of intellectual superiority, and a certain dignity of character, independent of either, had raised him above the miserable excess of such a weakness. He was, and felt him self to be a gentleman, in every sense of the word, and as such, proud enough to take his own ground \u2014 if not forgetful, at least regardless, that a vulgar world looked on. On understanding the character with which he had been brought into contact in the person of Van Helder, aU anger at the unprovoked attack that had been made upon him died away. As a mere humorist, the Doctor would have seemed to him un pardonable ; but as the shrewd, self-formed"], [11, "5 VERONIA. philosopher and man of science, there might be much worth cultivating in him, and under this impression, Monsieur de St. Gregoire resolved to dive beloAv the rough surface presented to his vieAv. Instinctively gifted by nature, as Ave have said, and having already had his powers of observation aAvakened respecting the Marquis, Van Helder felt, on receiving that nobleman's salutation, aU that was passing in his mind, and, touched by it, became sorry, and anxious to atone for his late rudeness. Yielding instantly to the im pulse, he said, eagerly : \u2014 \" I am very fortunate to have met you, Monsieur le Marquis, that I may ask your pardon for my ill-behaviour of last night. It was very unjustifiable of me to act so, I confess, but I hope you will be good enough to forgive and forget it ; \" and while thus speaking, the Doctor became himself forget ful of his severe judgment on the previous evening, and looked, as he felt, subdued and contrite. \" Say no more, monsieur, I beg,\" replied St. Gregoire, with dignified courtesy, and"], [12, "6 VERONIA. as near an approach to a smile on his pale face as its serious cast of feature admitted of. \" You were quite at liberty to level a jest at Democritus, or any other ancient, if it pleased you ; and although we are now aware how much on this one subject our views differ, I see no reason Avhy we may not come to a good understanding on others equally interesting to us both.\" \"Thanks, monsieur,\" said Van Helder, not ungrateful for this delicate forbearance ; \" but, although, as you say, our views are so opposed upon these points, that is no rea son \u2014 with your kind permission \u2014 for ex cluding them from our future conversation. I do not, it is true, put the slightest confi dence in the reality of either spiritualism or clairvoyance, but then, I frankly con fess, that if you, on the one hand, cannot prove them to be true, I, on the other, am equally incapable of demonstrating them to be false.\" \" Do these things interest you, mon sieur ? \" asked the Marquis, suddenly, after a moment's silence ; \" because if not, it will happen, as in the case of a still higher faith,"], [13, "VERONIA, 7 that you will grow no wiser by their inves tigation. He who brings to the examina tion of the objects of either faith or science a cold heart and an indifferent mind, will never lift a corner of the veil which hides their mysteries from careless eyes.\" \" Exactly so,\" replied Van Helder, with his usual bluntness ; \" and that is why, per\" haps, I never could become a devotee in either the spiritual or religious sense. There are, I think, so many more important problems relating to the Avorld we live in, that, until these are solved, it seems to me unphilosophic, to say the least, to go star gazing elsewhere \u2014 but I may be wrong, you know \u2014 I may be wrong.\" \"And may I ask Avithout indiscretion, mon sieur, what are the other problems to which you aUude ? \" inquired the Frenchman, with an expressive elevation of the eye broAvs, and a penetrating side-glance to wards his companion, which was, however, totaUy unnoticed by the latter. \" Some that may seem to other men as little Avorth the trouble of speculating on as these appear to me,\" ansAvered Van Helder,"], [14, "8 VERONIA. frankly; \"but itis cold work standing here \u2014 if you are going my way, Monsieur le Mar quis, let us move on.\" \"With pleasure,\" replied St. Gregoire, graciously, \"my way is yours ; but if you have no objection, we might pursue our conversation more agreeably in one of yon der walks, where there are fewer curious ears. One never knows noAV who may not take note of every word,\" added he, in an under tone, and casting a furtive glance around. \" Indeed ! pleasant that ! \" remarked Van Helder, dryly ; \" but lead the way, Marquis, and I will follow.\" The Frenchman did so, and in another moment they stood at the entrance of a side walk, as lonely and deserted as the one which they had just left had been ani mated. \" You were about to observe, monsieur, that there were other problems which you considered better worth study than those of which I spoke,\" commenced St. Gregoire ; \"and I confess that it Avould give me pleasure to hear what they may be, holding, as I do, the opinion that first of all in the scale of"], [15, "9 VERONIA. interest come those things AA7hich tend to unravel the mysteries of our spiritual being, and furnish evidence, however slight, of its connection with a higher sphere.\" \"Exactly the point on which I have the misfortune of differing from you, Monsieur le Marquis,\" said the Doctor, who, at the moment of mounting his hobby, could al- Avays afford to be polite; \" and that for two reasons : first, that those mysteries are, I conceive, of a nature far too subtle to come within the scope of the very best human reasoning powers ; and, secondly, that, even if they did so, man's more evi dent interests and necessities on earth are so far independent of them as to render their investigation, as a first object, almost as foolish as the act of the dog letting fall the real piece of meat to snatch at its shadoAv in the water. The story, perhaps, recurs to you ? \" The Marquis was a moment silent. Not even the characteristic quaintness of the illustration eUcited a smile from him. A materialist was, of all characters, the most obnoxious to him, and Van Helder's speech"], [16, "10 VERONIA. seemed to indicate something very like it. Reflection, however, stayed the utterance of this suspicion, and inclined him to suspend his judgment until he should have heard more. \" If, then, I understand you rightly, monsieur,\" said he, after a brief pause, during Avhich the Doctor's quaint figure, as they Avalked onwards, SAvayed complacently at his companion's side, \"you would appear almost to place the gratification of man's animal instincts above that of his moral faculties, and can scarcely be aware how pernicious in its consequences such a doctrine must be.\" \"Not quite fairly stated, Monsieur le Marquis, for in truth it was not strictly speaking a question Avith me of either moral faculties or animal instincts ; what I meant exactly to say was this, \u2014 that, as a material being, inhabiting a material world, it less concerns man to speculate on what may be going on in other regions with which his own organization bears so remote an affinity, if any, that it is next to impossible to the eye of science to trace it, than to turn his attention to the pressing and closer question"], [17, "VERONIA. 11 of how to increase his Avell-being, and diminish his miseries in this his present sphere of action.\" \" You wiU pardon me for observing, monsieur, that these are scarcely the senti ments of a Christian,\" observed St. Gregoire, more gravely than before. \" Monsieur le Marquis is correct ; I am not one,\" was the unqualified reply. \" Alas ! is it possible ?\" ejaculated the Usten er in dismay. \" Forgive me, but I must say how terrible I think it, that reli gion should be decreasing, as is the case in our day. I come of a race who have ever been devoted servants of their Church and \" \u2014 with another rapid glance around him \u2014 \" of their King. Sad, doubly sad, is it to hear, as in these days Ave too often do, open denials of the faith like this. Pardon me, monsieur, but with a mind shrewd, frank, nay, open to conviction, as I am sure, with out flattery, yours is, what can have induced you to turn aside from the only philosophic, because the only true solution of the other wise dark problem of man's destiny and place in the creation ?\""], [18, "12 VERONIA. \" Would you really like to hear the his tory of my defection from faith to in credulity ?\" asked Van Helder, whom a rapid glance at the features of his companion had convinced ofthe deep interest which he took in the theme. \" But no ! were it even a possible task, it would be too difficult a one for any man to trace exactly the phases through which both mind and heart must have passed before the hopes and associations of his youth were lost sight of for ever. Looking back to aU that passed through my own thoughts at that period of life, it appears now to me like a dream, so vague, unsettled, and confused are all im pressions connected Avith it, save the final results left upon my mind. I know only that my early education upon these points had been more carefully, nay, severely, pur sued by the mother \u2014 to whose guardianship my father's death had left me \u2014 than that of most youths ; all speculation, all that could lead in thought remotely from the beaten track, was forbidden me absolutely. This may explain in part how I imbibed a taste for free inquiry.\""], [19, "13 VERONIA. \" And free inquiry ended then in doubt, as it too often does, when the objects of that inquiry are not legitimate ? \" said the Mar quis, sadly and interrogatively. But at the words Van Helder's eyes flashed fire, his tone had the metaUic sharpness which passion sometimes infused into it as he said scorn fully: \" Legitimate ! yes, that is the watchword of aU dogmatic creeds whatever ; it met me upon the threshold of life, when I began first to observe and to draw conclusions from my own reasoning powers and ex perience ; when I first began to dream of the amelioration of man's ills on earth, and remained paralyzed with pity and astonish ment on beholding his manifold miseries and inconsistencies. My doubts and my hopes were alike trampled on, for they were not, I was told, legitimate. I was young then, and at that word I faltered : I have learnt instead to laugh now.\" Half in wonder, half in pity, St. Gregoire looked up into his companion's face, as the latter concluded this speech, which he had delivered in the breathless and almost des-"], [20, "14 VERONIA. perate manner peculiar to him when his feelings were stirred. Every mobile feature had played its part, every inflexion of the voice had told its tale. Gifted, like all his countrymen, with no mean powers of obser vation, the Frenchman had noted aU these signs, until combined, they formed no un true image in his mind of the eccentric being whose sophistry and scepticism seemed the result of that strange blending in him of peculiar keenness and vigorous intellect, with an entire absence of sufficient logic to balance them. That he could laugh indeed, and that on most inappropriate occasions, the Marquis had received rather unpleasant proofs, but that he was no cynic the trembling voice and still more quivering lip gave ample evi dence. \" Wild, extraordinary creature,\" thought the Marquis ; \" what, I Avonder, will be his next expression of opinion?\" and while he was thus thinking, Van Helder recommenced \u2014 \" So that, you see, Monsieur le Marquis, I am not one of your fashionable Parisian infidels, who have never taken the trouble"], [21, "15 VERONIA. to ask themselves why they do not believe, but a man who has thought upon the sub ject, and suffered by it, too ; and having said so much, we may perhaps turn to something else.\" \" Certainly, monsieur,\" returned the Frenchman ; \" but, Avhile thanking you for the confidence you have accorded me, pardon me if I cannot refrain from one single remark relative to it, namely, that I feel convinced you wiU one day revise in your mind all these unhappy conclusions, and come then to a far different one \u2014 come, in fact, to see that, because there are more professors of religion than real Christians, that is no reason for doubting of the faith itself ; and that, though the world were fiUed with even more pain and evil than actuaUy exists, that would in no Avay alter the fact of its Creator being infinitely good and merciful, since it is evident that sin alone has produced misery, and that it is the Creator's wish to see his creatures happy.\" \"Exactly so,\" returned Van Helder, eagerly ; \"precisely my own view. All"], [22, "16 VERONIA. creatures \u2014 and men pre-eminently \u2014 were intended to be happy \u2014 and might be so, even in such a world as we inhabit, were things only properly re-organized and managed.\" \" I should Uke much, monsieur, to hear what are your ideas as to the means neces sary for reforming society, with a view to so desirable a consummation,\" said the Marquis, smilingly, and not sorry to turn his companion's arguments from the slippery ground of theological interests to a less delicate one. Van Helder perceived the smile ; it piqued him to throw his best energies into another channel, where there might be a greater chance of exercising them with success, and accordingly he prepared to launch boldly into it. \" I think,\" said he, stopping short to re move his hat, and, at the same time, running his fingers through his hair in a manner which instantly transmuted it into the kind of elfin forest we have elsewhere described \u2014 \" I think that if man were more carefully to cultivate his reasoning faculties, a thousand of the ills would cease which"], [23, "17 VERONIA. warp his life at present ; a thousand sources of deUght he little dreams of noAV Avould open to him. For I believe that he was formed \u2014 no less than all other creatures \u2014 for a happy, a beautiful existence : not merely for exemption from those miseries we see around us, but for a measure of enjoyment as fuU and free as that of the Avild horse that bounds along its native prairies. And hoAv, you ask, is this to be attained ? Only by the due enlightened employment of his immense, his splendid faculties. There is to be found his best means of happiness ; but this truth he has despised, trodden under foot, outraged, and the punishment that has fallen upon him is only commensurate with the offence \u2014 he is a miserable being ! Not content with having caused his own wretchedness, he turns vengefuUy upon the rest of the crea tion, and causes it to groan beneath his tyranny and crimes. And yet this wicked creature, steeped to the very lips in base ness and error of every sort, has stiU within him some smouldering ashes of a purer fire, which needs only to be softly blown on to VOL. II. c"], [24, "18 VERONIA. kindle into grandeur. He knows \u2014 he feels it too ; but relentlessly he stifles its faintest gleams. Ignorance and error have become his element, and he trembles at the effort necessary to emerge thence. Oh ! humanity ! poor humanity ! How often, like Cain, dost thou not lift up thy head and cry \u2014 ' My punishment is greater than I can bear !' \" \" Somewhere, in the recesses of your mind, monsieur, there surely lurks some dream of what Ave quiet men call a Utopia ; some vision of an earth-perfected state, in which all would be made right \u2014 is it not so ?\" asked the Marquis, after a moment's pause, during Avhich Van Helder replaced his hat, and drew a long, deep breath re sembling a sigh. \" Can anything be worse than that in Avhich Ave Uve at present?\" was the warm rejoinder. \"It might be greatly better, doubtless; but what, Doctor, Avould you suggest as a means of such improvement?\" said the philosopher, evasively replying by another question."], [25, "VERONIA. 19 \" Why \u2014 since man has passed successively through aU the stages of savage life, patriarchal Use, the era of barbarism, and the Middle Ages, until he has reached this present state caUed civiliza tion ; why \u2014 I repeat, is it so ridiculous to suppose that in process of time he may arrive at a stiU better one \u2014 one, in fact, from whence he wiU look back upon this epoch as we now look back on that of barbarism ?\" \"Nothing is impossible, certainly,\" answered St. Gregoire, with a smile, \" and what, monsieur, will that happier time be called?\" \" The period of Harmony ! \" They were both silent. That single word revealed all Van Helder's theory, and in the threefold character of Catholic, Con servative, and Noble, the Marquis was startled, and for an instant he recoiled. Van Helder felt, without looking at his companion, the impression he had produced, yet he continued : \u2014 \" The originator of this glorious prospect came neither as a legislator, nor as the c2"], [26, "20 VERONIA. founder of a religion ; his pretensions were restricted to one single thing, \u2014 simple, yet how sublime, \u2014 the happiness, the rescue, of his felloAV-men !\" The Doctor's voice had softened graduaUy, and he now ceased, as if descending re verentially from his hobby to earth again. St. Gregoire scanned him very attentiA7ely for a moment or tAvo, and the effect of this observation Avas to mount the Marquis upon his own, on which he cantered off com placently as foUows."], [27, "21 CHAPTER II. \" Logic is perfect as an instrument ; but ere we permit it to lead us far, it needs to be ascertained that the whole of the fundamental conditions are known, and that of the multitude of forces which spring from the primal unity, and concur in the production of real phenomena, our survey has omitted none.

Nichol. \" You were born, monsieur, under the united influence of Mercury and Mars ; but Mercury preponderated, and I should say that the Moon also had no inconsiderable share of influence over you,\" was St. Gregoire's remark, very seriously uttered after the investigating look which, as we have said, he had turned upon Van Helder. \" I beg your pardon, monsieur ; but does"], [28, "22 VERONIA. that mean that I am a lunatic ?\" was the astonished Doctor's rejoinder. \" By no means. Her influence over you is of the most favourable kind. To her you owe, perhaps, the vague colour of your eyes, and the undecided hue, but certainly silky texture of your hair ; it is she, also, who has bestowed on you that love of the ideal, that keen appreciation of, and aspira tion towards, the beautiful and, \u2014 pardon me, \u2014 something of that tendency to eccen tricity which characterise you. Mars has made your nose aquiline, gifted you with the piercing look, the quick conception, rapid utterance, energy of language, native humour, and \u2014 pardon me again \u2014 that spirit of incredulity, and perhaps love of dispute, which are equaUy evident in you ; but Mercury it is which predominates, because from Mercury come the pecuUar tint of your complexion, and the changeful character of your expression ; the organs of causahty and comparison, which occupy so prominent a place upon your brow, Avith that of wonder further back ; the distinction in a.word. monsieur, of your person,\" \u2014 and"], [29, "23 VERONIA. he bowed, \u2014 \" the vocation which made you a man of science, instead of a mere dreamer ; the taste for philosophic research, which, joined to the quality of comparison I have mentioned, the yearning after perfection, and the clearness of perception Avhich this planet gives, wiU one day lead you to venerate much which you have hitherto mistaken and despised.\" Truly Van Helder justified at this moment the Marquis's definition of his changeful capa cities of feature, for as he stood listening Avith open mouth, raised eyebrows, and the organ of w7onder evidently in full exercise, no one would have recognized in him the im passioned speaker of an instant before. St. Gregoire's smUe at this metamorphosis broke the speU, and restored to the Doctor his power of speech. \" Curious \u2014 very curious, to be sure. Astrology, monsieur, is it not?\" asked he, at length, looking up with childhke surprise into the Marquis's face. \" The science of Hermes, certainly \u2014 magic, and no magic \u2014 as I explained last night. But I forgot, monsieur, that the subject"], [30, "24 VERONIA. does not interest you ; we will talk of some thing else.\" \" On the contrary, Monsieur le Marquis, you have excited my interest about it, if only by this remarkable portrait of myself; besides, I have thought a good deal, before meeting you this morning, about that strange scene at MarceUi's, which you described to us, and I should like beyond everything to witness something of the sort, if you were good enough to put me in the way of it.\" \" With great pleasure. There wiU be a seance to-day at two o'clock. If you will do me the honour of returning to my hotel with me to breakfast, I shaU be happy to accompany you there afterwards.\" Van Helder eagerly accepted the invita tion, and then inquired what had been first the means of drawing St. Gregoire's atten tion to these subjects \"I think,\" replied the latter, \"that the very first thing that attracted my attention seriously was a letter written by a man of science, the Doctor Alex-Mayer, editor of the Presse Medicate. His argument, that"], [31, "25 VERONIA. investigation into these matters might pro duce evidence tending to counterbalance the materialistic leanings of the age, made a great impression on me.\" \"And, notwithstanding your reUgious comdctions, monsieur, you conceive these sciences to be legitimate subjects of study?\" asked Van Helder, calling to mind his conversation of the previous evening with the chess-player. \" So far as they do not give the Ue to Catholic truth, I do so, and hitherto I have met with nothing that has contradicted my former impression \u2014 viz., that they are real sciences, which have been on the one hand abused, and on the other misrepresented, because misunderstood. At the same time, I perfectly understand the objection of our clergy to seeing them become familiarized among the faithful. The experiment of approaching a barrel of gunpowder with a Ughted candle is hardly a safe one ; and the Church is always on the prudent side. Now as ever she is right.\" On arriving at his own residence, St. Gregoire placed in the Doctor's hand the"], [32, "26 VERONIA. letter he had alluded to, but as it is scarcely probable our readers have not met with it, we shall not reproduce it here. Two o'clock had just struck Avhen the Marquis and Van Helder entered the car riage which Avas to convey them to Marcelli's door. They had to mount some flights of dusty stairs before reaching their destination, and having then knocked at a door, which was stealthily opened to receive them, they were admitted by a domestic, Avho received their money in silence, and ushered them into the reception-room. It was an ordinary sized chamber, meanly furnished. A table stood in the centre, AAith a chair placed before it in such a manner that its occupant should face aU present. Several persons were already grouped around it, and as our two gentle men entered subdued and earnest tones feU on their ears. The subject of discussion was Alexis the somnambulist. The assembly was composed of persons all apparently belonging to the respectable classes of society, and amongst them were"], [33, "VERONIA. 27 several ecclesiastics, and not a few other grave-looking professional men. The Marquis was looking about in search of seats, when he observed vacant places upon a couch at the end of the apartment, and he drew Van Helder toAvards it. Tavo persons already seated there made way for them, and Van Helder's attention was thus attracted towards them. They Avere a young man and woman of sufficiently ordinary appearance to have passed unnoticed but for tAvo circumstances. These were their being alike attired in the very deepest mourning, and also the expres sion of grief, tinged with a sort of. horror, which rested upon their features, and which, besides having been evidently quite freshly caUed forth, seemed as it were to have taken their souls suddenly and by violence. \" While he was yet observing them, and compassionating the destiny which had so early tinged their lives with bitterness, a murmur announced the entrance of Alexis, and Van Helder's attention was immedi ately drawn towards the somnambulist. The Doctor marked with surprise his pale"], [34, "28 VERONIA. and stolid countenance, overspread with a sort of dull suffering, which appeared to be its habitual expression, and accorded with the heavy languor which pervaded his movements as he cast around upon the assembly a singularly careless and unin terested glance, and threw himself into the chair destined for him. A tall figure, wrapped in a dark robe which simulated well the floAving garments of the Magi, now stepped forAvard. It was Marcelli, who, seating himself behind his subject, and placing a hand upon his shoulder, seemed to concentrate his atten tion exclusively upon him. A profound silence testified the interest of the spectators, on whom the looks of Alexis continued to rest with the same strange apathy as before. Suddenly, and while all eyes were fixed upon him in re turn, a thrill seemed to pervade his frame, he shuddered violently, a convulsion passed over his features, which, as the mesmerist withdrew his hand, almost instantaneously assumed the rigidity of death. At this moment MarceUi rose, and ad-"], [35, "VERONIA. 29 dressing all present in an unconcerned tone, invited them to test the somnambulism of his subject. AU dreAV stUl closer round the table, and a gentleman stepping forward accepted the chaUenge by throwing a pack of cards upon the table and requesting Alexis to play. The latter, who seemed perfectly aware of what was required of him, acquiesced, and his eyes having been first closely bandaged under the superinten dence of his intended opponent, the game commenced \u2014 the spectators, meanwhile, looking on in the same attentive silence as before. As it progressed the gentleman testified alternate symptoms of astonish ment and vexation, and within a very few moments he rose defeated. A succession of games foUowed, and were all attended with the same result, after which the cards were removed and the somnambulist's eyes unbandaged. A person who had hitherto stood rather in the background now came forward, and seating himself by the side of Alexis, re quested the latter faithftdly to answer certain questions about to be addressed to"], [36, "30 VERONIA. him. The speaker was a tall, handsome, and rather roue species of the mulatto \u2014 weU dressed, and with that air of easy con fidence which betokens a man satisfied with his worldly position, and not ill-pleased with himself. \" Ask Alexis whatever you please, mon sieur,\" said the physician, in acknowledg ment of the request ; \" but first give him your hand to establish the rapport betAveen you.\" The mulatto obeyed with a contemp tuous smile and shrug of the shoulders, as if to protest beforehand against all jugglery, and to express his opinion that it was such. Alexis Avithout looking at him \u2014 indeed, his eyes had never for an instant relaxed from their fixed and stony stare \u2014 took the prof fered hand, held it a moment silently within his OAvn, and then said, \u2014 \" Speak \u2014 what is it you wish to knoAv ? \" \" Oh, many things. I warn you that I shall prove a troublesome customer,\" re torted the stranger with a derisive laugh. \" First, if you please, describe to me what"], [37, "31 VERONIA. is passing at this moment in my home ; mention some of the peculiar features of the spot where it is situated, and its name among nations.\" Alexis, who had Ustened Avith the same impenetrable aspect that a corpse might have worn, was not long silent, and when he spoke it was briefly, but in a dreamy tone, to the following effect : \u2014 \" You are a native of \" (naming a West India island) ; \" your home is situated in its chief town. You inhabit a large house forming the corner of a street, and facing a church, which you never attend. Round the dwelling I see traces of the recent ravages of fire. Some time since these premises were in fact nearly destroyed by this element. The catastrophe was averted only by the prudent and active exertions of an aged woman, who is at this moment superintending the tasks of a number of negroes. She has a harsh aspect and they fear her, though she is of their blood \u2014 but she is not cruel in the main.\" \" My mother ! \" exclaimed the mulatto,"], [38, "32 VERONIA. as Alexis ceased speaking ; \" how could you know this? But tell me, how is my son ? \" The somnambulist was silent, apparently either unable or unwilling to ansAver this question, which the stranger impatiently repeated. \"\u25a0 Hush ! \u2014 be silent 1 \" exclaimed Alexis, Avith a vivacity he had not yet shown. \" How dare you speak of an unlaAvful tie ? By what right do you claim the title of father, who have never borne that of hus band ? \" The general observation to which this abrupt rebuke immediately subjected the object of it, appeared to try even his self possession, for, with an assumed smile and gesture of contempt, he rose and re treated.

But the latter only grasped him more firmly in return, and would not be dis missed ; a heavy moisture stood upon his features, and his voice trembled with mingled grief and passion, as he recom menced his interrogations, Avhile the un concealed interest and sympathy of the spectators imposed silence on the magnetist, whose restlessness betokened his anxiety for the release of his patient, Alexis having begun to show symptoms of that agonizing condition which is the consequence of over taxed strength or sensibility to those under the influence of the magnetic sleep. \" You must stay in that chamber until you have answered all,\" insisted the dead man's son, imperiously. \"I will not be denied, \u2014 the peace of my Avhole life depends"], [45, "39 VERONIA. upon it.

It was that of Madame de Mont Brison, a Avidow, to use the delicate French term, not encore jeune, but jeune encore. What may be the exact age to which this phrase applies we leave it to the personal views of our readers to determine. Suffice it to say that the lady in question might have almost dispensed with the"], [48, "42 VERONIA. elaborate aids with which French art was caUed on to contribute to her charms, and have even then appeared a very pretty woman, although of the purely \" wax-doll \" species. An exquisitely delicate fair skin, light blue, surprised-looking eyes, a profusion of soft broAvn hair, frizzed almost to the trans parency of a cloud, and a small mouth, garnished with pearly teeth, completed her attractions. Her figure possessed no pecu liar beauties, but any deficiency in out line was atoned for by that perfect elegance of deportment and grace of moA7ement which make aU other details seem matters of scarcely any moment. Left, by the death of both parents, an orphan very young, Hermenie de Mont Brison had been entrusted, together with the little fortune she possessed, to the guardianship of her father's nearest surviv ing relative, the venerable Duke de Rochefierre, who had amply redeemed the pledge in the eyes of society, by giving her an aux oiseaux education, and afterwards uniting her in the holy bonds of matrimony"], [49, "VERONIA. 43 to a gentleman so unexceptionable, on the score of birth and manners, that every requirement Avas felt, and universally admitted, to have been perfectly fulfilled. But although so accomplished a person, Monsieur de Mont Brison had faults, of which the good Duke, and, indeed, the world in general, kneAV nothing; amongst the most inveterate of these was the love of play. Within a very few years after his marriage it had reduced him \u2014 to a broken heart, said his friends \u2014 to a premature and self-inflicted death, said rumour. But, be this as it may, his Avidow remained, Avith little besides her original dowry, and a mansion, which, for the honour of her name, it was decided she should still continue to occupy. To say much more concerning her Avould be superfluous, inasmuch as her own words avUI paint her with infinitely more justice than we could pretend to do. \" So, then,\" said this lady, inquisitively eyeing Van Helder, as he sat erect and solemn before her, while she half reclined in an attitude of careless grace in a"], [50, "44 VERONIA. causeuse near him \u2014 \" so then our dear cousin \" \u2014 she always spoke by this title of De Boisvante \u2014 \"is in your country, Monsieur le Docteur ; have you any idea what can have induced him to go there ?\" \"Not the slightest, madame,\" answered Van Helder, Avith imperturbable serious ness, piqued, for once in his life, to the practice of discretion by the unmistakable sparkle of curiosity in the lady's eyes. \" I should suppose, however, it might very probably be a taste for the picturesque.\" \" The picturesque in Flanders !

While aU these scenes were passing, Adrian de Boisvante had been doing penance to a degree which the wildest flight of his Parisian imagination had never yet conceived as possible, and which indeed, in connection with such a being, weU nigh realized the idea of breaking a butterfly upon the wheel. The old Flemish city, with its dim sky, deserted streets, and old-world aspect, seemed to him a vast prison, a sort of tomb, and more than once had he looked on the dusky waters of its long canals with a sort of delirious wish for the oblivion which must, as he thought, be found at least be neath them."], [60, "54 VERONIA. Like a fly webbed inextricably into a net, through the mazes of which the world seemed removed to an incalculable distance, he felt paralyzed, helpless, and yet irritated almost to madness; obliged to look on calmly, as if content, while the links of his chain seemed riveted more tightly every hour. It was Justine who enacted here the part of the spider, the jovial Bouchard having delegated to her the task so con genial to her tastes and adapted to her powers. The first step of Bouchard had been to put himself into communication with the parties mentioned by De Boisvante, by means of which proceeding he had secured witnesses to the young man's position, who would be very useful in case of his turning restive or unreasonable ; and another tactic had been, while holding out to these suffi cient prospect of payment to tranquillize them and stop all violent proceedings for the time being, yet by feeding them with promises only to retain such a hold over their unlucky debtor as should completely break his spirit and bring him to their level."], [61, "VERONIA. 55 Very much, indeed, like Rarey's treat ment of a vicious horse, was the system to which the Frenchman's mercurial spirit had been subjected, and exactly with the same result.

All was going well, as weU as possible, if he would but have patience, but an imprudent word or movement Avould ruin all. His enemies were to be compromised with, such being the truest policy ; and having placed his business in Bouchard's hands, of course he must let that gentleman manage it ac cording to his own judgment, unless indeed he preferred to take back the trust. Such was the language held to him, and passively he yielded to it. There were moments when, rendered desperate by the protracted strain upon his nerves and temper, he would have risked all and thrown himself upon his uncle's mercy; but this course was now closed to him for ever \u2014 he felt that for the errors and extravagances of his youth, there might just possibly have been forgiveness, but for the baseness he had contemplated \u2014 never.

He was thinking of the cruel bloAv which such a disclosure would give to Veronia's pride ; that pride which, with the infatua tion of love, he could not blame in her, even while suffering so cruelly from its effects, and the generosity of his nature recoiled from inflicting on it so keen a punishment. He recalled their last meet ing \u2014 the discussion which had revealed to him how deeply the prejudice of caste was rooted in her character, and the impres sion then left on his mind of the impass-"], [73, "VERONIA. 67 able gulf which layfor ever between them. Should he be the one to throw across it the bridge of a forced obligation, Avhich would leave her no choice but humbly to extend to him the hand of gratitude ? Most of his sex would have gladly ansAvered in the affirmative ; but the heart of Henricart was noble, and answered \" No!\" \" Spare her, spare her,\" pleaded Love, \" this sad humiliation,\" and Love as ever, when true to his divine nature, gained the day, and crushed his selfish rival, Passion. \" Monsieur le Cure,\" said Henricart, at last, in slightly tremulous accents, \" promise me that you wiU mention to no one this very trifling act of charity, and I shall be content. I wiU explain it later to the Doctor, and induce him to accept my views, which he will, I have no doubt, understand and approve. I know that I am acting rightly, and trust this will suffice to you; meantime, I have the honour to wish you good evening.\" \" Good evening, monsieur, and may Heaven reward your good intentions,\" re turned the puzzled Cure, as he escorted his f2"], [74, "68 VERONIA. visitor to the door of the apartment, and in another moment the latter stood alone upon his road homewards. The priest remained for a few moments absorbed in reflections. Henricart's ill concealed emotion had started in his mind a train of wild conjectures, in Avhich the Frenchman's mysterious fortunes, those of Veronia, and the conversation overheard by Van Helder, aU were confounded together in perplexing combination. \" During the five-and-twenty years that I have governed this parish,\" thought he, \" so many inexpli cable circumstances have never before come under my observation. God grant it may all end weU ; and, as yet, Van Helder's strange departure is the most unsatisfactory part of it \u2014 just at this moment, too, Avhen his presence was so much required !\" \"WiU Meinheer come to supper?\" here asked Godensca, looking in, \" because I am going afterwards with Beth to the stranger's. She and Frau Ana wanted to get the Fraulein away before the corpse is moved to the kirk-yard, and I said Lav ould help them.\" \"Go, by all means, Godensca, and see that the poor child wants nothing we can"], [75, "69 VERONIA. do for her \u2014 it is a sad case, very ! The funeral takes place to-morrow, at nine o'clock, and I shall visit her while the vicar is celebrating it.\" \" A second-class funeral,\" muttered Godensca to herself, as she returned to her kitchen \u2014 the hour that ceremony was fixed at having initiated her into this secret. \"Well, they must be richer than folks thought them \u2014 no one expected more than a third-class one, I'll be bound.\" But, though burningwith curiosity to learn how this could be, the handmaiden's respect for her master in all that appertained to his sacred functions, restrained the question that she would fain have asked ; but she compensated herself for this effort of self denial by the administration of rather strong language to Jacco, a kick in the ribs to Cauvin, and a good deal of indistinct grumbling over the supper-table on some subject connected with the manner in which the Cure that evening partook of his buttermilk, all of which was submitted to by the latter with the placidity which, as we are told, was ever displayed by Socrates under similar domestic circumstances."], [76, "70 CHAPTER VI. As from a dreamless, deathlike sleep, yet faint and troubled, Veronia woke again to life and feeling. It was night, yet she soon became aware that she was lying in the outer room, where all was darkness, while from beneath the closed door of the interior one issued a stream of light. All was still : a figure seated at the foot of the couch she lay on had drooped fonvard into the attitude of repose. It was that of Beth, who, weary with watch ing had sunk into the heavy sleep of youth and health ; the sound of her breathing alone broke the silence, and aroused Veronia to a sense of outward things."], [77, "71 VERONIA. Why in that room, and not as usual by her mother's side ? \u2014 why the closed door betAveen them and the bright, bright rays that issued thence ? Vainly the overwrought brain and feeble senses tried to solve the problem ; some thing was wrong, but what it was they failed to bring to her remembrance. She rose from her pilloAv, stepped to the ground, and reeled against the waU from utter weakness. Even this sound did not disturb the sleeper, and with another effort Veronia crossed the chamber, laid a trembling hand upon the door of the inner one, and pushed it open. There in an instant the truth was presented to her ! Wound in her grave-clothes Madame de Mehul lay, still within her bed, as if asleep, but the light falling on her features re vealed the swathed jaw, grim brow, and stony aspect of death. Close at hand was the temporary altar it is usual among Catholics to erect beside the dead \u2014 a table covered with a linen cloth, on which was placed a crucifix between"], [78, "72 A7ER0NIA. two lighted candles, and a vessel filled with holy water. At this table, and facing the corpse, knelt the figure of a nun ; a rosary hung on her clasped hands, and her eyes were fixed on the image of death before her, which offered a wonderful contrast to her own fair, delicately-blooming face and youthful figure. She was praying, undis turbed by that ghastly presence, uncon scious of terror or distress. All young and fair as was her person, more beautiful was yet the soul thus immolating youth, beauty, and all the glowing joys of time to one shadoAvy, distant hope of the unseen in eternity ! She started as Veronia's entrance made the light flicker on the features of the dead, and then, on seeing her, sprang forward, as if to interpose between the latter and a sight so harrowing ; but Veronia pushed her desperately aside, and advancing to the bed, threw herself on her knees beside it, and burying her face in its funereal drapery burst into passionate and convulsive sobs. \" Let her weep,\" said the nun, as Beth,"], [79, "73 VERONIA. aroused by this last circumstance, hastened to the spot, and would have torn the unhappy girl away. \" Let her weep \u2014 it is best so, since the shock could not be averted ; the crisis will do her good, and perhaps save her from an illness. Poor thing ! \u2014 so desolate as she is noAv ; but God knows best, Fraulein \u2014 be sure it is all sent to her in mercy.\" And so the bereaved daughter wept out the first keen agony of her affliction. Hour after hour passed away, and still her tears flowed on, while still her two companions knelt and prayed, until they noted how gradually the anguish seemed to wane as the mourner's strength faded away ; and when daylight began to creep into the chamber, to dim the burning tapers and render yet more ghastly the rigid face beneath them, she sank exhausted, and scarcely conscious, to the ground. Then gently and pityingly they raised and bore her once more to the outer room, where, laid again upon the couch, crushed, broken, and worn out by sorrow, she slept ere long pro foundly."], [80, "74 VERONIA. Where is the happy being who counts not among his memories one dreadful day, the morrow of a grief like this ? Terrible as may be the first moments of a similar affliction, how still more dreadful is the dull, aching, festering pang of after thoughts! The knowledge that, for ever and for ever, the tie of mortal love is broken \u2014 the agony of feeling that the heart's bit terest remorse can never noAV efface a pain that has been caused, nor all its tears of blood atone for some small kindness that has been left undone I Think of this, ye who have still the loved ones left to you on earth ! Think of it in time, lest, too late, the thought may fasten upon you like \" the worm that dieth not, and the fire that is not quenched.\" The best, the tenderest, the most devoted are liable to be assailed by such feelings, and Veronia was recalled to them by her next awakening. Again it was evening, as she sprang up with a thought of terror at the reality she had to face. Pale and piteous was the figure that sat erect, and stared with despair-"], [81, "VERONIA. 75 ing eyes upon a group gathered in whis pered consultation at one end of the chamber. Beth, Henricart, and Godensca composed it. Veronia had only once be fore, and that for a brief instant, seen the latter, and her wearied brain scarcely recognized the others before she had throAvn herself from the couch and reached the door of the inner apartment. The hasp turned in her hand, but did not open ; in another instant Beth was beside her, and had clasped her in her arms. \" Mademoiselle, Fraulein, I entreat you to desist ; ' the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.' We love you, we have prayed for you ; oh ! try, for the sake of the good Jesus, to be resigned.\" \"Stand aside,\" said Veronia, hoarsely; \"shall a child be parted from her mother thus ? She is dead, I know it, but until she is laid in the grave my place is by her side. Open, open ! \" she continued, knock ing frantically at the door ; \" until you do so, I wiU never quit the spot.\" \" Mein lieber Jesus!\" ejaculated Go densca, as a glance of perplexity passed be-"], [82, "76 VERONIA. tween herself and Beth ; \" she is capable of acting as she says ; what can be done ? It is pitiful to see her, to be sure.\" \" Be silent only, do not contradict me,\" said Henricart, in a half- whisper ; \" I will answer for all,\" and approaching Veronia gently and gravely, he took her tAvo hands into his own. \" MademoiseUe, for the sake of the de parted listen to me, for I stand here in the place of him who valued and respected her so deeply. She is here no longer ; while you slept they removed her to the house of the priest who accompanied you here last night. Fraulein Beth and I awaited only your awakening to conduct you hence \u2014 will you come, we are at your service ab solutely ?\" Doubtful, bewildered, and trembling, Veronia looked up into the pale, serious face bent now so pityingly above her OAvn, and, as he released respectfully the hands which he had held only such a brief instant in his own, her bruised heart turned to him with that instinctive trust and reverence which is the best homage of the forlorn."], [83, "77 VERONIA. She bowed her head silently, for her voice failed her, and she could only Aveep. \" 'Twas bold, though ! \" said Godensca, aside to Beth. \" A Avhite lie, hoAvever, wiU hurt nobody, and deceives her only for the best ; but only Henricart, or the Uke of him, could have done it.\" \" Why is that door closed ?\" murmured Veronia, faintly, through her sobs, as Beth aided her to get on a shawl and bonnet, preparatory to quitting the dwelling; \"and Avhere \u2014 Avhere is she, did he say ?\" \" You are going to our house, dear Fraulein,\" answered the conscientious Beth, evasively ; \" she died a child of holy Church in intention, you knoAv, and it is to us you belong now \u2014 is it not?\" \" Yes,\" ansAvered Veronia, vaguely, but with unquiet eyes still fixed upon the fastened door ; \"but why may I not enter the other chamber ? \u2014 why has it been locked?\" \" We thought, Fraulein, it was more decent, as there were strangers here ; and then the sister took the key, thinking it better you should go there no more ; \" and"], [84, "78 VERONIA. this was true, only that it was still on the other side of the lock. Equipped and satisfied, Veronia had taken the arm that Henricart advanced to offer her, when Godensca stepped before them and tendered her a glass of hot spiced- Avine. \" Drink, Fraulein,\" said she, emphatically, \" it will give you strength, and Meinheer Pastor sent it from his own cellar.\" \" I cannot,\" replied the trembling girl, turning from the offered draught in disgust ; \" I feel as though I should never more re quire nourishment of any kind in this world;\" but Henricart took the wine silently, and held it to her, and again instinctively she obeyed the gentle gravity of his glance, and raised the glass to her lips. \" I shall follow you,\" said Godensca, di recting a significant, glance, unobserved by Mademoiselle de Mehul, towards the cham ber of death. \"You, Beth, go with the Fraulein and Meinheer Henricart \u2014 Ana is waiting for you all impatiently.\" And so, between these two devoted ones, Veronia left the threshold of so much sorrow."], [85, "VERONIA. 79 What a night was that for the kind hearts of Ana and of Beth ! On discovering the deception that had been practised on her \u2014 for, Avhen once safely beneath their roof, the sisters' conscientious scruples induced them to break it gently to her \u2014 Veronia's agony was terrible to witness. She would have rushed out into the dark night, and retraced her footsteps across the lonely \" dunes,\" had not Godensca's timely arrival, at a moment when the fortitude of the re luctant jailers was giving way, opposed a sturdy obstacle. \" She is half wild,\" said the handmaiden, decisively ; \" and as Uke as not to run and drown herself in the canal; so, if you daren't hold her back, I will ; \" and the speaker threw her brawny arms around the unhappy girl, Avhose vain struggles soon gave place to a fit of passionate weeping, that, weak as she already was, soon left her totaUy exhausted. \" Is her bed rf ady ? \" asked Godensca, when Veronia's head drooped helplessly upon her shoulder ; and, on receiving an affirmative reply, she lifted Mademoiselle"], [86, "80 VERONIA. de Meliul in her strong arms, as if the latter had been a mere feather's weight, and Avithout assistance bore her upstairs, and into the little chamber which had been pre pared already for her. Gently, as if Vero nia had been a little child, Godensca laid her upon the snoAvy couch which it contained, and in a moment, with Beth's assistance, had disrobed her, clothed her in a homely night-dress of the latter's, and then placed her unresisting form between the sheets. \"Now I must go, for it is getting late, but I shall come down again to-morroAV, after Meinheer's mass and breakfast, and he wiU be here himself shortly after. So, good night, Ana \u2014 good night, Beth ; you can manage her now, I daresay ; \" and hastily giving a final and composing stroke to the bedclothes, Godensca hurried aAvay. SloAvly the long hours of night passed; slowly to the sisters, who took by turns the office of watcher by the mourner's bed, and more slowly still to her, whose grief almost denied repose. Yet only once during those stUl hours was their silence broken by a thrilling cry"], [87, "VERONIA. 81 of anguish from the bed, \" Mother ! 0 mo ther ! I come ! \" A cruel dream of the reality had broken the slumber into which utter exhaustion had thrown Veronia, and, starting up she would have sprung away had not the watch ful Ana held her back, with words of sym pathy and soothing. Faithful to her promise, Godensca was at the vicarage betimes \u2014 precursor of her mas ter's promised visit. Henricart soon joined her, and a consultation then commenced with Ana, as to the propriety of breaking to MademoiseUe de Mehul the news of the approaching funeral. \" Meinheer Pastor wiU know best how to do it,\" said the former, authoritatively ; \" and that's just what he is coming for;\" but this plan w7as destined to be upset by Veronia herself. With the first glimpse of day she had risen softly, while the tired Beth \u2014 Avho had then replaced her sister \u2014 slumbered by her side. She dressed, stole to the door, and now startled the conclave below by suddenly appearing among them. Henricart started with pity and surprise VOL. II. G"], [88, "82 VERONIA. at the wan figure silently advancing, and Godensca, still more astonished, stepped rapidly between it and the door, as if deter mined to bar the passage. At this moment there was a knock, and the Cure entered. From beneath his shade he gave a rapid glance around, and then immediately approached Veronia. \"Whither, my child, Avere you going?\" asked he, gently. \" So early, too, you must be fasting, I am sure.\" \" Yes, Meinheer \u2014 the Fraulein has this instant left her chamber \u2014 she must break fast now, before anything else, must she not ? \" said Ana, quickly ; \" she has tasted nothing these two days past.\" \" I want no food, so it is useless to de tain me,\" said Veronia, resolutely, moving as she spoke towards the door. \"Let me pass, if you have human feeling,\" added she, addressing Henricart, who stood beside it ; \" my place is by the dead.\" \" Mademoiselle \" \u2014 commenced the latter imploringly, but a gesture from the Cure\" interrupted him. \" Go, my children, leave us a few mo-"], [89, "83 VERONIA. ments,\" said he, quietly; \"the Fraulein will listen for an instant to an old man like my self, I am sure ; and then she shall depart, if she wiU.\" \" Monsieur le Cure,\" began Veronia, in a choking voice, when they were alone, \" I have been cruelly and wickedly deceived ; brought here under the belief that \" Her voice faltered at the recollection, and her tears flowed again. \" Would not she have wished to spare you the sorrow of so useless and sad a watch ? \" asked the priest, soothingly ; \" the good souls whom you complain of, thought so, my child, and if they erred, their charitable intentions must be their excuse.\" \" 'Tis weU ; but now that so few hours are left before she will be laid in the grave, they would deprive me of the last consola tion of viewing her again ; but it is useless, their barbarity shall be defeated, and no power shaU keep me here longer.\" \" Stay, Mademoiselle de Mehul,\" said the priest, with grave decision as she laid her hand upon the latch ; \"you are amongst strangers, and our ways are not, perhaps, g2"], [90, "84 VERONIA. like yours. We wished to spare you pain, and have acted with that view; whether well or ill, God be the judge ; but it is too late to alter what has been done \u2014 even now the mortal ashes of your mother are on their road to their last earthly resting-place. Is it not better to spend the Uttle strength you noAV possess in paying to her memory the last solemn duty of following them thither, than to have incapacitated yourself from so doing* by indulgence in a selfish and useless sorrow? Be courageous, then, my child, for her sake, whose repentant spirit needs your prayers; cast a hopeful glance forAvard, and resign the irrevocable past to God.\" With a look of agony she had sunk doAvn on hearing the truth, that all sight of the beloved dead was over for ever in this Avorld. A fierce, a bitter struggle against the dreadful necessity of resignation shook for a moment her Avorn and wearied frame, but from its very violence was born the courage of despair. Since nothing else Avas * In some parts of Flanders, as well as France, this mark of respect to the dead is exacted alike from both sexes."], [91, "85 VERONIA. left, she would hug to her soul this final agony ; she would see the last clod filled into the grave, and then lie down upon it to die. The priest had anxiously watched her countenance while these thoughts were passing, and the stern resolve that settled on the pallid brow and lip convinced him that he had touched the chord he wished. He opened instantly the door through which the former group had passed, and beckoned to Ana, who had Avaited outside in expecta tion of his summons. \" Give the Fraulein some coffee, quickly,\" said he ; \" God has spoken to her heart, and given her courage to accomplish the sacred duty which so good a daughter would lament to leave unpaid. She must take some nourishment now to keep up her strength.\" The good Ana looked surprised ; a similar arrangement was the last she had expected to see recommended by him, but she said nothing, and hastily obeyed. Mechanically Veronia swalloAved a por tion of what was presented to her, and"], [92, "86 VERONIA. then, in passive silence, allowed her hostess to draw over her dress a black mantle and hood, which gave it a greater aspect of mourning. These preparations were scarcely com pleted when the sound of footsteps and murmuring voices were heard approaching the door. It opened, and shoAved without the sombre cortege, with the vicar and acolytes at its head. Pale almost as death herself, but firm and untrembling, Veronia rose ; and in stantly the hooded figures of Beth and Ana glided to her side, and passed their arms supportingly through hers. She closed her eyes as they drew her forAvard, but a whisper made her look up again. \"You will not fail; you are certain you can bear it ? \" and the pitying eyes of Henricart, filled Avith the heart's deepest sympathy, looked anxiously into her own. She bent her head silently, and he dreAv back. Led on by her two homely but sympa thising supporters, Veronia heard, as in a"], [93, "87 VERONIA. dream, the solemn chanting of the service before her. The fierce emotion she had just passed through, favoured by the stimu lus of Ana's dose of strong coffee, which now caused a false excitement, had pro duced a reaction, that, acting powerfully on her nervous system, had for a time almost obliterated the feeling of individual senti ment. The short service in the church had failed to break the spell ; they reached the grave, and still the dream was undispeUed ; but soon the chill morning air, the damp earth beneath her, recalled her physical sensibiUty, and, as a consequence, that of the mind. The coffin had been lowered, the last Avords of prayer uttered, the earth thrown upon it, and, as chief mourner, the brush of holy water was tendered to Veronia to sprinkle. Mechanically she took it, stepped to the edge of the grave, and looked doAvn into the humid depths. There lay, chiUed and silent for ever, the last, the only heart that had loved her through all ; there, never to"], [94, "88 VERONIA. issue thence, was to be imprisoned the familiar form with which were associated the sweetest memories of childhood, the tenderest recollections of her sad and blighted youth ; there \u2014 but anguish keen, piercing, and bitter as death itself, rushed over her soul, and conquered its calm. With a cry of agony she threw herself for ward, and would have fallen into the open tomb, had not a strong yet gentle grasp sustained and drawn her from the spot. A mist SAvam before her eyes, and all was becoming vague and dream-like again ; but amid the floating visions that SAvam around her, one \u2014 even at that moment of suffering \u2014 left a last impression on her brain. The tender pity, the deep sorrow of that pale face, were the last images that faded from her view."], [95, "89 CHAPTER VII. It was the night following Madame de Mehul's funeral. Sad and solitary, Jacques Henricart sat working in his lonely dwelling. A miniature in water-colours was the sub ject on which he was employed ; but ever and anon he would cast aside his brush, and, with a laboured sigh, start up and traverse the limits of his narrow chamber, as though some restless thought was busy at his heart. \" It is well so,\" said he to himself, after having Avorked at the portrait for a longer space than usual, \"another touch, per chance, might mar the likeness, and I am Aveary ; how weary, Heaven only knows.

Jacques, that it should come to this betAveen comrades such as we have been ! Look you, my friend, there must be no child's play between us.

Van Helder looked at him for a moment or two, confounded at the intensity of his emotion, and, for the first time, a faint and vague suspicion of its origin aAvoke within him. When, after a few moments, Henricart looked up, his friend hardly recognized the face of anguish noAV turned upon him. The artist's voice even Avas changed when he spoke again. \" Speak,\" said he, \" and tell me all you know \u2014 I will not shrink again ; for Made moiselle de Meliul's sake some decision must be formed.\" \" You are right, Jacques,\" said the"], [105, "VERONIA. 99 Doctor, relieved by the calming of the speaker's accent, though it Avas only that of despair. \" Listen to me one moment patiently, my dear friend, and you will see exactly how the case stands, and why your forbearance is so necessary. \" On the night Avhen you met De Bois vante at the Presbytery, some suspicions, the nature of which it is needless to explain, were excited in my mind relative to his management of the mission Avhich had brought him to this country. That mission, which had been originally confided to me, was nothing less than the discovery of a person in whom this young man's uncle, the Duke de Rochefierre \u2014 an old friend of my own family \u2014 Avas deeply con cerned. I fancied that he was on a false track, and \u2014 shall I confess it, Jacques ? \u2014 that the man of whom the Duke was in search, and whom I understood to have been wronged, might possibly be no other than yourself! I was confirmed in this view by what had passed between De Bois vant^ and yourself, and I feared that the enmity existing between you might stand Hi"], [106, "100 VERONIA. in the way of justice being done to you. Animated by this thought I determined to seek the uncle and satisfy my own mind on the subject. I went to Paris, and there the result of my inquiries was the discovery \u2014 astonishing beyond measure \u2014 that the person sought after was Veronia's father, who had married the Duke's favourite and voungest sister, greatly to the indignation of all her family. This marriage had, in fact, so separated her from them that her exist ence had been ignored by them until a \\rague rumour of her husband's death under painful circumstances, had awakened in the mind of her only surviving brother anxiety for the fate of the widow, and very natural remorse for the neglect of so many years. These had prompted a search, Avith a view to obtaining some clue to the living man, or, if dead, some proof of his death. My knowledge of the previous history of Madame de Mehul and her daughter was sufficient to supply all necessary evidence of their being indeed the persons sought for, and completely satisfied the Duke's mind. Shocked at the neAvs of his sister's"], [107, "101 VERONIA. decease\u2014 which reached me while in Paris, and which I instantly communicated to him \u2014 the old nobleman's impatience to behold his niece and repair in her person all his unkindness to her mother, induced him instantly to forward to De Boisvante intelligence of the discovery thus made, desiring him to present himself to Veronia, and escort her as soon as possible to her future home.

The Doctor's warm heart noted it with pain. \" Good night \u2014 have courage, Jacques,\" said he, as he wrung his friend's hand warmly ; \" it is only for life \u2014 think of that, and it will console you.\" And Avith this last unanswerable piece of consolation Van Helder withdrew."], [110, "104 CHAPTER VIII. \" All farewells should be sudden when for ever.\" Sardanapalus\u2014 Byron. \" Veronia, dear Veronia, it was the will of God.\" Strange, mysterious contradiction of the human heart, that makes the sceptic recognize at some moment the working of a principle he otherwise denies !

You stand upon its threshold, and cannot see from thence the vista of years opening before you. Can you look calmly forward, to shut all chance of happier things from them ?

The evils he described had not yet reached her, and it is hard for youth to accept, without proof, the results of the ex perience of age. \"And what of my cousin?\" asked she, hesitatingly, after a moment's pause, anxious to change the subject. \" Dear Veronia, it was of him I was about to speak.

The Admiral was as perfect a type of his usual stage representative as is often met with in real life. He had been a fine fel- Ioav once, doubtless, but there was very little resemblance to humanity now left in him. A patch covered one eye, one sleeve hung empty, he moved with difficulty, as if crippled by rheumatism, or the effects of battle \u2014 possibly from both combined \u2014 and when he spoke his voice sounded as if it came a long way off from the depths of some sepulchral cavern, which was probably not far from being the case, as he seemed hollow in the chest.

The case is surely much the same as that stated by Thackeray of one who, at his club, prefers the company of a \" lively, well-dressed, handsome, gentleman-like young man to that of a slouching, ill washed, misanthropic, murderer,\" and so of other things. George Elliot's \" old woman at her soli tary dinner,\" for example, may be a very interesting subject in the abstract, but in pure reality the spectator who dwells upon the scene to its close may have his delicacy somewhat Avounded by witnessing her transformation of her fork into a toothpick, &c.

Yet we cannot but think that, in common Avith a dash of \" picturesque, sentimental wretchedness,\" and a few other poetic in gredients, it gives a decidedly agreeable flavour to the dish of fiction.

Go ! \" The sudden passion in her eyes and gesture awed and startled him, he saw that it was useless to contend further, and slunk from the apartment. \"In tears! Veronia,\" cried Van Helder, on entering the room some moments later, after conducting De Boisvante to the gate, where he had Avondered at the latter's em barrassed air and countenance, though only a few words had passed between them. \"Your cousin tells me that you have declined going to Paris, and he has left in my hands this purse from his uncle, as he says he did not like offering it directly to you ; how is this, my child ; need there exist such reserve between cousins ?\" Veronia hesitated for a moment ere she replied \u2014 k2"], [138, "132 VERONIA. \" Dear, kind Doctor,\" said she, at length, Avith tearful frankness, \" ask me nothing ; at this moment my heart is full.

As to this journey to Paris, I have no courage just at present for so complete a change. Doubtless, my uncle's house is gay, his society brilliant \u2014 what should I do there Avith my mourning heart ? There will be time later to think of this ; at pre sent, solitude and my mother's memory, suffice to me \u2014 I will not put them away.

The homely land scape lay dim and sleeping, wrapped in grey hues, and hushed in the peace of coming night. Silence was over all ; that stillness which, when sad and weary, the heart welcomes as the only element in Avhich its fevered pulses may find rest. Not such, however, were the feelings with Avhich Veronia viewed the scene. To her tortured spirit, the silence and the stillness were but suggestive of deep woe. The dull agonies of a crushed love \u2014 the cruel scene of death and misery through Avhich she had so lately passed, stood now between her soul and the pure, holy in fluence of Nature's calm. Unobserved by all, she stole aAvay, leaving the quiet village behind her, and gained, as night was falhng, the lonely cottage which had witnessed her mother's end. There fell upon her ear the ocean's murmur; on its"], [140, "134 VERONIA. bosom trembled the moonlight \u2014 but, to her eyes, spread darkness, darkness everywhere. No hope, no morrow ; all had vanished, all was swept away \u2014 destroyed ; why should not she, too, sink into the gulf that had swallowed up so much ? Why should not she also cease to be, since all that she loved had passed aAvay? Could it be worse to die than to live thus? In the grave was there not silence, rest, oblivion? \"Oh! my God,\" murmured she, \" I thank thee that thou hast created death !\" Terrible thoughts, springing from the breast of youth, for she Avas young, though traces like those left by years of suffering sat upon her brow \u2014 tokens of a grief which the daAvning of another life alone could smooth away ! There had been an instant, during the late interview, when the anguish of her feelings had been transformed into a thought of crime ; a passionate thirst for revenge ; a Avish to trample into dust the felon heart that had so failed her; a sense of bitter shame at having loved so well and so un wisely ; and, finally, a still more humbling"], [141, "135 VERONIA. conviction that she loved yet, might possibly love on, through Avorse, perchance, than this, and that, from the bondage of this love, no human power could set her free. She seated herself beside the open case ment, and leaned her throbbing head upon her hands. Pitilessly, imperiously, Uke giant waves, one bitter memory after another came flooding through the chambers of her brain, until, overwhelmed by their violence, the frightened, struggling soul sank unresist ingly, borne onwards by the fury of a great, a desperate temptation. To escape \u2014 to fly from life, from decep tion, and from pain, even through the dark portals of death itself. \" But,\" Avhispered reason, \"could even the grave quench the terrible, the burning life then hurrying so fiercely through her being? What though it should prove only a stepping-stone to something more dread and awful still \u2014 the very presence of the Eternal One !\" There was a horrible sense of exultation to her half-maddened spirit in the thought of defying Heaven itself, by plunging un-"], [142, "136 VERONIA. summoned into the abyss, and casting back to the Creator the gift of mortal life, and \u2014 oh ! inconsistency of woman's heart \u2014 though she disdained him, there was com fort in the hope of bringing remorse to the traitor, and dying to prove to him the im mensity of his crime. What, then, should stay the deed ? A sudden thrill, a strange revulsion, that made the hot blood creep and curdle in her veins ; an aAvful recollec tion of how an unhalloAved death had once been met within those very walls. Clear, distinct, and terrible, the scene rose up before her. Twilight, as we have said, had passed aAvay ; the moon had risen, and streamed now brightly through the casement and over the stone floor, as it had done upon that memorable night. Again Veronia saw that stiffened form, that agonized face, upturned in the stern agony of lonely conflict with the destroyer, the red stream congealing on the parted lips, the stony eyes and convulsed hands \u2014 real and vivid, as though painted freshly from the dreadful past ; and shrinking back appalled,"], [143, "137 VERONIA. the desperate vision of the previous mo ment feU shattered before this ghastlier image. \" Mother ! 0 mother ! \" was the cry that rose from the daughter's heart.

Had she ever dreamt of hap piness in a world which had proved so fatal to this beloved one ? Had those ties of ten der affection, that awful separation \u2014 soft ened by no farewell, cheered by no hope of re-union \u2014 been all so soon forgotten ? Alas ! it was so ! Yet, if it be true that the probation of many a fond and earth stained soul may be to linger near the spot of past transgressions, to watch with sor roAving eyes the faults and sufferings of the loved, perhaps her mother's spirit hovered near Veronia at that hour, shielded her by its unseen presence from some subtle poAver of iU, and struck within her breast on some still deeper chord than that which had just vibrated beneath the stormy touch of pas sion."], [144, "138 CHAPTER XI. \"The very best thing for you, my dear client, that could have happened.

At the Duke's age that is all that the most sanguine could expect, and, in point of fact, his life is not worth even that purchase.\" \" One year, or ten, what is the difference to me ? \" replied the provoked nephew; \"in my position it is much the same thing. I'U tell you what, Monsieur Bouchard, it seems to me pretty clear that a pair of pistols is the only way of settling my affairs. I'm tired of this sort of thing ; \" and he laughed bitterly. Again the lawyer's glance rested com placently upon his client's countenance. He withdrew it quickly, however, and was"], [147, "141 VERONIA. silent for a few seconds ; Avhen he next spoke it was discreetly cast down. \" That your case is vexatious, monsieur, I avUI not deny, but it is far from being an uncommon one, and most men would begin by trying some less desperate remedy than the one you propose ; let us say marriage, for example \u2014 a wife with money \u2014 Avouldn't that be preferable ?\" \" With money, doubtless ; but where is such a person to be found?

It passed, however, and the latter repUed quietly, \"Just so \u2014 just so; you have a right, with such a name, to look for an equiva lent ; now excuse my saying that, under the circumstances, I think that equivalent to be money.

Monsieur Bouchard was getting confused, a glance at his cUent recalled him. Horri fied astonishment sat upon the young man's features; had he rightly understood what had just passed ? Was this ghoul offered to him as the solution of his difficulties? Could that superior poAver, whose anger conscience told him he had so well merited, have reserved for him so hideous a punish ment as this?

Fearful of his return, and a reneAval of the subject, De Boisvante hurried aAvay also. He threw himself into a chair on reaching his own chamber, bewildered with horror and surprise. Suddenly he started up and locked his door, for the terror of Justine was on him, and in the confusion of his ideas he felt scarcely safe from her even there; then, stepping to the large mirror at the toilet table, he lent over it, and contemplated his OAvn image much as a disconsolate woman might have done. \" By the limbs of Apollo,\" said he, softly to himself, as he passed his Avaxen hand through the locks Avhich rested on his temples, and looked compassionately at himself, \"was anything so preposterous ever conceived ? Death ! why I never"], [151, "VERONIA. 145 seriously thought of such a thing before ; but it Avould be nothing to this !\" and then his thoughts reverted to Paris ; he thought of entering its salons with Justine on his arm, and in the horror of that thought Veronia was avenged. Yet what to do ; how to escape from Bouchard, without exposing himself to that gentleman's iU-Avill, he knew not. A thought struck him \u2014 he took pen and paper and commenced : \u2014 \" My dear, kind Herminie, \"As the most energetic, and at the same time the dearest person to me on earth,\" \u2014 ' strong-minded Avoman ! but she will easily beUeve that,' Avas his mental observation on the Avords, \u2014 \" I have recourse to you in the most difficult moment of my life.

Greatly desirous of having lineage, he contracted a union Avith the virtuous, and amiable daughter of Mon seigneur the Duke of Bugundy. But, as the proverb says, ' though man proposes, God disposes,' and it proA7ed so in this case, for, Duke Hubert having married for the sake of offspring, neither alms, prayers, nor pilgrimages seemed at all to bring about the fulfilment of his Avishes. So great was his disappointment, that at last he could not refrain from complaining openly of the cruelty of Heaven toAvards his duchess. \" Shortly after this he one day departed for the chase, highly incensed, and saying to himself, ' I see numbers of parents Avith * History of Robert the Devil, from the \" Chronicles of Flanders.\""], [199, "VERONIA. 193 beautiful children, in whom they take de light, Avhile I have none ; I feel certain noAv that God hates me.

His very first action was that of stabbing the poor monk employed to teach him his catechism, and soon all Normandy, his parents in cluded, trembled at his very name. \" Surprised at length, at the extent of his OAvn AAickedness, Robert one day sought his mother, and asked her if she could in form him Avhat might be the probable cause of his remarkable perversity. Struck by remorse, the Duchess then confessed to him the secret of her criminal voav, and on hearing this her son became touched so far by grace as to declare then and there that he would renounce Satan and all his Avorks and make a pilgrimage, to Rome, for the purpose of confessing all his sins. His first step on the road to amendment Avas rather, hoAvever, in the style of his former adven tures, but that, perhaps, Avas the natural consequence of having never learnt his catechism, and, therefore, of not knowing exactly how a Christian should behave under similar circumstances.

Through these portals all who entered passed into stone cloisters, running round a quadrangle in their centre, Avhich had once served as the burying ground of monks, inhabiting the building as a monastery some time during the last century, and where the rank grass still Avaved mournfuUy over their long chilled ashes beneath. The deep vault overhead, the flagged pavement, where each passing footstep resounded in a"], [207, "201 VERONIA. ghostly mariner, and the long perspective which they offered to the sight, added to the death-like chill which ever rested in them, all these circumstances combined would have made intruders from the out ward world feel as though life and all its softening influences had closed upon them with the stone door beyond. And thus, indeed, had Veronia felt until many a weary day had passed aAvay. The retreat she now occupied, though not exactly of his choosing, had obtained the sanction of Van Helder, anxious at least to deter her from the desperate project of returning to inhabit once more and alone the dismal cottage which had been already the scene of so much tribulation to her ; a project Avhich she had cherished Avith the obstinacy of the unhappy, and to which, in the eyes of the Doctor, all else seemed pre ferable. To place her in another scene \u2014 to sur round her with the watchful care and pity of her own sex, as AveU as the protection of their presence, appeared to him not less an imperious duty to herself than to her newly-"], [208, "202 VERONIA. discovered relative and natural guardian, for, although the eccentric principle in his nature made Van Helder perfectly compre hend her evident reluctance to assume the Avorld's harness once more, yet, what little prudence he possessed suggested to him that it would be desirable to keep the door open for any possible change of feeling on her part. Under this state of things, the Curb's suggestion of such a retreat had been re ceived by him with approval, and welcomed by Veronia as the next best thing to that grave in which she longed so feverishly to bury all her life's woes. Thus had she become an inmate of the Convent of Septuagesima, As in the physical, so in the moral world, each constitution requires a remedy peculiar to itself, and thus it is that so much difference of opinion exists as to the efficacy of solitude as a healer of the soul's ill.

Madame de Mont Brison gaily dismissed the theme. Half an hour later, a blaze of light, an atmosphere of perfume, and the sound of soft laughter and gay voices pervaded the draAA7ing-room of the lovely widow. Al though the mourning for her guardian's sister, in which she was so involuntarily plunged, had obliged her in decency to re frain from the scenes of the great Avorld, and to close her doors to its brilliant assem blies, yet, in accordance Avith continental habits, she still continued the familiar habit of receiving friendly visits each evening without ceremony.

At the corner of Madame de Mont Bri son's couch stood a man, the incongruities of whose aspect, Avhich yet strangely har monized in the original, must make any description of him seem Uke caricature. He was small and very symmetrically formed, the extreme delicacy of both hands and feet shoAving in a marked manner, as associated Avith his other characteristics, an aristocratic origin, Avhich the admirable grace of his attitude and unapproachable dignity of mien corroborated. All these advan tages, however, were counterpoised by the disproportionate size of his head, Avhich, grand, massive, and severe, would have suited well the fullest proportions of the human figure. The features were large, deeply cut, and irregular, and there Avas something in their very calm suggestive of uncommon powers.

A close observer would have read the title of \" poet \" imprinted on his large broAv, and confirmed by the bloodless cheek and the compressed lip, too sensitive to veil its secrets \u2014 like those of other men \u2014 beneath a smile. To be brief, he was plainly dressed, and in the AA7ay of fashion only distinguished from the other persons present by his shavren face and hair Avorn a thought longer than the rest. He had been listening quietly to the gay nothings which formed the material of con versation in every circle of which Herminie chanced to be the centre ; but though no scorn of them appeared upon his features it was evident he cared not to enter into the melee. \" You take no part in our argument, Monsieur le Comte,\" said Herminie, turning suddenly to him for the first time since he had stood so silently beside her, and glanc ing at him as she spoke, Avith a wonderful coquetry, so skilfully managed as to be invisible eA7en to the keen eyes that sur- Q2"], [234, "228 VERONIA. rounded her, and yet conveyed to the person to whom it Avas addressed. \" Which of us do you think is in the right ? \" \" Pardon me, madame, but \u2014 the subject \u2014 I am not aware.\" \" How, monsieur, is it possible that so much eloquence has fallen unheeded on your ear ?

That neither of these circum stances very favourably impressed the countryman, although involuntarily creat ing a change in his views\u2014 for his class are proverbially suspicious of strangers \u2014 was evident from the tone in which he replied, and the manner of his address. \" Monsieur is not then aware of the distance to M .

If you like the company of Avitches and devils, I do not.\" And waiting for no reply, as though the argument were conclusive, the rustic proceeded on his way. The sickly gleam of moonlight had vanished, the Avind was rising higher, and the rain commencing to fall more heavily still, as sloAAdy and painfully the stranger felt his hopeless way towards a gate he had remarked in the direction of the light, He pressed against it, but it did not yield ; he passed an anxious hand across it, and a massive padlock met his touch. To clamber over it was the only resource left, and despite his intolerable pain, the determina tion to succeed enabled him to accomplish so much.

The light, at moments totally obscured, apparently by these obstructions, at length shone clear and steadily, though slender in its dimensions, and seemed, to his surprise, to proceed from lower ground than that he stood on. The stranger at last reached it, lost it again in struggling through a fresh collec tion of bushes, and finally struck against a stone balustrade belonging to the dAvelling CO Ci from Avhence the rays proceeded. FolloAving this balustrade until he came to an opening, the traveller soon penetrated to a flight of steps, down which he had nearly fallen before he Avas fully aware of their proximity.

Open, open ! Whoever you are, you shall be paid for it.\" A muffled shriek ansAvered the appeal ; then the sound of a shrill, cracked voice, pouring out a flood of adj urations in a tone which savoured of the peculiar dialect of the country, in the midst of which the traveller distinguished only the Avords, \" Vade retro, Satanas,\" piteously uttered."], [256, "250 VERONIA. The peculiar ghastliness of the Avail chilled the listener, but the last words re assured him. Coupled Avith the rustic's parting words, he gleaned at once the sex and superstitious notions of the inhabitant of the dwelling. The time had been when, Avandering in youth in these fair valleys, those names of Avitch or wizard would haA7e stirred his heart's pulses with something very like belief; but dreams like these had long since vanished, Avith all childish things, even from the traveller's memory, swept thence by the realities of a hard life and its harder struggles, and but for the pain he Avas enduring, and which aug mented every moment, he would have smiled at the bare idea. The \" vade retro, Satanas,\" too, was so little in character Avith the reputation of a professed witch, as completely to exonerate the speaker from such a charge ; but it proved sufficiently a lonely woman's terrors and feeble mind. Menaces then, as the traveller's sagacity at once divined, were the most unlikely means of gaining admission to her doors, and"], [257, "251 VERONIA. he commenced immediatelyasoothing appeal to her charity on his behalf, explanatory at the same time of his unfortunate position. But all was useless. In the same cruel silence as before the slender light within burnt on, Avhile the Avind and rain without chilled the wretched suppliant asheleant,sick and agonized, against the inhospitable Avails. \" My God, my God ! hoAV inhuman ! \" burst at length in accents of indignant suffering from his lips, amid groans, to which even the bravest man yields when his pride is saved by solitude in which to in dulge them ; and covering his face Avith his hands, he was about to sink, half fainting, to the earth, exhausted as he was by the torturing exertion he had sustained for so long a period, Avhen a sound near made him look up again in hope. The door had creaked upon its hinges, it was sloAvly opened, and the traveller heard a feeble step upon the threshold. There dwelt, then, something like pity in that desolate mansion \u2014 Avoman or witch, her heart at length Avas softened \u2014 and with a last effort he drew near."], [258, "252 VERONIA. \" Good mother,\" said he, soothingly and softly, to the figure he dimly espied now looking forth, \"have compassion, and suffer me only to rest upon the floor of your dAvelling until morning. I am in grievous pain, and faint AAith struggling to your door.\" \"And why are ye abroad at such an hour ? What evil spirit drove ye here ? Better to have lain doAvn in the valley and slept there in the darkness, than ventured to thip threshold,\" ansAvered the dreary voice Avhich he had heard before. The words of the rustic, which these seemed to corroborate, occurred to the listener, and a shiver, Avhich his reason re pelled, but could not repress, shook his now drenched and tired frame. He felt dis mayed, but would not yield to the coward feeling, and spoke again. \"Nay, my good mother,\" said he, still more gently, \" see you not hoAv stormy is the night? I fear not to sleep upon the earth, God knoAvs, butnoAv it is drenched through ; besides, I have met with a severe hurt, and am quite a stranger in these parts. You will not repulse me, surely ?\""], [259, "253 VERONIA. \" A stranger ! \" echoed the Avoman, catch ing hastily at the Avords. \" God forgive me for it, but I will let you enter; yet you must. swear by all your hopes of heaven that no one shall ever learn from your lips that you have done so, else it is over my miserable body only that you shall cross this thres hold. Do you hear me ?\" \" 'Tis a strange condition,\" said the startled traveller, pausing, \" and without Avishing to offend you, I should like to knoAv the motive that dictates it ; anything in reason I Avould certainly not object to, but \" \"Enough, you refuse it; go! \" and the decrepit figure dreAV back with a gesture of defiance. \" Stay ! a word ! \" said the stranger. \" If I am called on to witness any lawless deeds, to take a part in any dire secret, I refuse indeed, but if the condition named is honestly the only one, I consent. Are you alone here?\" \" Yes.\" \" Then, good mother, none shall ever know you gave me hospitaUty \u2014 on"], [260, "254 VERONIA. the word of an honest man, I swear it.\" She drew back silently to let him enter, and as he did so, secured with many a bolt and bar the door behind them, then bent her feeble steps towards where the light was burning. The traveller followed, and together they entered a stone-floored kitchen of immense dimensions, on whose vast hearth smouldered a feAv Avood ashes. A table in the centre, a Avooden stool, a pile of logs in one corner, and a miserable pallet-bed in another, were all the comforts which it contained ; and ill and weary as was the guest, a sense of the utter Avretchedness of the place chilled and repulsed him. He turned to look at his hostess, and her aspect completed his dis- gust. Gaunt, withered, and fantastic in her ugliness, there remained so little resem blance to Avomanhood about her, that it might AveU have been doubted Avhether she ready belonged to the softer sex or no. On her head was wound the many-coloured kerchief which forms the usual head-dress of her countrywomen, from beneath which"], [261, "VERONIA. 255 strayed wild, grey, scanty tresses, Avhose disorder heightened the desolate character of her worn, dilapidated features and sunken yet gleaming eyes. The glance which issued from beneath their withered lids had in it something so strange and restless, so full at once of fear and craft, and vacancy, all strangely mingled, that the stranger's blood ran cold as it met his. A shiver, then a deadly faintness, seized him, as staggering toAvards the earth he sank, insensible of all around. When he recovered, a pillow from the miserable bed was crammed beneath his head ; his broAV was Avet, as though it had been bathed with Avater, the knapsack un strapped lay beside him, and the wild figure was bending over him in the attitude of a frightened child. The instant necessary to afford him these details restored to the traveller his powers of speech and move ment ; he sat up, and drank the cup of Avater which his strange companion offered him, before retreating to the vacant stool opposite, Avhere she sat down, and contem plated him in the same scared manner as before."], [262, "256 VERONIA. \"Excuse the trouble I have given you, good mother,\" were his first words, faintly uttered ; \" another draught of water is all I shall require more. The foot Avhich I have sprained avUI perhaps ache less Avhen I have bathed it,\" and stooping, he removed all covering from the injured limb, Avhich appeared less swollen and inflamed exter nally, than from the pain it had caused him he could have supposed possible. \"Ha!\" exclaimed the crone, roused to apparent interest as it met her view, and creeping once more to his side, \" 'tis no flesh Avound, I see, that would be easier to heal; but this may be managed also, if you will.\" \" Indeed, good mother, I should be grate ful beyond thanks if you could alleviate at least the pain sufficiently for me to crawl aAvay to-morroAv toAvards any spot Avhere I might meet a conveyance ; to think of using the limb comfortably for some Avhile yet is hopeless. I do not expect it ; a sprain is a thing of time.\" \" Maybe ; but you shall walk aAA7ay from hence before to-morroAv's morn ; stretch out"], [263, "257 VERONIA. your foot now, and move not in the least.\" Taking the first part of her sentence for a discourteous threat, yet silenced, as well by his own fatigue, as something Aveird-like in her manner, the guest obeyed, and suffering her \u2014 but not with the pleasantest feelings \u2014 to spread her lean broAvn fingers on the limb, he patiently awaited her next demon strations. After letting them remain clasped tightly over the region of the ankle-bone some minutes, she commenced a series of gentle stroking movements, all in one direc tion, down the limb, following, as it seemed, the course of the strained nerves and muscles along it ; and gradually, at the expiration of about a quarter of an hour, to his surprise, the patient began to experience a soothing diminution of the aching sensation Avhich characterises a hurt of this nature. The throbbing of the arteries subsided, the fever of the skin gave place to a refreshing coolness, and suddenly all pain Avas gone. \" Oh ! my good mother,\" exclaimed he, in astonished gladness, \" you have cured me of the pain entirely \u2014 only the Aveakness now remains ; but Avith a Aveek or two of vol.

These were characterised by a more decided pressure, increasing in force and rapidity, and still directed towards the same region, until a sudden tAvinge, which they occasioned him, caused the patient to cry out, and draw his foot suddenly aAvay ; at the same moment the sorceress \u2014 as he began noAV really to think her \u2014 threw her self backAvards, with hands uplifted in an attitude of fantastic triumph, and, through a sort of low and bubbling laughter, which thrilled through the excited nerves of the traveller, he caught the words, \" You can Avalk noAv ; if you are grateful, go.\""], [265, "259 CHAPTER XVIII. THE BOUCHARDS. \" Well, if that client of yours Avith a ' de ' before his name really has any intention of coming back to ask our Justine in marriage, all I can say is, he's a long time about it ; it's seven weeks to-day since he left,\" was Madame Bouchard's observation, uttered in far from dulcet tones, one morning as her husband was preparing to descend into his office. \" My dear,\" was the rejoinder of the latter, \" you should never prejudice a case by passing a premature judgment upon it ; the least said until a thing is settled, the better, believe me.\" s2"], [266, "260 VERONIA. \" Premature ! why, there has been time enough to settle I don't know how many cases, and make up ten marriages, at least, in the time he has been thinking of it ; I never heard of such proud nonsense, never, and I AA7onder at you, Mr. Bouchard, putting up Avith it. I didn't think before that you were the man to eat humble pie in that way.\" \" No more I am, my dear, unless there is something to be got by it,\" answered he, soothingly, \" but you forget that the case is not an ordinary one at all. There is some little difficulty, as you must admit, in getting Justine off; and if, besides achieving this, we can get her a noble husband, it is surely worth the exercise of a little patience mean while.\" \" A little patience ! yes, if that was all ; but everything so uncertain, the young man never paying Justine the least attention that I could see or hear of while he was here, and neither you nor she ever seeming to know AA7hen he is coming back ; it is pro voking and disagreeable, and I tell you frankly, Mr. Bouchard, it's my opinion"], [267, "261 VERONIA. you've spoilt the affair altogether. If I had been aUoAA7ed to manage it, she would have been married by this time, and perhaps the Duke himself here on a visit to us.\" \" Tut, tut, ta ! Avhat imaginations you women have ! \" ejaculated the husband, crossly. \" You try, my dear, and pay a little more attention to Justine's toilet \u2014 that's your business. I don't believe the poor girl has got anything to put on but that speckled bed-gOAvn she goes about in, if Monsieur de Boisvante should arrive to-morroAv.\" \" Not got anything to wear, Monsieur Bouchard !\" retorted his spouse, angrily, \" Avhy, hasn't she got that blue and pink poplin she wore the very first day he ever dined here, and the grey moire her grand mother gave her on her birthday, and the felloAv silk to mine that you bought her at the new year, and the green satinette I had made for the last assembly, and \u2014 and a host of others that she never avUI put on, thanks to you, keeping her cooped up in that office Avith all those laAv papers, until she hasn't any senses left?

It's enough to turn her into a perfect griffin, and it's my belief it will ;\" and thus saying, the out raged lady bustled away. Left alone, the bawyer's reflections fell upon the very theme from whence had arisen this discussion. True, it was strange \u2014 though, of course, it would not do to admit it to his wife \u2014 that his project seemed to have fallen so completely to the ground, and that the bait so cunningly contrived, should not have met Avith better success. Had he been understood, was his offer disdained, did De Boisvante hope to find some other issue from his perilous position ? These were the questions Avhich vexingly obtruded on Bouchard's mind. The entrance of his daughter disturbed the train of his reflections. \" You are wanted in the office,\" said she, curtly \u2014 \" business I can't manage \u2014 person Avaiting ;\" and she turned to go. \" You might as AveU say Avho it is,\" re torted Bouchard, irately chafed, as he already was, by his OAvn perplexities; \"you knoAv as"], [269, "VERONIA. 263 AveU as I do, Justine, it puts me at a disad vantage to come plump doAvn upon a person I don't expect, and to Avhom, perhaps, I don't know Avhat to say.

I avUI descend directly,\" and Justine with dreAv. Madame Crapaud was one of those per sons of Avhom there generally exists one, at least, in most famiUes, either introduced into it by some inopportune marriage, or foisted on it by circumstances Avhich no one could either foresee or prevent. She Avas, in fact, the inevitable poor relation,"], [270, "264 VERONIA. Avho serves as a blister to the family pride \u2014 a type too well known to all to need any description from us.

She had long held the situation of confi dential femme de charge \u2014 a position betAveen that of companion and servant \u2014 to a wealthy lady in Paris, and having accumu lated a little money in this capacity, had prudently invested it in her own country. It was as a medium for the transaction of business of this nature, that, on her annual visits to Bruges, she commonly sought the lawyer, to whom she was also distantly re lated. \" Ah ! well, Cousin Crapaud, glad to see you, I am sure \u2014 hope you are well,\" said Bouchard, entering his office in a glow of apparent geniality and good temper, and rubbing his stout hands, as AA7as his habit when he had an object in view. \" Sit doAvn, and make yourself comfortable; it is an age since we have seen you, and I really began to wonder Avhere you were.\""], [271, "VERONIA. 265 The object of this speech had risen as he entered, and, Avith a furtive smile, she Avatched him choose his own seat, ere she cringingly resumed her own. Confident as he was, there was about this Avoman something which evidently tested the self-possession of the laAvyer, for his bold black eye shelved off from her sidelong glance uneasily, as though shrinking before the occult penetration which its humility seemed striving to disclaim. There are signs and symtoms of Avhich Lavater, Gall, Spurtzheim, and later AA'riters again have taken note, as indications of moral baseness, and the person of this woman com bined them all. The narroAv, holloAV brow, the changeful eye, the pale, mean lip and pointed bony chin, the sallow freckled cheek and wasted throat, the knotted fingers of the lank ple beian hand \u2014 these, all these, were less eloquent against her than the silent language of that dastard line, that curve of the thin figure, as, amid the noonday sunshine, its felon shadoAv was cast upon the Avail. \"Thank you kindly, Cousin Bouchard,\""], [272, "266 VERONIA. said Madame Crapaud, in an uncertain voice, and with a short metallic laugh of so decidedly un exhilarating a nature as to make Bouchard shift uneasily upon his chair, while answering it by a spasmodic smile. \"Thank you kindly, I know you are sincere, though I am only a poor rela tion ; but 1 am grateful, you know that.\" \" Oh ! yes, yes, of course ; that is to say, there is no need of gratitude at all \u2014 ahvays glad to see you, and be of any ser vice, I am sure ; \" and Bouchard rubbed his hands more energetically than before. \" I transacted my little shred of business before you came in Avith Monsieur Van brest, and handed him the money for invest ment, as usual, but I am to get the receipt from you.\" \" To be sure \u2014 quite correct,\" ansAvered the laAvyer, hastening, Avith an air of relief, to busy himself in preparing the required document, and so sequestrating himself from the full influence of his visitor's unpleasant glance. \" You are a prudent Avoman, Madame Crapaud, and may aspire to a bon parti some day.\""], [273, "VERONIA. 267 \"He, he, he!\" laughed she again; \"Avhat an idea, my cousin \u2014 you are joking.\" \"Not at all,\" replied the latter, deliber ately, \" and I am only surprised you have never thought of marriage yet ; but you are right, perhaps, and might change your position for the Avorse.\" \"Ah! indeed\" \u2014 Madame Crapaud raised her eyes to Heaven as she spoke, \u2014 \" never Avas an unworthy servant so favoured as I am ; my lady's goodness, ah ! my cousin, it passes language ; \" and she sighed. \" Delightful character ! \" said Bouchard, blandly. \" Who is her laAAyer ? \" \"A charming character, indeed,\" replied she, not noticing the question; \" and it is not only I who say so ; you should hear the ec clesiastics of St. Sulpice speak of her, and even Monseigneur himself; she is the soul of the parish in good works, munificence, and piety \u2014 an example, even in our Quartier, and you know how much that expresses. I am too umvorthy of serving her, but I am aware of my unAvorthiness fully;\" and Avith an air of deep humility she cast down her eyes. \" Oh ! dear, no, I am sure you are not,\""], [274, "268 VERONIA. ejaculated Bouchard, coughing uneasily ; \" you underrate yourself; a confidential companion, such as yourself, Madame Cra paud, is above all value, particularly to a wealthy person like your lady, and in a place like Paris ; but being so devout, your pa troness does not mingle much Avith the world, I suppose ? \" \" For the sake of the Avorld she does,\" Avas the reply ; \" so much virtue could not be hidden in retirement without doing an injury to the interests of society. For the sake of giving good example she visits, therefore, a great deal, and receives all the most select company in Paris.\" \" Indeed ! \" said Bouchard, carelessly, and looking involuntarily away, that the speaker might not remark the sudden gleam Avhich he felt rising to his eyes. \" You may happen then to have seen at her house a nobleman, Avhom I have heard mentioned as one of the most venerable characters there \u2014 quite a saint, I believe \u2014 the Duke de Rochefierre.\" \" A saint indeed ! but I have not had the honour of seeing him, as he never visits,"], [275, "269 VERONIA. though he receives a good deal, and my lady frequently goes to his receptions ; in fact, his ward and nearest kinswoman is one of her greatest friends.\" \"Ah! any relation, I wonder, to his nephew Monsieur de Boisvante^ a charming young gentleman whom I have the honour of knowing.\" \" Exactly, his cousin ; they generally visit my lady together.

Bouchard's cheek actually blanched with surprise and eager-"], [276, "270 VERONIA. ness. It was imperative that he should know more ; but how to do so Avithout be traying to his visitor the secret of his motives perplexed him. Her cunning eye watched him narrowly for an instant, and then she rose as if to take her leave. \" Stay, stay, my cousin,\" exclaimed the lawyer, rising also hurriedly to prevent her from going. \" You must not go yet ; you have taken no refreshment ; besides, you know it is so seldom that we poor citizens get a glimpse at high life, that you mustn't Avonder if we are interested, and even a little curious about it. We have, it is true, occasionally, a chance of seeing how these things are managed when there is a mar riage contractdrawn up, but otherwise itis all romance to us, and it is really very amusing sometimes to hear a little harmless gossip of the kind, so don't be frightened my dear, cousin ; I will not betray your confidence,\" and he laughed nervously. \" Oh ! Cousin Bouchard, your honour able profession is always a guarantee of that; but really now Avhat do you want to know?

There AA7as but one means of being even with such an opponent ; that one, hoAvever distasteful and unusual a policy, Avas frank ness. Like many another rascal he was not wholly ungifted Avith the poAver of assuming it. \" Well, the case is so far interesting,\" said he, \"that I am, as I before said, acquainted Avith the gentleman, and know something of his affairs ; it is ahvays amusing, you knoAv, to speculate on whether the marriage of a person we know is one of interest, reason, or incUnation.\" \" I thought, perhaps, your interests were involved in the question, in which case I should have made it a duty to be of any use to you, but for mere gossip sake \u2014 now really you are too conscientious to expect it.' The bait was too cunningly devised to fail in its effect. Bouchard knew hoAv well his thoughts had been divined, and hesitated no longer to avow them. \" Sit doAvn a moment, my dear cousin,"], [278, "272 VERONIA. and let us ha\\7e a little conversation,\" said he, therefore. \" You have so much know ledge of the A\\7orld, that I feel I can say to you what I could say to few besides.

The Duke's house and my lady's are a great resource to her, I can assure you.\" \" Poor young man ! \" sighed the sympa-"], [279, "273 VERONIA. thetic Bouchard, \" he seems indeed destined to be a victim to some person of the sort. I myself have been the means of saving him from a similar plot in this country \u2014 it is really a pity ! \" \" Well,\" ansAvered Madame Crapaud, \" I don't know; the lady is clever and poor, and he has money, and no head. The fools must pay for the clever ones in this world, you know, my cousin,\" added she, with a laugh. \" True, true ! \" answered Bouchard, who, in his capacity of lawyer, perfectly appreci ated this sentiment. \" True, true ! \" and hoAv the conversation might have ended, but for the arrival at this juncture of other clients, whose reception could not be postponed, it is impossible to conjecture.

The coffee, too, is boiling, so I hope you will enjoy it ; but there is our refectory bell, so I must hurry off ; I Avish you a good appetite, Fraulein, and don't let it all get cold, I beseech you.\" \" Thanks, sister,\" said Veronia, languidly, as the little nun bustled away, and then, without looking at the table, she continued her uneasy Avalk up and down, to and fro, while signs of anguish rose each moment from her heart. \" Reverend mother,\" said Sister Martina, as she entered the refectory Avhere the com munity Avere assembled for their evening collation, \"mayl speaktoyou, if youplease?\" \" Speak, my daughter, I listen,\" answered the superioress. \"Well, then, dear reverend mother, the Fraulein Veronia excites my compassion to day ; she has been since morning so dejected, it is pitiful to see her.

Veronia was in that mood Avhen all and everything AA7hich can distract us from our own thoughts seems welcome, and she listened accordingly more favourably than the nun had quite expected to the proposal. \" You will feel being woke up, Fraulein, so I shall leave some coffee by the fire, and look to it the last thing, so that when 1 come to fetch you there may be a Avarm drink ready,\" said the kind creature. \" You are A7ery good, sister,\" said Veronia, with a melancholy smile ; \"but there is no fear that I shall sleep before midnight ; such an event, at least, would be a novelty.\" \" Ah ! poor young lady, you have cause for sorrow, I knoAv ; but lay all at the feet of Jesus, and he will help you to bear it. Noav our office is going to begin, so I must go. You are quite sure you wish me to come for you, otherwise our good mother would not permit it.\" \" I really wish it, sister, though only from motives of curiosity, I confess. It AviU be"], [290, "284 VERONIA. the first time I shall have been present at a mass, and I suppose it will be celebrated with some extra ceremonies to-night.\" \" Oh ! yes, Fraulein,\" ansAvered the sister, Avith an amusingly important air, \" our chapel is decorated finely, and the townspeople will be admitted. Besides this, we shall have our best music ; but there is the bell, so I must leave you ; good-bye, Fraulein , pray try to sleep a little if you can.\" \" While S\u0153ur Martina, aU joyous as a child at the success of her man\u0153uvres, hur ried away to join her sisterhood in their vigil, Veronia, for a moment cheated of her sadness by witnessing her attendant's evi dent delight, had seated herself before the solitary fire to beguile the hours of watching as best she might. \" Poor little simple soul !\" thought she, \" this scheme to catch an umvary Protestant was probably suggested to her by some cun ning priest.

Religious enthusiasm had ever been to her a sentiment unknown, for the distinctive feature of her father's creed was Rationalism, pure and unredeemed, while of her mother's faith, until that last dread scene in which it was revealed, Veronia had known little beyond the fact that it was something not many degrees warmer than the fashionable indif ference of all the Avorld. Still, together with both parents, she had regularly each Sunday attended a Protestant chapel, where peculiar antagonism to all forms of enthusiastic faith had seemed the chief element of the doctrine proclaimed. \" Whatever is furthest removed from the absurdities of Romanism is the best,\" had her father often repeated in her hearing, and without examination she had very naturally imbibed the notion, and yielded unquestion ing adhesion to the same principle.

On this night, so great an anniversary throughout the Christian Avorld, Avhere, again inquired her heart, Avere those she had so loved ? Her parents ! did they rest AveU in their graves of sorroAV ? had their spirits found a haven ? Avere they at last at rest, or were they still mourning over the lost things of earth, like those lamenting voices Avhich, borne upon the night Avind, seemed sweeping past ? \" God grant it !\" Avas her fervent aspiration ; \"if, in the universe, there is indeed a place of happiness, may their dear spirits there have met once more,\" and the prayer led her thoughts back to her own lost heaven, a man's uncertain love ! Her Heaven ! Yes, such too truly it had been. She had Avished, she had hoped for no other, and she had awoke to find it the phantom of an overheated brain, whose"], [293, "VERONIA. 287 recollection filled her with shame. Bitter, bitter, was the memory, it would haunt her to eternity. Ah ! but to have loved some one Avorthy, true, and good, and to have been parted from him by the sharp hand of death, would have been joy compared to the pangs she had endured. For oh ! had she not lost the freshness of her heart, the best half of its faith, perhaps even its gentle ness, for ever. She thought of her dreary hours in the sea-shore hut, and felt Iioav each had carved itself upon her very life. She saAV noAv too with agony how even the sorrows of her wretched mother had been almost over looked by her in the contemplation of her own selfish woes, and she sorrowed at the recollection as they only sorrow to Avhom no remedy is left. Another, too, poor Henricart, the humble worshipper at her shrine, how bitterly she had reproved him when he too needed rather the generous pity of a true woman's heart.

It Avas a large building, larger even than many a village church, and on entering, Veronia perceived a numerous assemblage of strangers gathered in the main body of the edifice. She found herself, together with the sister hood, in a gallery overhanging it, and se cured from the intrusive gaze of those below by a close grating or screen, before Avhich her seat AAras placed. A number of stalls \u2014 richly ornamented Avith the antique wooden carving so abundant in Flanders \u2014 ran round the enclosure, in which, as she entered, the nuns Avere already assembled with their superior at their head, and her conductress"], [295, "289 VERONIA. now left her to faU into her own place among them. A rapid glance around showed Veronia that they were in the full habit of their order, and her eye would have rested yet awhile on their subdued and passionless aspect, but that the sound of music from beloAv attracted her attention, and an nounced that the service was on the point of commencing. She marked the altar, blazing with lights and bright with foliage, the clergy and their attendant acolytes, grouping themselves for the coming mass ; and now at the first tinkle of the little bell, which is its precursor, a hush of reverential silence, an air of deeper gravity, fell upon the assembled people. Curiously and coldly, as one set apart from their faith and its exercise, did Veronia survey the scene and notice the different novel features which it presented to her. Pressed round the altar steps and cling ing to its railings came first the very meanest of the crowd. The poor, the old, the sick, the crippled, blind, and helpless, seemed to have claimed this ground as their VOL.

Further on knelt many a homely but self-possessed child of the people, in calm and devout attention to the scene, Avhile the centre seats Avere filled by a motley multitude of rich and poor alike, and behind these again stood silent, grave, and attentive the most numerous male portion of them all, work man and gentleman, servant and master, side by side. The plaintive accents of the Kyrie Eleison, the triumphant tones of the Gloria in Excelsis, had died away, the Gospel had been delivered with its attendant solemnities, and the senses of Veronia had remained undazzled, her heart untouched, by all their influence. She had watched them Avith the same indifferent eyes Avith Avhich she might have regarded some opera pomp, as careless as to what might be their meaning, Avhen again the priestly group closed round the altar steps. \" Credo in unum Deum,\" chanted a solo voice, and the music took up the strain. Loud and"], [297, "291 VERONIA. triumphant rose the measure, till, at a point, it sank, it softened to the tenderness of in finite homage, to the plaintive ecstasy of adoration ; \" et incarnatus est de Spiritu Sancto, ex Maria Virgine, et homo factus est,\" sang the choir, and looking up, arrested by the thrilling notes, Veronia percehed the whole multitude upon their knees. The music mounted again, the crowd arose, while Mademoiselle de Meiml, touched and ashamed of her apparent but involun tary contumely, sank back upon her seat. \" And ivas made man,\" \u2014 this then Avas the thought that had draAvn together that multitude for its celebration ; this that had bowed it in adoration to the earth, this was the idolatry of the Romish Church, this its superstition ; and she, she alone of all those present, had not bent the knee. Veronia's heart beat, and for some minutes she dared not look around. When she again did so, a movement in the croAvd below at tracted her attention \u2014 the confessionals were becoming surrounded by fresh arrivals, and with a deeper interest than before she watched this neAv phase of devotion.

No outward sign of fear or per turbation was visible among them, that her eye, at least, could trace, until, at last, a girl advanced with timid step, and took a vacant place. There were others waiting who must pass before her, and as she clasped her hands together, and buried her face in them, she seemed summoning courage, as it appeared to Veronia, for the ordeal. Long she remained thus, until her frame began to tremble, her breast to heave, and soon it was evident that deep but silent sobs were rending her heart. Mademoiselle de M^hul was still Avatching and compassionating her, when she observed a neighbour touch her on the arm, and whisper something in her ear. Then she raised a face bathed in tears, dashed them hastily aside, and disappeared into the shadow of the confessional. With an interest new to herself, Veronia watched earnestly for her return, wondering Avhat could have caused her agitation, and what effect upon her the act she was en gaged in would produce."], [299, "VERONIA. 293 Meanwhile the mass progressed. The priest's communion, and that of his assistants, was accomplished. The spotless linen was spread upon the altar rails, and humbly the members of the congregation drew near to participate in the sacred feast.

Sadly did the lamenting sound fall on many a heart within the deep recesses of the city, deepening the sense of melancholy, and awakening in sick and restless minds full many a memory of pain or sorroAV.

It was that of a tall and slender man, of pale complexion, who, seated beside the fire, was gazing fixedly, and even sadly, into its depths, with a profound abstraction Avhich showed that his thoughts were far away. To a looker-on a part, at least, of his despondency might have been accounted for by the fact of his sickly aspect, and that of the sleeve crossed upon his breast being empty \u2014 something soldierly, although list less in his bearing, showed how the loss had been sustained. Nine o'clock was striking, when the sound of the shop-beU caused him to look up, and as he did so, to display a still young and interesting countenance, worn deeply, how ever, by either grief or sickness.

At the day appointed all the population con cerned in this traffic assemble to hear mass offered for the happy and prosperous voyage and safe return of the fishermen. It was past the hour at which the cere mony usually commenced, when Van Helder left his own dwelUng to join the throng that were to assist at it; but to re main through the duration of an entire service was by no means to the Doctor's taste, and yet not to join them at the foot of the altar was a violation of native etiquette, of which he was equally incap able. He had, as usual, therefore, timed his departure so as to arrive within a few minutes of the end. Gaily he sprang along, dashing aside at intervals the blinding snow-flakes as they choked his sight, and impatiently shaking his long mackintosh to clear it of the same. The cold was bitter, and an ejaculation at its intensity often escaped him. \"Ha! \" exclaimed he, stopping suddenly, as the faint, distant sound of a bell came upon his ear, \" the consecration now \u2014 good I I x 2"], [314, "308 VERONIA. shall arrive before the blessing;\" and wheel ing suddenly round, so as to make a stand against the gale, he dreAv from his pouch a pipe, succeeded, after some trouble, in light ing it, and then, with an appearance of satisfaction, pursued his course once more. \" Geese ! milksops ! that would do away with the pipe,\" muttered he to himself. \"Asses! old women!\" and, with this decided expression of opinion he relapsed into silence. His road lay in the direction of the De Mehuls' former cottage, leading to a small fishing hamlet \u2014 comprised in his own parish of St. Andrew \u2014 which skirted the shore, and nestled in a hollow, backed by the tall sand hills we have so often described. On the top of one of these stood a small chapel dedicated to \"Mary, Star of the Sea,\" and around this were noAv gathered, with their wives and children, the crews of those vessels about to sail.

Around these, in various atti tudes of devotion, with folded arms, and the reverential air which characterises their simple piety, stood or knelt the seamen mentioned, while behind those again, knelt, in their picturesque costume, the female colony. Over all came down pitilessly the wild snow-storm, while so placid and undis turbed remained the Avorshippers, that the scene looked rather like a picture than one of actual life.

And truly on that day of parting was the Doctor in himself a star of good omen to many an anxious soul. His smile, the hearty greeting and words of hope and pro mise he dispensed, served as a cordial to many whose hearts would otherwise have sunk. From young to old he hurried to and fro.

Brave fellows, very children in experience, even beside that would-be philosopher and cynic, yet scarce more innocent of Avorldly craft than he ; how they pressed round him, gladdened by his very look, his hearty greeting, the grasp of his hand, and cheered and comforted \u2014 while they breasted the sharp breeze so soon to bear them aAvay \u2014 by the thought of what he would be in the hour of need or sickness to those they left behind ! \" Meinheer, meinheer, a word, so please"], [318, "312 VERONIA. you,\" said a battered, grey old sailor, coming to his side, \" a word all for myself, so please you ; I'm the oldest of the men, you know ; they will all see you again, no doubt, maybe, I shan't.\" \" 'Tis well, old sea-prophet, put it so by all means,\" laughed Van Helder, as he separated himself from the rest of the sailors, and stepped aside Avith the speaker. \" I thought you Avere going to say you wouldn't find me alive on your return, and I should object to being disposed of in that way, do you understand?\" The old man was silent ; no response to the Doctor's gaiety appeared on his Aveather beaten features, and, turning away from his felloAVS, he seemed as if he wished to draw his companion to some distance aside. Van Helder glanced inquisitively at him, but perceiving the serious look, yielded im mediately to his evident desire. \"Meinheer, meinheer,\" called the other seamen, turning eagerly after him as he moved away, \" we can't part with you yet ; you're not going to leave us till the end.\" \"No, no, my lads; no fear, keep ahead"], [319, "VERONIA. 313 for a moment or so, and I'll join you at the Beacon,\" and waving his hand towards a little inn which stood upon the edge of the shore, he turned again to his companion. \"Noav, then, Father Thomas,\" said he, Avhen, having reached a nook between two hillocks, they stood alone, sheltered a little from the beating snoAV and wind, \" noAv then, old friend, what is the point at issue ?

Van Helder looked sideways at him, with a gleam of his native sarcasm in his eye, as he answered : \" It is right and proper, Father Thomas, you should feel so, with such a voyage be fore you ; I commend your piety, but you"], [320, "314 VERONIA. know I can't share it, so let us talk of the other subject, whatever it may be, you wished to entertain me with.

Do you leave none to my charge ? \" \" But one,\" replied the old man, so lemnly. \"Wife and child of mine no longer"], [321, "315 VERONIA. walk the earth ; they went before me, as you know, long years ago, and, dearly as I loved them, I never murmured, for their deaths opened heaven to me, and taught me the value of a Christian's faith.

Not possessing a definite notion of what a Turk might be, Godensca looked for a moment puzzled; but the irresistible glass of beer which the host at this moment pressed into her hand, led her thoughts into another channel and the consideration of a toast. \" Here's to your health, and the Frau's health, and the baby's teeth,\" said she, standing erect before the young couple, and glancing toAvards the third unconscious par ticipant in the compliment Avith an air of compassion. \" I'm glad I'm a maid myself,\" she added, after a large draught of the beverage. \" WeU now, I Avonder at that, Fraulein, so pleasant as you are \u2014 such a tidy manager and all \u2014 I'm sure you would make any hus band happy.\" \"Maybe I should,\" was the unaffected answer; \"but then the baby !

Lent had come and gone ; the snowdrop had passed away, and the bright crocus had returned, herald of coming sunshine, whose furtive gleams had yet been \" few and far between.\" Spring, beautiful and harsh by turns as ever in those northern climes, had pene trated with her subtle charm the senses of Veronia, awakening in her that vague and dreamy sensibility which seems to partake alternately of the nature of hope and recol lection. To those Avho have suffered through the long hours of winter, the afflicted in mind or body, the watcher by the sick bed, the mourner, the forsaken in spirit, the disappointed, the injured, the guilty,"], [338, "332 VERONIA. even to the most wretched of these, comes, with that first faint smile ofthe spring-tide, a throb of renovated life, a draught, though it may be but one, of the elixir \" hope.\" So came it to Veronia. The peace, the deep seclusion of her con vent life, succeeding as it had done to a period cf such mental strife, had served to restore the tired energies, to soothe the harassed nerves; and youth combining Avith an unbroken constitution was fast restoring the equilibrium which had been so cruelly disturbed. The very excess of anguish to which she had been subjected, had neutra lized itself, for passion must either die or kill the being on which it has fastened. Such an alternative inevitably closes the struggle, and often, as in her case, does the victim happily become the conqueror. Gradually, imperceptibly, but no less surely had the change been Avrought ; until, as Van Helder had foretold, the very satiety of grief had given birth to that impetuous desire, that need of happier days, which is so strong an ingredient in the nature of ycuth. \" Life can hold for me no more bitterness,"], [339, "333 VERONIA. as it can hold no more joy,\" had she once said, and this in part Avas true ; intenser anguish than that with which the young heart suffers maturer years can never knoAv, but is not youth's joy a dream compared with that which comes to us Avith the frui tion of life's after Avishes ? The first symptom of a revival in Veronia was the fact, not unnoticed by her attendant sister, that she began to feel the gloom of her apartment oppressive, to sigh as she looked up at the inaccessible Avindows, and Avatch, with the eye of a miser on his gold, the slightest thread of sunshine that streamed across them ; but no Avord on the subject had ever passed her lips, and yet the kind sister divined the wish these signs betokened. The windows were very high, and the Fraulein was accustomed, perhaps, Avhen in the world to see Avhat Avas going on outside, but in a convent, of course, it was different, and there Avas in this instance nothing to regret, as the Fraulein's windows only looked out on the Quadrangle, but there was a window in the convent from Avhich all the city could be seen, and \u2014 when the"], [340, "334 VERONIA. sun shone \u2014 part of the country also, if the Fraulein desired it.\" An ardent lover of both air and sunshine, Veronia grasped at the offer with a glad ness which surprised herself, and enrap tured the kind soul who had made it, and who noAv reproached herself severely that such a thought had not before occurred to her. \" But, in fact, the Fraulein,\" she said, \"had never until then seemed to care whether there were windows or not ; and, for her own part, of course, as a nun, it really did signify so little, that the idea of such a pleasure had never occurred to her ; but noAV nothing was so easy, if the Frau lein did not mind climbing very high, for it was up a flight of stairs \u2014 in an attic, in fact, Avhere all the lumber of the sisterhood was stored,\" &c, &c. Furnished Avith the key of this receptacle and the Lady-Superior's permission to visit it, Veronia found herself in possession of an enjoyment, the long deprivation of which had immeasurably enhanced its value, a glimpse, in fact, of the heavens and of the world beneath them. Often in the early morning would she"], [341, "VERONIA. 335 penetrate to this retreat, Avhich, dark and dusty as it was Avith the accumulated rubbish of years, yet opened a sort of paradise to her enchanted view. Situated on the attic floor of the build ing, and towering far above the neighbour ing houses, on which it looked doAvn, the narroAv casement offered a distant prospect of far-off country, a glimpse of sky, and a bird's-eye view of the grand old city below. Nothing but imagination could have invested the very imperfect sight of these, which could only thence be obtained, with such a charm, but to Veronia it was an unceasing source of interest and delight. Intense was the pleasure to the imprisoned girl of leaning for a few brief moments at that dusty sill \u2014 of inhaling the morning breeze that kissed her Aveary broAV \u2014 of watching the sunbeams which, struggling through the darkness of a thousand chimneys, fell so kindly across her bounded horizon ! The plenitude of beauty presented to a heart less saddened might have drawn forth less homage than that Avhich these canty blessings now kindled in hers.

But vaguely still the future floated before her, nor could she yet form in con nection Avith it any matured plan. The image of her base cousin stood betAveen her and the home which her uncle's kindness had offered, and made her recoil as pain fully as ever from its acceptance. Though the bitterness of her deception was over, though her former lover noAv no more represented to her the ideal she had loved than he in reality resembled it, still the feeling of perfect indifference to him had yet to be acquired, and to live Avith him calmly under the same roof, to meet him hourly in the familiarity of home, to let him touch her hand morning and evening in friendly salutation, to return his false smile, and forget the past \u2014 this, this was too hard, too sharp a task for the proud, frank spirit that had never learnt the worldly art of feigning. Sometimes in her dreams she had met him thus, and the relief of awakening"], [343, "337 VERONIA. had reconciled her to solitude and all the hard realities of her convent life. What in effect is hard compared to the horror of daily association with a human being Avhom we loathe or despise ? Lent, as we have said, was over. It was one of the first days of Easter week, and very early in the morning. Veronia lay stiU sleeping calmly, when she was roused by the entrance of her nun. \" I have come a little before your usual hour, Fraulein,\" said she, bustling about in some excitement, \" because there is a person waiting to see you who says that she has a message from the Dr. Van Helder.

A thousand francs of fortune he's got, and a room furnished, and all,\" said Godensca, with a proud accent ; \" the pastor says it would be a fine marriage, too.\" \" Well, but if he is sixty, poor fellow, he hasn't so much time to spare, and you are past middle life, also, are you not, Godensca?\" \" Forty-seven years old, and sixteen days,\" said the latter, who looked old for fifty ; \" and I've a deal of work in me yet, so it is nonsense to think of stopping while I can"], [349, "343 VERONIA. go on, as I've told him plain.
