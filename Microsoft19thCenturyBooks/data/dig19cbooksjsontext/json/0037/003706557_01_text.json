The standard pilot books are most excellent and carefully written works, but, for the ordinary pleasure sailor in home waters, they give both too much and too little information. Too much, because they confuse the mind with shoals and rocks which can only be dangerous to merchant vessels of heavy draught, or clumsy coasters incapable of beating against a strong inset. Too little, because their information is confined strictly to matters of navigation, whereas a yachtsman wants to know something of the history and topography of the parts which he visits ; something, too, of the places of interest, or beauty, or amusement, in or near to them, and of their amenities and conveniences from a pleasure seeker's standpoint. In this little book, I have endeavoured to combine as much pilotage as is required by the owner or skipper of, say a fifty tonner, with a chatty descrip tion of other matters of local interest likely to be useful or amusing. In order to lighten somewhat the body of the work of technical details, I have appended, at the conclusion of each chapter, (i) a table of magnetic courses and distances, (2) a des cription of lights, and (3) an account of the tidal streams. This plan has the additional advantage of concentrating these details, so that they may be readily found ; whereas in most of the standard pilot books, they are scattered about without any regard to the reader's convenience.

THE Channel is probably regarded by most English folk as a land of marine purgatory, the torments of which must be endured by all who would reach the fair havens of Paris or Brussels, Berlin or Vienna. Even many of those favoured children of fortune who pass their lives on its shores, look upon it with mixed feelings of dread and admiration, and would consider a cruise from the Straits to Falmouth in anything less than a mail steamer as a distinct and almost blasphemous \"tempting of Providence.\" And yet, surely we, the fortunate heirs of Shakespeare's \" Sceptred Isle \" ought to love '\u2022 This silver sea, Which serves it in the office of a wall, Or as a moat defensive to a house, Against the envy of less happier lands ;\" for it is not only our bulwark against aggression, but the basis of our commercial greatness, and the inlet by which the kindly waters of the gulf impart to our southern shores a warmth without which we might find ourselves reduced to the climate of Moscow or Quebec. Moreover, the Channel has a glorious record, and was the scene of many of those great struggles of the past which are leading marks in the history of our country. Here, between Dover and Ramsgate, the legions of C\u00e6sar forcibly brought Roman civilization into Britain. Later on the Conqueror, landing near Hastings, introduced that element of Norman"], [16, "INTRODUCTORY. 2 blood and Norman custom which has had such a remarkable effect upon our development as a nation. Here too, at Plymouth, Howard of Effingham, Drake, Hawkins, Frobisher and Mannington. \" set on a brag countenance,\" and with their fleet of tiny ships (many under ioo tons burthen and scarce any over iooo) boldly attacked the great Armada, and \" gave them chase, as though we had wanted nothing until we had cleared our own coast, and some part of Scotland.\" Here in Torbay, William of Orange landed, and sealed the fate of the Stuart Dynasty ; and here many stoutly contested battles have been fought between our vessels and those of the French and Dutch during the 18th and the early part of the 19th centuries, not always ending so gloriously for England as is generally assumed. But alas ! there is a sombre and still more tragic side to the picture, only brightened by the heroism and self-sacrifice of those \" Storm Warriors \" of whom the Rev. John Gilmore has so eloquently and sympathetically written. For, year by year, the Channel claims its tribute of wrecked ships and gallant lives, some times in great disasters like the storm of November nth, 1891, which startled the entire nation, but oftener in accidents to obscure fishing or coasting craft which passing unnoticed, save for a few lines under the ever recurring head of \"Disasters at Sea \" in the daily press, yet bring untold grief and utter destitution to many a happy home. But to those for whom this work is mainly written, the Channel is not only interesting historically, commercially, and geographically, but is above all a delightful playground where the worries and anxieties of the shore may be cast aside for a time, and where pure and vigorous breezes will quickly repair the inroads which those anxieties and worries may have made both in body and mind. For the Channel is not ever turbulent as many think ; there are in summer, to quote the beautiful lines of Mr. R. Buchanan, frequent \" Golden dawns and glassy days, When the vast sea is smooth and sunk in rest, And in the sea the gentle heaven doth gaze, And seeing its own beauty smiles its best, With nights of peace, when in a virgin haze God's moon wades through the shallows of the mist."], [17, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 3 The Channel is, in truth, as pleasant a summer sea as the pleasure sailor need desire, and although it cannot boast the grandeur of the scenery of the West of Scotland or Ireland, yet in many parts (particularly along the shores of Devon and Cornwall) it possesses coasts and harbours of the greatest beauty, while it has many prosaic advantages of its own, in climate, in proximity to London, and in the facility with which stores can be obtained and repairs done, the absence of which often causes real discomfort in a yachting cruise. The English side of the Channel too, is well furnished with \u2014 \" Harbourage for ourselves, our ships and men.\" herein differing from the French Coast, where havens in (_trV-_ which vessels can be afloat at high water, are few and far between. In short, taking it all in all, the English Channel is as fine a yachting ground as need be desired. But in addition to the Channel properly so called, the Downs and the Thames Estuary as far as Harwich, form part of the cruising ground of a south country pleasure sailor, and I have therefore included them in an account of that \" Silver Streak,\" to which this little work is intended to be a guide. With this explanation, I now invite my readers to accompany me on an imaginary cruise from Harwich to the Scilly Isles, taking the River Medway, and various harbours of the Channel en route."], [18, "CHAPTER II. HARWICH AND ITS RIVERS. \" And Stour, that parteth with his pleasant flood The Eastern Saxon from the southern nigh, And Clare and Harwich both doth beautify.\" Faerie Queen. STEPPING out of the train at Harwich a five minutes walk takes us to the pier, whence the dingey will transport us to our little ship which lies in the usual yacht anchorage in the River Stour, between Harwich and Parkstone jetties. Having stowed our gear and refreshed the inner man, we may do well to take a survey of our surroundings. A glance at the chartlet will shew that the fine sheet of water in which we are lying is formed by the Rivers Stour and Orwell which here unite, and, after flowing together for the space of about a mile and a half, discharge themselves into the North Sea between Dovercourt and Languard Point. The harbour is well sheltered from all winds, and is only 71 miles by railway from London. Add to this the fact that it possesses a good club and a bracing climate, and its popularity with Thames yachtsmen will not be found surprising. Harwich is also one of the most important ports on the East Coast of England, and daily communication is now established between it and the Continent by means of the \u00a3r$.E. Railway Co's. fine steamers, plying to and from Rotterdam, Amsterdam, and the Hague. They all sail from Parkstone Pier (to the West of Harwich) shortly after 10 p.m. every night, and are very fine vessels. A guard-ship (generally an ironclad) is also stationed here. The harbour is very spacious, and in the old days (when Her Majesty's ships were not so cumbrous as they are now) it is said that 100 men-of- war and 300 to 400 colliers have been at anchor there at one time, without crowding or riding in danger of one another. Even now there can be no doubt that it would in war time shelter a large fleet."], [19, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 5 The value of Harwich as a place of arms is not a modern discovery, the very name being derived from two Saxon words signifying the headquarters of an army. But even before the days of the Saxons, the Romans undoubtedly had a camp near the town of considerable extent, which may still be traced. The high road leading to it is still called \" the Street,\" and several Roman coins have been dug up in the neighbourhood of it. One of the earliest of our recorded sea fights took place at Harwich in the year 885, between the fleet of King Alfred and that of the Danes, in which the latter were repulsed, and another took place in 1666, between the Dutch and English fleets, in which the Dutch were defeated. It is said that the rise of Harwich is due to a very curious natural phenomenon, viz., the submergence of a former town called Orwell, which stood on what is now a shoal outside Harwich harbour known as the West Rocks. Certain it is, that ruins of buildings have been discovered on West Rocks. Tradition also says that formerly the outlet of the harbour which is now south of Languard Point lay to the north of it, at a spot occupied by Felixstowe Marsh.* If this be true, it would seem probable that the extensive shoals which lie between the west side of the entrance and the land, (com prising West Rocks, the Cork Sand, the Stone Banks, and the Naze Flats), and the site of the present Channel, were dry land, and, together with Languard Point, formed the southern barrier of the harbour, somewhat in the same way as the peninsula of Pendennis now forms the south-western barrier of Falmouth harbour, which, in its general configuration, is not unlike that of Harwich. Anyhow, it is certain, that all along the Thames estuary, the sea is, and has for centuries past, been gaining slowly but surely on the land. The town of Harwich itself is devoid of interest, and the one building of note, the church of St. Nicholas, only dates from 1 82 1. Dovercourt, which is situated about half a mile east of Harwich, is a rapidly improving watering place, possessing a chalybeate spring, similar to that at Tunbridge Wells. The * Beauties of England and Wales, Vol. V. 329."], [20, "6 HARWICH AND ITS RIVERS. Spa house is fitted with a library and reading room, and a museum of fossils and Roman antiquities, and is a great resort of visitors If you desire to get rid of a spare hour or so, you might well pay it a visit. Probably both Harwich and Dovercourt must now yield the palm to Felixstowe, which is situated to the north-east of the entrance. This town, which was largely the creation of the late Col. Tomlin, is becoming a very favourite watering place, and boasts a pier, harbour, and railway station, (the latter close to the pier). The route to London by this railway is via Ipswich, and is somewhat longer than the route from Harwich, but is convenient in the case of yachts lying off Felixstowe pier. There are also golf links at Felixstowe for those who like that game. The day of our arrival is too far spent to make it prudent to sail over the flats to Brightlingsea, so let us take what the local steamboat managers describe as \u2014 \" a flit into the German ocean.\" . . Having weighed our anchor, we round Harwich Pier, and make for the \" Guard \" buoy which is moored on the south side of the entrance to the Stour. Leaving this on our star board hand, we steer S.E. for about 600 yards until past the \"North Shelf\" buoy which is also left on our starboard side. The course is now S. by W., keeping the line of red and white buoys on the same side, until we come to the bell buoy off Languard Fort. Leaving this on our port side, we alter our course abruptly, steering E. by S. for the Cork lightship, passing between a red and white striped buoy to starboard, and two red ones to port. We may then consider ourselves launched on the waters of the German Ocean, and enjoy a few hours sail up and down the coast before returning into harbour by moonlight. The time having arrived for a retreat, we again make for the Cork lightship, and thence keep a west course until the two bright lights of Dovercourt are in one N.W. by W. L W. Then keeping them in one, we sail direct for them and this will bring us right down to the bell buoy. As the night is calm, and the wind offshore, a quieter and pleasanter anchor age than the Stour, and one in which the water is cleaner and"], [21, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 7 fresher for the morning \" tub,\" will be found off Felixstowe Pier towards the red light on which, we accordingly direct our little craft. If the weather had been less favourable, and we had found a gale raging on our arrival at Harwich, I should not have advised lying either in the Stour or off Felixstowe, for in both situations at such times '; Thou art like to have A lullaby too rough.\" Our best course would therefore have been to run five miles up the Orwell to Pin Mill, where a small vessel may ride in absolute safety and comfort in 3 fathoms least water. It must not, however, be supposed that Pin Mill is only to be visited as a refuge, for in truth it is a pretty sail in all weathers, and at all times of the tide. This little village is situated on the west bank of the river, about five miles from Harwich. It is extremely lovely and rural, resembling some what King Harry's Ferry on the River Fal, and the bells of a neighbouring church on the east bank, are some of the most charmingly musical that I have ever heard in England. A quiet summer evening at anchor at this little spot cannot fail to please. A pull of about five miles in the dingey will bring one to Ipswich, whence there is an excellent service of trains to London. The River Stour is so encumbered with mud flats that it cannot be recommended for a cruise, nor is its scenery to be compared with that of the Orwell ; still it is a fine sheet of water for dingey sailing, or for enjoying a few hours in one of the centre board yachts for which the locality is famous"], [22, "CHAPTER III. HARWICH TO BRIGHTLINGSEA. \" But I shall think of shallows and of flats. Mer. of Ven., I. i. FOR a yacht of moderate draft (eight or nine feet) the most direct course from Harwich to Brightlingsea is by way of the Medusa Channel, across the Naze flats, and thence down the Wallet. For vessels of heavier draft how ever, it is safer to go round the Cork lightship, and outside the Cork Sands and West Rocks, and thence through Goldmer's gat into the Wallet. * As our vessel only draws nine feet, we will proceed over the flats ; but as there is not more than 6 feet in the channel at low water, we will not start until the flood tide begins to make. The shallow Medusa Channel lies between the Naze on the west, and the shoals known as the Stone Banks, Cork Sand, and West Rocks on the east. Taking our departure from the bell buoy we steer direct for the Stone Banks buoy (red and white vertical stripes), S. J W., three miles distant. Passing this buoy close on our port hand, we continue the above course for about one-and-a-half miles, until the Naze Tower bears N.N.W. | W., when we are well into the Wallet. The Wallet is a huge pudding-bag of a waterway, about eighteen miles long and three wide, bounded on the N.W\". and W. by the Essex Coast, and on the S.E. by the dangerous Gunfleet and Buxey Sands. These sands act as a break water, and consequently it is almost always calmer in the Wallet than it is outside in the great marine highway to the north called \" The Swin.\" The Wallet is far deeper on the Gunfleet side than it is on the Essex shore, so that it is necessary to give the Essex Coast a berth of at least a mile until past Clacton-on-Sea, (which is situated about halfway between Walton and the Colne, and may be known by its pier). The shoal then becomes more extensive, forming a \u2022The magnetic courses for this route will be found at the end of the chapter."], [23, "OUR SILVER STREAK. g spit called Priory Spit, the extreme south point of which is marked by a red buoy, and at and after this point the Essex shore cannot be safely approached within a mile-and-a-half, until the large gas buoy called \" Knoll,\" which is moored at the entrance of the Channel into the Colne, is passed- With regard to the other side of the Wallet, bounded by the Gun fleet, the sand is very steep-to, and as it is one-and-a-half miles broad in the middle by the lighthouse, we must not approach within that distance of the line of buoys which mark the south-eastern edge, and directly the water begins to shoal to less than six fathoms go about. Having fetched Priory Spit buoy (red) we make for the large gas buoy, distant about two miles, marked \" Knoll,\" moored on the west side of the entrance of the channel into the Colne. Thence the course is N.W. W., leaving the above mentioned \" Knoll \" buoy to port, and the red buoys named \" Eagle \" and \" Colne Bar \" well to starboard, as they mark the west edge of most dangerous shoals. After passing Colne Bar buoy we steer about north, leaving the white fishing buoy on the port hand and keeping well on the east side of the entrance until opposite Brightlingsea Creek, when we can bring up in four fathoms ; or if the weather were coarse we could run up Pyefleet (the channel between the north of Mersea Island and the mainland), where a vessel can ride out the worst gale in safety and comfort. Brightlingsea is quite a yachting town, and good hands are to be obtained there, but to my mind it is not a good yachting rendezvous, as two changes are necessary in order to get to London, viz., one at Wivenhoe and one at Colchester. This necessarily makes the journey irksome, especially if you are taking down stores. Moreover, if the main line trains are late, as not unfrequently happens on Saturday afternoons in the summer months, you may miss the train from Wivenhoe to Brightlingsea, and find yourself stranded for several hours. The distance too from Bright lingsea station to the landing place in the creek is considerable, and on a hot summers day, with a heavy \" Gladstone *' or a hamper of provisions, this does not improve the temper. On the whole therefore, Brightlingsea does not strike me as at all a good head-quarters for yachting. It has, however, one great"], [24, "HARWICH TO BRIGHTLINGSEA. 10 recommendation, viz., its oysters. These called \" Colchester Natives \" are excellent, and may be obtained at a little more than half the price charged in the London shops from Mr. Stammers, to whose place any of the human natives will direct the hungry yachtsman.

THE BLACKWATER AND CROUCH RIVERS. \" Plenteous rivers and wide skirted meads,\" Lear, I. i. JUST outside and to the westward of the Colne and at nearly right angles to it is the river Blackwater. The author of \"Mehalah\" gives .the following description of this part of the country \u2014 \" Between the mouths of the Blackwater and the Colne, on the east coast of Essex, lies an extensive marshy tract, veined and freckled in every part with water. It is a wide waste of debateable ground contested by sea and land, subject to incessant incursions from the former but stubbornly maintained by the latter. At high tide the appearance is that of a vast surface of moss or Sargasso weed floating on the sea, with rents and patches of shining water traversing and dappling it in all directions. The creeks, some of considerable length and breadth, extend many miles inland, and are arteries whence branches out a fibrous tissue of smaller channels flushed with water twice in the twenty-four hours. At noon tides, and especially at the equinoxes, the sea asserts its royalty over this vast region, and overflows the whole, leaving standing out of the flood only the long island of Mersea, and the lesser isle called the Roy. * * * A more desolate region can scarce be con ceived, and yet it is not without its beauty. In summer the thrift mantles the marshes with shot satin passing through all gradations of tint, from maiden's blush to lily white. There after a purple glow steals over the waste, as the sea lavender bursts into flower, and simultaneously every creek and pool is royally fringed with sea aster. A little later the glass wort that shot up green and transparent as emerald glass in the early spring, turns to every tinge of carmine. When all vegetation ceases to live and goes to sleep the marshes are alive and wakeful with countless wild fowl. At all times they are haunted with sea mews and royster crows, in winter. they teem with wild ducks and grey geese. The stately heron loves to wade in the pools, occasionally the whooper swan"], [26, "THE BLACKWATER AND CROUCH RIVERS. 12 sounds his loud trumpet, and flashes a white reflection in the still blue waters of the fleets. The plaintive pipe of the curlew is familiar to those who frequent the marshes, and the barking of the brent geese as they return from their northern breeding places is heard in November.\" This eloquent and graphic description is by no means over coloured, and gives an excellent idea of the nature and appearances of this flat and curious region. The Blackwater is not a difficult river to navigate, as the shoals lie exclusively along the shores, and the channel keeps fairly midway between them as far as Osea Island, after which it becomes very narrow and tortuous, and cannot be attempted by a stranger without the assistance of a pilot. To enter the Blackwater, we proceed towards Colne Bar buoy (mentioned in the last chapter) which is situated at the confluence of the deep channels of the Colne and Blackwater, kept apart up to this point by an extensive flat lying to the south of Mersea Island. From Colne Bar buoy, the course is W.N.W. about a mile, until the red and white ringed buoy called \" Bench Head \" is passed on the starboard hand. We are then in the Blackwater, and must keep mid-channel, about N.W., until past the west extremity of Mersea Island. Thence the river curves slightly to the southward, and the course becomes W. by S. J S. for nearly three miles, Peawit Island being left three or four hundred yards to port. When the vessel is exactly between Tollesbury Church on the north bank, and St. Laurence's Church on the south, the Channel runs direct for Osea Island about W. by N., being here decidedly nearer to the south bank than to the north. An interesting row may be had in a dingey from Osea Island to Maldon (about five miles) which is an important market town, delightfully situated on a hill from which a fine view of the Blackwater is obtained. Having sailed out of the Blackwater, let us now visit the River Crouch, which is the third of the Essex rivers de bouching into the Wallet. It is renowned for the sport which it affords in winter to the wild-fowler, the saltings on Foulness Island being perhaps more frequented by these birds than any other place on the coast. Of course the services of"], [27, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 13 a local fowler and his gunning punt are required for this sport. To enter this river, we must take our departure from the Knoll gas buoy and steer S.W. by W., leaving the red and white chequered buoy, and afterwards the beacon on the Buxey sand to port. When past the Buxey beacon, we alter our course to S.W. by S. until a quarter of a mile past the red Buxey buoy (which leave to port), and then steer W. by S. until well in the river. After this, we may keep about mid channel until the tributary River Roach * on the south side of the channel is reached. From this point the north shore must be hugered (as there is a bank or \u25a0' horse\" on the south shore) until we arrive at Burnham, where there is a \"horse\" with one and a half fathoms in mid-river. Here we may bring up, or proceed five or six miles further up in not less than one and a quarter fathoms L.W.S. It is now possible to take the railway at Burnham, and proceed direct to London, which makes it a far more convenient port than it was formerly. There is another passage into the Crouch leading from the Swin Channel. This Channel starts from the Whitaker Spit gas buoy, whence the course is due west, passing between two red buoys to starboard, and a red and white chequered one to port. When the second red (Buxey) buoy is reached, the course is W. by S. until well into the river as above directed. Generally the Blackwater and the Crouch afford good smooth water sailing, and first rate wild fowl shooting ; but the surrounding country is flat, marsh)', and devoid of interest, and may also be conjectured to be not over healthy. * This river (the Roach) is navigable even at low water sprirgs, for up wards of three miles, as also is Havengore creek which runs out of the south side of it. About two and a half mil s up the Roach, on the nor'h bank, some pilots live who would be found u-eful by the wild-fowler."], [28, "CHAPTER V. FROM THE COLNE TO THE NORE. \" River ! O. river ! upon thy tide Full many a freighted bark doth ride.\" Hoffman, THERE is a narrow and shallow passage out of the Wallet between the Gun Fleet and Buxey Sands, called \" the Whitaker Spitway,\" and as this saves a long journey round by Goldmers Gat, it is generally used by yachts sailing from Brightlingsea to the Nore. It is however, un doubtedly silting up, and at low water springs one cannot reckon on more than six feet of water in the channel ; and at extraordinary springs there is considerably less than that. Starting from the Knoll gas buoy, the course to the inner Spitway buoy (red and white horizontal stripes with staff and cross) is S.E. \\ E. two and a half miles. We pass this buoy close on either hand, and steer for the outer or south Spitway bell buoy (black) S. f E. Leaving this to the westward, we must now direct our course S.W. \\ S. for the Whitaker gas buoy distant about two miles. Leaving this to starboard, we are in the main north channel of the Thames Estuary, known as \"the Swin \" through which a crowd of shipping continuously passes to and fro between London and the North. The channels of the Thames Estuary, may be roughly compared to a man's left hand stretched palm downwards on a table. The wrist answers to the River Thames, the back of the hand to the wide sheet of water between Shoeburyness and the Isle of Sheppy, and the West Oaze Sand. The little finger represents the Swin Channel, the first finger the Barrow deep, the middle finger the Oaze and Black deeps, the first finger the Prince's Channel, and the thumb the shallow channels over the Kentish flats. A glance at the chartlet will shew the truth of this comparison. The Swin cannot be said to have any scenery whatever for the Essex shores are low and but faintly visible, while the coast of Kent is too distant to enable any of its features to be"], [29, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 15 observed. At low water the great Maplin Sands stretch their dreary length for miles to the north-west, \u2022' A land that is lonelier than ruin, A sea that is stranger than death ; Far fields that a rose never blew in Wan waste where the winds lack breath. Waste endless and boundless and flowerless But of marsh blossom fruitless as free. Where earth lies exhausted and powerless, To strive with the sea.\" \u2014 Swinburne. On the south-east the higher parts of the Barrow shoals occasionally show themselves a few feet above the water, while here and there gaunt and weather beaten spars appear above the surface, marking the spots where these dangerous shoals have sealed the fate of vessels which have been caught in their vicinity in thick or stormy weather. The Swin, nevertheless, has a certain charm of its own in the diversity and number of the craft, which at all times form a continuous line from the Mouse right away to the Shipwash. Here may be seen great steamers bound for or from the Baltic ; barques innumerable plying Heaven knows where ; Dutch Schuyts with their picturesque varnished hulls and lee boards; vessels from Russia, and vessels from Norway ; while now and again some graceful member of the pleasure fleet is met with, affording a piquant contrast to the sturdy traders which surround her. A day's sail, therefore, up or down Swin from Harwich or Brightlingsea to the Medway, or vice versa, is by no means to be despised ; and many a pleasant hour have I passed on its sandy and rapidly flowing waters. The northern entrance to th Swin is guarded by the \" Sunk \" lightship, which is moored about three miles S.E. of the West Rocks, and the southern entrance is indicated by the Mouse lightship. Between these two lights (a distance of 27 miles) the channel is lighted by the Gunfleet light house, the Swin middle lightship, and the Maplin lighthouse ; and is further indicated by two lines of buoys, which are painted black or red on the N.W. side of the channel, and black and white on the S.E. side, with the exception of the north Gunfleet and Whitaker Spit buoys, both of which are"], [30, "16 FROM THE COLNE TO THE NORE. painted in black and white rings (the former being furnished with staff and ball, and the latter being lighted with gas), and lie on the N.E. side of the channel. The course down or up the Swin is therefore perfectly well indicated, and presents no difficulty. Entering from the Spitway, and having passed the Whitaker Spit gas buoy, we make for the middle Swin lightship, distant two and a half miles S.W. by W. This may be passed on either hand, and the Channel thence to the Mouse (seven and a half miles) is curved but well buoyed with black buoys to starboard, and black and white ones to port. About half way is the Maplin lighthouse, a red erection of iron supported on legs, outside of which is a gas buoy (black) indicating the extremity of the Sand Spit and bearing S.W. by S. \\ S. from the middle Swin light. This buoy, like all the other black ones, must be left to the northward. At this point the Channel is very narrow (scarcely three-quarters of a mile), and the crowd of shipping is at times rather alarming. They are however on their best behaviour, and if we only obey the rule of the road firmly and properly, there is really not so much danger here as there often is in mid-channel, where only too often the steersman keeps his eyes on the compass, and the look-out indulges in a comfortable nap. Proceeding past the Maplin light, (W. by S. f S.) and passing two of the black buoys which mark the edge of the Maplin Sands, we come across a rough bit of water known as Shoe Hole, where a sudden dip in the Channel causes a lively \"race.\" Moreover, ever and anon on the ebb we find similar little races as we pass the various creeks in the Maplin Sands, which serve as drains to that vast expanse and pour its water with much fury into the Swin at right angles to the main stream of tide. Soon the Mouse lightship is reached, and must be left to the southward. Thence the course to the Nore lightship (seven miles) is W. { S., the Channel being over two and a half miles broad, and indicated on the north by the black Maplin buoys, and on the south by the black and white ones moored along the edges of the Oaze and Cant flats."], [31, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 17 PILOTAGE NOTES.

THE MEDWAY. \" Then came the bride, the lovely Medway came, Clad in a vesture of unknowen gear.\" Spencer's h'aerie Queen. THE spit of sand between the entrances of the Thames and Medway is called the Nore, but the name is also applied to the waters in the vicinity, including the entrance of the Medway. In 1797, in the height of the French War, these waters were the scene of a mutiny, which created more panic throughout England than any of the efforts of Napoleon had done. Such was the scare, that the funds fell to the unheard of price of 57. Captain Marryat in \" The King's Own,\" says : \" There is perhaps no event in the annals of our history which excited more alarm at the time of its occurrence, or has since been the subject of more general interest, than the mutiny at the Nore in the year 1797. Forty thousand men, to whom the nation looked for defence from its surrounding enemies, and in steadfast reliance upon whose bravery it lay down every night in tranquility \u2014 men who had dared every thing for their king and country, and in whose breasts patriotism, although suppressed for the time, could never be extinguished\u2014 irritated by ungrateful neglect on the one hand, and by seditious advisers on the other, turned their guns, which they had so often manned in defence of the English flag, against their own countrymen and their own home, and with all the acrimony of feelings ever attending family quarrels, seemed determined to sacrifice the nation and themselves rather than listen to the dictates of reason and conscience.\" The mutineers, under the leadership of one Parker, removed the fleet at Sheerness (upwards of 30 sail) to the Nore in order to escape the fire of the shore batteries, and blockaded the mouth of the Thames. It is said that Pitt, when informed of the mutiny, at once gave orders, with his accustomed sagacity, to have the buoys and beacons of the various channels removed, so as to prevent the possibility of"], [33, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 19 the ships being taken out to sea and delivered over to the enemy. Anyhow the buoys and beacons were actually removed, and for a time no vessel could approach the Thames from the sea, and consequently the whole trade of London (which was then dependent on sea carriage) was stopped. One of the most dramatic incidents of the mutiny was the escape of the loyal frigate St. Fiorenzo, commanded by Sir Harry Neale, which, in defiance of the mutineers, calmly got under weigh and passed through the mutinous ships, all of which fired upon her. She was struck in many places, but marvellous to relate not a single man was injured. The mutinous vessels being unable to escape from the Nore, or to obtain provisions, began to drop off one by one, and at last Parker's flag-ship surrendered and delivered up the ringleaders, who were duly hanged at the yard arm. The Nore was also the scene of another event no less disgraceful to England in 1667. In that year the Dutch (who in the previous year had received a severe defeat off the mouth of the Thames Estuary), under Admiral De Ruyter, suddenly appeared there again when the English Government was off its guard. Taking advantage of an easterly wind and a spring tide they sailed up the Medway (breaking the chain which then defended the entrance), took Sheerness, and advanced to Chatham, where they burned several ships. It was believed that the next tide would bring them to London Bridge, and the greatest consternation prevailed ; but they neglected their opportunity, and instead made fruitless attacks on Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Harwich, and then again sailed up the Thames to Tilbury, where they were repulsed. It is an unpleasant thought that no steps were taken to wipe out these disgraces, and that shortly afterwards a treaty of peace was signed at Breda. The entrance of the Medway lies between the Nore Sand on the north, and the Cant Sand on the south. The Nore light ship marks the eastern extremity of the one, and a row of red and white chequered buoys indicates the edge of the other. A large gas buoy is also moored on the southern edge of the Nore Sand, and must of course be passed on its south side. From this buoy the course is clear right up to Garrison Fort,"], [34, "THE MEDWAY. 20 which is a large circular fort on the southern shore. The water is very deep close under this fort, but the opposite side of the entrance is shoal, and, until past Sheerness Pier, should be given a wide berth. From the latter point both banks of the river are more or less shoal, but the mud flats are sufficiently indicated by lines of mooring buoys, within which it is not safe to venture. An excellent rendezvous for London yachtsmen is Port Victoria, which is situated on the north shore of the Medway opposite Sheerness, whither a steam ferry plies at intervals. The S.E.R. Co. run trains from Charing Cross to Gravesend, where the passenger to Port Victoria changes into another train, which takes him right on to Port Victoria Pier. Here his dingey can meet him within a few steps from the railway carriage. Port Victoria itself consists merely of the railway station and a wooden and iron bungalow used as an hotel, where the owner of an open boat may obtain a night's lodgings. The place is therefore somewhat desolate ; but the air is fresh and invigorating, and the yachtsman has the choice of a good 20 miles sail up the Medway as far as Chatham and back if the weather proves coarse, or, if it be fine, he is close to the Nore, whence he may shape his course for Brightlingsea (25 miles) or Harwich (50 miles) on the one hand, or for Margate (21 miles) or Ramsgate (25 miles) on the other ; or he may take a spin up Sea Reach. If the wind be northerly, the best plan is to anchor off Port Victoria Pier ; but in southerly or easterly winds there will be a roll there ; indeed, in dirty weather, I have found it difficult to land at the pier. In that case a more comfortable berth will be found in Stangate Creek, which lies almost opposite the pier, or in Colemouth Creek, which is on the north shore about a mile beyond Port Victoria. In entering Stangate Creek the red buoy at the entrance must be left on the starboard hand, as it marks the extremity of a spit running from the western shore of the creek. The anchor may be dropped anywhere about the middle of the creek in five to six fathoms. It is a most sequestered spot, and those who like a thorough change from the noise and bustle of London life, will"], [35, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 21 here find it in perfection. Colemouth Creek is also a very snug little haven. There is here also a spit off the western shore, but it is not buoyed. The stranger should therefore hug the eastern shore until inside the creek, when the channel is about midway between the banks. There is a coastguard station near here, and the owners of single handed craft can get them looked after by these obliging and trustworthy men, which is a great convenience. Those who prefer a little life, will find Queenborough Creek more to their liking, as there are generally several yachts and innumerable barges lying there, and it is also one of the terminal ports of the magnificent Dutch steam packets which leave at ten o'clock every evening for Flushing. It is, however, so crowded as to be far from a quiet anchorage, and we will not seek its shelter. The navigation of the Medway is best understood by a glance at the accompanying chartlet, from which it will be seen that both shores are for the most part shoal until Cookham Woods are reached. In beating to windward, therefore, the banks must be approached with caution, and the use of the lead not neglected. If, however, the wind be fair, a good working rule will be to keep about mid-river. We will bring up for the night at the pleasantest spot in the river, close to the shore under Cookham Woods. Here we may enjoy the nightingales to perfection, and a walk to Hoo Church (distant about a mile) will be time well spent, as it is curious in itself, and its churchyard possesses many quaint epitaphs. Members of recognised yacht clubs, who prefer to anchor off Chatham, can obtain permission at the Commissary General's house to use one of the Government buoys ; and a walk to Rochester Castle will well repay the trouble, but bathing is strictly tabooed at Chatham, and Cookham Woods will generally be found to be far pleasanter quarters."], [36, "CHAPTER VII. THE NORE TO RAMSGATE. 1 Gathered rocks and congregated sands.\" Othello, II. I. THERE are several ways of proceeding from the Nore to the Downs, but for our purpose they may be divided into (i) the direct route over the Kentish flats, and (2) the circuitous route by way of the recognised deep channels of the Thames Estuary. section 1. \u2014 Over the Kentish flats. As we have a leading wind, and our vessel is of moderate draft, our best and most direct route from the Nore to the Downs, is over the Kentish flats, by what is known as the over land passage. As, however, there is in places but little more than seven or eight feet at L.W.S. in the westerly half of this channel, it is necessary to make sure of getting at least half tide at the \" Spaniard \" (which is the shoalest spot).* Taking our departure from the Nore gas buoy during the last hour of the flood tide, we steer S.E. by E. for six miles (leaving two of the black buoys marking the Spile bank on our north side) until we reach the black and white buoy which is moored at the west end of \"the Spaniard.\" Here our difficulties begin. But by taking a sounding near to the buoy and deducting from it one fathom, the result will be the least depth of water which we shall find between us and the West Last buoy at the entrance of the Horse Channel. We find that the depth so obtained is sufficient for our vessel, so we may continue our S.E. by E. course for seven miles more which will bring us up to the West Last buoy. If, however, the soundings at the Spaniard, minus one fathom, had given less * Beside the overland passage described, there is another rather deeper but much more circuitous passage over the flats by way of the so called \"four fathom channel,\" between the Gilman and East Spaniard shoals and then across the Pudding Pan Sand to the West Last buoy ; but it presents few advantages to vessels of moderate draft, and the yachtsman who desires to navigate it is referred to the large scale charts."], [37, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 23 water than we could manage with, then it would have been necessary either to bring up until we got sufficient water, or to go round the north of the West Spaniard and through the four fathom channel. The West Last buoy being reached, is left to the northward, and a course steered about S.E. by E. \u00a3 E. between the line of black buoys and the beacon, which mark the southern edges of the Last Sand and Margate Hook Spit, and the two black and white ones, which are respectively marked \"Horse\" and \" Reculver.\" When a mile past the beacon on the Spit Sand, the course is altered to E. \u00a3 S., keeping about a mile from the shore until we are off Margate. Margate is a place much beloved by Cockneys, but it is not a pleasant yachting station, as the harbour is a dry one, so that, unless one carries \"legs,\" it is necessary to bring up in the roadstead north of the jetty. With southerly winds this is a fair enough berth, but if there be any north in the breeze there is a most unpleasant lop. There is, however, an excellent hotel at Margate (The Cliftonville), a first rate pier and jetty, and all the amuse ments of a regular middle-class watering place, and no doubt man}' worthy people find it pleasureable enough. Speaking personally, I cannot say that I do. But although Margate itself may fail to please, there is no lack of interest about the country west of it, in the neighbour hood of Reculvers. At the present time the expression Isle of Thanet is a geographical misnomer, but there is no doubt, whatever, that in the days of the Roman occupation of Britain, a wide estuary called the Wantsome, which has now entirely disappeared, separated Thanet from the mainland, and was the general passage for shipping between the Downs and the Thames. The Revd. Jno. Batteley, Archdeacon of Canter bury, in his Antiquitates Rutupin\u0153, says: \"This haven has two mouths, the one open to the north and the other to the east. The Castle of Regulbium (Reculvers) was built near the former ; the Castle of Rutupium (Richborough) near the latter, by which, well garrisoned, the haven was formerly closed on each side. A wide valley or level now lies between these castles, in which I think the haven of Rutupium must have been placed ; for though meadows now intervene and a rivulet confined within a very narrow channel flows between them,"], [38, "24 THE NORE TO RAMSGATE. yet if we recollect the old face of the country as it is drawn by ancient writers, and view it with the eye of the mind, we shall soon discover the Port Rutupium the most celebrated in all Britain.\" Solinus the first Roman writer who mentions the Isle of Thanet, says it is washed by the Straits of Gaul, and separated from the Continent of Britain by a small estuary. Bede,* however, says that this estuary was about three furlongs (nearly half a mile) in breadth, and was passable (i.e.. fordable) only in two places, both its mouths extending into the sea. Indeed so large was this vanished strait, that the fleet of Harold is said to have proceeded through it from Sandwich to Reculvers. Even in the 16th century, Jno. Twines says, that in his time there were eight credible living men who affirmed that they had seen large loaded vessels pass and repass through this estuary. Curiously enough, the north entrance at Reculvers has been encroached upon by the sea in quite recent times, while the south entrance off Sandwich has been deserted by the waves, and is now a very considerable distance from the shore. The situation of Reculvers is conspicuously indicated from the sea by two towers, which are the only existing remains of the ancient church. They are now used as a sea mark, and are visible for many miles. Their complete destruction by the sea has only been stayed by the erection of groynes and a stone wall on the beach. Duncombe, writing in the latter half of the last century, says, \" The Roman Town of Regulbium has been long covered by the sea, which last winter threw down the remains of the north side of the old Roman Wall which surrounded the castle, and makes such rapid inroads on the cliff that great part of it, with a house and farmyard adjoining to it, standing within the memory of man, was lately thrown down, and it has long been apprehended that this noble structure and sea mark with all the level below it, notwithstanding the great attentions and expense bestowed on it in planking, piling, &c. by the Commissioners of Sewers, will in a few years share the * Hist Eccl., I 25, t De rebus Albionicis."], [39, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 25 fate of the Roman town above mentioned.\" Indeed there is strong reason to believe that in the Roman times the shores of Kent embraced the whole of the shoals known as the Margate Sands, the Pudding Pan and the Kentish flats. Leaving Margate, we next steer for the Longnose buoy (black and white) which lies about two miles E. \u00a3 S. from Margate jetty. Passing to the northward of this we direct our course for three miles in a S.S.E. direction, keeping about a mile or a mile and a half from the coast, and passing close to the black and white chequered buoy off Broadstairs Knoll. From there the course is S. W. by W. two and a half miles, to the entrance of the old Cudd Channel, which is a narrow spitway leading between the Dike and Quern shoals. This channel is indicated by two buoys, the northern one being black, and the southern black and white chequered. We pass between them (making due allowance for the tide, which sweeps strongly across the channel), and steer W. by N. until a large white diamond on a black ground painted on the inner face of Ramsgate Harbour comes into view, after which the vessel's head is pointed between the pier heads, keeping close to the west pier if the tide is making to the north-east, and close to the east pier if the tide is running to the southward, as it sweeps very strongly across the harbour mouth. The old Cudd only has seven feet and Ramsgate entrance only about six in it at L.W.S., so that at times one may have to wait outside for water. When there is ten feet in the entrance, a red light is shown from the pier lighthouse (at night), and a red ball is hoisted on the West Cliff. When there is less than ten feet, a green light is exhibited at night from the lighthouse ; there is also another green light on the WTest Cliff, and yet another on the East Cliff. The West Cliff light kept in line with the lighthouse light leads through the old Cudd. The East Cliff light kept in one with the lighthouse light shows the fairway inside the Brake and Quern Sands. There is an inner and an outer harbour at Ramsgate, but the outer one is generally used by yachts, as there is six feet in it alongside the quays, even at dead L.W.S. There is, however, a bank in it on the N.E. side, so that the services of a waterman should be engaged before bringing up, unless you are familiar with the place."], [40, "26 THE NORE TO RAMSGATE. If the wind had been light, and it had been hopeless to attempt the passage from the Nore to Margate or Ramsgate in one tide, we might have made two trips of it by resting half way in the Swale. The Swale is the strait which separates the Isle of Sheppey from the mainland, and was at one time navigable throughout from the Medway to the Thames. At present, however, the Sheerness railway bridge effectually prevents the passage of a masted vessel. The entrances to the Swale afford good harbours. The north entrance at Queenborough has already been adverted to. The south entrance, situated about three miles west of Whitstable (famed for its oysters) is the half-way house to which I am now about to direct attention. To make this haven from the Nore gas buoy, steer S.E. by E. until the black and white West Spaniard buoy has been left one-and-a-half miles astern, and the beacon on the Middle Sand is in line with the Middle Spaniard black and white buoy, N. | W, Then keeping this buoy and beacon in one, proceed S. \u00a7 E. for about one-and-a-half miles until you come to the red buoy moored at the north end of the Columbine Sand. Leave this buoy about half-a-mile to the westward steering W.S.W. between red buoys to starboard, and red and white ones to port until the beacon is reached off Shellness Point. Leave this about 300 yards to the westward, and bring up in at least four fathoms. If it be desired to proceed further up the Swale, keep the red buoys to starboard ; but the channel is very narrow and circuitous, and either a large-scale chart or a pilot will be absolutely essential. Leaving the Swale for Margate, it is necessary to steer E.N.E. until the outer or north red Columbine buoy is well abeam, after which an E.S.E. course for five-and-a-half miles will bring you up to the West Last buoy at the mouth of the Horse Channel. section 2. \u2014 The deep channels between the Nure aud Ramsgate. Although we have -come from the Nore by way of the flats, still some information about the deep channels may not be uninteresting or useless ; for yachts of heavy draft cannot safely use the passage over the flats, because, if they lost the"], [41, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 27 wind, they might at low water take the ground and injure themselves. That channel too is not very desirable without a leading wind, (i.e., for going eastward a wind with some west or no more E. than N.N.E. in it, or for going westward a wind between N.N.E. round E. to S.S.W.). With a head wind either the Prince's or Alexandra Channels will be found the best. If bound east with the wind E. to N.E. by N., or bound west with the wind W. to S.S.W., the Alexandra will be the best ; but with the wind S. of E. going eastward or N. of W. going westward, the Prince's will give the largest boards. There are also two other channels, called respectively the Queen's and the Duke of Edinburgh's ; but they present no special advantages, and the yachtsman who wishes to use them must have recourse to a large scale chart. Starting from the Nore lightship, the course is E. by S. \\ S., four and a half miles, to the West Oaze buoy (black and white rings with staff and diamond). Thence steer E. f S. up the Oaze deep for five and a half miles, between black buoys to the north and black and white ones to the south, until the black and white striped bell buoy of the Shivering sand is reached, the large black gas buoy of the Knob Sand being moored a mile to its N.N.E. At this point the Prince's and Alexandra Channels diverge. To go through the Prince's Channel,* steer due south one mile direct for the Girdler light vessel. Round this, and you are in the Prince's Channel, the course through it being E. by S.

'\u2022 Know'st thou the way to Dover ?\" King Lear RAMSGATE, with its suburb Granville, is an extremely pleasant place in itself, and commands most interesting views of the historical \" Downs,\" the well known road- stead lying between the Goodwin Sands and the shores of East Kent. Here, at times, may be seen several hundred sail of vessels waiting for a slant to take them down Channel, while both steam and sailing craft are continually passing, bound to and from every part of the globe. Ramsgate is also an excellent centre from which to visit various historically interesting places in the Isle of Thanet, such as Richborough Castle (which formerly guarded the eastern entrance to the vanished estuary of the Wantsome), Reculvers, Broadstairs, the North Foreland, Sandgate and Deal. Excellent fishing too may be had in the Downs \u2014 whiting, codlings and flat fish, while trout may be taken in the River Stour close by. The Downs are full of historical reminiscences dating from the earliest times. Here C\u00e6sar anchored when he invaded our island, landing his forces in the neighbourhood of Deal. Here too many stubborn contests were fought between the English and the Danes, in days prior to the Norman Conquest. It was in the Downs, that the earliest recorded naval figh between our forefathers, under Hubert de Burgh, and the French was fought in the year 1215, the French being com pletely vanquished. In the same place, two years afterwards, the contest was renewed with a like result, but not until a portion of the French fleet had landed and burned Sandwich. Henry VIII. sailed from the Downs in 1513, for the invasion of France, with 400 ships. What a picturesque and curious sight must this immense fleet, with their quaint high and embattled sterns, have presented ; how different to the low, squat ironclads of modern times !"], [45, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 31 But above all, it was in Calais Roads, not far from the southern entrance to the Downs that the final action was fought with the great Armada, which had dropped anchor there. The English attacked the Spaniards with fire ships, and during the confusion fell upon them with great fury, so that after a fight of fourteen hours duration, the Spanish Commander was obliged to order that disastrous retreat northwards which ended in the almost complete destruction of his fleet. As the medal struck by Elizabeth has it, \"afflavit Dens et dissipantur.\" Altogether, by \"battle and the breeze,\" the Spaniards lost 81 ships and 13,500 men. In 1648, Deal was attacked by Prince Charles, but he was repulsed ; and four years later a great but drawn battle took place here, between the Dutch under Van Tromp, and the English under Blake. Subsequently, in another contest off Dungeness, the Dutch Admiral was defeated, and the greater part of his fleet destroyed. This did not, however, prevent the gallant Dutchman trying his fortune again ; for, in May of the next year, we find that his fleet of 100 vessels, encountered the English fleet to the north of the Goodwins, but after a battle of two days duration he was finally defeated, with the loss of 13 ships, and 3,500 men killed and prisoners. Such good luck did not, however, always attend our arms in the Downs, for in 1706, an English squadron of eight vessels convoying a fleet of 55 merchantmen, was attacked by a French fleet of fifteen sail, with the result that two of our men-of-war, and half the merchant vessels, were taken by the enemy. Perhaps, the most interesting matter in connection with this locality, to a person of nautical tastes, is the dreaded shoal called the Goodwin Sands, which lies about four miles east of Ramsgate, and thence stretches down the coast as far as Walmer, a distance of over ten miles. A glance at the annual wreck chart, will show, that there are more marine casualties between Dungeness and the North Foreland, than on any other part of the coast of the United Kingdom. This, no doubt is mainly due, to the congestion of traffic in this particular locality, but the Goodwins are responsible for a heavy annual loss, both of life, and property."], [46, "32 RAMSGATE TO DOVER. A large area of this shoal, dries at low water for about three hours, the exposed portions extending in detached islets, for a distance of well-nigh seven miles in length, by three and a half in width, and being elevated about four feet, above the surface of the sea. At high water, however, the entire sand is covered to a depth of some ten or twelve feet. There appears to be good reason for supposing that, prior to the Conquest, the Goodwin Sands formed an island, frequently spoken of in ancient literature as the Isle of Lomea, which belonged to the celebrated Earl Goodwin, and that by some convulsion of nature, similar to, or perhaps identical, with that which destroyed the estuary of the Wantsome, this island was submerged. Mr. Geo. Byng Gattie, in his interesting \" Memorials of the Goodwin Sands,\"* says : \u2014 \" A careful study of the whole question in all its bearings, geographical, geological, and historical, will leave little doubt that the sands were once, as recorded, the Island of Lomea, but submerged in one of the severe convulsions, or earthquakes, mentioned in Belgic as well as British history and handed down by tradition. It is quite certain that changes of a most extraordinary nature have taken place at very remote periods, long prior to the destruction of the island (a.d. 1099) ; . . . and it is an historical fact, asserted by Tacitus and Antoninus, that oysters were found in the levels of the estuary at Rutupinm (Richborough) where C\u00e6sar anchored his fleet, and these are now covered by nineteen feet of dry land. All this would point to sudden eruption by tempest or earthquake rather than by general or gradual deposition.\" It is, however, a somewhat strange fact that, since the end of the eleventh century, the Goodwins have been submerged, while the adjacent East Kentish coast has undoubtedly gained upon the sea, so that Sandwich, which was then a seaport town, is now no less than two miles from the water. It is said, that this latter phenomenon is owing to a vessel having been sunk in the mouth of Sandwich Haven, by which the flow of the tide was choked ; but. however it happened, the fact remains, that the sea has conquered the land off Margate *AHan & Co., Waterloo Place, 1890."], [47, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 33 and Reculvers and at the Goodwins, whereas the land has vanquished the water along the shores of Pegwell Bay. The Goodwins have an evil name among seamen, having been the scene of innumerable wrecks. Perhaps the most terrible of these was the wreck of Rear- Admiral Beaumont's fleet, which lay at anchor in the Downs, in the great storm of 1703. The whole of the thirteen ships of war constituting this fleet, were totally wrecked, some on the Goodwins, some on the coast of the mainland, while others, curiously enough, sank at their moorings. In all, 1,200 officers and men perished. This was the same gale which swept away Winstanley's first Eddystone lighthouse along with its designer, who had some what boastfully expressed a wish that he might be in it \"during the greatest storm that could blow under the face of heaven.\" His wish was gratified, to his own destruction. The Rev. John Gilmore, in his eloquent and interesting work \" Storm Warriors,\" gives several accounts of wrecks on the Sands, and of the heroism of the Deal and Ramsgate boatmen in rescuing, or attempting the rescue of, the unfor tunate crews. The boatmen of the Downs are indeed extremely fine and bold fellows, who devote themselves almost entirely to salvage work and pilotage, and consequently their lives are highly adventurous and picturesque. In easterly and south-easterly gales, a very heavy sea breaks on the Sands, and woe betide the ship which then goes ashore there ; for the rollers soon bump her to pieces, and more than one large vessel has been known to break up and disappear before lifeboat or lugger could reach her. The Sands may be visited near low water, but the services of a local man should be engaged, as the excursion is by no means free from danger. The pilotage from Ramsgate to Dover is not free from difficulty. The yachtsman has the choice of two routes. He may either leave by the way he came, viz., through the old Cudd channel, and thence by way of the Gull Stream (the wide passage or channel between the Goodwins and the Brake Sand), or he may prefer to use the narrow channel (scarcely half a mile wide) between the Brake Sand and the Kentish c"], [48, "RAMSGATE TO DOVER. 34 shore, which is called Ramsgate Channel. Let us choose the Gull Stream.* The vessel is therefore navigated through the old Cudd, between the two buoys described in the last chapter, which lie S.E. by E. | E. from the south-east pier head. Having passed between them, we must observe the following direc tions : \u2014 (i) Stand on E.S.E. one mile, until the North Brake buoy (black and white vertical stripes) is reached. (2) Pass to the northward of this, and the course is then S.S.W., leaving the black and white buoys of the Brake Sand to westward, and the black buoys of the Goodwins to the eastward. The Gull lightship may be passed on either side, as it lies in mid-channel. In beating to windward, do not approach the Goodwins so as to bring any of the Goodwin buoys which lie south, or ahead of yon, to the westward of S. W . ; and, until past the Gull lightship, it is a good and safe rule to keep it well to seaward of Deal pier, or at night do not get it much inland of the South Foreland high light. On the other hand, do not (until past the South Brake buoy) approach the Brake Sand so as to bring the Brake buoy, which is next ahead of you, more than half way from the South Foreland, and towards the South Sand Head lightship. (3) When past the Gull, and opposite the South Brake buoy (black and white horizontal stripes with staff and cross), the channel narrows to one mile, being bounded on the opposite side by a black buoy labelled N. W. Bunt. After passing these two buoys, the passage widens very greatly (as Bunt Head shoal in mid-channel has over twenty feet on it), and so long as the S.W. Goodwin buoy is not brought W. of S.W., the yacht will be in no danger from the Goodwins, and the coast of Kent can be approached to within half a mile, from Deal right away to Dover. So much for the Gull Stream. If, however, at any time you should elect to try the channel inside the Brake (called Ramsgate Channel), which I should only advise you to do if you have a leading wind, the courses are as follows : \u2014 * The Gull Stream, being so much wider than Ramsgate Channel, is far the safer, particularly if a beat to windward is necessary."], [49, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 35 (i) From the harbour mouth, steer S.W. by S. for two miles, until the fairway buoy is reached (red and white chequered). (2) Leave this to the westward, and steer due south, passing to the eastward of the south fairway buoy (red and white vertical stripes). (3) Then steer S. by W. for Deal buoy, whence the direc tions are the same as those given for navigating the Gull Stream. (4) At night, keep the lights on Ramsgate pier head N.N.E., and that will take you through the Channel in not less than seven feet L.W.S., or, if the red light is shown on Ramsgate pier, in not less than twelve feet. If this water is too little for your vessel, you must consult one of the recognised pilot books. Dover has a good tidal harbour, with two large floating basins. Some yachts bring up in the roadstead called Dover Wick, opposite the Royal Cinque Ports Yacht Club, in seven fathoms. There is, however, pretty generally, a nasty roll here, even in calm weather with an off-shore wind, and most yachtsmen will prefer to go into the Gran ville Dock, which is clean and sweet, and if one does not make fast along the west side, it is quite private there. The gates of the dock are open for about one and a half hours before, to one and a half hours after high water, but they are sometimes closed earlier, so do not delay getting in. There are red lights on each of the piers leading into the harbour when there is over seven feet at the entrance, and a green light on the Granville Dock entrance behind them. In entering at night, keep this green light between the two red ones. When there is over seven feet at the entrance, a red flag is shewn, with a ball below it ; when there is over ten feet the ball is removed ; when over thirteen feet the ball is placed above the flag. At night, when there is over ten feet of water, three red lights are shewn on the south pier instead of one. To enter the harbour, steer right between the pier heads, and make fast to one of the numerous mooring buoys while"], [50, "36 RAMSGATE TO DOVER you stow your canvas.

DOVER TO NEWHAVEN ' The narrow seas that part The French and English.\" Merch. of Ven., I. 8. THE situation of Dover in relation to the Continent must have rendered it a post of the greatest consequence, even from the earliest periods of our history ; and indeed Matthew Paris speaks of it (circa 1230) as the key and barrier of the kingdom (clavis et repagulum totius regni). Sir Walter Raleigh also said of it, \" No promontory, town or haven in Christendom is so placed by nature and situation, both to gratify friends and annoy enemies, as this town of Dover.\" Whether that is the case now, however, may be well doubted ; at all events the authorities have not deemed it necessary to fortify the place to anything like the same extent as Plymouth or the entrances to the Solent. It is believed that Dover Castle stands upon the site of a British hill fortress, dating long previous to the Roman occupation. However that may be, the ancient and interesting Pharos or lighthouse on Castle Hill is unquestionably of Roman origin. Latin writers refer to the town as Portum Dubris, but in its English form the name is believed to be derived from the British word \" Dwfyrrha,\" signifying a steep place. The Saxons, who built a church on Castle Hill, (the remains of which can still be seen) called it Dorfa, and in the Doomsday Book it appears as Dovere. One of the early governors of Dover Castle was the great Earl Goodwin, in the reign of Edward the Confessor, and the celebrated quarrel between him and the king arose out of his curt refusal to punish the townsmen of Dover for an assault on some insolent followers of the king's brother-in-law, Eustace Earl of Boulogne. This so incensed Edward that he attacked Goodwin, who was obliged to fly the kingdom. Having, how ever, obtained an accession of strength, the Earl returned,"], [54, "38 DOVER TO NEWHAVEN. and so overawed the Confessor that on a merely nominal submission he was reinstated in all his estates and honours. On the arrival of William the Conqueror, Dover was burnt by him. This is recorded in Doomsday \" in ipso primo adventu ejus in Angliam suit ipsa villa combusta.\" Shortly afterwards the townsmen, with the aid of Eustace of Boulogne, attempted to take the castle by a night surprise. As Lambard quaintly says, however, in his \" Perambulation- of Kent,\" \" by reason that the watch descried them, they not only fayled of that whiche they intended, but also fell into that whiche they never feared ; for the souldiours within the castell kept themselves close, and suffered the assaylants to approache the wall, and then, whiles they disorderly attempted to scale it, they set wide open their gates, and made a soudaine salie out of the place, and set upon them with such fury, that they compelled Eustace, with a few others, to returne to his shippe, the rest of his companions being eyther slayne by the sworde, destroyed by fall from the cliffs, or devoured by the sea.\"* The Castle was twice besieged by the Dauphin in the reign of John, but he was successfully resisted by Hubert de Burgh, the Governor. In the time of the Commonwealth, the Castle fell into the hands of the Parliamentary part}* in a manner which is almost incredible, but which yet appears to be well authenticated. A merchant named Drake had the temerity to attempt the seizure of the fortress with the aid of only twelve men. By means of ropes and ladders, this forlorn hope managed, one night, to scale the seaward front, which being considered inaccessible had been left unguarded. They here seized the sentinel, and threw open the gates. The officer in command, deceived by their boldness, and supposing that they were accompanied by a large force, surrendered at discretion ; and before any attempt could be made to retake the place, a sufficient number of troops to hold it were sent from Canter bury by the Parliamentary general, The scenery of Dover is exceedingly fine, situated as it is in a deep valley formed by a depression in the chalk hills, which tower on either side in the great white cliffs from which * Perambulation of Kent, p. 122, Ed. 1576."], [55, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 39 the name Albion is said to be derived. Those on the north east constitute the headland known as the South Foreland, while on the south west is seen, sharply outlined against the sky, \" the dread summit of that chalky bourn,\" the precipitous heights of which are described in such magnificent language in \" King Lear \" : \u2014 \" How fearful And dizzy 'tis to cast ones eyes so low! The crows, and choughs, that wing the midway air, Show scarce so gross as beetles ; half way down Hangs one that gathers samphire ; dreadful trade ! Methinks he seems no bigger than his head ; The fishermen that walk upon the beach Appear like mice ; and yon tall anchoring bark, Diminished to her cock ; her cock a buoy Almost too small for sight : the murmuring surge. That on the unnumbered idle pebbles chafes, Cannot be heard so high : I'll look no more ; Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight Topple down headlong.\" The ancient castle is situated on the eastern heights 300 feet above the sea, and greatly adds to the landscape on that side. Its towers are numerous, and some of them of Norman architecture. Leave to visit it, and the armoury, may be obtained from the Commissary General, at Ordnance House, and many objects of interest are on view there. The venerable Pharos is probably the most ancient Roman work in England, and is alone worth a climb up to the castle, while \" Queen Elizabeth's pocket pistol\" is a fine specimen of 16th century ordnance. There are also the remains of an exceed ingly ancient Saxon Church, of considerable interest to antiquarians. The harbour of Dover has always been a costly and difficult one to preserve. The prevailing south westerly winds have from time to time blocked up the port by a bar, through which the pent up waters have kept open a narrow and variable channel. Various attempts to preserve the harbour were made in ancient times. Even in Doomsday Book it is mentioned that, at the entrance of the port, was a mill, which caused damage to almost every ship from the great agitation of the water. In the reign of the seventh Henry a round"], [56, "40 DOVER TO NEWHAVEN. tower was built on its S.W. side to protect the shipping from the violence of the prevailing wind. To this, vessels are said to have been moored by rings, and it made the haven so snug that it was called '\u2022 Little Paradise.\"* This old harbour is now however filled in, and its site is occupied by the street called Round Tower Street. Sir Jno. Thompson, in the reign of Henry VIII., enclosed a small basin with a quay, by driving piles into the chalk and filling in the interstices with blocks of stone. The sea, however, made short work of this, and the bar accumulated, so that boats drawing four feet of water could scarcely enter the port. Foreign engineers of eminence were then called in, and, after divers failures, a secure haven was formed, with twenty-two feet at high water spring tides. The harbour has, however, always been in danger of silting up, and the best means of improving it has formed the subject of repeated reports from some of the most eminent engineers. The Admiralty Pier, to the west of the harbour, was commenced as a harbour of refuge, but although it has cost considerably over and no doubt protects a considerable area from westerly gales, it leaves much to be desired, and it may be hoped that the Government will at no distant date realize the great advantage, both to national defence and commerce, of an extension of the Admiralty Pier so as to enclose Dover Bay. Sailing from Dover to the westward, the first practically available harbour for a yacht, is Newhaven, distant 58 miles, as Folkestone and Rye are both unsuited to yachts. To reach Newhaven, two points have to be rounded, viz., Dungeness and Beachy Head ; but, except for the very moderate \"race\" tides which are found off them, they present no difficulties, and indeed the entire passage is perfectly simple and free from rocks or banks dangerous to vessels drawning less than eleven feet. Starting from Dover, one passes Folkestone, Hythe, Sand gate (where the Benvenue was so lately wrecked) and Shorncliffe. After that, the shore becomes low, forming the * Beauties of England and Wales."], [57, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 41 curious district known as Romney Marsh, extending from Hythe to Winchelsea. This large tract is quite flat, and lies throughout below the sea level, being held from the sea by a continuous wall or bank, on which the preservation of the district depends. The marsh is so isolated, that its inhabitants say that the world is divided into Europe, Asia, Africa, America, and Romney Marsh. Although absolutely devoid of scenery or even trees, Romney Marsh is interesting as an example of what the ancient engineers could do in the way of reclamation, as the greater part of its embankments are prehistoric and supposed to be due to the Frisians. Great additions have, however, been made to the marsh in modern times, the marshmen taking every opportunity of pushing back the waters of the sea, so that Old Romney and Winchelsea (formerly ports of importance) are now a long distance inland, and Rye is rapidly following in their footsteps, while Dungeness, in the middle of the coa_.tline, still gains accumulations of shingles so rapidly, that it is said to have extended upwards of a mile within the last hundred years. Past Winchelsea, the coast becomes higher, and so continues until Hastings and St. Leonards are passed, midway between imngeness and Beachy Head. After that, the coast again becomes low about Pevensey Bay, but, as we proceed, Eastbourne conies into view, nestling under the shadow of the majestic Beachy Head. In north westerly settled summer weather, the roadstead of Eastbourne affords quiet anchorage for a few hours ; but it is a nasty place to be caught in in a westerly gale, as there is no refuge nearer than Dover, over 40 miles distant. Beachy Head being rounded, Seaford Head comes into view, looking like an island, and about two miles beyond, and lying between it and Burrow Head, is Newhaven. The pilot age from Dover to Newhaven presents no difficulty. The following courses lead free of all the few dangers that there are : \u2014 (1) Dover Pier to two miles outside Dungeness, S.W. by W.

In beating to windward between Dover and Dungeness, the only dangers are, (i) the Roar Bank, with ten feet on it, between Dymchurch and New Romney, and lying about two miles from the shore; and (2) the Varne and Ridge shoals lying about midway between England and France, with six to seven feet on parts of them. To avoid the Roar, do not shoal to less than five fathoms as you approach the land, and do not bring Dungeness light houses S. of S.W. At night, tack when Dungeness high light turns from white to red. To avoid the Varne and Ridge, do not bring the Varne lightship (red revolving every twenty seconds) W. of S.W., or N. of N.E. by N. (2) Two miles outside Dungeness (the lighthouses bearing N.N.W.), to midway between Royal Sovereign light vessel (three flashes every minute, visible ten miles) and Royal Sovereign buoy (black and white vertical stripes, with staff and cage), the course is W. | S. 24^ miles. The Royal Sovereign shoal is a small patch, having nine feet least water on it, situated five miles E.S.E. f S. of Eastbourne. The buoy is placed close to the south side of the shoal, and the lightship about two miles south of it. If you desire to do so, instead of making the above course across the bay, you may safely steer along the shore at a distance of a mile and a half. the whole way from Dungeness to Beachy Head. In beating to windward between Dungeness and Beachy Head, you may safely approach the shore to a distance of a mile and a half. There are no dangers to seaward, and the only shoal to be avoided by yachts drawing less than twelve feet is the Royal Sovereign. At night, in approaching the land, tack when the Dungeness high light turns from white to red. (3) From midway between the Lightship and buoy marking the Royal Sovereign, to opposite Beachy Head light house, the course is W. by N. 8^ miles, the lighthouse bearing N.N.E. l N., i\u00a3 miles distant. Beating to windward, when approaching Beachy Head, do not bring the Royal Sovereign lightship south of E.S.E. (4) Thence the course to Seaford Head is N.W. five miles, right along the coast line, which may be approached to less than a mile in not less than five fathoms."], [59, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 43 (5) From Seaford Head to Newhaven breakwater, the course is N.N.W. W. i\\ miles, in not less than five fathoms until Seaford village is passed, and then in not less than three until the red buoy off the breakwater is reached. (6) A stranger should not attempt Newhaven without a pilot between half-ebb and half-flood, as it is a tidal harbour. Although dredgers are said to keep a channel of twelve feet at low water spring tides, between the harbour and the breakwater head the channel is narrow and is not buoyed. At half-tide, however, there will be at least twelve feet over a very considerable breadth, and whenever there is more than eight feet, a black ball is hoisted on a flagstaff; when more than ten, two black balls; when more than thirteen, a red flag ; and when more than fifteen, a red flag and black ball. With a leading wind, bring the piers north and steer straight in. If you have to beat, take short boards across the north bearing, keeping the lead going When inside, you must take up a berth against the mooring posts on the west side, well up the harbour. At night (in addition to the breakwater winking light) a white fixed light is shewn on the east pier ; and on the west pier a tide light is shewn, viz., green when there is less than ten feet, red when there is more than ten and less than fourteen, and white if over fourteen.

As the water begins to rise at Dover the two streams meet off Beachy Head, but again the point of meeting moves eastward until it is off Dover at H.W. there. It is therefore wise to start from Dover about four hours after high water, i.e., with the first of the western stream. By so doing you will carry three hours tide as far as Beachy Head, a four hours tide as far as Hastings, and a five hours tide as far as Rye. As it is next to impossible (except for a fast steamer) to reach Beachy Head in three hours (in which case you might take on the main channel ebb for six hours) , you will have somewhere or other to encounter an adverse tide of six hours duration. In coming up channel, however, the case is different, and if you can get to Beachy Head an hour or so before high water time at Dover, you will carry a six hours tide with you right up Channel. If, however, you only arrive at the Head at high water Dover, then, although you will have caught the east going tide through Dover Strait, yet as the line of division moves eastward faster than your vessel is likely to travel, you will almost certainly be left behind."], [61, ""], [62, ""], [63, "CHAPTER X.

A'eale. rr,HERE is nothing very interesting about Newhaven, J except the harbour and breakwater, great engineering works which have taken many years to construct, at an expenditure of considerably over half a million sterling. The breakwater, only completed in 1890, measures half a mile in length, and bears at its seaward end a fine lighthouse of stone. To the east of Newhaven is Seaford Bay, across which we passed on our passage from Dover. It is a deep bay, sur rounded by cliffs of great height, which render it an excellent roadstead in easterly winds. Its lofty surroundings, forming the first of the nine headlands which terminate in Beachy Head, are a grand landmark for mariners proceeding up channel from the west, as it is the first bit of high land between here and the Isle of Wight. The yachtsman proceeding down Channel from Newhaven, should, as a general rule, make Portsmouth, or some other harbour inside the Solent, his objective point. No doubt Shoreham is available as a half-way house, and, by small vessels, (especially those which can take the ground) Little hampton may be visited ; but neither of these ports can be recommended, and the distance from Newhaven to Portsmouth being little over forty-five miles, is but a nice day's sail. Moreover, this is the dreariest and ugliest bit of the whole Channel, and the sooner one gets past it the better. As, however, I am taking my readers down the coast, we will make three trips of it, and spend a night at both these places. Leaving Newhaven then, for Shoreham, we skirt the coast at the distance of about a mile, as there are no hidden dangers. Passing Rottingdean, the vessel soon approaches Brighton, that \" London by the Sea,\" which lies only 8\u00a3 miles west of"], [64, "46 NEWHAVEN TO PORTSMOUTH. Newhaven. I have heard it said by travellers of experience, that the appearance of Brighton from the deck of an Orient liner, even at a distance of several miles, has curbed the bragging tongue of many an Australian-born youngster, coming to England for the first time, and labouring under the impression that Melbourne or Sydney are giants compared to the towns of the old country. Whether this be so or not, there can be no doubt that Brighton presents a very imposing appearance from a yacht passing within a mile or two of its beach. Its two chain piers, its great buildings, its numerous churches, but above all the long line of houses, extending from near Shoreham as far as Kemp Town, give it all the appearance of an immense city. After passing the two suspension piers, the entrance to Shoreham (situated about four miles beyond the Grand Hotel) soon comes into view. This harbour is formed by the river Adur, which flows into the sea between two stone piers 176 feet apart. Between, and at the extreme shore end of these, a middle wedge-shaped pier divides the harbour into two branches, of which the western one is the natural channel of the river, while the eastern one is partly artificial, and partly the ancient bed of the stream before it was diverted into its present exit. Vessels of seven feet draught can, it is said, lie afloat at L.W.S. in the western arm ; and those of sixteen feet can do so by passing through the lock into the canal basin in the eastern arm. At neap tides, a yacht, not exceeding ten feet draft, can lie comfortably in the western arm. The Churches, both at New and Old Shoreham, are ancient and interesting, and will well repay a visit The pilotage from Newhaven to Shoreham presents but little difficulty. From a mile outside Newhaven break water, we steer N.W. by W. \\ W., 12^ miles, so as to avoid the Jenyground Rocks, which lie midway between Brighton and Shoreham, with only four or five feet on them at low water. The harbour mouth at length bears N.N.W., and the course is at once altered, and our bowsprit pointed right between the piers, as the signal informs us that there is enough water at the entrance. There is an elaborate code of signals"], [65, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 47 used at Shoreham to indicate the depth of water, which will be found in any of the recognized pilot books. For the present purpose it is sufficient to say that, with a flowing tide two or three balls at the mast head on the middle pier, indicate eight or nine feet ; one, two, or three at the outer yard arm indicate ten, eleven, or twelve feet, while balls at the inner yard arm, or one on each yard arm, indicate thirteen to sixteen feet. If the tide is ebbing, a pendant at the mast head, with balls there, indicates that there is between sixteen and fifteen feet; if the balls are on the outer yard arm, the depth is between fifteen and twelve feet ; if at the inner yard arm, the depth is between twelve and nine feet. When the pennant is hoisted at the outer yard arm, there is only eight feet, and if a ball is below it, the bar is impassable.* Leaving Shoreham for Littlehampton. we must make an offing of two miles in order to miss the Grass Bank, situated between Shoreham and Worthing, which projects pretty nigh one and a half miles from the shore, and has no more than nine feet on it. To avoid this, we must keep the vessel's head VV.S.W. until Worthing Pier bears N., then we port a little, and keep her W. by N. until abreast Littlehampton. This will take us clear of Kingston Rock, with only one and a half fathoms on it, lying a mile from the shore, about midway between Worthing and Littlehampton, and right off Kingston village. Here, out of \" abundance of caution,\" we keep the lead going, and take care not to shoal to anything less than three fathoms. As the bar at Littlehampton has scarcely more than a foot on it at L.W.S., we hoist our \" Pilot Jack,\" and the pilot will not only shew us the way in, but take the vessel to some spot where she can lie afloat. The depth at high water springs is over sixteen feet, and at neaps twelve, so that at half tide there is not more than seven feet. At spring tides, it is doubtful whether any vessel, whose draft exceeds six feet, could lie afloat below the station; but at neaps, it is believed that there is about nine feet at low water in the harbour. * There are also other signals, but as they are mainly intended for large merchant vessels, the reader is referred to King's, or Imray's Channel Pilot, where they are set forth at length."], [66, "48 NEWHAVEN TO PORTSMOUTH. I, therefore, strongly advise all yachtsmen not to choose the full or new time of the moon for a visit to this haven, more particularly as at these periods the tide runs excessively fast ; and if ever you should be tempted to enter without a pilot, remember that the tide outside crosses the harbour mouth, flowing west from half flood to half ebb, and east from half ebb to half flood. Littlehampton is a watering place of some importance, and the owner of a vessel capable of lying afloat there, may well pass a few days in investigating the place and its surrounding country. The River Arun is navigable at all times of the tide as far as Arundel, having a depth varying between three feet and ten feet all the way. Indeed, the river is far deeper between Arundel and Littlehampton than it is between the latter place and the sea. So far as I know, there is no reason why a yacht of moderate draft should not be towed up to Arundel (which lies between four or five miles above Littlehampton town), but, of course, the river is very narrow there, probably not more than thirty-five yards across, so that it would be necessary to moor alongside the bank. Anyhow, even if the yacht be not taken up the river, an excursion should be made in the gig or dingey as far as Arundel Castle, the seat of the Duke of Norfolk, a place of surpassing beauty and world-wide reputation. Leaving Littlehampton with any south in the wind, practically means towing out, as the channel is too narrow for beating. We accordingly make an arrangement with the local tug to take us half a mile past the lighthouse, where we ought to find over five fathoms. From there we have a choice of routes into the Solent, viz., (1) outside the Owers shoal, or (2) inside the shoal by way of the narrow channel called the Looe stream. The outside course is the safer, but the inside one is the shorter by about four miles, and in fair weather, with a favourable tide, is safe enough. If, however- the sea be at all rough, particularly at springs, the Looe cannot be recom mended, as there are turbulent overfalls at its western end, and the passage there is so narrow, that if command of the vessel -were lost for a few minutes, she might drive ashore with disastrous consequences. ' ......."], [67, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 49 The Owers shoal is, in truth, one of the worst dangers in the Channel, projecting as it does a good five miles south of Selsey Bill. The Looe is the passage running between the shoals off the Bill, and the Owers ; and three and a half to six fathoms will be found right through it. A lightship, showing a flashing light every half minute, (two white flashes and one red), is moored about half a mile south of the outer Owers, which is the most dangerous part of the shoal, having scarcely three feet on it at low water. This shallow spot is known as \" the shoal of the lead,\" and it is said that the worst breakers in the Channel are to be found on it in southerly and westerly gales. There can be little doubt that the Owers formerly formed part of the adjacent coast. A monastery, dedicated to St. Peter, and an adjoining town, once stood on the south-east of the Bill, the remains of which were, according to Camden. visible at low water in his time ; while the author of the \" Beauties of England and Wales,\" writing in the early part of the present century, says that about a mile and a half out at sea, there were several places where the ruins of buildings could be seen beneath the waves. The best anchorage is to this day called \" the park,\" and the rocks between the Bill and the shoals further out, bear the name of \" the streets,\" and here a tombstone with an inscription was found by a fisherman in the latter part of last century. The day being fine, and the wind south-easterly, we decide to proceed to the Nab by way of the Looe stream, and accordingly point the little vessel's head W.S.W.* After a pleasant sail of ten miles we find ourselves well into the mouth of the Looe, about midway between the Mixon beacon, off the Bill, and the black and white chequered buoy marking the northern edge of the Middle Owers, these marks being about two miles apart. When on the line joining them, and about midway between them, we port our helm, and steer W. by N. \u00a3 N., for the black and white vertically striped buoy with * I am aware that the correct magnetic course is f W. of that given, but my experience is, that there is a strong indraft hereabouts, and a skipper who steers the correct course is likely to find himself sailing directly on to Selsey Bill. When the lightship comes into sight, it will soon be seen whether the course is too southerly. D"], [68, "50 NEWHAVEN TO PORTSMOUTH. staff and cage, distant two miles away. This we pass close on the north side, steering between it and the black buoy moored about a mile N.N.E. of it, and through this narrow and some times turbulent gateway, we emerge from the Looe into the main channel again, and steer N.W. by W. f W., for the Nab lightship, distant about six miles. The entrance to Portsmouth may, from the pilot's point of view, be considered to commence at the Nab lightship, which lies about the middle of the mouth of the channel. The northern and eastern shore of the channel is encumbered by the great shoal called the Horse Sand, commencing about one and a half miles N.N.W. of the Nab, running thence along a line, marked by black buoys, to the Horse Fort (the middle one of the three round forts), and thence in a fairly straight line to Southsea Castle. The southern and western side of the channel is bounded by shoals, commencing at Bembridge Ledge (marked by a black and white chequered buoy, bearing W. by S. from the Nab), and running thence to the Noman Fort (the southernmost of the three). From there, the channel to the westward into the Solent is quite clear, as far as to the outer spit buoy, lying N.N.E. from the Noman Fort, after which Gilkicker Sand renders the channel very narrow, until the actual entrance of the harbour. As our boat, like Iago's, still \"sails freely both with wind and stream,\" we can make a direct course from the Nab to the Warner lightship and the Horse Fort, passing about one hundred yards or so to the southward of the latter. Thence we make a little to the west of Southsea Castle, on a north bearing, leaving the refuge buoy off the Spit Fort to the west ward, and enter the channel to the harbour, which is so prodigally marked with large black buoys to the eastward, and black and white ones to the westward, that you could scarcely make a mistake if you tried. Had the wind been foul when nearing the Nab, it would have been necessary to avoid approaching the Island shoal nearer than a line joining the Noman Fort and Haslar Hospital. The Horse Sand, as far as the Horse Fort, would have been avoided by keeping the Spit Fort open westward of the Horse Fort. After that, we should have kept in the channel, so long as Southsea Castle did"], [69, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 51 not bear east of north, and we did not cross the line joining that castle and the Horse Fort. Gilkicker Sand is only dangerous to yachts between the refuge buoy off the Spit Fort, and the harbour mouth. The latter part is so well marked by the before-mentioned black and white buoys, that no mistake can be made ; and up to the first of these buoys a yacht will be in not less than two fathoms if it does not cross the line when the Spit Fort and the Noman Fort are in one. Having caught the flood tide into Portsmouth, we fly through the narrow entrance, past the stately old three-deckers which lie off Gosport, and the great modern troopships and iron clads which are moored along the eastern quays, until we come to the quaint old yacht of George III., which is moored opposite to the navy building yards at Portsea. Here we drop our hook for the night, in a quiet corner of the harbour, where we are not likely to be run down by any of the numerous steamers which are buzzing about lower down. Some people of festive disposition would, I know, consider this spot dismal and lonely, and such persons must bring up in the crowd, close to the landing place of the steam ferry at Gosport, where they will get plenty of society and noise, to say nothing of plenty of bumping from other craft. A very favourite anchorage with many, is outside Ports mouth, off Southsea pier. If the wind is anywhere between east round by north to north-west, this would be a comfortable berth enough, but for the numerous steamers plying between Portsmouth and the island. These large and powerful boats however, keep the water in a perpetual bobble, and the smoke emitted by them is also a considerable nuisance. Still, many people of a gay disposition like to bring up at this spot, which is full of life, movement, and gaiety, owing to the proximity of Southsea pier. Portsmouth, at neaps, is perhaps the most comfortable harbour in the Channel, because no sea can ever get through its narrow entrance. At spring tides, however, the stream runs very stiff, and at such times, if the weather happens to be coarse, a yacht is very apt to drag. Another objection to Portsmouth is, that it is thickly strewn with moorings, so that"], [70, "52 NEWHAVEN TO PORTSMOUTH. one is very apt to lose, or at all events have great difficulty in getting, one's anchor. Portsmouth is, as is well known, our greatest naval arsenal, and as such is necessarily a strongly fortified place. The eastern channel is defended by the circular iron forts on the Spit Sand, the Horse, and the Noman ; while the western entrance at the Needles, is even more strongly armed by means of great earthworks on the Isle of Wight, and the large casemated fort at Hurst Point. Nor are landward defences forgotten, for several strong detached works are erected on the Portsdown Hills, while the inner face of the town is surrounded by a ditch and wall, with all the usual appendages. The present fortifications were commenced under the Palmerston administration, and have cost an immense sum of money. The chief sight of Portsmouth, or, to be more correct, of Portsmouth harbour, is undoubtedly the naval dockyard at Portsea, 300 acres in extent, to which persons of British nationality are admitted every week-day except Saturday, between the hours of 10 and 12 a.m. and 1*15 and 3 p.m. Here may be seen our monstrous ironclads in every stage of development, from the new-laid keel, to the complete and complex fighting machine which we call an armoured battle ship. A visit to the dockyard should certainly be made before we quit the harbour. To those who like to realise historic incidents, by viewing the spots where they occurred, a visit to No. 12, High Street, Portsmouth, is recommended. Here, formerly, stood the Spotted Dog, where the great Duke of Buckingham was assassinated by Felton in 1628. The glorious old \"Victory,\" too, still lies in the harbour off the town, and many interesting reminiscences of Nelson and Trafalgar are preserved on board. Outside the harbour, between the Spit Fort and the Isle of Wight, is the roadstead of Spithead, the usual anchorage for men-of-war before entering the harbour. Here, in 1545, was fought a two days drawn battle between the English and French fleets, in the course of which one of our battle ships, the Mary Rose, capsized with 600 men, the majority of whom were drowned. Nor is this our only naval disaster at Spithead, for, nearly two centuries and a half later, in 1782, the Royal"], [71, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 53 George, while being heeled over, in order to make good some defect beneath the water line, was allowed to pass her angle of maximum stability, with the result that she was thrown on her beam ends, and sank, carrying with her Admiral Kempenfelt, and over one thousand men, women, and children. The Portsmouth people have lately considerably beautified their historic borough, by the erection of an exceptionally handsome town hall, and by the laying out of public gardens. On the Gosport side of the harbour, there are good shops, and the yachting yard of Messrs. Camper and Nicholson, which cannot fail to be interesting to those for whom this book is written. Haslar hospital also lies on this side of the harbour, but I believe it is not open to the general public. Southsea, lying to the east of Portsmouth, is the fashionable part ; and Southsea pier with its band, and the common, beach and promenade, leading up to the castle, are generally gay and brilliant, on a fine summer afternoon, with \" fair women and brave men ;\" while the sea off the beach is crowded with row boats, manned, or I should perhaps say womaned, by beautiful damsels, perfect in every art, except that of keeping clear of vessels under weigh. In short, a few days may very profitably and pleasurably be spent at Portsmouth or South sea. NOTES ON PILOTAGE. (i.) Magnetic Courses and Distances. Newhaven to Owers lightship, W. J N., 29 miles.

The main channel tide between Newhaven and Portland, practically changes with the time of high and low water at Dover, flowing eastward while the water is rising at Dover, and westward while it is falling there. Inshore, however, the streams change from an hour to two hours earlier. Thus, through the Looe, the western stream makes at one hour before high water Dover, and the east stream at one hour and a quarter before low water Dover ; and at Spithead the west stream commences at two hours before Dover H.W., and runs for five hours only, the east stream commencing at nearly three hours before L.W. at Dover. Notwithstanding this, the water rises in Portsmouth Harbour (and therefore flows into it) until a good half hour after high water Dover, but only ebbs until half an"], [73, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 55 hour before low water Dover. In other words, the flood tide runs into the harbour for about seven hours instead of six, and ebbs for about five hours. This constitutes the phenomenon known as double high water. The net result is, that if you get to the Warner not later than the second hour of the inshore ebb there, you may expect to catch the last of the harbour flood, or if you use up the ebb just as you reach the Warner, you will catch the first of the seven hours flood into the harbour."], [74, "CHAPTER XI. THE WATERS OF THE WIGHT. ' I ken the Wight.\" Merry Wives of Windsor, I. 3. 'With ocean passed around it for its guard.\" Young. THE Isle of Wight is the acknowledged head quarters of English yachting ; and in truth, although the Solent, and its offshoot, Southampton Water, cannot be compared in point of beauty with the Devon and Cornish coasts, yet they have many quiet charms of their own ; so that even an old hand may pass a very pleasant week in their dirty green waters, pottering about between the Warner and the Needles, with an occasional trip round the island. If there be any south in the wind, and it is near spring tides, it will be advisable, if not necessary, to leave Portsmouth on the last of the ebb, (i.e., early in the morning, or late in the afternoon) otherwise there will be a difficulty in getting out, for the tide runs like a mill race at the entrance. Having got out, there are two channels into the Solent, viz., (1) round the Spit Fort, by the way we entered, and (2) through the swatchway or shallow channel which runs across the Gilkicker Sand. This, however, can only be safely used if you have a leading wind, and (having regard to your draft and the state of the tide) there is water enough in the swatch. At low water springs, there is one and a half fathoms least water in it, so, as it is neaps, and our draft is only nine feet, we will venture through. Accordingly, we proceed, as far as Southsea pier, along the Hampshire shore. Then, getting the two red and white beacon posts on Southsea common in line, we make a sharp turn to starboard, and steer towards Ryde, keeping the two beacons in line, until the Spit Fort is well abeam, when the shoal will have been left behind. Let us now run down to Ryde, distant about four miles from Portsmouth, and prettily situated on a hillside overtopped by the slender and conspicuous spire of Trinity Church."], [75, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 57 Ryde is a flourishing and agreeable watering place, with several good hotels (the Pier hotel is perhaps the best), and excellent shops, which are for the most part to be found in the steep Union Street, at the top of which is also erected a good sized theatre, where, from time to time, may be heard melo dramas of quite transpontine sensationalism. The pier is an excellent one, and an electric railway runs from the shore end to the pier head, for the accommodation of those who are indisposed or unable to walk. Altogether, Ryde is a very nice place, but if the wind be south-east, or anywhere between that and west round by the north, it is a roily berth to bring up at. For those who have the time and inclination, a very enjoyable way of investigating the Wight, is to take a carriage at the Pier hotel, and drive round the island. This takes three days, and costs as many guineas ; but it is well worth both the time and money. The first night is spent either at Bonchurch or the lovely little hotel at Niton, close to St. Catherine's point ; the second at Freshwater, or preferably at the Needles hotel ; and the third day one returns to Ryde via Carisbrooke and Cowes. Proceeding to the westward, past the quarantine hulk, we come to Fishbourne Creek, half a mile off which, in southerly and south-westerly winds, one may lie most comfortably in two fathoms. The creek can, and should, be entered in the dingey ; for the village is singularly picturesque, and a mile to the east of it, lie the remains of Quarr Abbey, which are interesting to the antiquary. The \" remains \" are, however, reduced to a minimum, and the investigator must not expect to see a magnificent, or indeed any ruin. In truth, all that is left of the abbey, now forms part of a farm house, barn, and other buildings. Among these, however, will be found some of the original arches, dating it is said from 1132, and a decorated doorway. Passing on across Osborne Bay, and skirting the northern edge of the Mother Bank (marked by red buoys), we approach the beautiful park of Osborne House, the residence of Her Majesty, with Norris Castle nestling beneath it ; and then a forest of tall and graceful masts right ahead, indicates that we are approaching the Metropolis of English yachting."], [76, "58 THE WATERS OF THE WIGHT. Cowes is situated on either bank of the river Medina, that portion which is on the Osborne side being called East Cowes, and that which lies on the other bank West Cowes, or more commonly \" Cowes \" only. Yachts do not, as a rule, enter the Medina, unless they are going to lay up or repair, but bring up just outside the bar, which stretches right away from Old Castle Point, on the east side of the entrance, three parts of the way across the mouth. A red and white chequered buoy is moored at the western extremity of the shoal, and must, of course, be left to the eastward. The western shore is fairly deep to within 150 yards, and a red buoy is moored off the flat on that side. Cowes is not a very interesting place in itself, but it contains some excellent shops, notably Pascall Atkey's, celebrated for all kinds of yacht fittings, and Simpson Benzies, equally noted for yachting jewellery. The renowned shipbuilding yard of Messrs. White is also here, and will of course be a place of interest to every true yachtsman. West Cowes Castle is the head-quarters of the R.Y.S., and a very stately club house it is. A few yards to the eastward of it, lies the plain and unpretentious habitation of the R.L.Y.C. Beyond the castle is the green, which forms an agreeable promenade, and it is at this end of the place that the better class of inhabitants reside. Leaving Cowes Road (which is a rather lumpy berth in winds with any north in them), let us make for Southampton Water. The approach to Southampton Water is encumbered by the shoals called the Bramble (which partly dries) and Thorn (with two and a half fathoms on it, and only dangerous to big vessels). These, together, form a submerged delta or island, on either side of which is a passage leading up to the entrance. The deepest water (four fathoms and upwards) is found on the west side of the shoal, and this is the channel used by large ships. The eastern channel has, however, two and a half fathoms and upwards, and is much used by yachts, especially those hailing from the eastward. We will therefore enter the Water by this passage, and try the deep channel when we leave Southampton. Taking our departure from Cowes Roads, we steer N.E. by E. for two and a quarter miles, until the red and white vertical"], [77, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 59 striped buoy, called Hill Head, is in line with Calshot light vessel, N.N.W. W., the buoy being then about half a mile away. We then steer direct for the buoy and lightship, both of which may be passed on either hand, and thence make for the entrance to Southampton Water. After passing the light ship, we must not go to the eastward of the line joining the lightship and Hill Head buoy, as the water shoals on the eastern side of that line ; nor must we go to the westward of the line joining the \" Spit \" light vessel (moored on the west side of the entrance) and Castle buoy (black and white with staff and cage) which is moored south of Calshot Castle. Between these two lines the water is quite deep. Having passed the curious, round, plum-cake-like tower of Calshot Castle, built at the extremity of a curious spit or peninsula of sand and gravel, we are in the beautiful estuary of Southampton Water, described by that curious old antiquary Leland, in the reign of Henry VIII., in the following quaint words : \u2014 \" The bredth of the mouth or entery of Southampton haven, is by estimation a two myles from shore to shore. At the west point of it, is a stronge castelle, a late builded, caulled Caldshore, commonly Cawshott. There is on the est side agayne it, a place caulled Hamel Hooke (Hamble), where be a three or four fishars houses. A three miles from Hamel Hooke, that lyeth as at the est point of the haven, goith a creke by north est, up yn to the land caulled Com... le Creke, or of sum Haven, (no doubt the river Hamble) wherein is a very fair rode for greate shippes. And to this creke by my estimation, resortith the water cummyng from Bishops Waltham, a praty tounlet, a three myles of. A myle from the mouth of Hamelrise Creke, lyithe Letlege (? Netley) on the shore upward in the main haven. Here a late, was a great abbey or building of White Monkes. About two myles upward, brekith in a great creke (no doubt Itchen) out of the main haven, and one goith into the lande by northe. On the left hand of this creke by west, a little from the shore, standith a chapelle of Our Lady of Grace, sumtime hauntid with pilgrimes. Right agayne it is Hitchyn (Itchen) a smaulle village on the est side, and hereof the trajectus is caulled Hitchyn Fery. The toun of Hampton is not half a myle above the mouth of this creke.\""], [78, "60 THE WATERS OF THE WIGHT. Putting aside the quaint style and orthography, this des cription is accurate enough at the present day ; but perhaps a little more detail is desirable. As we pass Calshot Castle, (built early in the sixteenth century, and now dwindled down to a coastguard station), the New Forest stretches away for miles on our left, while on the eastern bank is seen the entrance to the tributary Hamble, and further on the imposing red brick facade of Netley, the largest of our military hospitals. Both sides of the water are bordered by mud flats, so that a decent berth must be given them ; but this is rendered easy by the line of red buoys along the eastern banks, and a series of black and white ones, and a beacon, on the edge of the western flats, which are much more extensive. After passing Netley, a very hideous and imposing buoy will be seen, apparently in the middle of the water, and marked \" N.W. Netley.\" Large vessels pass to the westward of this, as it is placed at the extremity of a spit running out from the eastern shore. There is, however, two and a quarter fathoms all round it for a quarter of a mile, and a yacht of moderate draft may pass it on either side at that distance. We now pass Hythe pier on our port side, and come in sight of the little light vessel at the mouth of the Itchen. This, and the red buoy to the south of it, we leave to the east ward. The channel now becomes very narrow, and at low water, if beating, the lead should be kept going. With a free wind, however, the course is sufficiently indicated by the lower and middle gymp black and white buoys and a large hulk to port, and the red buoys to starboard. The anchorage extends from the neighbourhood of the \" Trincomalee \" hulk, right away to the northward past Southampton town pier. Liking, as we do, a quiet berth, we will pass the hulk, leaving it on our port hand, and proceed two or three hundred yards past the pier, where we will drop our hook in two fathoms L.W.S. Having stowed sails, let us land, and take a look at Southampton. The town will be found to be a large place, situated on a peninsula between the Itchen and the Test or Anton (the main river, of which Southampton Water is the"], [79, "61 OUR SILVER STREAK. estuary). About a mile south-west of the present town, stood the Roman Clausentum, the site of which is now occupied by Bittern Farm. In Domesday Book, the place is called Hantune, but there is no doubt that it existed long prior to the Conquest ; and indeed it is said that Canute not only resided here, but that it was on the shores of Southampton Water, that he administered the celebrated rebuke to his flattering courtiers. The ancient wall, which is still standing in many places, is said to have been built by Richard II., in consequence of an attack made by the French in 1377. The old town was entered by several gates, three of which are still standing, viz., West Gate, South Gate, and Bar Gate. The last is a handsome and venerable structure, bestriding the principal street (High Street). It is embattled and machicolated, and is sufficiently large to serve as a town hall. On the north point are two cyclopean figures, representing Sir Bevois of Southampton, and the Giant Ascupart. Outside the town, the London road runs through the beautiful South ampton Common, 365 acres in extent, which belongs to the Corporation. It is richly wooded, and well laid out with promenades and drives, and is entered through a fine avenue of elm trees. The water supply of the town is derived from an artesian well sunk on this common. Several interesting excursions may be made from South ampton. By crossing the floating bridge over the Itchen, a walk, or cab drive, of three miles, will bring us to the picturesque ruins of Netley Abbey, which are well worth a visit. On the other side of the water, an expedition may be made from Hythe (whither a steamer plies from Southampton) to the beautiful scenery of the New Forest ; and ten and a half miles from here, on the main road to Lyd, is the \" stoney cross\" which marks the spot where William Rufus was killed. For those who desire to thoroughly investigate the New Forest, Lyndhurst is the best centre. Beaulieu Abbey may also be visited from Hythe, distant four and a half miles ; but most yachtsmen will prefer doing this excursion via the Beaulieu river, in the yacht's gig or dingey. Having exhausted Southampton and its neighbourhood, let us once more direct our bow to the southward, passing between"], [80, "62 THE WATERS OF THE WIGHT. the piers and the hulk, so as to avoid the deceptive gymp mud, which stretches from the western shore pretty well across to within a few yards of the hulk. As the flood is beginning to make as we pass Netley, it is a good opportunity to investigate the pretty little harbour of Hamble, now becoming quite a head-quarters for small yachts, and boasting a club-house, in the shape of a corrugated iron structure, erected by the Minima Yacht Club. To enter the Hamble, we leave the red buoy, which is moored off the entrance, on our port side. From there, the course is N. by E., until the first perch (which is fixed on the west or port side) is reached. The channel then runs N.E. J E., between two other perches on the port side, and one to starboard, as far as the point, after which we keep about mid river, and anchor in two fathoms. Hamble is a great place for lobsters and crabs, and those who like these crustaceans, may obtain them here both cheap and good. The ebb having commenced, we leave the Hamble, and proceeding past Calshot Castle make for the black and white chequered buoy with staff and cage, lying S.E. by S. of the Castle, giving Calshot beach, and the line joining it and the buoy, a berth of a quarter of a mile, as a very shallow bank runs from the castle beach to the buoy, with a convex sweep. From the buoy, we next make for the Spit light vessel, which marks the extreme easterly point or spit of the same bank, and which we accordingly leave to the westward. From here to the North Thorn red buoy, the course is about S.W., and the distance less than half a mile. This buoy may be passed by us on either side, as there is not less than fifteen feet of water within a quarter of a mile on either hand of it ; but large vessels keep to the westward of it. The next buoy is Thorn Knoll (red with staff and cage), which may be treated in the same way, only rather more so, as there is over three fathoms within half a mile on each side of it. Indeed for yachting purposes it may be treated as being placed in mid channel. Proceeding onwards, we leave the red N.W. Bramble buoy, and the red and white horizontally striped West Bramble buoy, to the eastward, as they mark the edge of the shallow Bramble Bank, and give the western shoal a berth of- half a"], [81, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 63 mile (not shoaling to less than two and a half fathoms). As the wind is westward, we must beat down the Solent, the general trend of which is about W.S.W. For this purpose it is necessary to give the north shore a wide berth, as it is very flat all the way to Hurst Castle. From Stansore point (opposite the West Bramble buoy), where the land begins to run westward, the shoal called \" Lepe \" bulges out into the channel, its outer edge being marked by two red and white buoys, inside of which it is unsafe to venture. N. \u00a3 W. of the East Lepe buoy, is the entrance into the beautiful Beaulieu (Bewley) River, which is well worth exploring in a gig or dingey, but not in the yacht. To do this, steer N. \\ W. from the East Lepe buoy, until within a few yards of the coastguard boat-house. Then keep parallel with the shore for one hundred yards until you come nearly but not quite up to the village. Thence the course is due west, towards the inside of Needs Oar point. The river then curves N. W. by N. for three quarters of a mile, the channel being rather nearer to the west bank than to the east. After this, the channel runs fairly mid river as far as Beaulieu Abbey, which is situated about four miles above Needs Oar point. The Beaulieu river is very beautiful, when the mud is covered, the banks being thickly wooded. The Cistercians, who built the abbey, followed their usual custom of chosing a lovely site for their retreat. The village of Beaulieu lies on the west bank, while on the right, across the road, we see the old buttresses of the abbey, backed by the ancient refrectory, now used as a parish church. There still remains among the ruins, three early English arches of great beauty, with shafts of Purbeck marble. We must, however, not miss our ebb tide, sd returning to the yacht, and leaving both the Lepe buoys to the northward, and giving the Gurnard and Salt Mead ledges, on the Isle of Wight coast (both marked by red buoys) a fair berth, we wriggle merrily down the Solent. After passing Salt Mead buoy, the island may be safely approached to within half a mile, all the way to Yarmouth, but the Hampshire coast is fringed with an extensive mud flat,"], [82, "64 THE WATERS OF THE WIGHT commencing near the shore inside West Lepe Buoy, and running thence right away to Hurst Castle, with slight concave front. The coast line, however, forms a still deeper concavity, so that this flat has, in the middle of it, opposite Yarmouth, a width of considerably over a mile. At this point is a beacon, known as \" Jack in the basket,\" marking the entrance to the Lymington river, and so long as we keep this beacon west, or any thing north of west, we shall avoid the mud. With northerly winds, Jack in the basket is a good place to bring up in two fathoms, and from there a visit may be paid, in the dingey, to the sleepy little town of Lymington, distant about a mile and a half. As, however, the wind is westerly, we will drop our anchor for the night off Yarmouth pier, in two to three fathoms. Yarmouth is a dead-alive place, and contains little of interest. The morning being fine, with a light north-west wind, we will attempt a trip round the back of the island to Portsmouth. There are, to the west of Yarmouth, some nasty rocks, known as the Black Rocks (marked with a red buoy). We must therefore make an offing of a mile or so to avoid them, and as the tide runs very strong hereabouts, we will not start until the last hour of the ebb, which will be sufficient to take us past the Needles. After weathering the Black Rocks buoy, one may approach the island shore to within a quarter of a mile, until we reach the narrows between the Wight and Hurst Castle ; but between Hurst Castle and Jack in the basket, the Hampshire coast must be given a wide berth. Indeed the castle should never be brought to bear anything south of W.S. IV. Upon reaching the narrows, the navigation becomes critical, as the channel is bounded by dangerous shoals on either hand, and the tide, at springs, runs at fully five knots. Between these narrows and the celebrated \" Needles,\" which form the extreme western point of the island, are three beautiful bays, named Coldwell Bay, Totland Bay, and Alum Bay, the latter renowned for the variegated red, grey and yellow lines of its sandstone cliffs. But however lovely these bays may be from an artistic standpoint, they are full of dangers to the navigator, Coldwell Bay especially being full of"], [83, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 65 rocks. A red buoy is moored in the centre of it, at the extremity of Warden Ledge, and should be left to the south ward. After passing this, the rest of the dangers on the island shore may be avoided, by keeping the Needles lighthouse west of S. W. by W. The north side of the channel is no less dangerous than the other. Hurst Castle, it is true, may be approached to within a hundred yards ; but thence the dreaded Shingles Bank runs S.W. by W. for over three miles. The south edge of the Shingles is, however, well marked by three red and white buoys, so that with a commanding breeze, it is not difficult to avoid it. The Needles rocks may be approached quite close, but if the wind had been south-westerly instead of north-westerly, we should have found a very lively tumble here ; for under such circumstances, the sea, \" Unequal pressed, with broken tide And blind commotion heaves \"* in a very unpleasant fashion. In short, there is a smart race off the Needles, caused by the strong tide shooting over the submarine ledge, three fathoms deep, known as the Bridge Reef, which is really a continuation of the Needles Point. Having passed the Needles, we are once more in the open channel, and must steer south-east, which will lead us, free of all dangers, to St. Katherine's point. Had it been necessary to beat, we might safely have approached the shore to within half a mile, taking care that St. Katherine's point was never allowed to bear more S. than S.E. \\ S., as this bearing leads clear of the dangerous Brook Chine rocks and Atherfield ledges, on the latter of which the North German Lloyds mail steamer \" Eider \" was recently wrecked. Even if making a direct course this bearing should be noted, as there is said to be a strong indraft into the bay between the Needles and St. Katherine's. The scenery, from the Needles eastwards, is superb. At first it consists of high white chalk cliffs, crowned with green grass, and shadowed with soft and pearly greys. Soon after passing the valley called Freshwater Gate, however, the strata changes, at Brook Chine, from chalk to greensand, and this * Q. Thompson. E"], [84, "66 THE WATERS OF THE WIGHT. again alters, between Barnes Chine and Cowleaze Chine, (about one and a half miles from Atherfield point) to the Wealden formation. Having passed this dangerous point, we enter Chale Bay, with its wild and lofty brown clay cliffs, a crack in which, forms the celebrated Black Gang Chine. We now reach St. Katherine's point, where, in bad weather, there is a very violent race ; and even with gentle winds and smooth seas, there is a strong ripple, which tells the experienced eye what he might expect here when \" All the great \u00c6olian orchestra Storms out its mad sonata in the gale.\"* We are now sailing off the beautiful region of the Undercliff, which stretches, roughly speaking, from Black Gang to Dunnose. The undercliff consists of a natural terrace at the summit of the sea cliffs, but at the foot of equally lofty ones rising behind it. The Rev. James White speaks of it thus : \u2014 \" Consisting of a platform, varying from half a mile to a quarter of a mile in width, bounded on the south by the undulating bays and promontories of the Channel, and on the north by a perpendicular wall of gray rocks, which form the buttress to a range of downs of almost mountainous elevation, it is easy to see that it unites two of the principal constituents of a beautiful landscape. But when, besides its guardian hills and ever varying ocean, we remember the richness of its vegetation, the clearness of its air, and the wild seclusion of its innumerable dells, the glowing expressions of enthusiastic tourists would seem not much, if at all, beyond the truth.\" The undercliff is a curious geological phenomenon, and was undoubtedly formed as follows : \u2014 The strata of the cliffs (counting from the summit) consists of chalky marl, chalk, green sandstone, blue marl (blue slipper), and red sandstone. The soft blue marl, under the deteriorating action of land springs, oozes out, and deprives the upper strata of their support. These consequently fall, and form the beautiful terraces for which the back of the Wight is so famous. Even in comparatively recent times, (1799 and 181 8) great landslips have occurred from this cause. On the end of St. Katherine's point, and beneath the lofty shadow of St. Katherine's Hill, is a lighthouse shewing a * Wendell Holmes."], [85, "67 OUR SILVER STREAK. flashing electric light of the first order, but in foggy weather it cannot be trusted to penetrate very far, nor can the powerful fog syren be heard a few miles to the westward in westerly winds. Rounding St. Katherine's point, 'our stem must be pointed towards Dunnose, E. J S., six miles away. We can with safety skirt the land at a distance of half a mile or less. The scenery of this six miles is, I think, the finest in the island, combining, as it does, grand cliffs, piled one on top of the other, with rank vegetation and varied colouring. Passing various little bays, we come, about half-way, to the new town of St. Lawrence, and another mile brings us opposite Ventnor, the flourishing Metropolis of the undercliff. It is impossible to call Ventnor itself, apart from its situation, picturesque or dignified. It is in truth a mere aggregation of modern seaside houses, together with the inevitable pier. Perhaps the most imposing building is the consumption hospital on the east of the town, facing the sea, but this formal stone building cannot be said to add to the beauty of the coast, or to be at all in keeping with its wild surroundings. Mr. Podsnap seated on the throne of a pirate king could scarcely be a more incongruous object. On the whole then, we leave Ventnor behind us without regret, and, passing sweet little Bonchurch, approach the mighty headland of Dunnose, towering above us to the height of nearly eight hundred feet. It was off Dunnose that one of our most painful naval disasters occurred, viz., the capsizing of H. M.S. \" Eurydice\" about ten years ago. This sailing frigate, containing a crew of young men training for the navy, was returning from a cruise to the West Indies, and, in order to get to Spithead before dark, her captain was running under a heavy press of sail before a fine S.W. breeze. Suddenly, and without any, warning the wind chopped round, in a violent squall, to the N.W. The ship thus taken aback, was thrown on her beam ends, and her ports being open, she went down, before sail could be reduced, or her stern got to the wind. She sank within a couple of miles of the shore, drowning all but some three or four of her crew. Passing Dunnose, we enter Sandown Bay, and, at the same time, say good bye to the most beautiful part of the"], [86, "68 THE WATERS OF THE WIGHT. coast. It is true that, on the other side of the bay, we have the grand white wall of Culver Cliff, surmounted by Bembridge Down and fort ; but it lacks the colour and vegetation of the southern coast, and strikes one as cold and unsatisfactory after the glories of the undercliff. There is nothing to see in Sandown Bay (although in west winds there is good anchorage there, off Sandown close to the beach in three to five fathoms), so we will make a N.E. by E. J E. course for Bembridge Ledge buoy, distant seven and a half miles. Bembridge Ledge is a nasty reef of rocks running cff Bembridge foreland, the extreme eastern point of the island. This reef projects nearly three-quarters of a mile from the shore, and has, in places, no more than one and a quarter fathoms on it. We must, therefore, keep outside the black and white chequered buoy, which marks its extremity. We can, however, safely keep inside the black and black and white buoys, which we pass en route about one and a half miles to the southward of the Ledge buoy, as these only mark the \" Princessa \" shoal, with nineteen feet least water on it. Having fetched the Ledge buoy, we can make a direct course for the Warner light, N., distant two and a half miles, whence we sail into Portsmouth by the same courses as when we entered on our way down from Newhaven. If the wind had been northerly, so as to necessitate a beat, it would have been necessary, after passing Culver Cliff, to give the shore a berth of a mile right up to the Warner. Between Bembridge Ledge and the Warner, lies Brading Haven. At high water this forms an extensive and land locked lake ; but at low water it is, for the most part, an expanse of mud, except a narrow channel just within and to the south of the entrance. It is used a good deal by small local craft, especially those fitted with centre boards, but no yacht of any size can be recommended to enter without a pilot. The passage commences on the north side of the round fort, and the south side of it is indicated by a row of perches ; but it is very narrow, and dries in places."], [87, "69 OUR SILVER STREAK.

The tidal streams in the Solent are peculiar, but they may be summed up as follows : \u2014 (1) The stream flows to the westward throughout the whole length of the strait (i.e., between the Warner and the Needles) for four and a half hours, viz., from about one and a half hours before H.W. at Dover to three hours after H.W. there. (2) For two hours, viz., from three hours after H.W. Dover until five hours after H.W. Dover, the stream still runs westward from Cowes to the Needles, but eastward from Cowes to the Warner. (3) At five hours after H.W. Dover, the stream flows to the eastward throughout the whole length of the Solent for about five and a half hours ; viz., until one and a half hours before H.W. Dover. But although the direction of the stream changes as above indicated, the rise and fall of the water, and consequently the flow and ebb in the harbours of Portsmouth and Southampton, are by no means synchronous with the change of direction. In fact, owing to the Solent and main channel streams reacting on each other, the phenomenon known as double high water occurs at all ports between Portsmouth and Poole, and even to a modified extent at Weymouth. Thus, at Southampton, the flood commences at five hours after H.W. Dover, i.e., contemporaneously with the first of the eastern stream through the Needles. It continues to flow for about six and a half hours, then ebbs feebly for one hour, and then again flows for an hour, making second high water at about two hours after H.W Dover. It then ebbs for three and a half hours."], [89, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 71 At Portsmouth, the harbour flood commences at about six hours before H.W. Dover (i.e., about an hour after the east stream has commenced to run through the Needles), and makes second H.W. at about one hour after H.W. Dover (i.e. about two and a half hours after the stream has turned to the westward at Spithead). after which it ebbs for five hours, during the first two of which it runs down the Solent, and during the remaining three of which it runs to the eastward. In other words, starting from the Needles (or anywhere inside the Solent) for Portsmouth, with the first of the east stream, you will have a five and a half hours tide up to Spithead, and an additional two and a half hours before the tide begins to run out of Portsmouth Harbour. So, also, if you leave Portsmouth Harbour at second high water bound westward, you will carry a two hours tide to Cowes, and thence a two hours tide to the Needles. If, however, the wind be light, so that Cowes cannot be reached in the two hours (i.e., before the tides split off Cowes), it will be better to start at first high water Portsmouth, and not to wait for the second high water. At the back of the island, the inshore streams turn about an hour or one and a half hours, before high and low water at Dover ; but at an offing, of four miles, they are practically synchronous with the Dover times."], [90, "CHAPTER XII. THE NEEDLES TO PORTLAND. Now in progress towards St. Alban's.\" Henry VI., I., 4. HAVING awaited the first of the ebb at Yarmouth, the yachtsman usually makes thence direct for Portland. As, however, we are on a voyage of inspection, we will take matters more leisurely, and call at Poole on our way. Having passed the Needles, and arrived close to the southward of the West Shingles buoy, we steer thence W. by N. for the swatchway buoy at the entrance to Poole. This course is half a point south of the correct magnetic bearing, but there is a strong indraft into Christchurch and Poole bays, both on flood and ebb, which would sweep us considerably north of the buoy, were we to steer direct for it. As we clear the Shingles, Christchurch Head is seen on the starboard hand, followed, at an interval of five or six miles, by the wooded slopes and tasteful villas of Bournemouth. Having found the red swatchway buoy, the channel (which is narrow, and a mile and a half long before you reach the entrance of the harbour), is marked by black buoys to star board, and red and white ones to port, so that, unless it be foggy, there is no difficulty ; and if it be foggy, a stranger would be a lunatic to risk life and property in attempting to find his way in. At night the entrance to Poole is well lighted by two lighthouses. By keeping the high and low lights in line, after passing the swatch buoy, as long as the house lights on Brownsea Island (inside the harbour) can be seen, you will be in the channel ; but directly Brownsea lights begin to be shut in by North Haven point, cease steering for the light houses, and make for Brownsea. Having passed the lighthouses, we can either round North Haven point (the peninsula on which they stand), or bring up in Brownsea road, between the island and the point ; or, having brought a third light which is situate on the inside of North Haven point, E. \\ N.. we can steer W. S. W. \\ S. into South Deep, out of the traffic; or, if so minded, we can proceed to Poole."], [91, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 73 To perform the latter feat, we must direct our course to starboard, leaving a bell buoy, two red and white buoys successively, and several beacons, on our port hand, until we get (at the end of a mile) abreast of Parkstone pier, a long pier projecting into the channel from the adjacent shore. Thus far the channel is very narrow, but has plenty of water in it. From Parkstone pier, the channel widens, and the course is W.N.W. \\ N. for a mile and a half, until opposite Poole, where we can bring up, on the south side of the channel, in ten feet L.W.S. If Poole harbour were always full of water, it would be one of the finest smooth water sailing grounds on our coast. Unfortunately, it is for the most part, and at most times of the tide, little more than a huge and a desolate mud flat, with three deep and narrow channels meandering about it like the arms of some gigantic octopus ; and even at high water springs there is but a foot or so of water over the greater part of the mud. The harbour is therefore not good yachting ground (although it is first-rate for laying up), and most men who do not belong to the neighbourhood, will be content to use Brownsea Road merely as a shelter for the night. Poole itself is a very ancient place, dating back to Roman times, and, in the reign of Edward III., was considered a town of some importance. It is, however, now but a small place, of some ten to twelve thousand inhabitants. Antiquaries will find some interesting relics here, including the town cellars near the quay, and an ancient wall and gate in Clement's Alley, of the time of Richard III. In the neighbourhood, are also to be found sepulchral barrows, and the great Druidical Stone known as Agglestone, weighing upwards of four hundred tons. Leaving the harbour, we cross Studland Bay (where there is capital anchorage in west winds in two fathoms) and pass close to the curious detached shafts of chalk rock known as Old Harry and his wife, off Standfast Point. Here we enter Swanage Bay, where yachts often bring up close to Swanage town, but I think it myself rather a roily place. Off Peveril point (the southern extremity of Swanage Bay) is a very smart race, caused by the tide sweeping over Peveril"], [92, "NEEDLES TO PORTLAND. 74 ledge, with only two fathoms on it. A black and white chequered buoy is moored at the extremity of the ledge, and should be passed on its eastern side. We now enter Durlstone Bay, bounded by lofty lime stone cliffs, which culminate in Durlstone Head, and thence run south westward to Anvil Point, where there is a light house. From Durlstone Bay right away to Weymouth, the coast is fine and bold, with high cliffs, and may be approached to within a mile and a half in over five fathoms. After rounding Anvil point, the massive cliffs of St. Alban's Head (three hundred and sixty feet in height) come in sight. An eight fathom ledge runs out from the head, for about two and a half miles W.S.W., having twenty-six fathoms on one side, and thirteen and upwards on the other. There is consequently a sharp race here, which is said to be, in bad weather, not much inferior to that of Portland. Indeed, the authorities assert that the whole sea between St. Alban's and Portland, is then one broken sheet of water. My own experi ences of St. Alban's, however, have been mild enough, and, with any east in the wind, there is, I think, nothing to fear. Nevertheless, I doubt not, that a strong S.W. breeze would knock up a nasty breaking sea. From St. Alban's Head, the land trends about W.N.W. to Weymouth Bay (distant fifteen miles), and, in the opinion of many people, forms the most magnificent scenery which is to be found east of Devon. For the first six miles we have a succession of noble cliffs, fringed with reefs of clay called the Kimmeridge Ledges extending pretty well three quarters of a mile from the shore. Then comes Worbarrow Bay, affording good shelter in northerly winds, and two miles further on, we arrive at the romantic and well known Lulworth Cove. This cove is a circular pit, of about five hundred yards diameter, formed by some mysterious process of nature in the lofty cliffs which encircle it on all sides, with the exception of the narrow entrance by which the waters of the sea obtain access to it. It is situated sufficiently far from the usual haunts of tourists, to be still absolutely devoid of the customary seaside abominations. Both heads of the entrance are bold,"], [93, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 75 and of magnificent proportions, but the westernmost one is singularly fine, not only in form and height, but in the extra ordinary contortions of its stratification, which rival the famous ones on the north shore of the bay of Uri on the lake of Lucern. The scenery in the neighbourhood is magnificent. The valley of the Golden Bowl is one of the most beautiful in England, and the ruins of Corse Castle (about a two hours drive), are full of interest ; the drive there and back over Whitney Hill, and through Church Knowle, returning by way of Stoborough and Holme Lane, is quite charming. Luhvorth Castle too, and Bindon Abbey, are both well worth a visit. Conveyances may be had at the Cove Hotel. There is very good sea bottom fishing to be had in the neighbourhood of Lulworth, but of course local knowledge is essential. Altogether, Lulworth is a charming little place, and the owner of a small yacht may spend several pleasant days there. It is, however, rather an awkward harbour to get into and out of, as, owing to the height of the surrounding cliffs, one is apt to lose the wind at the entrance, in which case the yacht may drift ashore before a boat can be got ahead. Moreover, the bottom is not free from rocks, so that it is desirable, before entering, to get a local boatman to pilot you in. I believe that the rocks are mainly on the west side of the cove, but there is no large chart published, and it is impossible to be quite sure about this. Three miles beyond Lulworth, we come opposite to White Nore point, the hill behind which, rises to the height of 540 feet ; and further on still, we pass Ringstead, taking care to keep a good mile out, to escape the ledges which here run out from the shore. We are now at the entrance of Weymouth Bay, and can make a course either for Weymouth harbour, or for the harbour of refuge at Portland. Had the wind been anything west of south, Portland would have been quiet enough, and we would have dropped our anchor off the village of Cheselton (or Castleton) in the south-west corner of the bay. As, however, we have come down with a south-east breeze, I know well, from past experience, that lying in Portland means diving bowsprit under all night, a performance not conducive to"], [94, "76 THE NEEDLES TO PORTLAND. comfort, so we will make for the rather confined but smooth little haven of Weymouth. Weymouth harbour is formed (as its name implies) by the mouth of the river Wey. It faces about east (magnetic) and is bounded on the south, by the promontory called the Nothe, and a short breakwater, and on the north, partly by the town of Weymouth, and partly by a substantial stone pier nearly a quarter of a mile long. The passage between the Nothe and this pier is very narrow, (perhaps one hundred yards) so that it is necessary to have a stern rope taken ashore on the south (or Nothe) side, as there is no room to swing, and the north (or pier) side is devoted to the Channel Island and other steam packets. There is about eight to nine feet in the harbour at L.W.S., but only seven at the entrance, off the end of the Nothe pier. Having brought the harbour mouth due west, we now sail in, under head sails only, between two buoys ; but, as there is a four foot reef, called the Mixen, running from the south breakwater head to one hundred yards inside the Nothe, with a convex sweep to it, we must keep well over to the north (or pier) side of the harbour, until the light-beacon is passed, after which we starboard our helm, and let go fairly close to the south shore. In doing this, however, great care is required, as the place is strewed with moorings, and it is consequently an easy matter to lose one's anchor. It is, therefore, a wise plan to procure the assistance of a local waterman. Strictly speaking, the town of Weymouth is confined to the rather mean streets which lie on the south side of the harbour. The town on the north of the harbour, and facing the bay, is in reality Melcombe Regis; but, colloquially, one always speaks of Melcombe Regis as Weymouth, and I shall so call it here. There can be no doubt that Weymouth is a very fine watering place. The town forms a semicircle of a mile or so round the shores of the bay, while, between the houses and the sea, is a broad esplanade, well kept, and furnished with numerous seats and a fine statue of Geo. III., a monarch who was very partial to the place. There are very good shops in Weymouth, and several good hotels, the principal one, called the Burdon, being really first rate. Weymouth is also the"], [95, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 77 head-quarters of the Royal Dorset Yacht Club, which has its house here. A small bird called the wheatear, somewhat resembling a lark, is to be obtained in abundance at Wey mouth during harvest time, and is extremely succulent. There are a great many places of interest in the neighbour hood of Weymouth, and many pretty walks, particularly on the north road towards Dorchester, which passes through Nottington, with its waterfalls, glen, and mineral springs, Radipole and bosky Upwey, where the river Wey has it source, and fertile Bincombe, famous for its fruit and flowers. Drives may also be had to Osmington, the ruins of Abbots bury, Burdon Abbey, Maiden Castle, and other places of interest. On the south of Weymouth, lies the so-called Isle of Portland ; but it is, in reality, a rocky peninsula, united to the mainland by a narrow isthmus called Chesil Beach. On the way there, we pass Sandsfoot Castle (temp Hy. VIII.), and crossing the Fleet Water (a shallow stream which runs for many miles northward parallel to the Chesil Beach) we find ourselves in the island, and another mile brings us to Castleton. Here a carriage may be obtained, which will convey us all over Portland, passing the great convict prison, and the extensive stone quarries, where the unfortunates condemned to penal servitude are seen working, and sometimes, when the warder's back is turned, loafing. Arriving at the southern end of the peninsula, we visit the lighthouses, whence a fine view of the Channel, and the dreaded race, may be obtained. Portland is very strongly fortified, as the harbour, which is now one of the finest in Great Britain, would be made the base of naval operations in case of war. The breakwater has been constructed almost exclusively by convict labour, and is nearly a mile and a half long, with an opening on the south side. The Chesil Beach, which unites Portland to the mainland, is a very curious geological formation. It consists of a narrow bank of pebbles, nearly sixty feet high, extending from Port land to Bridport, a distance of about eight miles. At Portland, the pebbles are large, averaging three or four inches in diameter ; but as we proceed towards Bridport, they gradually"], [96, "78 THE NEEDLES TO PORTLAND. decrease in size, so that, off that town, they are little more than coarse sand. The cause of this seems to be a mystery. It is said that the surf on the Chesil Beach, in a south westerly gale, is the highest in the Channel. Even in moderate winds it is pretty bad, and a ship which goes ashore there, has but a very slight chance. Miss Agnes Giberne, in her charming work \" The Ocean of Air,\" thus speaks of it : \u2014 \" As good a view as any of ocean billows, seen from the safe vantage of firm ground, may be obtained on the Chesil Beach, a long reach of shingle, ex tending between Portland and the mainland, some ten miles in length, and rising to a piled-up-shingle height of about sixty feet. If a strong wind blows from the Atlantic straight upon the ridge, a curious contrast can be seen by anyone standing on the summit. Within, the bay between Weymouth and Portland lies calm and blue, still as a lake, broken only by ripples. Without, beyond Chesil Beach, a boiling sea of great waves heaves wildly, and one monster billow after another, twenty feet or more in height, reaching far along the line of shingle, rolls fiercely up, curls grandly over, and falls with a deafening crash, sending forth a rush of foam and spray, grinding the pebbles together and tossing them about like sand. No human being could live beneath the crushing weight of one of these waves. The noise is so deafening, in even a moderate gale, that I have tried in vain to hear words shouted in vigorous masculine tones close at my side. In a storm, so mighty is the turmoil, that a brig has been actually lifted by the sea, carried over the top of the ridge, and landed on the slope beyond, whence a way was made for it later into the quiet bay ! \" The Fleet Water, as I said before, separates the Chesil Beach from the mainland, and flows as far as Abbotsbury, where are the ruins of the Benedictine abbey, dating from the Conquest, and of St. Catherine's chapel Here, too, is Lord Ilchester's celebrated swannery, containing several hundreds of swans, and a wildfowl decoy. These have been in existence for (it is believed) many centuries, and were objects of interest 140 years ago, when Bishop Pococke visited them,* and the swannery even then contained 500 birds. * Dr. Pocock's Travels. Camden Society '< publications, Vol. I., p. 94."], [97, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 79 It will be seen, therefore, that Weymouth is surrounded with objects of interest, and that the yachtsman will have but small ground of complaint if (as very often happens) strong westerly winds, and the turbulent seas off the Bill, keep him chained up there for a week or ten days.

PORTLAND TO DARTMOUTH. \" A shipman was there, wonned far by west : For ought I wot, he was of Dartemouth.\" Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. PORTLAND Bill is decidedly the worst point on the south coast of England, owing to the violent race, and to the fact that in south-west winds (which are the pre- vailing breezes), there is usually a nasty lump of a head sea, until the shelter of the east Devonshire coast is gained. Moreover, there is no harbour, fit for a yacht, nearer than Torquay, or at least Exmouth, as no man with any respect for his vessel, would take her into either of the practically dry harbours of Lyme Regis or Bridport, with any south in the wind. It is therefore not infrequently the case, that yachts are detained at Portland for weeks at a time, waiting for a fair slant across Lyme Bay to Dartmouth or Torquay. Having at length secured a fair breeze, let us make a start. The first problem which we have to solve, is so to time our start as to arrive at the Bill just before the west going stream begins to make, in order to minimize the danger of being drawn into the dreaded race. Now, the tides about Portland are peculiar, (i) The western stream begins at the Bill at three and a quarter hours after high water at Wey mouth, and this is the time at which we must endeavour to reach the Bill. (2) But in getting there we must remember that at this time a stream of great strength is setting to the south-westward all along the east side of Portland, making quite a race off Godner point ; and (3) that there is con currently a similar outset along the west side of Portland, which has, however, somewhat abated in strength when the main western stream is about to begin. The consequence is, that if we arrive at the point too early (i.e., before the eastern stream has finished), the outset from Portland Roads will inevitably carry us past the Bill and right through the race ; and if we arrive too late (i.e., when the western stream has gathered force, and the race is raging to the west of Portland F"], [102, "82 PORTLAND TO DARTMOUTH. Ledge), the stream out of West Bay, may possibly do the same for us. It is therefore highly important, that we should arrive at the Bill just about slack water, or just as the stream is beginning to move to the westward ; and in scheming this, bear in mind that the three-knot outset on the east of Portland will soon rattle you over the five miles between Weymouth and the Bill, even if you have to beat. The cause of Portland race is twofold. In the first place, a ledge of submarine rocks runs out from the Bill for a distance of over a mile, the east and west sides of which are very precipitous, the soundings suddens* rising from six fathoms to twelve. In the next place the peninsulas of Portland and Cherbourg greatly constrict the channel, and cause the main streams of tide to attain a great velocity here (five to seven knots at springs). Lastly, the two outsets from tlie east and west of Portland, (which run with great fury) cross the main streams of flood and ebb, and cause whirls and eddies which cannot fail to break the seas. Picture to yourself then, that a vast body of water eighty feet thick, and moving at the rate of five or six miles an hour, is suddenly confronted with a wall thirty-six feet high, and at the same time crossed with streams running nearly at right angles with a speed of three miles per hour and more, and you will cease to marvel at the terrific commotion which, at spring tides, or in bad weather, constitutes Portland Race. At such times, in the words of Shakespeare : The chiding billow seems to pelt the cloud ; The wind shak'd surge, with high and monstrous main, Seems to cast water on the burning bear, And quench the guards of the ever fix_d pole ; I never did like molestation view Of the enchased flood.\"* There can be no doubt that, under such circumstances, the race is highly dangerous for small vessels ; and I have been told by an eminent naval officer, that he once took one of Her Majesty's cruisers through the race in moderate weather, and his stern boat was lifted by a sea right out of the davits, and carried away. The noise of the race may be heard for a considerable distance, and its appearance has sometimes so alarmed strangers, as to induce them to run ashore on Chesil * Othello II. i."], [103, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 83 Beach, thereby committing the error of jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. I have myself been through the race at neaps, in moderate weather, in a thirty ton yawl, and it was quite sufficiently lively to effectually banish all desire to repeat the experiment. With the east stream, the race is found to the eastward of Portland ledge, and with the west stream on the west of the ledge. With north winds it is generally a couple of miles off the Bill, and even beyond that it is very choppy ; but with south winds, it is not more than half a mile from the point. In all cases there is a narrow strip of smooth water between the Bill and the race, of about three hundred yards in width, and this is the channel through which yachts generally strive to pass. The race is not the only danger off Portland. On the east side of the Bill, at a distance of about two miles, is a shoal known by the significant name of the Shambles, with patches of eleven and twelve feet on it. In bad weather, or during the east stream, if a vessel got entangled in the race, and did not broach to and go down straight away, she would almost inevitably be carried on to the Shambles and knocked into matchwood, as the tide sets right over them. Had we been approaching the Bill from the westward, I should not have attempted the inshore passage, if the west-going stream had been running. The best time to take it from the westward, is three hours before high water at Weymouth. At that time, the main eastern stream is just beginning to make, and the stream out of the East Bay has just ceased. The stream out of the West Bay is, however, in full vigour, so that it is necessary to steer well toward the north of the Bill, otherwise this stream would certainly drift us out into the race. The passage from the westward should never be attempted by a sailing vessel, except between three hours and three-quarters of an hour before high water at Weymouth. At all other times the strong eddy stream is running out of the East Bay, and will almost certainly take you a trip through the race and over the Shambles. Having successfully negotiated the Bill, the question arises, what port we shall make next. Bridport and Lyme Regis are so unsuited to yachts, that we may dismiss them at"], [104, "84 PORTLAND TO DARTMOUTH. once. Most yachtsmen make a direct course to Torquay (W. by N. \\ N., 42 miles distant), or Dartmouth (W. \\ N\u201e 44 miles). There can be no doubt that this is far and away the best course to take, for Lyme Bay is not a pleasant place to be embayed in if a S.W. gale should spring up, Lyme being then the only place to run for, and that is only available at or near high water. Still, as I have promised to shew you the coast, and, as the glass is high and steady, I will, for once in a way, make a course for Exmouth, N.W. by W. \\ W., distant 36 miles. For the first twenty miles, our course leads us away from the shore, which is moreover, with the exception of Portland Island, flat and uninteresting. After that, however, our course and the shores of the bay rapidly converge. Off Lyme, the shores (here distant about nine miles) become high and bold, Golden Cape, about four miles east, and Beer Head, about six miles west of Lyme, being especially magnificent and precipitous chalk headlands, some five or six hundred feet high, and presenting an appearance quite equal to Beachy Head or Shakespeare's Cliff. Just to the eastward of Beer Head, in a little bay, is Season, a town which is rapidly coming into repute as a watering place ; while five miles to the westward of the head, the charming village of Sidmouth nestles between the lofty Peak and Salcombe hills. We are now rapidly approaching Straight point, a red sandstone cliff at the north east of the entrance into the river Exe. This river is one of the few west country rivers which are difficult of access. Indeed it is so awkward, that I shall hoist a pilot signal, and heave-to off the fairway buoy, until I can get some one \" locally acquainted \" to take me in. At low water springs, there is not five feet in the channel in places, and it is very narrow and winding, and encumbered on every side with extensive sands, on which, in bad weather, the sea breaks furiously. The fairway buoy is a large spherical one, with staff and cross, and the channel from there, is marked by seven black buoys on the north side (which is rocky), and four black and white striped ones on the south side. Exmouth is a small, and not very interesting town, but the neighbouring scenery is extremely lovely. The town itself"], [105, "85 OUR SILVER STREAK. consists practically of a large open square, with a public garden in the centre, and a good esplanade along the sea front, about three quarters of a mile in length. The opposite side of the entrance, is bounded by the promontory called \" The Warren,\" an extensive sandbank some mile and a quarter long, which juts out from the western shore, and forms a very effectual breakwater. At high water, the estuary is a mile and a quarter wide, although the mouth is constricted by the Warren to half a mile or less, and the channel is probably not more than 150 yards in width. On the shore opposite Exmouth, is seen Starcross with its pile harbour (only fit, however, for small boats, or such as can take the ground) , and, behind it, the towers and woods of Powderham Castle, the seat of the Earl of Devon, while lower down the estuary, the red cliff called Langstone point, shews where the Warren joins the true coast. There are very good pollock and whiting to be caught about two miles east of Exmouth, and fair bass fishing may be had on the bar. The estuary is very shallow indeed, little more than a mass of sandbanks threaded by intricate shallow and narrow channels, except that one in which large coasters lie off the Warren, where there is two to three fathoms. Leaving Exmouth about half ebb, we shall just catch the first of the south-west stream, although, for the first six or seven miles, it is scarcely perceptible. Our course for Hope's Nose (at the entrance of Torbay) is S.W. \\ S., distant nine miles. There is an islet off the Nose, called the Orestone, by which it may be recognised at a considerable distance. As we emerge from the Exe, we see, broad on our starboard bow, the lovely little town of Dawlish, imbedded in a rift in the precipitous red sandstone cliffs which are typical of this coast. Off a headland to the south of Dawlish, are two curious perpendicular rocks, called the Parson and the Clerk ; and between them and Dawlish, are several other needles or pyramids of a similar character. The deep red cliffs, hollowed into numerous caves, fronted by these isolated shafts, and capped with green turf and trees, with the pretty villas and gardens of Dawlish in the valley, seen with a foreground of sparkling blue sea on a fine day, is a picture which for warmth"], [106, "86 PORTLAND TO DARTMOUTH. of colour, and beauty of the softer sort, is scarcely to be equalled in any part of England. If the wind had not been free, we might have tacked close in to Dawlish, as there is only one danger, viz., the Dawlish rock, with ten feet on it at L.W.S. This rock lies a little to the north of the railway station, and should be avoided by yachts of deep draught. Passing Dawlish, we soon open up the houses of Teign- mouth, a town and seaport lying about three miles further down the coast. Teignmouth is situated at the mouth of the river Teign, and is perhaps the most dangerous harbour to enter in the whole of the south coast of England. The reason of this is that it is possessed of a shifting bar, the position of which changes with every gale, and almost with every tide. It is unapproachable in a heavy sea, and no stranger should, under any circumstances, attempt it without a pilot. That being so, I shall studiously abstain from giving any directions, which might only lead you hereafter into disaster. We will, therefore, leave Teignmouth, and its beautiful headland called the Ness, behind us, taking care not to approach so near to its fatal bar, as to shut in Berry Head behind Hope's Nose. We now rapidly approach Babbacombe Bay, famous for its beauty and its lobsters, which latter may be obtained some times hot, but oftener cold, at the Carey Arms, a delightful little inn at the foot of the valley or combe, which gives the place half its name. In westerly winds, however strong, there is always quiet anchorage in this charming bay, in three to four fathoms sand, and it is surprising that it is not more resorted to by yachts, as it is infinitely pleasanter, in every way, than Torquay Harbour. The view from the Down above the village, is one of the finest in Devon, the whole sweep of Lyme Bay, right away to Portland Bill, being visible in clear weather, The cliffs are still rich red sandstone, hollowed into caves, and shattered into needles and columns, while the coast line itself is broken up into romantic coves, of which that called Ansteys is the most justly celebrated. We now draw up to Hope's Nose, and steering midway between the Flat Rock (a low rock close off the point) and the Orestone (an islet of considerable height), the glorious scenerv of Torbay breaks upon our view."], [107, "87 OUR SILVER STREAK. Torbay is an almost square recess in the coast, about three miles deep and four wide. It faces true east, and is bounded on the north by Hope's Nose, and on the south by the majestic promontory of Berry Head, now, alas, sadly disfigured by the attacks of the quarrymen. Although the red sandstone is in full force at Babbacombe, it is almost entirely supplanted, within a few miles, by the mountain limestone formation, of which the whole of Torbay (with the exception of a patch in the middle) consists. Consequently the scenery is of an entirely different character on the south side of Hope's Nose, to that which is seen on the north side ; rich reds give way to delicate greys and pinks, while the cliffs become bolder and harder. In the N.W. corner of the bay lies Torquay, by some called the Queen of watering places. In the middle of the bay is the rising town of Paignton, much patronised by children, as it possesses excellent sands ; while in the south side of the bay, lies Brixham, the great fishing port of the west, whence sail some of the most magnificent sea boats in the world. As it would not do for you to be so near Torquay without investigating it, we will make for the harbour, although I think myself that it is one of the most disagreeable yacht anchorages on the coast \u2014 lollopy in southerly and easterly winds, and stuffy and close in westerly ones. We, therefore, direct our little ship outside the conical Thatcher Islet, and thence steer so assist to keep the Orestone open south of the Thatcher, which will lead us clear of the several sunken rocks which fringe the north shore of the bay, until the east stone pier of Torquay harbour is well open, when we can sail straight for it. Torquay has two harbours, an outer and an inner one. Being a small craft, the authorities will endeavour to persuade us to enter the inner harbour, so as to leave the outer one for more lordly vessels. This, however, we will politely, but firmly, decline to do, as the inner harbour at low water dries completely out, and is a mere unsavoury mud swamp. The outer harbour has from eight to eighteen feet in it at L.W.S., and, as eight feet will do for us, we will bring up, with the gracious leave of the harbour master, well inside, where we shall be out of the way of big craft entering."], [108, "88 PORTLAND TO DARTMOUTH. Although I confess to some dislike to Torquay, I must, in candour, admit that, viewed from the bay, it is one of the most beautiful towns in Europe. Built on the slopes of several precipitous hills of mountain limestone, scarped and terraced, and intersected by coombes and valleys in all directions, and covered with the most luxuriant verdure (save where the cliffs are too precipitous to support it), nature has provided a site of almost unrivalled beauty. For once, too, the architect and builder have refrained from turning this Garden of Eden into a cheap and vulgar elysium for seaside trippers. The usual hideous rows of lodging houses are conspicuously absent. True, in the old and lower part of the town, round about the harbour, the houses are in rows of the usual depressing description ; but this only forms a small part of modern Torquay, which is almost wholly composed of fine detached dwellings of varied architecture, standing in their own grounds, and peeping out among the well-grown shrubs and trees that surround them. Consequently, instead of spoiling, they rather aid the natural beauties of the place, and make it look what it is, not only a splendidly situated town, but one in which there is nothing tawdry or mean or make-believe about the buildings. Nevertheless, it has its drawbacks. No doubt its water, and its system of sewerage, (the outfall has, at immense expense, been removed to Hope's Nose) are perfect, its streets well kept, and its buildings artistic and good ; but there is no deny ing the fact that its climate is stuffy and relaxing in the extreme, with any but east winds, and, with those winds, it is, in my experience, bitterly cold. I know that residents will tell you that, by going to the top of one of the hills, you may get a climate as bracing as you may desire ; but it is not everyone who cares to live at the top of a precipice, with the necessity of getting all that he requires from the bottom, and it is obviously impossible to take the yacht there. Moreover, everything is dear at Torquay. It is essentially a place for \" the inordinately rich,\" and the owners of small craft are by no means welcomed. Altogether, therefore, I generally conclude to admire Torquay from the bay, and to do my shopping and walking at Paignton, where there is an"], [109, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 89 excellent store (\" Dellar's Stores \"), and the tradespeople are not so very lordly as they are at the more plutocratic Torquay. Torquay has no history. It is entirely parvenu. In the beginning of the century, it merely consisted of a few fisher men's huts, and when Dr. Pococke wrote his tour in the middle of the last century, although he describes Torbay, he makes no mention whatever of any such place as Torquay. That quaint old topographer, indulges in the following funny geological speculations concerning Torbay : \u2014 \" Through this parish (Tor) we rid (sic) between the marble hills, to a part of the bay which we cross'd. These hills are the first beginn ing of the marble county ; but I observed, that in the bottom of the bay,* it was a free stone and sand, and on the other side likewise at Brixham, the hills are marble, so that these hills being entirely of a different nature from what may be supposed to be the natural soil of the country, it is possible they may be an adjectitious body brought over by the flood, and more especially as it is in these elevated parts that petrified shells are frequently found.\" Starting from Torquay, let us sail round the shores of the lovely bay, past Paignton, with its little dry harbour and curious Indian mansion and red sandstone cliff ; past the fine sands of Goodrington, and the charming little Elbury Cove at the S.W. corner of the bay (a most secluded anchorage), with its spring of fresh water bubbling up to the surface of the sea ; and past Brixham with its fleet of splendid trawlers, to Berry Head. The wind being S.W., so long as we were in the bay we were in water scarcely rougher than the proverbial duck pond ; but directly we round the head, and get into the tideway, (especially just off the head), we find it lumpy. On rounding the head (which we may do quite close), we see before us the two tall islets called the Cod Rocks, and, at a considerable distance ahead, the island known as the Eastern Blackstone. The shore between Berry Head and Dartmouth entrance (five miles) is very bold and rugged, commencing with lime stone cliffs, and changing suddenly to more jagged slate off Sharkham Point, about one mile from Berry Head. * !.f.,off Paignton"], [110, "90 PORTLAND TO DARTMOUTH. There are several dangers between Berry Head and Dart mouth Mewstone, viz., the Mag rock off Sharkham Point (which, however, shews at all tides) ; the Druids Mare, which dries about seven feet, close to the shore off Man Sands, the Nimble Rock, with three and a half feet on it at L.W.S., a little east of Downend Point, and Bootfield, with nine feet on it, about due south of Downend Point. Of these, the Nimble is the only really dangerous one, as it lies right in the fairway ; but an excellent mark for this is Start lighthouse just seen over the eastern Blackstone. This line crosses right over the Nimble, and therefore, when off Downend point, keep the Start either inside or outside the Blackstone, and you will miss the Nimble. The Blackstone may be passed on either side, in not less than eight fathoms, as it is steep-to ; but for a yacht of heavy draught, it is safer, between half ebb and half flood, to keep outside, so as to make sure of missing the nine-foot Bootfield, which lies between it and the Nimble. Generally, by keeping half a mile off the shore, or keeping Start Point open of the Blackstone, or Hope's Nose open of Berry Head, all dangers will be cleared. On passing the Blackstone, we steer direct for* the eastern side of the Mewstone, a pyramidal islet of slate, some half mile further on. This is steep-to, and may be passed within a few yards distance. The entrance of the Dart now, for the first time, comes in sight, between two steep and lofty hills, flanked on one side by Dartmouth Castle and battery, and on the other by the old castle of Kingswear, while between the two the river meets the sea. Kingswear point, on the north bank, projects so far south, that its extremity is hidden behind Dartmouth Castle, and consequently, from the sea, the town of Dartmouth seems to lie at the extremity of a fiord or bight, rather than on the bank of a river. After rounding the Mewstone, it is necessary to steer due west for half a mile, so as to miss a rock called West rock, which is just awash at L.W.S. However, when the black buoy, in the apparent middle of the entrance, bears N.W. by W. \\ W. (or inside the western Blackstone), you are past this, and may make direct for the buoy. This buoy (labelled Castle Ledge), is moored at the extremity of a four-foot patch, running out from the north shore, and should strictly be passed on the"], [111, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 91 south side ; but there is nine or ten feet for a hundred yards or so inside it. Between it and the West rock (but well inside the line joining them), is a nasty patch called Bear's Tail, which is just awash at L.W.S., and on which, in bad weather, the sea generally breaks. A very good mark for keeping clear of all these dangers, is to keep the western Blackstone (which is a low islet lying off the S.W. shore of the entrance), just open to seaward of the Castle Ledge buoy, N.W. by W. \\ W., until the buoy is passed, after which both shores may be approached to within one hundred yards or so, until we reach the narrows, when we must not venture inside the Checkstone (black and white chequered buoy) on the S.W. side. After this there is a rock awash quite close to Dartmouth Castle, and a very dangerous one called Kettle rock, twenty yards from Kettle point, right opposite ; but both these, and all other dangers, may be avoided, by giving the shore a berth of thirty yards or less. After passing the narrows, between the two castles, the river widens considerably, and becomes extraordinarily beautiful. On the right are the woods and gardens of Brook Hill House, climbing a steep and lofty hill, while, on the left, a hill, no less lofty, is clothed with trees from the water's edge to the summit, nestling in which is seen the pretty house called Gunfield. Each shore is fairly steep-to here, but the north shore should not be approached so near, as to shut in Dartmouth Custom House behind Kingswear point, as there is a shoal in the bay near to Kingswear lighthouse. Passing Gunfield, we open Warfleet Cove, which nearly dries at L.W.S., and here the river again widens. After passing Warfleet, both shores may be approached, in two fathoms, to within a very few yards, until past Kingswear station. After that, the deep channel is on the west side ; but the usual yacht anchorage is on the east side, on a bank of mud, with one and a half to two fathoms on it at L.W.S. Had we been entering Dartmouth at night, the lighthouse in Kingswear Bay would have proved an infallible guide ; for so long as it appeared white, we should be in the fairway whereas if it became red, we should be too far over towards Kingswear ; and if green, too far over towards the western or Dartmouth shore."], [112, "92 PORTLAND TO DARTMOUTH. Dartmouth is a most lovely harbour ; indeed I doubt whether there is so fair a haven in all England, or Scotland either, as this little western nook. The river is really the bottom of a deep ravine, winding about between lofty and exceedingly steep hills. When one has passed the town quay, a curve in the river, coupled with the promontory of Kingswear Hill, shuts out all view of the sea, so that the harbour has all the appearance of a lake, and is completely land-locked. The author of the \" Beauties of England and Wales,\" writing in 1803, says: \u2014 \"The houses appear situated on the declivity of a scraggy hill, and extending embosomed in trees almost a mile along the water's edge. The dockyards and quay project into the river, and cause an apparent curvature in its course, which has a very beautiful effect, while the uniformity is further broken by the ships of war and smaller vessels gliding along its current. The rocks on each side are composed of a glossy purple coloured slate, and their summits are fringed with various plants and shrubs. From the situa tion of the ground, some of the streets are so much higher than others, that it is almost possible to shake hands from without with a person at the window of an attic.\" This last statement is literally true. I know of several houses in Dartmouth, where, to use an Hibernian form of speech, the front door is in the second floor back, and one at least in which the back door is in the roof. The breaking up of the uniformity, so justly and artistically appreciated by the author above quoted, has of late years vanished, owing to the itch for modern improvements. An embankmentv running the whole length of the town, has now taken the place of the old water fronts, and steps of the houses, possibly to the greater comfort and health of the inhabitants, but most assuredly to the detriment of the place from an \u00e6sthetic standpoint. Several hideous structures have also been raised fronting the river since I first knew Dart mouth, and, taking it all in all, the old borough cannot be said to have improved in beauty of late years. Another recently instituted drawback to Dartmouth, from a yachting standpoint, is its increased and increasing use as a coaling station. The usual yacht anchorage,. on the east side"], [113, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 93 of the river, is close to a line of coal hulks, and the noise which is caused, night and day, by the coaling of two or three large steamers, together with the volume of coal dust which finds its way on board adjacent vessels, not to mention the extensive use of the \" vulgar tongue,\" is highly objectionable to anyone sailing for pleasure. Here again, possibly all this coaling may be good for Dartmouth (although I am told it shortens the lives of the coal tippers, and certainly induces an excessive thirst which is not usually slaked with water); but it vulgarises the place, and takes away nearly all its charms as one of the few spots of romantic beauty left to us in busy England. Still we must not repine ; each tipper gets his penny on every ton shipped, the public-houses get customers, and the butcher and baker sell more meat and bread, and what would you more ? That poor creature, the mere lover of beauty, is but one of the classes. Let him go to Hanover, or perchance to Salcombe, which is nearer, and whither we will presently betake ourselves. In the meanwhile however, we, who have eaten of the tree of local knowledge, will shift our berth for the night, and drop our hook, just above the Britannia and Hindustan, in Mill Creek, where, but for the presence of the great ships, we might fancy ourselves far from towns, and embankments, and coal hulks, in a bay where trees come down to the waters edge, and the full moon seen over Kingswear Hill, turns the harbour into fairyland. Dartmouth (unlike Torquay) boasts of ancient lineage. Her charter of incorporation dates from the reign of Edward III., and she was first represented in Parliament so long ago as the time of the first Edward. Twice has she been sacked and burned by the French, but in 1404, on the occasion of a third visitation, they were \" intercepted by the peasants and women, and the whole party were taken or slain.\" Let us hope that if our neighbours ever essay to invade the place again, they will once more be intercepted by the fair matrons and maids of Dartmouth, and I will undertake that, if not slain, they will at all events be made captives. Dartmouth Castle (at the entrance) is said to date from the time of Henry VII., who agreed \"to pay to the Corporation"], [114, "PORTLAND TO DARTMOUTH. 94 per annum for their building a strong and mighty tower and bulwark with lime and stone, for furnishing the same with guns artillery and ordnance, and for finding a chain in length and strength sufficient,\" Whatever it may have been in the time of the Tudors, however, the most partial historian of Dartmouth cannot now call the castle a strong and mighty tower and bulwark of lime and stone. On the contrary it is, for the most part, a very flimsey building of slate. Probably the greater portion of the old stronghold has been removed, and the modern slate arrangement substituted, but there is still a fine and imposing look-out tower in the castle grounds. The holes in the rocks where the staple was secured, to which the chain \" in length and strength sufficient \" was fastened, and stretched across the mouth of the river, are still readily discernible. A modern battery now protects the sea in advance of the castle, and as it has recently been fitted with ordnance up to date, would probably save the maids and matrons the trouble of subduing any enemy who might attempt to take the place by surprise. Close to the castle at the entrance, is the ancient church of St. Petrox, now fast falling into decay. It is surrounded by a pretty churchyard, where any lover of the sea might be well content to let his bones rest when the inevitable discharge arrives. The present principal church of Dartmouth (although not the mother church) is St. Saviour's, in the middle of the town. It is a fine building, erected in 1372, and contains a beautiful oak chancel screen. The pulpit, like so many others in Devon, is of carved stone, and very ornate and curious. The chancel was built by a local worthy named Hawley, whose \" brass \" is in the church, and after whom, one may conjecture, the local tug was named. There are also some quaint epitaphs in the churchyard. One of the lions of Dartmouth, is the street called the Butterwalk, leading off the quay. The houses on one side are very ancient, and the upper floors project right across the pavement, being supported by columns. They afford one of the principal examples of ancient domestic architecture in the west, but they really only date back to 1640. One of the houses is open for inspection, and contains fine specimens c*f"], [115, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 95 ceiling work and oak carving. A fine walk may be had from Dartmouth to Stoke Fleming, overlooking Start Bay. The views of the harbour and bay are magnificent. The Church at Stoke contains some very ancient brasses and effigies, dating back to 1310. A steamer runs up and down the Dart, twice every day, but the pleasanter way is to row up as far as Sharpham, after which the river is tame and uninteresting. As, however, it is encumbered with shoals above Dittisham, you had better either provide yourself with a local boatman, or purchase, at Cranford's shop, a chart of the river. Personally, I think the finest part of the Dart is the entrance. Still, the upper reaches are singularly beautiful ; for the river winds about in great folds, amidst verdant and precipitous hills, the trees here and there opening and disclos ing a smooth glade of brilliant green, with perhaps a fine mansion peeping out from '-immemorial elms,\" while herons stud the banks and add to the romantic nature of the scenery. The sinuosity of the stream gives it the appearance of a lake, or series of lakes, and the deception is heightened, here and there, by beautiful creeks and inlets, among which, at times. it is no easy task for the stranger to pick out the true course of the river. As far as Dittisham, the Dart is readily navigable by a yacht, taking care, after passing the Britannia, to give the west shore a good berth. After Dittisham, however (where the river widens out into a large basin over a mile square), it becomes shoal, and the channel narrow and winding. The tides run very hot in the Dart, at springs, so that between the castles, it is difficult, even with a fair wind, to stem the stream. At neaps, however, it is easy to turn to wind ward against it. One great advantage of the Dart as a yachting station, is that there is no bar, so that it can be entered at any time. There are some good shops at Dartmouth, notably Cranford's for books, stationery, and china ; Fox and Co.'s for yachts flags, yachting caps, and clothes of all sorts (one of the best shops of its kind in the west of England) ; Bartlett's for groceries, and Tolman's for yachts ironmongery, &c. ; and"], [116, "96 PORTLAND TO DARTMOUTH. Hodge, of Sandquay, does yachts repairs quickly and well, and at a fair and reasonable price. The great event of the year at Dartmouth is the three days' regatta, which always takes place on the last Thursday, Friday, and Saturday in August. It is really a brilliant and pretty scene, although a noisy one, but there is no rowdyism. If, however, it happens to be spring tides, and the glass should fall, look out ; for under such circumstances the lines of yachts, moored to each other stem and stern, sometimes drag, and then there is a pretty kettle of fish, bulwarks gone, bowsprits smashed, and the air thick with the language of excited skippers. Outside Dartmouth there is a good whiting ground, at a distance of some six miles from the shore. Bass may also be taken with a fly in the neighbourhood of the Mewstone and Blackstones, while, at times, mackerel can be caught in the bay or even in the harbour with a spinner. Soles and dabs may be caught in the river, either with a small trawl (which may be hired) or, as to the dabs, with a hook and mussel ; while delicious whiting pout are caught in various parts of the harbour, and notably off the castle.

The main eastern stream begins at the following times : \u2014 At Portland Bill, at 3 hours before H.W. at Weymouth, or about 5 hours after H.W. Dover. About half-way between the Bill and the Start, at 2 hours before H.W. at Weymouth. or contemporaneously with L.W. at Dover. Between Hope's Nose and Start, at 2^ hours before H.W. at Dartmouth, or 4^ hours after H.W. at Dover. There is a local outset of over 9 hours' duration from Weymouth Bay along the east coast of Portland, commencing shortly before H.W. at Weymouth, and lasting until 3 hours before the next H.W. there. A similar outset runs along the west coast of Portland, out of West Bay, commencing at low water at Weymouth, and lasting until 3 hours before the next low water. Consequently, one or both of these streams are always running, viz , the East Bay outset, except during the first three hours of the main channel flood ; and the West Bay outset, except during the last three hours of the main channel ebb. It is H.W. at Weymouth F. & C. at 7 ; at Lyme Regis at 620 ; at Torquay and at Dartmouth at 6. Practically, in all places, about 5 hours before Dover.

The practical result is, that if you start from the Bill with the first of the ebb, you will take a 5 hours tide towards Dartmouth, and you will still have 3 hours flood left to get into Dartmouth Harbour."], [119, "CHAPTER XIV. DARTMOUTH TO PLYMOUTH. \" There was the speedy Tamar, which divides The Cornish and the Devonshire confines ; Through both whose borders swiftly down it glides, And meeting Plym, to Plymouth thence declines. Spencer's Faerie Queen, THE passage from Dartmouth to Plymouth, although only thirty-two miles, is usually somewhat tedious ; for with a south-west wind it is a beat from Dartmouth to the Start, and with a north-west one it is a beat from the Start to Plymouth, and with a west wind it is a close haul the whole way, with a dead beat from the Start to the Bolt, with almost always a nasty choppy sea to contend against. Con sequently, unless one is favoured with some east in the wind, the passage is sure to be a long thrash. This being so, it is a convenient plan to make two trips of it, taking the beautiful harbour of Salcombe on the way. Starting from Dartmouth about four hours after high water there, we shall get a good five hours main channel ebb outside, and shall also be sure of getting a flood tide into Salcombe. As we pass between the castles, we see, on the starboard bow, a low islet called the Western Blackstone. It is safer to pass outside of this, but there is a good five feet between it and the land at L.W.S., and it is steep-to. After passing it, a black and white buoy is seen about half a mile S.S.W. This is the Homestone buoy, which marks a small and isolated patch of rock, with only four feet on it at low water. The buoy is moored about one hundred and fifty yards S.E. by E. of the rock. There is a wide passage between it and the land, and the rock may always be avoided by remembering that Kings wear Castle seen right over the centre of the Western Blackstone crosses it. On the landward side, between the Western Blackstone and the Homestone, there are several dangers, but these do not occur until we are past Compass Cove, whence runs the cable to the Channel Islands. After passing this cove, keep"], [120, "DARTMOUTH TO PLYMOUTH. 100 Kingswear Castle open of Blackstone point (i.e., the point of the shore off the Western Blackstone), and this will clear the dangerous Mag rocks, which dry about half ebb, and the equally dangerous outer Combe rock. All these dangers will be passed when the Homestone buoy is on with the Mew stone, and after that the shore is free from dangers right down to Start point. But although the shore may be approached quite closely, there is a very notable danger about a mile away from it, namely, the Skerries Bank, which stretches from opposite Slapton Sands almost down to the Start, a distance of some three and a half miles. This shoal is now marked at its northern extremity by a large bell buoy, but its southern extremity off the point is unmarked, and as this is the shoalest end (having barely nine feet on it) we must be careful not to cross it there at or near low water. I say this emphatically even with regard to yachts of only five or six feet draught, because of the curious and to me inexplicable ground sea which at times rolls in from the Atlantic, and breaks over the south end of the Skerries with astounding fury. I have myself witnessed this phenomenon when I have been sailing down the bay in perfectly smooth water. Suddenly the horizon seemed to heave, and roller after roller swept over the shoal, till, in the grand words of Tennyson : \u2014 \" At last a ninth one, mightier than the rest, And full of voices, slowly rose and plunged Roaring.\" After that the sea subsided, and for ten minutes or more there was no signs of any disturbance. Then the rollers recom menced, and the former scene was repeated. It will be seen, therefore, that the south end of the Skerries is a most treacherous spot, for if one of these grand fellows were to sweep down upon us and break into our mainsail, we should be in a truly ' ' parlous state. \" More than one trawler has been caught, and has never been seen again. As the wind is S.W., we will beat down inside the Skerries. After passing the Combe rocks (curious pillar-like shafts ashore, with nasty needles appearing here and there above the surface of the sea), which lie about west of the Homestone"], [121, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 101 buoy, we soon come opposite to Blackpool, a pretty little cove with a sandy beach. On the top of the cliff to the. northwar of this cove, is seen Stoke Fleming church, while that of Street caps the still loftier precipice on the southern sid\" This part of the bay is very fine, the slate rocks rising to a height of over four hundred and fifty feet. After passing Street, the land suddenly dips down to Slapton Sands, which run for a distance of three miles, and end in the village of Torcross. Slapton Sands are very peculiar, and in configuration bear a strong resemblance to the Chesil Beach on the opposite shore of Lyme Bay. Here, as there, the beach is quite steep-to ; so much so indeed, that you can sail, in three fathoms, near enough to throw a biscuit ashore, and the local excursion steamer, drawing eight or nine feet of water, habitually runs stem on to the beach, and lands her passengers by means of a gangway over the bow ! On the crest of the beach, not above two to three hundred yards from the sea, is a large lake or mere, similar in situation to the Fleet Water at Chesil Beach, only here the water is quite fresh, and teems with various kind of fish, particularly pike. A day's fishing at Slapton Mere is considered one of the sporting tit-bits of the west, and may be had for a very small fee, by applying at the Slapton Sands Hotel, which is situated in the middle of the sands. Torcross, at the south-west end of the sands and Lea, may be known by its houses, and by a curious isolated rock stand ing on the beach. As a ledge runs out some little distance from the shore here, we must give it a fair berth. Sailing on, we pass successively Beesands and Hall Sands, fishing villages of small size, mainly inhabited by \" Crabbers.\" At Hall Sands, in easterly gales, the sea is said to be terrific, and a breed of dogs has for many years been kept by the fishermen for the purpose of swimming out to in-coming boats with a line, by which means the boats are safely hauled through the breakers on to the beach. This is not a mere yarn, but actual fact. We are now close under the Start, and at the entrance of the short passage between it and the Skerries. This passage is about half a mile wide, and the same distance in length."], [122, "DARTMOUTH TO PLYMOUTH. 102 On the Start side, the land is bold, and may be approached quite close. On the Skerries side, it suddenly shoals from nine fathoms to four. Consequently, by keeping the lead going, and putting round directly we get into anything less than say seven fathoms, we shall avoid the bank. The tide at this point runs very strong out of the bay towards the south, and, off the point, this is met at right angles by the main channel ebb, with the usual consequence \u2014 a very nasty race. Moreover, the ground between the Start and the Prawl (some four miles), is very rough and uneven, and I know of no place in the Channel (with the sole exception of Portland Bill) where such vicious, high, and broken seas are met with, as in these four miles. Indeed, although Portland while it lasts is worse, yet, having regard to the area occupied by Start Race, and the impossibility of avoiding it, except by standing right out to sea, I am not sure that the Start is not a more troublesome headland to weather than the Bill. I scarcely ever rounded it, even in quite moderate winds, without finding : \u2014 \" This way and that the leaden seas were hurled, Moved by no wind but by some unseen power.\"* We, therefore, must make up our minds to a bit of a tumble as we round the point. Off the Start are several detached rocks, which however all shew, and we must pass to seaward of them. After rounding them, there are several other submerged ones between us and the shore, notably the Pear Tree rock, which has more than once been fatal to vessels. Therefore, we must give the shore a berth of a quarter of a mile, right away to Prawl point, keeping especially a sharp look out for the Mag rocks, which run out in the form of a serrated reef from the shore, about three quarters of the distance between the Start and Prawl. Prawl point is a splendid headland, both in form and colour, and were it not for the propinquity of the magnificent Bolt Head on the other side of the entrance into Salcombe, it would probably be considered one of the finest bits of cliff scenery in the west country. As it is, the entrance to * W. Morris."], [123, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 103 Salcombe, guarded by these two great heads, is decidedly unsurpassed by any river entrance that I have ever visited. Prawl point is a bluff and precipitous headland, which rises sheer from the sea to the height of between two and three hundred feet. Its true colour is dark grey, but, owing either to lichens or metallic discolouration, it is dabbled with the most lovely sage greens and yellows. Like all slate cliffs, it is split into caves and hollows, and jagged pinnacles, while a magnificent natural arch shews where the almost ever tur bulent sea has nearly succeeded in tearing away a large piece of the cliff from the main body. Off the S.W. side of the point, at a distance of perhaps sixty yards, is a small islet; and two hundred yards further out still, is a dangerous submerged rock with only ten feet on it. There are similar rocks at intervals all along the east side of the entrance, but none of them have less than ten feet on them, and they may all be avoided by keeping one-third of a mile (say three cables) off the shore. This side should however be avoided between half-ebb and half-flood, because the shallowest water on the bar is found there. We will therefore, having rounded the Prawl, make straight for the little Eelstone, which lies under Salcombe Head, and bears N.W. from a point two cables S.W. of Prawl signal cabin. As we approach Salcombe Head (part of Bolt Head), its magnificent form becomes more apparent. It is said to be about four hundred and thirty feet in height, but it looks very much more. Its base is hollowed out into numerous caverns, into which the sea dashes, while the profile of the Head, after rising some forty or fifty feet sheer from the water, slopes back at an angle of about forty-five degrees in one long upward sweep, broken in the most fantastic way into numerous pinnacles and needles, which remind one forcibly of the Aiguilles, ot the valley of Chamounix. I do not think that any headland in the Channel is so impressive as this. Having arrived near to the little Eelstone, we must, if it is anywhere near low water, hug the shore, so as to cross the bar in the best water, which is only eight feet. The bar runs from three hundred yards N. of the little Eelstone in an E. by N. direction, right across the harbour mouth, towards a ruddy"], [124, "DARTMOUTH TO PLYMOUTH. 104 bit of cliff which is easily recognised. On the seaward side of the bar will be found two and a half to three and a half fathoms, but, on the bar itself, the depth varies from three feet on the east side, to ten feet on the west ; but, even there, there are two six foot patches. To avoid these, keep the eastern edge of Molt point (which has a good white house on it facing the sea) on with the middle of a clump of trees in the garden of another white house half a mile or so behind it, N. by E. ; or bring the west end of Molt House N. \\ E., and steer direct for it until the water deepens, when you may steer for the battery behind the beacon. When past the Wolf rock red buoy, which must be passed on the western side, we steer between the three beacons on the north shore, and the beacon on the dangerous- looking Blackstone rock, which lies on the south eastern shore, after which the proper course is mid-river. If we had been obliged to beat up the river, it would have been necessary to take short tacks, as it is shoal on both sides, but particularly in Mill Bay, whence a flat stretches out nearly half-way across the river, while, on the opposite shore, a nasty reef runs out to meet it. At this point the channel is scarcely a hundred and fifty yards in breadth. It would, therefore, have been necessary to keep the lead going, and to have gone round whenever we shoaled to less than fourteen feet, as the banks are very steep. There are some very handsome private houses and a good hotel, on the Salcombe or north-western shore, and one very pretty house in a cove on the south-eastern or Portlemouth shore ; but otherwise Salcombe and Portlemouth are poorly built places, with no conveniences for getting stores of any kind. This, no doubt, is owing to the fact that there is no railway within fifteen miles, a statement which, in these days of steam, may sound somewhat extraordinary. If anything beyond the mere necessaries of life is required, one is obliged either to row, or take the curious wheezy old steamer, to Kingsbridge, four miles up the river, which is a town some what, but not very appreciably, more lively than Salcombe. Most yachts anchor off the hotel or the coastguard station ; but, personally I prefer to go a little higher up, off"], [125, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 105 Ditch End, where the tide does not run quite so strong, and where the voices of the local dogs (who perhaps from ennui caused by the remote situation of the place, bark and howl at night with amazing persistency) are not quite so much en evidence. There can be no doubt that if Salcombe were more readily accessible, it would become a very favourite watering place ; for it is not only beautifully situated, but has good sandy coves for bathing, pleasant walks, first-rate fishing in the bay and on the bar, and a climate said to be the most equable in England, where oranges and lemons, aloes and myrtles, grow, bloom and fructify in the open air; but until quite lately, even if a visitor managed to get there (except in a yacht), he found nowhere to lay his head. Now, however, a really nice hotel has been started, and it will no doubt do something towards attracting visitors to the place. Having passed a few days in these quiet waters, and taken a walk up Salcombe Head, from which a magnificent view of the Channel is obtained, and perhaps a stroll to the Prawl or Start, let us get up our anchor about half ebb, so as to catch the first of the Channel ebb outside. Passing over the bar, at the same spot as before, we pro ceed along the base of Salcombe Head, at a distance of a cable, keeping Molt point on a N. by E. bearing, until the great Eelstone is brought well on the starboard quarter. We shall thus miss a nasty two feet rock, which lies a cable's length to the S.E. of it. We can now make a course for the great and little Mewstones, which may be passed close to, under the shadow of Bolt Head. From the Bolt Head to the Bolt Tail, a distance of six miles, the coast is magnificent ; but, as it is fringed with dangerous rocks, such as the Gregories, it is necessary to keep about a mile off the land, or, in other words, to keep the signal station on the Prawl well open of the little Mewstone. Bolt Tail is situated at the entrance of Bigbury Bay, which is a large and somewhat deep bay, measuring seven miles across. Two rivers empty themselves into it, namely the Avon and the Ernie, but they are wholly unsuited for yachts, as they dry right across at low water, and the entrances are fringed"], [126, "106 DARTMOUTH TO PLYMOUTH. and strewed with rocks. It is therefore the invariable practice to make a N.W. \\ W. course right across the bay for the entrance to Plymouth Sound. These seven miles have always appeared to me to be the longest seven miles on the coast, probably owing to the fact that the shore being distant, one does not appreciate one's rate of sailing to the same extent as would be the case if the shore were seen to be rapidly passed. However, in due time, we get across to Stoke point, and soon reel off the three miles between there and the Plymouth Mewstone, a large pyramidal islet which is easily recognised. Between the Mewstone and Yealm Head lies Wembury Bay, and into this bay, due east of the Mewstone, flows the river Yealm, one of the most delightful little havens in the Channel. A stranger can scarcely believe that any entrance exists until he is close up to it. A nasty bar, which dries at low water, stretches from the north shore to within twenty yards of the south side. The channel, therefore, hugs the southern shore until a point, known by the dismal name of Misery point, is reached ; and from thence the deep water is about mid-river until well round the point, when it runs into the bay on the south side again. This is the place to bring up, and when once inside, we find ourselves in a completely land-locked basin, about three hundred yards in diameter. At the bottom end of this basin, the river branches into two arms, that on the left becoming the beautiful river Kitley, flowing past the seat of Lord Revelstoke, and up to Yealmton, and the other (a mere creek), leading between the pretty villages of Noss and Newton Ferrers. On ordinary days, you can scarcely imagine that you are within three or four miles of a large town like Plymouth, so sequestered is this little harbour ; but occasionally, an excursion steamer roughly reminds you that the \" madding crowd \" is not far distant. The Kitley and Noss Creek, can only safely be navigated in a small boat, so that no attempt must be made to take the yacht higher than the basin above referred to. Sailing past the Mewstone, we must be careful to keep out side the red buoy which marks the end of a ledge running out from the islet ; but when this is passed, a course may be made"], [127, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 107 towards the centre of the breakwater, which will take us safely outside the Shagstone (now beaconed), where the ill-fated P. and O. steamer \" Nepaul,\" went down some two years or so back. Having passed the beacon on the east end of the break water, we are in the famous Plymouth Sound, one of the finest harbours in Europe, and the paradise of the smooth water sailor. There are very few shoals in the Sound which need be avoided by a yacht ; and the various buoys, which look rather alarming to a stranger, are, for the most part, only placed there for the benefit of men-of-war or such huge craft. Practically, the east side of the Sound may be approached, in three fathoms and over, to within a cable's length (two hundred yards) or less. The same remark applies to the western side, from Penlee buoy round Cawsand Bay up to the South Bridge buoy, which lies about half a mile south of Drake's Island. The shores of Drake's Island itself, and the space between it and Mount Edgcomb, are, however, shoal and dangerous, and the yachtsman should keep outside the line joining the South Bridge buoy and the Melampus buoy and Asia buoy (N.E. of Drake's Island). If the yacht draw more than nine feet, it is also necessary, at or near L.W S., to avoid the Mallard and Winter Shoals, The former is a twelve feet rock, lying about two cables (say four hundred yards) W.N.W. of the Catwater breakwater head, and has a black buoy on its N.W. side. The latter (Winter) is a ten feet rock about one hundred yards square, lying midway between Drake's Island and the Catwater breakwater, and is marked with three buoys. With the exception of these shoals, there is nothing inside the breakwater to hurt a yacht drawing less than fifteen feet. Outside the breakwater, there are various buoys, but they all mark rocks with fifteen feet and upwards on them at L.W.S., such as the Tinker, the Panther, and the Knap. The only exceptions are the Shagstone (already referred to), which is beaconed, and the Draystone, which lies about three hundred yards off Penlee point, and is indicated by a red and white buoy moored outside it. Once in the Sound, we have a choice of anchorages. The calmest is undoubtedly the Catwater, as the mouth of the"], [128, "108 DARTMOUTH TO PLYMOUTH. river Laira is called, situated in the N.E. corner of the Sound, and protected by a subsidiary breakwater of its own. If, however, the wind be N. or N.E., the stench from the fishing harbour, known as Sutton Pool, and from some chemical works, is truly terrible. Moreover, the only available landing place for Plymouth is at Sutton Pool, right in the slums, and among all the fishing craft, where steps and roadway are slimy and reeking with dead fish, and craft of all sorts are continually moving to and fro, to the not inconsiderable danger of yachts dingeys. However, although smelly, Sutton Pool is undoubtedly picturesque in the extreme, and although its denizens may at first sight seem rough, they are as fine, and hearty, and honest a set of fellows as you will find anywhere, and I confess to entertaing a strong admiration for them. Another anchorage is off the Promenade pier, under the Hoe. This is a good place in northerly winds, but if the breeze chips round to the southward, we should have a lively night of it. A third anchorage is close under the shelter of the north side of Drake's Island, but this is apt to be rather roily. On the whole, the Catwater, with all its drawbacks, is the best place for a small yacht ; but it is much to be regretted that Plymouth does not afford better yacht anchorage, as it is a splendid yachting centre, a fine town, and a most interesting neighbourhood. The climate of the town itself is relaxing, owing to the fact that it is built on the north slope of a hill, by which it is sheltered from the sea breezes. The sea front of this hill is called the Hoe, and is laid out in terraces as a public pro menade. It affords a magnificent view of the harbour and its tributary rivers, with the Eddystone lighthouse in the far background. It was on the Hoe, that Drake was playing the historic game of bowls when the great Armada was sighted. The eastern end of the Hoe is occupied by the Citadel, and the western end of the crest of the hill is surmounted by the fine club-house of the Royal Western Yacht Club, and the Grand Hotel ; while in the middle is now re-erected Smeaton's famous Eddystone lighthouse, which has, during the past few years, been removed from the rock which had"], [129, "OUR SILVER STREAK. log become too weak to bear it. Opposite the Hoe, the celebrated breakwater lies for a mile across the Sound, while, in the fore ground, is seen the highly fortified Drake's Island. On the right, the river Tamar separates Devon from Cornwall, and, on the Cornish shore, are seen the lovely glades and woods of Mount Edgcombe park, stretching away towards Penlee point. On the left is the Catwater \u2014 the entrance to the river Laira \u2014 its southern side guarded by the little hill called Mount Batten, whence runs the subsidiary breakwater above referred to, the extremity of which is, at night, furnished with an excellent winking light. That which is colloquially called Plymouth, is in reality composed of three distinct communities, viz., Devonport to the west, Plymouth in the middle, and Stonehouseto the east. There is also a suburb to the north of Stonehouse called Stoke Daverel, situated much higher than Plymouth. Taken together, the three towns cannot number less than one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants. There is a good theatre, and a good promenade pier at Plymouth, at the latter of which the various military bands of the garrison play every night. There are also frequent organ recitals at the Guildhall, a very fine modern building in the centre of the town, and divers other amusements are continually going on ; for Plymouth has a large garrison, and Mars demands that time shall not be allowed to hang heavily on his hands. There are also frequent regattas and sailing matches, as, in addition to the Royal Western, there are the Royal Plymouth Corinthian and Royal South Western Clubs, both of which are extremely sporting institutions. There is good fishing in the harbour, and ex cellent whiting fishing off the Eddystone. Excursion steamers run daily to various places of interest, such as the Yealm, Salcombe, Looe, and Fowey, the Eddystone lighthouse, and up the river Tamar. On Wednesdays Mount Edgcombe Park is thrown open, but no yachtsman will find any difficulty in getting leave to visit it on other days, if he applies at the Manor Office, Emma Place, Stonehouse. The entrance to the park is at Cremyll, just inside the Tamar. It is said that the Duke of Medina Sidonia, the Commander of the great Armada, had fixed upon"], [130, "DARTMOUTH TO PLYMOUTH. 110 Mount Edgcumbe as his share of the spoil ; and certainly he showed no mean taste in his choice, for probably it is sur passed in beauty by no nobleman's park in Britain. By leaving the park near to Maker church, a road will be found leading to Cawsand, whence the vigorous pedestrian may pursue his course to Penlee and Rame Head, with its curious and extremely ancient chapel. An excursion up the Tamar, is considered one of the things never to be omitted by the visitor to Plymouth ; and in truth it is a very lovely trip. Unless, however, the yachtsman possesses a steam launch, it is necessary to have recourse to the excursion steamer, as it is pretty well thirty miles up to Calstock and back, and it is in the upper reaches that the grandest scenery occurs. Rounding Devil's point (at the entrance of the river), where the tide runs furiously, the vessel enters Hamoaze, the great naval anchorage of the west, crowded with men-of-war of all sorts and descriptions, from the newest turret ships to the old three decker. On the starboard hand is Devonport, with its great naval building sheds, gunwharf, and dockyard. Just beyond the dockyard, but on the other bank of the river, the estuary of the Lynher mingles its waters with those of the Tamar, Antony House, the seat of W. H. P. Carew, Esq., being situated at the junction, while, opposite to it, is the ancient castle of Trematon. We now come in view of Brunei's great work, Saltash railway bridge, which hangs at a height of a hundred and seventy feet above the water. The river here widens considerably, but soon contracts again, until, at Pentillie castle, it is very narrow indeed. Proceeding onwards, we soon come to Cothele quay, the landing place for Cothele House, said to be one of the most interesting mansions in England. It is the dower house of the Edgcumbe family, and access to it may generally be obtained, by previous appli cation at the Manor Office at Stonehouse. It contains many interesting and ancient relics, for a description of which I must refer you to the ordinary guide books. The grandest part of the Tamar, is between Calstock and Weir Head, four miles above, where there is a deep gorge, so narrow that the vessel brushes the branches of the trees, while,"], [131, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 111 on the Devon side, the river is bounded by a precipice called the Morwell rocks, rising sheer from the waters edge to the height of three hundred feet. In addition to this trip up the Tamar, the visitor to Plymouth can drive, or go by railway, to Prince's Town, in the very heart of Dartmoor, where the great convict estab lishment is situated. The Moor is a very curious district, and this trip is well worth making. One may also go by railway to Ivybridge, Tavistock, or Okehampton, all lying on the fringe of the Moor, and all full of beautiful scenes. Saltram, the seat of the Earl of Morley, is another show place. The entrance is close to Laira bridge, which is a short row from the Catwater. It is said to contain the finest collection of Sir Joshua's, in Europe, together with many other important works of the old masters. Plymouth, like Dartmouth, is an ancient place. At the end of the thirteenth century, it was represented in Parliament by two members, and in the middle of the fourteenth (1347), it furnished Edward III. with twenty ships for the siege of Calais, whereas Liverpool only furnished one. Dartmouth, however, furnished thirty-one, which shews that, ancient as is the lineage of Plymouth that of Dartmouth is more ancient still. As in the case of Dartmouth, so in that of Plymouth, the French have more than once landed at night, and burnt whole quarters of the town.* This was, however, not borne with equanimity, for a local worthy named Wilford, gathered some vessels together, and landing in Brittany, took forty ships laden with merchandise, destroyed thirty more, and fired many towns along the coast. Plymouth became an incorporated borough in 1439, and its municipal buildings (modern) are quite the finest in the west of England, and should certainly be visited. The great lion of Plymouth is the breakwater, built by Rennie between 1812 and 1841. It is a gigantic work, a mile in length, with a breadth of thirty feet on the top, but its base is probably ten times as much. It cannot, however, be compared with the similar work at Cherbourg. Plymouth harbour is very strongly fortified, as indeed it ought to be, for it is one of the most Dr. Doran's \"Memories of Our Great Towns.\""], [132, "112 DARTMOUTH TO PLYMOUTH. important, if not the most important, of our naval arsenals. Forts frown upon one from every side, and it is said that by means of telephonic communication, and a system of mapping out the Sound into squares, the commanding officer can train the guns of all the forts on to any particular section, with fatal results to any vessel which might happen to be within that section at the time. The dockyard at Devonport cannot fail to be interesting to every yachtsman ; it is open, during working hours, to all British subjects, on application at the gates. A visit there should by no means be omitted. At the Plymouth Library, in Cornwall Street, is the Cottonian Collection of sketches, prints, and paintings, including works of many of the old masters ; while at the Athenaeum will be found a good collection of birds, fishes, bones, minerals and antiquities. Of late an Aquarium has been erected on the Hoe, at the Biological Institute, to which admission may be gained by payment of sixpence. It will be seen, therefore, that, but for its disagreeable anchorages, Plymouth is a harbour where one could gladly spend a week or even more. NOTES ON PILOTAGE. (i.) Magnetic Courses and Distances.

FROM Plymouth to Falmouth is only forty miles, but inasmuch as Fowey is a very pretty harbour and a good anchorage, it is usual to break the journey there. Leaving Plymouth by the western entrance, the only danger which we have to guard against is the Draystone which lies off Penlee point. A red and white buoy is placed about a hundred yards outside it, and, by keeping to the eastward and south ward of this buoy, the stone will be avoided. After passing Penlee, the course is about west up to Rame Head, a curious headland of a pyramidal form, united to the mainland by a narrow isthmus. Rounding this, we find ourselves in White sand Bay, which stretches thence as far as Looe Island, distant some nine miles. There is nothing of much interest in this bay, no harbours and no dangers ; but in north-west or north winds it affords quiet anchorage close to the shore. Looe, which lies at the north-west corner of the bay, is a little fishing port, quite unsuited for yachts, as it dries com pletely out, and is only one hundred and fifty feet wide. Looe Island is situated just off the entrance to the port, and shields it from south-west gales. It is a prominent object in the landscape, being, like so many of the South Devon and Cornish islets, of a pyramidal shape, and covered with bright green vegetation. It is about one hundred and fifty feet high, and half a mile round. Looe Island must not be approached too closely, as it is fringed with reefs for pretty well a quarter of a mile. At all events, the \" Rennies\" extend that far south eastward of it. The red and white ringed tower on Gribben Head (just beyond Fowey), kept well open of the cliffs beyond Polperro, will clear the Rennies. This tower on the Gribben is an excellent landmark, and, in clear weather, is visible for nearly twenty miles. Fowey is situated just to the eastward of it."], [135, ""], [136, ""], [137, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 115 After passing Looe Island, the coast becomes very bold and magnificent, forming a series of wild bays, for seven and a half miles, as far as Fowey. At a distance of two and a half miles from Looe, is the romantic little haven of Polperro; but no yacht should attempt it, as it dries out, and is so small that it is only fit to hold the fishing boats which hail from the place. A visit should, however, be made to Polperro from Fowey, either in a local open boat, or by road (six miles). Between Looe and Fowey entrance, the shore may be approached to within a quarter of a mile, with the sole excep tion of one spot. This spot is just about half way between Polperro and Fowey, where there is a most dangerous rock called the Udder, lying half a mile off the shore, and shewing about two feet at L.W.S. A beacon is placed on the shore abreast of the rock, and when this beacon is on with a white washed rock called the Shag, the Udder is directly between you and them. To pass outside the Udder, we must keep Looe Island open of the point to the westward of it, called Orestone Point. We now rapidly approach the entrance to Fowey ; but, until we round Polruan Head (which guards the east side of the entrance), it is difficult to believe that such a place exists. As, however, we came abreast the head, the houses of Fowey appear one by one, until at last the whole of the quaint little town is disclosed to the view. The entrance to Fowey is fairly deep, and free from dangers, except that, on the east side, a reef of rocks (nearly, if not always, above water) runs out from the shore for some distance. These rocks have a white beacon, in the form of a cross, on them, and the water in their neighbourhood is shoal to a fathom at L.W.S. Perhaps the best guide for entering, is to keep Fowey town quay (just below the church) well open of the Polruan shore, which will lead clear of all dangers on the east side, and to keep the church tower open of a conspicuous white house on the river's edge, below the large red hotel, which will lead clear of all dangers on the west side. Directly, however, we pass the narrows (or, in other words, the old ruined castle on Polruan point), the river becomes very shoal on both sides, but particularly on the Polruan shore, where a large bank makes"], [138, "116 PLYMOUTH TO FALMOUTH. a convex sweep from Polruan Castle to the entrance to Pont Pill, a creek on the east side of the harbour. On this bank, there is only about three feet at L.W.S. ; and, indeed, at those times, the best water in the channel, which is scarcely half a cable in width, is only nine to ten feet. The mark for the best water is to keep St. Catherine's point, at the entrance, W.S.W. \\ S. Yachts of heavy draught must either anchor close to the entrance, off Polruan Castle, or go well up past the town, where there is much more water. A yacht drawing eight feet can, however, bring up at the entrance of Pont Pill, at neaps, with the church bearing N.W. | N. Fowey is a very foreign-looking town, with streets so irregular, narrow, and full of angles, that two carriages can scarcely pass in them. It is built up the side of a steep hill, somewhat after the manner of Dartmouth, but on a much smaller scale. The church is a spacious and lofty fabric, with a handsome tower; and, from the architecture, and the fact of some of the keystones of the arches being decorated with roses, it is believed to date from the time of the fourth Edward. It contains several curious, but not very artistic, monuments of past generations of Treffrys, Rashleighs, and Grahams the great people of the neighbourhood. On the north side of the church, and close to the burial ground, on an eminence connected with the latter by a flight of steps, is \" the glorie of the town,\" as old Leland calls it, viz., \" Place,\" the historic seat of the Treffrys. Leland, writing in the time of Henry VIII., mentions it in the following quaint terms:\" \"The Frenchmen diverse tymes assailed this town, and last most notably about Henry the VI. tyme, when the wife of Thomas Treury the II., with her men, repelled the French out of her house in her husband's absence ; whereupon Thomas Treury builded a righte faire and strongly embateld towr in his house, and embatteling al the waulles of the house, in a manner made it a castelle.\" The same author says : \" The glory of Fowey rose by the warres in King Edward the First and Thirde, and Henry the V. day, partely by feats of warre, * Norden, writing in the reign of Elizabeth or James I., speaks of it as \"an auntient howse, castelwise builded.\""], [139, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 117 partely by pyracie, and so waxing rich fell al to merchandice, so that the town was hauntid with shippes of diverse nations, and their shippes went to al nations. The shippes of Fowey sailing by Rhie and Winchelsey about Edward III. tyme, would vale no bonet beyny required ; whereupon Rhie and Winchelsey men and they fought, when Fowey men had the victorie, and thereupon bare their armes mixt with the armes of Rhie and Winchelsey, and then rose the name of the gallants of Fowey,\" \u2014 a name, be it remembered, of which the in habitants are proud to this day, \" When warre in Edward the IV. days seased bytwene the Frenchmen and Englisch, the men of Fowey used to pray,\" (prey not worship) \" kept thir shippes, and assalid the Frenchmen in the sea, agaynst King Edward's commandment, whereupon the captaines of the shippes of Fowey were taken and sent to London, and Darte mouth men commanded to fetch thir shippes away, at whyche tyme Dartemouth men tooke away, as it is sayde, the greate chaine that was drawen over the haven from towr to towr.\" Carew, in his \" Survey of Cornwall,\" says that this caused the trade of the town to decay, but that it was once more renovated through \" the commendable desserts of Master Rashleigh the elder (descended from a younger brother of an ancient house in Devon), whose industrious judgment and adventuring in trade of merchandize, first opened a light and way to the townesmens new thriving, and left his sonne large wealth and possessions.\" The Rashleighs are still great people at Fowey, and their seat of Menabilly (mentioned by Norden at the end of the sixteenth century) is quite a show place. The shipping trade of Fowey is still extensive, inasmuch as it is one of the chief ports for the shipment of china clay. Fowey is also renowned for its pilchard fishery, an ancient industry lauded by Norden in his \"History of Cornwall,\" written in the reign of Elizabeth or James I. Speaking of it, he says : \" The most comodious fishe and richeste fishinge is of the leaste fishe, which is called a pylcharde ; which kynde infinitelie aboundeth upon the sea coaste of this countrie,\" and \" are taken of the countrie fishermen in suche aboundante manner as, unless a man see the admirable draughtes, he"], [140, "118 PLYMOUTH TO FALMOUTH. will hardly believe what is daylie seene. In a baye called Trewardrayth Baye, I sawe one drawghte that frawghted sixteen boates in Foy, besides the aboundance which the countrie people carried awaye in baskets, supposed to be in the whole nere twentie tunn of fishe. The comoditie that ariseth of this silly smal fishe is wounderfull, first to the fishermen themselves in respecte of their sale, as well to the countrie people for their reliefe, as to the marchaunt whoe maketh againe great marte of them in kingdoms and countries remote.\" It is currently reported that many Fowey pilchards are still made \" greate marte of in kingdoms and countries remote,\" and that they return to England under the guise of sardines. Leaving Fowey, we proceed to sea much in the same way as we entered ; but, after passing Punch Cross, there is, just off Gribben Head, a most dangerous rock known as the Cannis, which assuredly ought to be buoyed or beaconed, more especially as there can be no real difficulty in erecting a sufficient beacon upon it. This abominable rock, which is covered between three-quarter flood and quarter ebb, is situated about quarter a of a mile from the Gribben, and there is a ten foot passage between them. There are two marks for clearing the Cannis, viz., Fowey church tower on with (or open of) St. Catherine's point, or the Dodman Head kept to seaward of an islet called the Gwineas rock, lying between Fowey and the Dodman. At night, a red light (shewn on a conspicuous white house at Fowey), kept open of St. Catherine's point, will lead clear of the rock. After passing the Cannis, we are in the beautiful bay of Tywardreath or St. Austell. This bay is very like a magnified Torbay ; and, on a fine day, with its varied outlines, and diverse colouring, and the deep blue Cornish sea as a fore ground, it makes as pretty a marine picture as one could wish to look upon. There are no yachting harbours in St. Austell bay, as they all dry except Pentuan, where there is a little floating basin, fit for small merchant vessels. In the north corner of the bay is Par, with the copper smelting town of St. Blazey behind it ; St. Austell and Charlestown lie in the north-west angle of the bay, north of"], [141, "Cur silver streak. 119 Blackhead; while Pentuan, Mevagissey and Gorran haven are situated to the south of that head, the latter place being close to the Dodman. About two miles before we reach the Dodman, we pass the Gwineas rock above referred to, with its subsidiary islets. It may be passed safely within a cable's length, or less. The Dodman is one of the most conspicuous headlands in the west country. Being three hundred and sixty feet high, and of bold proportions, it is visible for a long distance \u2014 indeed, in clear weather, from Plymouth on the east, to off the Lizard on the west. It is said that, in bad weather, there are nasty overfalls off the head, but although I have many times rounded it in fair weather and foul, I have never found anything very bad there, except squalls, which do occasionally whistle down, with very considerable force, in its neighbour hood, and sometimes necessitate a frequent use of the tricing line, and even of the peak halyards. Passing the Dodman, the coast line becomes visible as far as Blackhead, near to the Lizard, and a very beautiful coast it is. We now find ourselves in Veryan bay, the only dangers in which are rocks known as the Gull, the Whelps, and the Lath. The Gull (situated off Penare Head) can scarcely be considered a danger, because it is an islet some one hundred and twenty-five feet high, and therefore sufficiently visible. The Whelps, however, are dangerous, being a series of detached rocks, which cover at from quarter to three-quarter flood. They lie between a quarter and half a mile S.W. \\ S. from the Gull. The Lath rock, with seven feet least water, is one and a half miles E. by N. \\ N. of the Gull. All these dangers may be avoided by keeping the square tower of Mawnan church, at the entrance of the river Helford, open of St. Anthony's point, or the high land at Looe open of the Dodman. After passing Penare Head and the Gull, we leave Veryan, and enter upon Gerran bay (in which there are no dangers), and rapidly approach Killygerran head. From there to Zoze point, a distance of i\\ miles, the cliffs may be approached to a quarter of a mile, but within that distance there are several sunken rocks."], [142, "120 PLYMOUTH TO FALMOUTH. Rounding Zoze point, the magnificent harbour of Fal mouth bursts with startling suddenness upon our view, the wide entrance being bounded on the east by St. Anthony's point and lighthouse, and on the west by the promontory of Pendennis, surmounted by its ancient castle. Between the two, a hideous black iron beacon marks the black rock which divides the channel into two. Both sides of the entrance are steep, until past St. Mawes castle on the east side, and Pendennis castle on the west. After that, one ought (strictly speaking) to keep to the eastward of the \"Governor\" black and white buoy, but as there is over two fathoms within two cables to the west of it, a yacht may safely \"borrow\" some what. After passing the Govenor, one may sail in one and a half fathoms straight past the pier heads of the commercial harbour, and thence onward to the yacht anchorage off the town in Flushing creek. The town of Falmouth has a decidedly ancient appearance, owing, probably, to the inconvenient narrowness of its main street. It is, however, in reality, a comparatively modern place, dating no further back than 1613, at which time its site was occupied by a village called \" Smithike,\" or \" Penny come-quick.\" The name of Falmouth was accorded to it in the year 1660 by Royal proclamation. Falmouth was built by one Killigrew, and not without opposition from the inhabitants of Truro, Penrhyn, and Helston, who petitioned James I. to inhibit the building of it, on the ground that it would tend to their \" ruin and impoverishment.\" This, however, his Majesty refused to do, on the sound legal ground that \" every man might lawfully do what he would for the utility and advantage of his own proper goods and lands, without the license or approbation even of the King, or any contiguous neighbour, who had no public or private nuisance thereby done him.\" Falmouth itself is a curious and foreign looking town from the water, being built, like Fowey and Dartmouth, up the side of a steep hill ; but when one lands, all its charm disappears, as it has all the squalid and narrow streets of these places, without any of the interesting relics of the past, with which they are endowed. Perhaps the most interesting thing in the place is the old curiosity shop of Mr."], [143, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 121 Burton, which is simply crammed with Eastern curios of all kinds, and over which every visitor to Falmouth is invited to roam at his own sweet will and pleasure, without being bothered to buy anything, unless he chooses. A visit to this shop should certainly not be omitted. Walking past Falmouth church, we come to the narrow isthmus which unites Pendennis with the mainland. On this isthmus, is now built \"the Falmouth Hotel,\" an excellently conducted house, facing the open sea. The steep hill of Pendennis now rises before us, and up this we must certainly toil, for the view from the summit is superb, affording a panorama of the entire harbour and sea coast as far as the Manacles. The castle was built by Henry VIII., and stood a seige by the Parliamentary troops, being only surrendered upon the most honourable terms. On the other side of the harbour, is seen the handsome castle of St. Mawes at the entrance of the creek of that name. It also was the work of the eighth Henry. The present defences, both at Pendennis and St. Mawes, are, of course, modern earthworks, and I believe that they have been recently armed with modern ordnance. The climate of Falmouth is, to most people, decidedly relaxing, as it is protected from the prevailing westerly winds by the high mount of Pendennis ; but a walk up the latter, or on to the sea beach on the isthmus, will afford considerable relief. Ladies can bathe at Swanpool, a little bay near to the isthmus. Another favourite walk is among the woods of Trefusis, on the Flushing side. These are open to the public, and afford very beautiful views of the neighbourhood. Falmouth is a very good centre from which to make driving excursions. Thus, one may go for day trips to Perran Porth on the north coast, twenty miles distant, where the great blue Atlantic rollers thunder on the beach, in a way rarely seen in the Channel, and where antiquarians will find a curious buried church. Another long day's drive is to go to the Lizard and back, taking a short walk from the Lizard to the beautiful and romantic Kynance Cove, well known to the art-loving public as the original of Mr. Brett's \" Cornish Lions,\" where, as Lord Tennyson say, \" Sweet is the colour of cove\u00bb_nd wave,''"], [144, "122 PLYMOUTH TO FALMOUTH. for the latter is bright emerald, breaking on silver sand, and the former is variegated serpentine, draped with lichen of a brilliant golden hue. I suppose that no richer colouring exists in our islands than is to be seen in this little indentation. On certain days, char-a-bancs make the excursion to these places, but private carriages can be hired. Falmouth is not a very nice anchorage, as the town sewers open directly into Flushing Creek, and are at times very offensive, especially when landing. I therefore generally like to bring up on the opposite shore, rather below the little fishing village of Flushing, where the water is cleaner. Another pretty and clean anchorage is in St. Mawes Creek, just off the pier, but in south-west winds this is a roily place. In easterly weather, however, it is perfect, and the country round about is delightful. A yacht can readily be sailed up the river Fal, as far as Tregothnan, the seat of the Earl of Falmouth, by following the directions indicated on the chartlet ; and the beauty of the river up there, and at King Harry's Ferry in the reach below, is charming. I once anchored off Tregothnan boathouse for a week, during which we had a very heavy gale, and found it an excellent anchorage. Cream, eggs, milk and butter, can be procured at a neighbouring farm, by landing at the ferry.

One show'd an iron coast and angry waves ; You seem'd to hear them climb and fall, And roar, rock-thwarted, under bellowing caves, Beneath the windy wall. Tennyson . LET us now leave Falmouth, for a few days fishing in the Helford. Passing close to the wooden piers of the commercial harbour, and giving the western shore a berth of a few hundred yards, we may pass to the west of the beacon on the Black rock, and so gain the open sea. The course from Pendennis point for the Helford is S.W. W., and there are no dangers further from the shore than a quarter of a mile, right down to Rosemullion Head. After that, we must be careful, as a nasty ledge of serrated rocks, called the Gedges, stretches across the mouth of the river Helford from half a mile south-west of Rosemullion Head in a south-east direction. They project pretty nigh half a mile from the shore, and show at and near low water. I know of no really good mark for clearing this reef, but, if you keep Pennance point well open of Rosemullion Head, and bearing N.E. by N. J N., until Mawnan church tower, on the north side of the entrance, is well open N.N.W., you will pass clear of it. After that there are no dangers above a cable's length from each shore, as far as the pretty little village of Durgan, on the north shore, off which one may bring up in westerly winds ; but in easterly ones it is a case of pitching bowsprit under there, so having learnt wisdom by experience, and knowing the fickleness of the elements, we will proceed beyond the bar, and anchor between the villages of Passage and Helford. Opposite Durgan, a reef runs out for perhaps two cables from the south shore, but a mooring buoy belonging to the owner of the large house on that side, sufficiently marks the point where it is necessary to \" down helm.\" The bar itself is a sand bank, which crosses the river, practically speaking, where the telegraph cable crosses it, and this is marked by two"], [147, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 125 posts in the usual way. There is about if fathoms on the bar at L.W.S., and it really presents no difficulty to yachts of moderate draught. The real danger commences after the bar is passed, and consists of a large mud flat, which extends from Passage right across towards Helford village, for perhaps one third the width of the river. A good mark for clearing it is to keep Passage point (a low bank of rock to the east of the village) on with the middle of the trees surrounding Mawnan church (i.e., keep the church well open of Passage point). The apex of the mud is just opposite the ferry hut on the south shore, and from there it slopes backward to the entrance of the creek on the north shore. The best anchorage is about half a cable from the edge of this flat, rather nearer to the creek than to Passage, with the above-mentioned hut bearing about S. W. In beating, keep the lead going, and do not approach too near the shore, as it is very shoal in Helford Creek. A good mark is to keep a little grey house on Constantine point open of the point west of the ferry hut. The Helford is the Paradise of salt water fishers, for it is the chosen home of that woodcock of the sea \u2014 the red mullet. I myself have caught over 120 in one haul of the seine there, and at the second haul, although there were no mullet, yet enough fish of other kinds were secured to fill a twelve-foot dingey above the thwarts. It is, however, only fair to say that the local fisherman (honest Thomas Downing,* of Durgan) from whom we hired the seine, said that our luck was phenomenal ; at least if he did not say that, he expressed the same idea. Still, as a rule, there is no doubt that the Helford swarms with fish. In saying this, I do not wish to encourage that which is (I regret to say) already too common in this remote haven, namely, the descent upon it of some selfish yacht owner, who, by means of continuous trawling, seining, and tramelling, makes a clean sweep of all the fish, leaving nothing either for the poor inhabitants of the adjacent villages, or for his brother yachtsmen, for days, or sometimes weeks, together. The river proceeds for a long way past our anchorage, branching out various arms to right and left ; but although a * I can strongly recommend this man."], [148, "126 FALMOUTH TO PENZANCE. yacht could proceed some distance up the stream, it is not advisable, and those who desire to investigate it should make use of the dingey or gig. The Helford is \" far from the madding crowd,\" the nearest town (Falmouth) being a good six miles away. There is, however, a post office at Helford village, kept by Mrs. Bly, a most obliging lady, who also sells poultry and eggs, and takes in yachts washing. There is, however, no telegraph office, which is a matter of regret, inasmuch as many yachts anchor here in the summer months. and a wire would soon pay for itself. Many pretty walks are to be found in the neighbourhood, either starting from Helford village, Passage, or Durgan ; and a row or sail in the dingey up Manaccan (or Anthony's) Creel:, opens up a vision of beauty. Readers of Kingsley's \" Here ward the Wake,\" will remember how the hero sailed into the Helford, \" over a rolling bar, between jagged points of black rock, and up a tide river, which wandered and branched away inland like a land-locked lake, between high green walls of oak and ash, till they saw at the head of the tide Alextown (Gweek), nestling in a glen which sloped towards the southern sun ;\" and how Hereward there succoured a Princess of Cornwall by slaying the Pictish giant Ironhook. Helford is quiet and safe enough now, but not so very many years ago it was little better than a nest of smugglers and wreckers, not much more peaceably inclined than the old Celtic King of Gweek. Leaving Helford (and if it were an east wind we should, as I have done before, find a heavy and steep sea at the entrance), we give Nare point a berth of a quarter of a mile, and then direct our bow S. by E. \u00a3 E., to clear the Manacles bell buoy, distant about two and a half miles. The Manacles are a cluster of dangerous rocks (some of which shew), extending from the shore to a distance of nearly a mile. Being directly in the course of ships making for Falmouth from the south, they have a gruesome history, but since the warning bell has been placed there, accidents have been comparatively rare. After passing the buoy, our course is S.W. by W. \\ W., close to the frowning precipice of Black Head, and keeping well to seaward of the line joining it and Beast point, as there are several sunken rocks in the bay between the two."], [149, ".OUR SILVER STREAK. 127 Off Beast point is a beaconed rock called the Vrogue, which must be passed to seaward, and now we see the Lizard light houses, surmounting the most southern point of England. We must not, however, investigate the Lizard too closely, for one of the most dangerous reefs on the coast, called the Stag rocks, extends from the cape for over half a mile. The outer rocks cover at about half to three-quarter flood. When they are not visible, the Vrogue beacon, on with the houses on Black head, leads east of them. We now round the point, and open the shores of Mounts Bay, the last great indentation on the south coast. With a north-east wind, a yacht might be safely luffed into Kynance Cove, and a landing effected, as it is free from hidden dangers ; but with any south in the wind this is impossible, owing to the heavy swell. For yachting purposes, Mounts Bay only possesses one harbour, viz., Penzance. No doubt Newlyn is available at neaps, but it is crowded with fishing craft, and, if the wind be westerly, it is far better to anchor outside in the roadstead called Guavas Lake. The harbours of Mousehole, St. Michael's Mount, and Porthleven, all dry out, and are quite unsuited for yachts. Penzance main harbour dries completely, but it is now furnished with an inner floating dock, where yachts can lie afloat at all times. The direct course from off the Stags to Penzance harbour is N.W. by N. \\ N., and the distance sixteen miles, and if the sea be slight this will lead clear of all shoals dangerous to yachts. If however, as not unfrequently happens, a heavy westerly swell is found rolling into the bay, there are several rocks in or very near to the above course, which although covered to the extent of upwards of eighteen feet, cause heavy breakers, which would be dangerous to a small vessel. The rocks referred to are (1) the Boa, (2) Great Row, (3) Iron Gates, and (4) Mountamopus. The Boa is a rock with six fathoms over it, situated about two miles from the shore of the N.W. extremity of Kynance Cove. Great Row, with three fathoms, and Iron Gates with four, are much further up the bay (about seven miles N.N.W. of the Boa, and about one and a half, miles from Mountamopus buoy). To clear all these dangers, after passing the Stags, we must steer N.W. \u00a3 W.,"], [150, "128 FALMOUTH TO PENZANCE. until Penzance harbour bears N.N.W. \u00a3 W., when a direct course may be made for it. In beating up the bay, the coast on both sides may be approached to within half a mile ; but if there is any swell, we must avoid the rocks above referred to, and also the Welloe, three-quarters of a mile from Trewavas Head, which dries five feet. For this purpose, do not bring Penzance lighthouse W. of N.N.W. \\ W., and you will clear all the eastern shoals, and do not bring it E. of N. by E., by which means you will clear all those on the west side of the bay. At night, the space within these limits is illuminated by a red light when there is two and a half fathoms and over at Penzance entrance, and by a green one when there is less than that. Outside these limits, the light shews white. If the weather be thick, the safest course is to stand right across for the western side of the bay, when, by keeping three-quarters of a mile off the shore, all dangers will be avoided. As we approach Penzance, we leave the black Mount- amopus buoy to starboard, and Clements Island and the black and white Low Lee buoy to port. About a quarter of a mile north of the latter is a rock called Cam Base, with only four feet on it ; but it is inshore of the line joining the buoy and Penzance lighthouse. About a mile beyond Low Lee, we pass the Gear rock with its high iron beacon, (leaving it to port); and as it is near low water, we must bring up a little to the N.N.E. of this rock, in four fathoms, to wait for the tide, and we shall do wisely to utilize the interval by interviewing the harbour master, and finding out when we can enter the basin, and where we can lie when within its shelter. The north side of the bay between Penzance and St. Michael's Mount is very rocky, and the lighthouse should never be brought to bear W. of W. by N. f N. ; but with this caution one may sail across to Mount St. Michael, and drop anchor in the roadstead on its N.W. side in four fathoms, only taking care to avoid the nine foot rock called the Guthen, which lies about three hundred yards W. by N. \\ N. of the castle. Penzance itself is a mean looking town, but the noble bay, with the castellated Mount St. Michael on the left, and the Lizard in the distance, form a scene of great beauty enhanced"], [151, "OUR SILVER STREAK. I2Q. by the brilliant colours of the sea, which breaks on the white sandy beach in green of the purest emerald tint. While here, it is desirable to make excursions by land to St. Michael's Mount, and to the Lands End ; and persons of artistic sympathies will not fail to visit Newlyn, the chosen home of the new and admirable Cornish school of painters. It is also an easy journey by rail from Penzance to St. Ives, on the north coast, where, on a fine day, the colouring is simply magnifi cent, and where a stay may well be made at the comfortable Tregenna Castle Hotel, a place unique in itself, and combining many of the amenities of a country house. Steamers start thrice a week from Penzance to Scilly, and although they are small and inconvenient vessels, many yacht owners prefer to visit the islands by their means, rather than risk their own boats in that perilous neighbourhood. Penzance is an ancient town, and, together with Newlyn, was burnt by the Spaniards in 1595. The name, according to Norden, \" signifieth Caput Sabuli, the head of the sande, and so it standeth in the botome of Mountes baye adjoining unto the sande.\" St. Michael's Mount, although very inferior to its Norman namesake, is an interesting place. Carew, in that curious doggrel in which he so much delighted, says of it : \u2014 Who knows not Mighel's Mount and Chaire, The Pilgrim's holy vaunt ; Both lande and Island twice a day Both fort and port of haunte. Norden describes it in his quaint way as, \" a steep and moste craggie torr, called in the Saxon tongue Melchelstor, Michael's hill or mounte. Tor signifieth a sharp mounte, or hille, turri similis. It is at the full sea insula plena, at low water peninsula.\" This old writer then gives a pictorial representation of the Mount in his day (which differs but slightly from its present appearance, even to the harbour at its base) and proceeds : \u2014 \" The buyldings that are on the topp of this mounte are auntient, all of freestone, verie stronge and permanent, wherof muche was erected by William Moreton, nephew to William the Conquerour. It was sometimes a cell of Munckes, but since foitefyde for defence.\" 1"], [152, "PLYMOUTH TO FALMOUTH. 130 The Mount is about a mile in circumference, and two hundred and thirty feet high. Visitors are admitted into the buildings in the absence of the St. Aubyn family, to whom it belongs. The hall is comparatively modern (1660), but the towers date back to, at all events, the fifteenth century. On its platform is the so-called St. Michael's chair, of which it is said, that whoever of man or wife first sits in it, will bear sway over the other. It is however a dangerous seat, and I do not advise anyone to try it. On the shore opposite the Mount lies the little town of Marazion. How it got this name I know not, as in the time of Carew it was called Marhas Dion, which according to him was the Cornish for Thursdays market. It is but a small place, but like so many others along our south coast (a fact which after so many years of peace we scarcely sufficiently realise) it has suffered in bygone wars. As Carew puts it : \u2014 ' At the beginning of K.H. VIII. raigne it felt the French men's fiery indigation, who landed there with thirty sayle.

PENZANCE TO SCILLY. \" I saw thee on a summer's day Among the many isles asleep ; A few faint fleecy cloudlets lay In shadow on thine azure deep ; And as they drifted past, I knew How bright and boundless was the blue. E. G. A. Holmes. IT is not desirable to attempt the passage to the Scilly Islands without a leading wind, for, with any west in it, there is certain to be a heavy swell, if not a heavy sea, and this will take the wind out of the sails of any small craft. We will, therefore, wait at Penzance until a breeze comes with some east in it. The wished-for breeze having at length arrived, let us tow out of the dock, and sail down the bay, keeping about a mile from the western shore until the Runnel Stone bell buoy is left on our starboard hand. In westerly and southerly winds there is often a huge ocean swell off the Runnel Stone. Indeed, from personal experience, I should put it down at something like twenty feet from the base to the crest of the waves. This may sound somewhat incredible, but I can vouch for it that the rollers look that height, and I am confirmed in the belief that this is not an unconscious exaggeration of the mind, by the fact that, on the Boa rock, the sea often breaks furiously in six fathoms, which it would surely not do unless the swell were over twenty feet. Taking our departure from the Runnel Stone buoy, we can shape a course for one of two harbours, viz., either (i) for St. Mary's road, or (2) for New Grimsey. St. Mary's road, distant twenty-five miles from the Runnel Stone, has the advantage or disadvantage of a town (Hugh Town) on its shores, whereas New Grimsey is wild and desolate in the extreme, with nothing to disturb one save only \" The surgy murmurs of the lonely sea.\"* New Grimsey is, however, * Keats."], [155, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 133 very decidedly the better harbour of the two, being situated between the Islands of Tresco and Bryer, and only exposed to the north ; whereas St. Mary's road is exposed to the full force of the Atlantic in S.W. winds, which, as we know, are the most prevalent. Still as the wind is N.E. and the glass high, we will take the opportunity of investigating St. Mary's, resolving that directly the barometer shews signs of falling, or the wind moves to the southward, we will \" up-stick \" and get into the securer haven between Bryer and Tresco. To carry out this intention, we steer W. J N., whereas, had we been bound to New Grimsey, our course would have been W. by N. -|r N. As we leave the buoy astern, the Lands End comes into sight to starboard, with the Longships rocks and lighthouse; and a little further on the Wolf lighthouse, perched on a desolate rock seven miles out at sea, is passed on our left. Before these beacons were erected, many a good ship met its fate just as it entered in sight of home, and many a gallant life was lost. Indeed, in bygone times, the area beginning with Scilly and ending with the Lizard was perhaps as deadly a bit of coast as was to be found all round England. Now, how ever, these lights, together with those on the Bishop's rock to the westward of Scilly, on St. Agnes and Round Islands, and off the Seven Stones, render the navigation, in clear weather, a comparatively simple matter. As we proceed, we see the Islands, at first dim and low, like a blue-grey cloud on the horizon, but gradually taking shape, until they disclose themselves as a bewildering archipelago of islands, islets, and rocks of all sizes and shapes, from St. Mary's, which is some nine miles in circumference, to rocks which merely lift their sharp and vicious-looking heads above the surface of the sea. It will be understood, therefore, that our navigating abilities are now about to be put to the test. As we approach the entrance of St. Mary's Sound, a black and white vertically striped buoy is sighted about mid-channel. This marks the north-east extremity of the \" Spanish ledge,\" a reef which runs off from the north side of St. Agnes. It is therefore necessary to leave this buoy to the southward, but the"], [156, "134 PENZANCE TO SCILLY. channel between it and Peninnis Head on St. Mary's is free from danger. After passing Spanish ledge buoy, the St. Agnes shore may be approached to within a cable's length. The St. Mary's shore, on the contrary, becomes dangerous after passing Peninnis Head, and the line joining the Head and the Wool pack beacon (marking a ledge which runs out from the south west corner of St. Mary's) should not be crossed. After passing the beacon, give the shore a berth of half a cable (one hundred yards), and keep inside (i.e., to the northward) of the black and white striped buoy on the Bartholomew ledge, as it is moored to the northward of the rocks, and there is seven fathoms between it and the land. We now steer for a remarkable detached rock called Stevel rock, which is bold-to, and, when abreast of it, make a N. by E course until St. Martin's red and white day-mark comes open of St. Mary's, so as to miss Woodcock's ledge, with nine feet on it at L.W.S. This ledge will be passed when Star Castle, on St. Mary's, bears S.S.E. We may then steer towards the north point of St. Mary's, at the same time making a signal for a pilot, as St. Mary's pool or harbour is very confined in area, and strewed with rocks, and it would be simple folly to risk our vessel in such a tight place, when the benefit of local knowledge can be had without difficulty. The Scilly Isles are a group of islands about forty in number, but as each island has numerous rocky satellites, too minute to rank as islands, the total number of isolated rocks, islands, and islets probably reaches several hundred. They are wholly composed of granite, outliers of the granite high lands of Cornwall, and contain a total area of 3,560 acres, with a population of between two and three thousand souls. The principal, and indeed the only town, is Hugh Town, off which we are now anchored. It occupies a sandy peninsula, crowned by the height called the Garrison, on which stands Star Castle, erected in the time of Henry VIII. or Elizabeth. On account of the equable nature of the climate, the vegetation is luxuriant, although, curiously enough, no timber is to be found anywhere. Fuchsias, aloes, geraniums, myrtles, cacti, and prickly pear grow freely in the open air, and the"], [157, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 135 early Scillonian potatoes and asparagus have now become famous throughout England. As Mr. Besant says in his charming story \" Armorel of Lyonesse\" (which all visitors to Scilly should read):\u2014 \"The sun of Scilly is never too fierce or too burning in summer, nor in winter does it ever lose its force ; in July, when people of the adjacent islands of Great Britain and Ireland venture not forth into the glare of the sun, here the soft sea mists and the strong sea air temper the heat ; and in December the sun still shines with a lingering warmth, as if he loved the place.\" The only inhabited islands are St. Mary's, Tresco (the seat of Col. Dorien Smith, the Lord or Vice-Duke of Scilly), St. Martin's, St. Agnes', and Bryer. In Mr. Besant's book, Sampson also is treated as inhabited, but it has, I believe, ceased to be so for many years past. The gardens of Tresco Abbey are renowned for their beauty, and comprise tropical plants and shrubs of all kinds, from the flowering aloe to the camphor tree. They are open, by the courtesy of the proprietor, to all tourists. The other islands, especially Bryer and Sampson, are also well worth visiting ; but it is desirable to engage the services of a local waterman of experience, as there are rocks every where. An excellent guide will be found in Mr. R. Collett of St. Mary's, who is thoroughly experienced in Scillonian* navigation. The dangers of the adjacent waters are eloquently and forcibly expressed in \" Armorel of Lyonesse \" in the following words: \u2014 \"The swell of ocean is always rolling among the rocks and round the crags and headlands of the isles. Only in calm weather, and in broad daylight, can the boatman who knows the place venture in these waters. Not even the most skilled boatman would steer for the outer islands at sunset. For there are hidden rocks, long ridges of teeth that run out from the islands, to tear and grind to powder any boat that should be caught in their devouring jaws. There are currents also which run swiftly and unexpectedly between the islands, to sweep the boat along with them till it shall strike the rocks, * The use of the word Scilly in an adjectival sense is resented by the islanders. \" Scillonian \" is de rigeur."], [158, "136 PENZANCE TO SCILLY. and so go down with any who are aboard ; and there are strong gusts which sweep round the headlands and blow through the narrow sounds.\" An excellent view of the entire archipelago is to be obtained from the summit of Sampson. This view is described by Mr. Besant in the following words : \u2014 \" At their feet the waves broke in white foam (in the calmest weather the Atlantic surge rolling over the rocks is broken into foam), a broad sound or channel lay between Samson and the adjacent island ; in the channel half a dozen rocks and islets showed black and threatening. ' The island across the channel,' said Armorel, ' is Bryher. This is Bryher Hill, because it faces Bryer Island. Yonder on Bryher is Samson Hill, because it faces Samson Island. Bryer is a large place. There are houses and farms on Bryer, and a church, where they have service every Sunday afternoon.' . . She turned and looked to the north-east, where lie the eastern islands, the group between St. Martin's and St. Mary's, a miniature in little of the greater groups. From this point they looked to the eye of ignorance like one island. Armorel distinguished them. There were Great and Little Arthur ; Ganilly, with his two hills, like Samson ; the Ganninicks and Meneweather, Ragged Island, and Inis Vouls. ' They are not inhabited,' said the girl, point ing to them one by one ; ' but it is pleasant to row about among them in fine weather. In the old time when they made kelp, people would go and live there for weeks together. But they are not cultivated.' Then she turned northwards, and shewed them the long island of St. Martin's, with its white houses, its church, its gentle hills, and its white and red day mark on the highest point. Half of St. Martin's was hidden by Tresco, and more than half of Tresco by Bryher. Over the downs of Tresco rose the domes of Round Island, crowned with its white lighthouse. And over Bryer, out at sea, shewed the rent and jagged crest of the great rock Menovawr. ' You should land on Tresco ' said Armorel. ' There is the church to see. Oh ! it is a most beautiful church. They say that in Cornwall itself, there is hardly any church so fine as Tresco church. And then there are the gardens and the lake.* * Ostriches are or were to be seen roaming about the shores of this lake,"], [159, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 137 Everybody goes to see the gardens, but they do not walk over the down to Cromwell's Castle. Yet there is nothing in the islands like Cromwell's Castle, standing on the sand, with Shipman's Head beyond. And you must go out beyond Tresco to the islands which we cannot see here, Tean and St. Helen's, and the rest.' Then she turned westward. Lying scattered among the bright waters, whitened by the breeze, there lay before their eyes \u2014 dots and specks upon the biggest maps, but here great massive rocks and rugged islets piled with granite, surrounded by ledges and reefs, cut and carved by winds and flying foam into ragged edges, bold peaks and defiant cliffs \u2014 places where all the year round the seals play, and the sea gulls scream, and, in spring, the puffins lay their eggs, with the oyster-catchers and the sherewaters, the shags and the hern. . . . ' Look ! that great rock with the ledge at foot, is Castle Bryer ; that noble rock beyond is Maiden Bower; the rock farthest out is Scilly . . They stood upon the summit of the northern hill and looked upon the southern islands. ' Here you can see the south islands. Look ! there is Minalto, which you drifted past yesterday ; there are the ledges of White Island, where you were nearly cast away and lost ; there is Annet, where the sea-birds lay their eggs \u2014 oh ! thousands and thousands of puffins, though now there are not any ; you should see them in the spring. That is St. Agnes \u2014 a beautiful island. I should like to show you Camberdiyl and St. Warna's Cove. And there are the dogs of Scilly beyond \u2014 they look to be black spots from here. You should see them close, then you would understand how big they are and how terrible. There are Gorregan and Daisy, Rosevean and Rosevear, Crebawethan and Pednathias ; and there \u2014 where you see a little circle of white\u2014 that is Retarrier Ledge. Not long ago there was a great ship coming slowly up the channel in bad weather ; she was filled with Germans from New York, going home to spend the money they had saved in America ; most of them had their money with them tied up in bags. Suddenly the ship struck on Retarrier. It was ten o'clock in the evening, and a great sea running.

There, on the right of Retarrier, is the Bishop's rock and lighthouse. In storms, the lighthouse rocks like a tree in the wind. You ought to sail over to those rocks, if it was only to see the surf dashing up their sides.\" The wreck of the \" Schiller,\" in 1875 (which is that referred to by Mr. Besant) is only one of numerous sea tragedies of which Scilly has been the scene, as a visit to the churchyard of Old Town will prove. Perhaps one of the most fatal of these disasters was that which took place on the 22nd of October, 1707, when four men-of-war, under the command of Sir Cloudesley Shovel, went ashore in a fog on the western rocks, and the admiral, together with 2,000 men, perished. The history of Scilly is obscure, but there seems to be little doubt that the islands were known to the Ph\u0153nicians under the name of the Cassiterides, or tin islands. This, however, is not the popular and poetical view, which is that, formerly, these islands formed part of the mainland. The intervening land betwern Salz and the Lands End, was according to this legend, washed away in comparatively recent times. The submerged district was, they say, galled Lyonesse, and the kings of Lyonesse were buried on Sampson. In support of this, there are undoubtedly numerous \" barrows \" or sepulchral mounds on Sampson, which are supposed by many antiquaries to be peculiar to royal persons. However geologists, who are a prosaic race, will have none of the theory, pointing out that the poundings between the Lands End and Scilly, are between thirty and forty fathoms, and that for the sea to wash away so enormous a mass of solid granite, in so comparatively short a period, is absolutely incredible. The Romans appear to have used the islands as a place of banishment for state criminals, and it is said that some of the sepulchral remains are of un doubtedly Roman origin, although most of them (the barrows and kist-vaens, i.e., stone coffins or chests on Sampson) are Celtic. Athelstan subdued the isles in the tenth century, and, after that, they seem to have been in the happy position of having no history, until the Parliamentary wars, when Sir John Grenville held them for Charles, and made them such a terror"], [161, "OUR SILVER STREAK. 139 to the shipping coming up or down Channel, that Blake was sent to attack him. This he did from Tresco and Bryer, building Cromwell's Castle on the latter. After a tough struggle, Blake proved the stronger, and the islands were surrendered. For many years the islands were the property of the Godolphin family, but fell in to the Crown in the reign of William IV., as part of the Duchy of Cornwall. Shortly after wards they were leased to Mr. Augustus Smith, the predecessor of the present lord proprietor, Col. Dorien Smith, and under his beneficent despotism they have flourished exceedingly, and a more prosperous, intelligent and well-educated little com munity, it would be difficult to find anywhere. One of the disadvantages of Scilly as a cruising head quarters is the difficulty of getting stores. Although the land of early fruit, none is ever to be bought there, and even meat is only to be got twice a week at Hugh Town, whither it is imported from the mainland, and even then there is consider able difficulty in getting a good joint. Coke, too, is not to be had, so far as I know, on the islands, and this, in the case of a small yacht, causes very great inconvenience. All these drawbacks to anchoring for any length of time at Hugh Town are of course intensified at New Grimsey, where there is no town at all, although eggs and butter and milk can be obtained at the farms on Bryer. Anyone therefore who proposes to make a stay at the islands, should enter into arrangements with some tradesman at Penzance, to forward coke and meat, and should also take out a good supply of tea and coffee and stores which will keep. In the event of anchoring at New Grimsey, it would be well to have the stores consigned to Mr. Collett, or some other pilot, with whom an arrangement could be made to bring them over the flats from St. Mary's. New Grimsey Sound is a really first-rate little harbour, although small and narrow. The stranger must only attempt to enter it from the north, but the local pilots will, at high water, safely conduct a yacht from Hugh Town Harbour across the Tresco flats, and through the southern entrance of the Sound. At low water spring tides, this southern entrance"], [162, "PENZANCE TO SCILLY. 140 completely dries, and, as it is strewed with rocks, no one should, even at high water, attempt it without local assistance. Entering from the northward, there are two rocks on the eastern side of the entrance, called Kettle and Kettle Bottom, just off Tresco. These always shew above water, and there fore are not really dangerous. Keep outside them, and make towards Shipman Head on the opposite shore, which is steep to. On the Tresco shore there are several rocks ; but, when Cromwell's Castle, built on a high and jutting promontory on Tresco, is passed, that shore also is bold. Beyond the castle, in the middle of the Sound, is a pyramidal islet called Hangman's Island, a pile of rocks seventy or eighty feet high. There is a fathom of water at L.W.S. beyond and to the southward of this islet, and a small yacht may, at all events at neap tides, bring up there in a very snug berth in N.W. winds. If, however, the wind be southerly, it is better to anchor to the N.W. of Hangman's Island, in four and a half fathoms. NOTES ON PILOTAGE. si.) Magnetic Courses and Distances.

The N. stream commences about half an hour after low water at Penzance, and the S. stream about half an hour after high water there. At the Scillies, the streams are very puzzling ; but, in St. Mary's Sound, the S.E. or flood stream commences at 4 hours before high water at Penzance (or St. Mary's), and the ebb or N.W. stream at 2 hours after high water. In New Grimsey the stream is most eccentric. It begins to run in from the north at low water at St. Mary's. After i\\ hours, the flats being covered, the stream turns and runs from the south for 3 hours. It then turns, and sets from the north for 4$ hours (or until half ebb at St. Mary's) ; after which it again flows towards the north for the remaining 3 hours.
