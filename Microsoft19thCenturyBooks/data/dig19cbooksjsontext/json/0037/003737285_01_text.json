A TALE OF '37 PROLOGUE ' In this very room I once took part in a game of cards for the most tremendous stake that any man ever won or lost.' The words were spoken quietly, without any attempt to produce a sensation. I looked up at my companion with a questioning air. ' He was an old man over eighty, yet hale and strong. There was no dimness in his eyes, no quavering in his voice. He sat upright in his chair, with something of a military stiff ness, and did not seem to be incommoded by the high old fashioned collar which embraced his jaws. He glanced round the room after he had spoken, and his eye rested on a corner near the fireplace. ' Yes, that is where the table stood,' he remarked. ' In those days this was the card-room. Dear me, how things have changed since then ! Even Buckles' is not the same as it used to be in my young days.' I glanced round the room in my turn. The dark, heavy furniture, only lighted by the wax candles which stood in branches round the walls, the solemn old engravings, the head waiter, himself a patriarch, standing like an attentive sphinx beside the massive buffet, with an eye fixed on my venerable host, all seemed like a scene out of a bygone age. It was B"], [12, "' GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ! ' 2 difficult to believe that bicycles might be passing up and down outside in St. James's Street, it was impossible to admit the existence of motor cars. ' Ah, what a different place this was sixty years ago ! ' the General added, shaking his head gravely. ' There were strange doings in this room then. The play was not like it is in the clubs of to-day. There were stories still told of the desperate gambling of men like Fox and Sheridan \u2014 great men, sir, in spite of their faults. The four-bottle men were gone before my time, but we had some of the three-bottle men left still. Why, I have seen Tom Moore \u2014 you have heard of Tom Moore, the poet ? ' I nodded my head. But the old man checked himself, as though he felt a twinge of self-reproach. No doubt he reminded himself that such reminiscences were not for the ear of a young man barely thirty. The anecdote about Tom Moore remained untold. Maxima revcrentia pueris. We were dining together in Buckles'. Every one knows that Buckles' is the oldest and most respectable club in London, and therefore in the universe, a place where such new-fangled inventions as gas have not yet been heard of; where the Times is considered a daring young journal of Americanising tendencies, and the memory of that late detestable turncoat and radical, Sir Robert Peel, is held in just odium. A bottle of port stood on the table between us, grimy as if with the subterranean dust of centuries. Port and Madeira are the only wines drunk in Buckles'. There is a tradition in the club that a committee was appointed about the middle of the century to report on the advisability of admitting claret into the club cellar ; but the members of the committee being divided in opinion, the innovation has not yet been decided on. The General drew out a heavy silver-gilt snuff-box, and tapped on the lid before opening it, to dislodge any clinging particles of snuff. ' This box was presented to me by a great man,' he said with reverence. ' I was fortunate enough to attract his favour-"], [13, "PROLOGUE 3 able notice when I was a mere lad \u2014 in connection with the very circumstances I have just referred to.' He opened the box, and courteously offered its contents to me. With a dreamy, pleasant sensation of being transported back into the past in a hypnotic trance, I helped myself to a pinch. My aged friend followed my example, and then handed me the box itself. I took it respectfully into my hands, and examined the inscription on the lid. It was in fine Italian letters which had become almost illegible with time and use. I read it out \u2014 ' Presented to Captain on the occasion of his marriage, by his obliged friend, Wellington \u2014 July 28, 1838.' ' The great Duke ! ' I observed inquiringly. ' The great Duke \u2014 yes.' ' And on the date of the Queen's coronation ? ' * The same day.' I returned the precious relic to its owner. ' The Duke sent it to me on the morning of that day, with a letter in his own hand, in which he was good enough to say that my humble services had contributed to bring about that glorious event.' He gazed wistfully at the inscription for a few moments before restoring the box to his pocket. He must have known every line and flourish by heart. Then he looked up and caught my wondering expression. ' I see you are surprised. It must sound strange to a young man like you, born and brought up in the shadow, as it were, of Victoria's name, to hear me talk like this. Ah, well, she has been a good Queen for England, a good Queen. I am getting old, and I don't understand all these new ideas. Tories or Liberals, they all seem much the same now-a-days, and it's a race between them which shall bring the country to the dogs first. But as long as our good Queen is on the throne, I don't give up hope. No, my boy, I don't give it up ; and as long as I am alive she will still have one loyal subject left. She knows that, God bless her.' It was no news to me that my old friend enjoyed the savour of his Sovereign. Only the other day I had seen his name in B 2"], [14, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 4 the papers among the guests at a dinner-party at Windsor. Moreover I was aware that he had formerly served as one of her Majesty's aides-de-camp, and that his wife had been one of those famous Bedchamber Women, the Queen's refusal to dismiss whom, at the bidding of Sir Robert Peel, had led to the fall of that Minister in the year 1841. In addition to his G.C.B. he had been invested at one time or another with nearly every one of the Orders created during the present reign for the decoration of the Sovereign's personal friends and servants, and her Majesty had stood godmother to his eldest son. This knowledge tended to confirm me in the belief that there was some real history underlying the strange hints the veteran had let fall. * You speak as if you had been concerned in some transac tion connected with the beginning of the Queen's reign,' I said, feeling my way gently, \u2014 ' some transaction which I have never heard of.' He nodded once or twice softly. ' I know of no event of so much consequence in history which has been so little heard of. What little was ever known about it seems to have passed completely from the public mind and been forgotten. But so much the better, perhaps, so much the better. Now that our young Queen, as we used to call her, has given her name to an era, and is about to celebrate the completion of the longest reign in the annals of Britain, why should men trouble themselves to recall the secret plots and perils that surrounded her accession sixty years ago ? ' These words roused my curiosity to the highest pitch. ' Yet for that very reason,' I urged, ' that this affair no longer possesses any living importance, and that most of the actors in it must by this time have passed away, it seems to me that the time has come when the story of it may be freely told.' The General was about to say something in answer, when he observed the head- waiter bearing down upon us. The head-waiter at Buckles' is not a common man. The head-waiter at Buckles' is an autocrat. He rules the club with an iron sway under which newly admitted members are apt to"], [15, "PROLOGUE 5 writhe, but to which the older ones submit with evident com plaisance. No election to the club ever takes place without his being consulted, and by his decision the candidate stands or falls. I have reason to know and dread the power of this majestic being. It is my misfortune to be a person who is disapproved of by the head-waiter of Buckles'. I know not whether it is my extreme youth that is against me, or my lack of noble birth. Influence has failed to soften this rigid Cer berus, and bribes might as well be offered to a tombstone. As long as the head-waiter lives I have no hope of becoming a member of Buckles'. In accepting the hospitality of my distinguished friend I had no doubt been guilty of an act of presumption. During the dinner the head-waiter had made me feel that my presence was an intrusion. He had poured out my wine under respect ful protest, and had ordered one of his myrmidons to change my plate, with deep misgiving. He now seized the first opportunity of putting an end to a painful situation. He fixed my venerable host with a reproach ful eye, and asked in guarded tones \u2014 ' Do you require anythink more, Sir Edward ? ' We took the hint, and rose from the table. But I was not going to lose my story. I followed my companion from the room still intent upon it. I stooped to unworthy arts. I delicately flattered him on his possession of a secret. I ques tioned him with the ingenuity of a trained solicitor. And finally I extorted a full disclosure. The narrative which I thus obtained proved to be more dramatic and more surprising than I could have possibly anticipated. When we parted at a rather late hour, I went home determined to master the subject. I searched for every thing that could throw light on an extraordinary passage in our history which has escaped the attention of professed writers of fiction, and has received the vaguest notice from historians. The result of my investigations is contained in the following pages. I do not offer this book as history. Let it be read as a story, nothing more. I shall be satisfied if it prove not less"], [16, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 6 interesting than so-called historical romances, the scene of which is laid in distant ages and in foreign lands. It is for the very few personages now living who are in a position to judge of its accuracy to say whether I have in any way overstepped the bounds of historical truth."], [17, "7 CHAPTER I THE DUKE OF CUMBERLAND'S SUPPER PARTY On a certain night in the month of June, in the year 1837, his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland was giving a recep tion in Saint James's Palace to the officers of the Guards. Saint James's has changed little in the last sixty years. It is still one of those old-world nooks in which the wanderer seems to hear the rustle of the vanishing centuries. No other palace in the world is like Saint James's ; a quaint conglomeration of ill-matched buildings, Jacobean gateways and chapels and rooms of State, side by side with Georgian houses ; queer little courts and narrow passages, with names which testify to their departed glories; Ambassadors' Courts no longer haunted by ambassadors, and Stable Courts in which the royal steeds no longer champ their corn. Sixty years ago Saint James's had already ceased to be the home 0/ the Sovereign, but royal levees were held there then, as novjf, and royal princes housed within its venerable walls. On the night of the Duke of Cumberland's party the ancient gile presented a busy scene. Ever since the fall of dusk that quarter which adjoined the rooms of State had been brilliantly lighted up. Punctually as the clock above the gate- way which faces up Saint James's Street struck ten, a guard of honour, consisting of a detachment of Foot Guards under the command of a lieutenant, came marching round the corner from the Park, turned into the courtyard, and drew up in two lines between the outer entrance and the building in which the lights shone. The lieutenant himself, a young gentleman of twenty years of age, did not retire into the guardroom of the Palace when he had posted his men, but lingered in the yard."], [18, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 8 where he paced up and down, pulling out his watch from time to time, and casting impatient glances through the open gateway. Tall, and carrying himself with an air of soldierly alertness, the young officer seemed an attractive specimen of that famous class of dandies who still preserved the traditions of Beau Brummell. His features were well cut, and his blue eyes and fair complexion were what foreigners had come to regard as those of the typical Englishman. His hair, of a reddish brown, curled thickly close to his head, and each cheek showed a budding whisker, while the lips and chin were shaven clean. His full-dress uniform betrayed the care of the exquisite, of a time when to be something of an exquisite was the hall-mark of breeding, and when England still recalled with pride that on the dreadful glorious field of Waterloo there had been no greater courage than that among the scented fops of her Guards. The expectant mood of the young officer was shared by a numerous crowd who had gathered outside the gateway to see the guests arrive. This crowd, drawn chiefly from the lowest class of the people, passed the time of waiting in exchanging rough jests, in which the name of the Duke of Cumberland was treated with scant respect. Ernest, Duke of Cumberland, and eldest surviving brother of the King, William IV., was the most unpopular man in England. His career had been a dark and stormy one. The mysterious murder of his valet, Sellis, had left a cloud on the Duke's name which had never been dispelled. Rumour attributed to him every evil quality, and denied to him any of the merits of his family\u2014 the domestic virtues of his father, the pleasant manners of the Regent, or the bluff good-nature of William IV. Add to this that the Duke was a violent partisan, and had identified himself with those irreconcilable Tories who resisted Reform to the bitter end, and had never forgiven the Duke of Wellington for accepting Catholic Emancipation, and the feeling of the mob towards him may, perhaps, be under stood. Soon the throng were rewarded for their wait, as coach after coach came rolling down Saint James's Street, and rumbled"], [19, "DUKE OF CUMBERLAND'S SUPPER PARTY 9 through the heavy archway, each with its load of guests. Peering eagerly through the windows of the vehicles as they passed, the onlookers feasted their eyes on the brilliant costumes of those within, the dazzling uniforms of the Household regiments, the breasts of the veterans thickly sown with Peninsular and Waterloo medals, the stars and ribbons worn by great nobles or celebrated statesmen, whose faces were quickly recognised, the magnificent Court robes of stately dames and demoiselles, the diamond tiaras, and the ostrich plumes that brushed the very roofs of the carriages. Many of the celebrities, as they went by, were made the subject of remarks, not always friendly. ' Look, there's the Duke of Buckingham ! A \u2014 ah ! ' ' And there's Lord Kenyon ! Another Tory ! ' ' That's Lord Hill ! Just look at his medals ! Hurrah ! ' * Three cheers for Hill ! ' The cheering was taken up with vigour as Wellington's favourite lieutenant, now holding the high post of Commander of the Forces, passed through the gateway. ' See the Markiss of Londonderry ! Give him a groan ! ' The groaning was taken up as readily as the cheering had been. Indeed, as time went on, the groans became almost continual, as the crowd recognised one unpopular character after another among the friends whom the Duke of Cumberland had gathered together. But no echo of the noisy demonstrations outside was allowed to disturb the serenity of the scene within. As each coach drew up before the door to discharge its burden, the young lieutenant, whose restless movements have already been described, stepped forward eagerly, and scrutinised the faces of those alighting, turning away again each time with a discontented air. At last a huge old-fashioned chariot bearing an earl's coronet on the panels lumbered into the courtyard. Instantly the lieutenant's face brightened, he darted to the door, and threw it open, before the footman had time to scramble down from the box. Two ladies emerged, to whom the young man offered his hand in turn, to assist them to alight. First came a majestic"], [20, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 10 matron, covered with lace and jewels, who accepted his aid with severe condescension. She was followed by a girl of seventeen or eighteen, a young beauty of that charming type which is preserved for us in some of the portraits of Lawrence, the features smooth and regular, the forehead rather high than broad, the mouth and chin small, and the cheeks rosy with the bloom of youth and health. Beneath her modestly cast-down lashes the hazel eyes gave an occasional rebellious flash, all the more piquant by contrast with the demure carriage which the manners of the age required from the debutante. She smiled brightly at the sight of the young soldier, and gave his hand a meaning pressure as she got out, which remained a secret between him and herself. The lieutenant addressed himself to the elder lady with an air of deep respect. ' Good evening, Countess. I am delighted that you have been able to come.' The Countess drew herself up, eyeing him with no very friendly look. 'What brings you here, Mr. Hervey?' she inquired in forbidding tones. ' I am the officer on duty to-night,' he answered with an assumption of candid friendliness. ' His Royal Highness has favoured me with an invitation in consequence, so that I hope I may have the privilege of seeing you again inside.' The words were addressed to the Countess, but the look which accompanied them was aimed straight at her daughter. 'That will be very nice, won't it, mamma?' the beauty ventured to answer. ' I have some great news to tell you, Mr. Hervey,' she added with a smile of triumph. Hervey bowed, overwhelmed with delight. The Countess frowned rebukingly. ' Come, Fanny, don't you see we are blocking up the way ? ' she said in a tone of command. The lieutenant hastened to offer his arm, as her ladyship made a step forward. ' Thank you, Mr. Hervey, I won't trouble you,' she said in chilling tones, sailing past him."], [21, "DUKE OF CUMBERLAND'S SUPPER PARTY n Nothing daunted, he promptly turned and offered his arm to Fanny, who at once took it, pretending not to see her mother's glare of disapproval. The next minute they were in the hall, where Hervey was obliged to resign them to the charge of the attendants. As they were being ushered upstairs into the Duke's presence the Countess took advantage of the opportunity to administer a maternal reproof. ' Understand me, child, once for all ; I forbid you to en courage the attentions of that boy. A younger son, with eight hundred a year beside his pay, and no prospect of ever suc ceeding \u2014 the idea of your marrying him is absolutely out of the question. You hear me, Fanny? His absurd pretensions will only compromise you with serious suitors.' The Countess paused a moment, and then added, ' Baron Sturmer is certain to be here to-night. Remember that you are to be civil to him ; I order it. I won't have you behaving to him as you did the other day.' ' But, mamma, Baron Sturmer is a foreigner, a German, and besides I cannot bear him.' ' That has nothing to do with it. Besides, you are quite wrong. The Hanoverians are not foreigners ; they are our fellow subjects. The Baron is a most distinguished man, immensely rich, and very high in the Duke of Cumberland's favour. If his Royal Highness becomes King of Hanover, as he may before the year is out, the Baron will probably be first Minister.' ' All that doesn't make him any nicer. I may be civil to him, but I wouldn't marry him if he were going to be King of Hanover himself.' ' You will marry whom I tell you to, if I have to lock you in your room on bread and water.' Before the girl could reply to this threat, which was no idle one in the mouth of the parent of two generations back, an attendant-shouted out, \u2014 \u25a0 ....\u2022.\u2022\u25a0 = ' The Countess Dowager of Maldon and the Lady Fanny Greville ! ' Emerging from the throng the two ladies found themselves"], [22, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 12 face to face with their royal host, and at once proceeded to execute those elaborate curtseys on which our grandmothers so prided themselves. The Duke of Cumberland, who at this period had reached the age of sixty-six, was standing under a chandelier in the centre of the principal saloon. A stern, dark man, with the face of one who had never denied himself a pleasure, nor shrunk from any action to which his interests prompted him, he lacked even that outward veneer of courtesy by which so many bad princes have managed to soften down their evil qualities. At the moment the two ladies were announced he was talking in German to a man of very marked characteristics, but as the ladies came up he broke off, and remarked loudly in English \u2014 ' Ha, Sturmer, here is a young lady you are interested in, I believe. Take her while you have the chance, but don't forget the supper.' Fanny rose from her curtsey, her checks burning at this brutal pleasantry. But the Baron advanced to her, and she was obliged to accept his proffered arm, though she did so with a shrinking which he could hardly pretend not to see. The Hanoverian, however, was not a man to let himself be baulked by trifles. ' Permit me,' he said, speaking with a strong German accent ; ' I will conduct you to a seat from which we can watch the company as they come in.' He led his victim to a corner opposite the door, and as soon as they were seated began to address her in the style of exaggerated compliment which young ladies were then supposed to demand from their admirers. ' You have come so late that I was almost in despair. Your absence would have spoilt the whole reception, which I per suaded the Duke to give in order that I might have the pleasure of meeting you again. I have great influence with his Royal Highness, and I ask nothing better than to be permitted to use that influence in your service.' Fanny listened restlessly, keeping her eyes fixed on the doorway, through which the guests were streaming in, and"], [23, "DUKE OF CUMBERLAND'S SUPPER PARTY 13 avoiding the face of her companion. It was a remarkable face enough, and one that might have served very well for a rough caricature of the Bismarck of another generation. Baron Sturmer was some twenty years younger than his master, though his hair was already iron-grey. His figure was burly, and his face too fleshy. The small deep- set eyes glittered beneath the deeply wrinkled forehead, with a malevolent expression, which the Baron's attempt to look amiable only succeeded in rendering furtive. An ugly scar across the bridge of the nose completed the sinister expression of the Duke of Cumberland's chosen friend. Fanny had endured the protestations of her formidable suitor for some time, when relief came. Sturmer suddenly rose from his seat, and muttering an excuse, crossed the room to greet a man whose name had just been announced. This was the Marquis of Londonderry, the nobleman who had provoked a hostile demonstration from the mob outside, and a well-known member of the group of Tory malcontents who had withdrawn from the leadership of Wellington and Peel in disgust at the passage of the Reform Bill. Scarcely had Sturmer disappeared, arm-in-arm with the Marquis, when Fanny caught sight of Hervey advancing through the door. A bright smile replaced the pout on her lips as the lieutenant singled her out with the unerring instinct of a lover, and made his way quickly to where she sat. Never theless, she glanced round with some nervousness, lest the Countess should be within view. ' My mother has forbidden me to speak to you,' she whis pered hurriedly, as the young man slipped into Sturmer's vacant seat. ' It will never do for her to see us together. Is there any place where we could go for a little while, out of sight ? ' Hervey thought for a minute, and then nodded his head. ' Come this way,' he said, rising and giving her his arm. ' We can get into a corridor leading to another part of the Palace, where no one is likely to find us.' He piloted her skilfully through the assemblage to the extreme end of the suite of reception rooms, where there was a door, hidden by a piece of tapestry. Raising the screen, they"], [24, "' GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ! ' 14 passed out, and found themselves in a wide, bare corridor dimly lighted by two candles stuck in a sconce against the wall. ' What a dreary place ! I am almost afraid,' murmured the girl. It was no doubt her fright which caused her to cling closer than usual to the arm of her companion. ' It's all right,' was the cheery answer ; ' I've explored all this part lots of times when I've been on guard. This passage leads to the Throne Room. It is used by the Royal Family at the levees.' He drew her down the corridor to the far end, where they turned a corner, and came into a small alcove, giving on a closed door. In this alcove there stood a wooden bench. ' We can sit down here,' said Hervey. ' That is the door into the Throne Room. It is kept locked when the room is not in use.' Fanny sat down, shivering slightly, and a few moments passed before either spoke. Then Hervey asked \u2014 ' Is it really true that your mother has forbidden you to speak to me ? ' \u25a0 Yes. And worse than that, she has ordered me to en- courage that detestable German, whom I can't bear. Oh, Teddy, I don't know what I shall do ! ' ' Fanny ! You don't mean Baron Sturmer ! ' ' Yes.' 'Monstrous ! That old man ! Why he must be nearly fifty ! ' ' I know. I would rather die than marry him. But what can I do ? My mother is determined on it. She says he is the Duke of Cumberland's favourite, and will be Prime Minister or something when the Duke becomes King.' ' King ? How do you mean ? ' ' King of Hanover. You know the Princess can't succeed there.' ' Yes, I know ; it's a shame. I wish them joy of the Duke of Cumberland, that's all.' ' But that reminds me, Teddy ; I have such a piece of news for you. Do you know what has happened ? '"], [25, "DUKE OF CUMBERLAND'S SUPPER PARTY 15 ' No ; what ? ' he demanded, surprised at her exultant tone. ' What do you think ! I am to be Lady-in-Waiting to the Princess ! ' ' The Princess ! ' The young man sat astonished, while Fanny enjoyed the effect she had produced. Presently she went on \u2014 * I was presented to her to-day for the first time. She was so kind and friendly, and yet as dignified as a queen. I would die for her, Teddy ! ' ' I hope she won't ask you to do that,' responded the young man, almost beginning to be jealous. ' And when do you begin ? ' ' At once. I go into residence at Kensington Palace from to-morrow. Won't it be delightful ? ' But if she expected her lover to share her enthusiasm she was disappointed. Teddy persisted in looking at the matter from a purely selfish standpoint. ' Does this mean that I shall see less of you than ever ? ' he murmured. 'Ah, I don't know yet. The Princess may not be very strict. We are sure to have some opportunities of meeting.' 'You don't seem to have thought much about it,' grumbled the young man. ' Are you going to let the Princess make you forget me ? ' ' For shame, Edward ; you have no right to speak like that ! Do you grudge me the honour of serving the Princess ? ' They seemed on the verge of as pretty a lovers' quarrel as need be, when suddenly the girl's quick ear caught the sound of footsteps coming along at the far end of the corridor. ' Hush ! ' Teddy listened. The stealthy footfalls echoed along the silent walls. ' Some one else must have found out the door behind the tapestry,' he breathed in her ear. ' It seems to be two men.' Fanny clutched his arm in despair. ' What can we do ? They must not find us here !"], [26, "16 'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN! ' They may turn back before they get as far as this. It is our only hope.' ' No, no, we mustn't risk that ! Try the door. It may not be locked.' Teddy took hold of the handle behind him, and softly turned it. To their infinite relief the door yielded to the first push. They slipped through on tiptoe, and closing the door, found themselves alone in the deserted Throne Room."], [27, "i7 CHAPTER II THE THRONE ROOM The Throne Room at midnight was a strange rendezvous fora pair of lovers, just come from the midst of a crowded reception. The shutters of the lofty windows were closely fastened, and not a ray of light penetrated the gloom of the vast empty chamber, given up to dust and silence. Guided rather by his former knowledge of the place than by the sense of sight, Hervey led his trembling companion across the bare polished floor to a low dais at the further end, on which stood the two solitary pieces of furniture the room contained, namely the Chairs of State, muffled in the wrappings which had not been removed since the seats had last been filled by the sailor King and beautiful Queen Adelaide. It was a happy instinct which had led the fugitives from the neighbourhood of the door. Hardly had they reached the dais when they heard the handle turn noisily, and a voice woke the echoes of the dark silent hall. ' Come in here, my lord, and we can speak without fear of being overheard.' As the accents reached her ears Fanny stifled a convulsive exclamation. It was the voice of Baron Sturmer. Pressing each other's hands as a pledge of mutual silence, the alarmed lovers crept behind the backs of the royal chairs, where they crouched down, afraid to breathe. Sturmer and his companion shut the door behind them in their turn, and advanced into the room till, from the sound of their voices, they were within twenty paces of the concealed pair. The Hanoverian appeared to be continuing a conversation c"], [28, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 18 urging some course of action on his companion, to which the other had not yet given his assent. ' We don't ask you to run the slightest risk,' he said, as they came to a standstill in the middle of the floor. ' We have got as many pledges of active help now as we need. All that we require at present is moral influence. We want to convince our men that there are others ready to join them as soon as they have made the first move.' ' But what do you want me to do, then ? ' Although these words were spoken in a low tone, only just above a whisper, the voice was recognised by both the in voluntary listeners. It was that of the man whose arrival had been so keenly welcomed by Sturmer, the Marquis of London derry. ' I will explain,' was the answer. ' As you know, we have sounded quite half of the officers in London, and most of them are favourable. But nearly every one of them has put the same question to us \u2014 \" What does the Duke say ? \" ' ' You mean, of course, the Duke of Wellington ? ' ' Of course. His name is everything with the army. Unless we can convince them that the Duke is secretly with us, it is my belief that many of them will hold back.' ' But Wellington cannot even be approached. If he were to hear anything it is quite possible that he might take action against us.' ' True, my lord. I agree that nothing must be told to him. But without doing that, it is quite possible to so manage as to give the officers the impression that his Grace is on our side. What we have to do is to arrange a function like this of to night, which, without committing anybody, can be passed off as a demonstration on behalf of the cause.' ' I see. You mean that your men should be invited to meet the Duke, under the belief that he is thereby showing his approval of their action ? ' . ' Your lordship takes me exactly.' ' Well, but who do you suggest should do this ? You know, Sturmer, I have broken with the Duke.' ' I understand that. He gave the regiment you had applied"], [29, "THE THRONE ROOM 19 for to Lord Hill. That is one of the things which his Royal Highness is most anxious to set right.' ' Tut, tut, that is a mere personal matter. I think the Duke used me badly, it is true. But my quarrel with him, I wish you to understand, has been on grounds of public principle.' The darkness concealed the expression that played over the German's face, as he replied smoothly \u2014 ' I quite understand your position, Marquis. However, to come to the point, it seems to me that the man to do our business is the Duke of Buckingham.' ' I doubt it. We have his sympathy perhaps, but he is selfish and timid, and won't take any open part. Besides, he has one foot in the Duke's camp. He expects to be Steward again if Peel comes in.' ' But that makes him all the more suitable for our purpose. We don't ask him to commit himself in any way. A mere social gathering at his house does not involve him in the least, while it leaves us free to put our own colour on it. I know you have sufficient influence with him to make him do this if you choose ; and you can hold out the hope of something better than a white staff if we succeed \u2014 the Privy Seal, for instance.' ' Well, I will see what can be done.' 'And as soon as possible, let me beg. We have had private advices from Windsor that the King is much worse than the public suppose. Anything may happen. He may even not ouriive the month.' ' That is very serious. Shall you, really be ready as soon as that ? ' ' I hope so, if all goes well. Remember that everything depends on getting in the first blow, and that I have all my plans thought out, while the others don't even suspect the existence of any danger.' Satisfied apparently with their consultation the two con spirators were preparing to depart when their ears were sud denly startled by an alarming noise, which rooted them to the spot. Tortured by the cramped position into which she had c 2"], [30, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 20 thrown herself, and unable to bear it any longer, Fanny had ventured to move just a minute too soon. In doing so, as luck would have it, she let a slender pearl bracelet slip from her wrist on to the floor. Bounding from the edge of the dais, the fatal trinket rolled several yards across the room, and then settled down with an alarming rattle on the boards. The sound struck on the silence of the great cavernous hall like the clash of cymbals. The plotters stood silent, peering through the shadows in fearful apprehension. * What was that ? ' the Marquis asked at length, in a faint whisper. The Hanoverian gripped him by the wrist with a warning squeeze, as he replied aloud in tones which he strove to render unconcerned \u2014 ' A rat, I suppose, scampering across the floor. But let us go. We have been in this dismal place long enough.' They moved away together, treading carefully, and passed out by the same way that they had entered. The moment the door closed behind them the two lovers sprang to their feet, poor Fanny in the utmost distress, divided between terror at the strange discussion she had just overheard and dread of being discovered in company with the lieutenant under such awkward circumstances. ' We must give them time to get away,' whispered Teddy, trying to reassure her, as they groped their way towards the door. ' I shall never forgive myself ! What will happen if they come back and find us ? ' she cried, wringing her hands. ' My mother will do something dreadful if she hears of this.' ' Ah ! Look ! ' The exclamation came from Teddy, who had suddenly perceived a glimmer of light underneath the door they were approaching. ' Quick, Fanny, go back to where you were. I will see, that no one finds you.' The terrified girl sped back to her former hiding-place, as the door was cautiously thrust open, and the threatening face of Sturmer appeared in the opening, lit up by a candle"], [31, "THE THRONE ROOM 21 which he held in one hand, while the other rested on his sword. At the first sight of Hervey the Hanoverian uttered an ex clamation, and drew back hastily. The instant after he recovered himself, stepped inside the room, and closed the door, setting his back against it. ' So it is you, Mr. Hervey,' he said, eyeing the young man half in doubt, half in menace. It was not the first time they had met. When two men are both engaged in making love to the same young lady they are pretty sure to come across each other, and pretty sure to heartily dislike each other. Hervey, who was not taken by surprise like the Baron, had considered the best line to adopt, and now responded to the other's remark in a manner intended to convey the impression that he was intoxicated. By this means he hoped to disarm Sturmer's suspicions, and make him think that his dangerous confidences were safe. ' As y' see, m' dear Baron ! Making m' rounds as usual, y' know. I'm th' officer-th' guard.' For a moment Sturmer, with all his astuteness, was taken in by the lieutenant's acting. 'What are you doing in this part of the Palace?' he demanded in the tone of a superior. Hervey shook his head with affected slyness. ' No, no, m'dear flow, that cock won't fight, y'know. I'm th' officer-th' guard. Th' question is, what th' deuce are you doing 'n this part-th' Palace, don't y' know ? ' The Hanoverian bit his lip, and gave an angry glance at the young officer. ' I am prepared to account for my conduct to my master the Duke of Cumberland,' he said shortly. And he made a step forward. The lieutenant again shook his head, with a mocking smile, and placed himself in the way. ' That won't do, either, y' know. My master's th' King of England, and I can't allow you t' pass.' The Baron began to suspect that he was being played with."], [32, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 22 Holding the light towards the lieutenant's face, he said angrily \u2014 ' It strikes me, sir, that you are not so drunk as you pretend. I don't know how long you have been in this room, or how much you have overheard. Is it any part of the duties of the officer of the guard, may I ask, to play the spy ? ' Hervey felt himself flushing angrily at this taunt, in spite of the part he was endeavouring to play. He restrained him self, however, and answered good-humouredly \u2014 ' That's unfair, it really is. How could I foresee that you would choose the Throne Room, of all places in the world, to hatch treason in ? ' At the word 'treason,' Sturmer made a slight movement backward, and shot a questioning glance at the lieutenant, as if to discover whether he was joking or serious. But Teddy's face betrayed nothing. ' Come, Baron,' he said, dropping the pretence of intoxica- tion, ' it is time for me to close this room. Let us go back to the company.' ' Not till I have examined every inch of this place, to see whether anybody else is concealed here,' retorted the Hanoverian. At the same time he raised the light over his head, and made another step forward. Hervey planted himself in the way. ' Stop ! Not another foot ! I forbid it ! ' The words rang out in a very different tone from that he had previously been using. The Baron recoiled, surprised. Then a dangerous light flashed in his eye, and he laid his hand significantly on his sword-hilt. ' I insist ! I will know who has been listening, in here ! ' ' No ! You will not.' And as Sturmer attempted to move forward, the young officer's blade leaped from its sheath like a ribbon of lightningi and glittered in front of the other man's breast. Sturmer drew back a step. ' Is this a duel ?' he demanded, ' or is it an arrest ? '"], [33, "THE THRONE ROOM 23 Hervey reflected for an instant. But he dared not keep up the pretence of being on duty. ' It is a duel, if you persist,' he answered firmly. A cold, hard smile crept round the corners of the German's mouth. Stepping to one side, he set down the candle on the floor, where its rays made a misty ring of light in the cavern like darkness all around. Then with a swift jerk his own sword was bared, and the two blades locked together with a sharp clink. ' Stop, gentlemen ! ' Teddy dropped his point with a muttered curse ; and his enemy started back in sheer consternation, as a fair young figure, clad in white, started up from the shadows at the far end of the room, and rushed swiftly to the spot, to part the combatants. The next moment the Baron had recognised her, and political alarms gave way to others of a still more galling nature. ' Lady Fanny Greville ! You here ! ' A profound silence followed, as the agitated girl laid her hand on Teddy's arm, and gazed shrinkingly at the Hanoverian's wrathful countenance. The young man at length spoke for her. ' Since this lady has chosen to disclose herself, there is no reason why I should attempt any further concealment. I have not the honour to be publicly engaged to Lady Fanny, but we have been privately engaged since we were boy and girl, and we are only waiting for the Countess's consent. You will therefore please to understand that the only reason why I wished to keep secret the fact of Lady Fanny's presence here was lest it might reach her mother's ears. We had strolled out into the corridor from the Duke of Cumberland's suite, when we heard you and some other person coming after us. To escape being seen, we retired in here, never dreaming that you would follow us, or that we should be obliged to overhear any of your conversation.' Sturmer listened thoughtfully to this explanation, a frown contracting his bushy eyebrows."], [34, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN! 24 ' Suppose all this is so,' he said, ' what guarantee have I that you will not now go straight from here and repeat what you have heard to others ? ' Teddy pointed to his companion. ' This lady is your guarantee. Respect her secret and we will both respect yours. Silence for silence.' The Baron returned his blade to the sheath, and slammed it down. ' I accept, Mr. Hervey. And to prevent any possible questioning on the part of the Countess, I will give Lady Fanny my arm to take her back into the drawing-rooms.' Teddy was about to reject this offer, when Fanny silenced him by a glance, and, placing her arm within the Baron's, allowed him to lead her away. The lieutenant let them go on in front, and waited five or ten minutes before he made his own way back to the scene of the royal reception. There, as soon as he returned, he found himself in the midst of a group of his own comrades, who began to rally him on his long absence. 'Why, Teddy, what mischief have you been up to? We thought you had given us the slip for the evening,' exclaimed one good-natured-looking giant. ' So I meant to,' returned Teddy, with a grimace, ' but I wasn't smart enough. How could I see a man like you in the crowd ? ' ' Well, now you are here, come in to supper with us,' put in another ; ' we have been waiting for you.' ' I call that real friendship. Let's go, then.' They were moving away, when they were met by an older man in colonel's uniform, who singled out Teddy from the group. * Mr. Hervey ! ' The lieutenant stopped, wondering, and rather nervous. It was the commander of his battalion. ' The Duke of Cumberland has desired me to present you to him,' explained the Colonel. 'This way.' He beckoned the young man to follow, and led him up to where the Prince was standing."], [35, "THE THRONE ROOM 25 By the side of His Royal Highness was Baron Sturmer, who glanced at the lieutenant with an expression at once of warning and encouragement. Teddy saw it all. This was to be his reward for keeping the secret of the conversation he had overheard. He bowed low over the Prince's extended hand. ' I am glad to know you, Mr. Hervey,' observed his Royal Highness, with an extraordinary effort to be gracious. ' I have a particular friendship for the gentlemen of the Guards. You have not long been gazetted, I believe.' ' Only a year, sir.' ' So much as that ! Sturmer, how is it you haven't brought this young gentleman to me before ? No doubt, Mr. Hervey, you belong to the Wisbeach family ? ' ' The present viscount is my father, sir. But I am only the third son.' ' Then your fortune depends on yourself. I hope it will be prosperous. I shall expect to see you here again before very long.' Thus graciously dismissed, Teddy went to rejoin his friends. He recounted the Duke's polite phrases, as they lounged round the supper-table, and his brother officers congratulated him. Fresh bottles were opened, and they drank to the health of their royal host \u2014 ' The Guards' friend ! ' The only exception to the general cheerfulness was the oldest member of the party, the captain of Hervey's company, who enjoyed the brevet rank of major. While the others were drinking and talking in loud tones, he sat a little apart, a thoughtful frown on his face. ' What's the matter with Campbell ? ' demanded the giant who was leading the revels. ' You look as if you thought you were at a funeral.' ' No one will ever think you are a corpse, as long as there is a bottle in front of you,' was the retort. ' Are you afraid of being cashiered, in order that the Prince may give your company to Hervey ? ' inquired one of the others, a red-faced man with sandy hair and freckles. ' No, Metcalfe, I am not afraid of that, because the Prince"], [36, "26 'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' has not yet got the disposal of the companies in the Household Brigade.' The words were spoken quietly, but with a certain chill emphasis that seemed to disconcert the man addressed. He turned to the lieutenant. ' Well, old man, if you do get a staff appointment, don't forget your old friends.' Teddy laughed, and, tossing off a final glass, rose from the table. As he was passing out of the supper-room, he felt an arm passed through his, and Major Campbell's voice whispered in his ear \u2014 ' When you go off duty, come round to my rooms. I have something to say to you. And in the meantime be careful what you say and do.'"], [37, "27 CHAPTER III A DANGEROUS ACQUAINTANCE As soon as he had given his warning to the young lieutenant, Major Campbell quitted the royal reception, and took his way back to the barracks of the'regiment. On reaching his own quarters he was surprised to find a letter awaiting him, bearing the official seal of the Horse Guards. He tore it open with a good deal of curiosity. It was couched in these terms : ' Sir, I am directed by the Commander of the Forces to request that you will favour him with a call here to-morrow morning at eleven of the clock, on confidential business. I have the honour to be your most obedient servant, F. Ponsonby Trevor, Military Secretary. 'To Major Campbell, Sec' That was all. The meaning of the summons, the nature of the business which the Commander of the Forces desired to discuss with him, were left to Campbell's imagination. Fortunately he was not a nervous man. Instead of worry ing himself with conjectures as to what was in store for him, he quietly put the letter aside, exchanged his uniform coat for a dressing gown, lit a cigar, and sat down quietly to read till the lieutenant should arrive. This was not till some hours later. On leaving the supper room, Teddy had searched everywhere for his sweetheart, but she was not to be found. Sturmer had brought her back to her mother, who was left under the comforting belief that Fanny had been with the Baron all the time. Shortly afterwards the Countess carried her daughter home, without giving her an opportunity of seeing Hervey to say farewell."], [38, "28 ' GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ! ' The young man wandered out into the courtyard of the Palace, where he paced up and down by himself, his thoughts turning on the events of the evening, the new position about to be filled by Fanny, the dangerous rivalry of Sturmer, the disturbing conversation to which he had been a listener, and about which he was pledged to silence, and the sudden favour shown him by the Duke of Cumberland. In vain he sought to interpret the vague utterances of the two plotters in the Throne Room, and to understand the nature of their schemes. Then he reflected on the singular warning addressed to him by his friend Campbell, a man who had already shown a steady interest in him, and rendered him many little acts of kindness. What did it all mean ? Was there something going on around him, something of a secret and dangerous character, in which he would be involved on one side or the other ? He ended by hoping that it might be so, and that he might find himself engaged in a struggle with Baron Sturmer, with Fanny's hand as the prize of victory. From these dreams he was roused at length by a stream of departing guests, showing that the Duke of Cumberland had given the signal for the close of the entertainment. In due time the last carriage rolled away, and the lieutenant found himself free to march his men back to barracks. As soon as the detachment was dismissed he hastened, without changing his dress, to Campbell's rooms, where he found the Major patiently awaiting him. ' Ah, come in, Hervey ! What will you drink ? ' Campbell went to his buffet and took out two decanters, one containing brandy and the other rum. The virtues of whisky were not yet appreciated in England. ' Well, what is the mystery ? ' Teddy asked lightly, while the other was pouring out the spirit. Campbell shook his head gravely. ' You and I have always been good friends, Hervey, and I think you are a more sensible fellow than some of those youngsters. Now I want to ask you one question \u2014 what do you know of that man Sturmer?' Teddy looked up, startled."], [39, "A DANGEROUS ACQUAINTANCE 29 ' Not much. Why ? ' ' Is he your friend or your enemy ? ' ' I hardly know that, even. But why do you ask this ? ' ' Because I have watched that man for some time ; and I know that he is a dangerous man to have for an enemy ; and I am not sure that he is not even more dangerous to have for a friend. Look to yourself if there is any tie between him and you.' ' What do know about him then ? ' ' Ah, that is another question. I have given you a warning, by which you can profit if you choose. If you want me to tell you all I know about this man, it is for you to speak first.' Teddy began to feel uneasy. How much would it be pos sible for him to tell the cautious Scotchman without breaking the pledge he had given ? ' I may tell you this,' he said slowly, ' that Baron Sturmer and I are rivals. You know Lady Fanny Greville ? ' ' Yes.' The tone was singularly hard. ' Well, Sturmer is persecuting her with his attentions. She says she will never marry him, because \u2014 because, in fact, she and I are ' 'I understand,' said the Major roughly, interrupting the embarrassed young man. 'All the more reason that you should beware of that man. He is capable of more than you know.' 'At the same time,' pursued Teddy, trying to overcome the feeling of apprehension which was gaining on him, ' I happen to have a certain hold over him. And I believe the Duke of Cumberland's notice of me this evening was due to Sturmer's influence.' ' That I do not doubt,' said Campbell dryly. ' Whether the Duke of Cumberland's friendship will do you good is another thing. But if it is true that you have a hold over him, I know of no surer way to make a man like that your mortal enemy. Come, you had better tell me something more. You're not afraid to trust me ? ' ' It isn't that, Campbell,' said Teddy earnestly. ' I should be only too glad to tell you the whole story, and get your"], [40, "\u2022GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 30 opinion on it. But the fact is I'm under a promise to the fellow.' ' That settles it. You mustn't break your word, even to him.' ' I'll tell you how I came to give it, though.' And Teddy proceeded to relate his adventure with Lady Fanny, merely omitting the name of Sturmer's companion and the nature of their discussion. ' I don't see any way out of it for the present, so long as he keeps his part of the bargain,' commented Campbell. ' But perhaps I can make a better guess than you think at what Sturmer and his friend were talking about.' Teddy glanced at him with eager curiosity. ' However, I won't go into that now. I mustn't tempt you to break faith. Only remember what I have said to you. There is danger in associating with that man, as you may find out for yourself before long.' ' But I have no intention of associating with him. I don't expect to see anything more of him,' said Teddy, frowning. ' On the contrary, it is my belief that you are likely to see a good deal more of him,' retorted the Major significantly. ' You know his position, don't you ? ' ' I know that he is a creature of the Duke of Cumberland's, if that is what you mean.' ' There you are wrong. Sturmer is not the Prince's crea ture. He is his master. It is the Prince who is his creature.' Hervey opened his eyes. The other went on calmly. ' For years the Prince has been getting more and more under Sturmer's influence, deeper and deeper into his power. What is the secret of this power you may guess for yourself. It is said the Prince owes him immense sums of money, that the revenues of Hanover are mortgaged in advance to this man, and that the Prince is dependent on him for supplies from day to day. Anyhow, you may be sure of this, that whatever the Duke of Cumberland does, Sturmer knows of it beforehand ; and whatever Sturmer does, he will carry the Duke with him.' Hervey saw that there was something under the surface in these words of Campbell's, but he felt that it would be useless to question him further for the present."], [41, "A DANGEROUS ACQUAINTANCE 31 'And what do you advise me to do ? ' he inquired. 'At present you can do nothing but watch and listen. You may find out something before long. Unless I am mistaken you will have a visit from Sturmer before many hours are over.' ' What ! ' ' I mean it. That man has made up his mind to secure you. You will have to make him think he has succeeded, or be prepared for his vengeance.' Teddy laughed, with an assumption of scepticism greater than he really felt. ' My dear Campbell, you talk as if we were in Venice, in the days of the Council of Ten. Surely you don't anticipate poison and stilettos. And as far as a duel goes, why I dare say I can handle a sword as well as this German.' 'So much the better. He has a formidable reputation, though I don't think he has been out for some years, now.' 1 Pooh ! I must have a turn at the foils with you at Plangin's, to convince you that Herr Sturmer doesn't quite hold my life in the hollow of his hand.' ' Well, promise me that you will be careful. And if you do learn anything serious, let me know at once.' Teddy gave the promise, and retired to his own quarters, where he went straight to bed, and forgot his perplexities in a sound and dreamless slumber. So soundly did he sleep that it seemed to him that he had only just closed his eyes when he was aroused by the entrance of his servant with the shaving-water. Springing lightly from his bed, he began to perform his toilette with the scrupulous care of one who feels his responsibilities as a leader of fashion able youth. ' Here, Mike, you scoundrel, you haven't varnished those boots ! A dry towel, quick ! Pull up that blind ! Now, where are my lavender pantaloons ? I'm not going on parade, you fool. Put my sword away.' The grinning servant listened to this torrent of directions with the philosophic calm of a man who is far too wise to"], [42, "\u25a0GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 32 attempt doing two things at once, and generally contrives to do neither. ' Is your honour ready for breakfast ? ' 'Yes. I don't want anything except coffee and a roll. Any letters ? ' 'No letters, sir.' Bringing in a small tray piled with unpleasant-looking blue missives, the Irishman added, ' Only bills, your honour.' ' Throw them away, then. I really can't wade through all that lot this morning. I wish these people would remember that my time is of some value. I wonder how they can find time to keep sending their absurd things.' The pile of unopened accounts was swept into a cupboard, to await the lieutenant's leisure. Then the coffee and roll appeared, and he made a hasty meal. Scarcely was it ended when a knock came at the door. ' Go and see who that is, Mike, and tell them to go to blazes. I'm not up yet,' said Teddy, who was still in his dressing-gown, a gorgeous article in richly flowered silk. The faithful Mike went to the outer door, and found no less a person than Sturmer himself. ' Is Mr. Hervey in ? ' ' He is that, sir ; but he's just after getting out of bed, sir, and he told me to say he would be very much obliged if your honour would call back a little later.' Thus delicately did the diplomatic Irishman paraphrase his master's instructions. But the Baron proved persistent. ' Just take in my card to your master, and ask him if he will excuse my coming in now, without ceremony.' Mike took the card gingerly between his finger and thumb, as though he suspected it of being a writ in disguise, and brought it to the lieutenant. No sooner did Hervey see the name on it than he gave vent to something like an imprecation. ' Campbell was right ! Well, I suppose I must see him. Show the Baron in, Mike, and then you may make yourself scarce for half an hour.'"], [43, "A DANGEROUS ACQUAINTANCE 33 The next moment Sturmer entered, and was greeting the lieutenant in the tone of an old friend. He had evidently come determined to propitiate, and his naturally forbidding countenance wore the most amiable expression of which it was capable. ' My dear Mr. Hervey,' he cried, as he settled himself com fortably in a chair, ' I can't think how it is that we haven't seen more of each other before. Nearly the whole of your mess are my friends, I think. His Royal Highness was quite severe with me last night for not having brought you to him before ; he was indeed, I give you my word.' Teddy bowed politely. The previous night this effusive warmth might have imposed on him. Now, fresh from the Major's warnings, it only put him on his guard. ' I have not joined very long,' he answered modestly. ' I must not flatter myself with the idea that the Prince can really be interested in an obscure person like myself.' 'But, my dear fellow, you are entirely mistaken,' the Baron exclaimed eagerly. 'The Prince takes the greatest interest in you. You don't know his Royal Highness, Mr Hervey. The world doesn't know him. Under a cold, reserved exterior, he hides the utmost goodness of heart. Of course during his brother's lifetime etiquette keeps him in the background. He can't do so much for his friends as he would like. But if he should ever ascend the throne, it will be a fortunate thing for those who have won his good will.' ' I am sure of that,' responded Hervey, still wondering what the Baron was driving at. ' It would be a fortunate thing for the country too,' the Hanoverian added. ' It seems a thousand pities that England and Hanover should have different laws as to the succession. Why should the two countries be separated now, after a union of a century and a quarter? But I am afraid you don't sympathise with my feelings on that point.' ' On the contrary,' protested the lieutenant, ' I quite share your regret. But I am afraid it is too late to think of altering the law.' * Perhaps so. What makes the situation so serious is the D"], [44, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 34 youth of Princess Alexandrina Victoria. You know the Re formers are openly boasting that she will be a mere puppet in their hands, and the Tories will never be in office again ? I know something of your family, Mr. Hervey, and I am sure you are no friend to this Catholic movement in England.' ' Catholic movement ? I confess I don't understand. Do you mean Emancipation ? ' ' Not so much Emancipation as what it may lead to. I happen to know that the Pope has emissaries in this country \u2014 ay, in the Court itself \u2014 who are leaving no stone unturned to bring about the restoration of the Roman supremacy. Remember that the first woman who ever sat on the English throne brought about one reconciliation with Rome, and don't be surprised, if the Princess Alexandrina succeeds, to see the same thing over again within ten years.' Teddy gazed at the speaker in some consternation. It is true that Sturmer's suggestions were the common topic of extreme partisans of that time. Strange as it seems to a generation accustomed to regard the throne as outside the sphere of party politics, it is certain that at this time the accession of the Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent was looked forward to by both sides as a triumph for the party led by Lord Melbourne, and an overwhelming blow for their opponents. It was a time, too, when party feeling was more embittered than it has often been, except during civil war. The aristocracy and the people stood in opposite camps. The prolonged struggle over the Reform Bill had brought each class to regard the other as its deadly foe. There were nobles who believed that England was on the verge of revolution, and saw in prospect the horrors of a Reign of Terror ; there were democrats who believed that only a revolution could save their class from being trodden under foot by aristocratic tyranny. Sagacious observers, like the young author of ' Sybil,' thought that it needed very little to set the two parties in the nation at each other's throats. The situation was aggravated by the fact that the nation was in one of its periodical frenzies against Popery. Lord Melbourne's Government was kept in office by Irish votes, and"], [45, "A DANGEROUS ACQUAINTANCE 35 this fact was artfully seized upon by their enemies, as threaten ing danger to the Protestant faith. From this, to representing the young Princess as a victim to Popish wiles, was but a step ; and some of the reckless innuendoes in circulation had already reached the ears of the young Guardsman, before they received weight and seriousness by coming from the lips of a man in the confidence of the Princess's nearest relation. 'Surely you don't suggest that the Princess has any real leaning towards the Church of Rome ? ' he asked in dismay. Sturmer looked round the room, and lowered his voice as he replied \u2014 ' Don't be too sure of that. Between ourselves, I have reason to know that her uncle is anxious on the point. I must not tell you all I have heard. But in any case, it is certain that a young girl of eighteen will have no will of her own apart from the Ministry ; and you know as well as I do that Daniel O'Connell carries the Ministers in his pocket.' Hervey found it difficult to reply to this remark, which was too much like what he was accustomed to hear among his own family and friends. His father was one of the Duke of Wellington's followers in the Lords, and had been a bitter opponent of a Reform Bill which had robbed him of three rotten boroughs. Sturmer saw his advantage, and shrewdly decided to leave with the impression he had made. ' Let us hope that the King will be long-lived,' he said, as he rose to go. ' But we ought to be preparing for eventualities, and the friends of religion and good government ought to associate themselves together. Come and dine with me this evening, if you will. Some of your friends will be there, and we can talk things over together.' Still somewhat confused by the way in which the Baron seemed to be taking possession of him, Teddy murmured his acceptance. They shook hands, and Sturmer went off, a cynical, self-satisfied smile curving his cruel lips. D 2"], [46, "36 'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' CHAPTER IV A GRAVE INVESTIGATION A few minutes before eleven the same morning Major Campbell presented himself at the Horse Guards, and sent up his card to the Commander of the Forces. Almost imme diately the orderly returned, and conducted him into Lord Hill's presence. The famous Peninsular veteran, who enjoyed a popularity only second to that of the Iron Duke before the Iron Duke became a politician, was seated before his desk, alone. At Campbell's entrance he rose, shook hands with bluff cordiality, and pointed to a chair. ' Glad to see you, Major Campbell. Have heard of you from your commanding officer. Best company officer in the regiment. Wish we had more like you.' The Scotchman bowed in silence, with a secret thrill of pride at being spoken to like this by the head of his profes sion. ' In consequence of what I have been told about you, I have asked you to come here,' continued the Commander of the Forces. 'I want you to undertake inquiry \u2014 very serious and delicate inquiry. Can't very well entrust it to senior officer\u2014 wouldn't have the same opportunities of getting at truth. Same time I wouldn't trust ordinary junior\u2014 empty-headed young fellows. Think of nothing but cut of their clothes and the women.' Campbell gave a second bow. He was wise enough to hold his tongue till it was time for him to speak. Lord Hill noticed and approved this taciturnity. ' See you are a prudent man, Mr. Campbell ; can trust you."], [47, "A GRAVE INVESTIGATION 37 Now, I've sent for you about a very serious business. Have you noticed anything remarkable about the duels that have taken place in the army lately ? ' The Major looked up in some surprise. He thought for a moment before he answered. ' I had not noticed anything myself, sir. But, now you speak of it, it does seem to me that duelling has been on the increase lately.' Lord Hill nodded. ' Thought you would say that. But do you know you are wrong ? Duelling in the army hasn't increased \u2014 has fallen off, in fact.' Campbell gave his superior an inquiring look, but without opening his lips. ' Wonder what I mean ? I'll tell you. Duels in army generally have been less numerous ; duels in Guard regiments much more numerous. Understand ? ' 'I think I do, my lord. No doubt I have taken my impression from what has happened in the regiments I see most of. In my own mess, for instance, there have been two fatal duels in the last twelve months.' Lord Hill sat up abruptly in his chair, and fixed the younger man with a stern, questioning glance. ' Do you know what you have said, sir ? You have put your finger on the grave point in the whole business. It isn't because duels are more numerous, but because duels in the Guards are nearly always fatal.' He pronounced the last words with an emphasis which struck a chill to Campbell's heart, as he realised the terrible suggestion that underlay them. 'The men fight oftener with pistols, instead of swords, now,' he ventured to say hesitatingly. The Commander of the Forces shook his head. ' No use saying that. Don't believe that accounts for it. It's a very serious state of things, and I'm determined to get to the bottom of it. I've selected you as the best man to under take the inquiry. What do you say ? ' ' I will do my best, sir.'"], [48, "38 'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' ' That's right. That's the kind of answer I like to have. Take as much leave as you like ; I'll give you a letter to your colonel. Go about among different battalions, talk to 'em, find out what you can about these affairs. If you get on track of anything suspicious, report to me at once. Say nothing to anybody else. Understand? That'll do.' While he was jerking out these sentences, the Commander of the Forces was scribbling a note with his own hand. He hastily sanded it, sealed it up, and handed it to Campbell, who rose to his feet to receive it. ' Give that to Colonel Norris. I've told him to give you what leave you want ; entrusted you with confidential mission. Good morning, Major Campbell.' ' Good morning, my lord.' The Major came away profoundly impressed with Lord Hill's communication, and revolving in his own mind how to set about his grave investigation. While Campbell was thus occupied, his younger friend was much more pleasantly engaged. As soon as Teddy found himself released from the presence of the formidable Baron, he made preparations to go out him self. His servant had not returned, so he was obliged to put on the final articles of attire unaided. His coat, of something the same shape as the modern swallow-tail, was made of bottle green cloth, and was worn over two waistcoats, the outer one of lavender-coloured satin. The hat, the forerunner of the present day article, closely resembled an inverted flower-pot, the top being very contracted, and the brim narrow and much curled. The lower limbs were closely encased in a garment which fitted like the tights of a ballet-dancer, and terminated in patent leather shoes tied with black silk ribbons. Throwing a long gold chain round his neck, and tucking the ends into one of his waistcoat pockets, the lieutenant had only to draw on a pair of deerskin gloves, and he was ready for Pall Mall. Half a dozen canes of ebony or malacca stood in a corner of the room. He selected the most imposing of these, adorned with two large bright-coloured tassels, and sallied forth."], [49, "A GRAVE INVESTIGATION 39 'I am going to the club,' he announced to himself in a firm voice, as he quitted the barracks, and turned in an easterly direction. No sooner did the lieutenant emerge from the barrack gates than a man in the dress of a stable hand, who had been lounging with half-shut eyes against a wall just outside, woke up, and began shuffling along on the other side of the way, at a distance which enabled him to keep the young officer in view. At first Teddy kept on briskly in the direction of Saint James's Street. But after a little while, as if in obedience to some unseen dynamic force, his course began to describe an irregular parabola, which terminated finally at Hyde Park Corner, where Apsley House still displayed the iron shutters that had been necessary to protect the victor of Waterloo from the London mob. Arrived at this point the young man hesitated, and stood still for one or two minutes. He did not observe a stableman who had come to a halt at the same time on the pavement by Saint George's Hospital, and was leaning against a post, throwing glances every now and then in his direction. ' It is absurd ! I'll go down Piccadilly ! ' Teddy exclaimed at last. And then, instantly turning his back on Piccadilly, he stepped off at a brisk pace towards Kensington. Kensington Gardens at that time lay practically on the out skirts of London. When Hervey had passed through the old wicket gate, near where the Albert Memorial now stands, he found himself alone, save for a solitary straggler who lounged in after him, apparently in mere aimless caprice. All the better pleased by this solitude, the lieutenant advanced between the trees, taking a north-west course which ultimately brought him past the site of the Round Pond, and up to the palings of the private grounds of Kensington Palace. Arrived at this point Teddy was compelled to pause. After curiously scanning the walls of the Palace, wondering in what part of the rambling structure his sweetheart was con cealed, he turned and paced up and down for a short time on the grass, within full view of the windows, Then suddenly"], [50, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 40 realising that he might be making himself too conspicuous, he drew off as far as the broad path leading from Kensington High Street to the Oxford Road. Here he flung himself down on a bench and waited. As he did so, he noticed a figure like that of a groom out of work, strolling along the edge of the Round Pond, and throwing crumbs to the ducks as they swam past him. Suddenly the young man sprang from his seat with a cry of delight. A girl in a white cambric frock and dark green bonnet was walking towards him from the direction of the Palace. He greeted her with all the confidence of youth. But his presumption was destined to receive a rude shock. ' What do you mean by behaving like this, Edward ? ' she demanded with asperity, refusing to notice his extended hand. ' Marching up and down in front of the windows like that ; people will think you are a burglar ! If you have no regard for yourself, have some for me. Do you want to make me the laughing-stock of the household ? ' * My dear Fanny,' stammered the dismayed Edward, ' I had no idea of annoying you. I only came out here on the chance that I might get a passing glimpse of you at a window.' ' Don't be silly, Edward. What is there about me that you should want to see me so particularly ? ' This was an opening such as no lover could well miss. Edward at once began to declaim vehemently in answer to the question, winding up with expressions which appeared to produce a favourable impression on his audience, but which would seem unintelligible and imbecile if they were reduced to writing. ' There, Teddy, that will do,' said Fanny mildly, when his eloquence was exhausted. ' But you ought not to have come here so soon. Do you know the Princess saw you?' ' Did she though ! I hope she wasn't angry ? ' ' No, she wasn't angry. She seemed rather amused, though. I was in her boudoir when we noticed you. She wondered who you were, and I told her ; and then it came"], [51, "A GRAVE INVESTIGATION 41 out that you were a friend of mine. The Princess smiled a good deal when she heard that, and asked me whether I shouldn't like a run out in the gardens for half an hour.' Teddy murmured a blessing on her Royal Highness. ' I said I thought perhaps you had some important message for me, and she said : \" Tell Mr. Hervey he is quite at liberty to present himself at the Palace if that should be the case at any time.\" I was afraid she was joking, but I didn't dare to ask her. I never feel afraid of the Princess, but I always feel very respectful in her presence.' Teddy considered for a minute. Should he tell Fanny anything of the hints he had received\u2014 the dangerous ground on which he found himself walking? He came to the conclusion that it might be better to prepare her for con tingencies. ' I am not sure that I may not have to take advantage of the Princess Alexandrina's permission,' he began. ' Don't say \" Alexandrina,\" ' Fanny interrupted. ' Her Royal Highness herself told me that she prefers her second name. When she ascends the throne she means to reign as Queen Victoria.' The young man bowed. The magic of the syllables sounded in his ear like a deep trumpet-blast, and stirred his heart with a prophetic thrill, as if already he could feel the glamour of the sixty years of freedom and happiness and glory that were to make that name immortal in the annals of the world. 'That time may be nearer than we think,' said Hervey. ' You heard what those men said last night about this illness of the King's?' ' Yes, and I think the Duchess of Kent has had bad news. She seemed anxious when she received me to-day. But, do you know, Teddy, I have been thinking since about that con versation. I am almost sorry we promised to keep it secret. I feel sure there is something wrong going on.' ' That is just what I was going to say to you. I have heard from another quarter that Baron Sturmer is a most dangerous man. I don't know yet what is in his mind, but I may before longi"], [52, "' GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ! ' 42 because he has taken a sudden friendship for me. He called on me this morning, and I am going to dine with him to-night.' ' Teddy ! You astonish me ! But you will be careful, won't you ? You won't let this man lead you into danger ? ' ' Not if I can help it, certainly. But I must try and find out more about him.' He hesitated for a moment, and then added, ' He is very prejudiced against the Princess.' ' What ! Has he dared to speak against her ? ' cried Fanny, with flashing eyes. 'Not directly. But he says that, if she succeeds to the crown, the country will be given over to the Radicals and Papists. Do you think the Princess has any Romish tendencies ? ' ' For shame ! No ! I won't have you say such things. Her Royal Highness is as sound a Churchwoman as I am. And as for the Radicals, it seems to me that they are a good deal more loyal than the Tories. The Princess is my princess, and if she were a Mahometan, I should love her just the same ; and unless you want me to hate you, so will you ! ' Having fired off this slightly incoherent profession of faith, the beauty started up to go. ' One minute ! ' protested Teddy, making her sit down again. ' I am as loyal to the Princess Victoria as you are. If Sturmer has any intrigue on foot that would be against her interests, I shall find it out, and come here at once and let you know.' ' That's right. Do, Teddy, and then I can tell the Princess.' ' And you won't be afraid of my making you the laughing stock of the household ? ' Fanny laid her hand on his lips in playful remonstrance. The next instant she caught the distant stableman looking towards them, and snatched it away again, but not before the happy Teddy had had time to imprint a kiss on it. ' Behave, sir 1 ' she pouted, rising once more. ' Don't you see that man over by the pond is watching us ? ' ' Is that all ? ' cried the lieutenant. He glanced round ; the loafer had turned his back, and was once more feeding the ducks. Not another soul was in sight. The sunshine was very"], [53, "A GRAVE INVESTIGATION 43 cheerful, the air was very balmy, the trees were deliriously green, and the birds were singing most exuberantly in the branches. The reckless Teddy bent forward suddenly, and wrecked the muslin gown and the green bonnet for ever. The next minute the spy looked round again. All he saw was a young lady walking quietly away from the seat towards the Palace, tossing her head till the ringlets shook like bluebells in a wind \u2014 it was too far for him to see the bright sparkle of her eyes, and the joyous dimples that would persist in creeping out on each side of her mouth ; while a young gentleman moved slowly, with a hangdog air, as though he had just been dismissed in disgrace, down the pathway leading to Hyde Park. Before he had gone very far, however, Teddy's step recovered its elastic strength, and it was in the best of spirits, and humming an air from the new opera, that he turned into Piccadilly. The evening of the same day found the lieutenant faithful to his engagement at Baron Stunner's house, a fine mansion in Saint James's Square, furnished in a way that justified the rumours regarding its owner's wealth. The dinner hour was eight, and when he entered Hervey found there already three officers of his own battalion. These were Metcalfe, the florid man with sandy hair and freckles, another captain named De Vaux, and a newly joined ensign who bore the title of Viscount Ely. Not one of the three was exactly a friend of his, though he had rubbed against them in the regular intimacy of the mess. The Baron was in his most cordial mood, and by nine o'clock, when the cloth was drawn, and the decanters of sherry and port began to circulate, the party were on very good terms with one another. In placing them at table, etiquette had been observed ; so that Hervey found himself on his host's left, opposite the little viscount, with Metcalfe next to him, and De Vaux beside the ensign. ' Gentlemen,' said Sturmer, rising to his feet as soon as every glass was filled, ' I ask you to drink the King ! '"], [54, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 44 The other four rose and emptied their glasses. But there was a certain seriousness in the way they did it ; and as soon as they were seated again, Metcalfe inquired \u2014 ' Is there any fresh news from Windsor ? The last sounded as though the King were seriously ill.' 'The King is seriously ill,' the Hanoverian answered gravely. ' It is impossible to foresee the result, but my own belief is that we are on the eve of a crisis which will call for our courage and loyalty.' ' So much the better,' remarked De Vaux, whose dark face seemed to wear a perpetual scowl. ' Unless we want to see the Church trampled underfoot, and the gentry forced to flee for their lives from a rebellious mob.' ' It is an event which will either make or mar us,' said the Baron. ' What do you say, Lord Ely ? ' ' I agree with De Vaux. Anything to crush those cursed beggars, don't you know,' answered the viscount, who had already been drinking pretty freely. ' It is well we have a leader who is determined to stand by the cause of Protestantism and law and order,' said Metcalfe. ' With Ernest, Duke of Cumberland, at the head of the State, there wouldn't be much to fear.' ' That's what I say,' Ely broke in again. ' I stand by the Prince ; don't you, De Vaux ? ' De Vaux threw a watchful glance across the table at Hervey, who had taken no part in this conversation. ' I should like to hear what Hervey says. Do you share our feelings about the Prince ? ' Teddy roused himself. His thoughts had been wandering to a pleasanter topic, and he had hardly caught the drift of the conversation. 'The Duke of Cumberland?' he exclaimed, rousing him self at the question. 'Certainly, I yield to no man here in my devotion to his Royal Highness.' A look of satisfaction went round the table. Again the host rose to his feet. ' Another toast, gentlemen ! Saving his present Majesty only, I give you our King, Ernest the First ! '"], [55, "A GRAVE INVESTIGATION 45 ' Ernest the First ! ' rang out from the voices of the other three officers, as they drank the toast. Hervey stopped, astonished, with the glass halfway to his lips. Then he raised it again. ' Ernest the First \u2014 of Hanover ! ' he cried, in a tone of relief. ' No ! ' said Sturmer, putting out his hand. ' Ernest the First, of, Great Britain and Ireland, Defender of the Faith I '"], [56, "46 'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN! CHAPTER V constitutional law Hervey stood transfixed, half in surprise and half in indigna tion, while the glass dropped from his unconscious hand and fell in pieces on the floor. Sturmer eyed him narrowly, while affecting to be equally surprised. 'Surely, Mr. Hervey, this is not the first time you have heard of the Prince's claim to the throne ? ' ' Claim ! What claim can he have while the Princess Victoria is alive ? ' 'Gently, if you please ! You must remember that the Duke of Cumberland is my master, and that his name must be pronounced in this house with respect.' ' Certainly. I always wish to speak of the Duke with respect, as a Prince of the Blood. But I cannot be expected to listen to what I consider treason without a protest' A hostile murmur went round the table. But the Hanoverian kept his temper. ' Treason is a word which it seems premature to use on either side. If the Prince obtains the throne, it will be treason to discuss the claims of the Princess Alexandrina. At present every one is entitled to his opinion as to which is the true heir. It is simply a question of constitutional law.' Teddy was staggered. 'But do you mean to say there is any doubt about it? Surely no one has ever disputed that, since the death of the Duke of Kent, his daughter stands next to the throne ? ' 'Pardon me, some of the most eminent constitutional lawyers dispute it, and their views are shared by a number of"], [57, "CONSTITUTIONAL LAAV 47 influential personages, representing a large part of the nation. Am I right, gentlemen ? ' Cries of assent came from the other three, while the young lieutenant dropped into his chair, too bewildered to speak. Only recently come to London, and never having bothered his head about politics, he had always taken it as a matter of course that the Princess would succeed her uncle, and the news that her right to the throne was seriously contested came to him with as great a shock as it would to the present generation. Metcalfe added his confirmation to what Sturmer had been saying. ' I have no prejudice whatever against the Princess, but I certainly think Prince Ernest has a better claim to the crown, and I am heartily glad of it, He will keep Hanover united to the British Isles, and fight against these democrats who would abolish the throne altogether if they dared.' ' Surely, Hervey, you are no democrat ? ' demanded De Vaux. ' You don't want to see the country handed over to O'Connell and his gang ? ' ' That is not the question, my dear De Vaux,' said Sturmer, skilfully interposing on the lieutenant's behalf. ' I am sure Mr. Hervey feels much the same as we do about the danger of having a young girl on the throne, who would be a helpless tool in the hands of unscrupulous politicians. But as I understand it,' he added, turning to the lieutenant, ' this is the first time you have heard of the legal doubts which exist as to the succession ? You simply wish to be satisfied as to who is the rightful heir ? ' ' Certainly,' murmured Teddy, not yet recovered from his amazement. ' I thought that everybody, the King, and the Government, and the whole nation in fact, took the succession of the Princess as a matter of course.' Sturmer's lip curled sarcastically. ' They have done their best to give things that appearance. William IV. has always hated his brother ; the Ministers would raise a civil war rather than give up their power to a master whom they dread ; and, of course, the ignorant mob are more"], [58, "48 ' GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ! ' ready to shout for a young and pretty girl of whom they know nothing than for a man of sixty who has always stood out against them. Still, I should have thought that a son of Lord Wisbeach would have known of the Duke of Cumberland's claim, however little has been made of it in public. His Royal Highness prefers to wait till the throne is actually vacant before taking the necessary steps to assert his rights.' Teddy looked round him with a troubled feeling. Was this an honest question of law and right that they were dis cussing, or was it a mere insolent pretext to cover a criminal plot ? A few days before, the young Guardsman might have listened lightly enough to proposals which offered him a part in changing the succession. But now the recollection of his sweetheart's words that very day sat heavily upon him, and he realised that all his own hopes with Fanny were bound up with the fealty he had promised to Fanny's young royal mistress. Sturmer divined something, though not all, of what was passing in his mind. ' Let's talk it over quietly,' he said in easy tones, as he leant back in his chair. ' Metcalfe, you're letting the decanter stand too long. The whole question is this : by the constitu tion of England, can a female inherit the crown ? ' Teddy stared, and then let a laugh escape him. ' I should have thought that question was settled long enough ago. We have had three or four queens already \u2014 Mary, Elizabeth, Anne.' The Hanoverian gave a superior smile. 'I see your knowledge of history is not very intimate, Mr. Hervey ; or else you don't reason very well. None of those you mention, as a matter of fact, inherited the crown.' ' Why, what do you mean ? ' exclaimed Teddy, fairly out of his depth. ' Let us begin at the beginning, and then we may under stand things better. In my country of Hanover these things are settled by a family statute, which expressly excludes females from the throne. In this country I find there is no written law on the subject ; everything is governed by custom and precedent,'"], [59, "CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 49 'That's right enough,' threw in De Vaux, as the Baron cast a look round, appealing for confirmation. ' Show me a pre cedent for a female inheriting the throne, and I will swear allegiance to the Princess Alexandrina to-morrow.' ' What, ain't there one, then ? ' blurted out the little ensign. Sturmer artfully seized the opening to address his argument to Ely. ' No ; as a matter of fact, all the precedents are the other way. If you go back to Saxon times, of course the rules of succession were very irregular in those days ; but, at all events you won't find a single instance of a woman on the throne The first precedent we get after the Conquest is the case of the Empress Maud. Her father, Henry I., did his utmost to secure the crown to her, as his only surviving child ; but, the moment he was dead, she was passed over, and the crown given to Stephen, the next male heir.' ' There was a civil war, though,' objected Hervey, who felt that he ought to make some answer to the tempter. ' Of course. If the matter had not been contested, the precedent wouldn't have been so strong. I believe that is a recognised principle among your English lawyers. There was a civil war, which terminated in Stephen's favour, who sat on the throne till his death. And if you examine the roll of English sovereigns, you will find Stephen's name for the whole period from the death of Henry L, and you won't find the name of Maud at all.' ' Then do you mean to say that there was a Salic law in England ? ' demanded the lieutenant, nowthoroughly interested in the argument. ' Not exactly the Salic law ; no, that is the curious part of it. The rule seems to have been one peculiar to England, as regards the crown, though it was modelled on the universal feudal rule with regard to hereditary dignities. The rule of feudal law in all countries seems to have been this, that a fief might be transmitted, but could not be held, by a woman. You see the distinction ? A fief was held by military tenure ; a woman couldn't render military service ; and therefore she E"], [60, "' GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ! ' 50 couldn't inherit it for herself, though she might pass it on to her son.' * What about her husband ? ' put in Metcalfe, with an air of being an impartial listener. 'That was regulated by the right which the feudal lord paramount had to select the husband for an orphan heiress. In that way he practically bestowed the fief afresh. But you remember the case of Sybil, the heiress of the kingdom of Jerusalem? She married Guy de Lusignan, and he was at once crowned king, and treated as the sovereign. You must have read about the alarm of the people of England when they heard that Mary was going to marry Philip of Spain. Wyatt raised a rebellion to prevent it. No doubt the theory was that the mere act of marriage would vest the kingdom in Philip as his own. The treaty of marriage contained all kinds of strict clauses to prevent this. As it was, he was crowned king of England, their heads appeared together on the coins, and his name comes before hers in the legal documents of the reign.' ' Then the difference between the English and French laws was that in France a woman was excluded altogether, whereas in England, though she could not reign herself, she could transmit the crown to her son or husband ? ' ' To her son, certainly ; there is no precedent with regard to a husband. Take the case of the Empress Maud, again. On Stephen's death, without issue, her son Henry ascended the throne, though Maud herself was alive for another thirteen years ! How would that have been possible if Stephen had been regarded as a mere usurper ? Maud would have come over like Charles II., and dated her reign from her father's death.' Hervey could not answer this plausible reasoning, which made an impression on him in spite of himself. 'But what about later times,' he asked, 'when females did ascend the throne ? ' ' I will come to that in a minute. There is another pre cedent before them, which throws a most interesting light on the question. I mean Edward III.'s claim to the throne of France.'"], [61, "CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 51 Why, how could that affect us ? ' 'Simply by showing the notions which prevailed at the time as to the law. When Edward claimed the French throne, and the French talked about their Salic law, he did not regard that as any answer to his claim. He] said \u2014 \" Certainly, I recognise that a female cannot inherit the French crown for herself ; I don't assert that my mother is your queen ; but I say that, like every other dignity, by feudal law, a female can transmit the crown to her son, and I claim it for myself.\" That was his position, exactly corresponding with that of Henry II. two centuries before. Thirty years after Edward had assumed the title of King of France, his mother Isabel, through whom he claimed it, was still living ! But perhaps the strongest case of all is furnished by Lambert Simnel.' ' Lambert Simnel ! The pretender, do you mean ? ' ' Ah, exactly ! Do you happen to remember who he pre tended to be ? ' Teddy shook his head. His historical knowledge was not extensive enough to enable him to keep up with the Baron, who had evidently been at some pains to get up his facts. Metcalfe hazarded a guess. ' Didn't he personate one of the young Princes in the Tower?' Sturmer smiled and shook his head. ' No ! that's just the point. Perkin Warbeck personated one of them, but nothing turns on that, because, according to any view of the law, one of the young Princes would have been the rightful claimant. But Lambert Simnel personated the Earl of Warwick. Do you recollect who he was ? ' No one answered. Sturmer smiled again as he continued : 'He was the son of the unfortunate Duke of Clarence, Edward IV.'s younger brother. Now, mark this ! The Earl of Warwick could only be entitled to the throne, even in Yorkist eyes, if Edward the Fourth had left no heir. Lambert Simnel, personating the Earl, claimed the throne, and was actually crowned in Ireland, with the support of the Yorkists. Therefore \u2014 you follow me \u2014 in their opinion, and no doubt in the opinion of the age, Edward IV. had left no heir. Yet E2"], [62, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 52 during the whole time, Edward IV.'s daughter Elizabeth was alive, and sitting on the throne as Queen Consort of Henry VII. ! ' Teddy could not repress a start. He found himself being gradually emmeshed by the arguments so artfully woven by the Hanoverian. Sturmer went on : ' If the Yorkists \u2014 if public opinion \u2014 had recognised Eliza beth as the true Yorkist candidate for the throne, Lambert Simnel's adventure would have been impossible. His whole existence can only be explained on the theory that every one then recognised the law of England to be as I have stated, namely, that a female could not occupy the throne, though her son might claim through her in the absence of an heir in the male line.' ' And suppose there were no such heir ? ' demanded Hervey, thinking he had found a flaw in the Baron's reasoning at last. But Sturmer was not to be caught napping. ' Then we should have to fall back on Parliament to regu late the succession. I needn't remind you that Parliament has the power to set aside, or place on the throne, anybody it pleases, quite irrespective of abstract right. For instance, there is an Act on the Statute Book already which would ex clude the Princess at once if it were proved that she were a Papist.' ' She is not one ; I can answer for that ! ' cried Teddy thoughtlessly. Sturmer glanced at him with suspicion. He began to foresee difficulties which he had not anticipated in making a convert of the young man. ' It is to special Acts of Parliament, and not to any rule of law, that you owe the female sovereigns you have had,' he pursued. 'Parliament passed a statute enabling Henry VIII. to dispose of the crown by will, and under that Act be bequeathed it to Mary and Elizabeth. But for that they could not have reigned. Apart from their incapacity as females, both of them cannot have been legitimate ; that is to say, if the marriage with Katharine of Aragon was lawful, that with Anne Boleyn must have been unlawful. The reign of William"], [63, "CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 53 and Mary is a precedent against a female sovereign, as Mary was expressly excluded from any share in the government. Anne, again, was put on the throne by the Act of Succession, simply because there was no male heir nearer than George I. Not one of the four, I repeat, inherited the throne. No woman ever has. The whole course of English history goes to prove that a female cannot succeed to the throne in her own right.' With this staggering conclusion, the Hanoverian folded his arms and glanced round at his other three guests. Metcalfe and De Vaux shouted their approval, and little Ely, rousing himself from a doze, joined vigorously in the applause. ' I remember,' said Metcalfe, after a moment, ' hearing of an incident that confirms your view, and shows by what little things these important questions are decided. When the birth of the Princess was expected, the Duchess of Kent was living abroad. The Duke had exhausted all his resources, and a private gentleman, named William Allen, sent over funds out of his own pocket, to enable the Duchess to come over here, so that the child might be born in England. But for that we might never have heard of the Princess as a claimant to the throne.' ' Well, my dear Hervey, have I convinced you that it is not altogether treasonable to speak of Prince Ernest as our future king ? ' inquired Sturmer, concealing his anxiety beneath an ironical tone. Teddy saw that he must be careful in his answer, if he did not wish to break altogether with the others. ' Not treasonable, perhaps, but rather hopeless, I'm afraid, he responded lightly. ' You will have some difficulty in dis pelling the general belief in the Princess Victoria's rights. She is wonderfully popular with the people.' ' And the Duke of Cumberland is unpopular ? ' said Sturmer sharply, searching the other's face. ' But the feelings of the unwashed mob are surely not to influence gentlemen ? These gentlemen tell me that among their brother officers there is a very different opinion of his Royal Highness.' ' Quite so,' agreed Teddy, nodding, ' but it seems to me that the question \u2014 if there is going to be a question\u2014 must be"], [64, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 54 settled in Parliament. And you know how the present House is likely to deal with it.' The Hanoverian stamped his foot as if in a fit of vexa tion. ' That cursed Reform is at the root of the whole mischief,' he exclaimed. ' In the good old days of Lord Liverpool we could have done what we liked. A quiet little Succession Bill, declaring Prince Ernest the heir, would have settled the whole matter. Now we are face to face with this crew of Papists and Radicals, and unless we can contrive to carry our point over their heads, they will refuse to give us even a hearing.' 'You want a Cromwell to do that,' said Hervey, smiling. The Hanoverian gave him a strange glance. 'Yes, we want a Cromwell,' he said simply; and a long silence followed. Hervey felt that the other four were all watching him, to find out how he was affected by the discussion. He on his side was anxious to learn more, if possible, before committing himself. At last he put a question : 'And what likelihood is there of overcoming the opposition of Parliament ? ' But the Hanoverian was fully alive to the danger of saying anything more before the lieutenant had shown his colours. ' Ah, my friend, that is not a question which you ought to ask me. It is rather one which I should put to you. I am a mere foreigner, whose only interest in these questions arises from my personal attachment to the Duke, my master. It is for you and your brother officers to tell me what you are prepared to do.' Teddy began to feel nervous. He felt that the crisis was approaching when he must declare himself. ' I haven't discussed the matter with them,' he replied. ' I should wish to know more of his Royal Highness's wishes and intentions.' Sturmer gnawed his lip. He saw that he had met his match, and that his prey was escaping from the net so elaborately prepared."], [65, "CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 55 ' All this is merely talking in the air,' he remarked, in the tone of a man who is tired of a conversation, and would like to change the subject. ' You must excuse me for reminding you, my dear Mr. Hervey, that you haven't yet told these gentlemen and myself how you stand in the matter. I hope I am not mistaken in reckoning you among our friends ? ' Hervey felt that his sense of honour would not allow him to equivocate with this direct challenge. ' I am sorry if I have to disappoint you,' he said, gravely, but calmly. ' But I confess that, in spite of all you have said, I look upon the Princess Victoria as the rightful heir to the throne. And even if I felt otherwise, still, as a loyal English man, loyal not merely to the reigning family, but to the laws of my country, I should give allegiance to the sovereign that Parliament put upon the throne.' ' And that is your answer ? ' demanded the German, into whose voice there had crept a threatening ring. 'Those are my sentiments as an officer and as a citizen,' said Teddy, rising to take his departure. ' And I hope, if the throne does become vacant, to be the first to cry \u2014 God Save the Queen ! '"], [66, "56 'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' CHAPTER VI the trap A subdued murmur of anger ran round the table as Hervey made his bold profession. But Baron Sturmer restrained it instantly, with a warning hand. ' Gentlemen, let us have no ill-feeling,' he said in smooth tones, which yet did not strike quite pleasantly on the lieu tenant's ear. ' Mr. Hervey is perfectly entitled to his own opinion, and we ought to be very much obliged to him for having spoken it so plainly.' As he said these words he gave a peculiar glance at Met calfe. The sandy-haired captain shrank slightly, and a sullen expression overcast his face. Immediately after he, too, rose, and the movement to depart became general. But the Hanoverian appeared to have other views with regard to Metcalfe. While bidding farewell to the others without opposition, he drew the captain aside, and said to him in a whisper : ' Wait. I have something I must say to you.' Rather reluctantly, as it seemed, the captain submitted, and allowed Hervey, De Vaux, and Ely to go off without him. As soon as the door had closed behind them, Sturmer drew his unwilling guest back into the dining-room, and made him sit down again, while he went to a sideboard and produced a bottle of brandy. ' I wanted to have a few words in quiet with you, Metcalfe,' he said, as he filled up two glasses. ' Try that cognac ; I think you'll find it better than anything they give you in the clubs.'"], [67, "THE TRAP 57 Metcalfe sipped the liquor in silence, regarding his host with an uneasy look. ' I am glad you were here this evening,' pursued the Baron, ' because you have beerrable to see for yourself what sort of a young fellow that is. You have heard me do my best to per suade him to join us, and you have heard his reply. Now what do you think of it ? ' ' I think it is just as well that he doesn't know any more.' Sturmer snapped his teeth together with a certain malicious triumph. ' Ah, that is what I expected you to say ! Unfortunately for us, though, Mr. Hervey does know something more \u2014 knows a good deal too much, in fact.' Metcalfe returned a look of dismay to this unpleasant announcement. The Hanoverian proceeded to explain. ' By a most unfortunate accident, which I don't see, even now, that I could possibly have reckoned with, he overheard last night a very compromising discussion between Lord London derry and me.' Sturmer briefly recounted the circum stances, and added, 'I don't recollect exactly what passed between us, but I am sure that enough was said to enable a shrewd man to make a very good guess at what was going on.' The captain nodded, with a face which reflected the other's anxiety. ' He is under a pledge not to say anything about what he heard, and I am pretty confident that he has not done so up to the present. I have had his movements watched. But after what has passed to-night, one can't feel sure what he may not do. He knows too much for one who is not with us. You understand ? ' The captain's florid face began to lose some of its colour, as he fidgetted uneasily in his chair, and tried to avoid the Baron's eye. ' It is unfortunate,' he muttered. ' Still, Hervey is a perfectly honourable young fellow. He is not likely to break his word.' The other shrugged his shoulders. ' Perhaps not, but remember that he is under no pledge as"], [68, "58 'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!\" to what has passed this evening. What is there to prevent him from putting two and two together, and giving a warning that will put others on their guard ? It's no use, my friend. We must secure ourselves.' A slight shiver ran through the listener's frame. ' You don't mean ? ' he faltered, in a husky whisper. Sturmer smiled with cold contempt. ' I take it that you know very well what I mean, my good Metcalfe.' ' No ! Don't ask me ! Remember young Vyvyan, only last year. It is De Vaux's turn this time.' 'You pay the penalty of your superior skill, my friend,' retorted the Hanoverian dryly. ' By the bye, I forgot to mention that I propose to-morrow instructing Coutts to honour your draft on me for the amount you named the other day, 500/.' The captain's eyes glistened. For a minute he remained silent, with the German watching him, while the working of his face betrayed the struggle that was going on in his mind. At length he looked up, deadly pale, but with a hard, set line round his mouth. 'You are right,' he said; 'he does know too much.' Sturmer nodded. He drew his chair nearer Metcalfe's, and the two engaged in a whispered conversation which kept them till a late hour. On leaving the Baron's house, the other three officers had walked back together to barracks. There they separated amicably, and Hervey, feeling the need of a wise friend's counsel, made his way to Major Campbell's quarters ; but Campbell was not there, and twenty-four hours were to elapse before Teddy had an opportunity of consulting with him. This unfortunate delay was due to Campbell's absorption in the inquiry with which he had been entrusted by Lord Hill. Determined to sift the matter to the very bottom, the Major had gone to work systematically. Partly from his own"], [69, "THE TRAP 59 memory, partly from information elicited from others in the course of casual conversations, he managed to compile a pretty full list of the duels in all the regiments of the Household Brigade during the last two or three years, with the names of the principals and seconds engaged in each. Where it was possible he looked up the seconds personally, and drew them on to talk of the affairs in which they had taken part. In some cases he experienced no difficulty in doing this ; in others he encountered a strange reserve. On the night of the second day after he had received his commission, he sat in his room studying the notes which he had put together so far. The result of this study seemed to be at once alarming and disconcerting. A heavy frown sat on the Scotchman's brow, as he glanced again and again at certain of the pages spread out on the table before him. ' What are the suspicious facts in all this, and what do they point to ? ' he muttered to himself. ' Certain names occur rather too frequently, to begin with. In July 1835 there is a duel, in which Bourchier kills his man ; Metcalfe is his second. In February 1836 Metcalfe is the principal, and Bourchier is the second j De Vaux is the second of the man who is killed, young Vyvyan. In April De Vaux kills Mordaunt, with Bourchier as his second. In October Metcalfe goes out with Strong, but fails to kill him. De Vaux is Strong's second, and Ely is Metcalfe's. Four duels, three of them fatal, in which the same set of men are concerned ! ' He shook his head gloomily, as he continued : ' What does it all mean ? How are these duels connected ? In each case, according to the story of the survivors, the dead man was the challenger. Strong, whom they failed to kill, admits that he challenged Metcalfe, during a game of cards, and blames himself for having lost his temper. Singular ! Mordaunt's second tells almost exactly the same story, but says that De Vaux rejected all attempts at a friendly settlement. All I can find out about Vyvyan is that he and the others were all dining together at that fellow Sturmer's house the night before. I wonder how much turns on that.' While he was still pondering over the ugly problem that"], [70, "GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 60 confronted him, he heard a knock outside. He went to the outer door, and found Hervey there, breathless, pale, and dishevelled. 1 Campbell,' he cried, as soon as the door was opened, ' I have come to ask you to act for me. I have insulted Metcalfe, and he insists on fighting.' ' My God ! ' The Scotchman's habitual reserve broke down before the shock of this frightful intelligence, coming, as it did, on the very heels of the sinister statistics he had just been studying. Teddy failed to understand his friend's consternation. 'Why, what's the matter, Campbell?' he demanded, advancing into the room, and throwing himself heavily into a chair. ' You look as if you had never heard of such a thing as an affair of honour before.' Campbell hesitated. Ought he to warn the young man of the dark suspicions which attached in his mind to the name of his adversary ? It seemed to him that the answer must depend on the position in which Hervey stood. If it were possible to avert this meeting, well and good ; if not, it would merely serve to upset the young man and destroy his nerve, to explain to him the character of his adversary. 'Tell me the whole story, Teddy,' he said, seating himself by the other's side. ' Don't leave out anything.' Teddy looked at him, surprised and a little touched. It was the first time the elder man had ever called him by his Christian name. The story which the lieutenant proceeded to tell, in a rather confused way, was briefly this. That evening, as they were coming out together, after mess, Metcalfe had invited him round to his rooms for a game of cards. At first Teddy was disposed to excuse himself, but the other was so pressing that he finally consented. Almost as soon as they got to the captain's quarters they were joined there by De Vaux and Viscount Ely, who offered themselves for a game of whist. Spirits were produced, and the four settled down to what seemed likely to be a convivial evening."], [71, "THE TRAP 61 Before long the chances of the game made Metcalfe and Hervey partners. Up to this time the captain had been playing rather well, but now a great change came over him. He hesitated over each card, led from weak suits, finessed in the wrong place, and neglected to trump when his doing so would have given the partners an easy victory. Hervey began to get impatient. ' What's the matter with you, Metcalfe ? ' he said at last rather sharply, as the other exposed a card in what seemed to be sheer carelessness. ' If you are tired of the game, say so. You can play well enough when you like.' Metcalfe instantly fired up. ' I am playing quite as well as you,' he replied with warmth. ' I have made no mistakes.' ' Nonsense ! ' returned Teddy ; ' you have made nothing but mistakes the last two hands.' ' I deny it. I have played whist a great deal longer than you have, and I'm not in need of your instruction.' Here the other two interposed to urge silence, and the game proceeded. But the captain's play grew worse and worse, till on the fourth trick he made a glaring revoke. Hervey brought his fist down on the table with a crash. ' What's the matter ? ' demanded Metcalfe sourly. ' Matter ! Don't you see you have just revoked ? Do you call that playing whist, I should like to know ? That just loses us the game and rub ! ' His partner stared at him in anger. ' How dare you say I revoked ? I did no such thing ! ' ' What ! ' cried Teddy, fairly beside himself, as was natural, at this monstrous denial. 'Do you know what you are doing? See here ! ' And he commenced to sort out the cards to prove the truth of his assertion. ' I say that I did not revoke ! ' shouted Metcalfe, getting up out of his chair, like a man who had thoroughly lost control of himself. ' And I say you did,' persisted Teddy, still annoyed at the"], [72, "62 ' GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ! ' loss of the game through what he considered^the inexcusable blunders of his partner. ' Very good, Mr. Hervey ; then you give me the lie before these gentlemen. I suppose you know what consequences that entails ? ' Teddy started back, astonished at this serious turn the captain had suddenly given to the dispute. He realised that he had been betrayed into the use of rather stronger language than he was aware of at the time, but yet it was difficult for him to qualify it in the face of such a threat. The other two players, who had appeared to be merely amused spectators of the first stages of the quarrel, now inter vened, as if in the interests of peace. ' Don't let this go any further, gentlemen, I beg of you,' said De Vaux. ' No doubt Hervey is willing to apologise for his mistake.' 'But what do you mean?' demanded the lieutenant, becoming exasperated again. ' Surely you know that I am right ? You must have seen the revoke yourself ! ' De Vaux shrugged his shoulders. * I confess I didn't notice it. If my friend Metcalfe says he didn't revoke, that settles it, so far as I am concerned. I am quite satisfied to take his assurance.' ' Oh, but I noticed it ! ' put in Ely, speaking for the first time. 'At least, I thought so,' he corrected himself, with an apologetic glance towards his host. But Metcalfe took no notice of the little ensign. ' I am waiting for Mr. Hervey's apology,' he said roughly, addressing himself to De Vaux. And then, taking out his watch, and laying it on the table, he added, with an insolent sneer, ' I give this gentleman two minutes to decide whether he will withdraw his insult, or make it good.' This tone, of course, left Hervey no alternative. Still be wildered by the unexpectedness with which a deadly quarrel had been sprung upon him, he rose slowly to his feet, and answered in a firm voice : ' I accept your challenge, Captain Metcalfe. I have nothing to withdraw.'"], [73, "THE TRAP 63 ' Then the sooner the affair is arranged, the better,' observed the captain coolly, as he restored his watch to his pocket. ' De Vaux, will you act for me in this business ? ' 'Certainly, my dear fellow, if it is absolutely necessary. But I still hope that Hervey will change his mind. He is a young man, and no doubt spoke without proper consideration.' This speech, instead of allaying Teddy's irritation, naturally increased it. ' I have said all I intend to say,' he returned shortly. ' I will send my friend to you in half an hour.' ' Perhaps you will let me offer you my services,' put in Ely, with a certain eagerness. Teddy was on the point of closing with this suggestion, when he caught a look of expectancy in the eyes of his enemy. He drew back instinctively. ' I am very much obliged to you,' he said to the viscount, 1 but I hardly feel justified in involving you in this affair. In so serious a matter, I think I should prefer to ask an old and intimate friend to act for me. I shall not keep you waiting long, gentlemen.' With these words, and a grave salute to the company, Teddy quitted the room, and hastened straight to his friend's quarters. Campbell listened to the story in silence, his brow growing darker and darker as it proceeded. ' The Methodists are right ! ' he exclaimed, when it was ended. ' The whole practice of duelling ought to be abolished. It has become a scandal. Surely it cannot long survive after this.' Teddy looked at him inquiringly, ignorant of what was in his friend's mind. Presently Campbell asked : ' Have you seen Baron Sturmer since the night before last?' 1 Why, yes, I dined with him last night, and came round here afterwards to tell you about it ; but you were out. Met calfe and the others were there.' 'Ah !' Campbell could not restrain the exclamation which burst"], [74, "64 \u2022GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' from his lips at this significant fact. The expression of his face served as a spark to the train of suspicions which had been accumulating in Teddy's brain. 'Good heavens!' he gasped. 'Do you think \u2014 is it possible \u2014 that this is the result of ' ' Of your adventure in the Throne Room? I'm afraid so,' answered the Major, seeing that it was useless to equivocate. ' I think that Sturmer has set a trap, and that you have walked into it.' ' But the whole thing seemed so unpremeditated,' faltered the younger man. ' It was I who lost my temper first, as a matter of fact.' ' And how did you come to lose it, pray?' ' I have told you, because Metcalfe played so atrociously.' ' And have you ever known Metcalfe \u2014 one of the greatest authorities on whist in the regiment \u2014 play atrociously before ? ' Teddy was silent. The whole plot to which he had fallen a victim stood clear before him. He could only thank his stars that he had not accepted that insidious proposal of the little viscount to become his second. The Major proceeded : ' However, it is idle to discuss that now. They have suc ceeded in their object, and put you in a position from which you cannot well retreat. I must do the best I can for you. Where shall I find De Vaux? ' ' I left him in Metcalfe's quarters.' ' Good, I will go round there. Wait here till I come back, and then we can consider what is best to do.' He hastened away, leaving the young lieutenant to pace the room impatiently, and curse the hastiness of temper which had led him to walk so blindly into the snares of his enemies. To do him justice, there was no mingling of personal fear in the young fellow's agitation. He was wrathful at being out witted, and resentful at having to face an antagonist whose motives reduced him to the level of an assassin. But his only fears were those aroused by the political bearing of the whole business. If it were worth Sturmer's while to have him murdered, then the knowledge he had accidentally acquired"], [75, "THE TRAP 65 must be far more important than he had dreamed. He must be standing on the threshold of some real and dangerous con spiracy, directed, he could not doubt, against his sweetheart's fair young mistress, the Princess of a people's hope, the future Queen, to whom he had pledged his service like a knight errant of the olden time. F"], [76, "' GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ! ; 66 CHAPTER VII THE ORANGE PLOT At the end of twenty minutes Major Campbell returned. 'I have settled everything,' he said briefly. 'Of course De Vaux claimed that they were entitled to the choice of weapons. He says that you gave his man the lie direct.' ' No, no ! ' protested Teddy. ' Well, it is no use arguing it. It is the old fable of the wolf and the lamb. Whatever you say is a fresh contradiction and therefore a fresh insult. They choose pistols ; and we are to meet in Battersea Fields to-morrow morning at seven.' ' To-morrow morning ! ' ejaculated Teddy, with a long face. ' Yes. I couldn't have asked them to wait longer.' ' Longer \u2014 no, I should think not ! But why not to-night ? ' ' Because there is other work for us to do to-night. I want you to come down with me to the Houses of Parliament.' Teddy opened his eyes. ' What is that for ? ' ' I will tell you that presently. I want to know first what happened at Sturmer's house last night.' ' Ah, I forgot I hadn't told you that. I see now that it was a deliberate attempt to sound me. You told me that Sturmer was trying to secure me on his side, and you were right.' Teddy related the substance of what had passed at the Baron's table. He noticed that, though his friend listened attentively, he did not show much surprise. 'It is as I suspected,' Campbell remarked at the end. 'The Orange plot is still in full swing.' ' What plot is that ? '"], [77, "THE ORANGE PLOT 67 'I thought you hadn't heard of it. I suppose you had hardly begun to understand anything about politics a year ago; and, besides, the affair was hushed up as far as possible. Still, it was the subject of proceedings in Parliament, so that it may be said to have become public property.' ' Explain what you mean. This is quite new to me,' said Teddy eagerly. ' Well, I dare say you have heard mention of the Orange Society. I don't quite know how it originated, but any way it seems to have been a secret society, and to have started in Ireland, the home of secret societies. It first came into prominence eight or ten years ago, in connection with Catholic Emancipation. It was an ultra-Protestant organisation, and later on it became ultra-Tory. Your people are Tories, I know,' added Campbell, deprecatingly, ' and mine are Whigs ; but you mustn't think I am prejudiced on that account.' ' My dear fellow ! ' cried Teddy, with indignation, ' I never dreamed of thinking such a thing. I don't like your Govern ment, but this isn't a question of Governments ; it- is a question of loyalty or disloyalty. Tory or no Tory, I stand by the rights of the Princess Victoria, and so I believe will every honest man on both sides.' Campbell held out his hand, and the two friends exchanged a grip that meant more than a dozen oaths. ' We understand each other. Let me go on with what I was saying. The Duke of Cumberland was chosen Grand Master of the Orange order, and all his friends went into it with him. Londonderry, I believe, was at the head of the Irish lodges, and Lord Kenyon was Deputy Grand Master ; and there were Lord Chandos, the Duke of Buckingham's son, and Wynford, and a lot more. The Bishop of Salisbury was prelate of the order. In fact, the whole thing was very formi dable. They worked it quietly at first, spreading lodges all over the country, particularly in the army ; and they got hold of a lot of magistrates and men in official positions. There were even lodges formed in the colonies at last. Your friend Sturmer, I think, went over to Canada, r_nd organised a strong branch of the society there.1 F2"], [78, "\u2022GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 68 Teddy listened, deeply interested. It was the first he had heard of a matter which bore so closely on his own dis coveries. ' I, as a Whig, was naturally left out, but more than half our fellows were in the order.' 'Ah I' The exclamation burst from Teddy, as he suddenly began to connect these disclosures with the references made to the officers of the Guards by Sturmer and Lord Londonderry in their secret conversation. Campbell gave him an inquiring look, as he went on : ' Finally, the Radicals got wind of what was going on, and took the alarm. Whether the Government inspired it, or not, I have never been able to tell, but an attack was made on the order in the House of Commons. Hume brought in resolu tions for the removal of the magistrates who were members of the order, and Lord John Russell carried an address to the King, calling for the suppression of all oath-bound societies. O'Connell talked about raising an army of loyal Catholics, and, in short, matters went so far that there were even rumours of an impeachment.' ' An impeachment ? ' ' Yes, of the Duke of Cumberland. It ended in his declar ing in his place in the House of Lords that he had dissolved the order.' 'But why? There must have been something more than that ? ' Campbell shrugged his shoulders. ' I have told you all that was ever publicly known. Lord Londonderry made a declaration that the objects of the society were perfectly innocent, and the Prince said the same thing. But there is no doubt that the suspicion among those who attacked it was that the real purpose for which the order existed was to promote the candidature of the Duke of Cum berland to the throne.' Two days before Teddy would have laughed at this idea as unworthy of being taken seriously. But after the argu ments he had heard from Sturmer, arguments which made an"], [79, "THE ORANGE PLOT 69 impression on him in spite of himself, he no longer felt any doubt that such a project as Campbell spoke of really existed. The question was, what were its chances of success. ' And do you believe that the Duke still holds to the idea ? ' he asked. 'I do. And I believe that his supporters are more numerous than any one suspects. In my opinion the pre tended dissolution of the Orange lodges was merely a blind, and the members of the order are still keeping together. Depend upon it, we are treading on the very edge of a dangerous conspiracy, all the more dangerous because its very existence is unsuspected by the persons chiefly threatened by it.' ' But what do you think they expect to do ? Surely the nation would never allow the Princess to be set aside ? ' ' What do you mean by the nation ? The Reformers would not allow it, if they could help, because they are look ing forward to doing as they please with the young Queen. But the other party, the patty of Tory noble families who have been ruling the country for the last fifty years, do you think they would hesitate to change the succession, if they thought that by so doing they could crush the democratic movement?' Teddy hung his head. As a member of one of the families referred to by his friend, he felt the reproach personally. 'Well,' he said, ' I am only one young man, but I will do what I can to show that we are not all traitors. I will go with you to see Melbourne, and tell him everything.' ' Right.' The two friends rose, and, going out from the barracks arm in arm, walked at a sharp pace in the direction of Westminster. The streets through which they had to pass were many of them such as would now be considered a disgrace to the metropolis. Ill-paved and worse-lighted, they were haunted by gangs of drunken rowdies, whom the few scattered watch men were quite unable to cope with. Some of these gangs consisted of gentlemen \u2014 that is to say, men of good family, with university degrees, and fashionably dressed ; and they"], [80, "' GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ! 70 were rather rougher than the others. Free fights were taking place at two points on the route followed by the friends. At every corner in the poorer neighbourhoods through which they passed stood flaring gin-palaces, in and out of which inebriates reeled all night long. The two exchanged looks of disgust as they came past one of these haunts, from which a pair of tipsy females were just staggering. Campbell spoke. ' How is it that in this age of enlightenment, with all our boasted discoveries and improvements, nothing is done to purify our streets, and to elevate the lives of these miserable creatures ? ' ' Why, what would you have done ? ' the younger man asked lightly. ' You can't prevent people getting drunk.' ' I am not so sure of that,' was the serious response. ' A good deal might be done, in my opinion, if not to prevent drunkenness, at all events to render it less easy. For instance, these places might be compelled to close their doors at a fixed hour every night, and their proprietors forbidden to furnish drink to persons already intoxicated.' Teddy fairly turned round and stared at his companion, to see if he were joking. ' What strange ideas you have, Campbell ! Do you expect to revolutionise society ? ' The elder man answered seriously, 'Yes, Teddy, I do expect it. Not all at once, perhaps, but by degrees. I will tell you why I, in common with many others, look forward with so much hope to the accession of the Princess Alexandrina. We believe that with her there will commence a new and a better era. This age of drunkenness and coarseness, of flaunting immorality and cynical indifference to religion and virtue, has almost run out its course. With a new sovereign on the throne, a high-minded, delicate young woman, reared under the noblest influences, what may not we expect ? I, for one, hope to witness a great and wholesome change. I believe the nation is going to turn over a new leaf, and that the example of a pure and honourable Court, radiating through every rank and class, will so transform society that our sons will look back"], [81, "THE ORANGE PLOT 71 with wonder and disgust at the public and private depravity which you and I have grown up to regard as the natural order of things.' Subdued by the peril which hung over him, Teddy was in the mood to listen to this discourse more seriously than he might have done at another time. For the first time it came home to him that he was indeed taking part in an historical crisis, and that something more than a mere question of per sonal rights was at stake in the secret contest for the crown. Each absorbed in his own reflections, the pair went on in silence till they saw before them the Palace of Westminster, or what was now left of that famous pile. Some of the blackened ruins of the part burnt down a year or two before still encum bered the ground on one side of the venerable hall of Rufus. On the other side the great hall was nearly concealed from view by a line of small law courts which had, as it were, sprouted out of its western wall. No progress had as yet been made with the structure destined to replace Saint Stephen's Chapel, and during this interim the burnt-out Commons had found a temporary home in the old chamber of the Lords, which had been hastily fitted up for their accommodation. The Peers themselves, ejected from their own territory, gathered in the Painted Chamber. As they came along, the two officers saw, by the darkness of that part of the building, that the members of the Upper House had dispersed for the night. But the glare of light next door showed that the Commons were still in full session, undeterred by closure or twelve o'clock rules, or other terrors of a later age. ' Lord Melbourne may be still here, in his private room,' remarked Campbell. ' Let us go in and ask.' They passed inside the building, where one of the door keepers went and found out for them that the Prime Minister was engaged in his room, and would see them presently. They turned into a lobby to wait, and as they did so a tall, fine-looking man, carrying a red despatch-box in his hand, hastened past them towards Lord Melbourne's room. The"], [82, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 72 cheery smile on his face and the bold glance of his eye im pressed Teddy favourably, and made him ask : ' Do you know who that man is ? ' The Major nodded. 'That is the Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston.' Teddy looked interested. He had often heard of this well known figure in the politics of the day, though the gulf which divided society into two camps, Whig and Tory, had prevented his seeing him before. ' I believe he is an able man, but without much principle,' continued Campbell. ' He has been in office for twenty years, but yet they say he wields no real influence. People don't take him seriously, and the Radicals don't trust him because he was lukewarm over Reform. But he is a good debater, and has a great knowledge of the Continent. I shouldn't wonder if he came to something yet.' Just here a couple drew in sight who were strangely con trasted in appearance. One was a bluff, hearty-looking man, whose strong point seemed to be rather sincerity than shrewd ness. He was plainly dressed, in a costume that carried with it an almost imperceptible flavour of Newmarket. Recognising the Major as he came up, he stopped and said : ' Hullo, Campbell, what are you doing here ? ' 'Waiting to see Melbourne on sone business,' was the answer. ' But don't you know my comrade ? \u2014 the Honourable Edward Hervey ; Lord George Bentinck.' ' Glad to make your acquaintance,' said Lord George, giving the lieutenant a thorough-going squeeze of the hand. ' Hope you're not a d d Whig like our friend here, eh ? ' ' No, my lord,' returned Teddy with a smile. ' I am a true-blue Tory \u2014 a loyal one,' he added with significant emphasis. ' Ah, but that is so commonplace ! It is the seditious Tory who is truly refreshing.' Teddy turned round. The words came from Lord George Bentinck's companion. This person, who now lounged for ward into the circle, was in every respect the antithesis of Lord George himself. He' was a young man of thirty or thereabouts,"], [83, "THE ORANGE PLOT 73 slender in figure, and possessing a well-shaped head, set off with a mass of luxuriant black ringlets, which glistened with the oil of Macassar. The sallowness of his complexion gave him a distinctly foreign look, enhanced by his Oriental cast of features. A pair of full black eyes sparkled with the keen fire of vivacity and intelligence, making an odd contrast with the languid pose of his figure. His dress was elaborate and affected, its most prominent feature being a waistcoat of many colours, crossed and recrossed by a perfect network of gold chain. Half-a-dozen rings glittered on his fingers, which he thrust from time to time through his hair, as if to show off the gems to the best advantage. His walk was an affected drag, his accent an affected drawl. ' Let me introduce my friend,' said Lord George Bentinck ; ' Mr. D'lsraeli.' The two officers bowed, Hervey with no feeling but simple curiosity as to who the stranger might be, Campbell with a dry smile provoked by his recollections of the novelist's career. ' I see you are in the House, if you are not yet of it, Mr. D'lsraeli,' said the Major, with a malicious reference to the other's recent candidature. D'lsraeli raised his eyelids, apparently with an effort, in order to perceive the person who had addressed him. ' On the contrary,' he replied in a slow voice, ' I am not yet in the House, but I have been of it all along. I became a politician in childhood. I recognise politics as the only pur suit which is equally interesting at every age. The only restriction which I impose on myself is that I shall not become Prime Minister too young, lest I should become blase in my old age.' Campbell recoiled, aghast at the audacity of the man. Teddy, on the contrary, was delighted. ' I see you are an original, sir,' he remarked. 'You are correct in your supposition, Mr. Hervey,' was the reply, ' though you appear to base it on insufficient grounds. There is nothing original in being Prime Minister \u2014 most of the holders of the office are very ordinary men. My claim to"], [84, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 74 originality rests on the means I take to attain my object. I, as my friends will tell you, am by nature a revolutionist. In more commonplace language, I am a Radical.' ' No, no, D'lsraeli ! ' his friend broke in. ' You are one of us now.' ' Exactly, my dear Bentinck, because I have recognised that Tory and Radical are in reality the same.' ' How do you make that out ? ' asked Campbell. * It is difficult to explain my position in a sentence. But one thing we have in common is a just hatred for the Whigs.' ' Thank you, sir,' growled the Major savagely. ' In politics,' pursued D'lsraeli calmly, ignoring the other's irritation, 'there is nothing really true but paradox. The Tories are the enemies of reform, therefore it follows that they make the best reformers. My forte is sedition ; I shall therefore find my true sphere among an hereditary aristocracy.' ' There, that will do, D'lsraeli,' interrupted Lord George, who seemed to regard his companion with a sort of good humoured tolerance, tempered by a nervous fear of what he might do next, like a staid uncle with a mischievous nephew whom he is taking out for the day. ' Campbell will think you are serious \u2014 remember he is a Scotchman.' 'Ah, you Scotchmen are terrible fellows,' murmured D'lsraeli. ' I confess that the one nation I do not understand are the Scotch. There is that man Gladstone, for instance ; if he only had a sense of humour he would be a really great man.' ' Who is Mr. Gladstone ? ' asked Teddy. Bentinck took it on himself to answer. ' An excellent fellow,' he said with warmth. ' If he would only interest himself a little more in the sports of country gentlemen, come to Newmarket occasionally, and ride to hounds, I should have very great hopes of him. But that is the worst of town-bred men. Gladstone is a very clever man, and a staunch Tory, but he will never make a popular states man.' Here Teddy ventured to make a suggestion."], [85, "THE ORANGE PLOT 75 * Can we go into the House, and watch the debate for a little while, while we are waiting for Lord Melbourne ? ' 'By all means,' replied Bentinck. 'I will take you in myself.' ' I will say good night, then,' observed Mr. D'lsraeli. ' I never enjoy listening to any speeches except my own.' And with this parting shot he went off, leaving Teddy charmed, Campbell disgusted, and Bentinck slightly re lieved. . He talks like a fool,' explained the worthy Lord George confidentially, ' but he is monstrously clever underneath it. And when you come to know him he has got an awfully good heart.' They made their way into a little space outside the Bar of the House, where strangers were allowed to stand, and Bentinck pointed out some of the celebrities present to the interested lieutenant. ' That little fellow sitting on the Speaker's right, with a nose like a broken corkscrew, is Lord John, the leader of the House. He is a regular little gamecock when he gets on his legs. I wish you could hear him. That man next him is Spring-Rice ; they say he is to have a peerage.' Teddy looked round the House for the man whose renown as a speaker at that time cast nearly every one of his con temporaries into the shade. ' Where is O'Connell ? ' he inquired. ' There, on the right, sitting behind Ministers. They are great friends just now.' Teddy looked, and beheld the burly figure of the great Irish tribune, as he leant forward to whisper something into the ear of Lord John Russell. His face, broad and wrinkled, with its small and insignificant features, gave no index to the abilities of the man, and Teddy turned away rather disappointed. ' He doesn't look like an orator,' he observed in a whisper. 1 Ah, wait till you hear him speak,' replied Campbell. ' The scoundrel ! If I had my way he should have no chance to speak, except within four stone walls,' commented"], [86, "76 'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' Lord George Bentinck. ' The man is a dangerous rebel, who ought to be expelled the House.' Just at that moment the member who was on his legs made a disparaging reference to Ireland. Instantly Hervey saw a change come over the face of O'Connell. He leant back in his seat, settled his huge hat over his eyes, and a deep flush slowly overspread his features ; his lips worked convulsively, and he seemed to be burying the nails of his fingers into the palms of his clenched hands. The speaker went on. He began to denounce what he described as a traitorous agitation. He alluded to a certain personage, by whom O'Connell was clearly intended, in bitter and abusive terms, as the perverter of his countrymen, the enemy of his sovereign, and the servant of nothing but his own personal greed. The House turned to the assailed man with angry looks which pointed every sentence. O'Connell drew his hat yet further down on his brow, and a fierce light began to shine in his half-closed eyes. At last the speaker sat down. Two or three other men of no note rose at the same time to catch the Speaker's eye. But the House would not listen to them. Shouts of ' O'Connell,' and 'Answer, answer,' shook the building. The would-be speakers reluctantly sat down, and the great Irishman slowly rose up, towering amid the benches. He began gently, with an affectation of timidity that hugely tickled the House. Presently he referred to the mem ber who had just attacked him, at first in a tone of broad humour that set the crowded benches in a roar. The un happy victim of the jokes cowered in his seat, and looked as if he rather regretted his provocation. Then, with a sudden turn, the orator became satirical. He launched sarcasm after sarcasm at his now writhing opponent, sarcasms which were at first received in dead silence, but which gradually called forth the groans and interruptions of the victim's friends, quickly responded to by the ringing cheers of the body of Irishmen who sat opposite. These groans and cheers were evidently what O'Connell needed. All at once, without the"], [87, "THE ORANGE PLOT 77 smallest warning, dropping his tone of irony like a sheath from the blade, he burst out into a torrent of loud passionate invective that fairly cowed the benches. The groans died away, the man attacked was forgotten, and urged on by the general applause of his side of the House, the swelling figure stormed and raged like a tempest over the devoted heads of his enemies. Suddenly, at the close of the fiercest period of all, his voice seemed to die away. He stood for a moment as if hesitating. The House looked up, anxious and expectant. Then he resumed his speech, but in so different a tone that it no longer appeared to come from the same man. He spoke of Ireland, of the land of the green valley and the rushing river. He touched on its people, he described them in tender language, he dealt with their peculiar traits, their ancient and sad history. He called up before the rapt attentive House a picture of an Irish cabin, standing on the bleak wind-swept hillside, built of rough stones, the interstices stuffed with mud and straw. He painted the inmates gathered round their smouldering turf fire, eating the scanty food which was spared to them by the taxgatherer of an absentee lord. All was alive, real. You saw the father, his back bowed with labour, the mother, thin and old before her time, the children with wan pinched faces, huddled together for the warmth which their scanty rags could not give them. And the House listened, hanging on every syllable, with dim eyes, and every now and then a choking sound betrayed the emotion that would not be suppressed. ' And that,' wound up the speaker simply, ' is what has made me what the honourable member calls a traitor.' O'Connell sat down ; and while the frantic cheers were sounding and resounding from floor to ceiling, Teddy turned to his companions and saw Campbell's lip on the tremble, while a tear actually glittered in the eye of Lord George Bentinck. The next moment the Speaker put the question, and a division was called for. Lord George sprang to his feet. ' Where are you going ? ' said Teddy."], [88, "78 'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 'I'm going to vote against that scoundrel O'Connell,' was the answer. ' But he does know how to speak, doesn't he ? ' At the same time a messenger approached Campbell. ' Lord Melbourne is ready to receive you now, gentlemen.' And the two friends, bidding Lord George good night, went to see the head of the British Government."], [89, "79 CHAPTER VIII AN AFFAIR OF HONOUR A man between fifty and sixty, well made, and well dressed, with an open kindly face, decently subdued into an expres sion of well-bred boredom, was half sitting, half reclining on a sofa, languidly turning over the leaves of a book with one hand, while he caressed a poodle on his knee with the other. On a table near him stood a vase of flowers, a couple of wine decanters and glasses, and a richly ornamented snuff box, which appeared to be there rather for show than for use. Two or three novels and a pocket volume of Horace in the Latin were scattered on chairs round the room. The mantel piece was laden with all kinds of trifles, from hideous China dragons to crumpled billets-doux. On the edge of a side board near the door, apparently tossed down with such care less haste that it was nearly falling on the floor, was a flat box covered with crimson leather, of the kind used to contain the most important State documents. Such was the spectacle which presented itself to Teddy as he was ushered, with his friend Campbell, into the presence of William Lamb, Viscount Melbourne, the fashionable Prime Minister, who pretended that he merely dabbled in politics, as he had dabbled in literature when he wrote his comedy, and who studiously preserved the air of a dandy who was rather bored t>y having to govern the United Kingdom. Hervey's spirits sank within him at the sight. Surely it was not a man of this kind who could be trusted to grapple with and crush the dangerous conspiracy which seemed to be gathering head in the darkness?"], [90, "80 'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' Lord Melbourne stood up to receive the two officers, and then languidly dropped into his seat again, inviting them by a gesture to follow his example. 'Well, gentlemen, I hear you have some business with me. Be good enough to tell me what I can do for you.' And the Premier half closed his eyes, and put on an air of resignation as he prepared himself to listen. Campbell took on himself the burden of explanation. ' We have ventured to wait on your lordship to commu nicate a very grave discovery, or rather a very grave suspicion, which we have formed in consequence of certain things that have happened to my friend, Lieutenant Hervey.' Lord Melbourne looked extremely bored. ' Are you sure that you have come to the right person ? ' he asked, with an undisguised ring of scepticism in his voice ; ' hadn't you better see the Secretary of State, or the police authorities ? ' ' My lord,' Campbell answered firmly, ' the matter I speak of immediately concerns the succession to the throne.' Even the easy-going Premier showed some signs of interest at this announcement. He sat up, and exclaimed : 'My goodness, gentlemen, I hope this isn't something more about the Orange plot ? ' ' I am afraid it is something of the kind,' was Campbell's answer. ' But perhaps you will let me tell your lordship what it is that has alarmed us.' And without giving Melbourne any further chance to refuse, the Major plunged into his statement, beginning with Hervey's adventure at the Duke of Cumberland's reception, and going on to Sturmer's attempt to corrupt the lieutenant, and the subsequent challenge. The Premier heard him out with exemplary patience. At the close of the narrative he elegantly stifled a yawn. 'My good sir, all this is wonderfully zealous of you \u2014 wonderfully zealous of you both; and I am sure you have shown the greatest acuteness and ability. But I think this is a matter for the Secretary of State. Yes, I really think I can leave this in the hands of Lord John Russell. He is a most"], [91, "1 AN AFFAIR OF HONOUR 81 energetic man, as I dare say you know ; far more competent to deal with these sort of things than I am.' 'Then your lordship doesn't attach importance to this conspiracy, I suppose,' observed Campbell, suppressing his wrath. ' To be quite frank with you, I don't. I never did quite be lieve in these mysterious plots. In my opinion the age of con spiracies is over. I have no doubt that some of the Duke of Cumberland's friends would like to see him on the throne, and some of the more extreme ones wouldn't shrink from violent measures to put him there. But, you know, gentle men, the idea is too monstrous to be taken seriously. I feel quite at ease about it, I assure you. Mayn't I offer you some refreshments before you go ? ' Campbell declined this offer with a silent bow, and rose from his seat. Teddy followed his example. 'I really advise you to try Lord John,' the Premier con cluded affably. ' I'm afraid I am rather incredulous. That sort of thing seems so out of date in the nineteenth century. But take care of yourself, Mr. Hervey, if you are really going out to-morrow. Look at your man's eyes, you know, not at his pistol. But there, I have no doubt you know as much about it as I do. Good evening, gentlemen.' The two officers came out from the interview, fuming with inward rage. 'That is the man who is in charge of the British empire ! ' growled the senior. ' It seems to me, Teddy, that we shall have to rely on our own wits to fight Baron Sturmer.' Teddy nodded, with a disheartened air. ' Let's go back,' he said. ' I am tired, and I want a few hours' sleep before I turn out to-morrow.' They walked back slowly, and parted at the door of the lieutenant's quarters, Campbell promising to come round and call for him in the morning. As soon as he was in his own room, Teddy lit the candles, and sat down to write two letters. Each of these, as soon as it was dry, he folded up with great care, so that it should be impossible for the most prying eye to peep at its contents, and G"], [92, "' GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ! ' 82 sealed it with the signet on his finger. This done, he super scribed one ' To the Viscountess Hervey,' and the other ' To the Lady Fanny Greville.' Then, quickly throwing off his outer things, the honest young fellow knelt down and said a short prayer, and got into the bed. For a time he lay with his eyes open, counting in the moon light the stripes on the window blind, and wondering whether he should ever see Fanny again. Then he closed his eyes and tried to recall the picture of her face as he had last seen it that very morning. But the outlines were too indistinct, and he found himself opening his eyes again, and watching a big brown moth as it blundered round the ceiling. He closed his eyes once more, and continued to trace the course of the moth round the room by the sound of its bumming wings ; and the sound grew fainter and fainter, and he had just given up the effort of listening to it, when he felt his arm seized, and woke up with a start to see Campbell standing over him, and the morning light pouring into the room. And with that light there poured in upon his mind the full consciousness of what he was about to do, and he knew that within an hour he must stand opposite the loaded weapon of a man who sought his life. He found himself trembling slightly, with a sort of nervous excitement, as he began to dress, and he was irritated with himself, lest Campbell should notice it, and put it down to fear. He began to talk loudly and at random, to hide his feelings, and made a jest of the two letters lying on the table where he had left them overnight. ' I must leave it to you to pay the postage on them, old fellow,' he said, pointing to them. ' I will deliver them myself, Teddy, if it should come to that,' answered his friend. Never was a June morning more bright and balmy than when the two crossed the river on their way to the marshy flats known as Battersea Fields. The brown sails of the barges, drifting up on the tide, silled in the picture of Chelsea reach, with its glorious spread of shining water, each wave tipped"], [93, "AN AFFAIR OF HONOUR 83 with sunlight. The dark red houses of Cheyne Walk, with the leafy elms in front, closed up the background on the right, as they looked up the river, while behind them the mist was just lifting above the distant towers of Westminster. Between them and the village of Battersea spread the Fields, a neglected waste, browsed over by donkeys, and haunted by passing gipsy caravans. They walked along in silence towards the spot appointed for the rendezvous, till they came in sight of a group of three men, Metcalfe, De Vaux, and a surgeon whom the others had brought with them. Then Teddy spoke suddenly. ' I shall aim at his legs,' he said \u2014 and the sound of his own voice sounded vague and unfamiliar to him. ' I don't think I could bear it if I were to kill him.' Campbell shrugged his shoulders, like one who feels that he has no right to remonstrate. ' I wish I could think he would have any such scruples,' was all he answered. Then he quickened his pace, and went on in front to meet De Vaux, who was advancing in their direction. They saluted politely, but neither side referred to the pos sibility of an accommodation, Campbell because he felt certain that it would be useless, De Vaux because he was there with a very different object. Each of the seconds had come prepared with a case of pistols. De Vaux pressed that the weapons brought by him should be the ones used. ' No,' said Campbell, ' I can't agree to that. You had the privilege of deciding that pistols should be the weapon, I claim the privilege of providing the pistols.' And he offered them for the other's examination. De Vaux was at first inclined to dispute the point. Finding his opponent firm, he suggested : ' Suppose we draw lots ? ' ' No,' repeated Campbell, sternly, looking De Vaux in the eyes ; ' either you consent to use my pistols, or I refuse to let my principal go on. /will answer to you, if you consider my decision improper.' G 2"], [94, "' GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ! ' 84 The other man quailed, and gave way, muttering something about extraordinary behaviour, which the Scotchman disdained to notice. The weapons were loaded in silence, and the two princi pals placed opposite each other, at a distance of twelve paces. Meanwhile Captain De Vaux raised a fresh point. Drawing Campbell to one side, he said : ' I consider that it is for me to give the word to fire.' The Major shook his head stubbornly. ' I regret that I cannot concede that point either,' he said, coldly. ' Sir ! ' exclaimed the irate De Vaux. ' Well ? ' ' Your attitude is not altogether pleasant. Do you mean anything by it, may I ask ? ' Campbell folded his arms, and gave the other a steady look, which he was unable to meet. ' I will give you any explanations you may desire, after wards. At present I confine myself to saying that unless you accept my terms, this affair shall not proceed further.' The other second bit his lip. Forcing himself to give a sullen consent, he stood aside, and allowed Campbell to give the signal. Now that the moment had actually come, Teddy found himself singularly free from nervousness. The very knowledge that the suspense was over at last seemed to have restored his tone. He stood up boldly, in the approved fashion of duellists when the weapon resorted to was the pistol \u2014 that is to say, with his heels together, sideways to his opponent, the head turned to the right, so as to face him, and the right arm held straight downwards, with the muzzle of the pistol pointing to the ground. Metcalfe had taken up a similar attitude. The idea, of course, was to present the smallest possible surface to the hostile bullet. It was now, for the first time, that the lieutenant took a good look at his opponent. The result served to encourage him. Metcalfe's face was flushed, as if he had been drinking"], [95, "'AN AFFAIR OF HONOUR 85 brandy, his eyes shrank from meeting his enemy's, and Hervey even fancied he could perceive a trembling in the other's pistol arm. ' Are you ready, gentlemen ? ' asked Major Campbell, taking out a white handkerchief, which he held up. There was no answer. Each man straightened himself up nervously, and tightened his clutch on his weapon. ' Fire ! ' The handkerchief fluttered slowly to the ground. Teddy lifted his arm steadily, till the pistol was pointing at Metcalfe's knee, and pulled the trigger. As he did so he felt a slight burning sensation on his left temple, as though some one had passed a hot iron rapidly across it. The next thing he was conscious of was the sight of his enemy staggering back, and falling with his right leg doubled up under him, while in the same moment, as it seemed, Campbell was heartily shaking him by the hand and saying : ' Well done, my boy ! I congratulate you ! By George, you had a narrow escape. The ball has left a black mark on your skin.' He shook himself like a man emerging from a trance. ' Well, is it all over ? ' he asked stupidly. ' I presume so.' Campbell turned to look. The surgeon had hurried up to examine the wound in Metcalfe's leg, and his second was bending over him. The wounded man's face had turned a ghastly white, but he had not lost consciousness. ' Is your principal satisfied ? ' As Campbell put the formal question, he took the still smoking pistol from his friend's hand. De Vaux whispered something in his comrade's ear, and received a nod in answer. He looked up at Campbell. 'No.' 'No!' The exclamation burst from the Major almost involuntarily. De Vaux repeated his answer, with a scowl. 'No.'"], [96, "[GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 86 ' You wish to go on ? ' ' We insist on going on.' 1 But your man cannot stand up.' 'He will fight kneeling.' ' Great heaven ! I never heard of such a proposal.' ' Have you any objection to make to it ? ' ' It is unprecedented. My principal cannot fire on a man who is unable to stand up.' ' That is our concern. Your man appears to be unhurt ; if so, we have the right to insist on another exchange of shots.' ' And you mean to insist ? ' ' We do insist.' Campbell turned to his friend with a face of dismay. ' This is horrible,' he muttered ; ' but I am afraid there is no help for it. They are entitled to go on as long as you are unhurt.' The sudden reaction was too much for the young man. He became oppressed with a dull feeling of nausea, and felt as if he should swoon. ' Very well,' he managed to say. ' But this time I shall fire in the air. I cannot aim at a man on the ground.' Campbell ground his teeth and swore beneath his breath ; but, as he had said, there was no help for it. The duelling code was clear. A man who had been wounded, while his adversary remained unhurt, could not be denied the privilege of a second shot. The weapons were reloaded, and the monstrous proceed ings went on. Metcalfe, with the aid of his second and the surgeon, took up a position facing Hervey, half kneeling, half crouching on the ground, supported partly by his unhurt knee and partly by his left hand, while the wounded leg was extended behind him. In this attitude he would be just able to bring his pistol to bear. Meanwhile Campbell went and picked up the handkerchief, which had been blown some way along the ground. Again he put the question, and, receiving no response, again gave the fatal signal. Dazed and shocked at the miserable turn the affair had"], [97, "AN AFFAIR OF HONOUR 87 taken, Teddy lifted his arm high above his adversary's head. In an instant, before he had time to sire, the pistol dropped from his nerveless grasp, he felt a sharp twitch in his side, and fell to the earth like a dead man. Lady Fanny Greville was getting restless. She drummed with her pink finger-tips on the window pane. ' He hasn't come ! He didn't come yesterday, and he is not coming to-day,' she repeated to herself. And she turned another anxious gaze out over Kensington Gardens. The clock of Kensington Church began to chime out the hour of noon. A number of smaller clocks inside the Palace followed suit. 1 He ought to have come again by now. He would have, if he really cared about me. Is anything wrong, I wonder ? ' She moved from the window of the room to the fireplace, and back again. ' There must be something wrong, or he would have come. Whatever can it be ? ' Disappointment began to give way to apprehension. Fanny gave a last despairing look out of the window, and saw some thing new in the prospect. A tall, well-dressed man, with the firm carriage of a soldier, was walking steadily across the grass towards the wicket-gate at the corner of the Palace. By passing through this gate the stranger would be enabled to do either of two things. He might pass on to the green in front of the Church. Or he might turn to the right and arrive at the entrance of the Palace. Unfortunately from where she stood it was impossible for Fanny to see what became of the man after he had reached the wicket. She watched him out of sight with a dim pre sentiment that his appearance was connected with herself. Five minutes elapsed. Fanny had finally retired from the window, and was trying to distract her mind with a species of fancy work much in vogue, known as netting. The object in view appeared to be the weaving of a net of coarse white thread or wool. A long"], [98, "88 'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' loop of string was attached to one foot, and from this founda tion, as from a stalk, radiated an ever-enlarging series of meshes, the reticulations of which were made by means of a steel weapon, resembling a needle, but in reality constructed on the principle of a shuttle, which the fair weaver caused to dart in and out with bewildering dexterity with one hand, while the other held a piece of flat bone by which the loops in process of formation were kept together. Thus engaged, the young lady of the period assumed somewhat the appear ance of a gigantic spider in the act of enveloping itself in its own web. A knock came at the door, and one of the servants entered with a card. Fanny took it, and read the name of Major Campbell. The bright colour came into her face, to be succeeded by a look of anxiety. She gave the necessary order for him to be shown up, and stood waiting his entrance with a beating heart. Campbell appeared, grave and subdued, with a certain tender pity in his manner of saluting her. For a moment they regarded each other in embarrassed silence. Then his first words told her everything. ' I have come to bring you bad news \u2014 very serious news. Lieutenant Hervey fought a duel this morning ; he was shot in the side, and we fear that he is in great danger.'"], [99, "89 CHAPTER IX A BULLET AND ITS BILLET On the following morning London had two items of interest to talk about. The first was the King's illness. The second was the duel between two officers of the Guards. It was now one or two weeks since the King had been laid up with what at first was thought to be nothing more than a slight affection of the chest. But as the days wore on, and he showed no signs of rallying, the public began to feel anxious. Finally the physicians commenced to issue bulletins, and everybody realised that William IV. was seriously ill. Still, no one yet anticipated any fatal issue. The King had been such a short time on the throne, only seven years, he had looked so strong and well when he last drove through the streets to open Parliament, that every one believed he was destined to reign for many years to come. It was only last month that the Princess Alexandrina Victoria had attained her legal majority, which had been fixed by Act of Parliament at eighteen years, and she had shown herself so little in public up to the present, that the nation knew little more of her than if she had been still in the nursery. The duel in Battersea Fields had attracted attention from the fact that these meetings were becoming less frequent in England than they had been a generation before. The interest was heightened by the report that both the com batants were wounded, one of them mortally. Paragraphs appeared in the newspapers, in which the parties were dis creetly indicated by their initials as Captain M and Lieutenant H . But the person on whom this event made the greatest"], [100, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 90 impression was the Commander of the Forces. No sooner did he learn what had occurred, and that Major Campbell, the very person whom he had deputed to investigate the causes of these duels, had acted as second on this occasion, than he wrote and despatched an imperative order, requiring the Major's attendance without an hour's delay. The messenger had scarcely left the precincts of the Horse Guards, when the Commander of the Forces was informed that Major Campbell had presented himself. The order for his admission was at once given, and no sooner did he enter than the peppery Lord Hill began to overwhelm him with reproaches. 1 Well, Mr. Campbell ! So you've come here ! Actually come here of your own accord ! Wonder what your ideas of duty are ? Do you call your conduct decent and becoming in an officer ? Two days ago, charged you with a special mission to inquire into causes of fatal duels ; next day you take part in one. I should like to know what you have to say for yourself, sir !' ' If your lordship will allow me to explain,' began Camp bell, nothing daunted by this attack. ' Certainly ! I allow every man to explain his conduct, if he can. But you won't find it easy to excuse this, let me tell you.' ' The mission which you entrusted me with two days ago was confidential. I suppose I may venture to take it that anything I may say to your lordship about this business will not be official ? ' insinuated the Major, with native caution. In spite of his choler, the Commander of the Forces recognised the fairness of this stipulation. He nodded shortly. ' Go on, sir. This interview is not official.' ' Thank you, sir. The duel which took place yesterday was between my most intimate friend, Lieutenant Hervey, a young fellow of twenty, and a Captain Metcalfe, an experienced duellist, who has already killed one man. The challenge was given by him, after an absolutely unimportant dispute at cards, in which he had provoked young Hervey into the use of strong"], [101, "A BULLET AND ITS BILLET 91 language. In my opinion the whole affair was deliberately planned beforehand, and I agreed to act for Hervey, because I was determined to save him from the possibility of foul play on the field.' ' Why didn't you stop the thing coming off? ' growled Lord Hill. ' Because I had no proofs, only suspicions, and if Hervey hadn't gone out, he would have been branded as a coward.' The Commander of the Forces frowned. As a soldier he could make no answer to this decisive plea. ' Well, sir, go on. Tell me your suspicions.' ' The day before this challenge, the two men had been dining with others at the house of a man whom your lordship has probably met, Baron Sturmer.' Lord Hill started slightly, and gave the speaker an inquiring look. ' In the course of the inquiries I had already made under your orders, I found that the last duel in which a man was killed by this Captain Metcalfe followed closely on a dinner at Stunner's, at which Metcalfe and his victim were both present.' 'Good God!' Lord Hill forgot his anger against Campbell in his horror at this intelligence. He grasped the arms of his chair and listened eagerly for more. ' It seemed to me that there must be some connection between these events, especially as Metcalfe and his second, Captain De Vaux, have figured, in one capacity or another, in a number of recent duels. I ascertained from Mr. Hervey what had passed at the dinner. It appears that the con versation consisted mainly of an attempt on the part of Baron Sturmer and the others to persuade Hervey to support the pretensions of the Duke of Cumberland to the British crown.' Lord Hill sprang from his seat with an oath. His first impulse was evidently to say something violent, but the next instant he checked himself by an effort, and began striding up and down the room."], [102, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!'\" 92 ' And you believe ? ' \u2014 he demanded, stopping in front of the Major, and fixing him with a troubled gaze. ' I believe that a party is being formed among the officers of the army in the Prince's favour, and that those whose opposition is considered dangerous are being deliberately killed out of the way.' The Commander of the Forces drew a deep breath, as he struggled to repress his emotions at this dreadful news. ' Politics again ! ' he muttered out between his clenched teeth. ' Always the curse of the army ! ' He stood silent for a time, and then resumed his uneasy walk up and down the room. ' Look here, sir,' he said presently, turning to Campbell, who had sat silently waiting, ' I won't be dragged into their infernal devil's cauldron ; I've seen too much of it. Look at the Duke ; after Waterloo, most popular man in England ; to day, most detested. Soldier has no business meddling with government. What matter to us whether we serve King or Queen, so long as we do our duty ? ' He threw out these sentences in a half angry, half depreca tory way, as though he felt himself to be partly on his defence before the younger officer. ' Must protect my officers, though,' he resumed presently. ' This captain \u2014 Metcalfe, d'ye call him ? \u2014 shall sell out. I shall issue new general order against duels, and break first man who disobeys.' Campbell listened with a sinking heart. Any hope he had allowed himself to cherish, that Lord Hill would take action against the conspiracy, forsook him. It was evident that, as he had said to Teddy the night before the duel, they must trust to themselves to fight the Hanoverian and his plots. And this comrade on whom he relied was now lying helpless on a sick bed from which he might never rise. The Commander of the Forces was now only anxious to terminate an interview which had brought him so much painful embarrassment. 'You will say nothing about this business outside?' he asked, as the Scotchman rose to take leave. ' I shall say nothing about the business you employed me"], [103, "A BULLET AND ITS BILLET 93 on, sir,' was the answer. ' But I shall consider myself free to do what I can, as a loyal citizen, to protect the rights of our future Queen.' With these bold words, he bowed himself out, and hastened back to his friend's sick-chamber. When Teddy first recovered consciousness, more than twenty-four hours after he had been brought back to his quarters, he thought at first that he was alone. But presently a gentle rustle caused him to turn his head, and he saw on the opposite side of the room a young woman in a black dress, with her head turned towards him, who was busily stirring up a posset of some kind on a little table. He watched her for full five minutes in a dreamy way, wondering what she was doing, and who she could be, before it occurred to him to ask. At the first sound of his voice the young woman started, and made a movement as if to turn round, which she instantly checked. Then he heard her say in a strained, indistinct voice : ' Hush ! You must lie still and not talk now.' Teddy felt a thrill go through him. He sprang up into a sitting posture, and cried out : ' Why, it's Fanny ! ' The young woman swiftly turned towards the bed. It was Fanny ! Half laughing, half crying, she ran to him, and pushing his head gently down on to the pillow, laid her own by its side. For some minutes neither spoke. The consciousness of each other's nearness was enough for them. But presently the curiosity of the invalid grew too strong for him, and he asked : ' How did you come to hear of it ? ' ' Don't ask me now. You are very ill, and the doctor has given strict orders that we are not to allow you to say a word.' ' I won't : I only want to listen to you. Tell me everything. Fanny hesitated, doubting whether she was not disobeying the orders of the doctor, but the imploring look in the young man's eyes was too much for her. ' Lie very still then, and I will tell you. Your friend Major"], [104, "' GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ! ' 94 Campbell came to me yesterday, and told me what had happened. Teddy ! I thought I should go distracted ! \u2014 No, keep still ! ' This rebuke was caused by a movement on the part of the patient, who had seized his nurse's hand, and was trying to press it to his lips. ' Mr. Campbell told me that they had tried to kill you because of what we had overheard that night in the Throne Room. And \u2014 and so I told him everything ! ' A look of reproach came on the face of the invalid. ' I hadn't given any promise not to,' said Fanny, in answer to the look. ' And if I had,' she added defiantly, ' I should have told him just the same, after what those wretches had done to you.' Teddy feebly shook his head. 'And after he had gone,' continued the unrepentant Fanny, ' I went to the Princess, and told her too. And she was so kind that I asked her to let me come here every day and nurse you, and she gave me leave. And here I am ! ' ' And your mother ? ' whispered the invalid. A more serious expression replaced the look of triumph on Fanny's countenance. ' She is not to know it,' she confided. ' The Princess has promised to keep it a secret from everybody. And I have come here every day in a frock of one of the housemaids, with a thick veil on. I couldn't bear to think of your lying here all alone, Teddy, with only some horrid old woman to look after you ! ' There was another demonstration on the part of the patient, checked as before by his nurse. ' The Princess made me tell her all about you, and how you were getting on, when I came back to the Palace yesterday. And when you recover, as soon as ever you are able to get out, her Royal Highness says that I am to present you to her, that she may thank you herself.' The effect of this intelligence on her patient was such as to make Fanny regret having said anything. He at once raised himself from the pillow, exclaiming :"], [105, "A BULLET AND ITS BILLET 95 ' That will be in a few days. I say, Fanny, can't you give me something to eat ? ' 'No, no! 'she cried in terror. 'You mustn't! The doctor says that you are very, very ill, and you are to lie still, and not move or speak till he gives you leave. And here is your medicine ; I ought to have given it to you three hours ago, but you seemed sleeping so beautifully that I couldn't bear to wake you up.' She crossed the room hurriedly, and returned with a tumbler containing a nauseous-looking draught. Teddy sniffed at it disdainfully. ' I'm not going to swallow that stuff,' he said decidedly. ' I feel a bit weak, but I'm not so ill as all that comes to.' ' But you must take it,' insisted his sweetheart. ' To please me, Teddy.' Before this appeal had time to take effect there was a dis creet knock outside, followed by the appearance of Major Campbell, and an elderly man of dignified bearing, whose quick, piercing glance seemed to instantly seize on the patient, and find out all about him. Campbell, who had met the stranger \"at the foot of the stairs on his return from the Horse Guards, said to Fanny : ' This is Sir Astley Cooper, who has kindly offered to see Mr. Hervey.' At the name of the celebrated surgeon a glow of joy rose to Fanny's cheeks. She curtseyed deeply, before taking Sir Astley's hand. 'You mustn't say I offered my services,' corrected the great man good-naturedly. ' The fact is that I was requested to come here by a certain illustrious patient of mine, who fortu nately never has to call me in for herself.' Overcome by this proof of the thoughtful goodness of the young Princess, the other three could only murmur their gratitude. Sir Astley Cooper advanced to the bedside. ' Well, my young friend, you hardly look like a dying man. Who's been attending you ? ' Major Campbell answered the question, giving the name of"], [106, "96 'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN! the surgeon who had been present when Hervey was shot, and who had continued in charge of the case. ' I don't feel like a dying man,' Teddy added on his own account, ' but the doctor seems to have been frightening them all, and saying I'm to keep still, and do nothing, and drink all sorts of beastly messes.' And he pointed in scorn at the medicine which Fanny had just been pressing upon him. Sir .Astley quickly took up the tumbler, and smelt its contents. As he did so his brows contracted. ' How much of this stuff has he had ? ' he demanded sharply of the young nurse. ' Only one dose, while he was unconscious,' she answered, surprised. The great man walked to the fireplace, and deliberately emptied the contents of the glass into it. ' Don't give him any more,' was all he said. ' Don't let him touch any medicine except what I order myself. Now let me see the wound. Where was he hit ? ' ' In the right side, under the arm,' said Campbell. ' The ball hasn't been found, and we are afraid it has penetrated too deeply to be extracted.' A puzzled expression appeared on the surgeon's face. ' Very strange,' he muttered to himself. ' Doesn't look as if he had a bullet inside him. Perhaps you will step into the next room for a minute, young lady ?' Fanny withdrew, and Sir Astley proceeded to bare the place where the bullet had struck. As soon as he saw the wound the puzzled expression on his face deepened. He probed about with his finger, and then the look of doubt suddenly changed to one of eager interest. He dexterously turned the patient over, and ran his finger across the skin of the back. ' Look ! ' he exclaimed with quiet triumph, pointing to a small blue mark in the skin on the left side. Campbell craned forward, and stared at the place, com pletely bewildered. ' The bullet has never been inside our friend at all,' ex plained the surgeon calmly. ' You can see for yourself what"], [107, "A BULLET AND ITS BILLET 97 has happened. It struck there, was deflected by the rib, and passed round under the skin, and came out here.' Teddy turned over rapidly and sat up. 'Then I'm all right !' he cried joyfully, 'and I can have something to eat ! ' The great specialist laughed. ' Certainly you may. But don't eat too much just at first. There has been a slight touch of fever, though it seems to have pretty nearly passed off.' Then he led Campbell to the other side of the room. ' I never like to say anything unfavourable about another professional man,' he said in a low voice, ' but I am not satisfied with the way in which this case has been treated. The dia gnosis must have been very careless, and the treatment adopted has been utterly unsuitable. I think your friend will be better left simply in the hands of his nurse. I will write a prescription \u2014 all he wants is a little quinine \u2014 and in a day or two he will be about again.' The Major bowed. He remembered that the doctor, had been originally brought on the scene by De Vaux and Metcalfe, and he shuddered at the suspicions which forced themselves upon his mind. As soon as he had written his prescription Sir Astley Cooper took his leave, fairly embarrassed by the gratitude that he had evoked. Half an hour afterwards, when the other doctor arrived, he was staggered to find his patient sitting up in bed, making a good meal. In the face of this evidence he made no attempt to dispute the lieutenant's statement that he felt well enough to dispense with his further services, and bowed himself out with the fee somewhat disdainfully handed to him by Major Campbell. 'And now,' said Teddy as the door closed on his medical attendant, ' it is my turn. Messrs. Sturmer & Co. have had their innings \u2014 let them look out when I begin mine ! ' H"], [108, "98 'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' CHAPTER X THE LAST STAKE In a few days Hervey was going about again, to all appearances as well as ever. This was a frightful blow to the conspirators, and their apprehensions were not lessened when Captain Metcalfe, who was still confined to his bed, received a curt note from the Military Secretary, conveying the opinion of the Commander of the Forces that, since Mr. Metcalfe found bis comrades so disagreeable to him that he had been obliged to shoot three of them within the last two years, it would be better for him to sell his commission without loss of time. More than one consultation was held at the house in St. James's Square, between Sturmer and De Vaux, with Lord Ely as a listener. The result was apparent soon afterwards in an intimacy which sprang up as if by magic between the viscount and Teddy. Both young men of about the same age, and officers in the same regiment, such an intimacy would have had nothing surprising about it under other circumstances. But considering the relations which evidently subsisted between Ely and the chief movers in the plot, Major Campbell found himself quite unable to understand the new turn of affairs. The second or third day he found Teddy alone, and spoke to him about it. ' I haven't seen much of you lately,' he began by remarking. ' Ah, no, to be sure, we haven't come across each other, have we ? But I have been all about the place. I was at Cremorne last night ; it was very brilliant, the gardens were one blaze of light, and they sent up a balloon.' The Major gazed with a certain anxiety at his young comrade."], [109, "THE LAST STAKE 99 ' Were you there with Ely ? ' he asked bluntly, at last. ' Yes, he was there, too,' responded the lieutenant with an assumption of carelessness. Campbell persisted. ' You have been with him a great deal lately, haven't you ?,' ' Yes, yes ; we do seem to have seen a good deal of each other the last few days.' ' Do you like the man ? ' ' Hardly that. He is a pleasant enough companion, when he isn't drunk.' ' Look here, Teddy, we are fencing with each other. What is your object in cultivating Ely's friendship?' ' To find out his object in cultivating mine ! ' This unexpected reply made the Major open his eyes. He had not given his friend credit for so much finesse. ' Isn't it rather a dangerous game to play ? ' he asked. ' It may be. But I am determined to go through with it. I mean to get to the bottom of this thing, at all costs. The Princess has invited me to go and receive her thanks, but I have sworn not to go till I have found out what Sturmer and his party are really up to. Ely drinks, and when he is drunk some time, I mean to make him talk.' Campbell shook his head rather doubtfully. ' 1 hope you may succeed. But in the meanwhile what is he trying to do with you ? Is he merely a spy, set on by the others to watch you, or what ? ' ' I don't think he is a spy, or if he is, he isn't the only one. Once or twice lately, I have fancied that I was being followed. No, I don't know what Ely's game is, but whatever it is, he will find me ready for him.' ' Shall you be at the Waterloo banquet to-night ? ' asked Campbell, abandoning any further attempt at warning. ' No. Is it being held still ? I thought they had abandoned it on account of the King's illness.' ' So they meant to ; at least, the Duke wrote to his Majesty offering to postpone it till his recovery ; but the King sent back a message that it was to be held as usual. The last bulletin from Windsor seems more favourable.' H 2"], [110, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 100 ' I see. It's to-night, is it ? ' 'To-day is the 18th.' 'Of course ! Well, I can't come. I've promised to dine at Buckles' to-night, with Ely, and take him on at ecarte afterwards.' ' Take care, Teddy ! Remember your last game of cards with that gang.' ' Oh, this is all right. Ely isn't a fighting man, and besides I shouldn't go out with him if he were to challenge me. I won a lot of money from him yesterday, and I have to give him his revenge.' Campbell said no more. He went away with an uneasy feeling in his mind ; and the lieutenant put on his hat and sauntered across to Ely's quarters. At eight o'clock the same evening the two young men met at the club in St. James's Street, as they had arranged, and had dinner together, apparently the greatest friends in the world. Viscount Ely was drinking less than usual, nevertheless his manner was excited, and he seemed restless to get the meal over and go into the card-room. ' You needn't be in such a hurry,' remonstrated Teddy, wondering at the other's eagerness. ' You have got all night to win your money back.' ' What are we waiting for now ? ' asked the other, after a minute. ' Well, there's another glass of port in this bottle, for one thing,' said Teddy, who began to find his companion's restless ness amusing. ' Let's have it brought in after us, then, and another bottle too, if you like. Anything's better than sitting in this d d room.' With these words the impatient ensign got up from the table. Teddy shrugged his shoulders, and followed him into the card-room, to a table set in a corner by the fireplace. Here they sat down, called for packs of cards, and began their game. Unfortunately Teddy had acted on his adversary's advice and ordered in a fresh bottle of wine. As the game proceeded,"], [111, "THE LAST STAKE 101 and the luck began to run against him, he helped himself to more than one glass, and it was not long before he became more excited than Ely. ' Hang it all ! ' he grumbled, as his opponent turned up the king for the third time running. ' I can't win to-night. I never had such a run against me in my life.' 1 Let's double the stakes, then,' suggested Ely. ' Your luck must turn before long.' Teddy gave his assent, and the game went on afresh. ' I have lost every penny I have about me ! ' exclaimed the lieutenant, after little more than an hour's play. 'Your I.O.U. will do just as well for me,' the other answered indifferently, lowering his eyes to conceal the flash of triumph that came into them. They played on. The original stakes had been five guineas a game. This had been already raised to ten, and after Hervey had gone on steadily losing for some time longer, the little viscount, keeping his eyes fixed on the table, said care lessly : ' We'll make it twenties if you 'Jike, just to give you a chance.' Teddy hesitated for an instant. His better instinct warned him to refuse the offer, but the temptation to recover his losses was too great. ' I'm your man,' he answered. And the play recommenced at the higher rate. By this time one or two other men had lounged into the room, and, seeing that a gambling duel was in progress, had collected round the table at which the two were seated. One of these onlookers was known to Teddy slightly, as a lieutenant in the Dragoon Guards, named Bourchier. After standing and watching the play for a few minutes, the dragoon officer said in a loud voice : ' I will back Mr. Hervey for five guineas to win the next game.' The offer thus thrown out was instantly accepted by another bystander. The game was played and lost, and Bourchier instantly exclaimed :"], [112, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 102 ' I double my bet on the next game ! Hervey, you would have won that time if you had refused to give him cards.' In spite of the ill fortune that attended Teddy's play, the dragoon continued to back him for varying amounts. After having thus acquired, according to the notions prevalent in such matters, a right to advise his champion, he presently said to him : ' Why don't you raise your stakes ? That is the only way to change the luck.' Ely instantly chimed in. ' I'm not afraid,' he said. ' We'll make it fifties if Hervey's game.' Thus insidiously lured on, Teddy's pride would not let him refuse. They played out another game ; he won by the odd point. ' Bravo ! ' cried his backer. ' Try it again.' But this change in the luck did not last. At the end of another hour, Teddy glanced at the figures of the I O U's he had signed, and was horrified by the total. 'Look here, I think I've had enough of this,' he said, throwing down his cards. ' Don't give in yet,' urged Bourchier. ' You're leaving off just at the wrong time.' Two or three of the other onlookers raised their voices either in persuasion or protest. Teddy looked round at his backer with a bitter smile. ' Do you want me to lose my commission? ' he asked. The ensign opposite pricked up his ears. ' I'll play you for your commission if you like,' he said quickly. It was a proposal to appeal to the gambling spirit of the day. A murmur of applause came from all sides. ' Come,' said Ely, glancing at the sums he had won. ' Half my winnings against your commission ? ' ' Done,' said Teddy suddenly. ' The best of three games?' ' Agreed.'"], [113, "THE LAST STAKE 103 The cards were dealt. In two hands the first game was finished. Teddy had won. The excitement now became intense. The viscount dealt the first hand of the next game, and turned up the king. Teddy asked for cards. His offer was refused. They played, and his opponent took the five tricks. With three points out of five against him, the lieutenant dealt. The king was in his own hand, with another trump. He looked up, expecting his adversary to ask for cards. To his surprise the Viscount at once led. Three tricks only fell to Teddy, and he scored two. The third hand was being dealt when a new-comer entered the room, and walked up to the group round the card-table. The sound of his footsteps struck familiarly on Teddy's ear, but he was too much absorbed in the study of his hand to give heed to anything else. Without a single trump, he demanded cards. Ely hesitated, glanced up over his opponent's shoulder to where Bourchier was standing, knitted his brows, and refused. Teddy led, and his first card was taken by a trump. But when the viscount came to lead, the reason of his hesitation as to giving fresh cards became apparent. He had nothing in his hand, and the next three cards fell to his opponent. Score, three all. Drawing a breath of relief, Teddy looked up, and found Major Campbell standing by his side, a severe look on his face. ' What are you playing for, Hervey ? ' he inquired. Teddy hung his head, ashamed to answer. ' His commission ! ' came from several of the others. And the circumstances of the bet were eagerly explained to the Major. Campbell heard with increasing severity of face. But in the meantime, Teddy was dealing the cards afresh. As soon as he had done sorting his hand, Ely raised his eyes, glanced across the lieutenant's shoulder once more, and then demanded cards."], [114, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 104 As he did so, Campbell deliberately walked up to Lieutenant Bourchier, and whispered something in his ear. The dragoon started back, a red flush mounting to the roots of his hair. He seemed about to speak when the Major made him a sign to come with him, and led the way to the other end of the room. ' It is useless for you to deny it, sir,' he said, speaking in a low voice, but with stern emphasis. ' I saw you make the signal twice with my own eyes. If I had not my own reasons for avoiding a scandal at this moment, I should have denounced you and your confederate publicly.' ' I suppose you know what this entails, sir ? ' demanded the dragoon, who had by this time recovered himself, and spoke with a defiant air. ' If you mean that for a challenge, I refuse to accept it,' returned Campbell with severity. ' And let me warn you, that if I hear of your challenging any friend of mine, I shall go straight to the Commander of the Forces, and acquaint him with the real motives of your other affairs of ho?wur.' Bourchier's jaw dropped ; in an instant the flush forsook his face, leaving it of ghastly leaden colour, he stared at the Major for a minute without speaking, and then turned on his heel, and slunk out of the room, and out of the club. Campbell walked back to the card-table. The last hand had just been played out, and Teddy sat the victor. His com mission was saved, and half his losses of the evening were handed back to him by the discomfited ensign. 'And now, gentlemen, if you have finished, I have a stake to propose,' said the Major in a peculiar tone of voice, that caused the little viscount to glance at him with apprehension. ' But as the stake which I am going to propose is a private one, perhaps these other gentlemen will not object to leaving us by ourselves for a few minutes.' There was that in his voice which checked remonstrance or question. The little crowd of spectators dispersed, and the two players were left facing each other, with only the Major between them."], [115, "THE LAST STAKE 105 AVithout giving either of them time to speak, he went on gravely, addressing the lieutenant : 'Since my entrance in this room, I regret to say that I have twice observed Lord Ely looking for directions as to his play to Mr. Bourchier, who was overlooking your hand. I have charged Mr. Bourchier with the fact, and he has left in conse quence. What I now suggest is that you should play Lord Ely by himself, for a stake which he may be willing to accept as against the remainder of his winnings, namely, his honour.' The viscount turned red and purple, while Teddy stared at him open-eyed. ' You shall answer for this, Major Campbell ! ' came in thick accents from the accused man. 1 Before you call on me to answer, consider your position, my lord,' returned the Major coolly. ' It is in my power to make a public exposure. I have not done so. You are a young man, and I offer you a chance of retrieving your position. If you decline you leave me no alternative but to call back those gentlemen, and explain to them what I have seen, and why I cannot meet you.' These words were succeeded by a short silence. Ely sat gnawing his lip, and frowning, with his eyes on the cards before him, too choked with shame and rage to say anything. Sud denly Teddy, who had been pondering over the situation, spoke for himself. ' I have a different stake to propose. Lord Ely is welcome to his winnings, if he chooses to keep them. But his honour is too valuable a thing to be set against money. The stake I offer him is the one which I meant to offer if fortune had gone the other way, as I hoped it would, and enabled me to win all his money. I will set your honour ' \u2014 he addressed his adversary directly for the first time \u2014 ' against your secret. If I lose, nothing shall be said of this business outside. If you lose, you shall tell me the whole truth about the plot against the Princess of Kent.' Campbell drew back his chair with an ejaculation of surprised approval. ' You are right, Teddy ! That is the proper stake.'"], [116, "106 ' GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ! ' The viscount glanced uneasily from one to the other. In the face of the discovery Campbell had made, it was useless to protest that they were asking him to play the traitor. In the eyes of these two he was already a dishonoured man. The chance they offered him was to preserve that dishonour a secret from the world. ' I consent,' he said suddenly. ' I am in your power.' He took up the cards lying scattered on the table, and began to shuffle them. ' Stop ! ' cried Teddy, his imagination heated by the excite ment he had passed through. ' We will not play out a game. Put the pack between us, and let each draw a card alternately. If you draw a king first, you have won ; if I draw a queen, I have ! ' The other agreed in silence. The pack was shuffled by both, cut by Major Campbell, and placed in position. Teddy drew first, a nine of clubs. Ely drew a two of diamonds. Teddy followed with a knave, and his heart beat violently. A five of diamonds followed, then a ten, then another deuce. Gasping for breath Teddy put out his hand again, glanced at the card, uttered a loud cry, and flung down on the table the queen of hearts. The three men rose simultaneously, and then sat down again. 'Well?' said Teddy, after a minute had passed in dead silence. And Ely began his revelation. ' I can only tell you what I know. A few months ago, when I was gazetted, they began to sound me \u2014 Metcalfe and the others \u2014 about the Duke of Cumberland. As soon as they found I was inclined to listen, they took me round to Baron Sturmer's, and he convinced me that the Duke was the rightful heir to the throne. Then they explained that it would be impossible to get his claim recognised by the Reform Parlia ment, that it was really not so much a question of King against Queen, as of aristocracy against democracy, and that it would be necessary for the Prince's supporters to take action independent of Parliament. They swore me in as a member"], [117, "THE LAST STAKE 107 of the party, and then they explained what their plan was. They said the whole situation turned on the army. The army was strong enough to put the Prince on the throne if it chose. And the army would follow the lead of the Household Brigade- More than half the officers of the Guards, they told me, were in the plot. As soon as ever the King's death is known, the Duke of Cumberland will issue a manifesto, assuming the crown, and dissolving Parliament. At the same time the officers of the Guards will rise in his favour, and bring over their men by promises of liberal gratuities. Then we are to surround the Houses of Parliament, and arrest any member who tries to enter, occupy the Government offices in the name of King Ernest, and make the Princess a prisoner. After that the King will declare the Reform Act and Catholic Emanci pation null and void, as having been carried by force, and summon a Parliament on the old franchise, which will recog nise his title and pass an Act of Indemnity.' Such, briefly put, was the story which the viscount poured into the ears of his listeners, who sat speechless, so struck were they by the audacity of the scheme, and the grave chances of success which it seemed to present. A disputed succession, and a civil war, seemed to be the least of evils which stared them in the face. ' Come,' said Campbell, rising at last, ' this is too important a matter to be discussed here. Let us go to the barracks, to my quarters. Lord Ely, have you any objection to come with us ? ' The little viscount got up, looking very red. ' I want to ask one thing,' he said in a low voice. 'I hate Sturmer and his whole gang. They have made me play the part of a scoundrel, and I know it. They meant to ruin Hervey, and drive him out of the army, as they had sailed to kill him, and they used me as their instrument. But \u2014 but I can't keep your money, Hervey. Won't you take it back ? ' And he pushed his winnings across the table. For a moment Teddy hesitated. Then his natural kindli ness asserted itself. ' All right, Ely,' he said, sweeping the notes and I O U's"], [118, "108 'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!\" into his pocket. ' And, as far as I am concerned, you shall never hear anything more about it.' He held out his hand to his unfortunate adversary as he spoke. Then the three men quitted the room, and took their way in silence through the deserted streets of the sleeping city \u2014 sleeping in utter unconsciousness of the armed rising which was being concerted in its midst."], [119, "log CHAPTER XI WHAT TOOK PLACE ON THE NIGHT OF THE 19TH OF JUNE As the clock of Kensington Church struck eleven on the night of the 19th of June, 1837, a singular movement became observable in the sleeping Palace. The moon, which was still low in the summer sky, threw the heavy facade of the Palace into deep shadow. All along the rambling sides of the building darkness and quiet reigned, except in one corner of the right wing of the Palace. Here, on the first floor, there was a row of windows behind whose close-drawn blinds lamps were still burning. The soft light, filtering through the blinds, caused the row of luminous squares to stand out with ghostly distinctness from the black sombre walls ; and each window became, as it were, the lighted screen of a shadow-pantomime, on which the spectator could see a representation of what was passing behind. It was in this quarter of the Palace that the movement already referred to seemed to be taking place. Before describing what this was, it is necessary to remark that the shadow drama was not passing unobserved. Down below in the private gardens of the Palace there stood a young man, concealed behind the dark branches of a small cedar tree, who kept his eyes fixed on the row of lighted windows above, with the attentive gaze of one who was deeply interested in what he saw. This young man, whose figure was shrouded in the folds of a long military cloak, crowned by a soft wide-brimmed hat, had alighted in the Kensington High Street a few minutes before from a hackney coach which instantly drove away again towards London. On alighting, the wearer of the military"], [120, "' GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ! ' 110 cloak had gone up the lane leading to the Palace, and found his way to a small gate in the palings which surrounded the private grounds. By means of a key which he had brought with him, he had let himself inside, carefully closing and locking the gate after him. He had then taken his stand in the shelter of the cedar, in an attitude of watchful expectation. The watcher did not suspect that he was himself being watched by a second intruder on the privacy of the Palace grounds. Such was the case. Hardly had the coach which Drought him to Kensington started on its return journey when it was met and passed by a small private carriage of the kind named after the ex-Lord Chancellor, Brougham. Drawing up at almost the same spot as the other vehicle, the brougham de posited its occupant, and then drove a little way on into the village of Kensington, where it drew up. The personage who had alighted from the brougham was even more closely muffled up than the man whom he appeared to be tracking. Only his manner of walking indicated that he was a man somewhat more advanced in years. He proceeded to the same gate as that by which the younger man had entered, and for which the second comer, too, had brought a key. As soon as he found himself inside the grounds he advanced, without staying to lock the gate behind him, but using every pre caution to conceal his movements, in search of the first comer. The principal hindrance he met with was from the dark ness, as the young man had taken no precautions to conceal himself from any one approaching from the rear. In a minute the second comer caught sight of his quarry, and began to move with a stealthy, gliding step towards the spot. Just as he was closing in upon the unconscious man, however, a sudden movement on the latter's part threw him off his purpose, and caused him to shrink back for a moment in the shelter of the nearest shrubs. This movement on the part of the young man was due, in its turn, to something which he had just observed passing on the illuminated casements overhead. It is now time to indicate more clearly the nature of this mysterious spectacle. To begin with, the pantomime \u2014 if it may be so termed \u2014"], [121, "THE NIGHT OF THE i9th OF JUNE 111 appeared to embrace two performers. One of these performers had not come sufficiently near the window to cast a distinct outline on the blind ; the figure could only be seen as a vague gigantic shadow, which moved slowly from time to time across the two windows which were situated at the end of the row, next to the corner of the facade, and furthest from the central portion of the Palace. Finally, this shadow became stationary, subsiding at the same time in a manner which suggested that the person casting it was sitting down. The second actor in the drama appeared to remain standing. It was the action of this second figure that was of a nature to rouse the greatest curiosity in the spectator. The shadow, in this case, owing to the greater nearness to the blind of the person casting it, assumed a singularly clear outline. It was the silhouette of a girl or woman, who seemed to be animated by some strong feeling. By her attitude, she was addressing the seated figure, and her gestures were those of earnest entreaty. From time to time the entreating shadow advanced to, or receded from, the other, but all the time keeping up the same energetic language of action. At last this shadow, too, sub sided, leaving only the head and bust outlined above the sill of the window. There could be no mistake as to what had happened. The girl was on her knees before the other actor in the scene. Thirty or forty seconds ticked themselves away while this singular situation continued. And then it was that the move ment took place which had affected the situation below in the garden. For the kneeling shadow rose suddenly, became blurred and gigantesque for an instant, and then began to pass in swift progression across all the other windows of the illumi nated row, till it vanished at the opposite end. The effect of this movement on the first of the two visitors to the garden was to cause him to utter a subdued exclamation of relief, and at the same time to move out from the shelter of the cedars, and walk towards the Palace. This change evidently disconcerted his pursuer, who followed cautiously, dodging from bush to bush as he crept on the other's trail."], [122, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 112 Proceeding thus, the foremost of the two men came up to a small postern door in the wall of the Palace, evidently con structed to give access to the garden. Just as he reached it, the door was softly opened, and the figure of a young girl in evening dress, with a light shawl thrown over her neck and bosom, appeared in the entrance. The forefinger of one hand was pressed on her lips, to enjoin silence, and in the other hand she carried a candle, the flame of which flickered gently in the night breeze. It was evident that the young man had been expecting this sight. He made two steps forward, and quickly passed inside the door, which was silently closed on him before his pursuer could decide on any course of action. Muttering a curse, the baffled man turned away, and moved back towards the gate by which they had both entered. Here he stopped, hesitated for a short time, and then walked slowly towards his carriage. Meanwhile a hurried colloquy was going on between the young man and the girl who had admitted him into the Palace. ' Does she consent to see me, then ? ' were the first words that escaped from his eager lips. The girl regarded him with a slightly offended air. ' Yes, Teddy, I have persuaded her at last, though it was very hard work. But, of course, I don't count.' ' Fanny ! ' burst from her dismayed lover. ' How can you say so ? You know the only reason I have set myself to fight this conspiracy is because you asked me.' ' Oh ! I thought you seemed to think more about the Princess than me,' complained the spoilt young beauty, still unsatisfied. Teddy took the hint. ' My sweet, dear girl ! ' he exclaimed. ' Forgive me. I know I am awfully stupid and clumsy, but I thought you didn't want any words from me, by this time, to convince you that you were the foremost person in the world to me. Say the word, and I will go straight away and join the Duke of Cumberland ! '"], [123, "THE NIGHT OF THE i9th OF JUNE 113 This handsome submission produced the desired effect. Fanny allowed herself to smile, as she responded : ' Traitor ! If I thought you were serious I would have you arrested. But come upstairs at once ; her Royal Highness is waiting. Everybody in the Palace has gone to bed, so walk softly.' She turned, and conducted him up a deserted staircase, and along the corridor which led to the lighted suite of rooms. In the first of these he left his hat and military cloak, after which he followed Fanny till she stopped and knocked at a closed door beyond. ' Is that Lady Fanny ? ' inquired a clear, musical voice from the other side. Fanny answered, and received permission to enter. She opened the door and ushered in the young officer. The room in which he found himself was not very spacious. It was a simply furnished boudoir or morning room, evidently that of a young girl. Nothing about the chamber spoke of great rank or wealth, but everything was exquisitely neat and refined. The furniture was in a plain and rather heavy style, which would be accounted ugly in these days, but which sixty years ago passed for tasteful simplicity. Many of the ornaments on the mantelshelf were of a quaint, staring pattern, such as now would be tolerated merely for its curiosity. Against one wall stood the piece of furniture known as a 'chiffonier ; ' while the middle of the room was filled by a round table supported by a single leg, and covered with a heavy crimson cloth drooping almost to the ground. A case of wax flowers occupied the centre of the table, and round the edge were ranged various gilt-edged volumes : ' The Book of Beauty,' ' The Anniver sary,' and other fashionable compilations which held the place of the modern magazine. But it was not the furniture of the room which attracted the attention of the lieutenant. Seated in an armchair facing the door by which he had entered was a young lady about whom a word of description may be permissible. Her age was just eighteen, and the freshness of her complexion, coupled with the perfect innocence of her look and bearing, gave her an i"], [124, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 114 air of even greater youthfulness. Although seated, it was per ceivable that her height was considerably below the average ; but this drawback, if it were such, was concealed by the extreme grace of her slender figure, and by an air of native and unaffected dignity which pervaded her whole pose, and prevented the mind of the observer from receiving any un favourable impression from the mere lack of stature. The beauty of the face was of a type equally rare and pleasing. It depended not so much on the classic grace of the profile, as on the spiritual loveliness which pervaded and animated every feature, and carried the mind back to the ideals bequeathed by painters of a Saint Agnes or a Saint Catherine, or even a more sacred type of feminine beauty. The brow was arched and lofty, and this appearance was increased by the fashion in which the hair was worn, brushed smoothly down over the temples, and back across the ears. The eyes were clear and expressive ; their look spoke of sincerity, while it betrayed, perhaps, a certain lack of humour \u2014 an almost Puritan re striction in their owner's outlook on life. The lower part of the face, in spite of its delicately moulded lines, conveyed the impression of latent force of will, yet dominated by that strong natural kindliness of heart which remained, after all, the greatest charm of that fair young face. It would be an \u2022omission not to refer to the rare distinction of the tiny hand which was extended for the visitor to salute, and the equally delicate foot in its satin slipper which rested on a footstool below. Such, on the eve of her accession, was the princess who was destined to reign with almost unchequered glory and prosperity, for an unexampled length of years, over the fore most race and empire of the globe. A courtier might enlarge the above portrait, and embellish it with sickly superlatives of praise ; but it is perhaps the highest tribute to the illustrious subject, that the sober language of truth from a pen not aiming to flatter perforce assumes the character of a eulogium. ' You are welcome, Mr. Hervey,' said the Princess kindly, as Teddy bowed low over the hand which she had allowed him to kiss. ' I thank you for the zeal which has brought you"], [125, "THE NIGHT OF THE i9th OF JUNE 115 here, though I am sorry you were obliged to ask me to receive you at so late an hour.' The young man shook his head as he answered : ' I am well aware I have to apologise to your Royal Highness for the liberty I have taken. I can only assure you that your enemies are so alert and so unscrupulous that I dared not be seen entering the Palace. Even as it i? , I cannot be quite certain that I have shaken off the spies who have been dogging me for the last few days, though I have taken all sorts of precautions to throw them off the scent.' The Princess looked alarmed. ' I hope these persons you speak of have no designs beyond watching your movements? You have been wounded once already in my service ; I should be shocked if I thought there were any possibility of your being attacked again.' Teddy blushed at these gracious expressions, while he marvelled inwardly at the extreme dignity which marked every word of the royal maiden. ' I thank you, Madam, I have no fears of that kind. But they are desperate men, and if they gathered from any action on my part that their plot was discovered, it might drive them to extreme measures of some kind. They might even not wait for the King's death.' Here the Princess raised her hand with a shrinking gesture. ' Do not refer to that before me, Mr. Hervey, if you please. I must be the last person in the kingdom to contemplate it as a possibility. But tell me what measures you mean. Lady Fanny has told me what she has heard about this conspiracy, but I can hardly believe that it really exists.' ' I am sorry to have to tell you that it does, and that it is far more dangerous than your Royal Highness has any idea of. But for that I should not have ventured to intrude on you in this fashion.' ' You need make no excuses for that, sir. After what you have done already, I feel that I can trust in you implicitly.' Again the lieutenant coloured with pleasure. Bowing low, he went on : ' It was only last night that my friend, Major Campbell, 1 2"], [126, "' GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ! ' 116 and I, succeeded in extorting a full confession from a member of the party.' The Princess looked up. ' Who was he ? ' Teddy became embarrassed. \u2022Will you forgive me, Madam, if I ask you not to require his name ? I am certain that he thoroughly repents the part he played in the conspiracy, and I should not like his name to have evil associations in the thoughts of his future sovereign.' Much to Teddy's relief, the Princess at once nodded approval. 'You are perfectly right. It is better that I should not hear any names that can be possibly avoided. Go on, if you please.' ' I am glad to say that the moving spirit of the affair is not an Englishman, but a Hanoverian \u2014 Baron Sturmer. I am afraid that I must allude lo the personage around whom the plot centres.' ' You mean my Uncle Ernest ? ' said the Princess, sadly. ' I do. I have no actual proof against him, but the whole scheme of the conspirators implies that he is a consenting party.' The Princess drooped her head. ' Why must I hear of such things ? ' she exclaimed patheti cally. ' Oh how terrible it is to have to listen to accusations of treason against those from whom I hoped to receive support and protection ! ' This plaintive appeal, coming straight from the heart of the orphaned Princess, moved Teddy profoundly, and brought the tears into Fanny's eyes. Coming forward, and throwing her self on her knees before her young mistress, she cried : ' Do not let yourself be distressed by the enmity of a single man, when there are millions ready to die for you ! Think of us, Madam ; let the love of a whole nation console you for the enmity of one relation who is unworthy of you ! ' The Princess sighed, as she laid her fingers for a moment on Fanny's curls. ' Ah, yes, you are right to remind me that I am a public"], [127, "THE NIGHT OF THE i9th OF JUNE 117 personage, with other things to consider than my private feelings. But do you know, Fanny, I sometimes forget that I am a Princess of England, and feel just like you do when things go wrong in your own family.' She made the kneeling girl rise, and turned gravely to the lieutenant. ' You must not mind my weakness, Mr. Hervey. Tell me whatever you consider I ought to know.' Thus commanded, Teddy laid before her the full details of Ely's confession, emphasising, as he went along, the imminence of the peril it disclosed. ' If the country is to be spared, I will not say a civil war, but at all events a dangerous outbreak in the capital, which would cast a cloud over your reign, I believe that action must be taken at once. Major Campbell thinks the same as I do. We have already approached Lord Melbourne, who cannot see the gravity of the situation, and the Commander of the Forces, Lord Hill, who declines to interfere in a political affair. I have come to ask you, Madam, to take the matter up yourself.' ' There is only one thing to be done, I am afraid,' said the Princess, who had listened with the closest attention. 'You must go and appeal in my name to my uncle.' ' To the Duke of Cumberland ! ' exclaimed Teddy. 'No, to the King.' ' Ah ! ' The expression of the young man's face showed that this was a course which had not occurred to him. Nevertheless, now it was put before him, he at once recognised that it was the only possible thing to do. ' You must go straight from here to Windsor,' pursued the Princess, speaking with quiet decision. ' I am afraid the King is very ill, but I know he will do what is necessary to protect me.' ' Will your Royal Highness give me a letter to the King ? ' inquired Teddy. ' That might not get to him. I will give you a letter to my aunt, the Queen. She loves me as much as if I were"], [128, "118 'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' her daughter, and she will see that you are brought in to the King.' The Princess went to a small writing-table in a corner of the room, and hastily scribbled a few lines, while the two lovers conversed in whispers. As soon as she had sealed the letter the Princess advanced towards them, a gentle smile on her face. ' I must be careful, or Lady Maldon will regret that she entrusted me with her daughter.' A conscience-stricken look came on Teddy's face. His sweetheart lifted her eyes boldly to the Princess's. ' You will never speak about Mr. Hervey to my mother, Madam ? ' she said imploringly. ' I am not so sure about that,' was the ambiguous response. ' Here is the letter, Mr. Hervey : lose not an hour on the way, I beg of you.' 'I will not lose a second, Madam,' said Teddy. And the second he employed in taking leave of Fanny at the postern door really ought not to count."], [129, "ii9 CHAPTER XII A RACE FOR A CROWN As the lieutenant strode quickly to the gate by which he had arrived, he pulled out his watch and glanced at it. The hands were at twenty-five minutes to twelve. His interview with the Princess had lasted half an hour. Just as he restored the watch to its place in his fob, he reached the gateway. He was in the act of stepping through, when he suddenly checked himself in astonishment mingled with alarm. Half an hour before he had carefully locked the gate behind him with the key despatched by Fanny in answer to a secret message earlier in the day. Now it stood wide open. It was impossible to doubt what had happened. Some one \u2014 some enemy, doubtless \u2014 had been there on his track ! Teddy peered out. There was nothing visible in the little lane leading down to the High Street. He was about to go down it, when he suddenly altered his mind, and strode off at a fast pace towards the church. In a minute he changed his walk into a run, and finding his cloak an encumbrance, he took it off, rolled it up in a rough bundle, and tossed it over the palings of the churchyard as he went by. Then he went on round the church, and down into the main road by another lane a little further on. Arrived in the street of the village, he glanced cautiously up and down. Sure enough, standing halfway between him and the turning he had avoided, was a small carriage which he recognised as one of the fashionable new pattern, harnessed to two horses, and evidently the property of some person of consequence."], [130, "120 ' GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ! ' ' Stunner's for a thousand pounds ! ' exclaimed Teddy to himself. ' And just what I need to get me to Windsor,' he added in his own mind. He took a few steps back in the direction of the carriage, keeping in the shadow of the wall, and treading as softly as a cat. There was a coachman on the box of the vehicle, whose head was drooping forward on his breast, in an attitude of slumber. On the pavement beside the carriage door stood a stout, closely muffled figure, about whose identity Teddy had no real doubt. It was the Hanoverian waiting for him to issue from the Palace. Sturmer's back was towards him, the Baron's natural expec tation being that Hervey would come down the other lane, the one he had used already. The lieutenant was, therefore, able to creep close up without fear of being perceived. Arrived within forty or fifty paces of the carriage, he halted, consider ing how to act. At this moment his unsuspicious adversary played into his hands, by doing the one thing which was necessary to ensure the success of the daring scheme which had taken shape in Teddy's mind. Impatient at what seemed to him the inter minable delay in the lieutenant's re-appearance, Sturmer began to walk slowly away from the carriage towards the corner of the lane down which he expected his victim to come. Teddy's course was now clear. Step by step, as the Baron moved off, he crept closer and closer, till he was at the horses' heads. The brougham had drawn up with its off side against the path. Accordingly Teddy stepped out into the road, passed round in front of the horses, and put his foot on the near axle, with the intention of climbing into the vacant seat beside the sleeping driver. But in doing this he reckoned without the horses. Dis turbed by the sight of a stranger passing close to their heads, and restive after their long wait, the animals began to fidget, and one of them jerked impatiently at the traces. Roused by the movement, the coachman started out of his doze and sat up, instinctively tightening his grasp on the reins,"], [131, "A RACE FOR A CROWN 121 when suddenly he was aware of a man springing on to the box beside him and thrusting the naked muzzle of a pistol against his ear, with the fiercely whispered command : ' Drive for your life ! ' At the same moment Sturmer came running back from behind, shouting out at the top of his voice : ' Thief ! Highwayman ! Stop ! ' But these words only served to confirm the unfortunate man's terror. Firmly convinced that it was indeed some desper ate outlaw of the Dick Turpin class whom he had to deal with, he paid no heed to his master, but started his horses off at a fran tic gallop, which soon left the Hanoverian hopelessly in the rear- Windows were thrown up, and nightcapped heads thrust out, as the carriage rattled through the sleeping village, and numerous voices took up the cry raised by the enraged Sturmer, as he realised that he had furnished his enemy with the means of escaping him. But the coachman felt the cold pistol barrel still against his ear and drove on without slackening speed. It was not till the first toll-gate came in sight that the frightened man ventured to check his horses, casting at the same time a doubtful glance at the supposed highwayman. But Teddy had had time to arrange his plan of action by now. Withdrawing the pistol for a minute as they approached the gate, be said in swift, decisive tones : ' Understand, your life is in my power, and if you disobey me for an instant, I shall shoot you like a dog. But I am not a highwayman. I am the bearer of despatches to the King at Windsor, and in the King's name I order you to take me there ! The coachman looked half relieved, half incredulous. ' What will my master say ? ' he muttered. ' I will answer to your master, and if he dismisses you I will find you a better situation.' Before Teddy could say more the toll-house was reached, and the sleepy pikeman was seen issuing from his door. Teddy flung him a half-crown, as the carriage drew up, and he was beginning to unfasten the gate, when the noise of shouts from behind caused him to stop abruptly and look round."], [132, "' GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ! ' 122 ' In the King's name, open the gate ! ' shouted Teddy. ' I am the bearer of despatches.' And as the man still hesitated, he sprang from the box, took out the Princess's letter and held it before the pike keeper's blinking eyes. But the pike-keeper only shook his head. ' I can't read,' he grumbled. And glancing back across his shoulder to where the figure of a man running at full speed was just in sight, he demanded suspiciously, ' What are they a chasing you for?' There was no time for argument or explanation. Slipping the letter into his pocket, Teddy snatched the pikeman's keys from him before he knew what was happening, and then, with a well-directed blow of his fist, sent him flying into the ditch beside the road. Luckily the coachman was too cowardly to take advantage of this diversion to make any effort to escape, and in a few seconds the young officer had un locked and thrown back the gate, remounted the box of the brougham, and was driving on at full speed towards Hounslow Heath. But fast as the carriage went, it was not fast enough to satisfy the impatience of the Princess's messenger. ' It is no use, I must take one of the horses out, and ride,' he said to himself. 'Even without a saddle I shall get along quicker than this.' He ordered the driver to pull up, and explained his deter mination. The man dismounted, without daring to offer any opposition, and proceeded to unharness the horse which the lieutenant pointed out to him. While he was doing so Teddy walked up to the other horse, and presented his pistol at its head. He stood like that for a minute, his brows knitted in troubled thought. 'No!' he said to himself, withdrawing the weapon, 'I haven't the heart to kill the poor brute. I must risk being followed. I have got a good start, and I dare say I'm as good a rider as that cursed German.' By this time the other horse was free from the carriage. A bridle was hastily manufactured out of the reins, Teddy seized"], [133, "A RACE FOR A CROWN 123 the driver's whip, cutting off the lash to make it manageable, and sprang lightly on to the animal's bare back. ' That will do. You can go back and tell your master that Lieutenant Hervey, of the Guards, has borrowed his horse, and he will find it in the morning in the stables of Windsor Castle.' He struck his mount with the stump of the whip, and went off at a gallop through the night, leaving the wretched coachman standing in the road beside his carriage, with the loose harness and torn reins dragging on the ground. Mile after mile he galloped on, past sleeping towns and quiet villages, till the panting horse, unused to such exertions, began to show signs of distress, and he was obliged to ease down for a time into a canter, to let it get wind afresh. Mile after mile the white road, flecked with shadows from its bordering trees, rose up and went down again under his horse's feet. Brentford was reached and passed, the town of Hounslow showed up on the horizon, grew large, and then faded into the distance. Now the famous heath lay before him, haunt of so many heroes of the road in days that still seemed recent, scene of the exploits of Jack Sheppard and the elegant Claude Duval. He hesitated as he came to the spot where the road forked, one branch going southward to Staines and ancient Egham, the other trending off northward to Slough. But it was this northern road he took, pressing onward past many a little hamlet of which he knew not even the name, and only marking the grey milestones as they loomed out dimly from time to time against the grassy banks of the highway. More than once along the road he came to another pike, but now there were no pursuers within hearing, and the only delay he met with was due to the sleepiness and slowness of the man in charge. The longing rose up in his mind to be on the back of his own favourite hunter at home, and leap these tiresome obstacles, but with a strange animal, fresh from the shafts, he dared not take the risk. So he rode on, till the last long stretch of road into Slough was left behind, and turning sharply to the left he passed out of the village to the south, and saw before him the rounded"], [134, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 124 outline of the low hill, crowned with Plantagenet's tower, the nursery of many a royal line. And just as those famous walls came into view, he heard the dull tinkle of hoofs upon the road behind him, and looking back, saw another horseman galloping fiercely on his track. He was pursued. Now was the time to cling tightly to his seat and urge his tired horse to its utmost pace. When he was younger he had often raced his brothers, riding bare-backed all over the park of W\"isbeach Manor, and that experience stood him in good stead to-night. On and on he pressed, bringing down the whip handle on the steaming haunches of his steed, to force it to renewed efforts. But all the time he heard his pursuer gaining and gaining on him, till the tinkle of the hoof-beats swelled into a thunder, and at last his ears were assailed by a hoarse shout : \u2014 ' Stop, or I fire ! ' Without slackening his pace for a moment, he turned his head and glanced backward. The fierce eyes of the German glared at him from a face whose flushed, convulsive working told of the passions raging within. And Teddy's heart sank as he saw that the horse bestridden by his enemy was the very one he had abandoned to him, but \u2014 and this accounted for his being overtaken in the race \u2014 his enemy had somehow managed to provide himself with a saddle and stirrups, and with spurs which he was even now digging relentlessly into the wretched animal's bleeding sides. Teddy turned his glance forward once more. The first lights of Eton were already faintly visible. One more desperate struggle, and he would be saved. At full gallop he sprang forward, his own desperate resolve seeming to communicate itself to the horse between his knees. All at once he heard a sharp click, followed by an oath. Sturmer's pistol had missed fire. Exulting in his escape, the young man redoubled his efforts. The gallant horse, breathing in great snorts, tore up to the outermost houses of the town, and began racing up the street towards the bridge. Even the Hanoverian hardly dare sire at"], [135, "A RACE FOR A CROWN 125 him now. Yet the pursuer pressed on and on, he drew up yard after yard, inch after inch, till, as they dashed madly over the narrow bridge and began to breast the steep ascent to the Castle, he was level with the man he had chased for those twenty miles. He was beside him, he had even put out his hand to thrust him from the saddle, when, as they swung round the corner, knee to knee, there was a sudden rattle and clash of arms, a challenge rang out through the air, and as the aroused sentry sprang forward with fixed bayonet, Teddy rolled off his staggering horse, and found himself inside the Castle gates. He looked at his watch. It was a quarter past one ; he had come from Kensington in a little over an hour and a half. It did not take long to satisfy the sentry as to his business at the Castle. While the defeated Baron was retiring from the gate, the bearer of the Princess's letter was being conducted through the silent moonlit courtyards to the apartments of the dying King. He waited in an anteroom while the letter he had brought was taken in to Queen Adelaide. In less than five minutes one of the Queen's women came and brought him into a room immediately adjoining the sick-chamber. Here he found the wife of William IV., stately and beautiful still, but haggard and worn out by weeks of continual nursing, during the last fort night of which she had not once removed her dress, and had scarcely quitted her husband's side for five minutes. So impressed was Hervey by the distress and suffering of the royal lady, that he felt almost reluctant to speak to her of the matter which had brought him thither. But the Queen, rising superior to her own griefs, insisted on know ing all. She seemed to be shocked rather than astonished by Teddy's disclosures. ' All this is only too much in keeping with Ernest's character,' she said, more to herself than to the lieutenant. ' Family affection has no meaning for him, death no sadness. One brother must be disturbed in his last hours in order to protect another brother's orphan from his envious plots !"], [136, "126 ' GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ! ' Wait for me,' she added, rising ; ' I will go in and prepare my dear husband, and then I expect he will wish to see you.' The Queen went into the next room, leaving Teddy alone. He was presently joined, however, by a middle-aged man of dignified presence and open, kindly face. ' The Queen has sent me to you, Mr. Hervey,' he said. ' I am Lord Conyngham, the Chamberlain. You must want some refreshments after your long ride?' At first Teddy refused, but the Marquis of Conyngham insisted, till he consented to take some wine and a slice of cold fowl. While a tray was being brought, the Marquis in turn questioned him as to the alarming intelligence of which he was the bearer, and showed no little indignation when he heard of Sturmer's unscrupulous and vindictive tactics. 'It is my impression,' said Teddy, in conclusion, ' that this man has spies here in the Castle. I heard him speak of having private intelligence as to the state of the King's health.' The Lord Chamberlain looked startled. ' That sounds too horrible ! ' he exclaimed. ' But if it is true, we must take additional precautions. I will go and give orders at once that not a soul is to leave the Castle till further orders.' And, bending his head towards the lieutenant, he whispered : 'We do not expect his Majesty to outlive the night ! ' Teddy was startled in bis turn. ' In that case, my lord, it is imperative to keep the news secret till the Princess has had time to take measures of some kind against this attempt.' The Marquis nodded, and left the room to give his orders. Meanwhile the refreshments arrived, and Teddy had just finished a hasty meal, when the door of the sick-room opened, and one of the doctors beckoned him to enter. Rising and treading softly, he walked with bowed head into the chamber where the last King of Britain and Hanover lay dying. In the worn frame and shrunken lineaments of the sick man extended on the bed before him, it was difficult to recog nise the stout, hearty seaman whom he had always been accustomed to associate with the idea of William IV. William"], [137, "A RACE FOR A CROWN 127 lay, with his head propped on the pillows, breathing pain fully, his face turned to one side so as to allow his wistful eyes to seek the dear face of that wife whose devotion had been his chief comfort amid the sorrows and vexations of his declining years. Her tender care of him through this long, painful illness, rare in any woman, still rarer in a queen, had taught him the full value of a treasure he had sometimes neglected in his younger and stormier days. It was a touching picture, all the more so from its extreme homeliness. For there was nothing stately, nothing regal, about the poor old man who lay there fighting for a few more hours of life. The monarch was gone, only the poor, broken human sinner was left. By one side of the bed stood a white-haired clergyman. It did not require his episcopal dress to tell the lieutenant that this was the venerable Howley, Archbishop of Canterbury, who had administered the last sacrament to the dying man, and consoled him with the beautiful prayers of the liturgy. At a little distance from this group stood others, but Teddy had no eyes for them. In obedience to a sign from the sick man he stepped to the side of the bed, and bent down to catch his dying whisper. ' Tell my niece she did right to send you to me. They are writing a paper for me to sign \u2014 I recognise her as my only lawful successor. As soon as it is ready you must go back to London ; go straight to the Duke, and tell him from me that with my last breath I entrust my niece to his care, and ask him to so deal by her that his last hour may be as peaceful as mine.' A fit of coughing succeeded these solemn words, during which the young man looked round for a moment, be wildered. Queen Adelaide saw and interpreted his confusion. ' He means the Duke of Wellington,' she whispered. William overheard, and half raised his head. ' Yes, the Duke of Wellington\u2014 the Iron Duke ! Tell my niece to trust him. Loyal \u2014 a loyal English gentleman ! ' He closed his eyes for a minute, but reopened them as the"], [138, "' GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ! ' 128 document he had spoken of was brought into the room. Taking in his enfeebled singers the pen which his wife handed to him, he scrawled the trembling signature for the last time \u2014 ' William IV. R.' Then he closed his eyes once more, and leant his head forward on the bosom of the Queen, as she bent over the couch. Teddy stood watching the pathetic scene, till the loud ticking of a clock in the corner of the room recalled him to the mission he had to discharge. He took the royal instrument reverently from the coverlet, on which it had fallen, and was stepping softly to the door, when he was arrested by a stir in the room. He turned round, and saw that the Archbishop had dropped on his knees. William the Fourth was no more. A doctor stepped hastily forward, and felt the dead man's heart. He turned round, and bowed his head. Immediately a tall stately man, in whom Hervey recognised the Lord Steward of the Household, advanced from the end of the room to the foot of the bed, carrying a white wand. He raised the wand above his head and solemnly broke it in two, pronounc ing these words in a loud voice : ' Thus it hath pleased Almighty God to take out of this transitory life, unto His divine mercy, the late most high, most mighty, and most excellent monarch, William IV., by the grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, and Sovereign of the most Noble Order of the Garter ; King of Hanover, and Duke of Brunswick and Lunenburgh.' Leaving the stricken Queen to weep over her husband's body, the awed lieutenant crept out quietly into the next room. Here he was immediately joined by the Marquis of Conyngham. 'I have ordered a carriage and pair to be got ready without an instant's delay,' said the Lord Chamberlain. 'The Arch bishop and I propose to drive at once to Kensington, to acquaint the Princess with the news. It will be best that you should come with us, and you can go straight on to Apsley House.'"], [139, "A RACE FOR A CROWN 129 ' I thank you, my lord,' said Teddy, bowing. ' But you will pardon me if I remind you \u2014 there is no longer a Princess. The King is dead,' he added solemnly ; and then, raising his eyes with a new light in them, he exclaimed : ' Long live Queen Victoria ! ' f."], [140, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 130 CHAPTER XIII THE IRON DUKE The arrangements were made with haste, with haste that might have seemed indecent if the necessity had been less urgent. Within ten minutes after William IV. had drawn his last breath a closed carriage and pair rolled out of the gate of Windsor Castle, and went at a rapid pace down the hill and out into the London road. To guard against any possibility of trouble from the head of the conspiracy, Lord Conyngham had put firearms into the carriage, and had ordered a soldier in plain clothes to mount on the box. But these precautions were unnecessary. Ex hausted by his fierce ride, and believing his adversary was safely disposed of for some time to come, Sturmer had gone to a small house in a back street of Windsor, just under the Castle walls, and was there taking a troubled sleep. The carriage, containing the Archbishop, Conyngham, and Hervey, passed unmolested across the bridge, through the main street of Eton, and on towards the metropolis. Meanwhile, under the Chamberlain's directions, the strictest precautions were being taken inside the Castle to prevent the news transpiring before the messengers had had time to reach Kensington Palace and concert measures with their new Queen against the rival claimant to the throne. The sentries were doubled, with orders to fire on anybody attempting to elude them, no one was allowed to leave the precincts of the Castle, and even within the Castle itself everything possible was done to keep the secret from spreading among the menials."], [141, "THE IRON DUKE 131 But such precautions are usually vain. Momentous news that affects the fate of kingdoms has a way of making itself known through a hundred mysterious channels. And the sentinels on duty at the gates never observed a stealthy form that crept along the wall, and dropped a folded paper over at a point opposite the house in which the Duke of Cumberland's agent was snatching his brief repose. It was on the point of half-past two when the carriage containing the heralds of a new reign passed down the steep slope of Windsor and out into the darkness of the country. As they drew near Hounslow a faint red flush upon the sky in front of them proclaimed the rising day. And the bright golden orb had cleared the roofs and spires of London as the smoking horses drew up at last at the gates of the Palace Hervey had quitted less than six hours before. During the long drive the three inmates of the carriage had discussed what steps to take on their arrival. As the result it was agreed that the Archbishop and Lord Chamberlain should alight at Kensington and rouse the royal maiden, while Hervey went straight on to the Duke's, to take his advice and solicit his powerful intervention. It seemed wonderful to Teddy that he had not thought of appealing to the hero of Waterloo before. It was true that at this moment the Duke of Wellington held no official status in the kingdom, unless his position as leader of the Conservative peers could be so called. It was equally true that his political career had deprived him of all influence and popularity with the lower orders of the nation. But the fidelity of the lower orders to the new sovereign was already assured. It was precisely that party of which the Duke and Sir Robert Peel were the chiefs whose support it was necessary to secure for the young monarch, because it was only their allegiance that was doubtful. Above all, the Duke's name and example would be paramount with the army. Although he had resigned the command of the forces some years before, in order to take office as Prime Minister, he could not divest himself of that authority and reverence which attach to the name of a great commander in the minds of the soldiers whom he has led to k 2"], [142, "I32 'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' victory. Teddy recalled the significant references to the Duke in the memorable conversation he had overheard in the Throne Room. The conspirators evidently hoped that the Duke would stand neutral, but they had clearly recognised that his influence would be decisive with the men on whom they most relied. The old King had judged rightly. It was in the Duke's hands that the fate of the monarchy rested at this crisis. When the carriage reached the principal entrance to Ken sington Palace, the two dignitaries got out, and the Lord Chamberlain ordered the coachman to put himself under Hervey's orders, driving him in the first instance to Apsley House. He and the Archbishop then proceeded to rouse the sleeping household in the Palace, a task which proved to be no easy one. It was not till after repeated knocking and ringing that they gained admittance, and even then a long delay fol lowed before they could induce the servants to rouse their young mistress. In the end, Lord Conyngham was obliged to reveal, in oblique language, the news which he had wished to reserve for Victoria's own ear. ' Tell the Queen that we are here to see her on business of State, which will brook no delay,' he said, with stern emphasis. And the astonished attendants this time really did convey the message. Before another five minutes had elapsed the door opened to admit the fair young sovereign, fresh from her untroubled slumber, and still clad in her white sleeping dress, with a shawl thrown across her beautiful shoulders. With eyes filled with tears, yet with a graceful self-posses sion that surprised these men grown old in Courts, she received the homage of her two distinguished subjects, and listened to their brief account of her uncle's last hours. She only interrupted the story to say, with exquisite modesty \u2014 ' Be seated, gentlemen, if you please. I have not yet learnt to see my seniors standing in my presence.' ' Now, Madam,' said the Marquis, as soon as the recital"], [143, "THE IRON DUKE 133 was finished, ' it is necessary to take steps at once, so that your enemies, when they hear of the late King's death, may find you already reigning in his stead. Will you allow me to des patch a trustworthy person to fetch the Prime Minister ? And I venture, to advise that you should at once sign an order to the Clerk of the Privy Council, directing him to summon the Council here forthwith. The young Queen listened thoughtfully. ' I wish you to send for Lord Melbourne, by all means,' she replied. ' But is it well that I should order the Council to be summoned before I have consulted him ? ' The Archbishop answered the question. \u2022 I understand your Majesty's scruple. But in this case I think you are justified in not waiting for the Premier. On a demise of the Crown, the Privy Council becomes for the moment the supreme authority in the realm, superior even to the Ministry, and I venture to think you ought at once to place yourself in its hands.' ' I will be responsible for the step, if your Majesty acts on my advice,' added the Lord Chamberlain earnestly. ' I take it on myself to explain the necessity to Lord Melbourne.' Victoria bowed her head. ' You may prepare the order, my lord. I will sign it.' While Lord Conyngham was attending to the despatch of the two messengers, one to the Prime Minister, the other to the Clerk of the Council, Mr. Greville, the Archbishop explained to the Queen that Hervey was already on his way to Apsley House to enlist the support of the Duke. Again the young monarch exhibited symptoms of hesitation. \u2022 Do you think that the Prime Minister will approve of that proceeding ? ' she asked. ' I have no reason to doubt it, Madam. I trust and believe that at such a crisis party feeling may be laid aside for the moment, and your Ministers will welcome the support of every one who can assist in strengthening the throne.' ' And the Duke himself; what do you think he will do ? ' The prelate looked grave. ' That, Madam, we can only know when Mr. Hervey returns."], [144, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 134 His late Majesty trusted in the Duke, and I am inclined to do the same.' The question asked by the Queen was the same one that Teddy put to himself as he stood at the door of Apsley House in the bright cold morning, and glanced first at the fresh verdure of the empty Park, and then down the silent pavement of Piccadilly, where one or two stragglers could be seen in the distance, returning from some all-night festivity. What would the Duke do ? Would he refuse to interfere between the two candidates for the crown \u2014 refuse to help a Government which he disliked and distrusted to seat on the throne a monarch who was likely to become the buttress of their party ? The painful doubt was still agitating him as the door was slowly opened by a servant, whose looks proclaimed that he had not been long out of bed. ' I desire to see the Duke at once,' said the lieutenant. ' Will you ask his Grace if he can receive me ? Say I have come on business of State.' This announcement did not make much impression on the man. ' His Grace never receives any one so early as this,' he answered, scowling. ' You had better come again later.' Teddy flushed with anger. ' Go to your master instantly,' he thundered, ' and tell him that I come straight from Windsor with a message from the King.' The servant drew back in some fright, and Teddy stepped resolutely inside the door. Then yielding sullenly to another fierce look from the lieutenant, the servant went off upstairs. In less than a minute he returned, his demeanour a good deal changed. ' Will you come this way, sir ? ' he said respectfully, and conducted the lieutenant straight into the Duke's presence. Teddy found the victor of Waterloo seated on a hard chair of the plainest fashion, before an equally plain writing-desk, in a small uncarpeted room, furnished principally with books. Early as it was, the master of the house had evidently been up some little time. His toilette was carefully made, and his"], [145, "THE IRON DUKE 135 chin showed that it had been freshly shaved. He laid down a paper on the desk as Teddy came in, and bent his eagle glance on the young man, with an expression at once inquiring and commanding. ' What is your name, sir ? ' he asked, the moment the servant had retired. As soon as Teddy had indicated his name and regiment, the Duke's air relaxed its severity. ' Take that chair, Mr. Hervey, and tell me your business.' Teddy felt that it was necessary to come straight to the point. ' The King died this morning, about two o'clock.' Wellington drew back his chair. ' Good God ! Dead ! ' He dropped his head for a minute, and concealed his face with his hand. His voice was perceptibly altered when he next spoke. ' This is sudden, sir. Have you anything more to tell me?' ' I was present during the last scene. Just before his Majesty died he signed this paper, which he charged me to deliver to your Grace.' Teddy handed the important instrument to Wellington, who received it impassively, and read it without moving a muscle. At the close he looked up. ' Well, sir ! ' ' The King also commanded me,' pursued Teddy, begin ning to feel rather discouraged by Wellington's manner, ' to say to your Grace that with his last breath he entrusted his niece to your care, and asked you to so deal by her that your last hour might be as peaceful as his.' This time the Iron Duke could no longer hide his emotion. His lip trembled, and a moisture glistened in his eye. ' I accept the trust,' he said in firm, distinct accents. ' And may my Maker deal by me as I deal by my Queen ! ' Teddy felt that the fight was won. The terrible nightmare of doubt and fear that had rested on his spirit during the last few days began to lift. Looking on that strong calm face he"], [146, "136 'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' breathed anew, with the same confidence that upheld the much-enduring squares through that long sabbath day, when the deadly artillery mowed its fearful way through the bleeding ranks, and the cuirassiers of France charged again and again. Wellington almost instantly resumed his stern business like tones. ' Do you know what made the King send me this message, Mr. Hervey?' ' It was in consequence of information which I myself took to the Castle last night,' replied Teddy. Without waiting for further questions, he briefly recounted all that he had discovered concerning the plot. When he came to the references to Wellington made by Sturmer in his discussion with the Marquis of Londonderry, the Duke frowned and made a movement. ' I am engaged to be at the Duke of Buckingham's to night,' he remarked. ' The fellows have been a day too late ! ' When Hervey touched on his interview with the Prime Minister, Wellington interposed another comment. ' Lord Melbourne is the one man in the kingdom who has most to hope from the Queen's accession, and yet he is the man who will do least to secure it. He is a weak man, Mr. Hervey, and in a statesman that is the worst fault of all.' The account of Lord Hill's refusal to interfere drew forth a smile on his old chiefs stern features. 'Afraid of responsibility \u2014 that was always Hill's failing. But he was the best general of division I ever had.' At the close of Teddy's recital Wellington sat for a few minutes without speaking. ' Who is with the Queen now, do you suppose, Mr. Hervey?' he inquired at last. ' Lord Conyngham, I imagine, and the Archbishop.' ' They will send for Melbourne, no doubt. Still we must do the best we can. You seem to have the Princess's \u2014 I should say the Queen's\u2014 confidence ; do you think you could obtain a private audience of her for five minutes ? ' ' I am almost certain of it.'"], [147, "THE IRON DUKE 137 ' Good.' The Duke looked at his watch. ' Six o'clock ! Your carriage is outside ? ' 'Yes.' ' Let us drive to the Palace at once.' Wellington led the way downstairs, and they went off, Teddy not venturing to ask what was in the Duke's mind. Half an hour later Ernest, Duke of Cumberland, was still asleep in bed, when a loud knock at the door roused him, and he opened his eyes to see Sturmer bursting in. The Baron's face was pale and haggard, and his bloodshot eyes glittered with an angry, troubled light. His hair was all in disorder, his clothes untidy and covered with dust, and his unshaven chin added to the wildness of his appearance. ' Quick, quick, sire ! ' he gasped out, panting. ' Rise at once ! There is not a moment to lose 1 ' At the word ' Sire,' Ernest started, and an eager look flashed in his eyes. 'My brother is dead?' he demanded, flinging back the bed-clothes. ' He died this morning at half-past two. Your Majesty is already King of Hanover, but if you would be King of Eng land too, you must exhibit yourself to our friends immediately.' ' When did you hear the news ? ' asked the King, beginning to dress himself without waiting to summon his valet. The sole emotion he evinced was anxiety. Of natural sorrow for V/illiam's death there was not a trace. ' Not till after three. I was at Windsor, I had gone there after young Hervey \u2014 you remember him, sire? I am afraid he is a very dangerous enemy. It appears they took the greatest pains to prevent the death being known in the Castle, but our agent managed to get a note over. I am afraid the others have got the start of us, though \u2014 I heard that a carriage had left the castle more than an hour in front of me, and no doubt by this time the Princess has been warned.' 'D you, Sturmer!' said the King, savagely. 'You promised that you would know before anybody else. They will be calling the Privy Council together by now.'"], [148, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 138 Hardly had the words escaped his lips when there was a fresh knock at the door. Sturmer went outside, and returned with a letter, sealed with the royal arms, and marked ' Urgent.' It was addressed 'To His Majesty the King of Hanover, Duke of Cumberland in the United Kingdom.' Ernest swore again as he tore the document open. The next minute a sarcastic smile crossed his lips. ' They have summoned the Council for eleven ! ' he cried in a tone of triumph. ' Evidently they suspect nothing. That gives us four hours clear. By then we ought to have seized Kensington Palace.' Sturmer nodded. ' We are fortunate,' he observed, with a sigh of relief. ' I will draft your proclamation while you ate dressing.' He looked round for ink and paper, but there were none in the bedroom. 'Go into my dressing-room,' said the King of Hanover, noticing what was the matter. 'I will be with you in two minutes.' The Baron obeyed. Passing through an inner door into the room indicated, he seated himself at a small writing-table, and commenced to draw up a document, beginning 'God save the King ! We, Ernest, by the grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith.' While he was thus engaged his master was hastily com pleting his toilette. He had just finished when the door was knocked on for the third time. ' Who is it ? ' he shouted, annoyed. ' In the Queen's name ! ' was the startling answer. And before Ernest had time to move or speak the door was thrown open, and the Duke of Wellington, followed by Hervey, walked into the room."], [149, "139 CHAPTER XIV A ROYAL REWARD The King of Hanover stared at the intruders, with a wrath which served to hide his secret dismay. ' My Lord Duke ! What is the meaning of this ? ' Wellington advanced a step towards him and held out a paper. ' I have brought you this instrument to sign, your Majesty,' he said, in firm though respectful tones. 'It is by the Queen's command,' he added, with emphasis. Ernest glanced over the paper, without taking it from the Duke. It was a formal renunciation of his claim to the British crown, followed by a solemn profession of allegiance to his niece Victoria. ' Take back your paper, sir. I refuse to sign.' Wellington bowed, like one who had anticipated the refusal. ' In that case I must do my duty. Ernest, King of Hanover, and Duke of Cumberland in the United Kingdom, in the name of Queen Victoria, I arrest you for high treason.' Ernest shook and a startled cry escaped him, as he fell back and had to cling to the bedstead for support. The blow was a crushing one. In a moment he beheld all his long cherished schemes and plots crumbling beneath him. At the sound of his master's voice Sturmer hastily emerged from the inner room, and turned even whiter than the King as he realised the situation. The Duke calmly produced a second paper, the ink on which was scarcely yet dry."], [150, "\u2022GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 140 'This is my warrant,' he said grimly ; ' the first her Majesty has been called on to sign. Now, sire, I must ask you to accompany me to the Tower. I have a guard of soldiers in attendance,' he concluded significantly. But these last words aroused a momentary gleam of hope in the two defeated plotters. Wellington observed the glance which passed between them, and divined what was in their thoughts. ' The guard is composed from men of Mr. Hervey's com pany,' he said with scornful intonation. 'Or rather Major Campbell's, who is personally in command.' Utterly crushed, Ernest sank into a chair. But the Hanoverian, of firmer temper than his master, spoke for him. 'You cannot touch his Majesty,' he said. 'As a foreign sovereign, his person is inviolable.' ' Sir,' said Wellington, ' I thought your case was that his Majesty was sovereign of this country. \u2014 Hold your tongue, sir,' he went on sharply, as the Baron seemed about to reply, ' I am not here to chop logic with you. I have my sovereign's orders, and I am not accustomed to go behind them.' The King of Hanover, who had listened eagerly to the brief debate, now made his own appeal. 'If I have ever behaved ungraciously to you, Duke, I apologise,' he said with a mixture of patronage and fawning. ' But surely you won't treat me like this at the bidding of a parcel of rascally Whigs ? ' ' Sire,' was the cold answer, ' your Majesty owes me no apology. As for what I am doing, I do it on my own respon sibility as a Peer and Privy Councillor, and, I hope, a loyal subject. May I order your carriage to be got ready ? ' The King cast a glance of despair at his confederate. But Sturmer's collapse seemed little less complete than his own. For the moment he was fairly beaten, and he knew it. ' Give me your paper,' said Ernest sullenly. ' I will sign.' ' I congratulate you, sire,' said Wellington, offering it for the second time. ' I may go into the next room, I suppose ? ' demanded the King haughtily."], [151, "A ROYAL REWARD 141 ' On your parole, yes, sire.' The King bowed, and retired, followed by Sturmer. ' Go on with the proclamation,' whispered the King, as he took a pen, and affixed his signature in large spluttering letters. ' This counts for nothing, because I do it under duress. Get our men together, and see what is possible to be done.' Sturmer nodded, and allowed his master to return to the bedroom without him. ' Here is the document, sir,' said the King, handing it to Wellington. 'Is that all?' ' My orders are to request your Majesty to accompany me to Kensington Palace, to take the oath as a Privy Councillor, and swear allegiance to the Queen, before the Council meets.' ' But this is keeping me under arrest ! ' ' It will be a strict secret, sire. No one will know of it but ourselves.' 'And this young gentleman,' said Ernest, giving the lieutenant a scornful glance. ' I will answer for Mr. Hervey as I would for myself,' said Wellington. And Teddy felt ready to burst with pride. The King of Hanover made no more demur, and walked down to his carriage, followed by the Duke. But Teddy lingered behind. He had observed that Sturmer had failed to reappear, and felt curious as to what had become of him. He crossed the bedroom softly, and peered through the door. The Hanoverian was seated, busily writing at the table. Teddy took the liberty of walking up to him, and looking over his shoulder. Before Sturmer had time to look round, his adversary had snatched away the half-finished proclamation, and was tearing it into fifty pieces. ' By heaven ! ' shouted Sturmer, hoarsely, as he sprang to his feet. ' You shall answer for this ! ' and he swore a fearful oath. ' No,' said Teddy, with a sarcastic smile, ' I cannot receive a challenge while I am on duty. Stay 1 ' he cried, as the other moved towards the door. ' I don't mean to let you out of my sight for the next twenty-four hours.'"], [152, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 142 Sturmer gave him a threatening look. But seeing that defiance was useless, he suddenly changed his tone. ' Mr. Hervey, we have been enemies ; we have fought, and you have had the best of it. My plans here are at an end, and all I care for now is to leave for Hanover as soon as possible. Will you let me go unmolested if I give you my parole to take no further steps on behalf of the King ? ' Teddy pulled out his watch. ' The Council meets at eleven. At twelve o'clock you may go.' ' Will you come with me to my own house ? ' asked the Hanoverian, seeing that the game was up. Teddy consented. As they issued from the Palace, how ever, he beckoned a couple of soldiers to follow them, and thus escorted they arrived in St. James's Square. Just as they reached Sturmer's house, and were about to ascend the steps, an over-dressed, vulgar-looking man, closely followed by a humbler companion, darted across the roadway from the railings in the centre, and planted himself in front of the Hanoverian. ' So, Mithter Thturmer, thith ith vot you promithed me, ith it ? ' he cried angrily. ' The Princeth ith Queen, after all, and your prethuth Duke ith off to Hanover, and my money with him. But at all eventh you than't ethcape me. Morrith, take the Baron'th body.' The bailiff stepped forward, and touched Sturmer on the shoulder. ' What is this ? ' asked Hervey in astonishment. ' It's a matter of fifteen thousand pounds, sir,' was the reply. ' It'th a thwindle, it'th a dathed infernal thwindle, that'th wot it ith ! ' cried the angry creditor. ' Thith man got my money by a cock-and-bull thtory that the Duke of Cumberland would be King of England, and now it ith all over London that the Princeth hath thuctheeded, and the Duke ith thtarting for Hanover.' Teddy was first puzzled, then amused, and finally relieved at this humiliating end to the Baron's career. ' I don't think I require your parole, after all, sir,' he said"], [153, "A ROYAL REWARD 143 with irony. ' It seems to me that this honest person is likely to be the chief sufferer from your plot.' Leaving the ruined wretch in the hands of his captors, he dismissed the escort and walked away westward. It is unnecessary to do more than glance at the rapid succession of events in Kensington Palace on this morning, so momentous in the history of England. Lord Melbourne was the first person to arrive, in response to the message sent by Conyngham, and he was at once received by the Queen in private audience, to which the Duchess of Kent was presently admitted. Later on the Duke of Wellington arrived with Hervey, who asked for Lady Fanny Greville. It was she who succeeded in bringing about a private interview between the Queen and the most illustrious of her new subjects. As soon as his young sovereign had expressed her gratitude for the Duke's loyal offers of assistance, he bluntly explained his views to her, and demanded a warrant to arrest her rebellious uncle. At first the Queen showed the same hesitation that Conyngham had observed in her to take any step without consulting the Prime Minister. It was by assuring her that the arrest of the King of Hanover would be a mere form, the threat of which would be sufficient, that Wellington finally carried his point. The subsequent interview between uncle and niece, in the presence of Lord Melbourne and the Duke, was an embarrassing one. But the King put the best face on the matter by stating that he had come voluntarily to put an end to what he described as the scandalous aspersions on his loyalty, by swearing allegi ance at the earliest possible moment. The oath was admi nistered to him by Melbourne in person, and it was agreed that, to cover up the transaction, the King should go through the form again, as if for the first time, when the Privy Council assembled. At eleven o'clock this was done, the Queen's other uncle, the Duke of Sussex, taking the oath at the same time. So ended, tamely and quietly, an attempt which had threatened"], [154, "'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!' 144 to shake the kingdom to its centre, perhaps to overturn the throne itself. It was not till the following day that Teddy secured half an hour alone with Fanny in her own room, adjoining the apart ments of the Queen. ' What do you think ! Her Majesty has promised that I am to be a Bedchamber Woman ! ' were the girl's first words. ' And Lord Melbourne has consented, because my brother has promised to give a general support to the Government in the House of Lords.'t Teddy tried to look pleased, but failed dismally. 'The Queen has promised me nothing,' he grumbled, 'and as my father hates Melbourne like poison, I'm not likely to get anything in any case. It seems to me that all this will remove you farther off from me than ever.' ' My dear Teddy, how disagreeable you are ! Any one else would be glad that I was going to be promoted, but you are as cross as possible.' ' I'm not cross, only unhappy,' said the lieutenant discon solately. ' Why ain't I a rich fellow like Campbell ? Then I could marry you to-morrow.' ' Perhaps I shouldn't have you then,' said Fanny in a low voice, turning away her head. Teddy went on complaining. ' What can I do ? I've no chance of ever being any better off, that I can see. There's no sign of a war, and if there were, they wouldn't send us out. I feel just useless. It would be better for me to sell my commission, and go out to one of these new colonies in New Holland.' Fanny came up to the young man, and laid her hand on his shoulder. ' I'm so sorry, Teddy. I didn't know you felt like that. But you mustn't say you are useless. You have just been of the very greatest use to the Queen herself, and I am sure she will remember it.' ' Never mind that ! I'm not thinking of queens, but of you. It seems so long to wait, and so hopeless, Fanny. Your mother will never consent.'"], [155, "A ROYAL REWARD 145 ' But I love you, Teddy,' whispered his sweetheart, putting a soft arm round his neck. ' Do you really, Fanny ? ' The conversation was fast threatening to become unin teresting and silly, when the lovers suddenly realised that they were no longer alone. A figure stood in the doorway, at whose appearance they both stood up in attitudes of profound respect. ' I don't wish to interrupt you,' said the Queen with a smile, ' but I haven't yet thanked you, Mr. Hervey, for the services \u2014 the very great services \u2014 you have rendered me.' ' I deserve no thanks, madam,' said Teddy, bowing, but with a certain disappointed ring in his voice. ' I simply did my duty.' ' It is not every one who does that,' was the mild answer. ' But I have been turning over in my mind what reward I could offer you as a mark of my gratitude.' ' Pray do not think I expect any reward. Your Majesty's gracious thanks are more than enough.' ' I think differently,' persisted the Queen. ' And what is more, I have fixed on a reward which I hope will be acceptable to you.1 Teddy began to feel curious. He raised his head, and watched the Queen's face. ' I may tell you that I have had to ask the consent of a person who has more to say in the matter than I have, and I have had a good deal of difficulty in gaining it.' Teddy's head drooped again. 'But I have gained it,' the Queen went on with quiet triumph. ' Do you think you can guess who the person is ? ' Lord Melbourne's was the name that rose to Teddy's lips. But he was too dispirited to speak it. He simply answered \u2014 i 'No, Madam.' The Queen smiled pleasantly. 'The Countess of Maldon.' ' Lady Maldon ! ' Teddy stared, bewildered, first at the Queen, and then at Fanny, who looked little less astonished than himself. t_"], [156, "' GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ! ' 146 ' Yes. You see the reward I intended for you is one of my Bedchamber Women, and she happens to be the Countess's daughter.' ' Your Majesty ! ' The young man flung himself on his knees before the Queen, the tears starting to his eyes. Fanny came and knelt beside him, and their young sovereign stood regarding them with a look of deep delight. Lady Maldon, in fact, had not been easy to manage.. Even the bribe of having her daughter included in the Royal Household had not been sufficient to overcome her resistance. It was not till the Queen, adopting a sterner tone, reminded the dowager of the efforts she had made to marry her daughter to Sturmer, and hinted that she would do well to clear herself of any suspicion of sympathy with the Hanoverian's traitorous designs, that the alarmed Countess gave way, and promised to make no further objection to the suitor favoured by the Queen. So ends the story, except that one year later, when the ruby- and sapphire-studded diadem of Britain was placed, in Westminster Abbey, upon the fair young brow of Britain's Queen, in the presence of such a splendid concourse as the world has scarcely gathered since, there were two persons in the throng of witnesses whose faces glowed with a more radiant joy than any others, two persons who, in fact, had just gone through a ceremony of their own, four hours before, in the adjoining church of Saint Margaret. So ends the story, with Major Campbell installed as chief friend of the young household, and perpetual godfather to a coming generation of Herveys ; with Sturmer dying in his debtor's prison ; with the new King of Hanover overturning the liberties of his subjects, as he had aspired to do those of England. So ends the story ; but, happily, not the auspicious reign of that young monarch, the magic of whose name still has power to-day to fill the streets with rejoicing millions, and to unite all creeds and parties in the universal cry \u2014 ' God save the Queen !
