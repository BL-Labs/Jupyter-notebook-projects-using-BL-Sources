During the last few years there has been a revived interest in the works of our elder poets ; more especially of those of the Elizabethan age, and the age immediately succeeding it. This interest has been brought about chiefly, pro bably, by the excellently edited reprints of such authors as Sidney. Raleigh, Marlowe, Herrick, and others. When, in 1847, the Rev. H. F. Lyte edited, for the Aldine Poets, the Sacred Poems of Henry Vaughan, Silurist, they had lain almost dead for the long period of nearly two hundred years. Nineteenth century lovers of the verse of this deep-thoughted and true poet, are there fore indebted to Lyte for his careful reprint of those poems. Vaughan is chiefly known and appreciated as a religious poet ; and it may be unknown to many of his admirers that he was the author of a substantial amount of secular verse, which, though not on the whole equalling in value his sacred productions, is, in part, of excellent quality, and at its best equalling the finest of the \" Sacred \" verses. To disengage these superior \" Secular\" pieces from the less valuable ones of their class has been the aim of the editor in preparing this"], [12, "PREFACE. VI volume, and he trusts that the results of his labour may meet a want among lovers of the literature of the seventeenth century. That the pieces here presented are worthy of a place beside Vaughan's Sacred Poems he has the utmost confidence in asserting. That there has been no reprint of these characteristic pieces in a handy and inexpensive form has been some what a matter of surprise to him. An edition of our worthy's complete poetical works should now meet with general acceptance among lovers of his Sacred Poems. Vaughan is generally classed with the school of George Herbert, and the general impression appears to be that he is inferior to the sweet singer of The Temple. Any one who will spend a little time in a careful study of Silex Scintillans, as well as of the pieces in the present publication, will, I venture to think, come to the conclusion that the Silurist shews a greater variety of subject, with some of the higher poetic qualities in excess of those shewn by the pious Herbert. He was certainly a greater lover and interpreter of Nature, and may not inaptly be called the Wordsworth of the seventeenth century. He is not always the ail but perfect artist that Herbert is (Vaughan has scarcely left a flawless poem), but he is certainly the greater in fine lines and phrases. A perusal of such pieces as The Eagle, To the River Usca, The Charnel House, To his Retired Friend, To the Best and Most Accomplished Couple, An Epitaph upon the Lady Elizabeth, and The Golden Age (a translation), will at least convince the reader of his various powers, and breadth of poetic range, in the field of his secular verse. His"], [13, "PREFACE. VII form may nearly always be said to be in keeping with his subject. His faults are those of his age. Says Lyte, speaking of the poems constituting Vaughan's Silex Scintillans, \"Pre serving all the piety of George Herbert, they have less of his quaint and fantastic turns, with a much larger infusion of poetic feeling and expression.\" A portion of this discriminating praise applies also to the non-sacred pieces. Those readers who wish to study the literature of this subject we would refer to the essays by Dr. John Brown {Locke and Sydenham), Dr. George Macdonald (England's Antiphon), Rev. Dr. Grosart ( Works of Vaughan), Principal Shairp (Sketches in History and Poetry), and Professor F. T. Palgrave ( Y Cymmrodor, Vol. XL,). Biographical details may be read in the \"Aldine\" edition of the \"Sacred\" Poems, and in Grosart's privately-printed edition of Vaughan's entire Works. To the last named edition of Henry Vaughan I am much indebted. Without it, it would have been almost impossible for modern students to have had any knowledge of the Silurist's secular poems. The original editions are of extreme rarity. Dr. Grosart in his reprint follows the spelling, and I believe the punctuation also, of the original editions. I have deemed it best to modernise the former, and in some cases, to correct the latter. In the present volume will be found new translations of three of Henry Vaughan's Latin Poems, and translations of two pieces by Thomas Vaughan, which had not, so far as I am aware, been put into English dress before."], [14, "PREFACE. VIII For the former I am indebted to the Rev. James Bell, of Hull ; and for the latter to the Rev. Canon Wilton, m.a., the author of Benedicite ; Sungleams ; Lyrics : Sylvan and Sacred, and other volumes of graceful and true poetry. The selection of Thomas Vaughan's Poems here given (pp. 56-66) will, I hope, be the means of drawing attention to one who, if he had cared to have further courted the Muses, might have made a name for himself as a Poet. Many of his verses are little inferior to those of his brother. I would draw the reader's special attention to the fine address to the Usk, and to the piece entitled Aelia L\u0153lia : Hyanthe. In conclusion, I have to thank my friend Mr. R. Curtin for his careful and substantial assistance in the transcription of a number of the poems. This aid, cheerfully rendered, has appreciably lightened my task, and in the absence of proper leisure for a labour of this kind, is all the more appreciated. J. R. T.

All flowers be here that earth's rich gardens bear, Her scattered likeness and lost image fair. The violet depicts her purple veins, The rose the tender hue her cheek that stains, Fair Nature paints my grief on every field, And bank and hedgerow Stella's tokens yield. The hyacinth thy special flower shall be, And lift its stalk and droop its head for thee : And as I mark its dewy cheeks I'll sigh, Mourning thy beauty as the years go by. To see thy matchless hands and lovely face The roses white and red I will embrace. Their flowers will serve as memories of thee, Their thorns, alas, all that is left to me.

October 6th, /S92."], [84, "NOTES. Biocraphical Note. \u2014 Henry Vaughan, styled \" Silurist,\" from the fact of his being a native of the country of the Silures in South Wales, was born about the year 1622, at Lower Newton on Usk, in Brecknockshire. Materials for a biography of the poet are extremely scant, despite the labours of Lyte and Grosart. The former contributed a judicious and appreciative introductory memoir to his edition of the \"Sacred Poems;\" while the latter, in his complete edition of Vaughan's Works, has given us a Life of him, shewing considerable original research and pains in the endeavour to obtain new facts. Our own remarks under this heading must be confined to a few leading facts. In 1638, the poet entered the University of Oxford. When he left, it is not known. He was an occasional visitor at the metropolis, and was a student of medicine. Having taken his diploma, he began to practice, about 1646, in his native county. Lyte tells us : \"he was twice married, and had, by his first wife, two sons and three daughters, and by the second, one daughter.\" For nearly half a century he followed his profession, living for the whole or the greater part of the time near Scethrog. He died in 1695, aged 73- For the Latin student and admirer of Vaughan we here append his autobiographical poem, Ait Posteros (\"To Posterity,\") which gives a picture of the natural surroundings of his birthplace, and a short sketch of his life and training. The latter half of the poem describes his feelings at the -calamities and perturba tions of the Civil Wars. Ad Posteros. Diminuat ne sera dies praesentis honorem Quis, qualisque fui, percipe Posteritas. Cambria me genuit, patulis ubi vallibus errans Subjacet aeriis montibus Isca pater."], [85, "NOTES, 69 Inde sinu placido suscepit maximus arte Ilerbertus, Latiae gloria prima scholae Bis ternos, illo me conducente, per annos Profeci, et geminam contulit unus opem, Ars et amor, mens atque manus certare solebant, Nee lassata illi mensve, manusve suit.

Pp. 1-4. To the River Usca.\u2014 This is probably the most beautiful of the non-sacred poems of Henry Vaughan. The stream ran by his own home, and on more than one occasion he sang its praises, as may be seen in the present volume. The little Latin poem, Ad Fluvium Iscam, and the translation of it, following this longer poem, continues the subject. The Silurist's brother has also an admirable poetical address to the same river. This also is given in the present volume (P- 56). Professor F. T. Palgrave \u2014 than whom there is no more sympathetic critic of poetry in general, and of the poetry of Vaughan in particular \u2014 says, in respect to the present poem: \u2014 \" Vaughan in this piece has caught something of the spirit of Milton's lovely song at the close of Comus, the one addressed to Sabrina \",( K Cymmrodor, vol. xi. , pp. 199-200). LI. 9-10. \u2014 The allusion here is to William Habington, whose collection of love verses, entitled"], [86, "70 NOTES. \"Castara\" (the poetic name of his lady), was published in Vaughan's time. L. 51. \u2014 Evet: the newt. P. 4. Ad Fluvium /scam. \u2014 A worthy appendage to the preceding poem. The concluding lines, in which our poet tells us he hears in the voice of the stream the plaints of the slain Thracian, are surely very note- worthy. Pp. 4-5. To the River Usk. \u2014 This English version of the little Latin poem has not been previously published, having been specially done for the present volume. It will be found to be a very close and literal rendering. LI. 5-8.\u2014 Cf. Tennyson (The Brook) :\u2014 \" For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever ;\" also Wordsworth (The Fountain) : \u2014 \" 'Twill murmur on a thousand years, And flow as now it flows.\" Pp. 5-7. The Eagle. \u2014 This is without doubt one of the very finest English poems on the bird. Tennyson's six-line fragment on the eagle cannot be compared with the present piece. Palgrave speaks of the \"strange visionary power\" of Vaughan's poem, and further remarks : \u2014 \" Vaughan's splendid exaggera- tions shine, as we may say, by the warm light of the imagination, not the white glitter of the intellect.\" The reader may like to compare this piece with Wordsworth's treatment of the subject in his three sonnets written at Dunolly Castle. L. 45. \u2014 Entertaiti : receive. P. 8. To Echo. \u2014 Another translation done expressly for this volume. Sir S. E. Brydges' sonnet, Echo and Silence \u2014 the last lines more especially \u2014 may be com- pared with lines 1-5 of the present poem. Pp. 9-11. The Chamel- House. \u2014 Dr. Grosart, in his Essay on the Life and Writings of He7iry Vaughan, speaks of this as \" the most Shakesperean of the Silurist's productions, that is, in single lines and"], [87, "NOTES. 71 epithets.\" We think this worthy lover of our poet is right in this, as a careful study of this deep-lhoughted production will convince the reader. L. 2. Kelder \u2014 It seems uncertain what meaning Vaughan intended in the use of this old word. Grosart suggests it may come from \" Kelde,\" to become cold ; or \" Kele,\" to cool. L. 13. Eloquent silence! \u2014 Cf. Sir Walter Raleigh (Historie of the World, Book v. , pt. i. ): \u2014 \"O eloquent, just, and mightie Death !\" L. 21. Air-monging \u2014 Dabbling, meddling. L. 46.

L. 31. \u2014 Dr. John Brown, in his essay on Vaughan, draws special attention to this line, which he considered as \"of great beauty.\" 19-21. To his retired Friend. \u2014 Lines 22 and 23 contain local allusions : \" the Crosse\" (vide Grosart) \" stood formerly in the market-place of Brecon,\" and the \"Shire-hall\" was the County Hall, which stood in the same town.

An Epitaph upon the Lady Elizabeth. \u2014 Professor Palgrave, in speaking of this most tender and beautiful poem, says : \" In all the poetry which, during the middle of the seventeenth century, touches upon the deaths and calamities of the time, I know none which rivals this elegy in depth of pathos, in reality of sentiment.\" {Y Cymmrodor, Vol. xi., p. 202). Crashaw has a fine poem ( To the Queen, upon her numerous progenie), in which are some lovely lines upon the subject of this Epitaph.

The Golden Age. \u2014 This is a translation of Metrum 5 of Lib. 2 of Boethius, and is probably the best representation of Vaughan's English versions of that classic author. [The following is inserted here as an additional felicitous example of Henry Vaughan's translations : \u2014 [ Translation of the Polish poet Casimir Serbievius' twenty- eighth Ode of Book IV.\\ Let not thy youth and false delights Cheat thee of life ; those heady flights But waste thy time, which posts away Like winds unseen, and swift as they. Beauty is but mere paint, whose dye With Time's breath will dissolve and fly ; 'Tis wax, 'tis water, 'tis a glass, It melts, breaks, and away doth pass. 'Tis like a rose which in the dawn The air with gentle breath doth fawn And whisper to, but in the hours Of night is sullied with smart showers. Life spent is wished for but in vain, Nor can past years come back again."], [90, "NOTES, 74 Happy the man ! who in this vale Redeems his time, shutting out all Thoughts of the world ; whose longing eyes Are ever pilgrims in the skies ; That views his bright home, and desires To shine amongst those glorious fires.] Pp. 45-55. Love Poems. \u2014 Many of our poet's earlier love verses have some of the faults of the bulk of the Erotic poetry of his day : they are artificial. He soon, however, became more natural, and there is true feeling underlying his later pieces of this class. A Song to Amoret (p. 45) is the very embodiment of noble and manly feeling. P. 45. A Song to Amoret, 11. 19-20. \u2014 A MS. copy of this in the British Museum furnishes the following variation of text : \u2014 \" But with my true steadfast minde None can pretend to vie.\" Pp. 46-47. \u2014 Upon the Priory Grove. \u2014 The \"Priory Grove \" is said by Grosart to have been at the \" Priory,\" Cardigan, the seat of James Philips, Esq., whose wife, Katherine, was one of the friends of Henry Vaughan. Pp. 47-49. Fida ; or, the Cotmtry Beauty. \u2014 This is one of our poet's later, and finer, love pieces. Professor Palgrave, remarking on lines 23-28, very dis- criminatingly observes : \" Often as the poets, in their gay flattery, have dwelt on the bright tresses of some beauty, and compared them to a net to catch the heart of man, or even Cupid himself, \u2014 I know none who have rendered the idea with more charming felicity\" (Y Cymmrodor,\\o\\. xi., p. 205). With lines 23-28 of this poem may be compared lines 15-20 of the one on St. J/ary J/agdalen, in second part of Silex Scintillans. LI. 63-65.\u2014 Cf. Fletcher {The Bloody Brother, Act v., Scene 2) : \u2014 \" Hide, oh, hide those hills of snow Which thy frozen bosom bears, On whose tops the pinks that grow, Are of those that April wears ! \""], [91, "NOTES, 75 Pp. 49-55. \u2014 Professor Palgrave (in Y Cymmrodor, vol. xi., p. 207), speaking of these poems on Etesia, says that Vaughan is here \"seen at his best in this style,\" and continues : \u2014 \" If he has not the finish, the airy touch of Herrick or Carew, he has a deeper sentiment, a more imaginative quality.\" Pp. 54*55- On Etesia Weeping. \u2014 This translation of the Latin poem /n Etesiam Lachrymantem is here printed for the first time, having been expressly done for this anthology. It will be found as literal as is consistent with poetic art. Biographical Note on Thomas Vaughan (\"Eugenius Phii.alethes.\") \u2014 Thomas Vaughan was the twin-brother of the Silurist, and at an early age he went to Oxford University along with his brother. There is no history of his University career. On his leaving Oxford he was presented with the living of his native parish, Llansaintfread. He was then in close proximity to his brother. At the close of the Civil Wars he lost his living, having been on the side of the King, and having even fought for him. On being ejected, he retired to Oxford, and spent the remainder of his life mainly there. \"He was,\" says Wood [A then. Oxon., ed. by Bliss, vol. hi.), \"a great chymist, a noted son of the fire, an experimental philosopher, a zealous brother of the Rosie- Crucian fraternity, an understander of some of the Oriental languages, and a tolerable good English and Latin poet.\" His patron was Sir Robert Murray, Secretary of State for Scotland. His end came February 27th, 1665, and it has been said that he was buried at Albury, but the registers of the place supply no informa tion on this point. (See the Silurist's pastoral elegy, Daphnis, 11. 113-116, which was written on his brother's death). His mystical writings, of which there are a large number, are studied even at this day. Dr. Grosart, in his \"Memorial-Introduction,\" names eleven separate publications by our worthy. Thomas Vaughan's poems, English and Latin, are very little known. From the selection here given, let the reader decide whether any of them were worthy of being reprinted. Pp. 56-57. To the Usk. \u2014 Compare with this the poem by the Silurist (pp. 1-4) addressed to the same river."], [92, "76 NOTES. LI. 17-18. \u2014 These lines are an anticipation, as Grosart points out, of the following \u2014 On the Thames \u2014 in Sir John Denham's Cooper's Hill: \u2014 \" O could I flow like thee, and make thy stream My great example, as it is my theme !

Pp* 57-59* Aelia L\u0153lia: Hyanthe. \u2014 LI. 19-40 may be compared with Crashaw's treatment of the same subject \u2014 a lady weeping. There are several points of resemblance, and both poets in dealing with this subject were fond of conceits.

His Works were published 1857-1860, and the best life of him is that in Hook's Archbishops of Canterbury. 64-65. Epitaph of William Laud. \u2014 This translation of the Latin Poem has not previously been published, having been done specially for the present publication, by one who is well known and appreciated as the translator of many of the Latin productions of George Herbert, Richard Crashaw, and other old English Poets. 66-67.
