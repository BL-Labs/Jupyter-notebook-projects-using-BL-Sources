In presenting tins slight brochure to the public, the Author ventures to beg their indulgence, not on the usual ground, of the rapidity with which the Poems have been written, but on account of the great care and labour which be has bestowed on them, rendering them as worthy of their notice as lay in bis power. That be has failed signally in his attempts to perfect them is no doubt quite true, but yet he has done all that he could to contribute to the amusement of the public, and on that ground, if on no other, deserves some kindness at their hands. Although the author has struck out many lines as pla giarisms, in re-writing the Poems that follow, previous to their publication, still in all probablity, many more remain, and for these he sincerely hopes the reader will forgive him ; remem bering that there is scarcely one single line, of even the greatest poet of the present age, to which one similar in form or in idea, may not be adduced from earlier authors."], [8, ""], [9, "CONTENTS.

The facts of the ensuing Tale are as follows -. \u2014 Alfred G. arrived in India in the year 13 \u2014 , and for two years occupied himself in travelling in Bengal and Upper India. Being a perfect master of most of the Native dialects, he became acquainted with a young Rajpoot, who was engaged to be married to a Persian girl, whose parents having migrated from their native land, died and left her an orphan, at the mercy of strangers. The uususpecting Rajpoot introduced his friend, contrary to the cus- tom, to his fiancee, and soon after this, was compelled to travel to a considerable distance, to perform his father's funeral rites. His friend took advantage of his absence to seduce his bride, and carry her off. Time passed on, and the European grew tired of his Indian mistress, and forsook her ; the poor girl drowned herself. Not long after G. married, but was murdered in the arms of his bride on his wed- ding night. These are the facts.
