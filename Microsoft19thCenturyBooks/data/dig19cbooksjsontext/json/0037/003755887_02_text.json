CHAPTER XXIII. CAMPAIGN IN EAST TENNESSEE AND MINOR OPERATIONS LN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND. General Burnside had been informed that he should have help as soon as practicable, when first it was known that Gen eral Longstreet had been sent against him. General Grant said to him that he could hardly conceive the necessity of re treating from East Tennessee. But as the issue at Chatta nooga, though glorious in its coming, had been delayed, it became imperative at once to make effort to raise the siege of Knoxville. November 29th, General Howard marched from Parker's Gap to Cleveland, taking the lead in the movement upoD Knoxville. He was followed immediately by General Sher man's three divisions, under General F. P. Blair, and General Davis' division of the Fourteenth Corps. On the 30th, Gen eral Granger left Chattanooga with two divisions of the Fourth Corps for the same destination. Brigadier-General Elliot, who had recently been appointed chief of cavalry in the Department of the Cumberland, and who had concentrated the troops of his first division at Sparta, moved in conjunction with the infantry forces. Colonel vol. n \u2014 1"], [16, "2 CAMPAIGN IN EAST TENNESSEE, ETC Long's brigade moved to the head of the column, and on the 2d of December, the Fifteenth Pennsylvania and Tenth Ohio Cavalry left Chattanooga *br Kingston. Colonel Spears' bri gade, that had been previously stationed on the north bank of the Tennessee river above Chattanooga, also moved toward Knoxville. General Sherman's command embraced more than eight divisions of infantry, while live were left to garrison Chattanooga. Supplies for the troops in motion were sent up the river on the steamer Dunbar, but the main dependence was upon the country. On the 30th, General Howard advanced from Cleveland to Charleston, on the Hiawassee river. As he approached the town, the enemy's cavalry retreated toward Athens. They had previously partially destroyed the railroad bridge, and had made effort to destroy the pontoons also. But a large num ber of the boats were saved, and during the following night the railroad bridge was repaired and planked over, so that in the morning the Eleventh Corps passed over, followed by the rear forces. The head of column reached Athens the next evening. The march of the infantry was resumed on the 2d and Colonel Long hurried on to Loudon to save the bridge, if possible. He, however, found the enemy in such force that he could not make a dash, as had been anticipated. The town was well fortified, and was held by infantry and artillery, un der General Vaughan, and he could only skirmish until Gen eral Howard should get up. The latter reached the position on the 3d, but the enemy had evacuated it the night previous, having first destroyed the bridge, three locomotives, and from sixty to seventy-five cars containing commissary stores, cloth ing, and ammunition. The pontoon bridge had also been partially destroyed. Notwithstanding the immense destruc tion of supplies, three days' rations were found uninjured. From this point, Colonel Long was sent with picked men to communicate with General Burnside. On the 4th, Colonel Hecker's brigade crossed the river, skirmished with the cav alry, and took possession of four rifled cannon, which the enemy could remove, and captured a flag. Here General Howard found about thirty wagons partially destroyed, which he repaired for use in forming a temporary bridge,"], [17, "CAMPAIGN IN EAST TENNESSEE, ETC. 3 in anticipation of crossing the Little Tennessee river at Davis' ford. The route by this ford was not the one which had been designated, but it was ascertained that time could be saved, and the march shortened by advancing upon it rather than upon the road to Morgantown, aud General Sherman permit ted General Howard to use it. Before leaving Loudon, General Howard received an order io command the left wing of the army, while the center and righ twere placed respectively under Generals Granger and Blair. These divisions of the army were to act independently, but to march to each other's support when called by the noise of battle. December 5th, General Howard crossed the Little Tennes see river, at Davis' ford, by means of an extemporized bridge formed of wagons and movable trestles, and reached Louis ville at dark. At night, the three heads of column communi cated at Marysville. Here information was received that Longstreet had raised the siege of Knoxville, and retreated eastward. He assaulted Fort Sanders, the key to the position, on the 29th, and was repulsed with heavy loss. Aware, sub sequently, of the proximity of Sherman's army, he sought safety in timely retreat. All the forces were now ordered to halt, and the day following, General Sherman met General Burnside at Knoxville. It was then agreed that the Fourth Corps should remain and the other forces return to Chatta nooga. The countermarch was commenced on the 7th. A halt was made at Athens, with the various columns so disposed as to cover a movement of Colonel Long, who had gone toward North Carolina to cut off one of Longstreet's trains. Upon his return, the infantry forces marched to Chattanooga. How ard's corps and Davis' division resumed their old relations in the Army of the Cumberland, and Sherman'sdivisionsreturned to the \"West. Though the march to East Tennessee involved no serious fighting with Longstreet's command, which was lost to Gen eral Bragg in his emergency at Chattanooga, it nevertheless thoroughly accomplished its object, as it forced the former from Knoxville toward the East, in what proved to be per-"], [18, "4 CAMPAIGN IN EAST TENNESSEE, ETC. petual separation from the Confederate Army of the Tennessee. It was a hard march, as the troops commenced it immediately after a series of engagements, and Sherman's forces after a long march from the West. The latter had \" stripped for the fight \" at Bridgeport, and they, with many from other com mands, were destitute of suitable clothing for a winter cam paign. Besides, their supplies were drawn mainly from the country, and in a hurried movement this source is exceed ingly precarious. Supplies were sent up the river in boats it is true, but the army was not always near the river; and, on the whole, the circumstances were such as none but veteran soldiers would easily overcome. The mills were seized in ad vance, and run night and day ; and a broad belt of country in the march and countermarch paid exhaustive contributions. There were some excesses which were reprehensible, especially as the march was through a region whose inhabitants were mainly loyal. General Davis' division, by its order on the march and its restraint from pillage, elicited special praise from General Sherman. In this commendable and conspicu ous bearing, this division represented the Army of the Cum berland, which, throughout its existence, was systematically restrained from pillage and irresponsible foraging. The objects now were to hold all the territory which had been gained, to maintain and perfect communications, rein force, recuperate, and reorganize the army, and accumulate supplies and material, all looking to offensive movements, as early as practicable. The enemy was in no condition for ag gression on a grand scale, but great vigilance and skillful dis positions were necessary to maintain communications and pre vent cavalry raids and guerrilla depredations. Upon the withdrawal of the troops from Ringgold, General Hooker resumed the occupation of Lookout valley. General Crust was directed, with his two brigades, to stop on the way and bury the national dead on the battle-field of Chicka mauga,* and then to take position on the railroad between * War's visage, despite the glory of heroism and victory, and all the gentle courtesies which enemies may extend at all times, except when the rage of battle brooks no restraint, is grim and forbidding; but when the ordinary usages of civilized and Christian nations in the conduct of"], [19, "CAMPAIGN IN EAST TENNESSEE, ETC. 5 Whitesides and Bridgeport. Colonel Watkins' brigade of the First division of cavalry was directed to take post at Ross ville; and the Ninety-second Illinois Mounted Infantry was sent to Caperton's ferry, to guard and observe at that point. A pioneer brigade, composed of detachments from various regiments, Colonel G. P. Buell commanding, was employed in the construction of a double-track macadamized road over the nose of Lookout Mountain, to serve as a communication between Lookout valley and Chattanooga, without depend ence upon pontoon bridges. Beyond this primary use, this road was essential to overland communications with Bridge port. The repair of the railroad commanded immediate atten tion, but as two long and high bridges were to be built \u2014 one iwer the Tennessee river at Bridgeport, and the one over Fall ing Water, near Whitesides \u2014 much time was required. When the army returned from East Tennessee, the Eleventh Corps went into camp at Whitesides ; two brigades of Davis' division, east of Missionary Ridge, near Bossville ; and the third at the mouth of the North Chickamauga. General Elli ott was ordered to establish his headquarters at Athens, and post pickets at Calhoun, Columbus, and Tellico Plains. During the months of November and December, there were several brilliant contests in resisting the enemy's cavalry, re pressing guerrillas, and scouting to the front to ascertain the strength and movements of the enemy. And in most cases the national troops were victorious. November 2d, Brigadier-General R. S. Granger, command- war are ignored, then are its features forbidding in the extreme. The car nage and suffering are appalling when cool reflection and the kindly sympathies have play ; but all strong terms are inadequate to express the wanton barbarities of war, either in cruelty to the living or dishonor to the dead, and on both counts the leaders of the rebellion must be con victed. Andersonville and other prisons, where starvation and want of room for captives entailed the intensest suffering and fearful mortality, and Chickamauga, with its hundreds of unburied dead, give proof of the most revolting inhumanity. General Bragg accepted an exchange of pris oners who were wounded, but he denied burial to multitudes of the slain. The national dead upon that part of the field occupied by General Long street were buried; but very many on their right, where General Polk \u25a0commanded, lay upon the ground for two months."], [20, "6 CAMPAIGN IN EAST TENNESSEE, ETC. ing at Nashville, sent a mixed command, under Lieutenant- Colonel Sculley, First Middle Tennessee Infantry, to look after Hawkins, and other guerrilla chiefs, near Piner's fac tory. Sculley met them, and having routed the party, pur sued to Centerville. At this point, as he was crossing the river, Hawkins attacked in turn, but was again routed, and his partisans were dispersed. His loss was from fifteen to twenty killed, and sixty-six prisoners. November 4th, Major Fitzgibbon, of the Fourteenth Mich igan Infantry, fought near Lawrenceburg the guerrilla bands of Cooper, Kirk, Williams, and Scott. After a hand-to-haud contest, Fitzgibbon defeated them, killing eight, wounding seven, and capturing twenty-four men. Among the captured were a captain and two lieutenants. The victor had three men slightly wounded, and eight horses killed. On the 13th, Captain Cutler, with one company of mounted infantry from the garrison at Clarksville, and a section of Whitniore's battery, had a contest with Captain Gray's com pany of guerrillas, near Palmyra. He killed two, wounded five, and captured one. The same day, fifteen prisoners were captured near Lebanon, and forty by Missener, near Columbia. Ou the 16th, General Payne sent parties from Gallatin and La Vergne. Five guerrillas were killed, and twenty-six were captured, also horses, cattle, sheep, and hogs, which had been collected for the Confederate army. The next day, Colonel Coburn sent an expedition from Murfreesboro against the enemy's irregular cavalry. A de tachment of the Fourth Tennessee Cavalry captured nineteen guerrillas and twenty horses, without loss. On the 21st, an expedition was sent down the Tennessee river, which destroyed nine boats for local use, some of them being sixty feet long. They were wrested from the enemy. On the 26th, the First Tennessee Cavalry and Ninth Penn sylvania Cavalry, under Colonel Brownlow, attacked Colonel Murray, at Sparta. He killed one man, wounded two, and captured ten. Extensive salt-works were destroyed, and some horses and ammunition were taken. The same day, Captain Brixie's scouts encountered a party"], [21, "7 CAMPAIGN IN EAST TENNESSEE, ETC. of guerrillas near Bathsheba Springs, capturing fifteen or twenty, and dispersing the remainder. December 12th, Colonel Watkins, with two hundred and fifty men, from the Fourth and Sixth Kentucky Cavalry, made a dash upon Lafayette, Georgia, and captured a colonel of the Georgia home guard, six officers of the signal corps, and thirty horses and mules, and returned to his camp at Rossville, without loss. On the 27th, the colonel sent Major Willing, with one hundred and fifty men from the same regiments, to McLemore's Cove and Lafayette. The major captured one lieutenant, sixteen men, and thirty-eight horses and mules. On the 15th, General Dodge captured a small party of cav alry, under command of Major Joe Fontaine, General Roddy's adjutant, not far from Pulaski, Tennessee. This party had made a reconnoissance on the Nashville and Chattanooga and Nashville and Decatur railroads, which doubtless had some relation to projected movements or raids. It suggested greater vigilance along these important roads. December 27th, General Wheeler, with fifteen hundred men, appeared at Calhoun, Tennessee, with evident expecta tion of capturing a train under escort of Laiboldt's brigade. Colonel Laiboldt charged this force, and routed it speedily, and Colonel Long, with one hundred and fifty men, having come from the opposite side of the river, in support, moved in pursuit, believing that a small force had been cut off from the main body. By a saber charge, this force was scattered in all directions. One hundred and thirty-one prisoners were taken, including five officers, one a division inspector and one a surgeon. The number of killed and wounded was not as certained. Colonel Long lost two killed, twelve wounded, and one missing. Wheeler commanded in person, and an ticipated rich booty with slight trouble, but failed in his object, with heavy loss."], [22, "8 CHAPTER XXIV. GENERAL VIEW OF THE STATUS OF THE CONFLICT AT THE CLOSE OF 1863. The year 1863 was crowded with disaster to the insurgents. They were victorious in some of the great battles in Virginia, but lost fearfully in the battle of Gettysburg. So that, at the East, where only they had been at all successful, their strength was relatively less than at the beginning of the year. In the West, their losses in men, material of war, and territory were immense. In their effort to maintain their hold upon the Mis sissippi river, they lost two armies, and when subsequently the \" Father of Waters \" flowed \" unvexed to the sea,\" and the supremacy of the national navy upon this great river and its tributaries was unquestioned, all contiguous portions of the insurgent states were at the mercy of the national armies. At the close of the year the central offensive line was resting upon the northern limits of Alabama, Georgia, and North Car olina. The loss of so much territory, the complete division of what remained by the navy moving at pleasure upon the Mississippi river, and the immense diminution of men and means, gave new conditions to the campaigns of the next year. Besides the effect of numerous defeats during the year, two proclamations of the President of the United States greatly alarmed the insurgents. On the 1st day of January, 1863, he proclaimed freedom to all the slaves in the revolted states, and in the last month ' he promised pardon to all below a given grade, in the insurgent armies. As a sequence of the freedom of the slaves, and as a war measure of great moment, arms were soon put in their hands."], [23, "GENERAL VIEW AT THE CLOSE OF 1863. 9 At first, however, the enrollment of the freedmen as soldiers was only occasionally undertaken by individual department commanders in absence of any general plan or explicit author ity from Washington. Though slavery directly and indirectly was the dominant cause of the war, there was manifest reluc tance for nearly three years to lay hands upon it, and after its abolition was decreed, the national authorities hesitated to make soldiers of those whose bondage they had broken. The slaves had aided the enemy not only by their productive labor, but also by the construction of defenses, and contributed to the strength of the rebellion in greater measure, than they had previously given political weight to the Southern States, in Congress. The more moderate and far-seeing men of the South anticipated, from the first, that sooner or later the African race would be involved in the war. And later than many of this class anticipated, and a growing party in the North demanded, the President pronounced the freedom of the negroes in the seceded states. Their enlistment as soldiers was so plaiuly a legitimate consequent that it was not long delayed. Both measures were repugnant to the traditional and inveterate prejudices of the Southern people, and of many in the North as well. In the official utterances of the Confed erate President, the reprehension of the civilized world was invoked upon those who proposed these measures, and the total destruction of the Africans in America was predicted. But the argument in their support was so simple and forcible that serious opposition to either soon ceased in the North. As the slaves were a source of strength to the rebellion, the logic of war first declared them contraband, and then demanded their employment as soldiers. The fact that their freedom was contingent upon the overthrow of the Southern Confed eracy, not only justified their grasp of the musket, but enforced its obligation. Aud the results vindicated the policy, as colored regiments greatly augmented the national armies for the cam paigns of 1864. The President's offer of pardon to the masses in the Con federate armies, had marked effect. It gave assurance that peace could ensue without the entailment of penal criminality upon those in arms against the government below the rank of"], [24, "GENERAL VIEW AT THE CLOSE OF 1863. 10 brigadier-general, and hence removed the necessity that mere desperation should keep them under the standards of treason. And as this promise of amnesty involved no hard conditions, and was made at a time of general despondency in the South, and when such was the depreciation of Confederate money, that no poor man could give even partial support to a family from his pay as a soldier, it prompted numerous de sertions. Desertion being added to the drain of active cam paigns, the diminution of the insurgent armies became alarming to the leaders. But they still claimed that the independence of the Southern States was assured, and on this ground, in part justified a conscription of widest compass. The people did not bear this patiently. Murmurs of discontent became gen eral. Occasionally there was open protest and severest criti cism. But as nothing but counter-revolution could remedy the evil, and as this step plainly led through anarchy to sub mission to the general government, the relentless conscription of young and old, and the sweeping appropriation of private property was endured. As a result, sullenness and discour agement took the place of cheer and hope in their armies, and outward restraint rather than moral force kept multitudes in the ranks ; while the certainty of pardon, in the event of the failure of the rebellion, induced those not ready to desert to weigh the cost of protracting a contest when success was ex tremely doubtful. But the leaders, after a year of gigantic reverses, standing upon the threshhold of new campaigns with diminished armies, as boldly as ever declared that subju gation was impossible. President Davis, in his annual mes sage to his congress, announced that \" grave reverses had be fallen the Confederate armies,\" and that the hope of a speedy termination of the war, entertained at the beginning of the year, had not been realized, and yet asserted that peace could only come with the acknowledgment of the independence of the Confederate States. Even after General Lee's defeat at Gettysburg, the fall of Vicksburg and Port Hudson, and the retreat of General Bragg's army over Cumberland Mountains, M. T. Maury assured the world, in a paper published in the \" London Times,\" that the prospect of success to the South was brighter than at any former period of the war. Whether"], [25, "GENERAL VIEW AT THE CLOSE OF 1863. 11 this assurance was real or assumed, on the part of the leaders, and whether they had to any great extent the sympathy of the masses in their avowed hopes, such was the power of the Confederate government and the momentum of the rebellion, that armies of fair defensive proportions were maintained, and some of the Southern generals even entertained projects of aggression. The events of the year as affecting the national cause, viewed from a military or political stand-point, were cheering in the extreme. The victories of the national armies and the support of war measures as evinced by the elections, equally indicated that the crisis of the nation's destiny had been safely passed. The strength of the rebellion had culminated, and the general situation gave encouragement to the government and those who supported it, to strike blow after blow until the final one should be given. The elections declared the nation's approval of the President's proclamation of freedom to the slaves, and the pol icy of making them soldiers, and universal freedom was now as firmly established as a condition of peace as the surrender of the Confederate armies. The maintenance of the full strength of the national armies was now the grand problem. The term of enlistment of very many regiments would expire early in 1864. Their re tirement during active operations would endanger the success of all plans of aggression which might be formed. In fact, the speedy suppression of the rebellion turned upon their re tention in the service, and yet there was no law to hold them. Fortunately for the country her citizen soldiers were equal to the emergency, and their voluntary re-enlistment, more strin gent drafting, and the enrollment of the freedmen, gave prom ise of adequate armies. It was evident at the close of the year that the Army of the Cumberland was again to confront its old enemy, the Army of the Tennessee. After its defeat at Chattanooga, this army took position at Dalton, with a heavy detachment at Buzzard's Roost, and forces also at the strong positions between Dalton and At lanta. The Western and Atlantic railroad courses through the hills and mountains of Northern Georgia, which give marked advantage to an army acting on the defensive, against another"], [26, "12 GENERAL VIEW AT THE CLOSE OF 1863. dependent upou the railroad for supplies. And before the ex act character of the next central campaign could be determined, the Confederate generals exerted themselves to give additional strength to the fortresses which nature had provided. Whether they should be able to take the offensive or not, their past ex perience suggested the propriety of making provision for de fense as far to the rear as practicable, while maintaining a strong defensive front."], [27, "13 CHAPTER XXV. OPERATIONS IN THE DEPARTMENT DURING JANUARY, FEBRUARY, AND MARCH, 1864, AND PREPARATIONS FOR AGGRESSION. At the beginning of the year 1864, and during the first months of the year, the troops of the Army of the Cumberland were disposed from Knoxville to Bridgeport, and on the rail road from the latter place to Louisville, Kentucky. The atti tude of the army was mainly defensive. In fact, it was in no condition for aggression. At least ten thousand animals had died during the siege of Chattanooga, and those which survived were so reduced in strength as to be unfit for service. The army, too, was temporarily weakened by the absence of numer ous regiments that had been granted furloughs upon re-enlist ment ; and previous to the completion of the railroad between Chattanooga and Bridgeport, it was hardly possible to supply the troops at rest on the defensive line, including the Army of the Ohio in East Tennessee. Thus restrained from active op erations, its chief duty was preparation for future aggression. As the primary step, it was imperative to make Chattanooga a reliable proximate base of supplies for an army advancing toward Atlanta. The Confederate army being in winter-quar ters in Northern Georgia, could destroy all the productions of that region which it did not consume or transport. So that the accumulation of supplies at Chattanooga, and the continued maintenance of railroad communications with Nashville and Louisville, were conditions of a southward advance ; and the practicability of making Chattanooga a base for offensive op erations, hinged upon the capacity of a single railroad. Two railroads from Nashville meet at Stevenson, Alabama, but from their junction to Bridgeport, and thence to Chat-"], [28, "14 OPERATIONS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH, 1864. tanooga, there is only a single track. As the bridges at Bridge port and Falling Waters were not completed until the 14th of January, half the winter was gone before there was the slightest accumulation of supplies ; and though subsequently this single railroad was pressed to its utmost capacity, such were the im mediate wants of the armies, and so numerous were the vet eran regiments passing over the road, that the laige store houses which had been built at Chattanooga were very slowly filled. During the first half of January, the enemy was not active. General Thomas sent scouting parties in all directions, but no indications of aggression were discerned. Apart from the ex haustion which the preceding campaigns had produced, a change of commanders was doubtless one cause of inaction. Soon after his defeat before Chattanooga, General Bragg bad been removed from command in Georgia, and General Joseph E. Johnston, while charged with the administration of a mili tary division corresponding in extent to the one which had been created for General Grant, assumed personal command of the forces immediately south of Chattanooga. His presence at Dalton indicated his appreciation of the importance of the center of his line, either to regain what had been so recently lost, or to neutralize Chattanooga, as far as possible, as a base for aggressive operations. By this time, the foreshadows of the campaign which Gen eral Grant had projected began to appear. Mobile was his next objective, with Atlanta and Mongomery as important intermediate points.* Not being ready to advance upon the direct line to his objective, he proposed a movement from his right flank by General Sherman, while General Thomas should make effort to hold Johnston's forces at Dalton, and General Foster, commanding in East Tennessee in room of General Burnside, should neutralize Longstreet's army. The objects proposed for General Sherman were the destruction of the railroads from Vicksburg to Meridian, and the capture of Mobile, should its practicability be developed as he advanced. But before he was ready to move, rumors were current that * Statement of plan by General Badeau, in \"Life of General Grant.\""], [29, "OPERATIONS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH, 1864. 15 Longstreet was receiving reinforcements from Virginia. This deranged the plans with regard to the center and left. Gen eral Thomas was desirous of recalling his troops from East Tennessee, to be able to demonstrate strongly against Dalton ; but it now became necessary that he should have regard to the contingency of sending additional troops to General Foster. General Longstreet's attitude had been ambiguous since his abandonment of the siege of Knoxville, upon the approach of General Sherman, in December. His presence was a menace, even in absence of operations of direct offense ; and as it was possible for reinforcements to reach him from Dalton and from Virginia, an effort to regain the mountain fortresses of East Tennessee was probable, especially if General Johnston could entertain the hope of keeping the war out of Georgia by carrying it to the North. Any plan of aggression on his part would involve the possession of a route to the northeast of Chattanooga, and for a time such a course was plainly indi cated or feigned. When, on the 15th of January, General Wood advanced to Dandridge and drove the rebel cavalry from the town, an offensive return was provoked, which for a time threatened to change General Grant's plans very materially. Though Gen eral Wood was joined by General Sheridan's division and McCook's cavalry at Dandridge, it was not deemed safe to hazard a general engagement. For two clays there was skir mishing, and late in the afternoon of the 18th, there was a brisk conflict mainly between McCook's cavalry and Long street's advance. Three Ohio regiments \u2014 the First, Ninety third, and One Hundred and Twenty -fifth \u2014 were holding the front as pickets, and were severely pressed by a tentative ad vance of the enemy, but they fought bravely to cover the prep arations for a retreat. McCook, by a saber charge, cleared the field and captured two steel rifle-guns, and over one hun dred prisoners. This action and the darkness permitted the safe retreat of the national troops. They fell back, first to Strawberry Plains, and subsequently to Marysville, followed by Longstreet. Simultaneously with this movement, General Roddy crossed the Tennessee river near Florence, Alabama, with two brigades"], [30, "16 OPERATIONS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH, 1864. of cavalry. General Dodge, commanding troops of General Sherman's army at Pulaski, Tennessee, received information on the 20th, that he was preparing boats and concealing them with the evident purpose of crossing his command for a raid upon the railroads. General Grant at once advised General Thomas of the fact, and directed him to organize an expedi tion to drive Roddy back, and destroy his boats aud all ma terial which could be used in effecting the passage of the river. But he was across two days before these instructions were communicated, and General Thomas could only make arrange ments to defeat his purpose. He directed the detachments guarding the roads to watch against attacks, and ordered Gen eral Crook commanding cavalry at Huntsville, Alabama, to advance against Roddy and drive him across the river. Colonel H. 0. Miller, Ninety-second Indiana, commanding one expedition, defeated Johnson's brigade near Florence on the 26th, killing fifteen, and wounding and capturing a large number. Among the prisoners were three officers. His own loss was ten wounded. General Gillem also sent parties from the line of the Northwestern railroad against Roddy, as soon as he heard that he had crossed the river. These parties returned on the 30th with Lieutenant-Colonel Brewer, two captains, three lieutenants, and twenty men as prisoners. Hav ing thus met forces between him and the railroad in all di rections, Roddy recrossed the river, having effected no damage that compensated for his losses. January 27th, the cavalry under General Elliott, in a brilliant action at Mossy Creek, East Tennessee, defeated General Mar tin, commanding two divisions of cavalry, Morgan's and Arm strong's, and followed his routed forces until darkness ter minated the pursuit. Campbell's and La Grange's brigades were engaged, and they put the enemy to rout by a saber charge, capturing one hundred and twelve prisoners, including two regimental commanders and seven other officers, two rifled guns, eight hundred small arms, Morgan's battle-flag, and two regimental flags, which the enemy had previously captured from the national troops, and killed and wounded over two hun dred men, exclusive of prisoners. Morgan's division was thoroughly broken, and Armstrong's was thrown into rapid re-"], [31, "OPERATIONS FROM JANNARY TO MARCH, 1864. 17 treat. Guerrillas were also active. January 20th, one hun dred and fifty guerrillas attacked Tracy City, and having three times summoned the garrison to surrender, were handsomely repulsed. The next day, Colonel T. J. Harrison, Thirty-ninth Indiana Mounted Infantry, sent two hundred men on an expedition to Sparta, Tennessee, to look after the guerrillas infesting that region. This party in five subdivisions scoured the country occupied by the bands of Curtis, Ferguson, Bledsoe, and Mur ray. Remaining out several days, they killed four men, wounded five or six, and captured fifteen, including a captain and lieutenant. They also captured thirty horses and twenty stand of arms. On the 24th, Colonel Boone, commanding the Twenty eighth Kentucky Mounted Infantry , with four hundred and forty-six men, moved through McLemore's Cove, crossed to Broomtown valley, aud proceeded through Summerville, across Taylor's ridge, to Dirt Town. Beyond the latter place he de stroyed a camp of the Georgia militia, captured fifteen men, including Captain Hubbard, and returned without loss. Upon the completion of the railroad from Bridgeport to Chattanooga, General Thomas transferred the working parties to the road leading to Knoxville, and on the 24th directed General Stanley, commanding the First division of the Fourth Corps, to dispose his command from Chickamauga Station to the Hiawassee river, to protect the workmen on the road. As it had been suggested that troops might be sent to East Tennessee to support Foster against Longstreet, these troops were thus in readiness to meet this contingency while guarding the railroad, and watching against the direct move ment of troops from Dalton to Longstreet. As deserters concurred in asserting that General Johnston was sending troops south from Dalton, General Thomas di rected General Palmer to make a reconnoissance with a por tion of his command to ascertain, if possible, whether these representations were true. The latter having accomplished his office by developing a strong force at Tunnel Hill, returned to Chattanooga. VOL. II \u2014 2"], [32, "OPERATIONS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH, 1864. 18 February 10th, General Grant directed General Thomas to prepare for an advance to Knoxville, with such forces as could be spared from the protection of Chattanooga and its commu nications, to assist General Foster to drive Longstreet from East Tennessee. Such a movement was no part of the orig inal plan, but concurrent reports had convinced General Grant that there had been a heavy concentration of troops under Longstreet to secure East Tennessee, and he determined to prevent it, and relieve that flank from pressure. General Foster had prepared to assume the offensive if he could get at least ten thousand men from General Thomas. It was deemed safe to diminish the forces at Chattanooga, as there was reason to believe that Johnston had detached heavily from Dalton to reinforce Polk against Sherman in Alabama, as well as to strengthen Longstreet for offense against Foster in East Ten nessee. The Army of the Cumberland was not in condition to enter upon a winter campaign, and General Thomas found it diffi cult to make such preparations as he deemed essential. His army was greatly diminished by the absence of regiments having re-enlisted as veterans. Artillery horses and train animals had not been supplied in room of the thousands that had died frpm starvation during the siege, and he advised a postponement of the movement until the railroad would be in running order to Loudon. On the 12th, however, the day previous to the one designated for starting, he was informed by General Grant that a conversation with General Foster, who, on account of ill-health, had been superseded by General Schofield, and dispatches from the latter, induced him to doubt the propriety of moving against Longstreet, and suggested that should he not be required to go into East Tennessee, he should make a formidable reconnoissance toward Dalton, and if possible occupy that place, and repair the railroads to it. This order was given on the 17th, and at the time there was some probability that it might be successful, as it was sup posed that Johnston had weakened his center, especially to strengthen Polk against Sherman. Two days later, however, General Thomas received information that Johnston had in hand six divisions, comprising from thirty to forty thousand"], [33, "OPERATIONS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH, 1864. 19 men, and that no troops had been sent away, except one bri gade of infantry. This intelligence did not, however, induce General Grant to recall the movement, though it rendered General Thomas hopeless of success. The troops were put in motion toward Dalton, February 22d. General Thomas threw General Stanley's division, Gen eral Crust commanding, with such cavalry as he could safely withdraw from Calhoun, Tennessee, forward on the Spring Place road, and Johnston's and Baird's divisions, with cavalry in advance and on the right flank, directly to Ringgold. At night, Crust's division was at Red Clay, with Long's cavalry in advance, having been instructed to observe the enemy well toward Dalton, and give timely warning of any effort to turn Crust's left flank, or to notify him to advance should Johnston retire. The other divisions were at Ringgold, in position on the ridge west of East Chickamauga, with a regiment of mounted infantry on each flank, and Carlin's brigade thrown toward Taylor's ridge. During the evening, General Palmer advised General Thomas that he had received intelligence that Johnston had dispatched Cheatham's and Cleburne's divisions to reinforce General Polk, who was falling back before General Sherman, in Alabama. All available troops were now moved up to dis lodge General Johnston, should this report prove to be true. Davis' division advanced to Ringgold on the 23d, and General Matthias was directed to send six regiments from Cleveland to support General Crust, at Red Clay. Colonel Long advanced toward Dalton, on the Spring Place road ; first drove in the enemy's videttes, and when within four miles of Dalton, at tacked and routed from camp a regiment of infantry. The enemy then forming in force, he withdrew to Russell's Mills. Crust's division advanced to Lee's house, on the road from Red Clay to Tunnel Hill. The four divisions were now well concentrated in the vicinity of Ringgold, and after a thorough reconnoissance on each flank, General Palmer advanced, on the 24th, to develop the enemy's strength at Tunnel Hill. After skirmishing three or four miles with Wheeler's cavalry, he gained possession of the town, when the enemy formed a new line, and opened with his batteries from a hill, one mile"], [34, "20 OPERATIONS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH, 1864. beyond. General Palmer then withdrew, and encamped three miles to the northwest. The following morning he decided to feel the enemy's position more fully. Baird's division was south of Taylor's Ridge near Ringgold, and Crust's was well closed up on its left. Davis'* and Johnson's divisions were in the advance toward Tunnel Hill, with Harrison's mounted infantry in front, and Boone's on the left flank, and Long's brigade, supported by Grose's brigade of Crust's division, was at Varnell's station, on the Dalton and Cleveland railroad. These pairs of divisions were ordered to advance on different lines, the former upon Tunnel Hill, and, if practicable, directly upon Dalton ; the latter, with Long's cavalry, to move down the valley, along the eastern base of Rocky Face Ridge, to threaten the right and rear of the enemy. In compliance, the troops on the right advanced in three columns. After the right and left had moved some distance, the center advanced, but was soon checked by a battery of Parrott guns planted on the summit beyond the town of Tunnel Hill, and skillfully handled. The right and left col umns, Morgan's and Hambright's brigades, again advanced, and flanking this battery, forced its retirement. Davis' di vision, with Johnson's in support, pursued and found the enemy at Buzzard's Roost, a gap in Rocky Face Ridge, whose precipitous acclivities and salient summits forbade assault. Baird and Crust also encountered the enemy as they moved down Rocky Face valley. Giving ground at first, he soon offered resistance upon a central hill. An attack was here nec essary to develop his strength ; and General Turchin, with four regiments, the Eleventh, Eighty-ninth, and Ninety-second Ohio, aud the Eighty-second Indiana, was directed to advance. Advancing boldly, these troops pressed back the enemy and reached the summit, but were unable to hold it, as the routed troops met reinforcements, and returned in overwhelming force. The conflict was sharp, but it was too unequal to be maintained, and Turchin yielded the hill. Spirited skir mishing and cannonading were continued until nightfall, when the national troops were withdrawn. Colonel Harrison spent * General Davis' division had previously closed up from the rear."], [35, "OPERATIONS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH, 1864. 21 the night at a gap six miles south of Buzzard's Roost, nearly opposite Dalton, whence he was driven the following morning by Cleburne's division, one of the two that had been dis patched to Alabama. As it had been ascertained that General Johnston was holding his strong positions with forces superior to his own, General Thomas deemed it futile to attempt to dislodge him, and that it was even impracticable to maintain his threatening attitude. The country was stripped of provisions, and his transportation was not sufficient to supply his command. He therefore advised General Grant of his embarrassment, and suggested the abandonment of the enterprise. In reply, Gen eral Grant urged him to maintain his position, and make the impression upon Johnston that an advance into the heart ot the South was intended, until the fate of General Sherman should be known. Compliance, however, was not considered practicable, and as it was known that Johnston had recalled his divisions from Polk's support, orders were issued for the withdrawal of the troops. Baird's division was posted on a line of hills north of the town of Tunnel Hill, to cover the re tirement of Johnson and Davis, and then took permanent post at Ringgold. Davis' division returned to his former position near Rossville. Two brigades of Johnson's division were posted at Tyner's Station, and the third atGraysville, with a strong guard at Parker's Gap, to protect Baird's left flank. Crust's division returned to Ooltawah and Blue Springs, the commander sending a detachment to Cleveland to guard his supplies, where Colonel Long also took post to patrol the left flank of the army. Colonels Harrison and Boone were stationed at Leet's tanyard, to observe the enemy toward Lafayette. This movement to Dalton involved a loss of more than three hundred men killed and wounded. Among the wounded was Colonel Mihalotzy, of the Twenty-fourth Illinois, who died a few days later at Chattanooga. The enemy's loss was probably two hundred. As a reconnoissance it was successful, though there were no such results as General Grant mentioned as probable. It seemingly recalled the two divisions that General Johnston had sent against General Sherman, but as"], [36, "OPERATIONS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH, 1864. 22 the latter had retreated from Meridian on the 20th, six days previous to their return, the demonstration had no effect upon their movements. The chief advantages were the develop ment of the strength of General Johnston's position before Dalton, and the suggestion to General Thomas of a plan to turn it by a movement through Snake Creek Gap. He was so impressed with the feasibility of this plan, that upon his return to Chattanooga, he requested permission from General Grant to make preparation to accomplish it. Having disposed his troops for defense, General Thomas ad dressed himself to preparation for the spring campaign. He ordered General Butterfield to make a careful examination of the Nashville and Chattanooga railroad, and Captain Merrill, chief engineer of the depai'tment, to examine other roads, to ascertain the minimum force necessary to hold them securely. He also ordered a thorough examination of the railroad to Tunnel Hill, with a view to its repair, as an important step in provision for an advance. These examinations resulted in a more economical pro tection of railroad communications, by means of a system of block-houses at the bridges and other important points, which became an element of power to the close of the war. And the conclusion having been reached that six thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry could hold securely the railroads to Nashville, General Thomas recommended that the railroad guards, as far as practicable, should be drawn from the local Tennessee militia. The month of February closed with the military situation by no means developed. General Sherman destroyed rail roads extensively in Mississippi, but otherwise his expedition was not compensative. It was not known what Longstreet would do, whether give further trouble in East Tennessee, re turn to Virginia, or join Johnston. Neither were General Johnston's plans at all indicated. One day would bring ru mors from deserters, and from sources more reliable, that he was under orders to withdraw his army from Dalton, followed on the next by contradictions from sources equally entitled to credence. But ignorance of the purposes of the enemy did not prevent' preparation for aggression. Reconstruction of"], [37, "OPERATIONS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH, 1864. 23 railroads was pressed westward and southward, and material and supplies were accumulated as rapidly as possible. Steam boats aud large storehouses were built. Horses were provided for the artillery, and efforts were made to recuperate those of the cavalry worn down by hard winter service. Eight com panies of the First Michigan Engineers and Mechanics, and two regiments of colored troops, were ordered to commence the construction of block-houses and other defenses along the line of the Nashville and Chattanooga railroad, and the first Missouri Engineers and Mechanics were detailed for similar duty on the Nashville and Decatur railroad. In anticipation of a campaign designed to bisect the Gulf States east of the Mississippi river, the secure defense of railroad communi cations from Chattanooga to the North with the least pos sible draft upon the strength of the aggressive columns, was a matter of great moment. With strong block-houses at all the bridges, and with earthworks, in addition, at all of the more important points, a comparatively small force could hold the roads securely \u2014 at least, could prevent all damage that could not be quickly repaired. One of the greatest embarrass ments to Generals Buell and Rosecrans, had been the neces sity of scattering their troops in heavy detachments on their lines of supply. The plan now adopted promised better se curity, both to the railroads and to the troops guarding them; while employing a small portion of the force formerly assigned to this service. Besides, it transferred the cavalry almost en tirely from the rear to the front, and relieved the veteran infantry from guard duty, as new regiments and local militia could be trusted to hold the block-houses and earthworks. At the beginning of March there were indications that General Johnston was receiving reinforcements at Dalton, and General Grant was not free from apprehension that Longstreet's army might join him, in addition to other forces, for an attack upon Chattanooga. To provide against such a . contingency, the two divisions of the Fourth Corps in East Tennessee were ordered to be constantly ready for quick movement to support General Thomas. On the 3d, Wagner's brigade of Sheridan's division was moved to Calhoun, Tennessee, to relieve the first brigade of the first division of cavalry, Colonel Campbell"], [38, "24 OPERATIONS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH, 1864. commanding, that it might take post at Cleveland. Five days later, Colonel Daniel McCook, commanding second brigade of Davis' division, was ordered to Lee and Gordon's Mills, to give strength to the front, and observe the enemy upon a line of former approach. The same day, Colonel Harrison was driven from Leet's tanyard by a strong force of cavalry. This advance, coupled with rumors that Johnston had been joined by ten thousand men from South Carolina and by Roddy's cavalry, th*at Longstreet's cavalry was in motion toward him, and that his troops were under orders to carry three clays' rations on their persons, intensified somewhat the apprehen sion that an offensive movement was meditated. There were no changes of troops, however, except that McCook's division of cavalry was ordered to Cleveland, since it was not yet deemed safe to withdraw the Fourth Corps from East Ten nessee, as Longstreet's action was still uncertain. On the 17th of March, General Grant, having been appointed lieutenant-general, in command of the entire army, advised General Thomas that Major-General W. T. Sherman had been assigned to the command of the Military Division of the Mis sissippi. The assumption of general command by General Grant gave the contemplated campaign into Georgia a closer relation to operations against General Lee's army in Virginia than had previously existed between movements east and west. Soon after his assignment to the command of the military division, General Sherman went to Chattanooga to confer with General Thomas with regard to future movements. At this conference, General Thomas suggested that the armies of the Tennessee and Ohio, under the respective commands of Major- Generals McPherson and Schofield, should demonstrate against Johnston's position before Dalton, by the direct roads to Buz zard's Roost, and from Cleveland, while he should throw the entire Army of the Cumberland through Snake Creek Gap, which he knew to be unguarded, and fall upon Johnston's communications between Dalton and Resaca, and thereby turn his position completely, and either force him to retreat to ward the east, through a difficult country poorly supplied with provisions and forage, with a strong probability of the total"], [39, "OPERATIONS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH, 1864. 25 disorganization of his army, or attack him, in which event he felt confident of being able to beat him, especially as he hoped to gain position in his rear before he should be aware of his movement. General Sherman objected to this suggestion, for the reason that he desired the Army of the Cumberland to form the reserve of the united armies, and to serve as a rally ing point from which the two wings, the armies of the Ten nessee and Ohio, could operate. The union of the armies of the Cumberland, Tennessee, and Ohio in a campaign from Chattanooga as a base, having been determined upon, preparations of the grandest dimen sions possible were at once inaugurated with vigor. The most difficult problem was that of supplies. Its solution turned upon the capacity of a single railroad track from Stevenson to Chattanooga, and thence toward Atlanta. There was steam boat transportation from Bridgeport to Chattanooga; but there was dependence alone upon the track from the former place to Stevenson. As the accumulation of supplies at Chat tanooga had hitherto been slight, General Sherman restricted railroad transportation to dead freight, and forbade passage to citizens or private property. He also forbade the further issue of rations to the destitute citizens of the country. The peo ple complained of these measures ; but such was the necessity for the accumulation of supplies, that he persisted in their maintenance, against the protests of the citizens, remon strances from Washington, and what under other circum stances would have been the demands of humanity. During the month of April, again, as before the battles in November, Chattanooga was the scene of the greatest activity. Troops were constantly coming up from the rear aud moving to position in the front. The quartermaster and commissary departments were pressed to extreme exertion building steam boats, erecting and filling vast storehouses, bringing forward artillery and cavalry horses, mules, and cattle ; while the rail way was almost constantly trembling under the long trains heavily loaded with supplies and munitions. General Johnston, in the meantime, was not idle, though he was restrained in his preparation for an offensive movement, which it was expected in the South he would be able to make"], [40, "26 OPERATIONS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH, 1864. in such force as to change the theater of war again to the North. He waited for preparation for well-sustained aggres sion, and thus lost an opportunity for partial success. Cleve land was the weak point in he national line. General Thomas could not hold this vital point strongly while the Fourth Corps remained with General Schofield, and this corps could not be safely withdrawn until it was known that Longstreet had abandoned East Tennessee. But before Johnston was well prepared even for defense, the opportunity was lost for forcing any concentration of troops which was not required by Gen eral Sherman's plan of operations. General Johnston was fully alive to the importance of successful aggression to change the tone of feeling in the South, and sought such reinforce ments as he thought were necessary. A little later he learned that he needed more troops than were available in all the South, upon the plan of defense which was adopted. In the light of subsequent events, it is plain that in failing to give adequate reinforcements to Johnston, while General Grant's armies were widely separated and weakened by the temporary absence of veteran regiments, the Confederate authorities at Richmond rendered impossible the aggression for which they subsequently clamored. In December previous, General Beau regard suggested, as the only hope of success, that Richmond and other important places should be fortified and garrisoned for defense, and that an immense army should be concentrated against Grant, at Chattanooga, or thrown in bold offense from Knoxville. Later, General Johnston's suggestions were some what similar, but were unheeded by Mr. Davis and his advis ers. The Western army remained in diffusion, until concen tration, as a necessity of defense rather than a condition of aggression, was hurriedly effected. Longstreet's army was sent to General Lee, and from all of the troops that so long menaced Knoxville, only Martin's division of cavalry joined General Johnston ; while almost all the national troops that wintered in East Tennessee were free to join the combination against him. The impracticable President had entertained visions of successful aggression from Dalton, but had been, from choice or necessity, so sparing in provision for such enter prise, that the thought of it, except in wildest vagary, could"], [41, "OPERATIONS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH, 1864. 27 not be entertained. To require Johnston to advance with less than fifty thousand men against a combination of armies, which in defense would greatly exceed one hundred thousand, was to exact defeat. The fact that the Confederate President did not discern this, revealed his incapacity as a revolutionary leader, and his subsequent criticisms of his ablest general, for the non-accomplishment of a palpable impossibility, manifested the inveteracy of his self-conceit and his utter misapprehen sion of the situation in Georgia. His general had no choice of methods, but was confined to the defense of his positions between his enemy and the campaign region south of Resaca. Had he been able to assume the offensive, he could not have reached any vital point in the rear of Chattanooga, without a long detour, in dependence for supplies upon a devastated country, or on wagon transportation from a remote base. In his weakness and his restriction from movement by mountain barriers right and left, he could make no flank movements or threatening dashes, with infantry or cavalry ; and any expec tation of a general advance from Dalton, except with an im mense army, through East Tennessee or Northern Alabama, Bridgeport or Decatur \u2014 was groundless. Having now, from necessity, accepted the defensive, General Johnston could only make effort to embarrass Sherman's com munications with his cavalry, and await the approach of the armies combining against him. He threw his cavalry into Northern Alabama, in constant menace, but accomplished no interruption to communications. General Thomas sent Gen eral Geary, with two regiments and one piece of artillery, on a steamboat, to destroy the boats used by the cavalry in cross ing and recrossing the river, as far to the west as possible. General Geary was only partially successful ; he destroyed a great many boats in going and coming, but was prevented by forces on each side of the river from going a great distance. On the 29th of April, a tentative advance was made by Gen eral Baird, having reference to the general movement of the united armies. He sent three hundred cavalry, under General Kilpatrick, supported by Vanderveer's brigade, to feel the ene my's position at Tunnel Hill. These troops encountered the enemy and drove him some distance, when developing a greatly"], [42, "OPERATIONS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH, 1864. 28 superior force, they were compelled to withdraw. At Davis' house the enemy pressed thorn, when they turned and repulsed him handsomely. The day following, General Johnston gave indications of greater strength in front of Ringgold, and Gen eral Thomas instructed General .Baird to call upon General Johnson for help in the event of an advance against his posi tion. During the month, important changes were made in the Army of the Cumberland. The reorganization of the Fourth and Fourteenth Corps having been of recent date, they remained intact, except some changes in general officers. On the 11th, the cavalry, under the general command of Brigadier-General W. L. Elliott, was organized into four divisions; Colonel Ed ward McCook, and Brigadier-Generals Kennard Garrard, Jud son Kilpatrick, and A. C. Gillem, commanding respectively, ac cording to numerical designation. There were three brigades in each division, and an average of three regiments in each brigade. On the 15th, orders were received from Washington, requiring the consolidation of the Eleventh and Twelfth Corps as the Twentieth, under the command of Major-General Hooker. Major-General Gordon Granger was relieved from the command of the Fourth Corps, and Major-General 0. 0. Howard assigned, and Major-General P. H. Sheridan having been transferred to the Army of the Potomac, Major-General John Newton was assigned to the position made vacant by his vacation of the command of the Second division, Fourth Corps. There were now in the Army of the Cumberland a large num ber of re-enlisted troops. During the winter and spring there re-enlisted eighty-eight regiments of infantry, three of mounted infantry, sixteen of cavalry, eighteen batteries of artillery, and twenty-six detachments of all arms, and eight thousand one hundred and thirty-six recruits in the aggregate were added to these organizations while on furlough. The importance of the re-enlistment of these troops can not be overestimated. With out them and the \" veterans \" of the other . two co-operative armies, the Atlanta campaign could not have been safely un dertaken ; the war would have been greatly postponed, and its issue might have been different. The slow movement of the draft, and the provisional measure of short enlistments could"], [43, "OPERATIONS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH, 1864. 29 not have furnished such troops as were demanded in the spring of 1864. Without the veterans, aggression could not have been entertained, and the feeble armies, during the summer, might have been compelled to relax their grasp upon the heart of the rebellious states. It is then the plainest duty of the his torian to mention the regiments and other organizations, whose members, in whole or in part, re-enlisted as \" veteran volun teers,\" and ever after bore the grandest name which the war originated. Of the regiments and batteries whose organization was maintained under re-enlistment, were the Thirteenth, Fif teenth, Seventeenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-first, Twenty-sixth, Thirty-first, Thirty-third, Thirty-sixth, Fortieth, Forty-first, Forty-ninth, Fifth-first, Fifty-fifth, Sixty-first, Sixty-fifth, Sixty-ninth, Seventy -first, Seventy-fourth, and Eighty-second Ohio Infantry ; the First, Third, and Fourth Ohio Cavalry, and batteries \" B,\" \" C,\" \" F,\" and \" G,\" First Ohio Artillery ; the Twenty-second, Thirtieth, Thirty -first, Thirty -fifth, Fortieth, Forty-second, Forty-fourth, Fifty-first, Fifty-seventh and Fifty-eighth Indiana Infantry ; Seventy-ninth Mounted Infan try, and Thirteenth Indiana battery; the Tenth, Twenty -first, Thirty-sixth, Thirty-eighth, Forty-second, Forty-fourth, Fifty first, Fifty-ninth, and Sixtieth Ulinois Infantry, and batteries *' H \"and \" I,\" Second Illinois Artillery ; the Fourth, Eighteenth, Twenty -first, and Twenty-third Kentucky Infantry ; the Sec ond, Third, Fourth, and Sixth Kentucky Cavalry, and the Twenty-eighth Kentucky Mounted Infantry ; the Forty-sixth, Seventy-third, Seventy-ninth, and One Hundred and Ninth Pennsylvania Infantry, and the Seventh Pennsylvania Cavalry ; the Forty -fifth, Fifty-eighth, and Sixtieth New York Infantry, and the New York Independent Battery; the Tenth and Thir teenth Michigan Infanty ; the Fourteenth Michigan Mounted Infantry, aud the First Michigan battery ; the Thirteenth Wis consin Infantry, and the Fifth Wisconsin battery; the Fif teenth Missouri Infantry, and battery \"G,\" First Missouri Artillery; the Second Minnesota Infantry; the Fifth Iowa Cavalry ; the Eighth Kansas Infantry, and Third Maryland In fantry.

On the 1st of May, the Army of the Cumberland was well in hand, awaiting orders to advance. The Fourth Corps, Major-General 0. O. Howard commanding, was at Cleveland. The Fourteenth, Major-General J. M. Palmer commanding, was before Chattanooga, and the Twentieth Corps, Major- General Joseph Hooker commandiug, was mainly in Lookout valley. The divisions of the Fourth Corps, in numerical order, were commanded by Major-Generals D. S. Stanley and John Newton and Brigadier-General T. J. Wood ; those of the Fourteenth, Brigadier-Generals R. W. Johnson, J. C. Davis, and A. Baird, and those of the Twentieth, Brigadier-General A. S. Williams and J. W. Geary and Major-Generals D. But terfield and Lovell H. Rousseau. The division of the latter, and other troops of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, assigned as garrisons, comprising thirty -two regiments of infantry, nine of cavalry, and thirty-nine batteries, were disposed at all im portant points from Chattanooga to Nashville, on the direct road, and at Clarksville and Fort Donelson. The cavalry comprised four divisions, under Brigadier-General W. L. Elli ott \u2014 the first, Colonel McCook commanding, was with the Fourth Corps, at Cleveland ; the second under Brigadier-Gen eral Garrard, was ordered to report to Geueral McPherson commanding the Army of the Tennessee ; the third under Brig adier-General Kilpatrick, was at Ringgold, and the Fourth, under Brigadier-General Gillem, was at Nashville. The army for the field comprised 54,568 infantry, 3,238 cavalry, and 2,377 artillery, with 130 guns; total, 60,773 effective men."], [45, "OPERATIONS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH, 1864. 31 Organization of the Army of the Cumberland, Major-General George H.

To do do this with effect, in the face of Longstreet's reinforcements, will require at least ten thousand infantry from you. In addition, that you place working gangs on the road to the Hiawassee bridge, so as to increase our supplies, which may be boated over the Tennessee, at Loudon, and afterward sent by rail to this place. I also require a pontoon train of twelve hundred feet length. Colonel Babcock will come down in the first boat, to attend to this.

Please telepraph what is the extent of the assistance you can give me J. G. FOSTER, Major-General Commanding. Nashville, Tenn., February 6, 1864 \u2014 2.30 p. m. Major-General Thomas : Reports of scouts make it evident that Joe Johnston has removed most of his force from your front, two divisions going to Longstreet. Longstreet has been reinforced by troops from the East. This makes it evident that they intend to secure East Tennessee, if they can, and I intend to drive them out, or get whipped this month. For this purpose, you will have to detach at least ten thousand men, besides Stanley's division (more will be better). I can partly relieve the vacuum at Chat tanooga by troops from Logan's command. It will not be necessary to"], [54, "OPERATIONS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH, 1864. 40 take artillery or wagons to Knoxville, but all the serviceable artillery horses should be taken to use on artillery there. Six mules to each one hundred men should also be ta\u00bb if you have them to spare. Let me know how soon you can start. MAJOR-GENERAL GRANT. Nashville, February 10, 1864. Major-General Thomas : Prepare to start for Knoxville on Saturday. I will order Logan to send to Chattanooga all the troops he can, and still hold his line of the road. The number will probably be about five thousand men. One division of your command will have to move out to hold the road to the Hiawassee. MAJOR-GENERAL GRANT. Nashville, February 17, 1864. Major-General Ttiomas: Longstreet can not afford to place his force between Knoxville and the Tennessee. If he does, it will then be time to move against him. The work of a raid on the road can soon be repaired, if it can not be pre vented. Make your contemplated move as soon as possible. MAJOR-GENERAL GRANT. Chattanooga, Tenn., February 19, 1864. Major-General Chant, Nashville, Tenn. : Assistant Surgeon Jacob Miller, Sixth Missouri Volunteer Infantry, arrived here yesterday, from Dalton. He was captured at Lebanon, Alabama, when General Logan sent out an expedition toward Rome. He reports Cleburne's division at Tunnel Hill, Stewart's division between Tunnel Hill and Dalton; Walker, two miles out from Dalton, toward Spring Place; Cheatham at Dalton; and Stevenson's and Bate's divisions to the west of Dalton two miles. He saw all of tho camps, and estimates their force between thirty and forty thousand. He moreover states that no troops have beon sent away, except one brigade of infantry, which went to Rome, about the 1 st of this month. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Tunnell Hill, February 26, 1864 \u2014 7 J p. m. Major-General U. S. Grant, Nashville : I arrived here last night. Davis and Johnson occupy the pass at Buzzard's Roost. They have a force equal to theirs in their front, who outnumber them in artillery. It is not possible to carry this place by assault. General Palmer made tho attempt to turn yesterday, with Baird's and Crust's divisions, but was met by an equal force, exclusive of their cavalry, and in an equally strong position as at Buzzard's Roost. After expending nearly all of his ammunition, he retired during the night, to Catoosa Platform. Our transportation is poor and limited ; we"], [55, "OPERATIONS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH, 1864. 41 are not able to carry more than sixty rounds per man. Artillery horses so poor, that Palmer could bring but sixteen pieces. The country is stripped entirely of subsistence and forage. The enemy's cavalry is much superior to ours. Prisoners taken yesterday report that a portion of Cleburne's division has returned. I will wait the development of this day, and advise you further. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Nashville, February 27, 1864. Major-General Geo. H. Tliomas : It is of the utmost importance that the enemy should be held in full belief that an advance into the heart of the South is intended, until the fate of General Sherman is fully known. The difficulties of supplies can be overcome by keeping your trains running between Chattanooga and your position. Take the depot trains at Chattanooga, yours and General Howard's wagons; these can be replaced temporarily, by yours returning. Veterans are returning daily. This will enable you to draw reinforcements constantly to your front. Can General Schofield not also take a division from Howard's corps? It is intended to send Granger to you the moment Schofield is thought to be safe without him. U. S. GRANT, Major-General. Nashville, February 27 \u2014 6 p. m. Brigadier-General Whipple, Chief of Staff: Information has reached Washington, that orders have been given for Johnston's army to fall back. General Thomas should watch any such movement and follow it up closely. Can't you draw teams from Bridge port and Stevenson, to send supplies to the front? They have teams in great numbers at those places. Every energy should be exerted to get supplies and reinforcements forward. Troops will leave here at the rate of two or three thousand a day, for the front. Many of them go to Chattanooga. U. S. GRANT, Major-General. Chattanooga, March 5, 1864 \u2014 11 p. m. Major-General Schofield, Knoxville : I have just received reliable information that Johnston has been rein forced by ten thousand men from South Carolina, and by Roddy, and that he contemplates making an offensive movement in this direction. Can you spare Granger's corps? If so, please direct them to concentrate at Cleveland, leaving a brigade of infantry and battery at Calhoun, to guard the railroad at that place. GEORGE H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V."], [56, "OPERATIONS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH, 1864. 42 Chattanooga, March 5, 1864. Major-General John M. Schofield, Knoxville : It has been reported to Major-General Thomas to-day, and also two days since, that the enemy were heavily reinforcing at Dalton. General Grant thinks it is not improbable that he may advance against us here. In that case we shall need the Fourth Corps, and wish you to hold it in readiness to send, if it be needed. Can not send you any assistance while this contingency is hanging over us. WILLIAM D. WHIPPLE, Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff. EXTRACTS FROM THE OFFICIAL REPORT OF GENERAL JOS. E. JOHNSTON. On the 17th of February, the President ordered me, by telegraph, to detach Lieutenant-General Hardee with the infantry of his corps, except Stevenson's division, to aid Lieutenant-General Polk, against Sherman in Mississippi. This order was obeyed as promptly as our means of trans portation permitted. On the 27th of February, I suggested to the executive by letter, through General Bragg, that all preparations for a forward movement should be made without delay. In a letter, dated 4th of March, General Bragg \u2022desired me \" to have all things ready at the earliest practicable moment, for the movement indicated.\" In replying, on the 12th, I reminded him that the regulations of the war department do not leave such prep arations to commanders of troops, but to officers who receive their orders from Richmond. On the 18th, a letter was received from General Bragg, sketching a plan of offensive operations, and enumerating the troops to be used in them under me. I was invited to express my views on the subject. In doing so, both by telegraph and mail, I suggested modifications, and urged that the additional troops named should be sent immediately, to enable us, should the enemy advance, to beat him, and then move for ward; or, should he not advance, do so ourselves. General Bragg replied, by telegraph, on the 21st: \"Your dispatch of 19th does not indicate acceptance of plan proposed. Troops can only be drawn from other points for advance. Upon your decision of that point, further action must depend. I replied, by telegraph, on the 22d: \"In my dispatch of the 19th, I expressly accept taking offensive, only differ with you as to details. I assume that the enemy will be prepared for an advance before we are, and will make it to our advantage. Therefore I propose, both for offensive and defensive, to assemble our troops here immediately.\" This was not noticed. Therefore, on the 25th, I again urged tho necessity of reinforcing the Army of the Tennessee, because the enemy was collecting a larger force than that of the last campaign, while ours was less than it had been then."], [57, "OPERATIONS FROM JANUARY TO MARCH, 1864. 43 On the 8th of April, Colonel B. S. Ewell, A. A. G., was sent to Richmond, to represent to the President my wish to take the offensive, with proper means, and to learn his views. A few days after, Brigadier-General Pen dleton arrived from Richmond, to explain to me the President's wishes on the subject. I explained to him the modification of the plan com municated by General Bragg, which seemed to me essential, which re quired that intended reinforcements should be sent to Dalton. I urged that this should be done without delay, because our present force was not sufficient even for defense, and to enable us to take the offensive, if the enemy did not. By Telegraph from Chattanooga, February 28, 1864. Major- General Grant, Nashville : General Butterfield, by my direction, has recently examined the line between here and Nashville, and reports that he thinks six thousand men will be sufficient to guard that line, two regiments of which force should be cavalry. From what I know of the road between Nashville and De catur, two thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry will be sufficient to protect that line. One thousand infantry will be sufficient to protect the line from Athens to Stevenson. Probably both lines of communication can be guarded by six thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry, a great portion of which should be made up from the local militia of Ten nessee, or troops organized especially for the preservation of order in the state. I believe if I can commence the campaign with the Fourteenth and Fourth Corps in front, with Howard's corps in reserve, that I can move along the line of the railroad and overcome all opposition as far at least as Atlanta. I should want a strong division of cavalry in advance. As soon as Captain Merrill returns from his reconnoissance along the railroad lines, I can give you a definite estimate of the number of troops required to guard the bridges along the road. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. EXTRACT FROM GENERAL THOMAS' REPORT TO THE COM- MITTEE ON THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR. The above proposition was submitted to General Grant for his approval, and if obtained it was my intention (having acquired by the reconnoissance of February 23d, 24th, and 25th, a thorough knowledge of the approaches direct upon Dalton from Ringgold and Cleveland) to have made a strong demonstration against Buzzard's Roost, attracting Johnston's whole atten tion to that point, and to have thrown the main body of my infantry and cavalry through Snake Creek Gap, upon his communications, which I had ascertained from scouts he had up to that time neglected to observe or guard. With this view, I had previously asked for the return to me of Granger's corps and my cavalry from East Tennessee, and had already initiated preparations for the execution of the above movement as soon as the spring opened sufficiently to admit of it."], [58, "44 CHAPTER XXVI. THE TURNING OF DALTON. The first of May, 1864, was a crisis of the war. Two of the largest armies hitherto assembled East or West were in read iness to move against the enemy at the bidding of the Lieu tenant-General. The local objectives of these armies were distinct, but the common general object was the immediate suppression of the rebellion. It was proposed to accomplish this grand aim, by crushing General Lee's army covering Richmond and General Johnston's standing before Dalton. These two armies embodied the life of the rebellion. Generals Grant and Sherman were to move on lines too re mote to admit direct co-operation, but they proposed to be mutually helpful by simultaneous aggression. General Grant was to forbid the transfer of troops from Virginia to Georgia, by vigor of attack, and General Sherman was to engage John ston in such a manner that he could not send supporting col umns from Georgia to Virginia. Volunteers were invited for one hundred days, to hold the important points in the rear of the two great armies, that all the available veteran troops East might be massed against General Lee, and all in the West concentrated at Chattanooga, that General Sherman, with three armies in one, should dash upon General Johnston at Dalton. Campaigns, East or West, had never been undertaken under conditions of similar promise, and the loyal people were hope ful of early and complete success. The conditions of the Georgia campaign were exceedingly favorable to General Sherman, as compared with the ruling features of all preceding campaigns in the central theater of war. The superiority of the national army at Chattanooga"], [59, "45 THE TURNING OF DALTON. had been far greater than in any previous battle in this region, and in some of the anterior engagements, as at Chickamauga, the enemy had been superior. But General Sherman's pre ponderance of strength was greater than General Grant's when Geueral Bragg was hurled from Lookout Mountain and Mis sionary Ridge. Then the strength of the opposing armies was perhaps as three to two ; it was now to be as two to one. Be sides, General Johnston could not now have, as his predecessor had always had, when on the defensive, the advantage of inte rior lines. The possession of Chattanooga and Cleveland, with roads converging at Dalton, gave direct lines for General Sherman's first advance, and with the railroad and river from Knoxville to Decatur well guarded, and a fortified line of sup ply from the north, he could move southward without endan gering flank or rear, so long as he could so engage the enemy as to keep him before him. In the projected campaign, neither General Sherman nor General Johnston could have the ad vantage of interior lines, only so far as the defensive could give to either, shorter lines for maneuver and array, within a linjited range only. The general line of maneuver being north and south, forbade great advantage of lines to either. But General Johnston had other advantages. He had choice of positions and could always resist behind battlements with good management, and in giving ground would be con stantly gathering to him his reserves ; while General Sherman, in advancing, would be compelled to detach more aud more from hi3 offensive forces to guard his constantly lengthening line of supply. So, therefore, the relative conditions of the campaign were by no means expressed by the comparative pro portions of the opposing armies. The 2d day of May was first named by General Grant for the advance of the great armies, but finally the 5th was announced in orders. General Thomas, however, commenced his dispositions and movements on the 2d. On this day, Gen eral Davis' division joined General Baird's at Ringgold, and General Butterfield's advanced from Lookout valley to Lee and Gordon's Mills. During the day, General Baird sent infantry and cavalry detachments to reconnoiter toward Tuu nel Hill, and developed the enemy in force at that point."], [60, "46 THE TURNING OF DALTON. May 3d, General Johnson's division closed upon the other two of the Fourteenth Corps at Ringgold. On the day following, the Fourth Corps, with McCook's division of cavalry on its left flank, advanced to Catoosa Springs, and Butterfield's division advanced to Pleasant Grove, and General Williams' division to Lee and Gordon's Mills. The next day, General Geary's division, having marched across the mountain from Bridgeport, closed up on the other divisions of the Twentieth Corps at Leet's tanyard, completing the concentration of the Army of the Cumberland. General Sherman originally designed that the Army of the Tennessee, Major-General McPherson commanding, should ad vance from Decatur by Gunter's Landing and Lebanon, Ala bama, to Lafayette, Georgia ; but subsequently, he ordered it to move upon Chattanooga. This army was not as strong as had been anticipated, as two of its veteran divisions under General A. J. Smith were detained by the protraction of General Banks' expedition west of the Mississippi river. With two corps, General McPherson attained position at Lee and Gordon's Mills on the 6th, and the same day the Army of the Ohio, Ma jor-General Schofield commanding, reached Red Clay. At the close of this day the armies representing the controlling strength of the contending powers in the West, lay confronting each other on the eve of one of the greatest campaigns of a war, made memorable in the annals of the world by the magnitude of armies, the frequency of great battles, and im mense compass of military operations. General Sherman's three armies for offense now numbered nearly one hundred thousand men. There were sixty thou sand seven hundred and seventy-three men in the Army of the Cumberland ; twenty -four thousand and sixty-five in the Army of the Tennessee ; and thirteen thousand five hundred and fifty-nine in the Army of the Ohio. The Army of the Cumberland comprised fifty-four thousand five hundred and sixty-eight infantry, two thousand three hundred and seventy seven artillery, three thousand two hundred and twenty-eio-ht cavalry, and one hundred and thirty guns ; the Army of the Tennessee, twenty-two thousand infantry, one thousand four hundred and four artillery, six hundred and twenty-four cav-"], [61, "THE TURNING OF DALTON. 47 airy, and ninety-six guns ; and the Army of the Ohio, eleven thousand one hundred and eighty-three infantry, six hundred and seventy-nine artillery, one thousand six hundred and ninety-seven cavalry, and eighty-two guns. The grand aggre gates were eig1\" +y-eight thousand one hundred and eighty eight infantry, four thousand four hundred and sixty artillery, five thousand five hundred and forty-nine cavalry, and two hundred and fifty-four guns. General Johnston's army em braced forty-four thousand nine hundred infantry, artillery, and cavalry ; two corps, commanded by Lieutenant-Generals Hardee and Hood, and four thousand cavalry, by Major-Gen eral Wheeler. General Sherman proposed first to carry Tunnel Hill, and then threaten a direct attack upon Johnston's main position before Dalton, while McPherson's army should move through Snake Creek Gap to operate against Resaca. He accordingly gave orders, May 6th, requiring General Thomas, on the day following, to move his center, the Fourteenth Corps, directly upon Tunnel Hill ; his right, the Twentieth Corps, to Trickum, and his left, the Fourth Corps, to Lee's house, in support of the Fourteenth : General McPherson to advance with his army first upon Ship's Gap and Villanow, and thence to Suake Creek Gap, and through it as soon as practicable ; and General Scho field to move forward to Catoosa Springs, feeling toward Gen eral Thomas' left flank. The Army of the Cumberland moved on the 7th, iu com pliance with orders. The enemy made a show of resistance to Genera] Palmer, with infantry and artillery, at Tunnel Hill, but on the appearance of General Howard's corps upon his left, his troops fled to Buzzard's Roost. General Hooker, upon reaching Trickum, threw out detachments toward Buzzard's Roost on the left, and Villanow on the right, to observe the enemy. General Kilpatrick's cavalry remained at Gordon's Springs, in readiness to establish communications with the Army of the Tennessee, expected at Villanow on the morning of the 8th. The next day, Harker's brigade of Newton's division of the Fourth Corps advanced along Rocky Face ridge to a point within a mile and a half of the enemy's signal station."], [62, "48 THE TURNING OF DALTON. Meeting here with obstructions forbidding farther advance, Harker made preparations to hold the position. Skirmish lines were then thrown forward from Wood's, Davis', and Butterfield's divisions, and the enemy was pressed into his in trenchments at Buzzard's Roost, or \" Mill Creek Gap,\"* and the three divisions advanced to the entrance. As Geueral McPherson was now moving upon Snake Creek Gap, it was imperative that a strong feint should be made, to create the impression that it was the intention to carry the position by assault. Accordingly, General Geary was directed to scale Chattooga Mountain with his division, if practi cable, at the point known as Dug Gap, where the road from Lafayette to Dalton ascends from Mill Creek valley. Chat tooga Mountain is separated from Rocky Face ridge by Mill Creek at Buzzard's Roost, and from that point trends south ward. At the point selected for Geary's ascent, the mountain side is steep and rough, and the summit is crowned with a palisade of rocks, with occasional openings that admit passage to the top. With the One Hundred and Nineteenth New York de ployed as skirmishers, and Buschbeck's and Candy's brigades formed on right and left, in two lines of battle, Geary moved up the mountain. Midway, his skirmishers became hotly en gaged, but the enemy was pressed upward until the main lines reached the base of the palisades. After resting for a few minutes, to recover from the exhaustion produced by excessive heat and protracted exertion, an effort was made to reach the summit. A few men only succeeded, and they were either killed or forced back. The position was such that defense was easy, even by rolling stones from the summit. A second attempt, however, was made, soon after the first failed, but with similar issue. General Geary then brought McGill's rifled battery to bear upon the enemy in his front, to cover an effort of the Thirty -third New Jersey to reach the summit a half mile to the right, where the enemy made less show of strength. As in the other cases, a few men gained the crest, and their shouts invited the advance of the whole line, but * So designated by General Johnston."], [63, "THE TURNING OF DALTON. 49 again there was emphatic failure. By this time, General Hardee was present with reinforcements, and further effort would have been madness. Geary lost heavily, but his action being regarded by the enemy as the initiative to carry the po sition by assault, it was in some degree compensative, as such impression was the object of the movement. Night and the third repulse coming together, the division was withdrawn to the valley, out of reach of the enemy's guns. During the afternoon, Johnson's and Baird's divisions were advanced to Davis' support, and Butterfield's was ordered to join General Hooker. General Kilpatrick communicated with General McPherson, and then moved to Trickum. McCook's division was thrown on Schofield's left flank, to cover the ex tremity of the general line, until General Stoneman should come up. The position for General Garrard's cavalry division was to be with General McPherson, but it was yet in the rear, en route from Pulaski, Tennessee. The next day, the Army of the Cumberland was somewhat heavily engaged ou the east, north, and west of Buzzard's Roost. The action was intended as a feint, unless it should be ascertained that General Johnston was withdrawing his army. Such, however, was the position, by nature and art, that emphatic feiuts subjected the national forces to great ex posure, and there was considerable loss throughout the line. The character of the feints may be inferred from the fact that General Johnston reported that five assaults upon \" Rocky Face Mountain \" were repulsed on the 9th of May. His troops holding Buzzard Roost were Stewart's and Bate's di visions, supported by Stevenson's and Anderson's. The defenses for infantry were at right angles to the roads, and batteries, covered with abatis, were placed on the adjacent summits to throw a converging fire upon the valley, which was flooded by means of well-concealed dams. Carlin's bri gade, supported by the remainder of Johnson's division, felt the enemy's lines on the west; Morgan's brigade of Davis' division, on the north, and Grose's brigade of Stanley's divis ion, on the east. The loss in killed was slight, but a great many were wounded. The heaviest loss, in comparison with vol. n \u2014 4"], [64, "50 THE TURNING OF DALTON. the number of troops engaged, was in McCook's division on the extreme left. Under instructions from General Schofield, Colonel McCook made demonstrations on all the roads lead ing to Dalton on the east. Colonel La Grange, commanding his second brigade, encountered Wheeler, with twenty-two hundred men, on the road from Varnell's Station. He was at first successful, and pressed Wheeler back to intrenchments near Poplar Place, but was there repulsed with heavy loss. He and fourteen officers were captured, and one hundred and thirty-six of his men were either killed, wounded, or captured. Wheeler's loss was supposed to be greater. During the day, Hooker's corps was at Trickum to support McPherson in pass ing through Snake Creek Gap. The action the next day was less severe, though the feint was vigorously maintained with a view to prevent any con centration against General McPherson. To give him support, Kilpatrick's cavalry was ordered to join him, aud Williams' division of the Twentieth Corps was sent to his rear. In the evening, General Hooker was directed to send a division on the following day to widen the road through the gap, to facili tate the passage of troops and trains. General McPherson passed through Snake Creek Gap, and reached the vicinity of Resaca at 2 p. m. on the 9th. Finding the place \" fortified and manned,\" and no roads through the forest to the railroad, while his flank was exposed to attack from the direction of Dalton, he withdrew to the debouche of the gap through which he had passed. During the afternoon of the 9th, General Johnston learned that two corps of the national army were in the gap, and sent General Hood to Resaca with three divisions. When General Sherman learned that McPherson had not touched Johnston's communications and had withdrawn to the gap, he made a change of plan. He desired, from the first, to hold Johnston at Dalton, and entertained the hope that McPherson's movement would so interrupt his communica tions that he would be forced to give battle at Dalton \u2014 an issue that was preferred to operations \" far down into Georgia.\" His instructions to General McPherson were to secure Snake Creek Gap, and from it make a bold attack on the enemy's"], [65, "51 THE TURNING OF DALTON. flauk or his railroad at any point between Tilton and Dalton. He said : \" I hope the enemy will fight at Dalton ; in which case he can have no force there that can interfere with you ; but should his policy be to fall back along the railroad, you will hit him in flank. Do not fail in that event to make the most of the opportunity, by the most vigorous attack possi ble, as it may save us what we have most reason to appre hend \u2014 a slow pursuit, in which he gains strength as we lose it. In either event, you may be sure the forces north of you will prevent his turning on you alone. In the event of hearing the sounds of heavy battle about Dalton, the greater necessity for your rapid movement on the railroad. If broken to an extent that would take some days to repair, you can with draw to Snake Creek Gap, and come to us or await the devel opment, according to your judgment or the information you may receive.\" As soon as he learned that General McPherson had failed to accomplish any of these objects, except to attain position at the debouche of the gap, he determined to attack with his armies through the gap, and issued orders for the movement. It was plain to General Sherman, as it had been to General Thomas, in February, that no effort should be made to dis lodge the enemy from Buzzard Roost, by direct attack ; but he continued the feint, in order to still hold Johnston at Dal ton, that he might throw his armies upon his rear. Snake Creek Gap made it easy to turn Dalton, by an army strong enough to uncover its communications, or to detach sufficient forces to risk an engagement with the enemy's whole army. Through this gap all the fortresses north of Dalton could be evaded, and the army in passage be under the cover of the mountains. Had Johnston's army been strong enough for division to hold the positions north of Dalton, and the lower mouth of the gap, he could have defied a hundred thousand men. But as his safety demanded the concentration of his army on his lines of retreat and supply, he was compelled to leave the passage undefended, and make roads for the quick transfer of his army from Dalton to Reseca, should his antag onist use the gap for a flank movement. General Sherman's"], [66, "52 THE TURNING OF DALTON. orders to effect this measure required the concentration of his armies in Snake Creek Gap, on the 12th. When General Johnston first learned that General McPher son had retired from Resaca, he recalled Hood's three divis ions, and on the 11th his army was again concentrated at Dalton. On the morning of the 12th, he was confronted by Howard's corps and Stoneman's cavalry, the remainder of the national forces being in motion to concentrate in Snake Creek Gap. Stanley's division was before Buzzard's Roost Gap ; Newton's was holding the north end of Rocky Face ridge, and the roads around it ; Wood's was in reserve on Tunuel Hill, and Stoneman's troopers were on Newton's left flank. From the signal station on the ridge, the movements of the enemy were plainly visible. About 10 A. m. a heavy column was seen to advance toward Newton's left, as if to turn it. The menace was of such positive expression that Wood's di vision moved to Newton's support. But the enemy, after driving back Newton's skirmishers, withdrew. General John ston's object, doubtless, was to ascertain whether the national forces had withdrawn from his front, as he had heard the day previous that Resaca was again threatened. The evening before, he had ordered General Polk, who had just arrived with Boring's division, to defend the place with that division, and Canty's brigade. But as his safety depended upon his knowledge of General Sherman's movements, his reconnois sance was directed to this end. During the day, he was so fully assured of the flank movement, that, by a night march, he transferred his infantry and artillery to Resaca, leaving his cavalry to cover his rear. This result was not in harmony with the plans and expecta tions of General Sherman, his object being to hold John ston's army at Dalton, until his own armies could pass through Snake Creek Gap ; but the opportunity to accomplish it was lost between the 9th and the morning of the 13th. On the 9th, Resaca was held by Canty's brigade. The day following, General Hood was there with three divisions. On the 11th, Canty's brigade again held the place, and from the evening of the 11th until the morning of the 13th, General Polk was there with Boring's division in addition to Canty's brigade."], [67, "53 THE TURNING OF DALTON. General McPherson passed through Snake Creek Gap on the 9th, and was on that day with his army within a mile of Res aca, and from the 9th to the 13th, he was south of the gap. On the 11th, Hooker's corps was in supporting distance, and on the 12th, Palmer's corps and Schofield's two divisions were close in the rear of Hooker. Johnston remained in ignorance of Sherman's grand flank movement until the evening of the 12th, and then he was at Daltou with his army. After the national armies had gained Snake Creek Gap, he was unable to ascertain how many troops passed through it. Au army, there, could pass as secretly as a brigade. He said in his official report, that \"Rocky Face Mountain, and Snake Creek Gap, at its south end, completely covered for the enemy the turning of Dalton.\" His ignorance, then, of the movement until the evening of the 12th, was a condition of its success. Had McPherson's army and the forces in his rear, on that day, moved rapidly into position between Resaca and Tilton, Johnston would have been thrown from his communications, or been compelled to give battle upon conditions of great disadvantage. It was unfortunate that Resaca was not gained at the same time that Dalton was turned, as the campaign did not furnish a similar opportunity to defeat Johnston, or press him from his communications. The grandest possibility between Tun nel Hill and Lovejoy's Station invited a prompt advance in force from the debouche of Snake Creek Gap. General Thomas' plan differed from the one adopted by General Sher man. He proposed that the Armies of the Tennesse and the Ohio should hold General Johnston at Dalton, by a feint upon his position at Buzzard's Roost, while the Army of the Cum berland, sixty thousand strong, should pass rapidly through Snake Creek Gap, and fall upon Johnston's communications between Dalton and Resaca, and thus cut him off from his communications, and either drive him eastward into a moun tain region, or force him to give battle on unequal conditions. General Sherman's first plan proposed to demonstrate against Resaca, so as to hold him at Dalton to give battle, or induce General Johnston to abandon Dalton, and then strike his army in flank, while in motion between that place and Resaca."], [68, "54 THE TURNING OF DALTON. This first series of operations in offense and defense gave the types of the campaign. The offensive compelled a choice between the direct attack of fortified positions and the flank movement. The adopted methods of defense were the main tenance of fortified positions as long as practicable, a constant outlook for opportunities to strike insulated columns, and re treat when necessary to save communications. General John ston's leading idea was to fight under cover, and thus reduce the national army until he could meet it on equal conditions of battle, and at Dalton, and almost daily while he held com mand, he gave it revelation. General Sherman's leading ob ject was to entrap or force his enemy into battle under cir cumstances which would not neutralize his superior strength, and of this, his zigzag lines of aggression were the expression. EXTRACT FROM GENERAL GRANT'S OFFICIAL REPORT OF OPERATIONS FROM MARCH, 1864, TO JULY, 1865. The enemy had concentrated the bulk of his forces east of the Missis sippi into two armies, commanded by Generals R. E. Lee and J. E. John ston, his ablest and best generals. The army commanded by Lee occupied the south bank of the Rapidan, extending from Mine run westward,. strongly intrenched, covering and defending Richmond, the rebel capital, against the Army of the Potomac. The army under Johnston occupied a strongly intrenched position at Dalton, Georgia, covering and defend ing Atlanta, Georgia, a place of great importance as a railroad center, against the armies under Major-General Sherman. These two armies and the cities covered by them and defended by them, were the main objective points of the campaign. General Sherman was instructed to move against Johnston's army to break it up, and to go irito the interior of the enemy's country as far as he could, inflicting all the damage he could upon their war resources. If the enemy in his front showed signs of joining Lee, to follow him up to the full extent of his ability, while I would prevent the concentration of Lee upon him, if it was in the power of the Army of the Potomac to do so.

You may at once commence your preparations, and give orders that the force left here is to be under the command of the senior officer, who will strip his command light, sending all spare wagons to Ringgold ; that the cars run daily to this point with daily supplies, but the main stores to be at Ringgold; that the cavalry watch well the passes north of Tunnel Hill, and at Ray's Gap ; and that in case the enemy detect the diminu tion of force, and attack, gradually withdraw in the direction of Ring gold, but defend that point at all costs; that a locomotive and construc tion train be kept here with orders, and prepared, if this retrograde movement be made necessary ; that the party shall take up, at intervals, rails, so as to make a repair train necessary to replace them \u2014 this, that the enemy may not have the track to facilitate his movement in pursuit. A few rails should at once be removed at some point east of the tunnel, that can again be put down when we want it done. The pass at Snake creek is represented as very narrow. Please instruct a division to be there to-morrow, provided with axes and spades, so as to widen the road as to enable the passage of wagons ; also to facilitate the march of troops by roads and paths outside the wagon track.

As soon as General Stoneman comes, I will cause him to relieve Colonel McCook on that flank, so that you may send him to replace General Geary at Ray's road.

General: \u2014 I think you are satisfied that your troops can not take Rocky Face ridge, and also the attempt to put our columns into the jaws of Buzzard Roost would be fatal to us. Two plans suggest themselves : 1. By night, to replace Schofield's present command by Stoneman's cavalry, which should be near at hand, and to move rapidly your entire army, the men along the base of John's Mountain by the Mill Creek road to Snake Creek Gap, and join McPherson while the wagons are moved to Villanow. When we are joined to McPherson, to move from Sugar valley on Resaca, interposing ourselves between that place and Dalton. Could your army and McPherson's surely whip Joe Johnston ? 2. I cast loose from the railroad altogether, and move the whole army on the same objective point, leaving Johnston to choose his course. Give orders for all your troops to be ready with three days' provisions, and to be prepared to march to-night. I expect to hear from McPherson and Schofield as to their situation, also as to the near approach of Stone man. He was at Charleston yesterday, and is apprized of the necessity for haste. Do you think any danger to McPherson should make us de lay one day ? Please give me the beriefit of your opinion on these points. Yours, etc., W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General Commanding.

Buzzard Roost Gap, through which the railroad passes, is naturally and artificially too strong to be attempted. I must feign on Buzzard Roost, but pass through Snake Creek Gap, and place myself between Johnston and Resaca, where we will have to fight it out. I am making the preliminary move. Certain that Johnston can make no detachments, I will be in no hurry. My cavalry is just approaching from Kentucky and Tennessee, detained by difficulty of getting horses, and even now it is less than my minimum. W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General Commanding. Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, Tunnell Hill, Ga., May 11, 1864. General: \u2014 I received by courier in the night yours of 5 and 6.30 p. m. of yesterday. You will also, during the night, come to the same con clusion. You have now your twenty-three thousand, and General Hooker is close in support, so that you can hold all Joe Johnston's army in check should he abandon Dalton. He can 't abandon Dalton, for he has fixed it up so well for us, and he observes we are close at hand, waiting for him to quit. He can't afford a detachment strong enough to fight you, as his army will not admit of it. Strengthen your position, fight anything that comes, and threaten the safety of the railroad all the time. But to tell the truth, I would rather he would stay in Dalton two more days, when he will find a larger party than he expects, in an open field. At all events we can then choose our ground, and he will be forced to move out of his works. I do not intend to put a column into Buzzard Roost Gap at present. See that you are in easy communication with me and all headquarters. After to-day supplies will be at Ringgold. Yours, W. T. SHERMAN, Major- General Commanding.

The object of the movement for to-morrow is to interpose between the enemy and Resaca, and to break his communications. I. Major-General McPherson will move his column directly on Resaca, occupying in force the hills on this side of Camp creek, and his left ex tending along up Camp creek. He will prepare to advance a part of his force from his left to the railroad, and break it, and then fall back to his line. II. Major-General Thomas will follow close to General McPherson, and when he reaches a main road crossing to the Resaca road, about two miles this side of town, viz., the Dalton and Calhoun road, he will turn to the left toward Dalton, prepared to deploy forward and connect on his right with General McPherson's left, choosing strong positions to cover the movement on the railroad. III. Major-General Schofield will follow General Thomas, and at the first Dalton road, known as the Dalton and Rome road, will turn to the left and advance to abreast of General Thomas, and connect with him. General Schofield will leave one brigade in Snake Creek Gap, about five miles east of Villanow, and the balance of the one division in General McPherson's intrenched camp at this point. . IV, The cavalry of General Garrard will picket all roads to our rear and in case of being threatened from the north, will come into Snake Creek Gap, and cover the rear of the army and the wagon train. The cavalry of General Kilpatrick will move south of the main road to Resaca, and be held in reserve near the forks of the road, and be sub ject to the orders of the commander-in-chief. V. All trains will be brought in Snake Creek Gap, and be placed in convenient order off the road. Greats care must be observed in keeping the road clear, and ambulances and wagons when not traveling the road, must invariably turn out and leave all the road clear. Each army com mander will leave his own wagon guards, and the men should leave their knapsacks in camp. VI. The movement will begin at six (6) o'clock a. m. to-morrow. ' By order of Major-General W.

Your messenger will find me where there is most noise of artillery, or near Resaca. You can safely move on parallel roads, by brigades. Let your packs follow on the heels of the column. Pick up whatever of provisions and plunder you can. W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General Commanding. EXTRACT FROM GENERAL SHERMAN'S REPORT. Speaking of the demonstration against Rocky Face ridge, he says : \" This, however, was only designed as a demonstration, and worked well, for General McPherson was thereby enabled to march within a mile of Resaca unopposed. He found Resaca too strong to be carried by assault, and although there were many good roads from north to south, endanger ing *li is left flank from the direction of Dalton, he could find no road by which he could rapidly cross over to the railroad, and accordingly he fell back and took strong position near the west end of Snake Creek Gap. I was somewhat disappointed at the result; still, appreciated the advantage gained, and on the 10th ordered General Thomas to send General Hook er's corps to Snake Creek Gap in support of General McPherson, and to follow with another corps, the Fourteenth, General Palmer's, leaving Gen eral Howard, with the Fourth Corps, to continue to threaten Dalton in front, while the rest of the army moved rapidly through Snake Creek Gap. On the same day General Schofield was ordered to follow by the same route, and on the 11th the whole arm}', excepting General Howard's corps and some cavalay left to watch Dalton, was in motion on the west side of Rocky Face ridge, for Snake Creek Gap and Resaca. The next day we. moved against Resaca, General McPherson on the direct road, preceded by General Kilpatrick's cavalry ; General Thomas to come up on his left, and General Schofield on his. General Kilpatrick met and drove the enemy's cavalry from a cross-road within two miles of Resaca, but received a wound which disabled him and gave the command of his brigade to Colonel Murray, who according to his orders wheeled out of the road, leaving General McPherson to pass. General McPherson struck the enemy's infantry pickets near Resaca, and drove them within their fortified lines, and occupied a ridge of bald hills, his right on the Oostanaula, about two miles below the railroad bridge, and his left abreast the town. General Thomas came up on his left, facing Camp creek, and General Schofield broke his way through the dense forest to General Thomas' left. Johnston had left Dalton, and General Howard entered it, and pressed his rear. Nothing saved Johnston's army at"], [75, "61 THE TURNING OF DALTON. Resaca but the impracticable nature of the eountry, which made the pas sage of troops across the valley almost impossible. This fact enabled his army to reach Resaca from Dalton along the comparatively good roads constructed beforehand, partly from the topographical nature of the country, and partly from the foresight of the rebel chief. At all events on the 14th of May, we found the rebel army in a strong position behind Camp creek, occupying the forts of Resaca, and his right on some high chestnut hills to the north of the town.\" EXTRACT FROM GENERAL THOMAS' REPORT TO THE \" COMMIT- TEE OF CONGRESS ON THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR.\" Shortly after his assignment to the command of the Military Division of the Mississippi, General Sherman came to see me at Chattanooga, to consult as to the position of affairs, and adopt a plan for a spring cam paign. At that interview, I proposed to General Sherman that if he would use McPherson's and Schofield's armies to demonstrate on the enemy's position at Dalton, by the direct roads through Buzzard Roost Gap, and from the direction of Cleveland, I would throw my whole force through Snake Creek Gap, which I knew to be unguarded, fall upon the enemy's communications between Dalton and Resaca, thereby turning his position completely, and force him either to retreat toward the east, through a difficult country, poorly supplied with provisions and forage, with a strong probability of total disorganization of his force, or attack me, in which latter event, I felt confident that my army was sufficiently strong to beat him, especially as I hoped to gain position on his commu nications before he could be made aware of my movement. General Sherman objected to this plan, for the reason that he desired my army to form the reserve of the united armies, and to serve as a rallying point for the two wings, the Army of the Ohio and that of the Tennessee, to operate from. EXTRACT FROM GENERAL THOMAS' OFFICIAL REPORT. General Hooker was directed to send another division of his command to Snake Creek Gap, with instructions to repair the road through the gap, so as to facilitate the passage of infantry and wagons. On the 11th, it was decided to leave one corps, Howard's, supported by Stoneman's and McCook's divisions of cavalry, and move to Snake Creek Gap with the balance of the army, attacking the enemy in front from that quarter, whilst Howard was keeping up the impression of a direct attack at Buzzard's Roost. This movement was to commence on the 12th. In structions were given to corps commanders to provide their commands with ten days' rations and a good supply of ammunition, sending all surplus wagons back to Ringgold. At 9 a. m. on the 13th, General How ard's command occupied Dalton, it having been evacuated by the enemy on the evening of the 12th. Concentrating his troops in Dalton, General Howard pursued the enemy along the railroad, in the direction of Resaca."], [76, "62 THE TURNING OF DALTON. capturing a considerable number of prisoners. The concentration of the balance of the army in Snake Creek Gap having been completed by the night of the 12th, at 8 a. M. on the 13th, Hooker's corps, preceded by Kilpatrick's cavalry, moved out on the Resaca road in support of Mc- Pherson's troops threatening Resaca. EXTRACT FROM GENERAL HOWARD'S REPORT. May 11th, the troops of the corps were disposed as follows: General Stanley to hold the gap; General Newton to hold Rocky Face, and the roads leading around the north end of it, with General Stoneman's cavalry covering his left flank ; and General Wood in reserve on Tunnel Hill. During the evening of this day, and on the morning of the 12th, the general movement was progressing, and the Fourth Corps found itself alone confronted by the whole rebel army. EXTRACTS FROM GENERAL JOS. E. JOHNSTON'S REPORT. At Dalton, the great numerical superiority of the enemy made the chances of battle much against us, and even if beaten, they had a safe refuge behind the fortified pass of Ringgold, and in the fortress of Chat tanooga. Our refuge, in case of defeat, was in Altanta, one hundred miles off, with three intervening rivers. Therefore, victory for us could not have been decisive, while defeat would have been utterly disastrous. On the 5th of May, this army was in line between Ringgold and Tun nel Hill, and after skirmishing on that day and the following day, on the 7th, pressed back our advanced forces to Mill Creek Gap. On the same day, Canty reached Resaca with his brigade, and was halted there. On the 8th, at 4 p. m., a division of Hooker's corps attacked Dug Gap, which was bravely held by two regiments of Reynolds' Arkansas brigade and Grigsby's brigade of Kentucky cavalry, fighting on foot, until the arrival of Lieutenant-General Hardee, with Granbury's brigade, when the enemy was put to flight. On the 9th, five assaults were made on Lieutenant- General Hood's troops on Rocky Face Mountain. All were repulsed. In the afternoon, a report was received that Logan's and Dodge's corps were in Snake Creek Gap. Three divisions, under Lieutenant-General Hood, were therefore sent to Resaca. On the 10th, Lieutenant-General Hood reported the enemy retiring. Skirmishing to our advantage continued all day, near Dalton. Major-General Bate repulsed a vigorous attack at night. On the 11th, Brigadier-General Canty reported that the enemy was again approaching Resaca. Lieutenant-General Polk arrived in the evening with Loring's division, and was instructed to defend the place with those troops and Canty's. The usual skirmishing continued near Dalton. Rocky Face Mountain and Snake Creek Gap, at its south end, com pletely covered for the enemy the operation of turning Dalton. On the"], [77, "63 THE TURNING OF DALTON. 12th, the Federal army, covered by the mountain, moved by Snake Creek Gap toward Resaca. Major-General Wheeler, with 2,200 of ours, attacked and defeated more than double that number of Federal cavalry, near Varneli's Station. At night, our artillery and infantry marched for Re saca. The cavalry followed on the 13th. On that day, the enemy ap proaching on the Snake Creek Gap road was checked by Loring's troops, which gave time for the formation of Hardee's and Hood's corps, just arriving. As the army was formed, the left of Polk's corps was on the Oostanaula, and the right of Hood's on Connasauga. There was brisk skirmishing during the afternoon on Polk's front and Hardee's left."], [78, "CHAPTER XXVII. BATTLE OF RESACA. Early on the morning of the 13th, General Howard dis covered that General Johnston had withdrawn from Dalton, and he at once occupied the town, having driven his cavalry from it. He then moved in pursuit, and skirmishing as he advanced, encamped eight miles toward Resaca. In the morning, General Johnston reached Resaca, Loring's divisiou having moved out to check General McPherson and give time for the formation of Hood's and Hardee's corps upon their arrival from Dalton. He formed his army, now stronger by several thousand men than at Dalton, with Polk's corps on the left, resting on the Oostanaula river below the town, Har dee's in the center, and Hood's on the right, his right flank resting on the Connasauga river. At 8 a. m., Hooker's corps, preceded by Kilpatrick's cavalry, moved out upon the Resaca road, in support of McPherson, who was advancing against the town. Kilpatrick encountered \"Wheeler and drove him nearly to the town, when, being wounded, he turned over the command to Colonel Murray. Palmer's corps moved from Snake Creek Gap, two miles northeast of Hooker, and then moved parallel with the Resaca road, under orders to proceed as far as the railroad. On reach ing the vicinity of the railroad, his skirmishers encountered those of the enemy, strongly posted on the hills, immediately west of the railroad, and warmly engaged them until night fall. Butterfield's division of Hooker's corps moved forward to support Palmer's right. Schofield's two divisions advanced upon Palmer's left. Howard advanced to the vicinity of Re saca, and when communications were established throughout (64)"], [79, "BATTLE OF RESACA. 65 the line, it was found that his right was but a mile from Scho field's left. General Johnston's position was a strong one, with Camp creek in front, and heavy intrenchments in the immediate vicinity of the town \u2014 the strongest to defend the bridges across the Oostanaula, and cover the retreat of his army. His outer defenses consisted of detached redoubts, and extensive rifle trenches, and the ground beyond was favorable for defense. His army was disposed partly in the inner defenses, but mainly on the high hills north and west of the town, which were for tified. \u25a0 \u00bb Before delivering battle, General Sherman ordered a pon toon bridge to be thrown across the Oostanaula at Lay's ferry, in the direction of Calhoun, Sweeny's division of the Fif teenth Corps to cross and threaten that place, and Garrard's division of cavalry to move from Villanow toward Rome, to cross the Oostanaula, and if possible break the railroad below Calhoun and above Kingston. On the 14th, General Mc- Pherson crossed Camp creek, near its mouth, and forced Polk's corps from the hills commanding the railroad bridges from the west, and secured a lodgment close to his works. This done, it became necessary to swing round the whole line formed the previous evening, from Hooker's left to the extreme left. This movement was made with the right of Johnson's division, which was the right of the Fourteenth Corps, as a pivot, and each division advanced until it encountered the enemy. As Johnson's right was in proximity to the enemy, the di visions to the left met the enemy in succession. Baird's division was in line on Johnson's left, and Davis in reserve. General Howard, in compliance with orders from General Thomas, moved in the morning, to form his corps on the left of Schofield, and advance upon the main roads to Resaca. Newton's division, followed by Wood's, moved toward Scho field's left, and Stanley's toward the enemy's extreme right, on the Fulton and Resaca road. \"When Newton gained Scho field's left, \"Wood changed direction to the left, upon a road between Newton and Stanley. vol. n \u2014 5"], [80, "66 BATTLE OF RESACA. Carlin's brigade of Johnson's division was the first to en- counter the foe. General Carlin crossed Camp creek and advanced some distance over the open ground in front of the enemy's position, under a severe fire of artillery and musketry. The passage of the creek disordered his lines somewhat, and being hopeless of holding the enemy's works should he suc- ceed in an assault, he withdrew, and found shelter and a par- apet at the bank of the stream. Here he maintained position all day, and delivered a desultory but destructive fire. Gen- eral King, perceiving Carlin's repulse, halted his brigade to the left and rear. The ground over which the left of Baird's division and the right of Schofield's line advanced, was thickly wooded, rendering it difficult to maintain lines, and the troops farther to the left having gained ground, those having been delayed moved forward rapidly as they emerged from the woods upon the open space before the enemy's intrenchments; but such was the severity of the musketry and artillery fire to which they were exposed, that they were soon compelled to retreat. Some isolated squads had passed Camp creek, and were driven back ; others were so delayed by the miry banks that they could not withdraw with the main line, and were compelled to seek cover at the stream. To cover the retreat and re-formation of Turchin's brigade, and Schofield's right, Mitchell's brigade of Davis' division, in reserve, moved quickly to the left, and was severely engaged, while the broken lines were reformed upon the high ground west of the creek. As the lines of advance of Howard's corps were con- verging, the three divisions made close connection before reaching the enemy's position, and as the convergence of the roads shortened the battle front continually, the greater por- tion of Newton's division fell in rear of Schofield's right, in reserve, aud when his left carried the position in its front, Newton moved to the relief of his left center, and grasped firmly all the ground that had been gained. In the meantime, \"Wood came abreast of Newton, and drove the enemy from his rifle-pits, and Stanley formed his division on \"Wood's left, with one brigade across the Fulton road, to protect his flank. These movements were all slowly made, in consequence of dense woods and rough ground, and the resistance of the"], [81, "BATTLE OF RESACA. 67 \u2022enemy. But an advanced line was gained, and from it artil lerists poured a fire so destructive as in some cases to drive the enemy temporarily from his works. General Johnston, fearing that the lines of investment were closing around him, determined to assume the offensive, and if possible turn General Sherman's left flank. General Stan ley soon observed indications of the movement. As General Howard had no reserves to direct to the endangered flank, he communicated in person with General Thomas aud secured immediate assistance from the Twentieth Corps. In compli ance with orders, General Hooker promptly dispatched Wil liams' division, under the guidance of Colonel Morgan,* of the Fourteenth Colored regiment, and preceeded it to the point of danger. \"Williams moved rapidly on the most direct route, and arrived on the extreme left just as that flank had been turned and pressed back. Stanley had exhausted all his re serves in extending his line against the overlapping of the enemy. Simonsou's battery, by effective execution, was re tarding the advance of the enemy to double up the line, when \"Williams deployed his division and advanced to the support of the battery. His terrific fire first checked and then routed the enemy, and completely defeated this attempt at flanking. The other divisions of the Twentieth Corps, Geary's and But terfield's, followed Williams, later in the evening, and Mc- Cook's cavalry passed to Hooker's left. The enemy's troops engaged against the left flank were Stevenson's and Stewart's divisions and two brigades of Walk er's \u2014 a strong column in view of the length of Johnston's lines and the relative inferiority of his army. Another fact evinced his estimate of the importance of the movement. After its failure he gave orders for its repetition the next morning, but was subsequently led to revoke them, when he learned that the national infantry were crossing the Oostanaula river, near Calhoun, on a pontoon bridge. To provide against this men ace to his rear, he dispatched General Walker to Calhoun. Such advantages had been gained during the day as prom ised success in forcing Johnston to abandon his position, and * Colonel T. J. Morgan was volunteer aid to General Howard."], [82, "68 BATTLE OF RESACA. orders were issued for a general advance the next morning. Notwithstanding this aggressive purpose, the troops covered themselves with the usual defenses. There was no change in the line, except that Schofield was directed to withdraw from the center and pass to Hooker's left. There was delay in\" making the attack in the morning, to await the result of a reconnoissance by General Geary, from the left flank. Full preparations were not completed until noon. At this hour the Twentieth Corps advanced \u2014 Geary on the right, Butterfield on the left, and Williams in reserve. Before the enemy's works were reached, General Hooker di rected General Williams to deflect to the left to cover and protect that flank, again threatened by the enemy, as Gen eral Johnston, having learned that there was no immediate danger from infantry at Calhoun, had repeated his order to General Hood to advance against the national left. Facing to the east, Williams' division moved to the point menaced \u2014 Knipe's brigade on the right, Ruger's in the center, and Rob inson's on the left. The ground traversed by the advancing columns was hilly, with woods and open spaces alternating. Williams' brigades formed lines on a series of hills west of the railroad and running parallel to it ; batteries were planted with supports to command the ground in front of the liue. The enemy before Hooker, occupied intrenched hills, having spurs extending in all directions, and batteries were so placed on the higher points as to enfilade assaulting lines. Geary's and Butterfield's divisions advanced with spirit, and though receiving a heavy fire from artillery and musketry, carried the nearest hills. Then Butterfield's division \u2014 Ward's, Coburn's, and Wood's brigades \u2014 supported by Ireland's brigade on Geary's left, drove the enemy from a battery, which from a ruling position was pouring an exceedingly destructive fire ; but another line of intrenchments was so near that the cap tors could neither remove the guns nor remain with them. But, withdrawing to tenable ground, they covered the guns so fully with their fire that the enemy could not approach them, and during the remainder of the day the guns remained between the lines. They were taken during the night by a detachment of the Fifth Ohio under Colonel Kilpatrick. In the meantime, the entire line became engaged, from How-"], [83, "BATTLE OF RESACA. 69 ard's right to Hooker's left; while throughout the whole front of the \" Army of the Cumberland,\" heavy skirmishing and artillery action was maintained. General Howard, being nearest the assaulting corps, kept up a constant fire of artil lery and musketry, and iu one instance made a positive attack, and although he did not succeed in holding any point of the enemy's line, he prevented the diversion of troops from his front, to sustain their comrades before General Hooker, against whose left they were maintaining the offensive with great de termination. Near the railroad, in front of Williams, he massed his forces and advancing as much as possible under cover, made repeated assaults, but was unable to disturb the line. Williams' artillery was used with most destructive effect in the repulsion of these assaults. In front of Williams' right and Geary's left, there was a long cleared field, compassing two hills and a ravine, and extending to a wooded hill, upon which rested the enemy's main line. This field was flanked on the right by wooded hills, which extended to the captured battery. About 5 p. m. Stevenson's division left the main line and charged in column to gain possession of these lateral hills. This movement, if successful, would have insulated one half of Geary's division, which had been concentrated under Colonel Cobham, in the rear of the guns wrested from the enemy. But Stevenson was repulsed mainly through the con centration of fire from Williams' right and Geary's left. His leading regiments were almost annihilated. On both sides, artillery charged with canister and schrapnel was freely used. Stevenson's repulse closed the general contest. This attack of Stewart's and Stevenson's divisions was made after General Johnston had decided to evacuate Resaca, but his order for bidding the assault was not received in time to prevent it. During the night of the 15th, General Johnston abandoned Resaca. It was observed by those on the outlook the preced- ing day, that he was sending his material to the rear. He had lost positions on his right and left, and had been pressed throughout his lines by two days of fighting, and the exposure of his communications in the event of a flank movement, which had been foreshadowed, made his retreat necessary. He had attacked the brigade across the river below Resaca on the"], [84, "70 BATTLE OF RESACA. 15th, and had been repulsed, and as General Sherman's front now presented defenses as well as his own, the transfer of heavy forces across the river was plainly practicable. He therefore retreated before embarrassments crowded upon him. The action at Resaca, though presenting different features from the one before Dalton, was not essentially different in type or result. In the latter one, the two armies more fully confronted each other, and there was more fighting and heavier losses. The champaign region of Georgia was now be fore General Sherman, offering freedom for maneuver and strategy, which the mountain region had denied. As the aggregate monthly losses of the Army of the Cum berland were reported by General Thomas, it is impossible to ascertain definitely the casualties at Resaca. The Twentieth Corps lost seventeen hundred and forty-six men, and the other two corps lost nearly as many in the aggregate. General Johnston's losses were also heavy, especially when he assumed the offensive."], [85, "71 CHAPTER XXVIII. ADVANCE TO THE ETOWAH RIVER, THE TURNING OF ALLATOONA, BATTLES NEAR NEW HOPE CHURCH. Resaca was occupied by the Army of the Cumberland on the morning of May 16th, and General Sherman gave orders for rapid pursuit. There was delay, however, in passing the river, as it was necessary to throw a pontoon bridge at Resaca and at points above. During the day, the Army of the Ten nessee crossed at Lay's ferry, and Howard's corps at Resaca. As in the pursuit the Anny of the Cumberland was to follow the enemy's line of retreat, General Howard moved forward toward Calhoun. His progress was slow, as stubborn resist ance was offered by the rear-guard of Johnston's army. The next day, the three armies advanced. Palmer's corps followed Howard's ; Hooker's having crossed above, moved on the left. On his left, was the Army of the Ohio, and the Army of the Tennessee advanced on lines on the right of the central army. Stoneman's cavalry was on the extreme left, and Garrard's on the extreme right, under instructions to reach the enemy's rear if practicable. Early in the day, General Howard found the rear-guard of the enemy, formed of cavalry and artillery, and at times supported by infantry. Three lines were presented at short intervening distances, aud generally behind barricades in woods, with open ground in front. When the first line was pressed from position, the troops forming it passed to the rear of the third and reformed. Thus, not only was the rear of the army covered, but two of the three lines of the rear-guard itself. The Fourth Corps advanced in two columns abreast, and pressed the enemy so strongly in the evening that a bat-"], [86, "72 ETOWAH \u2014 ALLATOONA \u2014 NEW HOPE CHURCH. tie seemed imminent. The skirmish lines were reinforced until they had the weight of lines of battle, and artillery was freely used. The action terminated as darkness approached, and during the night, General Johnston abandoned a position which he had intrenched. His reasons were, that a portion of Polk's corps was yet in the rear ; that, as he thought, the expiration of service of the regiments in the national armies confronting him that had not re-enlisted, would soon reduce their strength, and he hoped that some blunder would give him an opportunity to strike a blow without risking a general battle, or to enter such a contest with advantages to counter balance the inferiority of his army. General Sherman's object now was to compel Johnston to fight north of the Etowah river, divide his army, or give up Rome or Allatoona. In the event of his attempt to hold both these places, he proposed to break his line at Kingston ; or should he concentrate at Kingston, to break his railroads right and left, and \" fight him square in front.\" To give support to the cavalry on the right, he directed General Thomas to send a division from Resaca toward Rome, and Davis' had been put in motion. On the 18th, the armies moved forward without change of order, and at night the Fourth and Fourteenth Corps encamped near Kingston. At 8 a. m. the next day, the central column, Stanley's division leading, advanced toward Cassville. Midway to that place the enemy opened upon Stanley with a six-gun battery, from an eminence, but yielded, under the pressure of an attack with infantry and artillery. Moving in pursuit nearly four miles, Stanley was again arrested. This time there was a formidable combination before him, and the enemy was ob served to be advancing in two lines of battle. Geueral Howard promptly deployed his corps \u2014 Stanley's and Wood's divisions in front, and Newton's in support of the left. As soon as the enemy observed these dispositions, his lines were halted and their front covered with barricades. When Howard's artillery opened, the first line retreated in some confusion, and the Fourth Corps advanced and occupied the position. Here a junction with Hooker's corps was made, which had engaged the enemy during the day on the direct road from Adairsville"], [87, "73 ETOWAH \u2014 ALLATOONA \u2014 NEW HOPE CHURCH. to Cassville. Skirmishing was maintained until dark, when the three corps bivouacked in close proximity. During the day, General Schofield approached Cassville, and General McPher son moved from Woodland to Kingston. As reports had reached General Sherman that General John ston had been reinforced, he thought it probable that he would now give battle in the vicinity of Cassville, and in such expec tation he threw his armies from their parallel lines of march, toward the head of the central column. His cavalry was on right and left, in effort to break the railroad in Johnston's rear to force him to battle, or to subject a portion of his army and trains to capture, before he could cross the Etowah river. Gen eral Schofield was under instructions to support the cavalry on the left, in the accomplishment of this object, and during the day, McCook's division of cavalry had a brilliant passage of arms with Stevenson's division of infantry. It was General Johnston's-purpose to give battle at Cassville. He had been joined by French's division of Polk's corps, and the lines which Howard first encountered were Hood's, who had orders to attack. His lieutenant, however, under the im pression that the columns on the east had turned his position, refrained until it was too late to overpower the head of column. Even after this failure, General Johnston meditated delivering battle, but was dissuaded by his lieutenants, Polk and Hood, though General Hardee gave counter advice. During the night he crossed the Etowah with all his trains, and moved to his strong position at Allatoona Pass. This step was a matter of subsequent regret to him, though it is probable that his sorrow would have been more profound, had he engaged Sherman's three armies at Cassville. Pending these greater movements, General Davis with his division captured Rome. His orders did not require him to go so far from the line of march, but as circumstances, in his judg ment, justified the step, and having advised General Thomas of his purpose, he passed beyond all co-operation with the cav alry, and hurried Mitchell's brigade in advance, on the 17th, drove back the rebel cavalry, and deployed within range of the artillery, on De Soto hill, on the west side of the Oostanaula. McCook's brigade and Morgan's moved forward, and the enemy,"], [88, "74 ETOWAH \u2014 ALLATOONA \u2014 NEW HOPE CHURCH. at first assuming the aggressive, was driven within his fortifi cations. The next morning the city was abandoned in too much hurry to destroy machine-shops and iron-works of great value, and vast quantities of stores and cotton, and six pieces of artillery. General Davis lost in killed and wounded one hundred and fifty men. BEYOND THE ETOWAH. General Sherman did not pursue beyond the Etowah. The rough hills and gorges around Allatoona presented such ob stacles to maneuver and attack as to deter him from a direct advance. He chose rather to make a detour to the right, to turn Allatoona, or throw his armies upon Johnston's com munications at Marietta or the Chattahoochee river. He ac cordingly gave orders for a few days of rest, and time to repair the railroad to Cassville, and accumulate supplies at Resaca. At this period, General Johnston was calling to him in fantry from the Southwest and cavalry from Mississippi, aud General Sherman was making effort to maintain his relative superiority. His losses and constantly lengthening line of supply were reducing his offensive strength, and he called all available troops from the rear. May 23d, he ordered General Blair, with two divisions of infantry of the Seventeenth Corps, and Long's brigade of cavalry of Garrard's division, to move on Rome and Kingston, from Huntsville, Alabama. On this day, he put his armies in motion south of the Etowah. The Army of the Tennessee crossed the river at the mouth of Conasene creek, on a bridge which had been saved from destruction, and advanced toward Dallas by Van Wert. General Thomas crossed four miles south of Kingston, and moved through Euharley and Stilesboro. Geueral Schofield crossed near Etowah cliffs, and kept on the left of General Thomas. Each army had supplies for twenty days in wagons. McCook's division of cavalry preceded the central columns, and reached Stilesboro in the afternoon, and finding the enemy there in force, with cavalry and infantry, skirmished until dark. Hooker, Howard, and Palmer encamped south of Euharley creek. Kilpatrick's division, Colonel W. W. Lowe commanding, was left to guard the line of the Etowah \u2014 an im-"], [89, "75 ETOWAH \u2014 ALLATOONA \u2014 NEW HOPE CHURCH. portant duty, as Wheeler's cavalry had been sent to interrupt communications north of that river. Garrard's division was covering General McPherson's right flank. At daylight on the 24th, by direction of General Thomas, General Hooker sent Geary's division to Euharley creek, to hold the Alabama road toward Allatoona, and cover the left flank of the corps, until relieved by General Schofield. The remainder of the Twentieth Corps was directed to advance to Burnt Hickory, preceded by McCook's cavalry. The cavalry commander, upon arrival, was instructed to picket strongly the roads leading toward Alatoona, and cover the movements of the army. McCook reached Burnt Hickory at 2 p. m., having skirmished with the enemy for several miles. In this skirmish he captured a rebel courier, bearing dispatches from General Johnston to a division commander of cavalry, re quiring him to observe the movements of the national forces toward Burnt Hickory, and advising him that his army was moving toward Dallas and Powder Springs. Later in the day, General Garrard informed General Thomas that in moving upon Dallas, he had been attacked by Bate's division, the advance of Hardee's corps. Thus, from two sources, the fact was ascertained that General Johnston had divined Gen eral Sherman's purpose in time to throw his army before him near Dallas. At night, the Fourth and Twentieth Corps en camped at Burnt Hickory ; the Fourteenth, impeded by trains, halted some distance in the rear. The next morning, the march was resumed. McCook's cavalry moved on the road to Golgotha, followed by Butter field's division. Hooker's other two divisions, and Howard's corps, advanced on roads running south of Butterfield's line of march. General Howard sought roads to the right, to avoid the main roads, upon which the trains of Johnson's di vision and the Twentieth Corps were advancing. Baird's division was left at Burnt Hickory, to protect trains and the rear of the army. The divisions of the Army of the Cumber land, marching upon four roads, were under orders to con verge upon Dallas, as it was not expected that Johnston's army would be met nearer than that place. But at 11 A. m. Geary's division, the central one of the Twentieth Corps, came upon"], [90, "76 ETOWAH \u2014 ALLATOONA \u2014 NEW HOPE CHURCH. the enemy in considerable force. A cavalry outpost had been previously found near Owen's Mill, where a burning bridge had caused some delay. After crossing this bridge, General Geary had deployed the Fifth Ohio as skirmishers in ad vance of Candy's brigade, and when within four and a half miles of Dallas, this regiment became heavily engaged, and soon after, a charge was made by the enemy. Candy's brigade was then rapidly deployed, and after a sharp conflict repulsed the foe. General Geary immediately extended his skirmish line, formed Candy's brigade in line of battle, aud brought up Ireland's and Buschbeck's in support. Advancing again, the division drove the enemy a half mile. From prisoners, it was now ascertained that Hood's corps was in front, and that Hardee's was not far distant, in the direction of Dallas. The situation was now critical, as no supporting forces were near. General Hooker, who was with his central division, now di rected that it should be formed upon a hill affording advan tages for defense, that the skirmish line should be extended, and make a show of strength by maintaining an aggressive fire, and that barricades should be constructed. He sent orders immediately to Williams and Butterfield to hasten to Geary's support, and informed General Thomas of the posture of affairs. As Williams and Butterfield wTere several miles distant, they did not reach Geary's position until late in the afternoon. Upon arrival, their divisions advanced against the enemy wTith Geary's in reserve, under instructions from General Sherman to drive him beyond New Hope Church, a point where roads from Marietta, Dallas, and Ackworth meet. Though the country was hilly and covered with trees and undergrowth, Williams' and Butterfield's division, dashed at the enemy at double-quick, and drove him back a mile and a half, to New Hope Church; but here they received his artillery fire at short range, and were arrested. Geary moved to the front again, and though the attack was vigorously made, the enemy was not dislodged. General Johnston had thrown his army directly across General Sherman's line of advance, and was ready for defensive battle. His position was a strong one,"], [91, "77 ETOWAH \u2014 ALLATOONA NEW HOPE CHURCH. and his troops were under cover. The engagement which defined his position resulted in heavy losses to both armies. When General Sherman first learned that the enemy was before him in force, he divined that he was on Johnston's right flank, and proposed to turn it. With this object in view, he directed General McPherson to move to the left, if he could not dislodge the eneny in his front. But General McPherson did not move to the left as projected, and the opportunity to pass round General Johnston's right to Ackworth and Mari etta was lost. General Hooker at night intrenched a line in close prox imity to the enemy. The Fourth Corps, ordered by General Thomas to his support during the day, came up by divisions in the evening and after night, and formed on his left. Davis' division of the Fourteenth Corps, having left Rome on the 24th, was now in supporting distance ; but Johnson's and Baird's divisions, having been delayed by the trains on the roads in advance of them, were still in the rear. The following day was spent in the concentration of the armies. Geueral McPherson's army advanced to Dallas, and General Schofield's was directed to the left of General Thomas, to turn Johnston's right flank. Garrard's cavalry formed the extreme right, Stoneman's the left, and McCook's covered the rear. The Twentieth Corps maintained the position assumed the previous evening. The Fourth was slightly changed by swing ing round to occupy a line of hills, trending at right angles to Hooker's line. This change of front threatened the enemy's right flank more directly. General Schofield, on Howard's left, covered the road leading from Allatoona to Dallas, by New Hope Church. Both Howard and Schofield skirmished into position ; and so close were they to the enemy that not only their skirmishers, but their main lines maintained a con tinuous fire. In the forenoon, General Davis, by direction of General Thomas, made a reconnoissance to Dallas, to determine the position of Johnston's left flank and open communications with General McPherson. He advanced on the Burnt Hickory road with Morgan's brigade in front, drove the enemy's pick-"], [92, "78 ETOWAH \u2014 ALLATOONA NEW HOPE CHURCH. ets through the town, and deployed his division on the east of the Marietta road. Soon after, the Army of the Tennessee came abreast, and was formed in lines, extending across the Villa Rica road. During the day, McCook, on the left, struck a column of cavalry in flank, broke it in two, and captured fifty-two pris oners. From his prisoners he learned that Wheeler's cavalry corps was on Johnston's right flank. In the afternoon, John son's division of the Fourteenth Corps came up in the rear of the Fourth Corps. The opposing armies were now in closest proximity. Har dee's corps was on Johnston's left, Hood's on his right, and Polk's in the center. The batteries of the two armies were placed on the commanding positions in the opposing lines, and nothing was needed to precipitate the work of death but a word from either of the commanding generals. As General Johnston had twice withdrawn his army under circumstances not radically different, General Sherman did not feel confident that he would maintain his position even for a day, and gave such orders as would compass the issues of battle or the retreat of the enemy. He directed General McPherson to connect his left with Hooker's right, so that he could then move his whole line by the left flank beyond John ston's right, and interpose between him and the railroad. In addition to McPherson's movement, a strong demonstration by Hooker and Howard, and a positive attack upon Johnston's right flank, were ordered. The effort to turn this flank commanded the personal atten tion of Generals Sherman and Thomas, in addition to General Howard, who was ordered to furnish the assaulting column. In the beginning, General Sherman designated the point in the enemy's line upon which the assault should be made, but Generals Thomas and Howard, upon special examination, perceived that there the enemy could bring a cross-fire of ar tillery and musketry to bear upon the approaches, and General Howard was directed to move his column to the left, beyond all the troops in line, and endeavor to strike the enemy's flank. Geueral T. J. Wood's division of the Fourth Corps was"], [93, "ETOWAH \u2014 ALLATOONA \u2014 NEW HOPE CHURCH. 79 selected to make the assault, to be supported on the left by General R. W. Johnson's division of the Fourteenth Corps, and by General McLean's brigade of General Schofield's Twenty-third Corps, on the right. The column was formed in the rear of the extreme left of the Twenty-third Corps \u2014 Wood's division in column of six lines deep, Johnson's on the left, with a brigade front. After moving a mile to the east, General Howard supposed that he had reached the ene my's flank, and directed General Wood to wheel his command so as to face the south, aud advance. The enemy's works were 6oon discovered, and upon examination of their strength, the column was moved another mile to the east. Here, Generals Howard and Wood reconnoitered the ground, and ascertained that the line of works did not cover the whole division front, and preparation was made for attack. Johnson's division was slightly refused on Wood's left, with Scribner's brigade in front, and McLean's brigade was sent to a point in full view from the enemy's works, a little to the right of the place of attack, to attract his attention and draw his fire. At 5 p. m. the entire column marched briskly forward, Ha zen's brigade of Wood's division leading, aud having driven back the enemy's skirmishers, assaulted his main line with great vigor. Hazen at first was without support from John son's division on his left, and was so heavily engaged that Geueral Wood was compelled to move up his supporting lines. Scribner's brigade was also hurried forward on Hazen's left, but, before getting abreast of Hazen, was struck in flank from the opposite side of a creek on the left. Colonel Scribner halted, to throw out troops to cover his flank, at the crisis of the assault, and it was soon evident that it had failed. The Confederate general, Cleburne, threw his reserves and an en filading fire upon Wood's left flank, and forced it back, and his right at the same time was subjected to a cross-fire of ar tillery and musketry, and was also without support, as McLean had not shown himself to the enemy nor opened fire. As both of Wood's flanks were melting away under a most de structive fire, General Howard ordered the withdrawal of the column. The retirement was made with such deliberation as permitted the removal of the wounded. General Johnson"], [94, "80 ETOWAH \u2014 ALLATOONA \u2014 NEW HOPE CHURCH. withdrew to the left and rear of the main line, and General Wood to a ridge farther to the front and right. General McLean withdrew entirely, and left the two divisions in com plete isolation. General Wood lost over fourteen hundred men killed, wounded, and missing. General Johnson's loss was slight in comparison, but was himself severely wounded. The reported loss of the enemy was four hundred and fifty. Two advantages resulted from this unsuccessful assault, though dearly purchased. A position was secured far on the enemy's right, which was of importance to subsequent move ments, and it was clearly developed that Johnston's right would be found in strength wherever a column might go to turn it. At night, Wood and Johnson intrenched their re spective positions. During the day, the enemy came out of his works in front of Newton's division, but was handsomely repulsed by Wag ner's and Kimball's brigades. Colonel Daniel McCook's bri gade of General Davis' division seized a mountain pass in the rebel center, and held it against a night attack by troops from Polk's corps. General McPherson found it impracticable to move to the left, in compliance with General Sherman's orders. General Johnston was meditating offensive action, and pressed the na tional lines throughout their length in search for an opportu nity to strike an effective blow. Each commander was watch ing for an advantage, and yet each was \" duly cautious in the obscurity of the ambushed ground.\" During the 28th, there was brisk skirmishing from flank to flank. General Sherman was waiting for McPherson's movement to the left, to make effort to turn General Johnston's position, and the latter was planning a battle for the next day. At night, General Hood was instructed to attack the national left the next morning at dawn, and the remainder of the army was ordered to join in the action, successively from right to left. General Hood advanced, but finding an intrenched flank, refrained from attack and asked for instructions. As this delay defeated the surprise, that was intended, in the initia tive, Hood was recalled. But in the evening General John-"], [95, "ETOWAH \u2014 ALLATOONA NEW HOPE CHURCH. 81 ston attacked McPherson, as he was in effort to leave position to close up on the center of the national line. Fortunately the Army of the Tennessee had not moved far from the de fenses, and repulsed Hardee's corps with great loss. As a feint, to cover the assault upon McPherson, the enemy demon strated in front of Stanley and Newton, and at intervals during the day there was artillery action and skirmishing throughout the battle front. As General McPherson did not change position, there were only slight changes at other points in the line. A brigade of Stanley's division was thrown between Schofield and Wood, and Colonel J. G. Mitchell's brigade of Davis' division was placed in position about half-way toward General Hooker. The chasm here was three miles wide. Colonel Mitchell in trenched thoroughly, and cut roads to his rear to facilitate the closing up of the right wing upon the center at New Hope Church. The purpose to move the whole line to the left was not abandoned by General Sherman, though the repeated attempts of General McPherson to leave position, during the last days of the month, invited the enemy's attacks. During the month of May, the Army of the Cumberland lost about nine thousand men. Sixty-six officers and ten hun dred and ninety enlisted men were killed ; three hundred and one officers, and six thousand four hundred and fifty-one en listed men were wounded, and eight officers and eight hundred and fifty-eight men were missing from the three corps of in fantry. Colonels A. S. McDougall, One Hundred and Twenty third New York, and John H. Patrick, Fifth Ohio, fell at New Hope Church, and Colonel Gilbert, Nineteenth Michigan, was mortally wounded ; Lieutenant-Colonel E. F. Lloyd, One Hun dred and Nineteenth New York, was killed at Resaca. The army captured one thousand four hundred and seventy-seven prisoners, and received five hundred and fifty deserters. As General Sherman had held his armies before General Johnston, near Dallas, he had not made effort to ascertain with what force Allatoona was held, to turn which stronghold was his primary object in moving his armies to the right. He vol. h \u2014 6"], [96, "\u25a082 ETOWAH \u2014 ALLATOONA \u2014 NEW HOPE CHURCH. had ordered General Blair to move to that point, but on the first of June he was still far in the rear. But as at this time General McPherson effected his own dislodgment from the position that had been so closely watched by the enemy, and the united armies could move by the left flank, General Sher man ordered General Garrard to move to the east end of Allatoona Pass, and General Stoneman to the west with, in structions to fight cavalry with cavalry, and infantry with dismounted cavalry. As General McPherson's army, by divisions, approached New Hope Church, the divisions of the Twentieth Corps moved to the left of Johnson's division, which had held the extreme left since the 27th of May. Davis' division relieved Hovey's of the Twenty-third Corps, and Baird's advanced from Burnt Hickory to Johnson's rear. Schofield's troops passed to Hooker's left. At night, Garrard and Stoneman were at Allatoona. On the 2d, Hooker moved to the left of Schofield, and Baird moved to Johnson's left, when Hooker, Schofield, and Baird moved on a right wheel, drove back the enemy's skirmishers, and threw General Johnston farther from the roads leading to Ackworth and Allatoona ; and yet, in front of the new posi tions on the left, finished defenses were found. The move ments of the day were embarrassed by a rain-storm, which flushed the creeks and softened the ground. During the 4th and 5th, the national line was gradually ex tended to the left, and by successive steps was advanced to Johnston's immediate front. From first to last, each army fortified as it advanced, and the field-works from Dallas far toward Ackworth revealed to the future the proximity and nature of the belligerence of the two armies. When at last General Johnston perceived that General Sherman's move ment to the left had given him an open way to Ackworth, he abandoned the position and threw his army upon the moun tains and hills north and west of Marietta. The Army of the Cumberland rested on the 5th, and on the next day moved leisurely into position southwest of Ackworth : Hooker's corps, near the junction of the Sandtown road with the one leading from Burnt Hickory to Marietta ; Palmer's ou"], [97, "ETOWAH \u2014 ALLATOONA \u2014 NEW HOPE CHURCH. 83 his left, and Howard's at Durham's house, three miles from Ackworth. McPherson was now on the left and Schofield on the right. As all the troops had been under fire for several consecutive days, though there had been no general battle, a rest until the 10th was declared. During this period, the re pair of the railroad was hastened, and Allatoona was fortified as a secondary base of supplies. June 8th, General Blair reached Ackworth with nine thou sand men, having left fifteen hundred as a garrison at Alla toona. This reinforcement restored the grand aggregate of the armies again.

Henceforth great caution must be exercised to cover and protect trains. *********. By order of Major-General W. T. Sherman. L. M. DAYTON, Aid-de-Camp.

Colonel Long tele graphs from Pulaski, and should overtake you at Decatur, or soon after leaving. Although you must move on Rome and Kingston by the direct road, still you can make believe you have designs on Gadsden and Talla dega. Keep silent, and the enemy will exaggerate your strength and purposes. Johnston has called to him all the infantry of the Southwest, and also the cavalry of Mississippi, so you must look out for them. If they hang around you, keep Long close in, and watch the opportunity for him to charge with sabers. W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General Commanding.

General : \u2014 If you can 't drive the enemy from his position, work to the left, so as to connect with Hooker. We are working on the left of the line in front of us, and as soon as you are in connection with General Hooker, I will strengthen the left, and work round in that direction, so we may, if we choose, march round their extreme right, and reach Marietta or Ackworth.

Our columns met about one mile east of Pumpkin Vine creek, and we pushed them back about three miles, to the point where the road forks to Allatoona and Marietta. Here Johnston has chosen a strong line, and made hasty but strong parapets of timber and earth, and has thus far stopped us.

SHERMAN, Major-General. Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, near Dallas, May 30, 1864. General Halleck, Washington, D. C. : To move General McPherson up to the center, he has had to make a retrogade of a mile or so, owing to difficult ground. Every time he at tempted to withdraw division by division, the enemy attacked his whole line ; it may be on the theory that we wanted to draw off altogether. These assaults were made in the night, and were all repulsed with comparatively small loss to us, but seemingly heavy to the enemy. If we can induce the enemy to attack us, it is to our advantage. Do n't expect us to make much progress toward the Chattahoochee till Blair comes up, and moves into Allatoona Pass. W. T. SHERMAN, Major- General. Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, Ackworth, June 8, 1864. Major-General Halleck, Washington, D. C : General Blair arrived to-day, with two divisions of the Seventeenth Army Corps, about nine thousand (9,000) strong, having left about fifteen hundred (1,500) in the Allatoona Pass, to fortify and hold it. Colonel Wright, railroad superintendent, reports he will have the Etowah bridge done by the 12th instant. To-morrow I will feel forward with cavalry, and follow with infantry the moment the enemy develops his designs. If he fights at Kenesaw Mountain, I will turn it; but if he selects the line of the Chattahoochee, then I must study the case a little before I commit myself. W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General Commanding,"], [100, "86 CHAPTER XXIX. OPERATIONS NEAR KENESAW MOUNTAIN, INCLUDING THE BATTLE AT KULP'S HOUSE, ASSAULT OF THE MOUNTAIN, AND THE FLANK MOVEMENT. June 9t^h, General E. M. McCcok, commanding the First division of cavalry, made a reconnoissance in front, and having driven back the enemy's pickets, formed a heavy line three miles in front of General Hooker, and observed the enemy in force on Pine Mountain. General Johnston's army now rested with its left on Lost Mountain, its center at Gilgath Church, and its right extended across the railroad. On the 10th, Palmer's corps advanced southeasterly and confronted Pine Mountain, and skirmishing, gained an eminence within artillery range. Howard's corps, with Hooker's in rear, came abreast. The next day, Palmer and Howard advanced slightly, and moved by the left flank until Palmer's left touched Mc- Pherson's right at the railroad. General Johnston's position was now fully discovered. His lines extended over a series of hills from Kenesaw Mountain to Lost Mountain, with Pine Mountain fortified in front. Before him, the ground was so broken by ravines and so densely wooded as greatly to em barrass the advance of the national armies. Two days of constant rain prevented all motion; but on the 14th, active overations were resumed. The Fourteenth Corps, carrying with it the left of the Fourth, advanced a mile. The right of the Fourth still rested in proximity to Pine Mountain, with the Twentieth Corps closed compactly upon it. During the day, Lieutenant-General Polk was killed upon the mountain by a cannon shot from one of the guns of Simonson's Indiana battery. The advanced position"], [101, "OPERATIONS NEAR KENESAW MOUNTAIN. 87 being now well turned by the forward movement of the left of the national line, was abandoned the following night, and the troops withdrawn to the main line of intrenchments be tween Kenesaw and Lost Mountain. It was not known that General Johnston had a second in trenched line, and that he might not have time to construct one, General Sherman ordered an advance of his armies the next day. General Schofield was directed to threaten Lost Mountain ; General McPherson to turn Kenesaw Mountain on the left, and General Thomas to press the center with a view to its rupture. General Schofield carried a line of works in his immediate front, which had been left exposed by the aban donment of Pine Mountain. General McPherson gained a hill on his left front, and General Thomas advanced a mile and a half in the center; but as in all other cases, General Johnston had his key-points well fortified and strongly de fended. Newton's and Geary's divisions, supported by the remaining divisions of the Fourth and Twentieth Corps, car ried au intrenched skirmish line and advanced nearly to the main line. General Howard, deeming it unsafe to assault with out a reconnoissance, restrained Newton ; but Geary pene trated the abatis and maintained a conflict under the enemy's guns until dark, losing five hundred and thirty-four men. During the night, the two corps intrenched a line a short dis tance from the enemy, and in the morning cannon responded to cannon, while the usual skirmishing prevailed between the armies. It being now evident to General Johnston that an assault could be made with fair prospect of success, he aban doned six miles of good field-works and fell back to an in trenched line on the Marietta side of Mud creek. Early on the morning of the 17th, General Thomas ordered an advance of his army. The Fourth and Twentieth Corps and the right of the Fourteenth moved over the abandoned fortifications in a southeasterly direction, and encountered a skirmish line in front of a series of hills extending southwest from Kenesaw Mountain. The ground was so favorable to the enemy that it was not until night that his skirmishers were driven across Mud creek, and during the night he made two attempts to dislodge the skirmishers of the Fourth Corps"], [102, "88 OPERATIONS NEAR KENESAW MOUNTAIN. intrenched on the west side of the stream. The next morn ing Generals Wood and Newton threw forward a strong line of skirmishers, aud partially surprising the enemy, secured a portion of his main line. General Harker, of Newton's division, without waiting for orders, deployed two regiments to hold the position. Perceiving the advantage, General How ard ordered General Newton to move up his entire division in support. General Wood gained the ridge across the creek on the right and intrenched, and General Baird moved his division promptly on Geueral Newton's left. As soon as it was dark, Newton's division intrenched within less than one hundred yards of the enemy's works. The advantage gained was de cisive. General Johnston's new line was nearly perpendicular in direction to his old one, and that portion of the latter which he had lost was so related to the former that a successful as sault was practicable. This General Thomas ordered for the next day, but the enemy withdrew before morning. Early the following morning, General Thomas ordered an advance to ascertain how far Geueral Johnston had receded. The Fourth Corps, Stanley's division leading, moved forward, and driving the enemy across Nose's creek, halted on the west bank ; the Twentieth Corps crossed the creek late in the day, and formed with its left in proximity to the right of the Fourth ; and the Fourteenth advanced toward Kenesaw Mountain and rested in line in proximity to its base, touching with its right the left of the Fourth. General Johnston's po sition was now well defined. Hood's corps was covering Marietta on the northeast ; Loring's was holding Kenesaw Mountain, and Hardee's extended from the mountain to the road from Lost Mountain to Marietta. His lines were in view running along the base of the large mountain over the small one, aud thence on the hills to the southwest. The large mountain was his salient, and from it right and left he drew back his flanks to cover Marietta and his communications. The position was one of great strength, thoroughly intrenched, and covered against approach by entanglements of every type. Through three weeks of rain, General Sherman had been pressing the enemy from position to position, but it was now apparent that General Johnston must maintain his ground or"], [103, "OPERATIONS NEAR KENESAW MOUNTAIN. 89 defend Atlanta much .nearer its gates. That he might reach round his army toward his communications, General Sherman determined to move his armies by the right flank, but not at first to uncover his depot of supplies at Big Shanty, and while he put the Army of the Cumberland in motion to the right, he held the Army of the Tennessee east of the railroad, in readiness, at call, or when the noise of battle should reveal the necessity to move also to the right. On the morning of the 20th, General Wood's division and one brigade of General Stanley's moved to the right to relieve General Williams' division, that the latter might co-operate with General Schofield whose advance was resisted on the Sand town road. During the forenoon, General Stanley, with Whit taker's and Kirby's brigades, crossed Nose's creek and in trenched a line, and in the afternoon Whittaker carried a wooded hill in his front and Kirby a bald one before him. The former barricaded at once, and held his position against repeated and furious assaults of the enemy, but the latter hav ing been less prompt in constructing defenses, was driven back. At dark, the extended right of the Fourteenth Corps touched the left of the Fourth, and Williams' division was in connection with General Schofield's left. The next morning, General Newton's division was relieved by a division from General Palmer's corps, when it moved to the right of General Wood. This accomplished, Geueral Howard ordered Kirby's brigade and Nodine's, the left bri gade of General Wood's division, to regain the hill which Kirby had lost the evening previous. It had been intrenched by the enemy during the night, and his artillery bore upon it, but these brigades carried it handsomely and intrenched its crest, under the fire of two of the enemy's batteries. General Wood then pushed two regiments to the front and right, and gained an eminence which commanded a long intrenched skirmish line, and permitted the advance of the right of the Fourth Corps a distance of five hundred yards. General Hooker advanced with his left abreast of General Howard's right, against all the resistance the enemy could offer. This movement was so threatening, that General Johnston trans ferred Hood's corps from his right to his left, leaving only"], [104, "90 OPERATIONS NEAR KENESAW MOUNTAIN. Wheeler's cavalry in front of the Army of the Tennessee, and made three unsuccessful assaults during the night to dislodge General Wood. The removal of this corps from General McPherson's front was so thoroughly covered by the activity of Wheeler's troop ers, that he was led to believe that there was a concentration rather than a vacuum behind their bold front. But though General Johnston succeeded in hiding the uncovering of his right, and the heavy concentration on his left, his subsequent aggression resulted in signal defeat. He gained, however, in defensive strength at the very point it was most needed, and defeated the combination to turn his left, and in fact defeated for a time all efforts to dislodge him. General Sherman's plan proposed that General McPherson should, \" at the first pos sible chance, push forward on the line of the railroad and main Marietta road, break through the enemy and pursue him, or secure a position on the commanding ridge over which these roads pass,\" while the movement of the Army of the Cumberland toward General Schofield, who was searching for the enemy's left flank, should cause him to lengthen his line \" beyond his ability to defend,\" and give an opportunity to break it, by a quick aud energetic blow. This maneuver en tirely failed in its final development through the transfer of Hood's corps from the right to the left, so secretly that it was in battle against Hooker's corps, on the Powder Spring road, before it was ascertained that it was not still before McPher son. The movements ordered by General Sherman for the 22d,. had reference to preparation for attack upon Johnston's left flank. He directed Geueral Schofield to cross Nose's creek, and turn the head of his column up toward Marietta until he reached Hooker, and deploy south of the Marietta and Pow der Spring road ; while General Hooker was ordered to get possession of the ground, if practicable, up to Mrs. Kulp's, and deploy with his right resting on the Powder Spring road. This accomplished, the remainder of General Thomas' line was to be advanced in conformity. General McPherson was instructed to press the enemy in his front, to cover Bio-"], [105, "OPERATIONS NEAR KENESAW MOUNTAIN. 91 Shanty, and hold his rear massed in readiness to support General Thomas, should he become heavily engaged. At 3 a. m. on the 22d, Cobham's detachment of Geary's di vision drove the enemy from the hill a mile in front of the center of the Twentieth Corps. The whole division soon fol lowed, and intrenched a commanding ridge, reversing the works of the enemy, and covering artillery as well as infantry lines. Subsequently, Williams' division advanced to Geary's right, and Butterfield's to his left, each skirmishing into posi tion. The corps did not form a continuous line, but each division occupied a hill with slopes to right and left, and between Williams' left and Geary's right there was a swampy ravine. Williams' right rested on the Powder Spring road, at Kulp's house, and his division was formed with Ruger's brigade on the right, Knipe's in the center, and Robinson's on the left. In front of Robinson, who held a lateral hill, slightly refused, there was an open space extending to Geary's front. The ground was open before Knipe, except in front of his left, and almost entirely wooded in Ruger's front. Geu eral Williams' placed Winegar's and Woodbury's batteries before his center and left so as to command all the open ground. When the Twentieth Corps had attained this ad vanced position, General Howard moved his line forward in correspondence. At 3 p. m., General Williams was informed that Hood's corps was massed before him. Reporting the fact to General Hooker, he was directed to deploy his division and construct breast works without delay. He had, however, no time to construct defenses, and barely enough for array, before the enemy was seen to emerge from the woods beyond the open space in his front and dash toward his lines. The formation in triple lines and the peculiar shout of the troops forming them, alike,pre saged an assault. The movement was begun with the enemy's usual spirit, but Woodbury's canister swept the open ground with such destructive effect that 'the enemy was soon thrown into confusion and retreat. A portion of the column was driven directly back, and the remainder was forced by volleys from Knipe's line and Ruger's left, to seek cover in a ravine and dense clump of trees and underbrush, on Knipe's lest front."], [106, "92 OPERATIONS NEAR KENESAW MOUNTAIN. A second column moved directly against Robinson's position, but being exposed in the open ground to a direct fire from Winegar's battery, and an enfilading one from Geary's guns on the left, was also thrown into confusion and rout. As a final effort, the rebel troops who had taken shelter in the ravine and woods, having been reinforced from the rear, attempted to turn Knipe's left flank by a stealthy advance under cover ; but the movement having been perceived, Winegar's battery and Geary's artillery again opened. The Sixty -first Ohio of Robin son's brigade advanced to support the endangered flank, and the concentric fire of artillery and musketry soon completed the repulse of the enemy. While Hood's attack was in pro gress, heavy cannonading was maintained throughout the front of the Army of the Cumberland. In the repulse of Hood's attack, General Hooker's artillery was so remarkably effective, that General Johnston admitted in his official report that his troops, Stevenson's and Hindman's divisions, were compelled to withdraw by the fire of fortified artillery. His loss was exceedingly heavy ; General Hooker's very light. General Williams, who alone was directly assailed, lost only one hundred and thirty men, including nineteen cap tured on the picket line by the sudden advance of the enemy. Major D. C. Becket, of the Sixty-first Ohio, was killed. As soon as the character of the attack upon General Hooker was developed, General Thomas made provision for his support. The reserve regiments of the Fourth Corps were immediately thrown to the right, and as soon as practicable, Butterfield's division was relieved by Stanley's, and moved to the rear of Williams' right. These dispositions were sufficient for defense, but the transfer of Hood's corps to General Johnston's left flank, necessitated a new combination, either to turn his posi tion or break through his lines. General Thomas suggested that General McPherson should attack Marietta from the east side of Kenesaw Mountain ; but General Sherman decided to attack General Johnston's fortified lines near his center, and on the 24th, directed Generals McPherson and Thomas to make preparations to assault on the 27th \u2014 the former near Little Kenesaw, and the latter about a mile to the south, in front of the Fourth Corps."], [107, "OPERATIONS NEAR KENESAW MOUNTAIN. 93 General Thomas designated Davis' and Newton's divisions to form the assaulting column, and during the night of the 25th, Davis' and Baird's divisions having been relieved on the left of the Army of the Cumberland by General McPherson's troops, moved to the rear of the Fourth Corps. On the morn ing of the 27th, Morgan's brigade of Davis' division occupied the intrenchments thrown up by Whittaker's brigade of Stan ley's division. Stanley moved to the left to support Newton, and Baird held his division in direct support on Davis' right. Hooker's whole corps was held in readiness to support Palmer's and Howard's. At 8 a. m. the preparations were complete. The brigades of Colonels Daniel McCook and J. G. Mitchell were massed in rear of the intrenchments held by Morgan's brigade, as there was no cover for formation in front. Their point of attack was a salient in the enemy's works, conforming to a projection in the ridge, around whose summit his fortifications were built, and was selected in consequence of the absence of obstructions in front. Newton's division was formed with Barker's and Wagner's brigades in line, slightly separated for better cover, and KimbalPs in echelon with Wagner's. For fifteen minutes all the artillery available, poured a concentrated fire upon the points of attack, and then the columns moved forward. From the moment that McCook's and Mitchell's brigades bounded over their intrenchments, they were subjected to a galling fire of artillery and musketry. The distance to the enemy's works was about six hundred yards, and the ground wTas rough and partially covered with trees and undergrowth ; but disregard ing the fire of the enemy and the difficulties of the way, these brigades advanced rapidly until they were under the guns of the enemy. They reached his works, but such was their strength, and the spirit of the heavy forces behind them, and such their own exhaustion, that they were compelled to halt. At this juncture, their situation was exceedingly critical. To carry the works was impracticable ; to retreat, threatened almost total destruction, and the maintenance of position likewise involved great hazard and loss. As, how ever, it was soon ascertained that it was possible to so far restrain the fire of the enemy by a vigorous response that defenses could be constructed, General Thomas directed"], [108, "94 OPERATIONS NEAR KENESAW MOUNTAIN. General Davis to hold the position and fortify it. Intrenching tools were at once sent forward, and works were thrown up within a few yards of the enemy. The loss in the advance and during the day was very great. Colonel McCook fell early mor tally w-ounded ; Colonel Harmon, the next in rank, was soon after killed, when the command fell to Colonel Dilworth. Lieutenant-Colonel James Shane and Major John Yager of Mitchell's brigade received fatal wounds, and from both bri gades a very large number of officers and men were killed and wounded. The conditions of Newton's assault were somewhat differ ent, and so was the result. His troops were less exposed in the advance, but the formidable obstructions and entangle ments held them to a terrific fire under circumstances that for bade its restraint. As a consequence, he was compelled to withdraw his division altogether as soon as it was evident that the assault could not be successful. At the moment of making a second effort tp advance, General Hai'ker was mortally wounded, and in his brigade and in Wagner's the loss was very great. Some were killed on the enemy's para pet. The aggregate loss to Davis and Newton, in nearly equal division, was fifteen hundred and eighty killed, wounded, and missing. The compensation was the lodgment of troops in proximity to works too strong to be assaulted, and the in fliction of a loss to the enemy of two hundred and thirty-six men, including one hundred captured. The officers and men engaged in this assault \" went to their work with the greatest coolness and gallantry,\" as General Thomas testified, but their valor and sacrifice brought no adequate reward. During the progress of the action in the center, Generals McPherson and Schofield demonstrated strongly on the ene my's flanks. The former threw a portion of his army against a spur of Little Kenesaw, and though he attained position near the enemy, did not disturb his line. The latter gained some advantage at Olley's creek, as opening the way for an other flank movement to the right. Thus far in the campaign, Generals Sherman and Johnston had each kept up the most persistent belligerence to keep the"], [109, "OPERATIONS NEAR KENESAW MOUNTAIN. 95 other from detaching troops to Virginia. But on the 28th, General Grant authorized General Sherman to make his move ments without reference to the retention of General Johnston's forces where they were. This independence and the necessity of active offense induced immediate preparation for an effort to reach General Johnston's communications. As the ac complishment of this project necessitated the temporary abandonment of the railroad, General Sherman proposed, should the development of his movement cause General John ston to abandon Marietta, to swing in upon the road in his rear, but should he hold that position, to strike it between him and the Chattahoochee bridge. The Army of the Cumberland lost during the month five thousand seven hundred and forty-seven men \u2014 sixty-seven offi cers killed, two hundred and fifty-nine wounded, and eight missing, and eight hundred and seventy-three enlisted men killed, four thousand three hundred wounded, and forty miss ing. The army captured seven hundred and forty-two prisoners, including thirty-seven officers, and received five hundred and two deserters at Nashville and Chattanooga. During the month, the enemy's cavalry in small parties, assisted by guerrillas and disloyal citizens, was exceedingly active along the railroad south of Dalton, but wrought no damage beyond slight interruptions and the destruction of a few cars. On the 10th, the \"District of the Etowah\" was created, with General Steedman in command, who was charged with the protection of the line of supply south from Chatta nooga. Soon after, the district commander sent Colonel Wat kins' brigade of cavalry to Lafayette, and a few days later it was attacked by General Pillow with about two thousand men. Colonel Watkins refused to surrender, and with four hundred men defended the town until reinforced by Colonel Croxton, commanding the Fourth Kentucky Mounted In fantry, whose vigorous attack routed the enemy. Pillow's loss was about three hundred men, including eighty captured. Watkins and Croxton lost sixty. On the 28th, Brigadier- General Smith's division of the Fifteenth Corps arrived at Chattanooga, and was soon after disposed to protect the rail road north from Allatoona."], [110, "96 OPERATIONS NEAR KENESAW MOUNTAIN. As these troops gave assurance of secure communications, and as supplies had been accumulated in such quantity as to warrant the temporary abandonment of the railroad, General Sherman gave orders, July 1st, for the movement of his armies to the right, to turn the position he had failed to carry by assault. His orders required that General Thomas should hold his intrenchments and observe the enemy until General McPherson should pass to the right in menace to Johnston's rear. General McPherson moved his army on the 2d, and the night following General Johnston withdrew his army, and when morning dawned, was far on his way to other intrench ments. In the pursuit, the Army of the Cumberland first converged upon Marietta, and then moved on the direct roads to Atlanta. The enemy's rear-guard was overtaken four miles from Marietta, and driven forward to Ruff's station, where his forces were found in strong earthworks, constructed long before in provision for retreat. The lines of the Army of the Cumberland were speedily formed, and at midnight were again in closest proximity to the enemy. General Sher man urged his army commanders to extreme activity and vigor to press the enemy in confusion upon the bridges across the Chattahoochee. But General Johnston was secure against direct attack. His forecast of the possibilities of the unequal war fare had been so exhaustive that his steps from one intrenched position to another had all been anticipated. He held his works at Ruff's station and on his left flank against General McPherson, until Hood's and Loring's corps were across the Chattahoochee, and then placed Hardee's corps in his intrench ments on the right bank of the river to cover the bridges. General Sherman's plans were soon formed, though their execution was deferred to give rest to his armies, perfect his communications, and accumulate supplies in proximate depots, that he might be free from daily dependence upon the contin uity of his communications in the next stage of his cam paign. He proposed to make the next advance from his left, and the initial dispositions were such as at the same time to protect his communications against an anticipated cavalry raid north of Marietta. While holding the main portion of the Army of the Cumberland firmly against Hardee's corps in his"], [111, "OPERATIONS NEAR KENESAW MOUNTAIN. 97 defenses, and feigning with the Army of the Tennessee and Stoneman's cavalry far down to the right, he threw Garrard's cavalry to Roswell, and disposed the Army of the Ohio, and portions of the Fourth Corps, to secure and fortify the cross ings from Roswell to Paice's ferry. Between the 6th and 9thr two heads of column crossed the river, one at Roswell and the other at Phillips' ferry; and to give security to the cross ings, strong defenses were thrown up on the enemy's side of the river.

General Halleck, Washington, D. C. : Johnston is intrenched on the hills embracing Lost Mountain, Pine Hill, and Kenesaw. Our lines are down to him, but it has rained so hard, and the ground is so boggy, that we have not developed any weak point or flank. I will proceed with due caution, and try and make no mistake. The Etowah bridge is done, and the construction train has been to our very camps. Supplies will now be accumulated at Allatoona Pass, or brought right up to our lines. One of my chief objects being to give full employment to Joe John ston, it makes no difference where he is, so he is not on his way to Vir ginia. W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General. Headquarters Military Division op the Mississippi, In the Field, Big Shanty, June 13, 1864. Major-General Halleck, Washington, D. O. : We have had hard and cold rains for about ten days. A gleam of sun shine this evening gives hope of a change. The roads are insufficient here, and the fields and new ground are simply impassable to wheels. As soon as possible I will study Johnston's position on Kenesaw and Lost Mountain, and adopt some plan to dislodge him or draw him out of his position. We can not risk the heavy losses of an assault at this distance from our base. Cars now run to our very front camps. All well. There are troops enough in Kentucky to manage Morgan, and in Ten nessee to watch Forrest should he make his appearance, as Johnston doubtless calculates. W. T. SHERMAN, Major- General. Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, Big Shanty, June 16, 1864. General Halleck, Washington, D. C. : General Thomas did not make the progress last night I expected. He found the enemy strongly intrenched on a line slightly advanced from a straight line connecting Lost and Kenesaw Mountain. I have been along it to-day, and am pressing up close. Shall study it, and am now inclined to feign on both flanks, and assault the center. It may cost us dear, but in result would surpass an attempt to pass round. The enemy has a strong position, and covers his road well, and the only weak point in the game is in having the Chattahoochee in his rear. If, by assaulting, I can break his line, I see no reason why it should not pro duce a decisive effect. I know he shifts his troops about to meet our"], [113, "99 OPERATIONS NEAR KENESAW MOUNTAIN. supposed attacks, and thereby fatigues his men, and the woods will enable me to mask our movements. W. T.

The roads are impassable, and fields and woods be come quagmires after a few wagons have crossed, yet we are at work all the time. The left flank is across Novaday, and the right across Nose's creek. The enemy holds Kenesaw, a conical mountain, with Marietta behind it, and has retired his flanks to cover that town and his rail road. I am all ready to attack the moment the weather and roads will permit troops and artillery to move with anything like life. W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General Commanding. Headqtarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, June 22, 1864. General: \u2014 I will start early to look at the position of McPherson as near the north base of Kenesaw as I can safely do, and then come to Wallace's, or the house in front, and then over to Hooker. I have ordered Schofield to cross his whole command over Nose's creek, and turn the head of his column up toward Marietta, until he reaches Hooker, to sup port and co-operate on his right, but to keep his cavalry and a part of his rear infantry on the Sandtown road, prepared to regain it in case the enemy shows signs of let go. I fear we will get our commands too close, but I suppose Schofield can find room to deploy south of the Powder Springs and Marietta road. You may order Hooker to extend to that road and leave Schofield beyond. If he can get possession of the ground up to Mrs. Kulp's house, I wish him to do so, and the balance of your line to conform. I will explain McPherson's orders when I meet you. W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General Commanding. Major-General Thomas, Commanding Army of the Cumberland.

Sherman, \"Major-General.\""], [114, "100 OPERATIONS NEAR KENESAW MOUNTAIN. At this hour (9 1) I have received this answer: \" Kulp House \u2014 5.30 p. m. \" We have repulsed two heavy attacks, and feel confident, our only ap prehension being from our extreme right flank. Three (3) entire corps are in front of us. \" Major-General Hooker.\" I was at the Wallace house at 5.30 p. m., and the Kulp house was within two miles ; and though I heard some cannonading, I had no idea of his being attacked, and General Hooker must be mistaken about three (3) corps being in his front. Johnston's army has only three corps, and I know there was a respectable force along McPherson's front ; so much so, that this general thought the enemy was massing against him. I know there was some force in front of Palmer and Howard, for I was there. Still, it is very natural the enemy should meet Hooker at that point in force, and I gave Schofield orders this morning to conduct his column from Nose's creek, on the Powder Spring road, toward Marietta, and support Hooker's right flank, sending his cavalry down the Powder Spring road toward Sweet water, and leaving some infantry from his rear to guard the fords. Cap tain Dayton says that General Schofield received my orders, which were in writing. If later information shows that Schofield is not up, send a staff officer and notify him of the necessity, and, if need be, call off all of Palmer's, and notify McPherson, who has orders for this very contin gency. To-morrow, if need be, we must bring things to a crisis. Cars and telegraph now all right. Some of John E. Smith's men are at Chattanooga, so that I think our road will be better guarded The cavalry of Lowe should be out on the Tennessee road, patrolling from Cartersville to Spring Place. W. T.

General: \u2014 General Hooker, this p. m., advanced to the Kulp house, two and half miles southwest of Marietta, and reports finding three (3) corps. He was attacked twice, and successfully repulsed the enemy. General Thomas thinks that that will be the enemy's tactics, and that you ought to attack Marietta from that side of Kenesaw, but I judge the safer and better plan to be the one I indicated, viz., for you to leave a light force and cover that flank, and throw the remainder rapidly, and as much out of view as possible, to our right. You may make the necessary orders, and be prepared for rapid action to-morrow. So dispose matters that the big guns of Kenesaw will do you as little mischief as possible. Yours, etc., W. T.

General Wagner's brigade of Newton's division, supporting General Harker, was so severely handled that it is compelled to reorganize. Colonel Mitchell's brigade of Davis' division captured one line of rebel breastworks, which they still hold. McCook's brigade was also severely handled, nearly every colonel being killed or wounded. It is compelled to fall back and reorganize. The troops are all too much exhausted to advance, but we hold all that we have gained. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Headquarters Department op the Cumberland, June 27.. General Sherman : Your dispatch of 2.25 received. We still hold all the ground we have gained, and the division commanders report their ability to hold. They also report the enemy's works exceedingly strong; in fact, so strong that they can not be carried by assault, except by immense sacrifice, even if they can be carried at all. I think, therefore, the best chance is to ap proach them by regular saps, if we can find a favorable approach to bat ter them down.

There are no supplies of any kind here. I can press Johnston, and keep him from reinforcing Lee, but to assault him in position will cost us more lives than we can spare. McPherson took, to-day, one hundred prisoners, and Thomas about as many, but I do not suppose that we have inflicted heavy loss on the enemy, as he kept close behind his parapets. W. T.

Had we broken the line to day, it would have been most decisive; but as it is, our loss is small com pared with some of those east. It should not in the least discourage us. At times, assaults are necessary and inevitable. At Arkansas Post we succeeded ; at Vicksburg we failed.

At the same time, General Stoneman's cavalry, supported by McCook, should move across Sweetwater by Powder Springs, and down the west side of Sweet water creek to Sweetwater town, which crossing once secured, Stoneman to hold it, and McCook to return to Lost Mountain.

W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General Commanding. [SPECIAL FIELD ORDERS, NO 31.] Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, near Kenesaw Mountain, July 1, 1864. The object of the contemplated movement is to deprive the enemy of the great advantage he has in Kenesaw, as a watch-tower from which to observe our every movement, to force him to come out of his intrench ments, or move further south. To attain this end : I. All army commanders will fill up their wagons at Big Shanty depot, to their utmost, with provisions, ammunition, and forage. The chief quartermaster and commissary will give all necessary orders to clean out the depots in front of Allatoona, and so instruct that the locomotives and cars will come forward of Allatoona with great caution, and only when or dered by chief commmissary. II. Major-General Thomas will hold the ground below Kenesaw, as far as Olley's cre\"ek, near Mount Zion ; Major-General Schofield that from Olley's creek to Nickajack, and General McPherson will move his train and troops rapidly in a single march, and as little observed from Kenesaw as possible, to the Sandtown road, and down it to the extreme right, with one corps near the Widow Mitchell's, another near Ruff's mill on the Nickajack, and the the third in reserve, near the forks of the road. III. General Garrard's cavalry will cover the roads out of Marietta which pass north of Kenesaw, and General Stoneman's cavalry will oc cupy Sweetwater (old town), coincident with the movement of McPherson. General McCook will receive orders from General Thomas. In case the enemy presses Garrard back by superior and overwhelming forces, he will send one of his brigades to the flank of General Thomas, and will, with the others, fall back gradually toward Allatoona, disputing every foot of ground. IV. Major-General McPherson will threaten the Chattahoochee river and also the railroad, and General Thomas will press the enemy close, and, at the very earliest possible moment, break his lines, and reach the railroad below Marietta. All movements must be vigorous and rapid, as the time allowed is limited by the supplies in our wagons. By order of Major-General W. T. Sherman. L. M.

Whether the enemy will halt this side of the Chattahoochee or not will soon be known. Marietta is almost entirely abandoned by its inhabitants, and more than a mile of the railroad iron is removed betwen the town and the foot of Kenesaw.

SHERMAN, Major-General Commanding, Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, near Chattahoochee, July 9, 1864. General Halleck, Washington, D. C : I telegraphed to you, and Mr. Secretary Stanton answers. Drop me a word now and then of advice and encouragement. I think I have done well to maintain such an army in this country, fighting for sixty (60) days, and yet my losses are made up by the natural increase. The assault I made was no mistake. I had to do it. The enemy, and our own army and officers, had settled down into the conviction that the assault of lines formed no part of my game, and the moment the enemy was found be hind anything like a parapet, why everybody would deploy, throw up counter-works, and take it easy, leaving it to to the \" Old Man \" to turn the position. Had the assault been made with one-fourth more vigor (mathematically), I would have put the head of George Thomas' whole army right through Johnston's deployed line on the best ground for \" go ahead,\" while my entire forces were well in hand on roads converging to my then object, Marietta. Had Harker and McCook not been struck down so early, the assault would have succeeded, and then the battle would have all been in our favor, on account of our superiority of num bers and initiative. Even as it was, Johnston has been much more cau tious since, and gave ground more freely. His next fighting line (Smyrna camp-ground) he only held one day. Write me a note occasionally, and suggest anything that may occur to you, as I am really in the wilderness down here; but I will fight any and all the time on anything like fair terms, and that is the best strategy, but it would not be fair to run up against such parapets as I find here. W. T. SHERMAN, Major- General."], [122, "108 OPERATIONS NEAR KENESAW MOUNTAIN. Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, near Chattahoochee River, July 13, 1864. Dear General : \u2014 I have written you but once since the opening of the campaign, but I report by telegraph to General Halleck daily, and he furnishes you copy. My progress was slower than I calculated, from two chief causes \u2014 an uninterrupted rain from June 2d to the 2'Jd, and the peculiar submountainous nature of the country from the Etowah to the Chattahoochee. But we have overcome all opposition, and whipped Johnston in every fight when we were on anything like fair terms, and I think the army feels that way, that we can whip the enemy in anything like a fair fight ; but he has uniformly taken shelter behind parallels of strong profile, made in advance for him by negroes and militia. I regarded an assault on the 27th of June necessary for two good reasons : 1. Because the enemy, as well as my own army, had settled down into the belief that \" flanking\" alone was my game ; and, 2. That on that day and ground, had the assault succeeded, 1 could have broken Johnston's center, and pushed his army back in confusion, and with great loss, to his bridges over the Chattahoochee. We lost nothing in morale in the assault, for I followed it up on the extreme right, and compelled him to quit the very strong lines of Kenesaw, Smyrna camp-ground, and the Chattahoochee, in quick suc cession I have now fulfilled the first part of the \" grand plan.\" Our lines are up to the Chattahoochee, and the enemy is beyond. I feel certain we have killed and crippled for Joe Johnston as many as we have sent of our men to the rear ; have sent back about six or seven thousand prisoners ; have taken eleven (11) guns of Johnston, and about ten (10) in Rome; have destroyed immense iron, cotton, and wool mills; and have possession of all the entire country. My operations have been rather cautious than bold, but, on the whole, I trust are satisfactory to you. W. T. SHERMAN, r. Major-General Commanding.

Acting upon the belief that two corps were across the river, and intrenched, General Johnston withdrew Hardee's corps the night of the 9th, and the smoke of the burning bridges was the first revelation of his action. He selected as his next line, Peachtree creek and the Chattahoochee below its mouth, and placed his army on the high ground south of the creek in \"waiting to attack the national armies whenever they should attempt to cross. Should he be unsuccessful in preventing their passage, he proposed to delay their approach to Atlanta until his defenses between the Marietta and Decatur roads could be intrusted to the state troops, and then sally out with his whole army, and strike the flank most exposed. He was under the impression that his method of defense, covering con tinually, not only his main line, but his skirmishers, with in trenchments, had enabled him to inflict losses fivefold greater than his own, and that such had been the reduction of Gen eral Sherman's superiority that he could now safely deliver offensive battle, especially as he had the fortifications of At lanta for refuge in the event of defeat, which, in his esti mation, were \" too strong to be assaulted, and too extensive to be invested.\" But as his estimation of the reduction of Gen eral Sherman's strength was radically erroneous, there was no ground for his faith in his ability to meet him in general battle. He confessed a loss of ten thousand killed and wounded of infantry and artillery, and though General Sher man's loss in the same arms were probably one-half more, the relative strength of the armies had not materially changed since the battle of Resaca, and now, as then, he had fifty"], [124, "110 ADVANCE UPON ATLANTA, ETC. thousand against a hundred thousand men for an open battle. In the defense of fortifications, he was relatively stronger, as he had gradually received accessions of militia, to be used only in constructing and holding intrenchments, so that his pur pose to act offensively before Atlanta was formed in ignorance of the fact that General Sherman had maintained a hundred thousand men on his offensive front, against all his losses and the demands of an ever-lengthening line of supply. To General Sherman, the outlook from the Chattahoochee was promising in the main, but there were contingencies pro ductive of no slight anxiety. He had been able thus far to maintain his communications against all the forces that Gen eral Johnston could detach against them ; but Forrest, the bold raider, had given remote menace from East Tennessee, and the possibility of a dash by him from Mississippi was not yet entirely removed. And he looked anxiously, though hope fully, to Major-General Canby, commanding the newly created military division of \"West Mississippi, to so engage the enemy's forces in the West and Southwest as to prevent their approach to his rear. Before him, the city of Atlanta, his next objective, was in view. Its importance as a railroad and manufacturing center, and the moral effect of its successful defense, might justly be regarded as overmastering incentives to the enemy to fortify, and to fight to hold it. To sever its railroad con nection with the states west, and cut off supply and reinforce ment from that quarter, General Rousseau, with a mounted force, was in motion from Decatur, Alabama, to Opelika, and Stoneman had been sent to strike the same road nearer At lanta. But another general advance could not be delayed in waiting for the issues of remote operations, and with the com pletion of preparations for it, there came, as an incentive to prompt motion, the announcement from General Grant that the transfer of Confederate troops from Virginia to Georgia was not improbable, and that provision for such a contingency should be made. On the 16th, the date of General Grant's dispatch, General Sherman gave orders for the advance toward Atlanta on the following day. McPherson's army had been previously trans ferred from the extreme right to Roswell ; Schofield's was across"], [125, "ADVANCE UPON ATLANTA, ETC. 111 in front of Phillip's ferry, and Howard's corps on the south side, before Power's ferry. The next morning, General McPherson crossed at Roswell, and moved toward the Augusta railroad, east of Decatur; General Schofield advanced toward Cross Keys, and Palmer's and Hooker's corps passed the river on pontoon bridges, at Paice's ferry, covered by Wood's di vision, which marched down the left bank of the river from Power's ferry, and subsequently rejoined the Fourth Corps, and with it moved toward Buckhead. Garrard's cavalry acted with General McPherson, and Stoneman's and McCook's watched the river and roads below the railroad. The movement was a right wheel, with Palmer's corps of the Army of the Cumberland as a pivot. The night of the 17th, the Army of the Cumberland rested on Nancy's creek, a tributary of Peachtree creek, having pressed back the enemy's skirmishers from the bank of the Chattahoochee. The next day it advanced until Palmer's right rested at the junction of Nancy's and Peachtree creeks, and Howard's corps at Buckhead. General Schofield approached Decatur, and General McPherson broke up a section of the Augusta railroad a few miles east of the town. The line was now a long one, but the movements prescribed for the 19th were de signed to unite the armies before Atlanta, or in that city. Early in the morning, Woods' division leading, the Fourth Corps reached Peachtree creek on the Buckhead and At lanta road, finding the bridge burned and a heavy fortification on the high ground beyond, manned with infantry and artil lery. In the afternoon, General Wood constructed a bridge and forced the passage, and drove the enemy from his defenses. General Stanley crossed the north fork of the creek some dis tance to the left, against strong opposition. To the right, Davis' and Geary's divisions fought their way over the stream. General Geary covered the construction of a foot-bridge with a heavy artillery fire, and gained a strong position beyond. General Davis first threw over Dilworth's brigade, which soon became warmly engaged, and after a sharp conflict repulsed the enemy. Mitchell's brigade moved promptly in support, and participated in the action near its close. All the troops on the south side intrenched during the night."], [126, "112 ADVANCE UPON ATLANTA, ETC. Early the next morning the remaining divisions of the Army of the Cumberland passed the stream. This army was now compactly formed, and was under orders to advance to de velop the enemy's purpose with respect to Atlanta. Between General Thomas' left and General Schofield's right there was, however, a wide interval, and General Sherman ordered two divisions of the Fourth Corps to move to the left to connect with General Schofield. Their movement to the left did not fill the interval nor greatly diminish its length, but changed its location in the general battle front, and gave the prepon derance of strength to the left wing. When Stanley and Wood had moved to the left and faced toward Atlanta, in harmony with General Schofield's column, there was still an interval of nearly two miles* between the right of their line and General Thomas' left on the Buckhead road. When General Williams crossed the creek, he advanced be yond General Geary to an eminence abreast of one Johnson had taken for his division on the left of the Fourteenth Corps, and separated from it by a depression. Here he halted, by direction of General Hooker, as he was near an extensive in trenched outpost of the enemy, and his front was covered by dense woods and thickets. At 10 A. M. General Geary moved forward to the hill on the left of General Williams, and formed his division several hundred yards in advance. Later, General Newton advanced and attained a good position in open ground on the Buckhead road, a division interval from Geary's left. General Hooker for a time held Ward's division opposite this interval, but concealed behind a hill. The resistance offered to the skirmishers that covered the advance of these divisions, and other circumstances, indicated the presence of the enemy in strong force, and both Newton and Geary made dispositions for defense. The former placed two brigades in line \u2014 Wag ner's, Colonel Blake commanding, on the left of the road, and Kimball's on the right \u2014 and held Bradley's in column for sup port. Between the two deployed brigades, he placed a four gun battery, and constructed slight rail barricades. General Geary formed his division with Candy's brigade on the left, * Statement in General Howard's report."], [127, "ADVANCE UPON ATLANTA, ETC. 113 Jones' on the right, and Ireland's massed in rear of Jones'. As the ground in front of Jones was wooded, but open before Candy and on his left, General Geary planted his guns on Candy's line. Here also barricades of rails were constructed. A new army commander had been observing the movements of the national forces since the 17th, as on that day General Johnston, by order of the Confederate President, had given his army and his immediate projects to General Hood. General Johnston had proposed to himself attack General Sherman's armies as they should cross Peachtree creek, in hopes of press ing them in confusion upon the creek and the river beyond, but he had not anticipated such favorable conditions as now existed. He had determined to assume the offensive against Sherman's combined armies, and to make flanks to turn, by breaking lines ; but his successor had been permitted to see the wide separation of the two smaller armies from the Army of the Cumberland, and then to see the latter cross Peachtree creek bereft of the two divisions which extended its flank be tween the forks of the stream, and then advance with its short ened left flank thrown forward almost to the hills upon which his forces were massed for sudden attack, while its right was wedged in between his works and the creek. And now to add surprise to exposure, that his success might be assured, he called in his skirmishers in semblance of entire withdrawal, and sent soldiers into the national lines, under the pretense of capture, who should say that there were no heavy bodies of their troops within two miles. So when, after formation, the most exposed divisions threw forward their skirmishers to de velop the state of things in their front, there was no resist ance, and no enemy in view until the moment that the massed forces were ready to spring from concealment, in boldest at tack. The blow was well concealed, and it was well delivered under the most favorable conditions. It was nevertheless as complete a failure as any assault of the war. At 3 p. m. the enemy in masses rushed from the woods. A division attacked Newton in front ; another passed his left flank altogether, and thrust itself between Peavine and Peach tree creeks, and a third attacked his right flank. As the vol. n \u2014 8"], [128, "114 ADVANCE UPON ATLANTA, ETC. menace to his left flank involved the greatest danger, General Newton first repulsed the column on his left, and drove it to the woods, with Bradley's brigade and his reserve artillery. Wagner's and Blake's brigades next repelled the front attack, and drove back the enemy with heavy loss. The latter changed front at right angles, and engaged the enemy's third division. While this division had advanced between Newton and Geary, in evident belief that then there was a complete opening in the line, and had faced to the east to engage New ton, Ward's division advanced from cover, and the heavy skirmish line, far in advance, composed of the Twenty-second Wisconsin and One Hundred and Thirty-sixth New York, Lieutenant-Colonel Bloodgood commanding, held the enemy in check until the whole division had reached a hill to the right and rear of Newton. The unexpected appearance of this division and its destructive fire threw the enemy into confusion, and he fell back with shattered ranks. General Ward then advanced to another eminence abreast of Newton and Geary, and formed his division so as to connect with the right of the one and the left of the other. The hill he occu pied commanded the open space for six hundred yards in front, and the enemy for a time refrained from attack. During this interval, General Ward fortified his position. The enemy first attacked the right of Geary's line, then passed round to attack him in flank and rear. Williams' division not being fully abreast, this advantage was possible. Geary was therefore compelled to change front to the right with almost all of his di vision, and extend his line to connect with Williams, leaving only five regiments, with his artillery, on his first line. When the noise of severe battle was first heard by General Williams, he was in the act of moving artillery to his skirmish line, to dislodge the enemy from his fortified outpost; but warned by the heavy volleys of musketry on his left, he deployed his division at double-quick \u2014 Knipe's brigade on the right, Robin son's on the left, and Ruger's in reserve \u2014 to await the devel opment of the attack. He placed his batteries by sections, to command his front and flanks, and held three sections in re serve. Hardly had these dispositions been made before the enemy advanced upon Williams in great force, and having"], [129, "ADVANCE UPON ATLANTA, ETC. 115 \u25a0driven in his skirmishers, with his line of battle under cover of the thickets and undergrowth, approached very near with out being seen. His attack, as in other cases, was direct in part, but heavy masses swept down the ravines to right and left. Hearing heavy firing on his right, General Williams sent the Twenty-seventh Indiana to reinforce Knipe's right. This regiment and the Forty-sixth Pennsylvania speedily checked and drove back the enemy, and held the ground until the -close of the action. On the left, the attack was more threat ening, because made with stronger columns ; but Robinson's brigade, the artillery, and Geary's line upon the other hill, poured a destructive fire upon the enemy, and here, too, he was completely repulsed. This first attack swept from New ton's position to Colonel Anson McCook's brigade of John son's division of the Fourteenth Corps ; but though signally repulsed, General Hood did not desist, and soon again, from Newton to Johnson, the battle raged furiously. The second general action was commenced upon Newton's left in effort to double up the line by taking it in reverse as well as in flank. This time General Thomas sent the artillery of Ward's division, and in person urged the artillery horses to the greatest possible speed to meet the emergency, and then directed their action. These guns, and all of Newton's, with all kinds of metal most destructive at short range, opened upon the heavy assaulting columns, and they were again repulsed. Again the battle raged to the right; but as the national line was now compact, the enemy exhausted himself in direct attacks. His infantry assaults, as at first, extended from Newton to Johnson, and further to the right his forti fied artillery was most active, but charge after charge from left to right was repulsed, until at 6 p. M., when he abandoned his effort to turn or break the line. In this action, artillery was used with fearful effect, and so skillfully was it posted, and so bravely defended, that the enemy did not reach a single gun. When it is considered that four divisions and one brigade, in open field, repulsed an attack of the army which was in tended to initiate such offense as should destroy Sherman's armies, the grandeur of this victory becomes apparent. Not General Hood alone, but General Johnston also, was defeated"], [130, "116 ADVANCE UPON ATLANTA, ETC. in the \" Battle of Peachtree Creek.\" A new policy demanded by the authorities at Richmond, and by the Southern people, and a plan of battle elaborated by an able general and put upon trial under conditions far more favorable than had been anticipated, was defeated by less than half of the infantry and artillery of the \" Army of the Cumberland.\" Four divisions, and a third of another, parried a blow intended to initiate the ruin of three armies, comprising more than five times as many men, and the significance of the miscarriage should have been accepted as the prophecy of the doom of the rebellion. The uational troops fought great odds, introducing aggression as the policy of a new commander, to stop the further advance of General Sherman and save Atlanta. It was seemingly a grand opportunity, but the issue was positive defeat and im mense loss. An opportunity for the enemy, it was an emergency for the exposed flank and the fraction of the na tional army subjected to attack. But there were those in chief and subordinate command, who, by personal direction and vigor, inspirited the troops made veteran by participation in numerous battles. Generals Thomas and Hooker were with their troops at the points of extreme danger, and officers and men in proportionate service contributed to the emphatic repulse of the enemy in a combination planned for grandest effect. General Hood lost from three to five thousand men. He left over six hundred dead on the field, and several hundred of his men were captured. Ward's division captured seven battle flags and two hundred and forty-six prisoners. The total loss of the Army of the Cumberland was sixteen hundred. Colonel Cobham, One Hundred and Eleventh Pennsylvania ; Colonel Logie, One Hundred and Forty-fourth New York ; Lieutenant-Colonel Randall, One Hundred and Forty-ninth New York, and many other officers were killed ; and Lieutenant-Colonel W. H. H. Brown, Sixty-first Ohio, and Major Lathrop Baldwin, One Hundred and Seventh New York, were mortally wounded. A number of field and line officers were severely wounded. General Newton's loss was only one hundred, though his division was on the flank and in extreme exposure."], [131, "ADVANCE UPON ATLANTA, ETC. 117 Generals Stanley and Wood were somewhat heavily engaged during the afternoon and evening, the enemy using artillery freely. They drove in his outposts, and came up in sight of intrenchments, with the usual skirmish line in front. Late in the evening, General Stanley captured a portion of the pickets, drove in the remainder, and worked up close to the enemy. The night following, the enemy withdrew from General Newton's left. The next morning, General Wood advanced his right a mile and a half, and during the day, the Army of the Cumberland, from left to right, advanced close to the enemy's works. Heavy skirmishing was maintained ; batteries were put in position and kept in continuous action wherever there was probability of effect, and the new front was strongly intrenched. In the night, the enemy retired to the immediate defenses' of the city ; comprising a strong line of redoubts, connected by curtains, covered by abatis and cheveau de frise. The next morning, General Thomas advanced his line and intrenched as close as practicable to the enemy's works. The Fourteenth Corps fortified a line west of the railroad, the Twentieth Corps from the railroad to the Buckhead road, and the Fourth Corps from that road to General Schofield's right \u2014 the con traction of the line now permitting the reunion of the three divisions in continuous front. General Thomas' position was strong, affording commanding points for batteries within easy range of the city, and bearing directly upon the fortifications of the enemy. Constant skirmishing and cannonading were maintained. General McCook's cavalry was thrown on Gen eral Thomas' right, along Proctor's creek, and covering the Macon and Turner's Ferry roads. On the 22d, while the Army of the Tennessee was changing position to close in upon Atlauta, General Hood put upon trial General Johnston's suggestion to sally from the fortifi cations and strike the most exposed flank. This time he gained a temporary advantage, but in the final issue was defeated with heavy loss. General McPherson was killed early in the engagement, while making dispositions to save his left flank. The same day, General Rousseau arrived at Marietta, haviug"], [132, "118 ADVANCE UPON ATLANTA, ETC. accomplished his raid through Alabama and Georgia. He suggested the expedition, and had organized and commanded it by permission of General Sherman. He destroyed over thirty miles of railroad, several trestle-bridges, many station buildings, and quantities of supplies and materials. He met and defeated General Clanton at the Coosa river, and another force at Chehaw station, and having suffered a loss of about forty men from a command of twenty -five hundred, reached the theater of war at a time when cavalry reinforcements were much needed. EXTRACTS FROM THE OFFICIAL REPORT OF GENERAL JOS. E. JOHNSTON. The character of Peachtree creek, and the numerous fords in the Chattahoochee above its mouth, prevented my attempting to defend that part of the river. The broad and muddy channel of the creek would have separated the two parts of the army. It and the river, below its mouth, were therefore taken as our line. A position on the high ground south of the creek was selected for the army, from which to attack the enemy while crossing. The engineer officers, with a large force of ne groes, were set to work to strengthen the fortifications of Atlanta, and mount on them seven heavy rifles, borrowed from General Maury. The chief engineer was instructed to devote his attention, first, to the works between Marietta and Decatur roads, to put them in such condition that they might be held by state troops, so that the army might attack the enemy in flank when he approached the town. This, in the event that we should be unsuccessful in attacking the Federal army in its passage of Peachtree creek. In transferring the command to General Hood, I explained my plans to him. First, to attack the Federal army while crossing Peachtree creek. If we were successful, great results might be hoped for, as the enemy would have both it and the river to intercept his retreat. Second, if unsuccessful, to keep back the enemy by intrenching, to give time for the assembling of the state troops promised by Governor Brown ; to garri son Atlanta with those troops, and when the Federal army approached the town, to attack it on its most exposed flank with all the Confederate troops. These troops, who had been for seventy-four days in the immediate presence of the enemy, laboring and fighting daily, enduring toil, ex posure, and danger with equal cheerfulness, more confident and high spirited than when the Federal army first presented itself near Dalton, were then inferior to none who ever served the Confederacy."], [133, "ADVANCE UPON ATLANTA, ETC. 119 . I commenced the campaign with General Bragg's army of Missionary Ridge, with one brigade added (Mercer's), and two taken away (Baldwin's and Quarles'). That opposed to us was Grant's army of Missionary Ridge, then estimated at eighty thousand by our principal officers, increased, as I have stated, by two corps, a division, and several thousand recruits \u2014 in all, at least thirty thousand men. The cavalry of that army was esti mated by Major-General Wheeler at fifteen thousand. The reinforcements which joined our army amounted to fifteen thou sand infantry and artillery, and four thousand cavalry. Our scouts reported much greater numbers joining the United States army \u2014 the garrisons and bridge-guards from Tennessee and Kentucky relieved by \"one hundred days' men,\" and the Seventeenth Corps, with two thousand cavalry. The loss of our infantry and artillery, from the 5th of May, had been about ten thousand in killed and wounded, and four thousand seven hundred from all other causes, mainly slight sickness produced by heavy cold rains, which prevailed in the latter half of June. These and the slightly wounded were beginning to rejoin their regiments. For want of reports, I am unable to give the loss or the services of the cavalry, which was less under my eye than the rest of the army. Its effective strength was increased by about two thousand during the campaign. The effective force transferred to General Hood was about forty-one thousand infantry and artillery, and ten thousand cavalry. According to the opinions of our most experienced officers, daily re ports of prisoners, and statements of Northern papers, the enemy's loss in action could not have been less than five times as great as ours. In the cases in which we had the means of estimating it, it ranged from seven to one to ninety to one, compared to ours, and averaged thirteen to one. The Federal prisoners concurred in saying that their heaviest loss was in the daily attacks made in line of battle, upon our skirmishers in their rifle-pits. Whether they succeeded in dislodging our skirmishers or not, their loss was heavy and ours almost nothing. Between Dalton and the Chattahoochee, we could have given battle only by attacking the enemy intrenched, or so near intrenchments that the only result of success to us would have been his falling back into them, while defeat would have been our ruin. In the course pursued, our troops always fighting under cover, had very trifling losses compared with those they inflicted, so that the en emy's numerical superiority was reduced daily and rapidly, and we could reasonably have expected to cope with the Federal army on equal ground by the time the Chattahoochee was passed. Defeat on this side of that river would have been its destruction. We, if beaten, had a place of refuge in Atlanta, too strong to be assaulted, and too extensive to be in vested."], [134, "120 ADVANCE UPON ATLANTA, ETC. EXTRACT FROM GENERAL SHERMAN'S COMMUNICATION TO GENERAL GRANT, OF JULY 12, 1864.

I think all will be ready in three (3) days. I will have nearly one hundred thousand (100,000) men.

Major-General Sherman : The attempted invasion of Maryland having failed to give the enemy a firm foothold north, they are now returning with possibly twenty-five thousand (25,000) troops. All the men they have here beyond a suffi ciency to hold their string of fortifications, will be an element of weak ness by eating up their supplies. It is not improbable, therefore, that you will find in the next fortnight, reinforcements on your front to the number indicated above. I advise, therefore, that if you get Atlanta, you set about destroying the railroad as far to the east and south of you as possible. Collect all stores of the country for your own use, and select a point that you can hold until help can be had. I shall make a desperate effort, to get a position here which will hold the enemy without the necessity of so many men.

SIEGE OF ATLANTA. After the 22d, the situation at Atlanta conformed in the main to the type of the campaign developed north of the Oos tanaula. The two armies presented to each other fortified fronts, each inviting the attack of the other. The stronger not being able to secure a general battle on fair terms, was restricted again to a choice between assault and flank movement. As the issue of previous assaults did not warrant the attempt to carry the defenses of Atlanta, the alternative of a movement by the flank was inevitable. The railroad on the east having been greatly damaged by General Garrard to Covington, and nearer Atlanta by the Army of the Tennessee, there remained but one railroad \u2014 that from Macon to Atlanta \u2014 which had not been greatly damaged. If this road were held by the national forces or damaged beyond use, General Hood could no longer remain in the city. General Sherman resolved to change the Army of the Tennessee from the left to the right, and to reach toward the Macon road from his right flank, and at the same time throw his cavalry in two heavy columns upon it, \u2014 five thousand under General Stoneman to pass to the east of the city to McDonough, and four thousand under General McCook to the west to Fayetteville, to meet at Lovejoy's Station and there destroy the road effectually. This accomplished, General Stoneman had permission to make effort with his own division to liberate the prisoners \u2014 two thousand at Macon, and twenty thousand at Andersonville. The object of these movements was to force the enemy to come out of Atlanta to fight or be invested, or force him to extend his lines to the south, and choose between Atlanta and East Point."], [138, "124 SIEGE OF ATLANTA. The cavalry started on the 27th. General McCook crossed the Chattahoochee at Riverton, and moved rapidly on Palmetto station, on the West Point road. Here he destroyed a section of the track two and a half miles long, and advanced to Fay etteville. There he burned a hundred bales of cotton, destroyed two railroad trains, burned a train of four hundred wagons, killed eight hundred mules, saving a large number, and cap tured two hundred and fifty prisoners. He then moved to Lovej oy's Station to meet General Stoneman. He there burned the depot and having commenced the destruction of the rail road, only desisted when there was such an accumulation of the enemy that he was forced to defend himself. Hearing noth ing of General Stoneman and being strongly opposed on the east, he turned south and west to Newnan, on the West Point road. At Newnan he encountered an infantry force that had been stopped on its way to Atlanta by the break he had made in the road at Palmetto. The pursuing cavalry and the infantry now hemmed him in completely, and he was compelled to drop his captives and fight. He cut his way out with a loss of five hundred, and reached Marietta in safety with the remainder of his command. General Stoneman went farther and fared worse. He sent Garrard's cavalry to Flat Rock, and moved through Covington, down the Ocmulgee, to East Macon. In endeavoring to return, he was hemmed in and captured with seven hundred of his command, the remainder escaping. General Garrard engaged successfully two divisions of cavalry at Flat Rock, and then re turned to Atlanta. These cavalry expeditions in the main were failures, and made no impression upon the situation at Atlanta. On the 27th, General Howard was assigned to the command of the \" Army of the Tennessee \" by order of the President, and General Stanley, by seniority of rank, to the command of the Fourth Corps. At this time the Army of the Tennessee was in motion to the right, and the next morning went into position on the right of General Thomas, with its line trending to the south. As a support to this movement, General Davis' division was ordered to make a detour to Turner's ferry on the Chattahoochee, and thence to Howard's right, to take the en emy in flank should he sally forth as on the 22d. This change"], [139, "SIEGE OF ATLANTA. 125 of the Army of the Tennessee was so threatening that General Hood threw two corps upon it \u2014 Hardee's and Lee's \u2014 with great impetuosity. Attacking again and again, they were repulsed with immense loss. To create a diversion during the progress of this action, there was heavy skirmishing on the whole front of the \" Army of the Cumberland ;\" but Davis' division, General Morgan commanding, was unable, through absence of a direct road, to reach the enemy's flank in time to participate in the action. General Morgan was not only embarrassed in not finding such roads as had been anticipated, but he was left in igno rance of the abject of his movement \u2014 his orders, which were received late in the morning, not being explicit as to his duty nor definite in description of the road which he was to pur sue, and the consequence was, that the movement so far mis carried that he did not reach his camp until very late at night. The next day he was joined by General Ward's division of the Twentieth Corps, when the two divisions advanced, and driving back the enemy, ascertained that he had strong in trenched lines in their front. Strong reconnoissances from the Fourteenth and Twentieth Corps developed the fact that General Hood's lines were still strong on his right, although he had greatly extended his left. On the 30th, the picket line of the Twentieth Corps was advanced to high ground, and captured one hundred and twenty of the enemy, including eight officers. The dash was a bold one, but the ground was permanently held. The next day General Davis made a reconnoissance toward the Macon railroad, and found the enemy within a mile, posted in earth works, from which his artillery opened with canister. It was the old story of extension and counter-extension of lines and intrenchments, and the weaker army having inner lines could keep fully abreast, and at the same time have easy con centration for sally or defense. During the month the Army of the Cumberland lost forty commissioned officers, one hundred and sixty wounded, and seventeen missing ; five hundred and forty-seven enlisted men killed, two thousand five hundred and ninety-two wounded, and three hundred and forty -four missing \u2014 total, three thou-"], [140, "126 SIEGE OF ATLANTA. sand seven hundred and nine. General Hooker was relieved of the command of the Twentieth Corps, at his own request, and General Williams was assigned to temporary command. The President gave General Stanley the permanent command of the Fourth Corps. On the first of August, General Schofield moved from the left to relieve Davis and Ward, and the \"Army of the Cum berland\" was holding the left of the investing line. The Fourth Corps refused its left to cover the Buckhead road ; two divisions of the Twentieth were in the center and two divis ions of the Fourteenth between the railroad and Turner's Ferry road ; Garrard's division was on the left of the Fourth Corps, guarding the approaches from Decatur, and Roswell's and Rilpatrick's divisions, having been relieved on the line of the Etowah by McCook's, was on the railroad from Chatta hoochee bridge to Marietta. When Davis and Ward gave room for Schofield on Howard's right, and then moved to the right of Schofield, the former was on the left in line, and the latter refused, to form a strong flank. After the failure of General Hood's third effort at aggres sion, he relapsed into the defensive, and General Sherman was again forced to choose between assault and the \" turning move ment.\" The investing line had been moved far to the west and south, and yet Hood's left flank had not been found. The supposition was that the main portion of his army was on his left, extending his intrenchments as far or farther than General Sherman's, and that his main works on the north of Atlanta were held by state troops or a slender line of regular troops. General Sherman's armies had been on a strain for three months, in frequent battles, and perpetual skirmishing and watching. But though the enemy had been roughly handled during July, his army was yet as much out of reach as at any period of the campaign. General Sherman decided to again extend his line still farther to the right, so as at least to reach the Macon railroad with artillery at short range, and force General Hood to fight or abandon the city. In the execution of this plan it was necessary that his right flank should be kept exceedingly strong, while his line throughout its length should have such firmness as would insure its safety and at the same"], [141, "SIEGE OF ATLANTA. 127 time menace Atlanta from the north so strongly as to prevent an overwhelming concentration against the advancing right flank. On the 3d, Johnson's and Baird's divisions of Palmer's corps were moved to the right in support of Schofield, while Ward's division moved to the right of the Fourth Corps, and assisted in covering the space previously held by the Four teenth. The Fourth and the Twentieth now held a line of intrenchments five miles long. During the day, while General Schofield was rushing to reach the railroad, there was great activity along the whole line from General Thomas' left to General Howard's right, in skirmishing and cannonading, to relieve the pressure upon the right flank in its aggression. General Schofield succeeded in getting two divisions, one of his own, and General Baird's, across the head of TJtoy creek. General Baird formed his division on the right of General Hascall's, with his right swung back toward the creek. The next morning, General Baird readjusted his line in expectation of supporting the divisions of General Schofield in an assault. But no movement was made of a general char acter, and late in the day General Palmer directed him to feel the enemy's works in his front with a brigade. He designated Colonel Gleason's brigade for this service, which advanced in double lines with skirmishers in front. Colonel Gleason car ried the first and second line of rifle-pits, and approached so near the enemy's main line, as to develop its location and character, and drew from it an artillery and musketry fire. At night he withdrew his brigade, but held with shirmishers the outer line of rifle-pits which he had carried. The next morning at 8 A. M. General Baird's division was in line ready to advance. He was instructed to pay no atten tion to his connections on his left, as General Cox's division was to fill the space between him and General Hascall, and was informed that the latter was already so near the enemy that he would not advance during the day. He was promised support on his right by the other two divisions of his own corps, although he was not yet in communication with them. Regarding his orders to advance as imperative, he threw for ward skirmishers in double the usual strength, and moved for-"], [142, "128 SIEGE OF ATLANTA. ward in perilous insulation. As he advanced, he found that the enemy had reoccupied the inner line of rifle-pits which Colonel Gleason had carried the evening previous. This line he again carried against stubborn resistance, capturing one hundred and forty prisoners. He was then within short musket range of the enemy's main works. He could advance no farther, unless he assaulted without support, but held the position, refusing two regiments on his right, and intrenched himself as rapidly as possible under the fire of musketry and artillery. The main lines were now four hundred yards apart, while only thirty yards separated the skirmishers. Baird lost in this engagement, five officers, and seventy-eight enlisted men killed and wounded. Lieutenant-Colonel Myron Baker, commanding Ninety-fourth Indiana, was killed. Soon after General Baird attained position near the enemy, General Davis' division, General Morgan commanding, formed on his right, and later, General Johnson's division took po sition in the rear of Morgan. As on the 3d, there was great activity along the line of the left to divert attention from the advance on the right. Thus there was just sufficient extension and action on the right to advise the enemy of what was intended, without gain ing any advantage that promised ultimate success. The line had only been extended by one division. General Sherman's orders required that the attack on the right should be pressed, and he had given promise that if it was too hard pressed, Generals Thomas and Howard should attack somewhere, but the indications were emphatic that General Hood was rapidly extending his intrenchments toward East Point, and yet Gen eral Sherman was so shut up to counter-movement, that he said to General Thomas in the evening, \" We will try again to-morrow, and proceed to the end.\" Accordingly, the next morning a new effort was made to reach beyond the enemy's left flank. The Fourteenth Corps, under command of Brigadier-General R. W. Johnson, by virtue of seniority, General Palmer having been relieved at his own request, held its own line and that occupied by the Twenty -third Corps, and the latter moved to the right, beyond what appeared the day before to be the left flank of the en-"], [143, "SIEGE OF ATLANTA. 129 emy. General Schofield then threw forward Reilly's brigade, but it was found impossible to penetrate the obstructions be fore the enemy's parapets. General Schofield then made a still larger circuit to the right, for the purpose of \" breaching\" his line at a point not protected by abatis, but he found his lines extended beyond the main TJtoy creek. While General Schofield was operating against General Hood's left, the latter evinced great activity on his right. He felt General Thomas' line from right to left, and was so demonstrative against Gen eral Stanley, as to make it evident that he was either looking for a weak point to assault, or was endeavoring to ascertain the strength of his line, as throwing light upon General Scho field's movements. General Hood was now holding his works north of the city by state troops, supported by movable divis ions of regular troops. The main portion of the army was on his left, extending his defenses to hold the Macon railroad. General Sherman's line was also greatly attenuated, and as a compensation for it, the defenses on the north were made ex ceedingly strong, and from them shells were constantly thrown to the city. In the evening of the 6th, General Sherman said to General Schofield : \" There is no alternative but for you to continue to work on that flank with as much caution as possible, and it is possible the enemy may attack us, or draw out.\" To General Thomas, he said : \" Instead of going round East Point, I would prefer the enemy to weaken, so we may break through at some point, and wish you to continue to make such effort. I will instruct General Howard to do the same at the head of TJtoy creek, his right.\" But Gen eral Thomas did not deem it prudent to assault such works, as there was a certainty of great loss, and with such a column, as he could form from his attenuated line, there was little probability of success. His response was : \" I will keep the attention of the enemy fully occupied by threatening all along my front ; but I have no hopes of breaking through his lines anywhere in my front, as long as he has a respectable force to defend them. My troops are so thinned out that it will be impossible to form an assaulting column sufficiently strong to VOL. II \u2014 9"], [144, "130 SIEGE OF ATLANTA. make an attack sure.\" In the emergency, General Sherman ordered heavy rifled guns from Chattanooga to \" batter the town.\" On the 7th, General Hood withdrew his troops from the intrenchments assaulted by General Schofield, which, though strong and well protected by entanglements, formed no part of his main line, and their abandonment did not greatly en danger his possession of the Macon railroad. During the day the Fourteenth Corps advanced, carried a line of rifle-pits in front of the position previously occupied by the Twenty -third Corps, and established a line close to the enemy's works. The loss of the corps was seventy men killed, and four hundred and thirteen wounded. One hundred and seventy-two prison ers were taken. From the 8th to the 10th, General Sherman continued his effort to reach the Macon road, by the extension of his line to the right. He thought it impossible that the enemy could reach much farther in that direction, but it was finally ascer tained that his well-fortified line extended from the Decatur road, on the east of Atlanta, to East Point, a distance of fif teen miles. And as the farther attenuation of the investins: line was not considered safe, and as the enemy's works were too strong to be assaulted, General Sherman began to cast about for a new plan. In the meantime, the heavy guns were at work throwing solid shell into the city with great fre quency, night and day, in expectation that their agency would reduce the value of Atlanta as a \" large machine-shop and depot of supplies.\" On the 11th, General Sherman received intelligence through General Garrard, that General Hood was collecting an im mense force of cavalry to operate upon his communications. It was important to General Hood to cut short General Sher man's supplies, but in the effort to do it, by breaking his rail road far to the north, he was depriving his own communica tions of protection. As soon as General Sherman learned that Wheeler, with eight or ten thousand troopers, was mov ing to the north, he determined to throw his cavalry upon the railroad south of Atlanta. The news from the north on the 14th gave confirmation to"], [145, "SIEGE OF ATLANTA. 131 previous reports of Wheeler's intended raid. Early in the morning of that day he attacked a party guarding a large herd of cattle near Calhoun, dispersed a portion of the guard and captured a large number of the cattle, some portions of which were recaptured by Colonel Faulkner, who pursued upon receipt of the news. At 3 p. m. General Steedman, at Chattanooga, was informed that Wheeler was going toward Dalton. He at once relieved all the troops that could be spared from the garrison to prepare to move to Dalton. Be ing delayed by trains running on unusual time, General Steed man did not reach the vicinity of Dalton until midnight ; and having been informed that the garrison had surrendered, he awaited daylight, and then moved forward and engaged the enemy's skirmishers. Hearing firing in Dalton, and learning that the garrison was still holding out, he dashed into the town and cleared it of the enemy. He remained for a day, and learning that the enemy had moved off, through fear for the bridges over the Chickamauga) he hastened back to Chatta nooga. Colonel Laiboldt had held his position against a supe rior force, and General Steedman's quick relief gave him final safety. The troops under General Steedman were the Second Missouri, Twenty-ninth, Fifty-first, and Sixty-eighth Indiana, Seventy-eighth Pennsylvania, One Hundred and Eighth Ohio, and the Fourteenth United States Colored troops, in all about eighteen hundred effective men. Wheeler's loss was about two hundred. He left thirty-three dead and fifty-seven badly wounded on the field. Steedman's, was one officer and eight men killed, one officer and twenty-nine men wounded, and twenty-three men missing. From Dalton, General Wheeler moved north, injured the railroad slightly at Graysville, threatened Cleveland with a detachment, and then turned to the northeast. Soon after, however, he changed his course to meet in Middle Tennessee another cavalry force under General Roddy. The latter had crossed the Tennessee river, near Decatur, to strike the Nash ville and Decatur railroad. General Wheeler's primary object was to damage the Nashville and Chattanooga railroad. About the same time, the enemy was active near Fort Donel son, thus giving a third intimation of purpose to disturb the"], [146, "132 SIEGE OF ATLANTA. communications of the.national armies before Atlanta. There was, however, less force in the raiding columns or more in the troops defending the railroads than had been anticipated, as little injury was effected. The failure resulted from the com bined opposition of General Rousseau, commanding at Nash ville, General Steedman at Chattanooga, and General R. S. Granger at Decatur. General Granger sallied forth from Decatur and encountered Roddy near Athens, Alabama, which place he was besieging. The garrison had been upon the defensive previously, but upou his arrival the barricades were removed, and the enemy was attacked and routed. General Granger then marched up the Nashville and Decatur railroad to Pulaski, to intercept Wheeler, who was moving to the west, followed by General Rousseau. From Pulaski he moved upon Linnville with three regiments of infantry, expecting General Starkweather to join him with a brigade of cavalry in time to give battle. He met his advance and drove it back, but his cavalry did not arrive in time to engage the enemy. During the night, Wheeler abandoned the line of the railroad and moved in the direction of Lawrenceburg. Granger then left his infantry to guard the railroad, and assuming personal command of his cavalry went in pursuit ; and overtaking the enemy as he was leaving Lawrenceburg, he fell upon Wheeler's rear-guard and harassed him as he retreated. At this juncture, General Rousseau ordered General Granger to halt and form a junc tion with his own force. For a time the order was not obeyed, upon the supposition that General Rousseau was ignorant of the fact that he was up with the enemy and was retarding his retreat. A second order was received, requiring him to discon tinue the pursuit and move upon Athens to intercept Roddy. The result was that both Wheeler and Roddy succeeded in crossing the Tennessee river without loss or embarrassment. The enemy thus escaped serious punishment, but utterly failed to interrupt General Sherman's communications. Having despaired of flanking Hood out of Atlanta, on the 16th General Sherman announced his new plan of operations, but suspended them first to learn the results of a raid by Kil patrick to Fairburn, and subsequently until his cavalry could"], [147, "SIEGE OF ATLANTA. 133 make one more effort to break up General Hood's communi cations and compel him to fight or abandon the city. General Kilpatrick drove back Jackson's division of cavalry from Fairburn on the 15th, destroyed the station and public build ings, and the telegraph and railroad for about three miles. On the 18th, he, with his own division and two brigades from Gen eral Garrard's, in all about five thousand cavalry, dashed out from his camp at Sandtown to the West Point road, and broke it near Fairburn, and thence moved to Jonesborough, defeated Ross' cavalry, and commenced the destruction of the road ; but while thus engaged he was attacked by Jackson's cavalry and a brigade of infantry, which had hurried up from the south, and he was compelled to draw off toward McDonough. He then made a circuit to Lovejoy's Station, where again, while breaking the road, he was attacked by the same force. Per ceiving that he was almost surrounded, he charged the cav alry and cut his way through, capturing four guns aud many prisoners ; but being hard pressed could not incumber himself with all of his captives, and brought in but seventy men, three flags, and one gun. He then returned by McDonough and Decatur. EXTRACT FROM GENERAL MORGAN'S REPORT OF HIS ACTION ON THE 28TH OF JULY. July 28th, received orders to be ready with my brigade at 8 a. m. ; re ported to General Davis for orders ; was informed by him that he was too unwell to take command of the division in the field. At 9 a. m. took command of the division on the Turner Ferry road, to move under the following order : v>~ \" July 28, 1864. Major-General G. H. Thomas: \" Order General Davis to leave camp and move to Turner's ferry, and then by a road leading toward East Point, to feel forward for Howard right back with some known point at Turner's ferry. I will be over on that flank all day, and await to reach out as far as possible. (Signed,) \" W. T. Sherman.\" In compliance with above order, I did move to Turner's ferry, halted an hour for rest and dinner. Having no guide, no correct map of the country, I had to rely upon such information as I could obtain from resi dents. Returning from the ferry, turned to the right at the church, one mile from the river, and took the road leading toward East Point. The enemy's pickets were soon met upon the road ; they were well posted and"], [148, "134 SIEGE OF ATLANTA. in good numbers, requiring the deployment of a whole regiment to clear the front. After moving upon this road about one and a half miles, a staff officer of the general commanding division overtook the command, and I re ceived verbal orders to return as soon as possible to the Turner's Ferry road, the enemy having attacked General Howard's right. Heavy skirmishing continuing in front, I determined to advance and take the first road to the left. This was done, and the division was moved with all possible dispatch to Turner's Ferry road, arriving late in evening, and owing to a bad swamp and a very dark night, was nearly all night in getting into camp. Headquarters Military Division op the Mississippi, In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., July 30, 1864. Generals Thomas and Howard : I am just back from an interview with General Schofield. I think General Stoneman has gone to Macon, east of Yellow river, and that is well. I have ordered General Garrard in on our left, and to-mor row night will let him fill with a skirmish line General Schofield's position, and move all of Schofield's to the right of General Howard, and with the divisions of General Davis and Ward kept in reserve on the right, to strike a blow beyond our new right flank when intrenched. Our right flank must be advanced in close and absolute contact with the enemy; and with General Schofield on that flank, I think we can make him quit Atlanta, or so weaken his line that we can break through somewhere, the same a3 our Kenesaw move. .

Major-General Schofield, with his own command and General Palmer's corps, will move directly on the railroad which leads south out of Atlanta, at any point between Whitehall and East Point, and will not stop until he has absolute control of the railroad, but must not extend more to the right than is absolutely necessary to that end. II. Major-Generals Thomas and Howard will press close on the enemy at all points, and reinforce well the points of the line where the enemy i9 most likely to sally \u2014 viz., on the Decatur, Buckhead, and Turner's Ferry roads; but more especially watch the outlet along the railroad \u2014 viz., General Williams' front. III. On the right we must assume the offensive, and every man be pre pared to fight, leaving knapsacks, etc., in present trenches. Wagons will not be taken east of Utoy creek, until General Schofield has secured position on the railroad, or so near it that it can be reached by musket balls and canister. If necessary to secure this end, ordinary parapets must be charged and carried, and every hour's delay enables the enemy to strengthen ; therefore, let it be done to-day. By order of Major-General W.

Get some part of your command where you can easily reach the railroad with short-range guns, and then intrench a strong flank. It is worth a battle, and the closer the first advantages are followed up, the better. The weakest point of the enemy must be mathematically at some point between Atlanta and East Point.

The movement of the army against the Macon railroad will begin Thursday night, August 18th, and will be continued on the following gen eral plan : I. All army commanders will send across the Chattahoochee river, and within the old rebel works at the bridge, and down as far as Turner's ferry, all surplus wagons, horses, men, and materials not absolutely necessary to the success of the expedition, and will collect in their wagons, with best teams, bread, meat, sugar, coffee, etc., for fifteen (15) days, after the nine teenth (19th) instant, and ammunition, and park them near TJtoy creek. First move. \u2014 General Kilpatrick's cavalry will move to Camp creek ; Gen eral Schofield will cover the Campbelton road, and General Thomas will move one corps (General Williams' ) to the Chattahoochee bridge, with orders to hold it; Paice's ferry bridge, and pontoon bridge (Captain Kossack's) at Turner's ferry, ready to be laid down if necessary. The other corps (General Stanley's) will move south of Proctor's creek, to near Utoy, behind the right center of the Army of the Tennessee, prepared to cover the Bell's Ferry road. General Garrard's cavalry will fall behind Peachtree creek, and act against the enemy should he sally against Gen eral Williams or General Stanley's corps during the movement. Second move. \u2014 The Army of the Tennessee will withdraw cross Utoy creek, and move by most direct road toward Fairburn, going as far as Camp"], [153, "SIEGE OF ATLANTA. 139 creek. General Thomas will mass his two corps (General Stanley's and Johnson's) below Utoy creek, and General Garrard's cavalry will join Gen eral Thomas by most direct road, or by way of Sandtown bridge, and act with him during the rest of the move. General Schofield will advance abreast of and in communication with the Army of the Tennessee as far as Camp creek. Third move. \u2014 The Armies of the Ohio and Tennessee will move direct for the West Point road, aiming to strike it between Red Oak and Fair burn. General Thomas will follow, well closed up into two columns, the trains between. General Kilpatrick will act as advance, and General Garrard will cover the rear, under direction of General Thomas. The bridges at Sandtown will be kept and protected by a detachment of cavalry, detailed by General Elliott, with a section of guns or four (4) gun battery. II. During the movement, and until the army returns to the river, the utmost care will be taken to expose as little as possible the trains of cars and wagons. The depots at the bridge, at Allatoona and Marietta, will be held against any attack, and communication kept up with the army as far as possible by way of Sandtown. On reaching any railroad, the troops will at once be disposed for defense, and at least one-third put to work to tear up track and destroy iron, ties, and all railroad material.

General Grant, City Point : I have your dispatches of 14th and 16th, and also that of 18th. I will never take a step backward, and have no fears of Hood. I can whip him outside of his trenches, and, I think, in time can compel him to come out. I think at this time I have a fine cavalry force on the only road which can feed him, and, if necessary, will swing my whole army across it also. W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General Commanding."], [154, "140 CHAPTER XXXII. THE FLANK MOVEMENT CULMINATING IN THE BATTLE OP JONESBORO AND THE FALL OF ATLANTA. Pending General Kilpatrick's movements the shelling of Atlanta was actively maintained, and feints of various kinds were employed by General Stanley on the left to confuse the enemy and lead to the belief that a movement was intended in that direction; but when, after General Kilpatrick's return, it was ascertained that the damage to the railroads was not such as to greatly embarrass the enemy, General Sherman re peated his order for the grand movement by the right flank, which involved the necessity of raising the siege of Atlanta, and using his armies against the communications of the enemy rather than against his intrenchments around the city. To take the place by siege would require too much time, and to take it by assault would cost too many lives. His sick, and all surplus supplies, wagons, and incumbrances, having been sent to the intrenchments beyond the Chattahoochee, the Fourth Corps was, on the 25th, withdrawn to the high ground, in the rear of the Twentieth Corps, to cover the retirement of the latter to the farther side of the Chattahoochee, to hold the railroad bridge and the bridges at Paice's and Turner's ferries, and guard the material there accumulated. Garrard's cavalry covered the movement of the Twentieth Corps to the rear, and that of the Fourth Corps to the right, to take position on the high ground along TJtoy creek. This change was effected on the 26th with but slight molestation, and the night following, the Fourteenth Corps, now in permanent command of Brevet Major-General J. C. Davis, was withdrawn from position and formed on the right of General Stanley, on Utoy creek. The"], [155, "FALL OF ATLANTA, ETC. 141 same night the Army of the Tennessee moved rapidly by a circuit toward Sandtown. General Schofield alone remained in position. The next day the Fourth Corps advanced to Mount Gilead Church, and, forming line of battle on the road to Fairburn, skirmished with the enemy's cavalry. The Fourteenth Corps remained in position, as it was necessary that one corps should cover another until out of reach of the enemy. General Garrard's cavalry operated upon the rear and left of the armies during these movements, and Kilpatrick's having crossed the Chattahoochee, at Paice's ferry, and recrossed at Sandtown, was charged with similar service on the right. The Twentieth Corps, at the Chattahoochee, passed to the command of Major- General H. W. Slocum. On the 28th, the Fourteenth Corps passed the Fourth at Mount Gilead, and reached its designated camp, near Red Oak, late in the afternoon. General Morgan's division, in the ad vance, skirmished with the enemy's cavalry during the day. The Fourth Corps followed, and the two corps encamped in line across the West Point railroad, facing east. The Army of the Tennessee was on the same road above Fairburn, and General Schofield was on this road below East Point. Shortly after dark, orders were received to destroy the railroad, by heating and twisting the rails and burning the ties. The work of destruction was continued through the night and a portion of the following day, by each army, and twelve and a half miles of the road were thoroughly dismantled. But this was not the road of most importance to the enemy. The Macon road passes to Jonesboro, from Atlanta, on the ridge dividing the waters of the Flint and Ocmulgee rivers, and offered a good position as a strategic base for ulterior movements, and on the 30th the armies advanced eastward to reach it, more directly in rear of Atlanta. The Fourth and Fourteenth Corps moved to Couch's house, formed a line trending to the northwest, and went into camp. The leading divisions of each corps skirmished with infantry and cavalry, and at night it was ascertained that there was a force of the enemy at Morrow's mill, on Crooked creek, three-fourths of a mile from General Stanley's left. General"], [156, "142 FALL OF ATLANTA, ETC. Thomas was in communication with General Howard beyond Renfrew's, but not with General Schofield on the left. General Garrard was guarding the left and rear, at Red Oak, and Gen eral Kilpatrick was on General Howard's right. General Sherman having ascertained that General Howard was near Jonesboro, directed General Thomas to send Stan ley's corps toward Rough and Ready, in connection wTith Schofield, and to send forward a strong detachment from the Fourteenth Corps to \" feel for the railroad.\" In compliance, General Baird, with his own division, and Mitchell's brigade of Morgan's division, was sent forward from the center, and an early advance discovered that the enemy's trains were in motion on a road to the east toward Jonesboro, and later in the day it was ascertained from captured stragglers that Har dee's and Lee's corps had passed. In the afternoon General Baird's leading detachment reached the railroad about four miles from Jonesboro. Although greatly in advance of other columns, General Baird determined to hold the railroad by strengthening Colonel Carleton's party in the advance, and sending Colonel Gleason's brigade for ward in support. The Fourth Corps formed a junction with the Twenty -third, at the railroad, and rested on the road south east of Rough and Ready, in a barricaded line facing Jones boro. Carlin's division, formerly Johnson's, moved to Ren frew's to cover the trains, and late in the afternoon was ordered to support General Howard, who had been attacked by Hardee's and Lee's corps. Carlin moved as ordered, but did not reach the field until after General Howard had completely repulsed the enemy. The situation was now partially developed. Two corps of Hood's army were at Jonesboro. It was not known that Stew art's corps had left Atlanta, but as the army was in force at Jonesboro, General Sherman determined to move against that place, and if Stewart was not there to thrust his forces between the two portions of Hood's army. Deeming it probable that the third corps would abandon Atlanta, he directed General Thomas to order General Slocum to make a reconnoissance toward Atlanta to determine the state of affairs, and also to send a cavalry force toward Decatur to observe the enemy in"], [157, "FALL OF ATLANTA, ETC. 143 that direction. Circumstances now indicated a speedy solution of all problems having connection with Atlanta. General Sherman's orders for September 1st required all the forces to turn upon Jonesboro. General Howard was already before it, and General Davis, with Morgan's and Carlin's divis ions, joined Baird's on the railroad, and the whole corps was soon on Howard's left. Generals Schofield and Stanley, having a longer march, and owing to railroad destruction and other causes, were greatly delayed. General Garrard was still in the rear, and General Kilpatrick was sent clown the west bank of Flint river to threaten the railroad below Jonesboro, and Gen eral Blair's corps of the Army of the Tennessee was sent in the same direction. This immense combination had been directed against Hardee's corps alone, which had been left behind to cover the retreat to a point where the dissevered army could be reunited. After occupying the position vacated by General Blair's corps, General Davis directed General Carlin to send a brigade to explore the ground toward the railroad upon which General Stanley was advancing. The reconnoissance was made by Edie's brigade of regulars, and was strongly resisted by the enemy. It was, however, pressed until a commanding hill beyond Mo ker's creek was carried, from the front of which the enemy's works could be attacked with advantage. At this juncture General Thomas reached the head of column, to whom General Davis reported the condition of affairs, and suggested a plan of operations. Having received permission to make the . attack directly before the hill which Edie had gained, General Davis pushed his troops in column to that point, and deployed for action. Carlin's second brigade was formed on the right of Edie's. General Morgan crossed the creek and connected the left of his division with Carlin's right. General Baird formed his division in rear of Carlin's left, which rested on the railroad. General Morgan's movement was executed over rough ground, and in exposure to the enemy's artillery. About the time that the formation of the Fourteenth Corps was completed, General Stanley's head of column appeared on Carlin's left, and Grose's and Kirby's brigades of Kimball's"], [158, "144 FALL OF ATLANTA, ETC. division were deployed, under instructions to push the enemy vigorously on the left of the railroad. The troops of the Fourteenth Corps designated for the at tack, were General Carlin's two brigades and General Morgan's entire division, and were formed in double lines, and as nearly contiguous as the ground would permit. The distance to the enemy from Morgan's division, when deployed, was about one thousand yards ; the intervening space was open, but swampy, and cut with ditches. The distance to the enemy's works in General Carlin's front could not be determined, as a dense thicket interposed. The defenses of the enemy were in the woods on a ridge, at various distances from the edge of the wooded ground, but in no case exceeding one hundred yards. Morgan's division was formed by brigades in column of regi ments in echelon, from left to right \u2014 Lum's, Mitchell's, and Dil worth's \u2014 and were ordered to assault with the bayonet alone. At 4 p. M., after a heavy cannonade from Prescott's and Gardner's batteries on Carlin's ridge, the troops moved for ward, but owing to the thickets in Carlin's front, and the swampy ground and ditches before Morgan, their progress was slow, and there was difficulty in maintaining alignments and direction. When the whole line had advanced to the slope of a hill, and an open field within three or four hundred yards of the enemy's position, it was halted for readjustment, the ground offering some protection. Thus far the enemy's fire had been only slightly felt, except by Edie's brigade, which was some distance in advance of the troops on the right, and had already carried a projection of the enemy's works, and was exposed to a most galling fire. To give Edie support, or rather to relieve him from position in the line, Este's brigade of Baird's division was thrown forward, and took part in the general attack which followed. . The other two brigades of Baird's division were retained on the left, to push the advan tage on that flank, should a general assault prove successful. At 5 p. M., the rectified lines again moved forward, and the attack was quickly and vigorously made along the whole bat tle front. There had been so many unsuccessful assaults made by both armies during the campaign, that the enemy regarded"], [159, "FALL OF ATLANTA, ETC. 145 this attempt to carry his intrenchments, so strongly defended, as an exhibition of folly and harmless audacity. But it was soon revealed that the most determined resistance could not arrest or defeat the bold assault. Morgan's division carried its entire front, and gloriously re versed the issue of its assault near Kenesaw Mountain on the 27th of June. The brigades of Mitchell and Dilworth there clung to the hillside under the enemy's guns, having failed in assault ; here they leaped the fortifications, and under sword and bayonet held captive the troops set for their de fense. Este's brigade was successful at once on its right, the Tenth Kentucky and Seventy -fourth Indiana gaining the intrench ments in their front ; but the Fourteenth and Thirty-eighth Ohio, on the left, met such obstructions, as compelled them to halt. They, however, held their ground under a fire of fearful effect. Colonel Este, who had been in the charge on his right, now turned his attention to his left, and meeting with Colonel W.T. C. Grower, Seventeenth New York, of General Morgan's left brigade, requested him to put in his regiment, which he did with great gallantry and success, though he was himself one of the first to fall. Joined by this regiment, Este's left carried the works in front, and captured a large number of prisoners. Moore's brigade, Carlin's left, encountered such obstructions as held it in check for a time, but finally joined the remainder of the assaulting troops in the enemy's works. Equal success on the part of the Fourth Corps might have resulted in the capture of Hardee's command ; but Kimball's and Newton's divisions were so delayed by the thick under growth, and the enemy's skirmishers, that they did not get before his main lines until 5 p. m., and then Grose and Kirby only succeeded in breaking through the entanglements in front of his barricade, while Newton, who was compelled to make a larger circuit, passed beyond the right flank of the enemy, when it was too dark to take advantage of his position. Although Hardee's corps was neither captured nor annihi lated \u2014 a conjectured result, had the troops on the left reached the field earlier \u2014 the action was the most brilliant and success- VOL. II \u2014 10"], [160, "146 FALL OF ATLANTA, ETC. ful of ita type during the campaign. All other assaults of main lines by either army had resulted in failure, and, as a general rule, the defensive in positive battle had been success ful ; but here a strongly intrenched line was carried, with the capture of nearly a thousand men, including one general offi cer, and many of inferior grades, also eight guns, aDd seven battle flags. During the night, about one thousand men in addition either surrendered or were captured. The contest closed so late in the evening that pursuit was impossible, and the troops bivouacked in the enemy's works connecting with the Fourth Corps at the railroad. During the night, Hardee fell back to Lovejoy's Station. The next morning the national forces followed, except the Fourteenth Corps, left behind to bury the dead and collect the material abandoned by the enemy. The troops in pursuit reached the vicinity of the station at noon. The Fourth Corps formed line of battle, and made preparations to attack the enemy who was busy fortifying a line across the railroad, a mile north. The necessity of resistance at this point had not been antici pated, and the enemy was extemporizing defenses. General Stanley's line was formed with Wood's division in the center, and Newton's and Kimball's on the right and left. As his attack was to be co-operative with the Army of the Tennessee, he waited for General Howard to fix the time, and at 3J P. m. as directed, advanced his line. Upon reaching the immediate vicinity of the enemy, he did not deem it advisable to attack at the railroad, as Hood's artillery swept this point completely. Supposing that the Army of the Tennessee would so hold the enemy by attack, that he -could reach his right flank, General Stanley advanced his center and left. The ground, however, was so unfavorable, on account of roughness, streams, and marshes, that Wood's and Kimball's divisions did not get near the position until nearly 6 p. M. While General Wood was selecting a point for attack, he received a wound which obliged him to relinquish his command. However, his left brigade, Knefler's, charged and carried the enemy's works, but could not maintain its hold, as it was subjected to an enfilading fire on both flanks. Kimball's column was exposed to a sweeping artillery fire, and the ground before them being open, the"], [161, "FALL OF ATLANTA, ETC. 147 order, to charge was countermanded. Both divisions in trenched. General Sherman did not deem it advisable subse quently to press the attack, as he was led to believe that Hood had halted merely to cover the roads to McDonough and Fayetteville, and that it was then too late to intercept Stewart's corps, reported to be in retreat from Atlanta upon McDonough. Pending the movement south of Atlanta, General Slocum strengthened the position at the Chattahoochee, and watched the enemy closely toward Atlanta. The explosions during the night of the 1st called forth a special reconnoissance. As Colonel Coburn, commanding the advance, approached the city on the 2d, he was met by the mayor, who made to him a formal surrender of the place. After entering Atlanta, Colonel Coburn exchanged a few shots with Ferguson's cavalry, act ing as a rear-guard of the retreating army, and captured one hundred men. General Slocum soon after occupied the city with seven brigades, and found twenty pieces of artillery and several hundred small arms ; but General Hood had destroyed almost all valuable material which he could not remove, in cluding eight locomotives and eighty-one cars loaded with ammunition and supplies. The explosion of the ammunition had been heard at Jonesboro, and was the first indication of the total abandonment of the place. As General Sherman had interposed between Stewart's corps at Atlanta, and Hardee's and Lee's on the Macon road, the retreat of the former was the only condition of safety. The losses in the engagements south of Atlanta amounted in the aggregate to twelve hundred men. Fifteen hundred of tire enemy wTere captured, and he left three hundred dead on the field of battle. September 3d, General Sherman announced the conclusion of the campaign, and gave orders for the return of his armies to Atlanta, to rest and recuperate until the enemy's move ments or some new plan of his own should call them again to action. As the enemy remained in his intrenchments at Love joy's Station, General Sherman did not withdraw his army at once. Both commanding generals sent their trains to the"], [162, "148 FALL OF ATLANTA, ETC. rear; and thus indicated a mutual disposition to widen the breach between them for a time at least. On the 5th, the Fourth Corps quietly withdrew from posi tion and joined the Fourteenth at Jonesboro, at daylight on the 6th. Though the general withdrawal was impeded by a rain-storm and consequent bad roads, it was successfully con ducted. The enemy manifested a disposition to annoy the two corps at Jonesboro, but there was no action beyond the exchange of a few shots. The next day, the army moved to Rough and Ready, the enemy refraining from pursuit, and went into camp on the 8th, on the outskirts of Atlanta \u2014 the Fourteenth Corps on the right of the Campbellton road, and the Twentieth and Fourth Corps to the east in reserve. Pick ets were thrown out well to the front upon commanding posi tions. Thus, Atlanta was gained after a campaign of four months, involving strategical and tactical combinations on a grand scale, but without a general decisive battle. General Sherman did not risk a general assault, and the Confederate generals did not offer battle with a broad front, except with intrenched lines ; but there were many engagements of great severity, and constant skirmishing on a scale that produced great waste of life. The fall of Atlanta was hailed by the Northern people as a result of great moment. The noise of cannon all over the land, orders of congratulation from Washington and army commanders gave expression to the general appreciation of the campaign and its issue. The moral effect of the consum mation was indeed great North and South, and yet, as no army had been destroyed or signally defeated, the possession of Atlanta was only a partial solution to the war problem in the West. The march southward of Sherman's armies, despite the heaviest concentration that could be made in resistance, the destruction of extensive manufactories of materials of war, and the palpable diminution of the central insurgent forces, were grand results indeed ; but the Confederate Army of the Tennessee was not annihilated, and until it and the one in Virginia- should be, the end of the war could not come. The end was indeed foreshadowed by the fact that the national armies could force their way into the South anywhere, sub-"], [163, "FALL OF ATLANTA, ETC. 149 ject to the one condition of supplies. But this war, beyond most wars, was a conflict of ideas, and the persistence of the parties to it revealed the overmastering force of the antago nistic opinions. The protraction of the war had intensified the original antagonisms, and had, besides, involved the two sections in debt to such an enormous extent that financial ruin was inevitable in the defeat of either. The success of the North would restore the Union and place its debt upon the whole country. The success of the South would be a division of the country, with a burden of debt to each portion of crush ing weight. So that now, not only the primal causes of the war and the extreme reluctance of a proud people to yield to an enemy, but financial considerations, precluded peace so long as the South could maintain armies. The campaigns of the summer had made a heavy draft upon the strength of the Con federate armies ; but the two which unfurled their banners before Grant and Sherman in May were intact, though one had been shut up in Richmond and the other had been bat tled and flanked out of Atlanta. General Canby and Admiral Farragut had neutralized Mobile, though the former had been bereft of the corps intended for its complete reduction to rein force the Army of the Potomac. There were troops yet in the Gulf States, east of the Mississippi, to raise Hood's army to its maximum strength, though their accretion would reveal the desperate straits of the insurgents. There were forces beyond the Mississippi, whose isolation hitherto, through the viligance of General Canby, had prevented a more potential combination against General Sherman in Georgia. These troops were raid ing in Missouri, and by predatory warfare were doing local mischief without affecting the general issue. The rebellion, then, was palpably resting upon the armies of Lee and Hood. The former, by political considerations, if not by purely mili tary ones, was restricted to the defense of the Confederate cap ital. Hood's army alone had freedom of motion, and to de termine how best to use that freedom was to the insurgent leaders the great problem of the hour. The aggregate casualties of the Army of the Cumberland, during the campaign, from the 1st of May to the 6th of Sep tember, were as follows : One hundred and ninety-six officers"], [164, "150 FALL OF ATLANTA, ETC. and two thousand eight hundred and forty-five men enlisted were killed ; eight hundred and ten officers aud fourteen thousand nine hundred and seventy -three enlisted men were wounded ; one hundred and four officers and two thousand six hundred and three enlisted men were captured \u2014 in all, twenty-one thousand five hundred and thirty -four men. Dur ing the campaign forty-three thousand one hundred and fifty three were reported sick to Major George E. Cooper, surgeon United States army, medical director of the department. Of these, twenty-six thousand one hundred and eighty -four were sent to the rear; two hundred and seven died from disease, and one thousand and sixty-seven died from wounds. Almost all others, sick or wounded, were returned to duty. General J. M. Brannan, chief of artillery, reported the cap ture of four guns by the Twentieth Corps, at Resaca, in battle, and four left by the enemy in his fortifications ; ten guns captured by General J. C. Davis, at Rome ; twenty left by the enemy in Atlanta, and eight captured by the Fourteenth Corps, at Jonesboro. He also reported the expenditure of 86,611 rounds of artillery ammunition, 11,815,299 rounds of infantry ammunition, and the loss of 1,439 artillery horses. During the period the army captured 8,067 men from the enemy and received 2,162 deserters, as reported by Colonel Parkhurst, provost marshal general of the department. These statistics reveal the cost of war. Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., August 13, 1864 \u2014 8 p. m. General Halleck, Washington, D. C. : We have now pressed the enemy's lines from the east around to East Point on the south. The nature of the ground, with its artificial defenses, makes it too difficult to assault, and to reach the road by a further exten sion will be extra hazardous. I have ordered army commanders to pre pare for the following plan : Leave one corps strongly intrenched at the Chattahoochee bridge in charge of our suplus wagons and artillery ; with sixty thousand (60,000) men reduced to fighting trim, to make circuit of devastation around the town, with a radius of fifteen or twenty miles. To do this, I go on faith that the militia in Atlanta are only good for the defense of its parapets, and will not come out. I would like the utmost activity to be kept up in Mobile Bay, and if"], [165, "FALL OF ATLANTA, ETC. 151 possible, about the mouth of Apalachicola ; also, to be assured that no material reinforcements have come here from Virginia. If ever I should be cut off from my base, look out for me about St. Marks, Florida, or Savannah, Georgia. W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General. Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., August 13, 1864. General Halleck, Washington, D. C. : In making the circuit of Atlanta, as proposed in my dispatch of to-day, I necessarily run some risk. If there be any possibility of Admiral Far ragut and the land forces of Gordon Granger taking Mobile (which rebel prisoners now report, but the report is not confirmed by Macon papers of the 11th, which I have seen), and further, of pushing up to Montgomery, my best plan would be to wait awhile as now, and, at proper time, to move down to West Point, and operate into the heart of Georgia from there. Before cutting loose, as proposed, I would like to know the chances of our getting the use of the Alabama river this campaign. I could easily break up the railroads back to Chattanooga, and shift my whole army down to West Point and Columbus, a country rich in corn, and make my fall campaign from there. I know Fort Morgan must succumb in time. W. T. SHERMAN, Major- General. Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., August 17, 1864.

Soldiers of the Army of the Cumberland: The major-general commanding, with pride and pleasure, congratu lates you upon the fact that your achievements during the campaign"], [168, "154 FALL OF ATLANTA, ETC. which has just closed, in connection with those of the Armies of the Tennessee and Ohio, have received such distinguished marks of appre ciation as the thanks of the President of the United States, and of the major-general commanding the Military Division of the Mississippi. Your commander now desires to add his to those you have already re ceived, for the tenacity of purpose, unmurmuring endurance, cheerful obedience, brilliant heroism, and all those high qualities which you have displayed to an eminent degree, in attacking and defeating the cohorts of treason, driving them from position after position, each of their own choosing, cutting their communications, and in harassing their flanks and rear, during the many marches, battles, and sieges of this long and event ful campaign. It is impossible, within the limits of an order like this, to enumerate the many instances in which your gallantry has been conspicuous, but among them may be mentioned the actions of Rocky Face Mountain and before Dalton, fought between the 8th and 13th of May; of Resaca, on the 14th and 15th; of Adairsville, on the 17th, and of New Hope Church, on the 25th of the same month ; of Gulp's Farm, June 22d ; Peach tree creek, July 20th, and the crowning one of Jonesboro, fought Sep tember 1st, which secured the capture of the city of Atlanta, the goal for which we set out more than four months ago, and furnished a brilliant termination to your struggles for that long period. Let these successes encourage you to the continued exercise of those same high qualities, and to renewed exertions in the cause of our country and humanity when you shall again be called upon to meet the foe; and be assured, the time is not far distant when your prowess will conquer what territory now remains within the circumscribed limits of the re bellion. A few more fields like those whose names now crowd your standards, and we can dictate the terms of a peace alike honorable to yourselves and our country. You can then retire to your homes amid the plaudits of your friends, and with the proud consciousness that you have deserved well of the country. Our rejoicings are not unmixed with a proud regret for our brave com rades who have fallen. Their graves mark the spots where they went down amid the din and roar of battle, dotting every field and hillside, or lying beneath the spreading boughs of the forest along our route; they will, in suture days, serve like finger-boards, to point out to the traveler the march of your victorious columns. Those silent mounds appeal to us to remain true to ourselves and the country, and to so discharge the high duty devolving upon us that their lives, which they so freely offered up, may not prove a useless sacrifice. By command of Major-General Thomas. WM. D. WHIPPLE, Assistant Adjutant-General-"], [169, "155 CHAPTER XXXIII. THE MARCH OF THE OPPOSING ARMIES TO THE NORTH AND THE EVOLUTION OF NEW CAMPAIGNS \"When General Sherman, August 13th, informed General Halleck that he would make the circuit of Atlanta with his armies, he suggested that it might be prudent to break up the railroad to Chattanooga, and shift his armies to \"West Point and Columbus, and there make his base for the fall campaign. To this General Grant replied, advising that there should be no backward movement, even if his roads should be so cut as to preclude the possibility of supplies from the North, and said : \" If it comes to the worst, move South as you suggest.\" After General Sherman had taken the city, without overthrow ing the army which had so long defended it, he was occupied with the question of its use in future operations. That he might hold it for purely military purposes, he banished the citizens, giving them choice to go North or South ; and as the defenses constructed by the enemy were so extensive that only an army could utilize them, he established an inner line of works, which, held by an ordinary garrison, would protect his depots. That he might accumulate supplies for future enter prise, he restricted the railroads to persons connected with the army, and the transportation of military stores. But under lying these essential preparations, even to hold Atlanta defen sively, there was the grand problem of farther aggression. To hold Atlanta and the long railroad to his primary base, and have forces to advance, in the manner of his previous move ment, required an impracticable augmentation. As the enemy was now free to detach heavily, to break his communications, he was compelled to send troops to the rear, and, besides this"], [170, "156 MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. draft, he was constantly losing regiments by expiration of term of service. Despairing of being able to cling to the rail roads in advancing from Atlanta, he, in common with General Grant, was looking for a southern base to which he might leap, without intervening communications. General Grant suggested that General Canby should act upon Savannah, and General Sherman upon Augusta. General Sherman in reply expressed his willingness \" to move upon Milledgeville, and compel Hood to give up Macon and Augusta, and then turn upon the other,\" if he could be assured of finding provisions at Augusta or Columbus; but without such assurance he would risk his army by going far from Atlanta. The country, in any direction southward, would supply an army that could maintain motion and freedom to forage, but the contingency of slow maneuvers or stopping to dislodge an intrenched enemy, coupled with constraint in foraging, was the barrier to a campaign having a remote objective. The questions of the direction and object of an advance, though discussed at length by Generals Grant and Sherman, remained unsettled until General Hood's movements gave a turn to affairs which had not been anticipated by either. Soon after the fall of Atlanta, the Southern President left Richmond to confer with his western generals with regard to the next campaign, and to use his eloquence to rouse the people from despondency. His removal of General Johnston from command had not averted disaster. He had watched the closing in of the national lines around his capital, but the con ditions of warfare were there inveterately defined, and he sped to the \"West to give shape to some new enterprise in solution of the problems imposed by the issue of the preceding dis astrous campaign. It would have been well had he called General Johnston to Palmetto, and this he doubtless would have done, had his sole object been to give a successful issue to a new campaign; but even in this supreme moment, personal considerations were dominant, and the justification of his removal of his ablest western general from command, took rank with the projects which involved the fate of the Confederacy. He now needed judicious counsel, for another campaign of dire issue would be"], [171, "MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. 157 fatal. Nearly one hundred thousand national troops were holding Atlanta, and preparing to utilize all the advantages gained in the previous campaign. It was not possible to in crease Hood's army promptly to such an extent as to justify direct offense in open field, much less against Atlanta. The Confederate leaders were then restricted to the continuance of the defensive, wherever General Sherman should invite de fense, or to some diversion that would retard or avert the blow which he was meditating. It was decided that Hood's army should be thrown upon General Sherman's communica tion, and the forces under Smith and Magruder called over the Mississippi river for conjunction in Northern Alabama ; that the united armies, gathering recruits as they advanced, should sweep through Tennessee and Kentucky, and stand a hundred thousand strong upon the banks of the Ohio. Critics have been swift to condemn Hood's advance to the North, and considered as an independent movement, it is seemingly, at least, open to criticism ; but regarded as a part of a compre hensive plan, it is not apparent that his army could have been used to better advantage. That the expectation of gathering a vast army on the Tennessee river was the inspiration of Hood's movement, which in itself promised no mean results, is plainly true ; for before he had crossed the Chattahoochee, the Confederate President sent an order (which General Canby intercepted) to Smith and Magruder to cross the Mississippi river with their forces. The assumption of the practicability of their conjunction with Hood, is the explana tion of Mr. Davis' prophetic declarations in speeches through out the South, that should the absent soldiers return to their colors, General Sherman should be forced into a retreat as dis astrous as that of Napoleon from Moscow, and the Confeder ate army would advance in triumph to the Ohio river. The precedents of the war were against the plan itself, as even in the first flush of the rebellion all aggression with remote ob jectives had resulted in failure ; while in no case during the conflict, had a Confederate army been thrown with ultimate advantage upon the communications of a national army whose aggressive pressure could not be resisted. Latterly, all de fense in the \"West had been unsuccessful, and the disparity of"], [172, "158 MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. aggregate forces forbade all sober-minded Southerners the hope that any plan could be devised whose execution would arrest, much less avert the downfall of the rebellion. General Hood remained at Lovejoy's Station, quietly recu perating and reinforcing his army, until the 20th of September, when those on the outlook informed General Sherman that he was in motion. General Sherman's first thought was that he was drawing back to Macon, and would send reinforcements to Richmond. The next day, however, it wTas apparent that General Hood had only shifted his army to Palmetto Station, and was there intrenching. This movement, and the appear ance of Forrest with a force of six or eight thousand men in Tennessee, were the first steps in the execution of the new plan of operations. General Sherman now surmised that General Hood had resolved to throw his army on his flanks, to prevent the accumulation of supplies, and made dispositions to thwart him. He sent General Newton's division to Chattanooga, and ordered General Corse to unite his division at Rome, to act against any force that might threaten Bridgeport from the di rection of Gadsden. Having provided for the defense of these important points, he left the disposition of Forrest to the dis trict commanders \u2014 Generals Steedman, Granger, and Rousseau. A raid from Forrest into Middle Tennessee had been ex pected by those in the rear, though not by those in the front. About the 12th of the month, General Granger received through his scouts information, which he deemed reliable, that such was his purpose, if the corps of General A. J. Smith had been re moved from West Tennessee. He therefore expressed his con victions to General Sherman, and asked if Smith's corps had left Tennessee. General Sherman directed General Thomas to inform him that he need feel no uneasiness about Forrest, as he had gone to Mobile. Notwithstanding this positive assurance that there was no danger, General Granger sent a force to re connoiter in the direction of Forrest's anticipated approach. In obedience to his order, Lieutenant-Colonel Elliott, command ing the Sixth Tennessee Cavalry, advanced toward Florence, and having returned to the main road, after a short detour, found himself in the rear of a cavalry force of eight or ten thousand men. And thus was positively revealed the first of"], [173, "MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. 159 a series of aggressive movements on the part of the enemy, which gave a new complexion and unexpected issues to mili tary operations in Tennessee and Georgia. September 25th, it was supposed that General Hood was moving toward the Alabama line, and this opening of the way for a march to the sea, turned General Sherman to the consid eration of a movement thither without an intermediate base of supplies. General Grant, however, suggested that his at tention should first be given to affairs in his rear, and appre ciating the situation in Tennessee, and knowing that desperate efforts would be made to force Sherman to relax his grasp upon Georgia, ordered all the spare troops in the West to Nashville, that no further reduction of forces at Atlanta might be necessary. On the 28tb, General Sherman said to General Grant : \" I want Apalachicola arsenal taken, also Savannah, and if the enemy does succeed in breaking my road, I can fight my way to one or the other place, but I think it better to hold on to Atlanta and strengthen to my rear, and there fore I am glad that you have ordered troops to Nashville.\" And to President Lincoln, he said : \" It would have a bad effect, if I am forced to send back any material part of my army to guard roads, so as to weaken me to an extent that I could not act offensively, if the occasion calls for it.\" Cling ing thus to Atlanta, he was nevertheless so apprehensive with regard to his communications, that he sent General Thomas to the north to provide for their security, having previously ordered General Morgan's division to Chattanooga, and a bri gade of the Army of the Tennessee, and the cavalry from Memphis, to Eastport, to operate against the flank of any force going into Tennessee by any of the fords near Florence. General Thomas started on the 29th, and the same day there came to General Sherman the first intimation that Hood was crossing the Chattahoochee. The day following it was known that a portion of his army was across, and by the first of Oc tober the movement was well developed, except in respect to its ultimate object. The direction of the march did not indi cate an advance to Blue Mountain, but toward General Sher man's communications, and citizens reported that Rome was General Hood's destination. In doubt of his purpose and"], [174, "160 MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. destination, General Sherman made provision for two contin gencies \u2014 the enemy swinging across to the Alabama line and thence into Tennessee, or striking the railroad south of King ston. In the one case, he proposed to send back to Chatta nooga all the troops from Kingston north, and with all south of Kingston to move to the sea-board, and in the other, he would turn upon Hood and attack him. To ascertain the direction of the enemy's march before put ting his own armies in motion, General Sherman sent General Garrard to Powder Springs, General Kilpatrick to Sweet water, General Howard to reconnoiter to Fairburn, and Gen eral Cox, commanding the Twenty-third Corps in absence of General Schofield, to send a division to Flat Rock. His ob ject, in addition, was to get the bridges over the Chattahoo chee, and then place his armies between them and General Hood. But the latter was indifferent to all such designs, as he had cut loose from all connections in his rear. General Sherman regarded his movement as ostentatious, but it was one of desperation rather, and right boldly did he and his army dash on to the issues involved. He was vigorously ex ecuting his part of the grand combination which had been projected, to change, if possible, the theater and the issue of the war in the \"West. Having crossed the Chattahoochee, he threw Stewart's corps upon the railroad north of Marietta, and with the remainder of his infantry forces, moved toward Dallas, his cavalry, under \"Wheeler, being already in Northern Georgia. Stewart reached the railroad, and commenced its destruction, October 2d, and citizens reported that it was Gen eral Hood's purpose to attack Acworth and Allatoona, after ward Rome, and in the event of repulse, to retreat to Blue Mountain, Jacksonville, and Selma. General Sherman now ordered General Stanley to move with ten days' rations to Ruff's Station, and open communications with General El liott, who, with his cavalry divisions, was over toward Sweet water and Nose's creek. The next day, he ordered all his remaining forces, except the Twentieth Corps, which was left to hold Atlanta and the railroad bridge over the Chatta hoochee, to follow Stanley. In the evening of the 4th, the advance of the latter encamped near Little Kenesaw Moun-"], [175, "MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. 161 tain. General Hood's infantry was then advancing upon Al latoona, having captured the garrisons at Big Shanty and Acworth, and destroyed the track of the road for several miles. The same day, General Elliott found the enemy be tween Dallas and Big Shanty, occupying the old works of the national army, in more force than could be dislodged by dis mounted cavalry. General Sherman had been convinced of General Hood's audacity too late to protect his communications, and was now anxious with regard to his depot of supplies at Allatoona. He had previously ordered General Corse to reinforce the gar rison from Rome, should the enemy approach from the south ; and this provision saved the place. General Corse reached Allatoona with a few regiments, on the 4th, and the next morning he was attacked by French's division of Stewart's corps. General Sherman, while signaling his presence at Kenesaw Mountain, and his purpose to give the earliest pos sible support, witnessed the repeated repulse of the enemy. The gallant resistance of the garrison, and the movement of General Cox to his left, induced General French to withdraw entirely during the afternoon, having lost at least a thousand men. This was not a promising initiative for General Hood, and its probable bearing upon his plans was added to other circumstances of positive character to conceal again, for a few days, his ultimate purpose. French's division remained in the rear of the army, and offered such resistance to General El liott, that it was impossible to ascertain in what direction the enemy's standards were pointing. From the 5th to the 10th, it was not known whether they were pointing northward or westward. During this period, General Sherman again proposed to General Grant to break up the railroad to Chattanooga, and move with wagons to Savannah, entertaining the opinion that Hood would move to the \"West. But on the 10th, learning that he was marching toward Rome, he ordered his generals to move upon Kingston with a view to support General Corse at Rome, should the enemy approach in force. General Hood crossed the Coosa river twelve miles below, in feint upon VOL. II \u2014 11"], [176, "162 MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. Rome, to cover another dash upon the railroad and his march northward. General Sherman's forces were concentrated in the vicinity of Kingston on the 11th, but again General Hood's movements were in doubt, as he disappeared from the vicinity of Rome without indicating where he was going. General Sherman, on the 12th, made effort to develop his movements, by sending Garrard's division* and the Twenty-third Corps across the Oostanaula, while a brigade from Hazen's division moved down the Coosa from Rome. In the meantime, Hood moved rapidly toward Resaca with his whole army. Here, again, provision had been made to reinforce the garrison, as, in compliance with General Sherman's contingent orders, the troops at Cassville, Colonel Watkins' brigade of cavalry, and General Baum, with three hundred and fifty infantry, moved forward before the place was invested. Colonel \"Watkins left his horses on the left bank, and placed his men in the intrench ments on the other side. General Hood demanded the sur render of the place on the 11th, under the threat that no pris oners would be taken if he should be compelled to carry the works by assault. But though General Baum refused to capitulate, and General Hood had a heavy force, probably two corps present, and threw a line around the town from the river above to the river below, he may have been deterred from attack by the uncertainty of the issue, or may have considered the temporary possession no compensation for the cost of tak ing it. While halting before Resaca, General Hood sent detach ments to destroy the railroad toward Dalton, and having him self withdrawn on the 12th, he demanded the surrender of the latter place the next day. Colonel Johnson, commanding the Forty-fourth Colored regiment, was convinced that resist ance was useless, and accepted terms. The garrison at Tilton was also captured. Early in the day, General Schofield had reached Dalton on his way to join General Sherman, but not being able to go farther, and learning that the enemy was ad vancing, he returned to Cleveland with his train and what * General Garrard drove a brigade of the enemy through the entrance to Chattooga valley, and captured two guns."], [177, "MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. 163 public property it was practicable to save. From Dalton, General Hood, with Lee's and Cheatham's corps, passed into Snake Creek Gap. Stewart's corps destroyed the railroad to Tunnel Hill. General Sherman reached Resaca on the 14th, and disposed his forces to strike the enemy in flank, or force him to fight by shutting him up in Snake Creek Gap. He sent General Howard to the southern entrance, and General Stanley, with his own and Davis' corps, by Tilton, to the northern entrance. But though General Howard skirmished io hold General Hood in the pass until General Stanley should reach his rear, his effort was ineffectual, as he retreated to the north before Stanley could intercept him by closing the Gap. Having emerged from the pass, General Hood had freedom of motion north and west. On the 16th, General Sherman threw Tris columns to Lafayette to cut off his retreat, but he was able to unite his forces in time to attain a safe position between the Coosa and Lookout Mountain. Reference should here be made to operations by which For rest was expelled from Tennessee. This bold trooper crossed the Tennessee river at \"Waterloo, September 20th, and two days afterward appeared before Athens, Alabama. Colonel Camp bell, commanding the post, after skirmishing with the enemy for a short time, withdrew from the town to the fortifications. This step exposed the public buildings and stores, and Forrest immediately applied the torch. The next day he invested the fort, which had been constructed for defense by a small force, and opened with his artillery. Colonel Campbell responded with spirit, and refused two calls to surrender, but finally, through a personal interview with Forrest, was induced to conclude that resistance was useless. Forrest adopted the policy, which in many instances was successful, to make a show of force to in duce surrender, when there was no intention to attack, or at least a great reluctance to do so, in view of inevitable loss or uncertain issue. The garrison surrendered consisted of four hundred and fifty men of the One Hundred and Sixth, One Hundred and Tenth, and One Hundred and Eleventh Colored regiments, and one hundred and thirty men of the Third Ten nessee Cavalry. A half hour later, the Eighteenth Michigan and One Hundred and Third Ohio arrived, and were surren-"], [178, "164 MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. dered after an engagement. This was an auspicious beginning for Forrest, but fortunately proved to be his only important success. From Athens he advanced toward Pulaski, and destroyed the Nashville and Decatur railroad for several miles. At Pu laski, General Rousseau was awaiting his coming with such force that Forrest withdrew after a skirmish. The same day, the 29th, one of his detachments appeared on the Nashville and Chattanooga road, north and south of Tullahoma, cut the tele graph wires, and injured the track. The road was soon repaired, but the party having touched it, was the advance of Forrest's main force, which passed Fayetteville the night following, moving toward Decherd. Having learned, however, that heavier forces were before him than he wished to meet, he changed direction and divided his forces. General Rousseau had moved by rail, the day previous, to Tullahoma, and Gen eral Steedman had crossed the Tennessee river, and was ad vancing north upon the road with five thousand men, and in the face of the two columns, Forrest turned back, sending Bu ford with four thousand men to Huntsville, and moving him self with three thousand toward Columbia. Buford reached Huntsville the night of the 30th, and made an ineffectual de mand for the surrender of the place. Remaining during the night, he repeated his demand with similar issue the next morn ing, and then moved off' toward Athens. Here he made an attack at 3 p. M., and was repulsed by the Seventy-third Indiana, Lieutenant-Colonel Slade commanding, which had been sent thither by General Granger to regarrison the post, immediately after Colonel Campbell's surrender. Buford anticipated an easy victory, but was twice repulsed, and was pursued after with drawal, by a small party of General Granger's cavalry. He crossed the Tennessee, at Brown's ferry, on the 3d of October. General Forrest succeeded no better. He reached Columbia on the 1st, but refrained from attack. He remained in the vi cinity until the 3d, and then moved in the direction of Mount Pleasant, destroying five miles of railroad between Cartersville and Spring Hill. By this time, four columns were converging upon him, under the direction of General Thomas. General Morgan's division having arrived at Huntsville the night of"], [179, "MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. 165 the 1st, moved through Athens to secure the crossing at Bain bridge ; General Rousseau was on his way from Nashville with four thousand men, who had been hastily mounted ; Croxton wasadvancingthroughLawreuceburg,andGeneral\"Washburne, with three thousand infantry and fifteen hundred cavalry, was passing up the Tennessee river, under instructions to leave his infantry at Johnsonville and join General Rousseau at Pulaski, with his cavalry. In addition to these dispositions, Lieutenant- Commander Forrest, commanding the naval force on the Up per Tennessee, was requested to send gunboats to Florence, if the stage of water would permit. This combination might have resulted in Forrest's capture, had not the high water in Elk river detained Morgan, who did not reach Rogersville until the night of the 4th, while Forrest passed through Laurence burg the same night, and crossed at Bainbridge on the 6th, his rear forces having been reached by Washburne's advance. But if Forrest was neither captured nor defeated, the main line of railroad was saved from serious damage, and to break it was doubtless the chief object of his raid. As soon as General Thomas was advised of Hood's north ward march, he made dispositions to offer resistance on the line of the Tennessee river, and especially to defend Chatta nooga and Bridgeport \u2014 the most important points on the direct line of supply. He first directed General Rousseau to destroy all ferry-boats and other means of crossing the river below Decatur, and then take post at Florence, Alabama, and ordered General Morgan to return to Athens. \"When the direction of General Hood's march was clearly indicated, he directed General Croxton, with his brigade of cavalry, to cover the crossings of the river from Decatur to Eastport, and hur ried Morgan's division from Athens to Chattanooga, Steed man's from Decatur to Bridgeport, and Rousseau's from Flor ence to Athens. The garrisons at Decatur, Huntsville, and Stevenson were not reinforced, that there might be she heavi est concentration possible, should the enemy advance toward Chattanooga or Bridgeport. The northward march of Hood's army, on General Sher man's communications, created an intense alarm all over the North, from which the highest military circles were not free."], [180, "166 MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. As a consequence, all available troops in the Department of the Ohio, and all, in fact, far and near, were directed to Gen eral Thomas ; and so threatening was the emergency in the estimation of the lieutenant-general, that he advised the with drawal of all the forces on the railroad \" from Columbia to Decatur, and thence to Stevenson.\" General Thomas, how ever, did not adopt the suggestion, and subsequent events jus tified his action. \"When, on the 13th, General Thomas ascertained that Hood's advance was at Lafayette, Georgia, he directed General Wag ner, in command at Chattanooga, to call in all the detachments from Tuunel Hill, north, and make preparations to hold his important post. Accordingly, a very large number of guns were mounted in the fortificatious, which had been made exceedingly strong by Colonel Merrill, with his engineer regi ment and the forces left as a garrison, while all the outlying troops were concentrated for the defense of the town and sup plies. Upon General Schofield's return from Dalton to Cleveland, General Thomas directed him to assume command at Chat tanooga, and add to the garrison all the troops within reach. But though General Hood was so near, he had no thought of putting his army between the mountains, south of Chatta nooga, at least while General Sherman was in his immediate rear, and soon moved westward to avoid battle and pursue the accomplishment of the ultimate object of his march to the north. As soon as he turned westward, General Thomas sent General Schofield, with Morgan's and Wagnerle divisions, up Will's valley to watch against the approach of the enemy toward Bridgeport, but soon recalled him, having gained knowledge of General Hood's movement upon Gadsden. When General Sherman learned that Hood had turned west ward, he proposed to follow him wherever he might go, but did not believe that he meditated the invasion of Tennessee, though the declarations of the Confederate President and Gen eral Hood gave assurance of this design. The pursuit of Hood was maintained by various routes to Gaylesville, and there General Sherman halted his armies to await the repair of the railroad and the developments of the enemy. He stationed"], [181, "MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. 167 the Army of the Tennessee near Little river, to support the cavalry and observe the enemy toward Will's valley; the Army of the Ohio at Cedar Bluffs, to feel forward to Center and in the direction of Blue Mountain ; and the Army of the Cumberland at Gaylesville. While in this region the armies drew their supplies from the country. Although General Hood had not achieved the grand results which the sanguine President had predicted, he had neverthe less been so far successful as to perplex the national com manders and give hope to the insurgents. He had not forced General Sherman into a disastrous retreat, but he had drawn him to the north, not in abandonment of Atlanta and his forti fied positions, but with nearly all his forces. He had twice thrown his armies between General Sherman and his base ; had maneuvered with skill; had captured the garrisons at Big Shanty, Acworth, Tilton, and Dalton ; had destroyed nearly thirty miles of railroad, and, except in his attack upon Allatoona, had received no harm. He had moved in boldest disregard of railroads and communications, contrary to the precedents of the previous campaign, and, in fine, his north ward march had been brilliantly executed. The resulting problems were freighted with the gravest issues. The insur gents were now too far exhausted to bear the overthrow of his army in its perilous adventure to the north, and yet Hood held boldly to his plan, as though assured of success. A new base, with railroad communications, was in preparation for him in Northern Mississippi, under the direction of General Beauregard, now in supreme command in the West, not for defense, but for aggression of the boldest type, whose expla nation is found in the expectation that the trans-Mississippi forces would swell Hood's army for its resistless sweep through Tennessee and Kentucky. General Canby's dispatch to Gen eral Sherman, dated October 18th, gives evidence of the effort to reinforce Hood's army from the West ; as, without heavy reinforcements, aggression, in the face of General Sherman's armies, was palpably impossible. No doubt the minor object was to decoy General Sherman from the Chatta nooga and Atlanta railroad, and the undoing of the campaign on that line ; but the main one was the invasion of Tennessee"], [182, "168 MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. and Kentucky. Subsequently, General Sherman's movement to the south so changed the situation that this invasion was attempted without the trans-Mississippi forces. While the rebel generals were preparing to invade Ten nessee and Kentucky, General Sherman was engrossed with the project which he first suggested as a contingency when about to make the circuit of Atlanta, in August, and which he had since repeatedly brought to the attention of General Grant. At Atlanta, Allatoona, Kingston, and now, while awaiting, at Gaylesville, the repair of the railroad, he made suggestions to General Grant, from day to day, concerning the \" march to the sea.\" He was unwilling to follow Hood farther west, as in this way, it had been planned that he should be decoyed from Georgia. By the 20th of October his plans for a counter-movement were well matured, and his utterances and orders foreshadowed their early execution. He proposed to leave General Thomas in command of the military division in his absence \u2014 which at first he thought would be ninety days, as in that time he could go to the sea and return \u2014 giving him as an army for defense the Fourth Corps, the garrisons in Ten nessee and Alabama, and the new troops that had been ordered to Nashville. For himself he would retain the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Seventeenth, Twentieth, and Twenty-third Corps, and a cavalry corps of three divisions, comprising twenty-five hundred men each, under the command of Brevet Major-Gen eral J. H. Wilson, recently sent by General Grant to be chief of the cavalry of the military division. These troops were to be trimmed to perfect efficiency. The railroad was to be re paired to Atlanta, for use in preparation for the march beyond, and then to be destroyed. Telegraphic communication between Chattanooga and At lanta was established October 20th, and on the 28th the rail road was in running order. In the meantime General Hood assumed the offensive. Advancing from Gadsden, he appeared before Decatur on the 26th and made an attack, but not with such force as indicated a purpose to storm the place \u2014 his three corps of infantry being near, and his cavalry being dis posed on the south bank of the river, from Guntersville to Eastport. General Thomas sent two regiments to General"], [183, "MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. 169 Granger, from Chattanooga, and instructed him to hold his post at all hazards. This was a feeble reinforcement, but he had no other spare troops to throw before the enemy. The divisions of Morgan and Wagner had been recalled from Ten nessee by General Sherman, and for the defense of the line of the Tennessee river there were the usual garrisons, and Gen eral Croxton's brigade of cavalry spread out on the north bank. In the emergency General Sherman ordered General Stanley to report with his corps to General Thomas, and, by order, placed the latter in command of all troops and garrisons in his military division, not in his own presence, contingent upon his separation from his division \" by military movements or the accidents of war.\" On the 27th, General Hood intrenched his position before Decatur, skirmished during the day, but used no artillery, though he put guns in position. Under the cover of darkness, he drove in General Granger's pickets with a strong force, and established a new line within five hundred yards of the town. The next day, General Granger made a successful sortie. His troops advanced, under cover of the guns of the fort, down the river bank and round to the rear of the enemy's rifle-pits, and by a bold charge cleared them, killing a large number of men and capturing one hundred and twenty. A battery above the town was also captured by the Fourteenth United States Colored troops, Colonel T. J. Morgan commanding, but the position being too much exposed to be held, the guns were spiked and the regiment under orders retired to the fort. In the charge, Colonel Morgan lost forty men killed and wounded, including three officers killed. This resistance to the estab lishment of his investing lines, and his lack of provisions, in duced General Hood to withdraw his forces altogether at 4 A. M. on the 29th. He could neutralize the place by passing to the west aud meet his supplies, while he could secure crossings at less cost down the river ; and these considerations doubtless induced his withdrawal. He lost several hundred, perhaps more than a thousand men, while inflicting a loss of eighty, and kept his troops in action in almost utter destitution of provisions. General Hood has not reported his objects in the various"], [184, "170 MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. movements of his campaign, and hence his purpose in oper ating against Decatur has not been authentically revealed. All circumstances, except his own statement of his plan, lead to the belief that he expected to cross the Tennessee river at Decatur and move rapidly upon General Sherman's communi cations in Middle Tennessee, and cut off\" his supplies entirely. The press in the South, and his own officers, entertained and expressed the opinion that this extreme aggression was medi tated. The opposition of General Granger's small force at Decatur was so positive, even showing the purpose of offense, that he was deterred from the effort to carry the position by assault. There was a diversity of opinion among his gen eral officers as to the wisdom of his withdrawal from Decatur, as it involved the abandonment, for a time, of his advance to Nashville. During the 29th, General Croxton discovered that the enemy was crossing the Tennessee river at the mouth of Cypress creek, two miles below Florence. He concentrated his forces as far as practicable, but was unable to regain the north bank. Having been informed of this turn of affairs, General Thomas directed General Hatch, at Clifton, commanding a cavalry division of General Howard's army, and under orders to join General Sherman in Georgia, when ready for the field, to move to General Croxton's support, and urged both commanders to keep the enemy from crossing other forces, if possible, until the Fourth Corps could arrive from Georgia and get into posi tion to meet him. It was, however, too late to defend the line of the Tennessee river, as Hood was master of too many crossings ; and when General Wood's division, the advance of the corps, arrived at Athens, on the 31st, General Thomas ordered General Stanley to unite his command at Pulaski and await further instructions. The same day, General Schofield was ordered to move from Resaca, Georgia, to Columbia, Ten nessee, to combine with General Stanley and the cavalry to resist the advance of the enemy into Middle Tennessee. That an invasion was meditated had become evident from Southern newspapers, and prisoners and deserters from Hood's army bore testimony to this purpose. The conjecture that he could not supply his army on the Tennessee or north of it was now"], [185, "171 MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. plainly groundless, as he had established communications by the repair of the Ohio and Mobile railroad, and supplies were coming to him from Selma and Montgomery, through Corinth, and thence eastward to Cherokee Station, on the Memphis and Charleston railroad. And while he had thrust the heads of infantry columns over the river at Florence and at points above and below, he had sent Forrest with his bold troopers up the Tennessee river to break up General Thomas' line of supply by the river and the Northwestern railroad. Forrest appeared at Fort Heiman, an earthwork on the west bank of the Tennessee, about seventy-five miles from Padu- cah, where, three days later, he captured gunboat No. 55, and two transports, having previously burned the steamer Em- press. On the 2d of November, he planted his batteries above and below Johnsonville, the western terminus of the North- western railroad, and an important depot of supplies. His guns blockaded the river, and shut in before the town three gunboats, eight transports, and about a dozen barges. The garrison comprised a thousand men from the Forty-third Wisconsin and the Twelfth United States Colored regiment, and a detachment of the Eleventh Tennessee cavalry, under the command of Colonel C. R. Thompson, of the Twelfth Col- ored regiment. The naval forces, under Lieutenant E. M. King, attacked the enemy's guns below the town, but though repulsed after a severe conflict, they recaptured a transport having on board two 20-pounder Parrott guns and quarter- master's stores, and forced Forrest to burn the gunboat cap- tured on the 31st of October. On the 4th, the enemy opened fire upon the gunboats from the opposite bank. The guns on boats and land responded briskly, but were soon disabled, and for fear that they would fall into the hands of the enemy, both gunboats and transports were fired. The flames reached the stores on the levee, and property worth a million of dollars was consumed. It was fear rather than necessity that caused this waste, as Forrest withdrew soon after altogether, having delivered a furious cannonade. He crossed the river above the town, by means of extemporized flat-boats, and moved to ward Clifton, with evident design of co-operating with the main army."], [186, "172 MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. On the evening of the 5th, General Schofield reached John sonville with a portion of his command, having moved rapidly by rail, in compliance with instructions from General Thomas to save the gunboats and supplies. Having left a sufficient force to defend the place, he then proceeded to join General Stanley at Pulaski, to assume command of the forces before the enemy. He was assigned to this position, by reason of his rank as a department commander, though General Stanley was his senior as a major-general. General Hood was now free to invade Tennessee, as the low stage of water in the river prevented the effective use of the gunboats against his pontoon bridges, and General Thomas could not offer a strong army on the north bank. He was also free to move to the southwest should General Sherman concentrate his armies against him ; but General Sherman was unwilling to do this. His preparations for his march through Georgia were nearly completed, and he was unwilling to take a step backward, to pursue Hood. He made provis ion, however, for reinforcing General Thomas, by calling two divisions, under General A. J. Smith, from Missouri, and by sending back General Wilson, and the cavalry of McCook's and Garrard's divisions to give a good remount to Kilpatrick's division, retained by himself. General Hood's threatening attitude called forth a fresh discussion of General Sherman's projected march between him and General Grant, but induced no change of plan. The conclusions reached were these, that turning back would undo the work of the preceding campaign, give up the territory which had been gained, and fulfill the predictions of Mr. Davis with regard to the effect of Hood's advance to the North, and that he could not be overtaken if followed ; and on the other hand, going forward would destroy the railroads of Georgia, inflict immense damage, and produce a most potent moral effect, in illustrating the vulnerability of the South. In his last communication to General Grant, General Sherman said : \" If we can march a well-appointed army right through this territory, it is a demonstration to the world \u2014 foreign and do mestic \u2014 that we have a power which Davis can not resist. This may not be war, but rather statesmanship. Nevertheless"], [187, "173 MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. it is overwhelming to my mind, that there are thousands of people abroad and in the South who will reason thus : If the North can march an army right through the South, it is proof positive that the North can prevail in this contest, leaving only its willingness to use that power.\" This moral effect was, indeed, the justification of the movement, as General Sherman proposed to use the territory which he had gained in Georgia as a track simply for his march, and not hold any part of Georgia except his objective on the Atlantic shore, while he left behind him one of the two great armies upon which the existence of the rebellion depended. It is true, however, that even in his last dispatches before starting, he expressed the conviction that Beauregard and Hood would be forced by public clamor to follow him. He retained for himself from his three armies the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and Twentieth Corps, and one large division of cavalry, in all sixty thousand infantry, and five thousand five hundred cav alry, and one piece of artillery to every thousand men. City Point, Va., September 10, 1864. Major-General Sherman : As soon as your men are properly rested and preparations can be made, it is desirable that another campaign should be commenced. We want to keep the enemy continually pressed to the end of the war. If we give him no peace while the war lasts, the end can not be far dis tant. Now that we have all of Mobile Bay that is valuable, I do not know but it will be the best move for Major-General Canby's troops to act upon Savannah, while you move on Augusta. I should like to hear from you on this matter. U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant- General. Headquarters Department of the Cumberland, Atlanta, Ga., September 14, 1864. Brigadier-General B. S. Granger, Decatur : General Sherman informs me that General Smith has been directed to Missouri by orders from Major-General Halleck; also, that he has official information that Forrest and his command reached Mobile on the 8th instant. You must therefore apprehend no trouble from any but Roddy, Wheeler, and the parties which have already been in Tennessee. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding."], [188, "174 MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, Atlanta, Ga., October 1, 1864. Lieutenant-General U. S. Grant, City Point : Hood is evidently on the west side of Chattahoochee, below Sweet water. If he tries to get on my road this side of the Etowah, I shall at tack him ; but if he goes on to the Selma and Talladega road, why would it not do for me to leave Tennessee to the forces which Thomas has and the reserves soon to come to Nashville, and for me to destroy Atlanta, and then march across Georgia to Savannah or Charleston, breaking roads and doing irreparable damage ? We can not remain on the defensive. W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General. Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, Atlanta, Ga., October 1, 1864 \u2014 2 p. m. General G. H. Thomas, Chattanooga : I have your dispatch of noon. Use your own discretion as to matters north of the Tennessee river. If I can induce Hood to swing across to Blue Mountain, I shall feel tempted to start for Milledgeville, Millen, and Savannah or Charleston, absolutely destroying all Georgia, and taking either Savannah or Charleston. In that event, I would order back to Chattanooga everything the other side of Kingston, and bring forward all else ; destroy Atlanta and the bridge, and absolutely scour the Southern Confederacy. In that event, Hood would be puzzled and would follow me ; or if he entered Tennessee he could make no permanent stay. But if he attempts the road this side of Kingston or Rome, I will turn against him. Forrest will not attack our forts \u2014 that is manifest; but will try and get possession of Decatur. All the infantry and cavalry not in forts or blockhouses should be directed against him by roads \u2014 say the Shelbyville pike and Fayetteville. W. T. SHERMAN, Major- General.

V. Should the enemy attempt our road about Kingston or to invest Rome, the army must be prepared to leave at Allatoona the principal wagon trains, and to march rapidly to the points threatened ; but if the enemy simply moves off toward Jacksonville or Blue Mountain, the army will remain, its right at Alatoona and left at Kenesaw, until our roads are repaired. By order of Major-General W. T. Sherman. L. M. DAYTON, Aid-de-Camp. Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, Allatoona, Ga., October 9, 1864. Lieutenant-General Grant, City Point, Va. : It will be a physical impossibility to protect the roads, now that Hood, Forrest, Wheeler, and the whole batch of devils are turned loose without home or habitation I think Hood's movements indicate a diversion to the end of the Selma and Talladega railroad at Blue Mountain, about sixty (60) miles southwest of Rome, from which he will threaten King ston, Bridgeport, and Decatur, Alabama. I propose that we break up the railroad from Chattanooga, and strike out with wagons for Milledgeville and Savannah. Until we can repopu late Georgia, it is useless to occupy it; but the utter destruction of its roads, houses, and people will cripple their military resources. By at tempting to hold the roads, we will lose a thousand men monthly, and will gain no result. I can make the march and make Georgia howl. We have over eight thousand (8,000) cattle and three million rations of bread, but no corn ; but we can forage in the interior of the state. W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General Commanding. Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, Carterville, October 10, 1864. General Grant, City Point : Dispatch about Wilson received. Hood is now crossing Coosa, twelve (12) miles below Rome, bound west. If he passes over to the Mobile and Ohio road, had I not better execute the plan of my letter sent by Colonel Porter, and leave General Thomas with the troops now in Tennessee, to defend the state ?

We can maintain our men and animals on the country. W. T. SHERMAN, Major- General. Atlanta, October 17, 1864. Major-General Sherman : I have a Montgomery paper of the 12th. The dispatches from Hood, \u00ab,s well as the editorials, state that Beauregard is with Hood, and that the army is going to cross the Tennessee river. H. W. SLOCUM, Major- General. Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, Ship's Gap, Ga., October 17, 1864. General Thomas, Nashville: Hood won't dare go into Tennessee. I hope he will. We now occupy Ship's Gap and Lafayette, and Hood is retreating toward Alpine and Gadsden. I am moving General Garrard to-day to Dirttown, and will move General Corse out to Coosaville, and with the main army move on Summerville. If Hood wants to go into Tennessee, west of Huntsville, let him go, and then we can all turn on him and he can not escape. The gunboats can break any bridge he may attempt above Decatur. If he attempts to cross, let him do so in part, and then let a gunboat break through his bridge. I will follow him to Gadsden, and then want my whole army united for the grand move into Georgia. W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General. New Orleans, October 18, 1864. Major-General Sherman : I learn by an intercepted dispatch from Jeff. Davis to Kirby Smith, dated at Montgomery on the 30th, that the orders to cross the Mississippi had been received. I presume that duplicate of this dispatch has reached Kirby Smith, as Magruder's force, about eighteen or twenty thousand (18,000 or 20,000) men, suddenly left General Steele's front and moved in the diroction of the Washita river. I have sent a fast boat to commu-"], [194, "180 MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. nicate this intelligence to the troops and gunboats on the river, and as I have now about eight thousand (8,000) troops afloat, and will at once increase the number, I think the crossing can be prevented. The cross ing will probably be attempted in the neighborhood of Gaines' Landing. ED. R. S. CANBY, Major-General. Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, Summerville, Ga., October 19, 1864 \u2014 12 m. Major-General Halleck, Washington, D. C. : Hood has retreated rapidly by all the roads leading south. Our ad vance columns are now at Alpine and Melville Post-office. I shall pursue him as far as Gaylesville. The enemy will not venture toward Tennessee, except around by Decatur. I propose to send the Fourth Corps back to General Thomas, and leave him that corps, the garrisons and new troops, to defend the line of the Tennessee, and with the rest to push into the heart of Georgia, and come out at Savannah, destroying all the railroads of the state. The break at Big Shanty is repaired, and that about Dalton should be in ten (10) days. We find abundance of forage in the country. W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General Commanding. Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, Summerville, Ga., October 19, 1864. General G. H. Thomas, Nashville, Tenn. : Make a report to me as soon as possible of what troops you now have in Tennessee, what are expected, and how disposed. I propose, with the Armies of the Tennessee, the Ohio, and two corps of yours, to sally forth and make a hole in Georgia and Alabama that will be hard to mend. Hood has little or no baggage, and will escape me. He can not invade Tennessee, except to the west of Huntsville. I want the gunboats and what troops are on the Tennessee to be most active up at the head of navigation. I want General Wilson and General Mower with me, and would like General McCook's division made up to twenty-five hundred (2,500) men mounted. I will send back into Tennessee the Fourth Corps, all dismounted cavalry, all sick and wounded, and all incum brances whatever, except what I can haul in our wagons, and will prob ably, about November 1st, break up the railroad and bridges, destroy At lanta, and make a break for Mobile, Savannah, or Charleston. I want you to remain in Tennessee, and take command of all my division not actually present with me. Hood's army may be set down at forty thousand (40,000) of all arms fit for duty ; he may follow me or turn against you. If you can defend the line of the Tennessee in my absence of three (3) months, is all I ask. W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General."], [195, "181 MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC.

If it turns up at Guntersville, I will be after it; but if it goes, as I believe, to Decatur and beyond, I must leave it to you at present, and push for the heart of Georgia. All I want is to get my sick and wounded back to a safe place. I start the Fourth Corps back to-morrow, via Muston's and Valley Head, ordering it to Bridgeport or Chattanooga, according to what -orders Stanley may have from you. Stanley will have about fifteen thousand (15,000) men. Beaureguard may attempt Tennesse from the di rection of Muscle Shoals, but when he finds me pushing for Macon, Mil ledgeville, etc., he will turn back.

Stanley's troops are now arriving at Pulaski. I hope they will all be there at 12 m. to-morrow. I have halted General Hatch at Pulaski, and he is co-operating with General Croxton against the enemy. If I had General Schofield, should feel perfectly easy. I have given such instructions as ought to expedite his arrival. It will be necessary to hold the usual guards on the railroad until the troops can pass over. I will give instructions to have them con centrated as soon as the troops have passed.

If I were to let go Atlanta and North Georgia, and make for Hood, he would, as he did here, retreat to the southwest, leaving his militia, now assembling at Macon and Griffin, to occupy our conquests, and the work of last summer would be lost. I have retained about fifty thousand (50,000) good troops, and have sent back full twenty five thousand (25,000), and have instructed General Thomas to hold de fensively Nashville, Chattanooga, and Decatur, all fortified and provis ioned for a long siege. I will destroy all the railroads of Georgia, and do as much substantial damage as is possible, reaching the seacoast near one of the points hitherto indicated, trusting that Thomas, with his present troops, and the influx of new regiments promised, will be able in a few days to assume the offensive. Hood's cavalry may do a good deal of damage, and I have sent Wilson back with all dismounted cavalry, retaining only about four thousand five hundred (4,500). This is the best I can do, and shall, therefore, when I get to Atlanta the necessary stores, move south as soon as pos sible. W. T. SHERMAN, Major- General. City Point, November 1, 1864 \u2014 6 p. m. Major-General Sherman : Do you not think it advisable, now that Hood has gone so far north, to entirely ruin him before starting on your proposed campaign ? With Hood's army destroyed, you can go where you please with impunity. I believed, and still believe, if you had started south while Hood was in the neighborhood of you, he would have been forced to go after you. Now that he is so far away, he might look upon the chase as useless, and he will go in one direction while you are pushing the other. If you can see the chance for destroying Hood's army, attend to that first, and make your other move secondary. U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

All right. I can hardly believe Beau regard would attempt to work against Nashville, from Corinth as a base, at this stage of the war, but all information seems to point that way. If he does, you will whip him out of his boots ; but I rather think you will find commotion in his camp in a day or two. Last night we burned Rome, and in two more will burn Atlanta, and he must discover that I am not retreating, but, on the contrary, fighting for the very heart of Georgia. About a division of rebel cavalry made its appearance this morning south of the Coosa river, opposite Rome, and fired on the rear guard, as it withdrew. Also, two days ago, some of Iverson's cavalry \u2014 about eight hundred (800) \u2014 approached Atlanta from the direction of De catur, with a section of guns, and swept round toward Whitehall, and disappeared in the direction of Rough and Ready. These also seem to"], [199, "MARCH TO THE NORTH, ETC. 185 indicate that Beauregard expected us to retreat. I hear of about fifteen hundred (1,500) infantry down at Carrollton, and also some infantry at Jonesboro, but what numbers I can not estimate. These are all the en emy I know to be in this neighborhood, though a rumor is that Breckin ridge has arrived with some from West Virginia. To-morrow I begin the movement laid down in my Special Field Order No. 1 15, and shall keep things moving thereafter. By to-morrow morning all trains will be at or north of Kingston, and you can have the exclusive use of all the rolling stock. By using detachments of recruits and dismounted cavalry in your fortifications, you will have Schofield and Stanley and A. J. Smith, strengthened by eight or ten new regiments and all of Wilson's cavalry. You can safely invite Beauregard across the Tennessee, and prevent his ever returning. I still believe, however, that the public clamor will force him to turn, and follow me ; in which event, you should cross at Decatur, and move directly toward Selma, as far as you can transport supplies. The probabilities are the wires will be broken to-morrow, and that all communication will cease between us ; but I have directed the main wire to be left, and will use it if possible, and wish you to do the same. You may act, however, on the certainty that I sally from Atlanta on the 16th, with about sixty thousand (60,000) men, well provisioned, but expecting to live liberally on the country. W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General."], [200, "186 CHAPTER XXXIV. THE RESISTANCE TO GENERAL HOOD'S ADVANCE FROM THE TEN- NESSEE RIVER, CULMINATING IN THE BATTLE OF FRANKLIN. The responsibility of repelling General Hood was now thrown upon General Thomas, and the most stupendous in terests turned upon his success. Not in figure, but in fact, the territory gained by all the battles in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Georgia was in jeopardy. The peril was not such as is in evitable when two equal armies meet in battle, but such as is intertwined with the contingencies of improvising an army against a bold invasion. It is true that General Thomas ex pressed himself hopefully in his last dispatch to General Sher man, but his assurance was based upon the fact that General Smith's forces were then clue at Nashville, and the expectation that his cavalry would be speedily remounted, and that the coming of the promised reinforcements from the North would not be delayed. In these expectations he was disappointed, and the situation in Tennessee was most unpromising during the month of November. General Hood's army wras stronger than when, under General Johnston, in May, it boldly con fronted a hundred thousand men. His three corps of infantry, under Generals Lee, Cheatham, and Stewart, comprised from forty to forty -five thousand men, and his cavalry corps from ten to fifteen thousand, under Forrest, one of the boldest gen erals in the South. Against this compact army, at least fifty thousand strong, General Thomas had a movable army of twenty-two thousand infantry and four thousand three hun dred cavalry. He had, in addition, the garrisons at Chatta nooga, Bridgeport, Stevenson, Huntsville, Decatur, Murfrees boro, and Nashville, and the detachments in block-houses"], [201, "BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETO. 187 on the railroads ; but it was not considered safe to withdraw the troops from either of the two railroads leading from. Nash ville to the Tennessee river, until General Hood should indi cate his line of advance. General Hood, with the exception of Forrest's raid in \"West Tennessee, confined himself to oper ations near Florence, during the first half of the month. His main reason for clinging to the Tennessee river was doubtless the uncertain attitude of General Sherman in Georgia. He may have still hoped that reinforcements from the other side of the Mississippi might join him as previously anticipated. But though refraining from positive offense, he was preparing for it. His forces which crossed the Tennessee river on the 29th of October, drove back General Croxton and covered the laying of a pontoon bridge. Lee's corps soon after crossed and intrenched, having cavalry in front. November 4th, General Croxton was driven across Shoal creek, but the enemy ad vanced no farther. General Hatch, with his division of cav alry, joined General Croxton on the line of Shoal creek on the 7th, and these officers then watched closely and reported the movements of the enemy. Wishing to ascertain the ene my's strength in his front, General Hatch crossed the creek on the 11th, and drove back the enemy's cavalry upon the in fantry, and ascertained that there was a large force on the Waynesboro road. The next day telegraphic communication between General Sherman and General Thomas was severed ; and as soon as it was thus known that General Sherman had started on his great expedition, there was the most anxious watching in Hood's front, in the endeavor to ascertain how the \" march to the sea \" would affect the situation in Tennes see. The alternative to General Thomas and his little army was the defensive in Tennessee, or the offensive in Alabama, accordingly as Hood should advance or retreat, and all were eager for the development of his intentions. Generals Hatch and Croxton watched closely for decisive indications, and although the high stage of water in the Tennessee delayed a general advance, it was soon evident that such a movement was meditated. To delay Hood's advance as much as pos sible, General Hatch obstructed the roads crossing Shoal creek, and sent rafts down the swollen river to break his"], [202, "188 BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. bridges. Eeports were current, subsequently, that his bridges did part, and from this or other causes, he did not complete the transfer of his army to the north bank until the 19th, when his movement was completely developed. Colonel Coon, commanding General Hatch's right brigade, crossed Shoal creek, which still separated the opposing cavalry, had a severe conflict, and did not return until he had discovered the advancing infantry. The possibility of General Hood fol lowing General Sherman was now at an end. Up to this time General Thomas had hoped that the enemy would be so delayed, that he could concentrate his forces to give battle south of Duck river, but this was now plainly im possible. General Smith had not arrived, new regiments had not come as fast as old ones had been discharged upon expira tion of terms of service, and the dismounted cavalry had made but little headway in securing horses, arms, and accouterments. His only resource then was to retire slowly, and delay the enemy's advance, to gain time for reinforcements to arrive and concentrate. It was hoped that the state of the roads would prevent the advance of infantry, but Hood appreciated the effect of delay, and pressed forward. He advanced on the 19th, on the Waynesboro and Butter Creek roads, with his cavalry mainly on his left. The direction of his advance indi cated that he would strike Columbia, rather than Pulaski, and General Thomas authorized General Schofield to move to the former place, if Hood's approach to that point should be developed. General Hatch concentrated his division at Lex ington, and on the 21st, withdrew to Lawrenceburg, where he was attacked the following morning. A severe fight continued through the day, but General Hatch held the position against a heavy force of cavalry, with nine pieces of artillery in action. The same day, General Schofield commenced the removal of the public property from Pulaski, preparatory to falling back to Columbia, and moved with the divisions of Generals Cox and Wagner to Lynnville, the latter covering the passage of the trains. The next day General Cox advanced ten miles toward Columbia, and General Stanley , with the divisions of Generals Wood and Kimball, reached Lynnville. Colonel Capron was before the enemy on the Mount Pleasant"], [203, "BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. 189 road, and Generals Hatch and Croxton covered the movement from Pulaski, the latter having a severe fight at the junction of the roads to Pulaski and Campbellsville, maintaining his po sition and retiring at leisure by night to Campbellsville. In the meantime, General Thomas made dispositions looking to the defense of the line of Duck river, and the Nashville and Chattanooga railroad. He ordered the two brigades of Gen eral Ruger's division of the Twenty-third Corps to move from Johnsonville \u2014 one by rail through Nashville to Columbia, and the other by road through Waverly \u2014 to occupy the crossings of Duck river at Williamsport, Gordon's ferry, and Centerville. General Granger was instructed to withdraw his command from Decatur, Athens, and Huntsville, and reinforce the garrisons of Stevenson and Murfreesboro, to protect the Nashville and Chattanooga railroad. He sent Colonel Von Schrader, his inspector-general, to Chattanooga to assist in the organization of the detached troops belonging to General Sherman's army, and another officer \u2014 Lieutenant M. J. Kelley \u2014 to Paducah, to hasten the coming of General Smith. His engineers were busy with the construction of fortifications at various points, espe cially at Nashville, while effort was made to provide pontoon trains in room of those which had gone to Savannah. General Hood's rapid advance from Florence had been made with the hope of cutting off General Schofield from Columbia, and barely failed in this object, as the national troops gained the place by a night march. General Stanley, having been ir - formed after midnight that Colonel Capron had been driven from Mount Pleasant by an infantry force, roused his corps and hastened toward Columbia, twenty-one miles distant. Gen eral Cox started at the same hour, and reached Columbia in time to save Capron from defeat and the town from capture. When within three miles of Columbia, General Cox crossed to the Mount Pleasant road and intercepted the enemy's forces, which were pressing Capron back upon the town. As the di visions of the Fourth Corps arrived, they formed in line of bat tle south of Duck river and intrenched. General Hatch was attacked at Campbellsville by cavalry supported by infantry. Colonel Wells, commanding first brigade, at first repulsed the enemy, but subsequently the whole command was compelled"], [204, "190 BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. to retire to Lynnville ; there the fighting was continued until after dark, when General Hatch withdrew to Columbia. With a view to check the enemy and hold the place, heavy works were thrown up before Columbia, and the cavalry, Gen eral Wilson commanding in person, was disposed to watch against turning movements up and down the river. Hatch's division and Croxton's brigade were stationed on the Shelby - ville road, six miles east of Columbia, and Capron's brigade at Rally Hill, on the Lewisburg turnpike. Colonel Stewart, with three regiments from Hatch's division, was sent to the right to the fords between Columbia and Williamsport ; Capron's bri gade, and the Eighth Iowa and Seventh Ohio Cavalry regiments were here formed into a provisional division under command of General R. W. Johnson. During the 24th and 25th, the enemy skirmished before Co lumbia, but showed nothing but dismounted cavalry, until the 26th, when his infantry appeared, and during that day and the next he pressed the lines, but made no assault. General Scho field constructed an interior line of works, but these were soon regarded as untenable, as the enemy manifested an intention to pass round the position. An effort was made to cross to the north bank the night of the 26th, but failed on account of a severe storm and entire darkness. The night following, the movement was accomplished, and General Schofield left Gen eral Ruger to hold the crossing at the railroad bridge ; placed General Cox's division before the town, and directed General Stanley to station his corps on the Franklin turnpike, in read iness to meet the enemy should he attempt to cross near Co lumbia. These dispositions were made by General Schofield in hope that he could hold the line of Duck river, until reinforcements should arrive ; but the promised reinforce ments had not reached Nashville. General Thomas had re ceived twelve thousand raw troops, and had sent North, either on final discharge or to vote, fifteen thousand veterans. General Smith had not come, and only one thousand cavalry had found horses and the front. General Thomas had ob tained permission to call upon the governors of the Western States for troops, but was cautioned to use such troops spar ingly."], [205, "BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. 191 The 28th was passed in quietness, at Columbia, though there were palpable indications that quietness there meant ac tivity in another quarter. At noon the enemy's cavalry ap peared at various fords, between Columbia and the Lewisburg turnpike, in such force as to indicate plainly the purpose to cross. General Hood's cavalry was especially massed at Huey's Mills, eight miles above Columbia, and having there driven in General Wilson's pickets, began to pass over the river. At 2.10 p. M. General Wilson notified General Scho field of the enemy's movements, and informed him that he would concentrate his cavalry at Hunt's creek, on the Lewis burg turnpike, expressing the belief that the enemy would swing in between them and strike the road to Franklin, at Spring Hill. General Wilson's cavalry detachments, at the various fords, held their respective positions as long as possible, but all were finally driven back, and it was then evident that three divisions of cavalry \u2014 Chalmers', Bufo.rd's, and Jackson's \u2014 had crossed Duck river. By 7 p. m. General Wilson had concentrated his command, as far as practicable, at Hart's Cross-roads. Major Young, of the Fifth Iowa Cavalry, commanding detachments, was intercepted, but cut his way through the enemy's lines with trifling loss. During the night \"General Wilson ascer tained that General Forrest was moving toward Franklin, and also that General Hood's infantry forces were expected to cross before morning. In view of the palpable peril, he ad vised General Schofield to withdraw to Franklin, and sug gested that his command should be at Spring Hill by 10 A. M. the next day. When General Thomas was informed of the probable state of things at Columbia, he directed General Schofield to withdraw to Franklin, as soon as he should gain certain knowledge of the reported movements of the enemy. And very soon afterward, at 3.30 a. m. on the 29th, he directed him to withdraw from Columbia, as by this time he was con vinced that General Hood had turned General Schofield's position. The situation at Columbia on the morning of the 29th, and during that day, was exceedingly critical. General Hood's infantry forces were crossing the river during all the early"], [206, "192 BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. hours, at Huey's Mills, on a road leading directly to Spring Hill ; his cavalry forces had very early cut off all communica tion between Generals Schofield and Wilson, and were press ing the latter back upon Franklin, on the Lewisburg turn pike, General Wilson having chosen this line of retreat as the one upon which he could best resist General Forrest, and cover the retirement of the infantry on the direct road from Columbia to Franklin. To develop the facts fully, before withdrawing altogether from Columbia, General Schofield directed General Wood to send a brigade up the river to watch the enemy ; ordered Gen eral Stanley to move with two of his divisions to Spring Hill, to hold that point and cover the trains and spare artillery ; left General Cox to guard the crossing at Columbia, and ordered Ruger's division to take position on the turnpike, in rear of Rutherford's creek, leaving one regiment to hold the ford at Columbia, near the railroad bridge \u2014 this bridge having been partially destroyed and all the others entirely. General Wood sent Post's brigade early, to reconnoiter up the river; and at 8 a. m. General Stanley moved toward Spring Hill with Wagner's and Kimball's divisions. Before reaching Rutherford's creek, four miles distant, he learned that the enemy was crossing infantry and trains above Colum bia, and was moving to the north on a converging road which touched General Schofield's line of retreat at Spring Hill. Apprehending that the forces that Colonel Post reported to be crossing the river might make a flank attack upon the troops between Duck river and Rutherford's creek, he halted Kim ball's division and formed it facing east, and then proceeded to Spring Hill with Wagner's division. When within two miles of the place, at 11.30 a. m., he was informed that the enemy's cavalry was approaching from the direction of Rally Hill. The noise of firing east of the village immediately called the division to rapid motion, and the town was gained in time to meet the enemy, who was driving back a small force of national toops, composed of infantry and cavalry. Colonel Opdycke immediately deployed his brigade and drove back the enemy's cavalry, when General Stanley threw forward the division to hold the town and protect the trains. Opdycke's"], [207, "193 BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. and Lane's brigades were deployed to cover such space as served to park the wagons, and Bradley's was advanced to hold a wooded knoll nearly a mile to the east, which com manded the approaches from that direction. At the time these dispositions were made, it was not known that heavy forces of infantry were near ; but this fact was soon after developed by a fierce assault upon General Bradley. The nature of the attack, confirming the first reports of the ad vance of the Confederate army to the cast of Columbia, gave demonstration of the greatest peril, not only to General Stan ley, but to the four divisions behind him. General Hood's columns had now passed General Schofield's left flank, and were enveloping a single division, twelve miles in his rear, or twelve miles in advance, when he should face to the north to retreat. When the enemy's infantry attacked General Bradley from the east, his cavalry on the west of the town threatened the railroad station, and then fell upon a small train, composed of some baggage-wagons, at Thompson's Station, three miles north. About the same time, General Stanley received a dispatch from General Schofield, confirming the reports that had first indicated the strategy of General Hood, and led him to fear that a heavy force was enveloping his position. He could not therefore reinforce General Bradley, lest he should thereby expose his trains to capture or destruction. General Bradley repulsed two fierce attacks, but in the third his right flank was overlapped by the enemy's line, and he was compelled to fall back to the town, where his shattered bri gade was rallied and reformed. The enemy followed, but fell under the fire of eight pieces of artillery, at good range for spherical case shot, and was also taken in flank by a section on the turnpike, south of the town. A portion of the attack ing troops then fled to the rear, and other portions sought cover in a ravine between the opposing lines. General Stan ley reported Bradley's loss at one hundred and fifty men killed and wounded, and the enemy's at five hundred. General Bradley received a severe wound while encouraging his men vol. n \u2014 13"], [208, "194 BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. to resist the last attack, and the command of the brigade passed to Colonel Conrad. As darkness fell, the enemy's lines were extended until a corps of infantry was in order of battle facing the Franklin road. Two other corps were near a little later, one deployed also, and Forrest's troopers were on the main road, both north and south of Spring Hill. It seemed hardly possible in this post ure of affairs that General Schofield's forces and trains could elude this involution by General Hood's army, and yet this result was achieved without a serious contest. During the day, the enemy covered his movement past General Schofield's left to his rear by earnest efforts, as Gen eral Schofield believed, to force a crossing and lay a pontoon bridge at Columbia, that he might thus secure a passage for his artillery, which was impracticable at Huey's Mills. His repeated attacks were all repulsed by General Cox, and at 3 p. m. General Schofield became satisfied that the enemy would not attack on Duck river, but was moving two corps directly to Spring Hill. He then gave orders for the withdrawal of all the troops when darkness would cover the movement, and with General Ruger's division hastened forward to open com munications with General Stanley. At dark, he brushed away the enemy's cavalry from the road, three miles south of Stan ley, and joined him at 7 p. m. Whittaker's brigade of Kim ball's division followed Ruger's closely from Rutherford's creek, and upon arrival was posted parallel to the turnpike, where the enemy's left rested within eight hundred yards of the road, to cover the passage of the troops still in the rear. General Schofield, leaving the management of the march and the safety of the trains to General Stanley, then moved again with Ruger's division to clear the road to Franklin. As he approached Thompson's Station, the enemy's cavalry disap peared, and then the road was open from Columbia to Frank lin, though an army of at least fifty thousand men was in closest proximity to it, and along its front four divisions and an immense train were at rest or in motion, and yet there was only slight skirmishing here and there, and occasional picket firing. There was momentary expectation that this great army would take a step forward, and press troops, artillery, and"], [209, "BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. 195 trains from the road in confusion and rout; but still the move ment went on without interruption by the enemy. Having cleared the road at Thompson's Station, General Schofield returned to Spring Hill to make arrangements and dispositions to avert his extreme peril. He did not anticipate the possibility of his getting his army out of the reach of the enemy that night, and feared that he would be forced to fight a general battle the next day, or lose his wagon train. In the emergency he had dispatched a staff officer to Franklin to bring forward the command of General A. J. Smith, which he supposed had reached Franklin. At 11 p. m. General Thomas, believing that General Scho field had, in obedience to his order of 3.30 a. m., withdrawn from Columbia earlier in the day, telegraphed to him at Frank lin to withdraw from that place also, should the enemy attempt to get on his flank with infantry. As General Smith's troops had not yet arrived at Nashville, he considered it necessary, should the enemy advance quickly upon General Schofield, to concentrate his forces at Nashville. General Cox left Columbia at 7 p. m., followed by General Wood, and the latter by General Kimball. There was some delay at Rutherford's creek, as the bridge was inadequate for the emergency, but nevertheless the divisions, one after an other, arrived at Spring Hill \u2014 the foremost of the three at 11 p. M. The enemy's pickets fired into the column frequently, but when they did not come upon the road, the national troops gave no response. The enemy was so close to the road, that when a column was not moving upon it, it was difficult for a single horseman to pass. The danger did not end with the arrival of the last division at Spring Hill. It was 1 a. m. before a train of eight hundred wagons, including artillery and ambulances, could move to ward Franklin, in rear of Cox's division, as at starting the wagons had to pass singly over a bridge. This caused delay, and consequently peril, as an attack was inevitable, unless the train and troops could be put on the road and in motion be fore daylight. General Stanley was advised to burn at least a portion of the wagons, to avoid an attack, but he determined to save all, if practicable. At 3 a. m. an attack upon the head"], [210, "196 BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. of the train, north of Thompson's, was reported, and all wagons on the road were stopped until General Kimball could rush forward to clear the road, and General Wood deploy his division on the east of the road. The attack was repulsed by Major Steele, with stragglers that he had gathered together, and then the train, bereft of ten wagons burned by the enemy, moved on, with Wood's division on the right and Wagner's in the rear. At 5 a. m. the last wagon crossed the bridge, and then all was in motion. The enemy's cavalry was on the hills to the right for awhile, and made one or two dashes, but these were easily repulsed by Wood's skirmishers, with the help, at one time, of a section of Canby's battery. Colonel Opdycke's brigade formed the rear-guard, and though skirmishing with the pursuing forces of the enemy, kept them so well in check as to save the weary and lame from capture. Rarely has an army escaped so easily from a peril so threatening. It has been accepted as true that General Hood ordered one corps general and then another to attack the national troops when passing so near the front of his army, at Spring Hill; but these generals disobeyed the orders, so plainly imperative from the situation itself, as well as from the voice of the com mander-in-chief. From whatever cause the failure resulted, the opportunity of the campaign was lost to the Confederate army. General Schofield, with the head of his column, reached Franklin before daylight, and he immediately made prepara tion to pass the Harpeth river, as he had been ordered by General Thomas to fall behind this stream. The railroad bridge was fitted as rapidly as possible for the passage of wagons, and a foot-bridge was constructed, which also proved adequate for them. General Schofield's aim was to get his train and artillery over the river before the enemy could at tack him, but he nevertheless instructed General Cox to put the troops in line around the town, as the several divisions should arrive. The Twenty -third Corps formed the left and center \u2014 Cox's division on the left with its left flank on the river, Ruger's on its right, and Kimball's completing the cir cuit to the river on the right. Wood's division crossed to the north bank to be directed to the support of either flank in the"], [211, "BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. 197 event of a turning movement, and Wagner's was left in front to check the enemy, should he form his army to attack. Colonel Opdycke reached the heights two miles south of the town at noon, and was ordered to halt to observe the enemy. Crox ton's brigade of cavalry was pushed back by infantry on the Lewisburg turnpike, and at 1 p. m. Colonel Opdycke re ported heavy columns of infantry advancing on the Columbia and Lewisburg roads, when the division was withdrawn to the more immediate front of the army on the Columbia road. Colonel Opdycke, at his own notion, came inside the main line, and halted his brigade on the Columbia road in rear of the junction of the right and left flanks of Cox's and Ruger's di visions of the Twenty-third Corps. The line as formed, was about one mile and a half long, inclosing the town, except on the north where the Harpeth river was the boundary, with its flanks touching the river. The line rested on a slight elevation, or series of low hills, which encompassed the town. The troops threw up breast works, and a slight abatis was also constructed in places. The artillery of the Twenty-third Corps was on the north side of the river, and a portion of it placed in Fort Granger \u2014 a fortification previously constructed so as to command the rail road, which leaves the town near the river, and runs in paral lelism with it for some distance. The batteries of the Fourth Corps were held on the south side, some of them having been placed on the line and others in reserve. The Sixth Ohio Light Artillery and the First Kentucky battery were in position on the right and left of the Columbia road, before the bat tle opened. Battery \"M,\" Fourth United States Artillery, and battery \" G,\" First Ohio Light Artillery, were placed with the left brigade of the Twenty -third Corps, and Bridge's battery, Illinois Light Artillery, was posted in the center of Strickland's brigade of Ruger's division. The position was a good one for defense, and the undulations of the ground in front exposed the enemy in approaching. The key-point was Carter's Hill on the Columbia road, and was opposite the cen ter of General Hood's army, which was advancing on the Lewisburg, Columbia, and Carter's Creek turnpikes. General Croxton resisted the enemy's infantry on the Lewis-"], [212, "198 BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. burg road until 2 p. M., when, having learned that Forrest was moving to his left, as if to cross at Hughes' ferry, he crossed at McGarock's ford. He had hardly gained the north bank before it was reported that the enemy's cavalry were endeavor ing to cross at several points above Franklin. General Wil son now threw his whole force before General Forrest, and held him in check during the day and following night, in some cases driving back detachments after they had succeeded in crossing the river. Had General Forrest succeeded in crossing with his whole force, he could have caused a heavy detachment offerees from the little army to protect the trains already in motion toward Nashville, in anticipation of the withdrawal of the army from Franklin at 6 p. M., should Gen eral Hood make no attack. At the time that General Croxton was forced to cross the river, General Hood's infantry began to appear in great force in front of Wagner's two brigades, but it was not believed by the ranking generals of the national army, until 4 p. M., that he would attempt to carry the position by assault. But at this hour his army emerged from the woods, in splendid array, heavily massed on the Columbia road, two corps in front and one in reserve, and soon brushed away the two brigades of Wagner's division, posted in extreme exposure on the plain, opposite the massive center of the Confederate army. Gen eral Wagner had been instructed to check the enemy with these brigades, without involving them in an engagement with superior forces, but had, notwithstanding, directed their com manders, Colonels Conrad and Lane, to hold their position as long as possible. Conscious of their extreme peril they threw up barricades, and when General Hood finally advanced against them with his main lines, uncovered by skirmishers, their effort to check him precipitated a conflict so unequal as to have been hopeless from the first. When broken by the attack of an army, they fell back in great haste and disorder, and formed a shield for the enemy following upon their steps. The veteran troops mainly succeeded in reaching the main line of the national army, but a large portion of the raw troops were captured. The pursued and the pursuers broke through the intrenched line in company, carrying away por-"], [213, "BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. 199 tions of Reilley's brigade, on the right of General Cox's divis ion, and Strickland's, on the left of General Ruger's. And thus, without conflict on the immediate front of the national army or on the parapet, General Hood gained a lodgment at the key-point of the position, and commanded the direct ap proach to the bridges. He had gained this advantage, almost without firing a shot, after the rout of Conrad and Lane, and without receiving one, except that a portion of the troops of the brigade of the latter, having loaded guns, wheeled and fired as they crossed the intrenchments. Such an advantage, to an army of more than double the strength of the divisions holding the position, according to the precedents of war, was decisive of complete victory. But in this case it was not, though at first it seemed to be entirely so. The enemy's cen ter, made strong to thrust itself through the national line, had gained its immediate objective, and commenced at once to use two captured batteries in enfilading the national line, right and left, to double each fraction upon the flanks, and grasp the bridges between them. Two of the three brigades of Wagner's division, the only troops south of the river not in the main line, were so shattered that they could not be rallied for the emergency, and every moment of delay in attacking the enemy's forces that had gained the center, permitted their reinforcement from his rear lines. The teams from the cap tured batteries galloped to the rear, and intensified the im pression that the disaster was fatal. Conrad's brigade had entered the intrenchments near the Columbia road, and on the right of this road the enemy gained at the first dash three or four hundred yards of the line. Lane's brigade had crossed the parapet several hundred yards to the right, without dis turbing the troops at that point, and its volley had a marked effect upon the enemy. Toward the breach, the enemy's heavy central lines began at once to press, and to it his lateral lines were turned, in seemingly overwhelming convergence. To General Hood, the advantage so easily gained, promised the capture or destruction of the national army, and he and his army were inspired to quickest action to maintain and utilize it for this grand achievement. And he certainly could have maintained his hold of the national line, and used it for"], [214, "200 BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. extreme success, had time been given him to thrust into the breach his rapidly-advancing and massive rear lines ; and as it was, he began to gain ground, right and left from the Co lumbia road. When General Stanley first heard the noise of battle, he Avas with General Schofield, at his headquarters on the north bank of the river, a fifteen minutes' ride from Carter's Hill, and was entertaining the conviction, from the strength of the position and the former course of the enemy, that an assault was entirely improbable. But as soon as an attack was indi cated to him and others, in their distant view, he rode rapidly to his troops, and reached the left of Opdycke's brigade to find that a disaster, seemingly prophetic of the overthrow of the army, had came with the first onset of the enemy. In quick provision for the emergency, he approached this one reserve brigade, to order it to charge the enemy in the breach ; but seeing its gallant commander in front of its center leading it forward, he gave no orders, for none were needed, and taking position on the left of the line, the corps and brigade com manders, with common purpose to hurl back the enemy and restore the continuity of the line, cheered as they led this heroic brigade. When Colonel Opdycke had first seen the enemy within the intrenchments, he turned to his men from the front of the center of his brigade, to find they had already fixed bayonets for the encounter, which they plainly foresaw would be desperate and decisive ; for they were veterans who had charged the enemy on other fields, and yet they had never been called by orders, soldierly instincts, or patriotism to such a conflict as was now plainly before them. Their commander saw, in this unbidden act of preparation, and in their eyes and attitude, the response to his own purpose, and his ringing order, \" First brigade forward to the lines,\" was in harmony with the stern will of every officer and man of that brigade. And when he dashed on the breach, he gave expression to the courage and purpose of every man in that self-appointed for lorn hope, while those near General Stanley shouted : \" We can go where the general can.\" Opdycke rode forward until he reached the enemy, followed closely by his brigade. He first emptied his revolver, then clubbed it in the hand-to-hand"], [215, "201 BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. conflict, and as the deadly struggle raged more fiercely, he dismounted and clubbed a musket. His men fought as did their leader, and with bayonets baptized in blood, they hurled the enemy from the intrenchments and saved the army. This was one of the supreme moments of battle which heroes rec ognize, and by which only the bravest of the brave are in spired to deeds of daring, trarscendent from motive and mo mentous results. Four regimental commanders fell in the charge, but other officers of similar temper maintained the gallant leadership. Colonel Oydycke, foremost in the charge and throughout the ensuing conflict in the intrenchments, es caped injury. General Stanley also escaped for a time, but in leaving this brigade to look after other dispositions, was pierced in the neck by a bullet, and was compelled to leave the field. Colonel Opdycke's brigade recaptured eight pieces of artil lery, and with them four hundred prisoners ; wrenched ten battle-flags from the hands of the enemy, and left the ground behind them strewn with a greater number, which dropped under their blows. The number of prisoners and battle-flags, shows most plainly that General Hood was holding the po sition with an exceedingly strong force. The recaptured guns again changed the direction of their missiles of death, while the sheet of flame from Opdycke's bri gade and others in reach revealed to the enemy the necessity of other charges upon new and less promising conditions, or the abandonment of the conflict. Opdycke's charge regained nearly all the line that had been lost, but the enemy still held a small salient to the right of the Columbia road, and to main tain this point and widen the breach, General Hood and his subordinate commanders exerted themselves to the utmost. In counter effort, small portions of Conrad's and Lane's bri gades were directed to Opdycke's support. The enemy's first heavy line in his front was not more than fifty yards distant, and in addition to a direct fire from this line, he was subjected to an enfilading one from the troops still in the intrenchments on his right. It was next to impossible for his brigade to maintain position under this deadly cross-fire, but yet, in twenty minutes, through the vigorous support of troops on right and left, the enemy was entirely expelled, and the con-"], [216, "202 BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. tinuity of the line re-established- Then, in seeming retribution for General Schofield's escape at Spring Hill, and his own dis lodgment from his hope-giving grasp of the key-point of the national line, General Hood repeated his assaults with the expression of frenzied vengeance and valor. His subordinates, with a recklessness of life in keeping with the charge of Opdycke and his heroic brigade, led their columns to the mus kets of the national troops, charging repeatedly, mainly at Carter's Hill, and only desisted with the fall of night. In leadiDg a charge, General Cleburne, the most dashing division commander in the Confederate army, fell upon the parapet in front of Opdycke's brigade, and in the whole contest, five other generals were killed, six wounded, and one captured \u2014 a fact which reveals how the columns of the enemy were led ; while the loss of thirty-three battle-flags manifests the strength of the columns which gained the national lines. The defensive fire was so rapid from 4 p. M. to nightfall that it was difficult to supply the troops with ammunition. One hundred wagon-loads of artillery and infantry ammunition were used from the Fourth Corps train alone, and this ex penditure wrought fearful havoc in the ranks of the enemy, whose boldness placed them much of the time at short range. Firing, of more or less severity, was maintained until nearly midnight, the enemy continuing his activity to determine the time of the withdrawal of the national army, and to embarras such a movement. General Hood buried seventeen hundred and fifty men on the field. He had three thousand eight hundred so disabled as to be placed in hospitals, and lost seven hundred and two captured \u2014 an aggregate of six thousand two hundred 'and fifty two, exclusive of those slightly wounded. General Schofield lost one hundred and eighty-nine killed, one thousand and thirty -three wounded, and one thousand one hundred and four missing \u2014 an aggregate of two thousand three hundred and twenty-six. More than half of this loss was from Wagner's division, from the exposure of Conrad's and Lane's brigades, and from the charge and subsequent fighting of Op dycke's brigade. The battle of Franklin, for its proportions, was one of the"], [217, "BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. 203 grandest of the war. The salient features of this battle were the position and action of the two brigades posted in front of the main line, and the gallantry of the third, after the enemy had carried the intrenchments on Carter's Hill. The reports of Generals Schofield, Stanley, and Cox declare that it was not the expectation that the brigades in front should resist until they should be compromised in an engagement with superior forces, and that General Wagner was so instructed. Nevertheless, the two brigade commanders were instructed by General Wagner to hold their position as long as possible, and having been thus impressed with the necessity of extreme re sistance, they did not abandon their position until forced to do so by the bayonets of the enemy, and then their hurried retreat brought disaster to their own army. Their resistance, if not prudent, was exceedingly gallant, and veterans and new troops alike displayed the highest qualities of soldiers in confronting in actual conflict an army of three corps, and deserve mention in history as brave and heroic, under circumstances of extreme trial and peril. With regard to the second prominent feature of this battle, it may be said that seldom in the history of war has a single brigade* made itself so conspicuous in saving an army, and its transcendent action must be accepted as proof that its previous training and experience, and the manhood of its members had given the morale \u2014 the elan requisite for such an emergency. It was no new experience for Colonel Opdycke to ride in a charge in advance of his men, for this he did in developing the enemy in front of General Thomas' right, after the great dis aster at the battle of Chickamauga. He charged, too, with a demi-brigade on Missionary Ridge, and with his regiment, the One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Ohio, on Rocky Face Ridge, and the officers and men of his brigade were meet for such a leader. And General Stanley, sick as he was, manifested his appreciation of the emergency as well as his personal gallantry, in descending from the command of a corps to take the left * This brigade comprised the One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Ohio; the Twenty-fourth Wisconsin ; the Thirty-sixth, Fourty-fourth, Seventy-third, Seventy-fourth, and Eighty-eighth Illinois regiments."], [218, "204 BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. of a brigade, in an action plainly decisive of the battle. For beyond all power of generalship to mold the battle or control its issue, the simple charge of Opdycke's brigade stands in bold est relief. The enemy having been repulsed and the trains transferred to the north bank of the Harpeth river, the problem to solve was the safe withdrawal of the army to Nashville. It was still in General Hood's power, having great superiority in both infantry and cavalry, to cross the river above General Scho field's position, and unless prevented by battle or withdrawal, to throw his army between Franklin and Nashville. As to the propriety of withdrawal, there was no question, either with the general officers at Franklin, including General Scho field, or with General Thomas. So that the movement to the rear, meditated before the battle, was commenced as soon as the quietness of the enemy permitted. During the early part of the night the artillery was transferred to the north bank, and at midnight the army crossed the river without loss or special hinderance. General Wood retained his position until 3 A. m., and then moved northward as the rear-guard of the army. General Hood perceived the retirement early, and though following closely, wrought no damage. General Wood had destroyed the bridges before leaving position, and his divis ion in rear of the army, with Wilson's cavalry on its flanks, was able to beat back General Hood's head of column, which he could not under the circumstances make strong in time, even to greatly harass so strong a force. With the exception of a brush between Hammond's brigade of cavalry and some portion of Forrest's command at Brentwood, the enemy pro voked no engagement, and the army marched quietly to Nash ville. The rear column reached that city at 1 p. m., and the different corps were assigned to positions on the defensive line which General Thomas had selected. The Twenty -third Corps, under General Schofield, was assigned to the left, extending to the Nolensville turnpike ; the Fourth Corps, General Wood commanding, in room of General Stanley, disabled by his wound, took position in the center ; and the corps from the \" Army of the Tennessee,\" General A. J. Smith commanding,"], [219, "205 BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. having arrived the day before, held the right, with its flank touching the river below the city. In view of General Hood's superiority of force, his opera tions thus far had fallen behind just expectations. He had allowed General Schofield to pass safely before his army, after he had touched his communications, while he was yet at Co lumbia, and he had met most disastrous defeat at Franklin, in assaults that could not be repeated wTith greater vigor. The consequent depression in his army was doubtless excessive. Thus far, none of the grand results of his northward march, as announced with prophetic emphasis by Mr. Davis, had been achieved, although General Sherman had swept southward from Northern Georgia and on toward Savannah, with sixty five thousand men ; and the Confederate army, of which so much had been expected, was now far from its base, thus far defeated in the accomplishment of its great aims, with the consciousness that the conditions of ultimate success were passing day by clay beyond the range of possibilities. To go back would express total defeat; and before General Hood was a fast-increasing army, posted on a strong defensive line, with a deep river behind, and its key-points fortified early in the war ; and as he could not at once go round Nashville, he sat before the city and extended his lines in semblance of a siege, which should last until General Thomas should be fully ready to throw him upon the defensive. General Thomas had hoped to deliver battle at some point farther to the south ; but his reinforcements had come too slowly, and his cavalry horses had come as tardily as his acces sions of troops. His forces were not fully in hand, and those that had fought their way from Columbia were physically ex hausted beyond the ordinary experience of veterans on long marches and months under fire. During the seven days of Hood's advance from the Tennessee, he had hurried his prep arations for the battle now palpably imminent. On the 29th of November, he had ordered General Milroy to abandon Tullahoma and retire to Murfreesboro, leaving a garrison in the block-house at Elk River bridge. The same day, he had ordered General Steedman, with a provisional division of five thousand men, composed of detachments from the corps with"], [220, "206 BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. General Sherman and a brigade of colored troops, to move to Nashville. Nashville had been placed in a state of defense; additional fortifications had been constructed under the diree sion of Brigadier-General Tower, and the whole had been manned by the regular garrison, reinforced by a provisional force, under Brevet Brigadier-General Donaldson, chief quar termaster, composed of the employes of the quartermaster and commissary departments. No other forces were now ex pected, except the brigade of General Cooper, of Ruger's division, which having watched the fords of Duck river, below Columbia, was now marching to Nashville by a detour to evade the enemy. With the cavalry remounted, and this hete rogeneous force organized, General Thomas proposed to assume the offensive and dispute with General Hood the pos session of Tennessee. Nashville, November 12, 1864 \u2014 8.30 a. m. Major-General Sherman : Your dispatch of 12 o'clock last night received. I have no fears that Beauregard can do us any harm now, and if he attempts to follow you I will follow him as far as possible. If he does not follow you, I will then thoroughly organize, and, I believe, shall have men enough to ruin him, unless he gets out of the way very rapidly. The country of Middle Ala bama, I learn, is teeming with supplies this year, which will be greatly to our advantage. I have no additional news to report from the direction of Florence. I am now convinced that the greater part of Beauregard's army is near Florence and Tuscumbia, and that you will at least have a clear road before you for several days, and that your success will fully equal your expectations. GEORGE H. THOMAS, Major-General. Vicksburc, November 8, 1864, via Cairo, November 14, 1864. Major-General Sherman : Major-General Thomas : Your dispatch of October 30th was received yesterday. Hatch's divis ion of cavalry was at the Tennessee river at last account. Two infantry divisions under General A. J. Smith, and a brigade of cavalry, are in Mis souri in pursuit of Price. They have been ordered to Memphis by nearest route, but this is contingent on where the orders may reach them, and the time uncertain. The effective field force left on the river is very light, and the posts from Cairo to Natchez are held by small garrisons, but I will, to the extent of my force, carry out your instructions.

Send me the first reliable news you have from Hatch. Smith telegraphed me two days ago, that his troops had been delayed by bad roads and impassable streams, but that he would make all possible speed. I can not say when he will be here. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. Headquarters Military Division of the West, Tuscumbia, November 17, 1864. General J. B. Hood, Commanding, etc., General : General Beauregard directs me to say that he desires you will take the offensive at the earliest practicable moment, and deal the enemy rapid and vigorous blows, striking him whilst thus dispersed, and by this means distract Sherman's advance into Georgia. . . .

A victory in Tennessee will relieve Georgia. ********* G. T. BEAUREGARD, General. Pulaski, November 18, 1864. Major-General Thomas. I have received no report from General Hatch this evening. His re port yesterday indicated that Hood was about to move, but I think there is no probability of his moving this way while this weather continues J. M. SCHOFIELD, Major- General. Headquarters Department of the Cumberland, Nashville, November 19, 1864. Major-General A. J. Smith, or commanding officer of troops en route for Nashville, Paducah, Ky. : Start for Nashville, via Cumberland river, as soon as possible after re ceiving this, with what troops you have, and leave orders for the balance to follow the same route. Acknowledge receipt, GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. Headquarters Department of the Cumberland, Nashville, November 19, 1864 \u2014 2.30 p. m. Major-General Schofield, Pulaski : If the enemy advance in force, as General Hatch believes, have every thing in readiness to fight him at Pulaski, if he advances on that place, or cover the railroad and concentrate at Columbia. Should he attempt to turn your right flank, in the latter case \u2014 that is, the attempt to turn your right flank \u2014 General Hatch should cover the fords and ferries across Duck river, and hold them when you concentrate at Columbia. Report to me at once, should you be compelled to leave Pulaski, that I may give the necessary orders for the concentration of the troops on the Nashville and Chattanooga railroad. I can hardly think, however, that the enemy will attempt to advance in such weather as we now have. I shall send an officer to-morrow morning to hurry General Smith's troops along as fast as possible to this place. Give the necessary orders to Hatch and Croxton, in case of a decided advance of the enemy. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. vol. n \u2014 14"], [224, "210 BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC.

I have already given the neces sary preliminary instructions to Hatch, and will have everything ready to carry out your orders in the event of Hood's advance. I do not be lieve he will attempt to move his infantry in this state of roads, but Forrest may make a raid on our railroads. J. M. SCHOFIELD, Major- General. Headquarters Department of the Cumberland, Nashville, November 20, 1864 \u2014 2.30 p. m. Major-General Schofield, Pulaski : If Forrest makes a decided advance, I think it would be best for you to go to Lynnville with two divisions, leaving Stanley two at Pulaski. In order to have everything out of your way, the construction party which went to Pulaski a few days since had better come back to Columbia, and all surplus stores should be prepared to be sent back in case Hood's army advances. Give Hatch instructions according to your movements, and urge upon him the necessity of getting the most reliable information he can. I will order Ruger with one brigade to Columbia. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. Nashville, November 20, 1864 \u2014 5.30 p. m. Major-General A. J. Smith, St. Louis, Mo. : Your dispatch of this date just received. I wish you to make every exertion to reach this place with all possible dispatch. Bring with you all the troops ordered to report to you at Paducah, as well as all others belonging to your command.

Headquarters Department of the Cumberland, Nashville, November 21, 1864. Major-General Schofield, Pulaski : Have you seen General Hatch's dispatch from Lexington at 8 a. m. to day? It is very detailed, and he thinks it reliable. I have just received your two telegrams of 11 a. m. and 12 m., and approve the move. I have sent General Wilson out to take general charge of the cavalry, and di rected him to report to you. He will reach Lynnville to-morrow morning. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V.

Major-General Thomas : I now have your dispatch of 9 a.m. 1 do not believe Forrest has had time to get across Duck river yet, and hope the troops you have sent will be in time to prevent him. Capron was driven in very rapidly, and by a pretty large force. Cox arrived just in time to beat it back, and punished it very severely. Hood had ten miles the start of Stanley at noon yester day, but Stanley outmarched him, and reached here at 10 o'clock to-day. His troops are all here and in position. Colonel Moore got here last night. My orders to Hatch are as you suggested. I have not heard from him to-day. J. M. SCHOFIELD, Major-General. Columbia, November 24, 1864 \u2014 1.30 p. m. Major-General G. H. Thomas : Do you think it important to hold Columbia ? My force is not large enough to cover the town and the railroad bridge. I can hold a shorter line covering the railroad bridge, leaving the town and the railroad depot outside ; but in any case the enemy can turn the position by crosssing above"], [226, "212 BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. or below, and rendering withdrawal to the north bank very difficult. Please give me your views soon. J. M. SCHOFIELD, Major-General. Headquarters Department of the Cumberland, Nashville, November 24, 1864 \u2014 3 p. M. Major-General Schofield, Columbia : If you can not hold Columbia, you had better withdraw to the north bank of the river. From the description given, I supposed the line was sufficiently short to enable you and Stanley to hold it securely and have a reserve. But it is better, of course, to substantially check the enemy than to run the risk of defeat by resisting too much. Where is Stanley? Is he with you? GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. Washington, November 25, 1864 \u2014 12 m. Major-General Thomas : Secretary war authorizes you, if you deem it necessary, to call upon the governor of Indiana and of any other Western states for troops. As this force is very expensive, if compared with its value against an enemy, it should be used as sparingly as circumstances will admit. Dispatches just received from Hilton Head indicate that General Sherman has captured Milledgeville and Macon, and that Beauregard has been recalled from Tennessee to fall on General Sherman's rear. This is also indicated through Beauregard's proclamation to the people of Mississippi, sent from Corinth through Selma. H. W. HALLECK, Major-General and Chief of Staff.

GRANT, Lieutenant-General. Headquarters Department of the Cumberland, Nashville, November 25, 1864. Lieutenant-General Grant, City Point, -Va. : Your dispatch of 4 p. m. yesterday just received. Hood's entire army is in front of Columbia, and so greatly outnumbering mine at this time, that I am compelled to act on the defensive. None of General Smith's troops have arrived yet, although they embarked at St. Louis on Tuesday last. The transportation of General Hatch's and Grierson's cavalry was"], [227, "213 BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. ordered by General Washburne, I am told, to be turned in at Memphis, Which has crippled the only cavalry I have at this time. All of my cavalry ft-as dismounted to furnish horses to Kilpatrick's division, which went with General Sherman. My dismounted cavalry is now detained at Louisville, awaiting arms and horses. Horses are arriving slowly, and arms have been detained somewhere en route for more than a month. General Grierson has been delayed by conflicting orders in Kansas and from Memphis, and it is impossible to say when he will reach here. Since being in charge of affairs in Tennessee, I have lost nearly fifteen thou sand men, discharged by expiration of service, and permitted to go home to vote. My gain is probably twelve thousand of perfectly raw troops ; therefore, as the enemy so greatly outnumbers me, both in infantry and cavalry, I am compelled for the present to act on the defensive. The moment I can get my cavalry, I will march against Hood, and if Forrest can be reached, he will be punished. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. Headquarters Department of the Cumberland, Nashville, November 25, 1864 \u2014 11.20 a. m. Major-General Schofield, Columbia: In case you have to move to the north bank of Duck river, I wish you to keep some cavalry on the south side of it, to observe and delay Hood's advance on Chattanooga railroad as much as possible. I hope to have five (5) regiments of Granger's troops in Murfreesboro to-day. Have made arrangements for Milroy to fall back to Murfreesboro on this side of Duck river ; also, if the enemy advances, the cavalry on the south side of Duck river should cover the approaches to Shelbyville, and cross at that place, and hold the bridge in case of an advance in force. I have asked Steedman how large a force he can raise to threaten the enemy's rear, should he get on the Chattanooga road, and expect an answer soon. About one thousand of Hatch's cavalry have arrived here from Mem phis dismounted, and they will be mounted here as soon as possible, and sent to the front. Three regiments should start to-day, making about one thousand men. Have not heard of any of Smith's troops yet. Some of them will surely be here to-day. If Hood moves on the Chattanooga road, I will send Smith to Murfreesboro, as we shall be enabled thereby to concentrate more rapidly. If you can hold Hood on the south side of Duck river, I think we shall be able to drive him back easily after con centrating. Answer, giving your views. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V.

The force is reported to be infantry, but I do not regard it as being probable. Wilson has gone with his main force to learn the facts, and drive the enemy back, if possible. J. M. SCHOFIELD Major- General. Nashville, November 28, 1864. Major-General Schofield, near Columbia: Your dispatch of 3.30 is just received. If General Wilson can not suc ceed in driving back the enemy, should it prove true that he has crossed the river, you will necessarily have to make preparations to take up a new position at Franklin, behind Harpeth, immediately, if it becomes neces sary to fall back. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U S. V. Commanding. Nashville, November 28, 1864. Major-General Schofield : You can have some of the pontoons you used at Columbia sent to Franklin, to lay a bridge there. I will answer your other telegram in a few moments. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. Near Columbia, November 28, 1864\u201411 a. m. Major-General Thomas: I am in doubt whether it is advisable, with reference to future opera tions, to hold this position or retire to some point from which we can move offensively. Of course, we can not recross the river here. I could have easily held the bridge-head at the railroad, but it would have been useless, as we could not possibly advance from that point. Please give me your views and wishes. J. M. SCHOFIELD, Major- General."], [230, "216 BATTLE, OF FRANKLIN, ETC. Near Columbia, November 28, 1864 \u2014 6 p. m. Major-General Thomas : The enemy's cavalry in force has crossed the river on the Lewisburg pike, and is now in possession of Rally Hill. Wilson is trying to go on the Franklin road ahead of them. He thinks the enemy may swing in between him and me and strike Spring Hill, and wants Hammond's bri gade halted there. Please give orders, if you know where it is. J. M. SCHOFIELD, Major-General. Near Columbia, November 28, 1864 \u2014 9 p. m. Major-General Thomas : If Hood advances on the Lewisburg and Franklin pike, where do you propose to fight him ? I have all the force that is necessary, and Smith's troops should be placed with reference to the proposed point of concen tration. J. M. SCHOFIELD, Major-General. Nashville, November 29, 1864 \u2014 3.30 a. m. Major-General Schofield, near Columbia : Your dispatches of 6 p. m. and 9 p. m. yesterday are received. I have directed General Hammond to halt his command at Spring Hill, and re port to you for orders, if he can not communicate with General Wilson, and also instructing him to keep you well advised of the enemy's move ments. I desire you to fall back from Columbia, and take up your posi tion at Franklin, leaving a sufficient force at Spring Hill to contest the enemy's progress until you are securely posted at Franklin. The troops at the fords below Williamsport, etc., will be withdrawn, and take up a position behind Franklin. General A. J. Smith's command has not yet reached Nashville. As soon as he arrives, I will make immediate disposi tion of his troops, and notify you of the same. Please send me a report as to how matters stand, upon your receipt of this. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. Headquarters, Hart's Cross-roads, on Franklin and Lewisburg Pike, November 29, 1S64 \u2014 3 a. m. ; via Franklin, 9.30 a. m. Major-General Tliomas : Forrest's cavalry, Buford's, Chalmers', and Jackson's brigades, a part of Hanley's and Biffle's regiments, crossed Duck river on this road, and at several fords between it and Huey's Mills, seven miles above Columbia, yesterday. A pontoon train, sufficient for three bridges, had arrived at nuey's just before dark. The bridges were expected to be ready by 11 o'clock last night, and their infantry across by daylight this morning. The cavalry began crossing about noon, at Davis' fords, near Huey's, but"], [231, "217 BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. could not get across at Hardison's, on the pike. Capron's and Garrard's brigades were struck in flank and rear by rebels, at Rally Hill. I have kept Major-General Schofield fully informed, and, at 1 a. m., sent him the information above, advising him to get back to Franklin at once. I have all of my command, except Hammond's and Hatch's first brigade, here. I do n't know where the former is. The latter has been watching the river at Knobgrass creek, and was ordered, at sunset last night, to join him at Spring Hill. I shall delay the enemy all in my power, if he presses me, and follow him wherever he goes. I have information from Franklin's Hill to-day. The Sixth Illinois is now probably near that place to-night, having gone to Shelbyville on a scout. I am sure, from what prisoners tell me, that the enemy is aiming for Nashville, via Frank lin; his present direction, location of his bridge, and other circumstances point clearly to that conclusion. This being so, I shall probably cross the Harpeth midway between Triune and Franklin, and aim for Nolensville. Everything should be got off the railroad to-day. Hurry forward all cav alry, via Nolensville. I think everything should be concentrated at Nashville. J. H. WILSON, Major- General. Headquarters Army of the Ohio, November 29 \u2014 8.30 a. m. Major-General Thomas : The enemy's cavalry has crossed in force, on the Lewisburg pike, and General Wilson reports the infantry crossing above Huey's Mills, about five miles from this place. I have sent an infantry reconnoissance to learn the facts. If it prove true, I will act according to your instructions received this morning. Please send orders to General Cooper,\u2122 via Johnsonville ; it may be doubtful whether my messenger from here will reach him. J. M. SCHOFIELD, Major- General. Headquarters, 4i Miles Southeast of Franklin, November 29, 1864 \u2014 2 p. m., via Franklin. Major-General Thomas : The enemy pressed the rear of my column closely as far as the Ridge Meeting-house, ,and by marching around my left prevented me from getting upon the Fayetteville road. My impression is that Forrest is aiming for Nashville, via Triune and Nolensville. A part of his force may have cut into Spring Hill. Heavy artillery firing heard in that direction since 1 1 a. m. I can not hear from Schofield, but fear he may not have reached Franklin. I shall hold Hatch's second brigade and * Commanding a brigade of General Ruger's di vision."], [232, "218 BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. Hammond's here till I know all is clear. In the meantime, Johnson and Croxton are crossing the Harpeth at Henderson's ford, with orders to push strong parties to Triune Zend Grove, and thereby to push on to Nolensville to-night, if they find the enemy moving in that direction. I shall go in the same direction as soon as I can leave here with safety. You had better look out for Forrest at Nashville to-morrow noon. I '11 be there before, or very soon after he makes his appearance. J. H. WILSON, Brevet Major-General. Nashville, November 29, 1864 \u2014 11 p. M. Major-General Schofield, Franklin : General Wilson has telegraphed me very fully the movements of the enemy yesterday and this morning. He believes Forrest is aiming to strike this place, while the infantry will move against you, and attempt to get on your flank. If you discover such to be his movement, you had better cross Harpeth at Franklin, and then retire along the Franklin pike to this place, covering your wagon train and the railroad. I directed General Cooper, in accordance with your wishes yesterday, to withdraw from Centreville, by the Nashville road, crossing Harpeth at widow Dean's, and to report to you from that place for further orders. You had better send orders to meet him. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. Franklin, November 29, 1864 \u2014 10 p. M. Major-General Thomas \u2022\" Major-General Schofield directs me to inform you that the enemy's cavalry crossed Duck river in force at daylight this morning, at Huey's Mills, six miles from Columbia, and pushed at once for Spring Hill. Their cavalry reached that point at 4 p. M., and their infantrv came in before dark, and attacked General Stanley, who held the place with one division very heavily (engaged?). General Schofield's troops are pushing foi Franklin as rapidly as possible. The general says he will not be able to get farther than Thompson's Station to-night, and possibly not farther than Spring Hill. He regards his situation as extremely perilous, and fears he may be forced into a general battle to-morrow, or lose his wagon train. General Wilson's cavalry have been pushed off toward the east, and do not come with our infantry, nor cover the pike. Thinking that the troops under General A. J. Smith's command had reached Franklin, General Schofield directed me to have them pushed down the Franklin pike to Spring Hill, by daylight to-morrow. I left General Schofield two hours ago, at Thompson's Station. W. J. TWININGS, Captain, Aid-de-Camp, and Chief Engineer, Army of Ohio."], [233, "219 BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. EXTRACT FROM GENERAL THOMAS' REPORT. The important result of this signal victory can not be too highly appre ciated, for it not only seriously checked the enemy's advance and gave Gen eral Schofield time to move his troops and all his property to Nashville, but it also caused deep depression among the men of Hood's army, making them doubly cautious in their subsequent movements. Not willing to risk a renewal of the battle on the morrow, and having accom plished the object of the day's operations \u2014 viz., to cover the withdrawal of his trains \u2014 General Schofield, by my advice and direction, fell back during the night, to Nashville; in front of which city, line of battle was formed, by noon of the 1st of December, on the heights immediately surrounding Nashville. EXTRACTS FROM GENERAL SCHOFIELD'S REPORT. The troops rested in this position on the 28th, and I had strong hopes of being able to hold the line of Duck river until reinforcements should arrive; but I learned from General Wilson, about 2 a. m. on the 29th, that the enemy's cavalry had forced a crossing near the Lewisburg pike, and about daylight in the morning, that his infantry was also crossing at Huey's Mills, five miles above Columbia, from which a road leads into the Franklin pike, at Spring Hill. The enemy might endeavor to reach the latter place in advance of me, and thus cut off my retreat, or strike me in flank near Duck river, or both. He had already forced a column of cavalry between General Wilson and me, and cut off all communication between us. I therefore sent General Stanley with a division of infantry to Spring Hill, to hold that point and cover the trains ; General Cox was left in his position, to hold the crossing at Columbia ; Generals Wood and Kimball were put in line facing Huey's Mills, with a brigade thrown for ward to recohnoiter, and General Ruger was ordered to move on to the pike, in rear of Rutherford's creek, leaving one regiment to hold the ford near the railroad bridge, the bridges having been destroyed. About 3 p. m. I became satisfied that the enemy would not attack my position on Duck river, but was pushing two corps direct for Spring Hill. I then gave the necessary orders for the withdrawal of the troops after dark, and took General Ruger's troops and pushed for Spring Hill, to re open communication with General Stanley, and was followed at a short distance by the head of the main column. I struck the enemy's cavalry at dark, about three miles from Spring Hill, but we brushed them away without difficulty, and reached Spring Hill about seven o'clock. . . . I arrived at Franklin with the head of the column a little before day light on the 30th, and found no wagon-bridge for crossing the river, and the fords in very bad condition. I caused the railroad bridge to be pre pared for crossing wagons, and had a foot-bridge built for infantry, which fortunately proved available for wagons, and used the ford as much as possible. I hoped, in spite of the difficulties, to get all my material, in-"], [234, "220 BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. eluding the public property and a large wagon train, across the river, and move the army over before the enemy could get up force enough to attack me ; but I put the troops in position as they arrived on the south side \u2014 the Twenty-third Corps on the left and center, covering the Colum bia and Lewisburg pikes, and General Kimball's division of the Fourth Corps on the right, both flanks resting on the river. Two brigades of Wagner's division were left in front to retard the enemy's advance, and General Wood's division, with some artillery, was moved to the north bank of the river, to cover the flanks, should the enemy attempt to cross above or below. The enemy followed close after our rear-guard ; brought up and deployed two full corps with astonishing celerity, and moved rapidly forward to the attack. Our outposts, imprudently brave, held their ground too long, and hence were compelled to come in at a run. In passing over the parapet, they carried with them the troops of the line for a short space, and permitted a few hundred of the enemy to get in ; but the reserves sprang forward, regaining the parapet, and capturing those of the enemy who had passed it. The enemy assaulted persistently and continuously with his whole force, from about 3.30 p. m. until after dark, and made numerous Intermittent attacks at a few points until about 10 o'clock p. m. He was splendidly repulsed along the whole line of attack. . . . It is to be observed that more than half our loss occurred in Wagner's division of the Fourth Corps, which did not form part of the main line of defense. This loss arose in two brigades of that division, from their remaining in front of the line after their proper duty as outposts had been accomplished, and after they should have taken their position in reserve; and in the other brigade (Colonel Opdycke's), in its hand-to hand encounter with the enemy over the parapet, which had been tem porarily lost by the precipitate retreat of the other two brigades. My exp^ri^nce on the 29th had shown how entirely inferior a force my cavalry was to that of the enemy, and that even my immediate flank and rear were insecure, while my communication with Nashville was en tirely without protection. I could not even rely upon getting up ammu nition necessary for another battle. To remain longer at Franklin, was to seriously hazard the loss of my army, by giving the enemy another chance to cut me off from reinforcements, which he had made three desperate futile attempts to accomplish. I had detained the enemy long enough to enable you to concentrate your scattered troops at Nashville, and had succeeded in inflicting upon him very heavy losses, which was the primary object. I had found it impossible to detain him long enough to get reinforcements at Franklin. Only a small portion of the infantry and none of the cavalry could reach me in time to be of any use in battle, which must have been fought on the 1st of December, for these reasons. After consulting with corps and division commanders, and ob taining your approval, I determined to retire the night of the 30th toward Nashville."], [235, "BATTLE OF FRANKLIN, ETC. 221 EXTRACT FROM GENERAL STANLEY'S REPORT. From 1 o'clock until 4 p. m. in the evening, the enemy's entire force was in sight, and forming for attack; yet, in view of the strong position we held, and reasoning from the former course of the rebels during the campaign, nothing appeared so improbable as that they would assault. I felt so confident in this belief, that I did not leave General Schofield's headquarters until the firing commenced. About 4 o'clock the enemy advanced with his whole force, at least two corps, making a bold and persistent assault, which, upon part of the line, lasted forty minutes, when Wagner's division fell back from the heights south of Franklin. Opdycke's brigade was placed in reserve, in rear of our main line on the Columbia pike; Lane's and Conrad's brigades were deployed, the former on the right, the other on the left of the pike, and about three hundred yards in advance of the main line. By whose mistake I can not tell, it certainly was never a part of my instructions, but these brigades had orders from General Wagner not to retire to the main line until forced to do so by the fighting of the enemy. Speaking of the effect of their retreat, General Stanley said: \"It was at that moment I arrived at the scene of disorder, coming from the town on the Columbia pike. The moment was critical beyond any I have ever known in battle. Could the enemy hold that part of the line, he was nearer our two bridges than the extremities of our line. Colonel Opdycke's brigade was lying down about one hundred yards in rear of the works. I rode quickly to the left regiment and called to them to charge ; at the same time I saw Colonel Opdycke near the center of his line, urging his men forward. I gave the colonel no order, as I saw him engaged in doing the very thing to save us, namely, to get possession of our line again.\" EXTRACT FROM GENERAL J. H. WILSON'S REPORT. At 1 a. m. (November 29), I sent a dispatch to General Schofield, in forming him that the force at Huey's Mill was Forrest's cavalry, consisting of Chalmers', Jackson's, and Buford's divisions, and Biffle's regiment; that the rebel infantry were to have began crossing two hours before, by three pontoon bridges under construction at the same place. Believing the information to be perfectly correct, I therefore suggested that our infantry should reach Spring Hill by 10 a. m. of that day."], [236, "222 CHAPTER XXXV. BATTLE OF NASHVILLE AND PURSUIT OF THE ROUTED ENEMY. The arrival of General Steedman with his command from Chattanooga, December 1st, in the evening, completed the concentration of forces, which had been so unexpectedly de layed. Three lines of defence had been abandoned because the promised troops had not appeared in Tennessee. And now that the concentration had been effected, the improvised army contained three corps, each one of which represented a distinct department; a provisional division made up of de tachments from almost every organization, large and small, embraced in the sixty -five thousand men, then on \" the march to the sea ;\" an infusion of raw infantry regiments ; the greater portion of the cavalry of the Military Division of the Missis sippi, but still largely dismounted ; and colored soldiers, who were to have their first opportunity in the central theater of war, to fight by brigades. General Thomas had held General Steedman's command, on the line of the Nashville and Chattanooga railroad for two reasons \u2014 one, the complications in East Tennessee, of which a narrative will be given in another chapter ; and the other, the probability that General Hood wrould strike that important railroad south of Nashville. Having arrived, General Steed man took position about a mile in advance of the left center of the main line, and east of the Nolensville turnpike. Gen eral Wilson, with his cavalry, had previously taken a strong position at Thomson's Chapel, on the Nolensville turnpike, covering the space between General Schofield's left and the Cumberland river. General Hood being still greatly superior in cavalry, there"], [237, "BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. 223 was danger that he would detach a large portion of it to inter rupt the vital communications with Louisville. To guard against the passage of his cavalry over the Cumberland, above Nashville, General Hammond's brigade of cavalry was sent to Gallatin on the 2d, to watch the river as far up as Carthage. And the day following General Thomas threw all the remain ing cavalry across to Edgefield, and then General Steedman's command covered the space between General Schofield's left and the river. General Hood's infantry did not approach Nashville until the 3d, when General Thomas' outposts were driven in, and soon after the enemy began to establish his main line. The next morning his salient was seen on Montgomery Hill, within six hundred yards of the center of the national line. Gen eral Hood's investing lines occupied the high ground on the southeast side of Brown's creek, extending from the Nolens ville turnpike, across the Granny White and Franklin turn pikes, in a southwesterly direction, to the hills south and south west of Biehland creek, and down that creek to the Hillsboro turnpike. From his right, on the Nolensville road to the river, above the city, and from his left, on the Hillsboro road to the river below, his cavalry were posted. Intent upon com pleting and strengthening his line, General Hood made no re sponse to the fire of artillery, which opened upon him from several points. It was doubtless necessary, too, that he should be economical in the use of his ammunition, as it was difficult for him to replenish from his base at Corinth. Although not active at Nashville, General Hood was enter prising in other directions. He sent Bate's division of Cheat ham's corps to reduce Murfreesboro and other minor points in the vicinity, and on the 4th the block-house, at Overall's creek, five miles north of Murfreesboro, was attacked by this force. But such was the strength of the block-house con structed for the defense of the railroad bridge, that although seventy-four artillery shots were fired against it, the garrison held out until General Milroy arrived with reinforcements from Murfreesboro, consisting of three regiments of infantry, four companies of cavalry, and a section of artillery. General Bate was then attacked and driven away. During the 5th,"], [238, "224 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. 6th, and 7th, having been reinforced by a division from Lee's corps, and twenty-five hundred cavalry, General Bate demon strated heavily against Fortress Bosecrans, near Murfrees boro, held by eight thousand men, under General Eousseau. The enemy declining to make a direct attack, General Milroy was sent against him on the 8th, with seven regiments of in fantry. He was found on the Wilkinson turnpike behind rail barricades, which were carried by assault \u2014 General Milroy capturing two hundred and seven prisoners and two guns, and suffering a loss of thirty men killed, and one hundred and seventy -five wounded. The same day Buford's cavalry, after shelling Murfreesboro, entered the town, but were driven out by a regiment of infantry and a section of artillery. The whole force then moved to Lebanon and down the bank of the Cumberland river to Nashville, threatening to cross, to in terrupt the Louisville and Nashville railroad. A portion of the enemy's cavalry, under General Lyon, suc ceeded in crossing the Cumberland river above Clarksville, on the 9th. The object of the movement was to reach the Louis ville and Nashville railroad, at some point in Kentucky, and to prevent its accomplishment General Thomas directed Gen eral McCook, who was in Kentucky, to remount Watkins' and La Grange's brigades of cavalry, and to look after Lyon with these brigades. Daring the first half of December, General Grant felt great uneasiness with regard to the situation in Tennessee, fearing that General Hood would pass round Nashville and march into Kentucky reproducing the scenes and issues of the sum mer and autumn of 1862. Believing that General Thomas should have delivered battle immediately after the engagement at Franklin, he urged him thereafter, from day to day, to at tack General Hood. General Thomas, on the other hand, thought it advisable to remount his cavalry and make other preparations, that he might be assured of victory, before as suming the offensive, and at the same time gain the full results of victory by a vigorous pursuit of the enemy, when defeated and routed. He was confident of final success, and was vigi lant in guarding the river with his cavalry, and secured the services of the gunboats of the Eleventh Division of the Mis-"], [239, "225 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. sissippi Squadron, under Lieutenant-Commander Leroy Fitch, to patrol the river above and below the city. During the first eight days of the month, General Wilson had raised his cavalry to good strength, by the influx of new horses and by ransacking the corrals for convalescent animals, and in this time much had been done to supply the army with the transportation essential to successful pursuit, and with pon toons for the full rivers. But delay for any cause was dis pleasing to General Grant, as besides the supposed danger to Kentucky, the troops under General Canby on the Mis sissippi river, intended for co-operation with General Sher man, were detained to prevent the trans-Mississippi Confed erate forces, from joining General Hood, and on the 9th of December at the suggestion of the lieutenant-general, an order was issued by the President, relieving General Thomas, and placing General Schofield in command. General Thomas himself preferred to be relieved rather than be responsible for a battle fought under unfavorable conditions. The order re lieving him, however, was subsequently suspended ; but there was no respite to the urgent communications requiring the deliverance of battle without delay. General Thomas at first hoped to be ready for battle on the 7th, but on account of delay in remounting his cavalry, he was not ready until the 9th. But with the completion of his preparations there came a sleet which rendered the movement of troops for any purpose, especially for battle, an impossi bility. Reconnoissances on the 11th and 13th \u2014 the first by Colonel J. G. Mitchell, and the second by Colonel A. G. Mal loy \u2014 developed the fact that infantry could move only with the greatest difficulty upon the surface of the uneven ground. On the 9th, General Thomas ordered General Wilson to move his command to the south side of the river to take position between the Hillsboro and Harding turnpikes, to be in readi ness to participate in the attack, projected for the next clay ; but even this movement could not be executed upon the ice with cavalry, except with horses shod expressly for such a surface. As the refusal of General Thomas to give battle, after a peremptory order on the 6th to attack without waiting VOL. h \u2014 15"], [240, "226 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. longer for a remount for his cavalry, called for the order re lieving him from command, with General Schofield as his suc cessor, so his unwillingness to attack upon the ice first elicited an order from General Grant, on the 11th, to delay no longer for weather or reinforcements, and then another on the 13th, directing Major-General John A. Logan to proceed to Nashville, reporting arrival at Louisville and Nashville. And on the 15th, General Grant reached Washington, on his way to Nashville to take command in person. However, by midday on the 14th, the ice had so far melted that General Thomas resolved upon attacking the enemy the next day, and at 3 p. M. he called together his corps com manders to announce to them his plan of battle, and give them instructions with regard to the specific action of their respective commands in its execution. The following is the text: \"Major-General A. J. Smith, commanding detachment of the Army of the Tennessee, after forming his troops on and nearthe Harding pike in front of his present position, will make a vigorous assault upon the enemy's left. Major-Gen eral Wilson, commanding the cavalry corps Military Division of the Mississippi, with three divisions, will move on and sup port General Smith's right, assisting as far as possible in car rying the left of the enemy's position, and be in readiness to throw his force upon the enemy the moment a favorable opportunity occurs. Major-General Wilson will also send one division on the Charlotte pike, to clear that road of the enemy and observe in the direction of Bell's landing, to protect our right rear until the enemy's position is fairly turned, when it will rejoin the main force. Brigadier-General T. J. Wood, commanding Fourth Corps* after leaving a strong skirmish line in his works from Lawrrens' Hill to his extreme right, will form the remainder of the Fourth Corps on the Hillsboro pike to support General Smith's left, and operate on the left and rear of the enemy's advanced position on Montgomery Hill. Major-General Schofield, commanding Twenty -third Army Corps, will replace Brigadier-General Kimball's di vision of the Fourth Corps with his troops, and occupy the trenches from Fort Negley to Lawrens' Hill with a strong skirmish line. He will move with the remainder of his force * Gen. D. S Stanley was absent on account of wounds received at Franklin."], [241, "BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. 227 in front of the works, and co-operate with General Wood, protecting the latter's left flank against an attack by the enemy. Major-General Steedman, commanding District of Etowah, will occupy the interior line in rear of his present position, stretching from the reservoir on the Cumberland river to Fort Negley, with a strong skirmish line, aud mass the remainder of his force in its present position, to act according to the exigencies which may arise during these operations. Brigadier-General Miller, with troops forming the garrison of Nashville, will occupy the interior line from the battery on hill 210, to the extreme right, including the inclosed work on the Hyde's Ferry road. The quartermaster's troops, under the command of Brigadier-General Donaldson, will, if neces sary, be posted on the interior line from Fort Morton to the battery on hill 210. The troops occupying the interior line will be under the direction of Major-General Steedman, who is charged with the immediate defense of Nashville during the operations around the city. Should the weather permit, the troops will be formed to commence operations at 6 A. M. on the 15th, or as soon thereafter as practicable.\" General Thomas modified this plan, by ordering General Steedman to make a most positive feint against the enemy's right, to divert his attention from the dominant movement against his left, and also by calling General Schofield's corps, first to the reserve, and afterward directing it to move upon General Smith's right, after other movements had been suc cessfully accomplished. The weather and the ice, which from the 9th had prevented General Thomas from assuming the offensive, had also for six days barred all activity on the part of the enemy, who was meditating a movement* round Nashville from the conscious ness that he could not successfully assault the army intrenched before it. The morning of the 15th being favorable for the tactical dispositions required by General Thomas' plan of operations, the two armies were thrown into deadly conflict, * This statement is not supported by official testimony, but upon the declarations of prisoners and citizens within General Hood's lines. Ho, too, was delayed bv the ice-covered ground."], [242, "228 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. to contest not only the possession of Tennessee, but to decide the supremacy of the national arms in all the West. At 4 A. M. on the 15th, the provisional division composed of troops from corps and other organizations of General Sher man's army, under command of Brigadier-General Crust, moved forward and relieved the Fourth and Twenty-third Corps, occupied their exterior line of works, and picketed the front of this line from the Acklin place to Fort Negley, com manding the approaches to the city by the Granny White, Franklin, and Nolensville turnpikes. At the same hour, Gen eral J. F. Miller occupied the works with the garrison of the city, from Fort Negley to the Lebanon turnpike, covering the approaches by the Murfreesboro, Chicken, and Lebanon turn pikes. Brigadier-General Donaldson, with his command, occu pied the defenses from General Crust's right to the Cumber land river, commanding the approaches by the Harding, Hillsboro, and Charlotte turnpikes. General Steedman was instructed to support General Wood's left, wdien his corps should take position, and make a vigorous demonstration in his front to cover the grand effort to turn the enemy's left flank. About daylight the other commands began to move to their several positions as prescribed in the modified plan of battle. General Smith advanced his second division, Brigadier- General Garrard commanding, on the Harding turnpike, and deployed to the left of that road ; he threw forward his first division, Brigadier-General J. McArthur commanding, on the Harding and Charlotte turnpikes, and formed it on the right of Garrard; his third division, Colonel J. B. Moore, Thirty third Wisconsin commanding, he held in reserve opposite the junction of the right and left flanks of the other two divisions. Owing to the divergence of the roads upon which he moved, and the stubborn resistance of the enemy, McArthur did not get into position until 8 a. m. He silenced a batttery, and skirmished heavily as he advanced. General Wood formed the Fourth Corps, with the Second division, Brigadier-General Elliott commanding, on the right ; the First division, Brigadier-General Kimball commanding, in the center; and the third division, Brigadier-General S."], [243, "BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. 229 Beatty commanding, on the left. Elliott's right was refused, in echelon with Smith's left. The other divisions were formed in similar manner \u2014 the right of each in echelon \u2014 to facilitate the wheel of the whole line to the right, on the left of the Fourth Corps as a pivot. The formation of the Fourth Corps was a double battle-line \u2014 the first deployed, and the second in column, by division, opposite the intervals in the first. The front was covered with a line of skirmishers, and a similar force remained in the works in the rear. The Twenty-third Corps, when relieved from position on the left of the Fourth, moved to the right of Wood. The Third division, Brigadier-General J. D. Cox commanding, excepting one brigade left to support General Steedman, moved by the Hillsboro turnpike, and formed in the rear of Elliott's right ; the Second (recently General Ruger's), Major- General D. 'N. Couch commanding, advanced on the Harding turnpike, and took position in rear of Garrard's left. When the infantry on the right had given room for the movements of the cavalry, General Wilson at once assumed position. The Fifth division, Brigadier-General E. Hatch commanding, took position on the right of McArthur, of Smith's corps. General Croxton, with his brigade of the First division, formed on the right of Hatch. The Seventh divis ion, one brigade mounted, Brigadier J. F. Knipe commanding, was held in reserve, to render aid wherever emergency might demand. The Sixth division, Brigadier R. W. Johnson com manding, one brigade mounted, was ordered to move by the Charlotte turnpike, to clear that road of the enemy, and keep ing connection with Croxton by skirmishers or patrols, to push as far as Davidson's house, eight miles from the city, so as to cover the remainder of the corps from the enemy's cavalry, and look well to the guns of the enemy at Bell's landing, commanding the Cumberland river, and the force supporting them. A dense fog hung over the two armies during the early morning, which, with the undulations of the ground, con cealed the movements of the national army, though from these causes the evolutions were also greatly retarded. When, about noon, the fog lifted, there was doubtless to General"], [244, "230 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. Hood an unexpected revelation. He had thus far in the cam paign monopolized the offensive, and during the days of en forced inaction, he had been maturing his plans to turn Nashville and move into Kentucky. This would have been au exceedingly rash adventure, and after his experience at Franklin, where three divisions beat back his army, with the help of extemporized intrenchments, he could not, even in the wildest forecast of the consequences of an attempt to carry Nashville, with its elaborate fortifications, held by an army of equal strength, decide to take such a risk. Neither could he stay long before the city, and supply his army. It was imperative that he should move in some direction, and in his desperate extremity, he no doubt meditated an early advance into Kentucky, hoping, despite all the dangerous contin gencies, that he could at least escape destruction. He had not anticipated the necessity of so soon acting on the defen sive, and even when he saw an army deployed before him in aggressive attitude, he did not expect an attack upon his left flank. The troops opposite his right, during the twelve days of his nominal investment, alone had made the pretense of aggression, in contesting the defenses which General Steedman had constructed when he was before Wilson, on the left of the national line. And now, while the strength of the Army of the Cumberland was on his left, he was to be still further misled by a feint, which, from its spirit and force, might easily be mistaken for a positive assault. When the combinatipn to turn General Hood's left had been fully completed, Brigadier-General Whipple, chief of staff to General Thomas, bore an order to General Steedman to advance against his right, in semblance of actual assault. General Steedman had previously formed a column for this movement, composed of three strong detachments \u2014 the first under Colonel T. J. Morgan, embracing his own regiment, the Fourteenth Colored, the Seventeenth, Forty-fourth, and a detachment of the Eighteenth; the second under Colonel Thompson, including his own regiment, the Twelfth Colored, and the Thirteenth and One Hundredth; and the third under Lieutenant-Colonel Grosvenor, of the Eighteenth Ohio, com posed of his regiment, the Sixty-eighth Indiana, and the Sec-"], [245, "BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. 231 ond battalion of the Fourteenth Army Corps ; and in addi tion, the Eighteenth Ohio and Twentieth Indiana batteries. At 8 A. m. the detachments of Morgan and Grosvenor, the former commanding both, moved forward from the Murfrees boro turnpike to Riddle's hill, drove in the enemy's pickets, and assaulted his works, between the turnpike and the Nashville and Chattanooga railroad. These troops gained a lodgment in the works, but were exposed, while holding them, to a se vere fire from General Hood's massed forces on that flank, and General Steedman withdrew them. The charge was so gallantly made, that General Hood was so deceived as to its ultimate aim, that he drew troops from his center and left to give strength to his seemingly endangered flank. Soon after this action on the extreme left, the forces on the opposite flank moved forward on the Harding and Hillsboro roads with resistless force, in executing the grand initiative of the battle. McArthur's division moved rapidly behind its skirmishers, who were soon sharply engaged, and gradually wheeling to the left, the direction of the line, was parallel to the Harding road. Advancing thence a short distance, the division was before a detached earthwork of the enemy, situ- ated on the top of a hill, and inclosing four brass guns. This fort was covered by a stronger one, some four hundred feet to the right, and containing the same number of guns. In the meantime, Hatch's division of cavalry, with its left connected with McArthur's right, had swept round on a longer curve and was in readiness to co-operate in assaulting the forts. Hatch had previously engaged Ecton's brigade of infantry beyond Richland creek, and had driven it past Harding's house, near which Colonel Spalding, commanding the Twelfth Tennessee Cavalry, charged and captured forty-three prisoners and the headquarter-train of Chalmers' division. Hatch's right bri- gade, under Colonel Coon, having diverged too far from the direction of the general movement, was now moved by the left flank till it joined his other brigade on the flank of the four-gun redoubt, which covered the extremity of the enemy's line. Here, by direction of General Hatch, Coon's brigade dismounted to charge, planting its battery \u2014 \" I,\" First Illinois Artillery \u2014 so as to enfilade the enemy's line. Four batteries"], [246, "232 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. then opened upon the guns in the redoubt and soon silenced them, and Coon's brigade charged the supporting infantry force, and though under the fire of the second redoubt, cap tured the four guns. The skirmishers of McMillen's and Ilub bard's brigades of McArthur's division were also charging from an opposite direction, and entering the redoubt at the same moment contributed to the successful issue. One hun dred and fifty prisoners were taken with the guns. The two divisions immediately moved to the right, cavalry and infantry vieing with each other in the effort to carry the stronger redoubt on a hill whose acclivity greatly increased the hazard of an assault. This position, however, was carried in the same manner as the other. Coon's brigade, armed with the Spencer rifle, supported by two fresh brigades, charged up the hill and drove the enemy from position ; while Mc- Arthur's brigades were in such close proximity, in a sweeping charge, as to lay claim to the guns and two hundred and fifty prisoners. During these successful movements, by the direction of Gen eral Thomas, General Schofield moved his corps to the right of General Smith, and formed it for battle. This change be came necessary, as the latter had moved farther to the left than had been anticipated, and the enemy's true flank had not been found. General Schofield was directed to attack his flank, which rested upon a group of hills near the Hillsboro turnpike, that the cavalry might operate in his rear. In order to preserve continuity of line, General Smith threw Ward's brigade of his reserve division to the front, to fill a space of a half mile between his right and Schofield's left ; and to give full space to General Schofield, General Hatch moved to the right, across the Hillsboro turnpike, and with his other bri gade attacked the enemy on another range of hills, drove him from it, and captured a battery in the valley beyond. In the meantime, Generals Schofield and Smith advanced their lines. Colonel Hill's brigade of McArthur's division carried a small earthwork containing two guns, but lost its commander in the assault. Colonel Wolf's brigade of Garrard's division crossed the Hillsboro turnpike and gained the works on the left. General Schofield moved to the right of the two redoubts first"], [247, "233 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. captured, crossed the Hillsboro road and a valley beyond, and carried a series of hills overlooking the Granny White turn pike \u2014 one of the two remaining lines of retreat available to the enemy. The charge was made by General Cooper's bri gade of Couch's division. The enemy here made his first attempt on his left to give a counter-blow. He had previously massed a heavy force on his left to hurl it against General Thomas' right flank. When General Cooper had crossed the valley to carry the hills beyond, this force appeared in his rear in the low ground. General Couch then sent Mehringer's brigade against it, and though the enemy was of superior strength, Colonel Mehringer checked him until Doolittle's and Casement's brigades of Cox's division advanced in his sup port. The engagement was continued with sharp fighting until dark. The action of the Fourth Corps was equally successful. As soon as General Smith became engaged on General Wood's right, the latter moved his corps toward Montgomery Hill, the salient of the enemy's defensive line. This position was very strong, being an irregular cone rising about ohe hundred feet above the general level of the country. The ascent, except on the left and rear, is quite abrupt, and was covered with forest trees. The intrenchments concealed the hill a little below the crest, and the approaches were covered with abatis and sharp- ened stakes firmly planted in the ground. During the forma- tion of the corps for assault, the guns in position expressed defiance, and in resj)onse and menace General Wood's guns opened with vigor. As the corps advanced, it swung to the left, in order that the more easy ascent should be in front of Beatty's division, which had been required to furnish an assaulting column, of which Colonel Post's brigade was desig nated for the front and Colonel Streight's for immediate sup port. At 1 p. m. Colonel Post dashed up the hill and over the intrenchments on the summit, and held the enemy's stronghold This action was anterior to the more positive success of Smith and Wilson on the right, and opened the way for General Scho field to move to the right of General Smith. When the Twenty third Corps was transferred to the right, General Thomas di rected General Wood to throw his reserves on his right, to extend"], [248, "234 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. his line to as great an extent as was compatible with the se curity of his front. In obedience, General Wood put the re serve brigade of each division on his right, and then engaged the enemy with his entire corps. He brought three batteries into play and pressed forward a strong skirmish line, but at first made no threat of assaulting. Soon, however, he made preparations to carry the enemy's works in his front; moving his right division, whose right had extended in rear of General Smith's left, farther to his own left, and then advanced it and his central division, so as to bring Kimball's division opposite a fortified hill near the center of General Hood's main line. Placing two batteries so as to throw a converging fire upon the hill, he used them vigorously for an hour, and then ordered General Kimball to charge with his whole division. With loud cheers, the division ascended the hill and leaped over the in trenchments, capturing several pieces of artillery, stands of colors, and a large number of prisoners. At the same time, General Elliott carried the intrenchments in his front, and Gen eral Beatty crowned the enemy's works before his division with captures of artillery and prisoners. In this general advance, the right of General Wood's line became involved with the left of General Smith's, and conflicting claims for the fruits of victory were preferred. At 5 p. m. General Wood received an order from General Thomas to move to the Franklin turnpike, two and a half miles distant, and facing southward, to drive the enemy across it. The corps moved as directed, but the night fell too soon for it to reach its destination, but it bivou acked on a line parallel to the Granny White turnpike con necting with General Smith's left. On the extreme left, other advantages were gained after the feint of the morning. Colonels Morgan and Grosvenor pressed the enemy from Raine's house and held the position, using the buildings for defense. Colonel Thompson, with his detachment, advanced across Brown's creek, between the Murfreesboro and Nolensville turnpikes, and carried the left of the front line of fortifications on the latter road, holdimr his ground firmly. In this succession of aggressive movements, the colored troops were prominent and successful. During the day the enemy had been driven from his original"], [249, "BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. 235 line of works, and forced back to a position on the Harpeth hills, and his left had been completely turned, though he still held two lines of retreat \u2014 one on the Granny White road, and the other on the direct road to Franklin. Seventeen pieces of artillery had been taken from him, also twelve hundred pris oners and several hundred small arms. The cavalry had cleared its front, covered the extremity of the infantry line, enveloped the enemy's left flank and taken it in reverse, and had only failed in the extreme possibility of reaching the Franklin turn pike in rear of Hood's army. General Wilson at dark directed General Hatch to bivouac on the Hillsboro road, to cover Gen eral Smith's right flank. He placed General Knipe's division on Hatch's right ; Hammond's brigade had reached the six mile post on the Hillsboro road, and turned thence up a branch of Richland creek for three miles, bivouacking on the Granny White turnpike. General Johnson's division had moved far to the right during the day, to co-operate with the gunboats in dislodging the enemy from Bell's landing, and bivouacked in the vicinity, in prospect of co-operating with Lieutenant- Commander Fitch in an attack the next morning. General Croxton had moved on Johnson's left for several miles, and having turned to the left, rested for the night at the six-mile post on the Charlotte turnpike. The brigade of dismounted cavalry took position on the Hillsboro turnpike, to cover Hatch and Hammond against a possible advance of the enemy's cav alry on that road. The whole army bivouacked with assurance of complete victory on the morrow. The authorities at Washington and the people of the country, after ten days of impatience at General Thomas' delay in preparation for a battle now so glori ously begun, were in full sympathy with the troops lying on their arms before the defeated enemy. General Grant, on his way to Nashville from City Point, Virginia, stopped at Wash ington, while General Logan, farther advanced toward the same destination, halted at Louisville. Official congratu lations from the President, Secretary of War, and Lieutenant- General sped their swift way to General Thomas and his army. The defeat, total and immediate, of one of the two great armies upon which the existence of the rebellion depended"], [250, "236 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. was now assured, and the reaction from the historic uneas iness which had obtained throughout the country with re gard to the situation at Nashville to the extreme of hope fulness with respect to the immediate issue and the ultimate consequences of the battle, was one of the most marked revul sions of opinion and feeling during the war. The army had felt no uneasiness, and now looked forward with calm as surance to the result which had been anticipated during all the days of peparation for battle. During the night, General Hood drew back his center and right to a stronger position, his right then i-estingon Overton hill, and his left remaining on the Harpeth or Brentwood range. His line extended along the base of the hills, his artil lery was massed at points most available for its effective use, and his troops spent the night in fortifying the position. The battle-front now presented by the enemy was on its left nearly perpendicular in trend to the right of the national line, the latter having so far wheeled to the left that its direction was nearly at right angles to its original linear course. This rela tion of the army lines made General Schofield fearful with re gard to his right flank, and during the night he requested re inforcements from General Smith, who sent to him Colonel Moore's division. Before daylight, Colonel Moore was in re serve on General Schofield's right. As General Hood's retreat was now probable, General Thomas gave orders for movements on the 16th having ref erence to attack should he accept battle, and to pursuit should he retreat. Each corps was ordered to move forward rapidly at 6 a. m. until the enemy should be met. As General Hood's left remained in proximity to General Schofield's line, he did not move early in the morning. The Fourth Corps advanced promptly as ordered toward the Franklin road. The enemy's skirmishers were soon encountered, but were speedily driven back, and the Franklin road was gained. Here the corps was deployed \u2014 Elliott's division across the road facing southward, Beatty's on the left, and Kimball's in reserve behind Elliott. It then advanced rapidly three-fourths of a mile, and met a strong skirmish line behind barricades, the main line being plainly in view a half mile beyond. Simultaueously with the"], [251, "237 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. movement of the Fourth Corps, General Steedmau advanced on the left, and General Smith on the right. The former soon found that the enemy had left his front, and pressing forward, took position between the Nolensville turnpike and General Wood's left, his own right resting on the railroad, and his left on the Nolensville road. To cover his rear against dashes of cavalry, he ordered Mitchell's brigade of Crust's division from the defenses, to occupy Riddle's hill. General Smith ad vanced with two divisions, Garrard's and McArthur's, going into position under the fire of the enemy's artillery, about eight hundred yards from his main line. The Twenty-third Corps was still at right angles with this his new offensive line, facing eastward. General Smith's right was opposite very strong intrenchments of the enemy \u2014 in fact, was at the base of the hill upon which they rested. He simply held position until 1 p. m., waiting for General Schofield, who was to take the initiative againt General Hood's left. There being an in terval between his left and General Wood's right, the latter threw into it Kimball's division, and completed the continuous alignment of the infantry from left to right. In the meantime, the artillery from all parts of the line kept up a measured fire, and even muskets were used freely to induce the enemy to ex pend his limited ammunition. Pending the movements of the infantry to perfect their array, General Wilson was active in the formation of the cav alry on the right. Early in the morning, Hammond's pickets! on the Granny White turnpike had been attacked and driven back ; but in compliance with orders, General Hammond had strengthed his line aud regained his position. During this action, Hatch's division had been directed to the enemy's rear, passing to Hammond's left. The country being hilly and covered with a dense forest, was impracticable for the move ment of cavalry, mounted, and hence the whole force was dis mounted and pushed forward. General Croxton moved to the front to support either Hatch or Hammond, and General Johnson, who had ascertained early in the morning that the enemy had abandoned Bell's landing, had been ordered to move across to the Hillsboro turnpike. By noon, the cavalry"], [252, "238 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. formed a continuous line from General Schofield's right to the Granny White turnpike. General Thomas' object now was to turn both flanks of the enemy. His flanks were stronger than his center, but success in turning either or both prom ised better results than to break through his center, as they covered his lines of retreat. Could one or the other be turned, there was the possibility of reaching his rear and cutting off his retreat, and could both be turned at once, he would be thrown in confusion on his only line of retreat through the Brentwood Pass, and the probability would be doubly strong of cutting him off. Having rode along his liue from Wood to Schofield, he ordered the latter and Smith to attack the enemy's left, and the former and Steedman to move against Overton hill. The Brentwood hills, rising about three hundred and fifty feet above the level of the country, consist of two ranges trending from their northernmost summits, on the one hand to the southeast, and on the other to the southwest, and ter minating on opposite sides of the Brentwood Pass, through which the direct road to Franklin courses, and situated about nine miles from Nashville. These hills were the background for .General Hood's army ; his battle line coursed over the detached hills in front, covered in great part with native for ests. Overton hill commanded the Franklin turnpike, run ning along its base, and was intrenched around its northern slope, half-way from base to summit, with a flank running round its eastern descent, and the approaches were obstructed by abatis and other entanglements. This position was ex ceedingly strong, and the troops holding it had been heavily reinforced during the forenoon. General Wood sent Colonel Post to reconnoiter the position, who reported that the northern slope was most favorable for assault. As before, his brigade was chosen to form the head of the assaulting column, with Streight's in support. General Steedman designated Thompson's brigade of colored troops, and Grosvenor's, to co-operate in the assault. As preparatory to the advance of these columns, Major Goodspeed, chief of artillery of the Fourth Corps, was ordered to pour a converg ing fire upon the enemy's batteries, and continue it as long as it could be done with safety to the advancing troops. At 3"], [253, "239 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. p. M. the assaulting columns moved up the steep ascent, cov ered with a strong line of skirmishers, to draw the enemy's fire and annoy his gunners. The instructions required that the columns should move steadily until near the intrench ments, and then to dash up the ascent and leap the abatis and parapets. The movement promised success until the moment of final issue. The leading men in each column reached the parapets, and a few had gained the works, when the enemy's reserves opened a fire so destructive as to drive back both lines with heavy loss. The colored soldiers suffered equally with the veteran white troops, and with them shared the glory of a gallant but unsuccessful assault. The survivors were reformed at the base of the hill, in readiness for another attack ; but Colonel Post was not for the third time to lead, as had received a severe wound. The advance on the right soon followed the attack upon Overton hill. It had been anticipated that the Twenty-third Corps, facing east, would first advance ; but there was so much delay that General McArthur requested permission to carry the strong position before him and General Schofield equally, and although General Thomas desired him to wait until he could hear from General Schofield, and went himself to the right, McArthur, fearing that an opportunity would be lost, directed Colonel McMillen to charge with his brigade and take by storm, the hill upon which rested the left flank of the main line of the enemy. McMillen was directed to ascend from the west, while the other brigades of the division should attack in front, when he should be half-way up to the summit. Colonel McMillen ordered his men to refrain from firing a shot, and from all cheering, until they had gained the works. The One hundred and Fourteenth Illinois, Ninth Indiana, and Eighth Minnesota formed his first line, and the Seventy-second Indiana and the Ninety -fifth Ohio his second. A heavy line of skirmishers moved rapidly forward, and as it advanced, the artillery, in sympathy, gave roar after roar with quick repeti- tion, while between these sheets of flame and smoke, in the stern silence of desperate valor, the brigade moved up the hill. Hubbard, \" eager'in emulation,\" started directly up, followed by Hill's brigade with another leader, and all by Garrard's"], [254, "240 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. division. The enemy opened with musketry, and the death dealing short-range missiles of his artillery ; but on, without halt or waver, moved the columns, and soon the position was carried, with three general officers and a large number of lower grades, and a corresponding number of men as prisoners, and twenty-seven pieces of artillery, and twelve stands of colors. The shout of these divisions in victory called forth responsive cheers from those charging on right and left. Wilson, with his dismounted troopers, swept eastward, and, with Coon's brigade, gained the hill, against which the Twenty third Corps was advancing. Soon after, Doolittle's brigade of Cox's division crowned a fortified position on the right of the salient of the enemy's left flank, the division capturing eight guns and from two hundred and fifty to three hundred pris oners. The noise of Smith's victory moved Wood and Steed man. to renew their assault upon Overton hill \u2014 their entire commands rushing forward and sweeping all before them, on the summit and beyond as they moved in rapid pursuit. Beatty's division crowned the hill, and captured four pieces of artillery, a large number of prisoners, and two stands of colors ; Kimball's cleared the intrenchments in its front, and captured a large number of prisoners and small arms ; and Elliott's car ried the line throughout its front, and captured five guns and several hundred prisoners and small arms. This general charge was resistless, and the enemy was hurled from every position in utter rout and demoralization. The success of the first day was the inspiration of the second, and officers and men vied with each other in personal daring and persist ent, steady courage. General Hood must have regarded his second position stronger than his first, or he would not have attempted to hold it, for all other conditions of the second battle were much more unfavorable to successful resistance than those of the first. The prestige was with the national army, and, on the second day of his last battle, he ought to have known that a victorious iniatitive by a Northern army had more significance than when attained by a Southern one. The Northern armies seldom lost a battle which had a prom ising beginning, and they often gained them, after the South ern people had been electrified by the rash assumption of vie-"], [255, "BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. 241 tory by their generals, when afterward, on the same field, their initial success was turned into positive defeat, by the pluck and persistence of Northern soldiers. When General Wilson's command had gained their saddles, which unfortunately was delayed in consequence of the fact, that they had gone far from their horses, as those leading them made slow progress over the broken ground and dense forests, Hatch and Knipe hurried in pursuit. General Hatch was di rected to move on the Granny White road and make effort to reach the Franklin turnpike that night. He had, however, proceeded but a short distance, when he met Chalmers' divis ion, strongly posted across the road behind a barricade of rails. Dismounting a portion of his command, he deployed on both sides of the road. While his skirmishers were advancing, Colonel Spalding charged, broke the line, and scattered the force in all directions, capturing Brigadier-General Rucker, for the time in command of the division. The cavalry then bivouacked for the night \u2014 Hatch, Knipe, and Croxton on the Granny White road, and Johnson on the Hillsboro road, near the Harpeth river. The Fourth Corps followed the enemy on the Franklin turnpike, and the frequent discharges of its artillery increased the confusion of the retreat. At dark the corps bivouacked a mile from the village of Brentwood. The line of retreat revealed the fact that General Hood's army had abandoned itself to a most disorderly withdrawal. Small arms and ac couterments were strewn thickly along the road, while no effort was made to carry off the wounded or dispose of the dead. The army was not only defeated, but it was broken and crushed, and had the conditions of pursuit proved favor able, even the fragments would have been gathered in capture. The action of the 15th removed from all in the North the fear of disaster at Nashville, or the invasion of Kentucky. That of the 16th announced the overthrow of the rebellion in the West, and foretold its speedy utter annihilation. There was now no formidable Confederate army between the Missis sippi river and \"Virginia. One of the two armies, upon whose organic life, strength and activity the rebellion rested, was vol. H \u2014 16"], [256, "242 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. fleeing southward in disorganization and dismay. On no other field of the war had two armies of equal proportions fought with similar issue. Drawn battle or indecisive victory had usually resulted. But now, the Confederate Army of the Tennessee, which had fought with historic honor at Donel son, Shiloh, Perryville, Murfreesboro, Chickamauga, Lookout Mountain, Missionary Ridge, Resaca, New Hope Church, Kenesaw Mountain, Peachtree Creek, Atlanta, Jonesboro, in all the minor battles of \" the hundred days under fire,\" and at Franklin and Nashville, found its grave on a field in close proximity to its first line of defense. Neither was its demor alization rife before its last conflict. There were too many officers and men captured with swords, guns, and colors, within their intrenchments, to warrant the supposition that this his toric army, with its traditions of valor and unity on every previous field, came far north in the mere semblance of the boldest aggression, to throw down its arms in shameless dis regard of its glorious antecedents. There was, indeed, less loss of life to the victors than usual, but may not this result find explanation in the nice adjustment of strategic and tac tical combinations and the almost unprecedented vigor of as sault. Successful assaults are never as costly as those which fail, all other things being equal. Thompson's brigade of colored troops lost twenty-five per cent, of its strength in thirty minutes, on the slope of Overton hill ; but had not the gallant leader of the main column fallen at the critical mo ment when a leader's presence and heroism is the ruling condi tion of successful assault, the soldiers who fell on the parapets and within the enemy's lines might have lived to plant their banners in room of those of treason and rebellion. The story is half told, and the philosophy of the victory is half revealed, by the declaration of a captured general officer, \" that powder and lead were inadequate to resist such a charge.\" The other half of the history of the- battle, and the cause of victory, come to light in the palpable co-operation of the chief sub ordinates with the commander-in-chief in the execution of a definite plan of battle, and the personal supervision of the vital movements by General Thomas. There were no exposed flanks, and no opportunities for stunning offensive returns."], [257, "243 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. There was only one unsuccessful assault, and that was upon the strongest position of the enemy, manned by the heaviest concentration on his line. No battle of the war manifests more complete prevision of contingencies, or more full pro vision for emergencies and possibilities. This battle moved on gloriously from its initial feint to the final charge, in the revelation of the highest type of generalship and the highest martial virtues of an entire army. Its immediate fruits were four thousand four hundred and sixty-two prisoners, including one major-general and three brigadiers, and two hundred and eighty officers of lower grades, all the wounded upon the field, fifty-three pieces of artillery, thousands of small arms, and twenty -five battle-flags. General Thomas and the officers and men of his army were fully alive to the importance of vigorous pursuit. But it had been impossible to make full preparations before the battle, and the bridges on the line of retreat being at the mercy of the enemy, the difficulties in prospect were by no means slight. It was the season of rain, and there were bad roads, and the rivers and creeks which crossed the line of pursuit were full, as well as bridgeless in prospect. In the conduct of the pur suit, General Thomas was put under orders and exhortations, as he had previously been to fight the battle before he con sidered himself prepared and the conditions promising. During the evening of the 16th, he gave orders for the move ments of the next day, and in one single direction to a staff officer he failed to express what he intended. Being roused from rest in his tent, by an officer who was to receive instruc tions regarding the movement of the pontoon train, he di rected it upon the Murfreesboro road instead of the one to Franklin. He did not discover his mistake until the next morning, when he asked as he was riding on the latter road, if the train had passed to the front. It was immediately re called from the wrong road, and hurried forward, but never theless a serious delay resulted. Having given orders for the care of the wounded, and the collection of the captured and abandoned property, General Thomas commenced the pursuit early in the morning of the 17th. The Fourth Corps pushed on to Franklin through"], [258, "244 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. Brentwood, and the cavalry followed the Granny White road to the junction of the two roads, and then General Wilson hurried past the infantry. In moving upon Franklin, General Wilson kept General Knipe's command on the direct road, and sent Generals Hatch and Croxton to cross the Harpeth above the town. General Knipe found the enemy strongly posted at Hollow Tree Gap, four miles north of Franklin, and charging him, front and flank, carried the position, and captured four hun dred and thirteen men and three flags. At Franklin, he again made a show of resistance, but upon Johnson's approach on the south bank of the river, he retreated toward Columbia. Beyond the town, Generals Knipe and Hatch moved in par allel columns on the Columbia and Carter's Creek roads, while Johnson followed Knipe, and Croxton advanced on the Lewis burg road. The extreme flanking columns were instructed to press round the flanks of the enemy's rear-guard, composed almost entirely of infantry, while a strong line of skirmishers should attack in the rear \u2014 the object being to break up the last organized force which was covering the fugitive and broken columns in rapid retreat. This rear-guard, however, proved very efficient and subtle, preventing any successful flanking, and skirmishing with spirit in the rear, while moving rapidly. Late in the evening, the enemy took a strong posi tion in the open field, about one mile from the West Harpeth. The rapid movement of the cavalry had thrown them into some confusion and intervolution with the enemy, which, with the fog and falling darkness, caused some doubt as to the fact that the force in front was the rear-guard of the enemy. The consequent hesitation gave the enemy opportunity to form his line and post his batteries. As soon as the true state of affairs was ascertained, General Wilson ordered Hatch and Knipe to charge both flanks. The batteries from both sides opened briskly, when Lieutenant Hedges, commanding the Fourth United States Cavalry, with his regiment in column by fours, dashed forward in a saber charge, and broke through the battery. Hatch's division and Hammond's brigade, dismounted, charged at the same time, and the enemy was completely routed. Lieutenant Hedges was three times captured, but"], [259, "245 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. escaped at last. The pursuit was vigorous, notwithstanding the darkness. General Hatch, with the Tenth Indiana Cav alry, forded the West Harpeth, and struck the enemy in flank. Being pressed on all sides, the enemy abandoned his guns, and fled in disorder, under cover of the darkness. This rear guard was Stevenson's division of Lee's corps, under Forrest. The Fourth Corps reached Franklin a little after noon, but the river had risen so rapidly after the cavalry had crossed, that the infantry were delayed to extemporize a bridge. Gen eral Steedman followed General Wood, and encamped near by on the north bank of the Harpeth ; the other two corps were in the rear. Trains followed, with rations for ten days, and a hundred rounds of ammunition to each man. Early on the 18th, General Wilson pursued and endeavored, with Johnson's and Croxton's commands, to strike the enemy at Spring Hill, but he had passed on over Rutherford's creek, destroying the bridges behind him. The roads, even the turn pikes, had become exceedingly bad from the heavy rains and their use by the enemy, and in consequence the pursuit was greatly retarded. General Wood crossed the Harpeth in the morning, and joined General Wilson at night at Rutherford's creek. The difficulties of the pursuit were now fully apparent, and anticipating the failure of all efforts to intercept Hood's army with his own in direct advance, General Thomas, on the 18th, ordered General Steedman to march his command to Murfrees boro ; that passing through Stevenson by rail, he should take the troops of Ge'neral R. S. Granger, including the former gar risons of Huntsville, Athens, and Decatur, and proceed to the latter place. His instructions required that he should re occupy the important posts on that line, abandoned at the time of General Hood's advance, and with the remainder of his forces cross the Tennessee river, and threaten the enemy's com munications west of Florence. On the morning of the 19th, Generals Wilson and Wood advanced to Rutherford's creek, whose deep swift current formed a better rear-guard for the enemy than his dispirited infantry and cavalry. During the day, several efforts were made to cross the stream, but all were fruitless. The rain con-"], [260, "246 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. tinued and the pontoon train was still in the rear. While the leading columns were thus detained, General Smith reached Spring Hill, and General Schofield crossed the Harpeth at Franklin. The next morning, General Hatch formed a floating bridge from the debris of the railroad bridge, and crossing with his division advanced rapidly to Columbia, to find that the enemy had succeeded, the evening previous, in passing Duck river and lifting his pontoon bridge. General Wood also crossed by various expedients and encamped near Columbia. The pontoon train reached Rutherford's creek at noon on the 21st. A bridge was immediately thrown, and the troops and trains passed over and moved to Columbia. The weather now changed from excessive rain to extreme cold ; and this greatly retarded the throwing of the bridge over Duck river. The rapid subsidence of the water caused repeated alterations in the length of the bridge, and protracted the delay. Gen eral Wood, however, crossed in the evening of the 23d, and encamped two miles south of Columbia. The cavalry crossed the next day and the pursuit was resumed ; but by this time General Hood had reformed his rear-guard, and this accom plishment was one of the conditions of his escape. All his best troops had been thrown to his rear, and the interval between his disorganized forces and their pursuers had been greatly increased. Such, too, was the topography of the coun try, that a small force could compel the deployment of the leading troops, with loss of time. Another difficulty was the impossibility of moving the cavalry off the turnpike on the flanks of the infantry column, as General Thomas had directed, on account of the softness of the soil. As a consequence, the infantry fell in rear of the cavalry ; and in this order Gen erals Wilson and Wood moved toward Pulaski. The former encountered the enemy in the vicinity of Lynnville, and the country being open he was driven rapidly. At Buford's Sta tion, while Hatch was pressing directly forward, Croxton struck the enemy's flank, when he was thrown into rapid retreat, A number of prisoners were captured, and General Buford was wounded. The enemy moved hurriedly through Pulaski, closely sol-"], [261, "247 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. lowed by Colonel Harrison's brigade. Harrison's quick move ment compelled the enemy to leave the bridge over Richland creek, and hurrying forward he found him intrenched at the head of a ravine through which the road passed. Here his infantry leaped quickly from the intrenchments, brushed back Harrison's skirmishers, and captured one gun of Smith's bat tery \u2014 \"I,\" Fourth United States Artillery. The enemy retained the gun, but left fifty prisoners when Hatch and Hammond moved upon his flanks. On the 26th, the pursuit was continued to Sugar creek, where the enemy was again found in intrenchments, but which he abandoned upon the development of a line of attack. Here the pursuit was abandoned, as it had been ascertained that General Hood's infantry forces had effected the passage of the Tennessee river at Bainbridge. The gunboats under Admiral Lee had reached Chickasaw, Mississippi, on the 24th, and soon after captured two guns from a battery at Florence. General Steedman reached Decatur on the 28th, having met resistance in crossing the river at that place. When the pursuit terminated, General Thomas gave orders for the disposition of his forces in winter cantonments, on the line of the Tennessee river, having ulterior aggressive aims. His orders located the Fourth Corps at Huntsville and Athens, Alabama ; the Twenty -third Corps at Dalton, Georgia ; General Smith's corps at East-port, Mississippi, and General Wilson's cavalry at Huntsville and Eastport. On the 30th, he an nounced in orders the conclusion of the campaign, and con gratulated his army upon its eminent success. This was the last invasion of the State of Tennessee by the Confederate Army of the Tennessee, composed largely of troops from that state, many of whom, in the final rout, scat tered in all directions, and never again stood under their ban ners. Indeed, the banners of this army, as such, were never again borne in battle. Exclusive of the multitudes who wan dered from his army, General Hood lost by capture thirteen thousand one hundred and eighty-nine men, including seven general officers, sixteen colonels, and nearly one thousand of lower grades, and two thousand by formal desertion. He lost seventy -two pieces of serviceable artillery, seventy stands of"], [262, "248 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. colors, and immense quantities of small arms, wagons, pon toons, and other material. If, to the fifteen thousand men reported as prisoners and deserters, there should be added his losses in battle and the never-reported desertions, it is safe to conclude that scarcely one-half of his army recrossed the Tennessee river. The portion of it which did cross, was too dispirited to give further support to the sinking cause. In the whole campaign, General Thomas lost, in all the forms of casualty, about ten thousand men, a large portion of this aggregate having been slightly wounded. This campaign, as also the Atlanta campaign, had intimate relations with the operations of General Canby on the Missis sippi river. Twice had the Confederate President ordered the armies under Generals Smith and Magruder, west of the great river, to cross to the east \u2014 once to aid General Johnston against General Sherman, and again, to join General Hood in his projected advance through Kentucky. General Canby 's success in preventing the transfer of these forces in the two cases, eliminated from each the ruling condition of success. He achieved this result by holding the best crossings with strong detachments, and keeping a floating army, in con junction with the gunboat fleet, in constant motion up and down the river. Nashville, November 29, 1864. Major-General Steedman, Stevenson: Your dispatch of 11.30 A. M. to-day received. Concentrate your troops at Cowan, as previously directed, and if the enemy moves over to the N. & C. railroad, act according to instructions given 'in my telegram of the 25th. When General Smith arrives, and he begins to push the enemy back, you can then proceed to execute the Tuscumbia expedition. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. Nashville, November 30, 1864 \u2014 3 p. M. Admiral S. P. Lee : As soon as the iron-clads return to Paducah, please order them into the Cumberland river, to patrol that river and convoy transports up and down. Hood at present has a cavalry force so much larger than mine that I have been compelled to fall back and concentrate on Nashville. But as soon as I can get my cavalry back from Louisville, I feel confident I can drive him back. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding."], [263, "BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. 249 Nashville, December 1, 1864 \u2014 9.30 p. m. Admiral S. P. Lee : Your communication by Commander Fitch and telegram of 1 p. m., this date are received, and I am much indebted to you for having changed the destination of the iron-clads. Commander Fitch thinks if the iron clads you expect at Smithland were stationed at Clarksville, the river then would be made perfectly safe. Will you please order them to Clarksville? GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. Nashville, December 3, 1864. Admiral S. P. Lee, Mound City Your telegram of yesterday received last night. My force of cavalry and infantry at Franklin being so much less than that of the enemy, I determined to fall back to this place to concentrate my infantry and give time to General Wilson to arm and equip sufficient cavalry to meet For rest. I have here now nearly as much infantry as Hood, and in a few days hope to have cavalry enough to enable me to assume the offensive. In the meantime, Captain Fitch has cheerfully complied with my request to patrol the river above and below the city. I am therefore in hopes we shall, in a few days, be able to take the offensive on pretty even terms with the enemy. I regret much that my telegram of the 30th implied an order to you, which was not intended. With many thanks for your previous prompt co-operations, I am, yours truly, GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. Headquarters Department of the Cumberland, December 9, 1864. Major-General J. M. Schofield, Commanding Twenty-third Army Corps : Owing to the severity of the storm raging to-day, it is found necessary to postpone the operations designed for to-morrow morning until the breaking up of the storm. I desire, however, that everything be put in condition to carry out the plan contemplated as soon as the weather will permit it to be done, so that we can act instantly when the storm clears away. Acknowledge receipt. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. Sent to Major-General A. J. Smith, commanding detachment Army of Tennessee; Major-General J. B.

I would like your opinion about it. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. Nashville, December 11, 1864. Major-Generals Schofield, Steedman, Smith, and Brigadier-General Wood: Have your commands put in readiness to-morrow for operations. I wish to see you at my headquarters at 3 p. m. to-morrow. Acknowledge receipt. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. Nashville, December 1, 1864 \u2014 9.30 P. M Major-General Halleck, Washington, D. C. : After General Schofield's fight of yesterday, feeling convinced that the enemy very far outnumbered him both in infantry and cavalry, I deter mined to retire to the fortifications around Nashville, until General Wilson can get his cavalry equipped. He has now but about one-fourth the number of the enemy, and consequently is no match for him. I have two iron-clads here with several gunboats, and Commander Fitch assures me that Hood can neither cross the Cumberland nor blockade it. I therefore think it best to wait here until Wilson can equip all his cavalry. If Hood attacks me here, he will be more seriously damaged than he was yesterday. If he remains until AVilson gets equipped, I can whip him, and will move against him at once. I have Murfreesboro strongly held, and therefore feel easy in regard to its safety. Chattanooga, Bridgeport, Stevenson, and Elk river bridges have strong garrisons. (Signed,) GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. War Department, Washington, December 2 \u2014 10.30 a. m. Lieutenant-General Grant, City Point : The President feels solicitous about the disposition of Thomas, to lay in fortifications for an indefinite period \"until Wilson gets equipments.\" This looks like the McClellan and Rosecrans strategy of do nothing, and let the enemy raid the country. The President writes you to consider the matter. EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War."], [265, "251 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. City Point, Va., December 2, 1864\u201411 a. m. Major-General Geo. H. Thomas, Nashville : If Hood is permitted to remain quietly about Nashville, we will lose all the roads back to Chattanooga, and possibly have to abandon the line of the Tennessee river. Should he attack you, it is all well, but if he does not, you should attack him before he fortifies. Arm and put in the trenches your quartermaster's employes, citizens, etc. (Signed,) TJ. S. GRANT, Lieutenant- General. City Point, Va., December 2, 1864\u20141.30 p. m. Major-General Geo. H. Thomas, Nashville: With your citizen employes armed, you can move out of Nashville with all your army, and force the enemy to retire or fight upon ground of your own choosing. After the repulse of Hood at Franklin, it looks to me that instead of falling back to Nashville, we should have taken the offensive against the enemy, but at this distance may err as to the method of deal ing with the enemy. You will suffer incalculable injury upon your rail roads, if Hood is not speedily disposed of. Put forth, therefore, every pos sible exertion to attain this end. Should you get him to retreating, give him no peace. (Signed,) U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General. Headquarters Department of the Cumberland, Nashville, Tenn., December 2, 1864 \u2014 10 p. m. General U. S. Grant, City Point, Va. : Your two telegrams of 11 a. m. and 1.30 p. M. to-day are received. At the time Hood was whipped at Franklin, 1 had at this place but about five thousand (5,000) men of General Smith's command, which, added to the force under General Schofield, would not have given me more than twenty-five thousand (25,000) men. Besides, General Schofield felt con vinced that he could not hold the enemy at Franklin until the five thou sand could reach him. As General Wilson's cavalry force also numbered only about one-fourth that of Forrest, I thought it best to draw the troops back to Nashville, and await the arrival of the remainder of General Smith's force, and also a force of about five thousand (5,000) commanded by General Steedman, which I had ordered up from Chattanooga. The division of General Smith arrived yesterday morning, and General Steed man's troops arrived last night. I now have infantry enough to assume the offensive, if I had more cavalry ; and will take the field anyhow as soon as the remainder of General McCook's division of cavalry reaches here, which I hope it will in two or three days. We can neither get reinforcements nor equipments at this great dis tance from the North very easily, and it must be remembered that my command was made up of the two weakest corps of General Sherman's"], [266, "252 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. army, and all the dismounted cavalry except one brigade ; and the task of reorganizing and equipping has met with many delays, which have en abled Hood to take advantage of my crippled condition. I earnestly hope, however, in a few more days, I shall be able to give him a fight. (Signed,) GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. City Point, Va., December 5, 1864\u20146.30 p. m. Major-General Geo. H. Thomas, Nashville, Tenn. : Is there not danger of Forrest's moving down the Tennessee river where he can cross it? It seems to me, while you should be getting up your cavalry as rapidly as possible to look after Forrest, Hood should be attacked where he is. Time strengthens him, in all probability, as much as it does you. (Signed,) U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant- General. Nashville, December 6, 1864. Lieutenant-General U. S. Grant, City Point : Your telegram of 6.30 p. m., December 5th, is just received. As soon as I get up a respectable force of cavalry I will march against Hood. General Wilson has parties out now pressing horses, and I hope to have some six or eight thousand cavalry mounted in three days from this time. General Wilson has just left me, having received instructions to hurry the cavalry to remount as rapidly as possible. I do not think it prudent to attack Hood with less than six thousand (6,000) cavalry to cover my flanks, because he has under Forrest at least twelve thousand (12,000). I have no doubt Forrest will attempt to cross the river, but I am in hopes the gunboats will be able to prevent him. The enemy has made no new developments to-day. Breckinridge is reported at Lebanon with six thousand (6,000) men, but I can not believe it possible. (Signed,) GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. City Point, Va., December 6, 1864 \u2014 4 p. M. Major-General Geo. H. Thomas, Nashville: Attack Hood at once, and wait no longer for a remount for your cav alry. There is great danger in delay, resulting in a campaign back to the Ohio. (Signed,) TJ. S. GRANT, Lieutenant- General. Nashville, December 6, 1864 \u2014 9 p. m. Lieutenant-General U. S. Grant, City Point : Your dispatch of 4 p. m. this day received. I will make the necessary disposition and attack Hood at once, agreeably to your orders, though I"], [267, "253 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. believe it will be hazardous with the small force of cavalry now at my service. (Signed,) GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. War Department, Washington, December 7, 1864 \u2014 10.20 a. m. Lieutenant-General Grant : You remember that when Steele was relieved by Canby he was ordered to Cairo, to report to this department. What shall be done with him ? The order superseding Rosecrans by Dodge has been issued. Thomas seems unwilling to attack because it is hazardous, as if all war was any but hazardous. If he waits for Wilson to get ready, Gabriel will be blow ing his last horn. EDWIN M. STANTON. City Point, Va., December 8, 1864. Major-General Halleck, Washington : Please direct General Dodge to send all the troops he can spare to Gen eral Thomas. With such an order, he can be relied on to send all that can properly go. They had probably better be sent to Louisville, for I fear either Hood or Breckinridge will go to the Ohio river. I will submit whether it is not advisable to call on Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, for 60,000 men for thirty days. If Thomas has not struck yet, he ought to be ordered to hand over his command to Schofield. There is no better man to repel an attack than Thomas, but I fear he is too cautious to take the initiative. U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General. War Department, Washington, D, C, December 8, 1864. Lieutenant-General Grant, City Point: If you wish General Thomas relieved, give the order. No one here will, I think, interfere. The responsibility, however, will be yours, as no one here, so far as I am informed, wishes General Thomas removed. H. W. HALLECK, Major- General, Chief of Staff. Nashville, Tenn., December 7, 1864 \u2014 9 p. m. Major-General H. W. Halleck, Washington, D. C. : The enemy has not increased his force on our front. Have sent gun boats up the river above Carthage. One returned to-day, and reported no signs of the enemy on the river bank from forty miles above Carthage to this place. Captain Fitch, U.

Major-General Geo. H. Thomas, Nashville : Your dispatch of yesterday received. It looks to me evidently the enemy are trying to cross the Cumberland, and are scattered. Why not attack at once ? By all means avoid the contingency of a foot-race to see which, you or Hood, can beat to the Ohio. If you think necessary, call on the governors of states to send a force into Louisville to meet the enemy if he should cross the river. You clearly never should cross, ex cept in rear of the enemy. Now is one of the fairest opportunities ever presented of destroying one of the three armies of the enemy. If de stroyed, he can never replace it. Use the means at your command, and you can do this and cause a rejoicing from one end of the land to the other. (Signed,) TJ. S. GRANT, Lieutenant- General.

I feel conscious that I have done everything in my power to prepare, and that the troops could not have been gotten ready before this.

Grant, City Point : Your dispatch of 8.30 p. m. of the 8th is just received. I have nearly completed my preparations to attack the enemy to-morrow morning, but a terrible storm of freezing rain has come on to-day, which will make it impossible for our men to fight to any advantage. I am therefore com pelled to wait for the storm to break, and make the attack immediately after. Admiral Lee is patrolling the river above and below the city, and I believe will be able to prevent the enemy from crossing. There is no doubt but Hood's forces are considerably scattered along the river, with the view of attempting a crossing, but it has been impossible for me to organize and equip the troops for an attack at an earlier time. Major- General Halleck informs me that you are very much dissatisfied with my delay in attacking. I can only say I have done all in my power to pre pare, and if you should deem it necessary to relieve me, I shall submit without a murmur. (Signed,) GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V.

He did say he thought he should be able to attack on the 7th, but he did not do so, nor has he given a reason for not doing it. I am very unwilling to do injustice to an officer who has done so much good service as General Thomas has, however, and will therefore suspend the order relieving him until it is seen whether he will do anything. U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant- General. City Point, Va., December 9, 1864\u20147.30 p. m. Major-General Thomas, Nashville : Your dispatch of 1 p. m. to-day is received. I have as much confidence in your conducting the battle rightly as I have in any other officer, but it has seemed to me you have been slow, and I have had no explanation of affairs to convince me otherwise. Receiving your dispatch to Major- General Hallack of 2 p. m. before I did the first to me, I telegraphed to"], [271, "257 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. suspend the order relieving you, until we should hear further.

City Point, Va., December 11, 1864 \u2014 4 p. m. Major-General Geo. H. Thomas, Nashville : If you delay attacking longer, the mortifying spectacle will be wit nessed of a rebel army moving for the Ohio, and you will be forced to act, accepting such weather as you find. Let there be no further delay. Hood can not stand even a drawn battle so far from his supplies of ord nance stores. If he retreats and you follow, he must lose his material and most of his army. I am in hopes of receiving a dispatch from you to-day announcing that you have moved. Delay no longer for weather or reinforcements. U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General. Nashville, Tenn., December 11, 1864 \u2014 10.30 p. m. Lieutenant-General U. S. Grant, City Point, Va. : Your dispatch of 4 p. m. this day is just received. I will obey the order as promptly as possible, however much I may regret it, as the attack will have to be made under every disadvantage. The whole country is cov ered with a perfect sheet of ice and sleet, and it is with difficulty the troops are able to move about on level ground. It was my intention to attack Hood as soon as the ice melted, and would have done so yesterday had it not been for the storm. (Signed,) GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. Nashville, Tenn., December 12, 1864\u201410.30 p. m. Major-General Halleck, Washington, D. C. : I have the troops ready to make the attack on the enemy as soon as the sleet which now covers the ground has melted sufficiently to enable the men to march. As the whole country is now covered with a sheet of ice so hard and slippery, it is utterly impossible for troops to ascend the slopes, or even move over level ground in anything like order. It has taken the entire day to place my cavalry in position, and it has only been finally effected with imminent risk, and many serious accidents, re sulting from the numbers of horses falling with their riders on the road. Under these circumstances, I believe that an attack at this time would only result in a useless sacrifice of life. (Signed,) GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V.

(Signed,) T. S. BOWERS, Assistant Adjutant-General. Major-General Geo. H. Thomas, Nashville: It has been seriously apprehended that while Hood, with a part of his forces, held you in check near Nashville, he would have time to co-operate against other important points, left only partially protected. Hence, Lieutenant-General Grant was anxious that you should attack the rebel forces in your front, and expresses great dissatisfaction that his order had not been carried out. Moreover, so long as Hood occupies a threatening position in Tennessee, General Canby is obliged to keep large forces on the Mississippi river to protect its navigation, and to hold Memphis, Vicksburg, etc., although General Grant had directed a part of these forces to co-operate with Sherman.

C. : This army thanks you for your approbation of its conduct yesterday, and to assure you that it is not misplaced, I have the honor to report that the enemy has been pressed at all points to-day on his line of retreat through the Brentwood hills, and Brigadier-General Hatch, of Wilson's corps of cavalry, on the right, turned the enemy's left and captured a large number of prisoners; number not yet reported. Major-General Schofield's troops, next on the left of cavalry, carried several heights, captured many prisoners and six pieces of artillery. Brevet Major-General Smith, next on the left Major-General Schofield, carried the salient point of the enemy's line, with McMillen's brigade of McArthur's division, capturing sixteen pieces of artillery, two brigadier-generals, and about two thousand prisoners. Brigadier-General Garrard's division of Smith's command, next on the left of McArthur's division, carried the enemy's intrenchments, capturing all the artillery and troops on the line. Brig adier-General Wood's corps, on the Franklin pike, took up the assault, carried the enemy's intrenchments in his front, captured eight (8) pieces, something over six hundred prisoners, and drove the enemy within one mile of the Brentwood Pass. Major-General Steedman, commanding de tachments of the Military Division of the Mississippi, most nobly sup ported General Wood's left, and bore a most honorable part in the operations of the day. I have ordered the pursuit to be continued in the morning at daylight, although the troops are very much fatigued. The greatest enthusiasm prevails. I must not forget to report the opera tions of Brigadier-General Johnson, in successfully driving the enemy, with co-operation of the gunboats, under Lieutenant-Commander Fitch, from their established batteries on the Cumberland river below the city of Nashville, and the of services of Brigadier-General Croxton's brigade, in covering and relieving our right and rear in the operations pf yesterday and to-day. Although I have no report of the number of prisoners cap tured by Johnson's and Croxton's commands, I know they have made a large number. I am glad to be able to state that the number of prisoners captured yesterday greatly exceeds the number reported by me last evening. The roads, fields, and intrenchments are strewn with the en emy's abandoned small arms, abandoned in their retreat. In conclusion, I am happy to state that all this has been effected with but a very small loss to us. Our loss does not probably exceed three thousand, very few killed. GEO. H.

Sherman has fully established his base on Ossabaw Sound, with Savannah fully invested. I hope to be able to fire a salute to-morrow in honor of the fall of Savannah. In all your opera tions, we hear nothing of Forrest. Great precaution should be taken to prevent him crossing the Cumberland or Tennessee rivers below Eastport. After Hood is driven as far as possible to follow him, you want to re occupy Decatur and all other abandoned points. U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General. Washington, December 21, 1864 \u2014 12 m. Major-General Geo. H. Thomas : Permit me, general, to urge the vast importance of a hot pursuit of Hood's army. Every possible sacrifice should be made, and your men for a few days will submit to any hardships and privations to accomplish the great result. If you can capture or destroy Hood's army, General Sherman can entirely crush out the rebel military force in all the South ern States. He begins a new campaign about the first of January, which will have the most important results if Hood's army can now be used up. A most vigorous pursuit on your part is therefore of vital impor tance to General Sherman's plans. No sacrifice must be spared to obtain so important a result. (Signed,) H. W. HALLECK, Major-General and Chief of Staff. In the Field, December 21, 1864. Major-General Halleck, Washington, D. C. Your dispatch of 12 m. this day is received. General Hood's army is being pursued as rapidly and as vigorously as it is possible for one army to pursue another. We can not control the elements, and you must re member that, to resist Hood's advance into Tennessee, I had to reorganize and almost thoroughly equip the force now under my command. I fought the battles of the 15th and 16th insts. with the troops but partially equip ped, and notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather and the partial equipment, have been enabled to drive the enemy beyond Duck river, crossing two streams with my troops, and driving the enemy from posi tion to position, without the aid of pontoons, and with but little transpor tation to bring up supplies of provisions and ammunition. I am doing all in my power to crush Hood's army, and, if it be possible, will destroy it. But pursuing an enemy through an exhausted country, over mud roads completely sogged with heavy rains, is no child's play, and can not be accomplished as quickly as thought of. I hope, in urging me to push the enemy, the department remembers that General Sherman took with him the complete organization of the Military Division of the Mississippi,"], [276, "262 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. well equipped in every respect, as regards ammunition, supplies, and transportation, leaving me only two corps, partially stripped of their transportation, to accommodate the force taken with him, to oppose the advance into Tennessee of that army which had resisted the advance of the army of the Military Division of the Mississippi on Atlanta, from the commencement of the campaign till its close, and which is now in addi tion aided by Forrest's cavalry. Although my progress may appear slow, I feel assured that Hood's army can be driven from Tennessee, and event ually driven to the wall by the force under my command. But too much must not be expected of troops which have to be reorganized, especially when they have the task of destroying a force, in a winter's campaign, which was able to make an obstinate resistance to twice its numbers in spring and summer. In conclusion, I can safely state that the army is willing to submit to any sacrifice to oust Hood's army, or to strike any other blow which may contribute to the destruction of the rebellion. (Signed,) GEO. H. THOMAS, Major- General. City Point, December 22, 1864. Major-General Geo. H. Thomas : You have the congratulations of the public for the energy with which you are pushing Hood. I hope you will succeed in reaching his pontoon bridge at Tuscumbia before he gets there. Should you do so, it looks to me that Hood is cut off. If you succeed in destroying Hood's army, there will be but one army left to the so-called Confederacy capable of doing us harm. I will take care of that, and try to draw the sting from it, so that in the spring we shall have easy sailing. You have now a big oppor tunity, which I know you are availing yourself of. Let us push and do all we can before the enemy can derive benefit either from the raising of negro troops on the plantations, or white troops now in the field. (Signed,) U. S.

The railroad bridges between Spring Hill and this place, five in number, have been destroyed, but the con struction corps is hard at work, and I am in hopes will have the road re paired up to Columbia in the course of four or five days. The railroad between Chattanooga and Murfreesboro is in running order, and I am assured that the road between Nashville and Murfreesboro will be re paired in a few days. General McCook has routed and scattered the rebel General Lyon, who succeded in crossing the Cumberland river, and with General Long, will soon join General Wilson, thus increasing my cavalry force sufficiently to enable me to completely destroy Forrest, if I can overtake him, which I shall make every exertion to do.

Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, Savannah, Ga., December 23, 1864. Dear General : \u2014 Major Dixon arrived last night, bringing your letter of the 10th December, for which I am very much obliged, as it gives me a clear and distinct view of the situation of affairs at Nashville up to that date. I have also from the War Department a copy of General Thomas' dispatch, giving an account of the attack on Hood on the 15th, which was successful, but not complete. I await further accounts with anxiety, as Thomas' complete success is necessar}^ to initiate my plans for this cam paign, and I have no doubt that my calculation, that Thomas had in hand (including A. J. Smith's troops) a force large enough to whip Hood in fair fight, was correct. I approved of Thomas' allowing Hood to come north far enough to enable him to concentrate his own men, though I would have preferred that Hood should have been checked about Colum bia. Still, if Thomas followed up his success of the 15th, and gave Hood a good whaling, and is at this moment following him closely, the whole campaign in my division will be even more perfect than the Atlanta cam paign, for at this end of the line I have realized all I had reason to hope for, except in the release of our prisoners, which was simply an impos sibility. December 24. \u2014 I have' just received a letter from General Grant, giving a detail of General Thomas' operations up to the 18th, and I am gratified beyond measure at the result. Show this letter to General Thomas, and tell him to consider it ad dressed to him, as I have not time to write more now. I want General Thomas to follow Hood to and beyond the Tennessee, and not hesitate to go on as far as Columbus, Mississippi, or Selma, Alabama, as I know that he will have no trouble whatever in subsisting his army anywhere below Sand Mountain, and along the Black Warrior. In the poorest part of Georgia, I found no trouble in subsisting my army and animals, some of my corps not issuing but one (1) day's bread from Atlanta to Sa vannah. Keep me fully advised by telegraph, via New York, of the situation of affairs in Tennessee. I will be here probably ten (10) days longer, and in communication for a longer time. I am, very truly yours, W. T. SHERMAN, Major- General. General J. D. Webster, Nashville, Tenn. Headquarters Department of the Cumberland, Pulaski, Tenn., December 28, 1864. Major-General Steedman, Decatur, Ala. : Your dispatch of the 27th received. I am very much gratified with your operations against Decatur. The roads from here to Florence are in an almost impassable condition, and the country is so completely devas-"], [279, "265 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. tated that we scarcely get any supplies ; but the enemy has been as vig orously pursued as circumstances will admit. It is reported that Hood crossed at Lamb's ferry and Bainbridge, with what force he could get off. He is represented as being in a most deplorable condition. I shall try to intercept him at Iuka, if he retreats that way, and I want you to push a strong reconnoissance toward Lamb's ferry, to see if he has retreated by way of Courtland and Moulton. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding. [GENERAL ORDERS, NO. 169.] Pulaski, December 29, 1864. Soldiers : \u2014 The major-general commanding announces to you that the rear-guard of the flying and dispirited enemy was driven across the Ten nessee river, on the night of the 27th instant. The impassable state of the roads, and consequent impossibility to supply the army, compels a closing of the campaign for the present. Although short, it has been brilliant in its achievements, and unsur- passed in its results by any other of this war, and is one of which all who participated therein may be justly proud. That veteran army which, though driven from position to position, opposed a stubborn resistance to much superior numbers during the whole of the Atlanta campaign, taking advantage of the absence of the largest portion of the army which had been opposed to it in Georgia, invaded Tennessee, buoyant with hope, expect- ing Nashville, Murfreesboro, and the whole of Tennessee and Kentucky to fall into its power, an easy prey, and scarcely fixing a limit to its con- quests. After having received, at Franklin, the most terrible check that army has received during this war, and later, at Murfreesboro, in its at- tempt to capture that place, it was finally attacked at Nashville, and, although your forces were inferior to it in numbers, was hurled back from the coveted prize, on which it had been permitted to look from a distance, and finally sent flying, dismayed and disordered, whence it came, impelled by the instinct of self-preservation, and thinking only of how it could relieve itself for short intervals from your persistent and harassing pur- suit, by burning the bridges over the swollen streams, as it passed them, until, finally, it had placed the broad waters of the Tennessee river be tween you and its shattered, diminished, and discomfited columns, leav- ing its artillery and battle-flags in your victorious hands \u2014 lasting trophies of your noble daring, and lasting monuments of the enemy's disgrace and defeat. You have diminished the forces of the rebel army since it crossed the Tennessee river to invade the state, at the least estimate, fifteen thousand men, among whom were killed, wounded, and captured eighteen general officers. Your captures from the enemy, as far as reported, amount to sixty-eight pieces of artillery, ten thousand prisoners, as many stand of small arms \u2014"], [280, "266 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. several thousand of which have been gathered in, and the remainder strew the route of the enemy's retreat \u2014 and between thirty and forty flags, besides compelling him to destroy much ammunition and abandon many wagons; and, unless he is mad, he must forever abandon all hope of bringing Tennessee again within the lines of the accursed rebellion. A short time will now be given you to prepare to continue the work so nobly begun. By command of Major-General Thomas. W. D. WHIPPLE, Assistant Adjutant-General. EXTRACTS FROM GENERAL GEO. H. THOMAS' REPORT. On the morning of the 15th of December, the weather being favorable, the army was formed, and ready at an early hour to carry out the plan of battle promulgated in the special field orders of the 14th. The forma tion of troops was partially concealed from the enemy by the broken nature of the ground, as also by a fog, which lifted toward noon. Finding General Smith had not taken as much distance to the right as 1 expected he would have done, I directed General Schofield to move his command (the Twenty-Third Corps) from position in reserve, to which it had been assigned, over to the right of General Smith, enabling the cav alry thereby to operate more freely to the enemy's rear. This was rap idly accomplished by General Schofield, and his troops participated, in the closing operations of the day. * * * * * * * *-* Our line at nightfall was readjusted, running parallel to and east of the Hillsboro pike \u2014 Schofield's command on the right, Smith's in the center, and Wood's on the left, with cavalry on the right of Schofield, Steedman holding the position he had gained early in the morning. The total result of the day's operations was the capture of sixteen pieces of artillery and twelve hundred prisoners, besides several hundred stands of small arms, and about forty (40) wagons. The enemy had been forced back at all points with heavy loss. Our casualties were unusually light. The beha vior of the troops was unsurpassed for steadiness and alacrity in every movement, and the original plan of battle, with but few alterations, strictly adhered to. The whole command bivouacked in line of battle during the night, on the ground occupied at dark, while preparations were made to renew the battle at an early hour on the morrow. Immediately following the effort of the Fourth Corps, Generals Smith's and Schofield's commands moved against the enemy's works in their re spective fronts, carrying all before them, irreparably breaking his lines in a dozen places, and capturing all his artillery and thousands of prisoners \u2014 among the latter, four (4) general officers. Our loss was remarkably small, scarcely mentionable. All of the enemy that did escape were pur-"], [281, "BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. 267 sued over the tops of Brentwood and Harpeth hills. General Wilson's cavalry, dismounted, attacked the enemy simultaneously with Schofield and Smith, striking him in reverse, and gaining firm possession of Granny White pike, cut off his retreat by that route. Wood's and Steed man's troops hearing the shouts of victory coming from the right, rushed impetuously forward, renewing the assault on Overton's hill, and although meeting a very heavy fire, the onset was irresistible, artillery and many prisoners falling into our hands. The enemy, hopelessly broken, fled in confusion through Brentwood Pass, the Fourth Corps in close pursuit, which was continued for several miles, when darkness closed the scene, and the troops rested from their labors. During the two days' operations there were 4,462 prisoners captured, including 287 officers of all grades from that of major-general, fifty-three pieces of artillery, and thousands of small arms. The enemy abandoned on the field all of his dead and wounded. EXTRACT FROM GENERAL SCHOFIELD'S REPORT. On the night of the 15th I waited upon the major-general commanding, at his headquarters, and received his orders for the pursuit of the enemy on the following day. Our operations during the 15th had swung the right and center forward, so that the general direction of the line was nearly perpendicular to that before the attack, only the right was in con tact with the enemy, and was therefore much exposed. Apprehensive that the enemy, instead of retreating during the night, would mass and attack our right in the morning, I requested that a division of infantry be sent to reinforce the right, which was ordered accordingly from Major- General Smith's command. In response to this order, General Smith sent five regiments and a battery (about 1,600 men), which were put in reserve near the right. In the morning it was found that the enemy still held his position in our front, of which the hill in front of General Couch was the key, and had thrown up considerable breastworks during the night. He had also increased the force on his left during the night, and continued to mass troops during the early part of the day. During the morning, therefore, our operations were limited' to preparations for' de fense and co-operation with cavalry, which was operating to strike the Granny White pike, in rear of the enemy. About noon, the troops on my left (Generals Smith and Wood) having advanced and come in contact with the enemy in his new position, the enemy again withdrew from his left a considerable force to strengthen his right and center, when I ordered General Cox to advance, in conjunc tion with cavalry, and endeavor to carry a high wooded hill beyond the flank of the enemy's intrenched line and overlooking the Granny White pike. The hill was occupied by the enemy in considerable force, but was not intrenched. My order was not executed with the promptness or en-"], [282, "268 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. ergy which I had expected, yet probably with as much as I had reason to expect, considering the attenuated character of General Cox's line and the great distance and rough ground over which the attacking force had to move. The hill was, however, carried by General Wilson's cavalry (dismounted), whose gallantry and energy on that and other occasions, which came under my observations, can not be too greatly praised. Almost simultaneously with this attack on the extreme right, the salient hill, in front of General Couch, was attacked and carried by General Smith's troops, supported by a brigade of General Couch's division, and the fortified hill in front of General Cox, which constituted the extreme flank of the enemy's intrenched line, was attacked and carried by Colonel Doolittle's brigade of General Cox's division, the latter capturing eight pieces of artillery and two to three hundred prisoners. EXTRACT FROM GENERAL SMITH'S REPORT. During the night a request coming from General Schoefield, command ing Twenty-third Corps, for reinforcements, I sent him the Third division, Colonel J. B. Moore commanding, just before daylight. On the morning of the 16th, advancing my line in the same order as on the previous day, the First on the right and the Second divison on the left, it was discovered that the enemy had taken position at the base of a chain of hills, called the Brentwood hills, with a front nearly perpendicular to our lines, and had strongly intrenched themselves b}T throwing up breastworks and massing artillery in every available position. Changing my front by a half-wheel, by brigades the command moved slowly in echelon from the right, so as not to break connections with the Fourth Corps, and took a position directly in front of the enemy, at a distance of about six hun dred yards, my right resting at the base of a hill, on the top of which was the enemy's left, and my line being the whole front of the two divisions, extending about one mile. The enemy opening a heavy artillery fire upon my brigades, as they went into position, all the batteries of the First and Second divisions, six in number, were brought into action at a dis tance of about eight hundred yards, and after a fierce cannonading of about two hours, succeeded in quieting the enemy's guns in our front. The Twenty-third Corps was on my right in the intrenchments, thrown up by them the night before, and nearly at right angles with my present line. Expecting that corps to take the initiative, as they were on the flank of the enemy, I held the command in its present position, keeping up a slow artillery fire at their line without eliciting any reply. About 1 o'clock I received a request from General Schofield, and a few min utes later an order from you, to send another division to his assistance, he having retained the one sent at daylight that morning, not having any reserve, and my whole line being in front of the enemy, and liable to be attacked and broken at any point wherever a brigade should be with drawn, I therefore sent a staff officer to him to state the condition of"], [283, "269 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE, ETC. my command, and ascertain if he could not get along without my divis ion. The officer reported to me that General Schofield's line was not en gaged, and upon my condition being reported to him, he said he did not need the additional force, consequently it was not sent. About 3 o'clock p. m. General McArthur sent word that he could carry the hill on his left by assault. Major-General Thomas being present, the matter was referred to him, and I was requested to delay the movement until he could hear from General Schofield, to whom he had sent. General Mc- Arthur not receiving any reply, and fearing if the attack should be longer delayed the enemy would use the right to strengthen his works, directed the First brigade, Colonel N. L. McMillen, Ninty-fifth Ohio Infantry, to storm the hill on which was the left of the enemy's line, and the Second and Third brigades of the division to attack in front, when the first should be half-way up the hill."], [284, "270 CHAPTER XXXVI. MINOR OPERATIONS HAVING RELATIONS MORE OR LESS INTIMATE WITH THOSE OF THE MAIN ARMY DURING NOVEMBER AND DE- CEMBER. General Steedman knew, upon reaching Decatur, that it was too late to embarrass the enemy in crossing the Tennessee river, but he determined to move toward his line of retreat south of the river. He had been joined at Stevenson by Colonel ~W. J. Palmer, of the Fifteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, with a force composed of his own regiment and detachments from the Sec ond Tennessee, and the Tenth, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Indiana Cavalry, in all about six hundred and fifty men. At 8 p. M. on the 28th, Colonel Palmer moved from Decatur toward Court land. He encountered the enemy at a point two miles distant, a,nd attacking with his advance of thirty men pressed him back. The force was Colonel \"Wines' regiment of Poddy's command, and this commander was resisting to cover his artillery, but against thirty men, yielded his position and two pieces of artil lery. Colonel Palmer the next day divided his force, sending Colonel Prosser with the detachments on the main road, and moving with his own regiment on the Brown's Perry road. Colonel Prosser soon met Eoddy's whole force drawn up in two lines, and without hesitation charged, broke his lines, captured forty -five men, and drove the enemy through Courtland. At Leighton, on the 30th, Colonel Palmer learned that Gen eral Hood's pontoon train of two hundred wagons had passed through the day before en route for Columbus, Mississippi. General Roddy was in the rear to protect this train, and al though Colonel Palmer felt safe in disregarding him in making an effort to capture it, it was necessary that he should shun"], [285, "NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER, 1864. 271 another cavalry force under General Armstrong, which was also near. Making the venture, he moved to the rear of a por tion of Poddy's command, and captured Colonel Warren and other prisoners. At Russellville, another portion was met and routed, and Palmer then pressed on after the train and soon captured it, consisting of two hundred wagons and seventy eight boats with appointments complete. Such was the con dition of the roads and the teams that it was not considered safe to attempt its removal from the presence of the enemy, and hence it was destroyed. Then having heard that a supply train was moving from Barton Station to Tuscumbia, Colonel Palmer moved to capture it. On the 1st of January, this train, consisting of one hundred and ten wagons and five hundred mules, was also taken in Itawamba county, Mississippi, and mules enough saved to mount one hundred and fifty prisoners. Losing one man killed and two wounded, Colonel Palmer re turned to Decatur. In the meantime, General Steedman had been ordered to Chattanooga. He put his sick men and his artillery on trans ports, and started his infantry by rail, under General Crust. Wlren the force reached Huntsville, Colonel Mitchell's brigade was hurried forward to Larkinsville, to intercept, if possible, General Lyon, who, with a portion of his command, was in re treat from Kentucky. His expedition had proved disastrous in the extreme in its general issue. He captured Hopkinsville, but was met near Greenbury by General McCook, who had been detached from the main army to protect the Louisville and Nashville railroad, and to pursue this raiding force. Col onel La Grange first met Lyon with his brigade. Engaging him with spirit, after a short conflict he threw his troops into confusion and rout, capturing one gun and some prisoners. General Lyon then made a detour through Elizabethtown and Glasgow, and crossed the Cumberland river at Burksville, and thence proceeded through McMinnville and Winchester to the Memphis and Charleston railroad. On the 7th of January, Gen eral Crust's command was disposed to capture him or drive him across the Tennessee river at the approaches to Bellefont, Lar kinsville, and Scottsboro ; but he succeeded in eluding all the detachments on the watch, and crossed the Tennessee river."], [286, "NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER, 1864. 272 He was finally intercepted and captured, with one hundred of his men and his remaining gun, at Ped Hill. He, however, es caped, having shot the soldier in charge of him. As General Thomas was in command of all the troops within the limits of the Military Division of the Mississippi, the oper ations in East Tennessee were subject to his direction. There had been complications there during the summer and early autumn, and General Schofield had left his corps at Atlanta, to give attention to affairs in that region. General J. H. Mor gan had been killed by General Gillem's troops, but infantry had been subsequently sent there, and when General Hood was menacing Tennessee from Florence, General Breckinridge, sup ported by Duke and Vaughn, appeared before General Gillem at Bull's Gap. At this period, General Gillem, commanding three regiments of Tennessee cavalry and a battery, was acting under the immediate instructions of Governor Johnson, having been detached for this duty. On the 13th of November, Gen eral Breckinridge, with a force estimated at three thousand men, attacked and routed the fifteen hundred under General Gillem, capturing about one third, including his battery. Gen eral Gillem had repulsed two attacks of the enemy, but rein forcements having come, he concluded to withdraw, and while retreating was attacked in rear. There was a lack of co-oper ation between General Gillem and General Ammen, which Geueral Thomas considered the cause of the disaster. General Gillem fell back upon Knoxville with the remainder of his force, followed closely by General Breckinridge. In the emergency, General Thomas directed General Steed man to hold troops in readiness to support General Ammen, at Knoxville ; and General Stoneman, in command of the De partment of the Ohio, in the absence of General Schofield, ordered a concentration of forces in Kentucky, to advance from Lexington to Cumberland Gap, either to repel the en emy, should he advance into Kentucky, or to advance into East Tennessee, should he continue to operate there. On the 18th, General Breckinridge withdrew from the vicin ity of Knoxville, and General Ammen, reinforced by fifteen hundred men from Chattanooga, reoccupied Strawberry Plains the same day. About the same time, Geueral Stoneman left"], [287, "NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER, 1864. 273 Louisville to take the direction of affairs in East Tennessee, and on his way received his instructions from General Thomas, at Nashville. He was directed \" to concentrate the larsrest force possible against Breckinridge, and either destroy his force or drive it into Virginia, and, if possible, destroy the salt-works at Saltville, and the railroad from the Tennessee line as far into Virginia as he could go without endangering his command.\" On the 6th of December, General Thomas repeated his instructions upon the receipt of information that General Breckinridge was retreating. General Stoneman had been delayed in consequence of the deficiency of his command in the essential appointments for the service proposed. On the 9th, he was ready for active operations. His command comprised the infantry and dis mounted cavalry under General Ammen, General Gillem's force, and the mounted troops under General Burbridge, forty two hundred men. He first sent the Fourth Tennessee and Third North Carolina regiments to Paint Rock, to hold the pass over the mountains into North Carolina. December 9th, he moved two regiments of Ohio artillery from Strawberry Plains to Blair's Cross-roads, and with General Gillem pro ceeded to that point the next day. At Bean's Station these forces were joined on the 11th by General Burbridge's com mand. Hitherto the commander alone knew the service and destination of the troops, but here the men were supplied with all the ammunition and rations that they could carry on themselves and horses. On the 13th, at daylight, General Gillem reached the north fork of the Holston river, opposite Kingston. Here was General John Morgan's command, un der his brother, in the temporary absence of General Duke. After a sharp conflict, General Gillem crossed the river and totally defeated the enemy, capturing Morgan and a portion of his command, and killing or dispersing the remainder. During the afternoon, Burbridge was pushed on to Bristol, in the endeavor to intercept Vaughn, who had held Greenville for some time with a force estimated at twelve hundred men. At night, Generals Stoneman and Gillem followed, arriving at Bristol early on the 14th. Fearing that Vaughn would pass in the night and join"], [288, "NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER, 1864. 274 Breckinridge, Burbridge was sent to Abingdon with instruc tions to send a regiment forward to strike the railroad at some point between Saltville and Wytheville. When General Gillem had completed the destruction of Bristol, which Gen eral Burbridge had commenced, he moved to Glade Springs, followed by Burbridge. At 2 a. m. on the 16th, General Stoneman learned that the Twelfth Kentucky Cavalry, sent forward from Abingdon, after threatening the salt-works, had destroyed two trains which had brought Breckinridge from \"Wytheville with reinforcements, and decided to press on to Wytheville, destroy it and the salt-works on New river, and give attention to the destruction of Saltville on his return. He therefore put his forces in motion eastward, and soon Gen eral Gillem overtook Vaughn at Marion, and attacking, routed him, pursuing rapidly to Wytheville, capturing his trains, ar tillery, and one hundred and ninety-eight men, and destroying the town. General Burbridge reached Mount Airy the next day, where Buckley's brigade was dispatched by order of Gen eral Stoneman to destroy the lead mines twenty -five or thirty miles beyond. Nothing now remained but the destruction of Saltville, and General Stoneman, by a quick return, interposed his command so that General Breckinridge was cut off and forced to retreat into North Carolina. The two main columns were then ordered to converge upon Saltville. When they were near, and General Stoneman was waiting for General Burbridge, he sent Colonel Stacy with his regiment, the Thirteenth Tennessee, to dash into the town and commence the work of destruction with all possible noise. The brilliant dash of Stacy put the enemy into retreat, and then the cele brated salt-works with all their machinery and supplies were destroyed. This expedition brought defeat to the enemy at every step, and destruction to important manufactories of the material of war, to vast quantities of material of every kind, and to rail roads and rolling-stock. General Burbridge destroyed five trains filled with supplies, a thousand stand of arms, a vast amount of fixed ammunition, and a large number of wagons and ambulances, and captured seventeen officers and two hun dred and sixty privates ; Buckley ruined the lead-works in"], [289, "NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER, 1864. 275 Wythe county ; Major Harrison, of the Twelfth Kentucky Cavalry, captured two railroad trains, destroyed all the railroad bridges from Glade Springs to Marion, and the large iron works at the latter place, and captured several hundred fine horses ; General Gillem's brigade, reinforced by the Eleventh Michigan and the Eleventh Kentucky Cavalry, drove Vaughn beyond Wytheville, destroyed that town, all the railroad bridges from Marion to Reedy creek, vast amounts of stores and supplies of all kinds, several hundred wagons and ambu lances, two locomotives and several cars, and captured ten pieces of field artillery, and over two hundred prisoners. This command made an average march of forty-two and a half miles per day, completing its work of destruction on the 22d of December.

THOMAS, Major-General U. S. V. Commanding."], [292, "CHAPTER XXXVII THE MARCH TO THE SEA, AND THE CAPTURE OP THE CITY OF SAVANNAH, GEORGIA. General Sherman's forces selected for his march to the sea coast comprised sixty thousand infantry and five thousand five hundred cavalry, and one piece of artillery for every thousand men. These troops had been so thoroughly sifted that they really represented a much larger army than this aggregate, with the usual percentage of ineffective men. They were or ganized into right and left wings ; the former embracing the Fifteenth and Seventeenth Corps, under the command of Major-General 0. 0. Howard, and the latter the Fourteenth and Twentieth Corps, under Major-General H. W. Slocum. The Fifteenth and Seventeenth Corps, from the Army of the Tennessee, were commanded respectively by Major-Generals P. T. Osterhaus and F. P. Blair, and the Fourteenth and Twen tieth, from the Army of the Cumberland, were commanded respectively by Brevet Major-General J. C. Davis and Brigadier- General A. S. Williams. The appointments were ample be yond precedent, as selection had been made from the material of the Military Division of the Mississippi ; in fact, each corps had complete army appointments, that each might have the independence of a separate army. The last ten days of October and the first days of No vember had been devoted to preparation. Supplies had been accumulated at Atlanta in such quantities that there were forty days' rations of beef, sugar, and coffee, twenty days' of bread, and a double allowance of salt for forty days. The amount of ammunition was ample for all possibilities. There was little forage, only for three days in grain ; but it was (278)"], [293, "279 THE MARCH TO THE SEA. known that the lines of march penetrated regions abounding in corn and fodder, and also in substantial supplies for men, and those delicacies in great abundance which do not often fall to soldiers. All the material at Atlanta not needed for the expedition was 6ent to the rear, or devoted to destruction with a large portion of the city. The garrisons north of Kingston moved to Chattanooga, and the rails were lifted from the railroad track from Resaca north ; but those between Resaca and the Etowah river were left in place in view of the probable occupancy of the country as far forward as the line of that river. November 11th, General Corse, in obedience to orders, de stroyed the bridges, foundries, mills, shops, machines, and all property useful in war, at Rome, Georgia. The next day, the telegraph wires extending northward from Kingston were cut, and the several corps moved rapidly toward Atlanta. On the 14th, the four corps and cavalry were grouped around that city, and on the 15th, the Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and Twen tieth Corps moved out upon their respective lines of march, and that night the conflagration of a large portion of At lanta gave emphatic announcement that the grand movement had begun. As the great objects of this expedition were an illustration of the weakness of the Confederacy behind its defensive and offensive lines, and the diminution of its remaining resources by the destruction of railroads and all property useful in war, the lines of march diverged widely. Besides, there was an other end to be secured by this broad divergent front in mov ing from Atlanta \u2014 the concealment of the ultimate objective, that the enemy might not know where to concentrate his forces. The right wing, with Kilpatrick's division of cavalry on its right flank, marched by Jonesboro and McDonough, under orders to make a strong feint upon Macon, and then turn eastward and rendezvous at Gordon on the 23d. The Twentieth Corps advanced by Decatur, Stone Mountain, So cial Circle, and Madison, to turn southward to Milledgeville, under instructions to tear up the railroad from Social Circle to Madison, and burn the railroad bridge over the Oconee in the same period. On the 16th, the Fourteenth Corps advanced"], [294, "280 THE MARCH TO THE SEA. upon Milledgeville, through Lithonia, Covington, and Shady Dale. On the 23d, the right wing and the cavalry reached Gordon and the left wing Milledgeville ; and this first stage of the cam paign was the realization of all anticipations. General Sher man had interposed his army between Macon and Augusta, and the enemy, in his doubt as to his destination and his utter inability to oppose him wherever he might go, was paralyzed completely. He had not, in the eight days, shown any great strength at any point, and it was evident that no strong force was opposing either of the two main columns. His cavalry, under General Wheele^ which had been dispatched as a corps of observation, had engaged General Kilpatrick several times, and General Cobb's militia and regular troops, from Macon and Savannah, had sallied from the former place to receive severe punishment from Walcntt's brigade ; and besides these feeble demonstrations there had been no opposition, and it was manifest that no serious resistance could be organized in Cen tral Georgia. The veteran troops were either with General Hood, in Tennessee, or in the large cities on the seaboard, and General Sherman's plans had been discerned too late for any troops in force to be directed to his front. When General Beauregard, who was at Corinth directing the great concen tration of forces which was to march in triumph to the Ohio river, learned that General Sherman with a large army was marching southward from Atlanta, he committed to General Hood the conduct of the Tennessee campaign, and hastened to Georgia to arouse the people, by frantic proclamations, to re sist this overwhelming invasion. His own second great plan of aggression from Corinth, Mississippi, was now, as far as he was personally concerned, as palpabale a failure as was his first, when he evacuated Corinth in May, 1862, with an army embracing all the available Confederate troops in the West. Appeals of similar fervor and futility were issued by the Con federate authorities at Richmond, including the President and Congress \u2014 at least by the congressional representatives from Georgia\u2014 and from the governor of the invaded state. While there was a veteran army between the homes of the people and the invader, there was some basis for appeal ; but now the"], [295, "THE MARCH TO THE SEA. 281 hopelessness of the situation was so apparent that the people were paralyzed with fear and despair, and noisy proclamations were as impotent as the cry of women and children. The orders for the second stage of the campaign sent the two wings on parallel lines toward Millin, and Kilpatrick to destroy the railroad between Milledgeville and Augusta, and then to hasten to Millin, to rescue the prisoners supposed to be there confined. On the 26th, the heads of columns of the left wing gained Sandersville, and then swept eastward toward the Georgia Central railroad, and the right wing moved from Gordon, on the line of the railroad. December 2d, the cen tral columns of the two corps were at Millin, and the extreme corps were abreast. Immense damage had been done to the railroads, mills, cotton-mills, and gins, and some fighting had occurred on the flanks, especially by the cavalry \u2014 Kilpatrick having had several brushes with Wheeler, but had been vic torious, whether in offense or defense. The heads of columns had also been slightly annoyed, but not to an extent to greatly embarrass their movements. The greatest obstacles on the way to Millin were the Ogeechee and Oconee rivers, and an army behind these streams might have been successful in re sistance, but the enemy's slender forces were easily dislodged, and the army passed over without delay. There had been no rescue of prisoners from the enemy, as all had been removed from Millin too soon. Instructions for the third and last stage required the con vergence of the wings upon Savannah \u2014 the left wing and the Seventeenth Corps moving on parallel roads, and the Fif teenth Corps deflecting to the right, on the right bank of the Ogeechee, to cross at Eden Station. General Wheeler followed the columns on the east bank, but their rear was protected by Kilpatrick's cavalry and Baird's division of the Fourteenth Corps. As the army approached Savannah, the country be came more marshy, and the roads more obstructed by fallen trees, especially where the roads crossed the swamps on cause ways that traverse the lowlands, which are overflowed arti ficially for the culture of rice. When within fifteen miles of the city, the columns were confronted by earthworks and artillery, in addition to the ordinary obstructions of the roads"], [296, "282 THE MARCH TO THE SEA. and causeways. But these defenses were easily turned, and on the 10th of December, the enemy was driven within the fortifications of Savannah, and its investment in great part ac complished. The right and left wings closed in with connected lines near the main defenses of the city. The left of the Twen tieth Corps rested on the Savannah river, and the right of the Fourteenth Corps connected with the left of the Seventeenth, beyond the canal, nearLawson's plantation. General Slocum held the bridge of the Charleston railroad and the river itself, and General Howard controlled the Gulf railroad and the Ogeechee down toward Fort McAllister. Thus General Sher man held firmly all the railroads centering in Savannah, and the two rivers forming the main channels of supply, and all the roads leading out from the city, except the Union cause way, over which the road to Hardeeville and Charleston passes from the shore of the river opposite the town. General Slocum grasped the Savannah river firmly with his left flank, at a point about five miles from the city, and planted batteries so as to command the channel. He was scarcely in position, when Captain Gildersleeve, of the One Hundred and Fiftieth New York, in command of a foraging party, captured the steamer Ida, having on board Colonel Lynch of General Hardee's staff, bearing dispatches to the gunboats up the river. This boat was burned, to prevent recapture by the gunboats patrolling the river below. Near General Slocum's left flank were two river islands, Hutchinson and Argyle, whose pos session was essential to his complete mastery of the river. These he promptly seized. During the evening of the 16th, Colonel Hawley, of the Third Wisconsin, from Carman's bri gade, by order of General Williams, sent over two companies of his regiment to Argyle Island, and the next morning six more. While he was crossing with the latter, he discovered three steamers descending the river. He hastened across, while Winegar's battery from the Georgia shore opened upon them. The boats were driven back, and in turning the two gunboats disabled their armed tender, which fell into Hawley's hands, at the head of the island. The next day, Geueral Geary, commanding First division Twentieth Corps, was di rected to occupy the upper end of Hutchinson Island with a"], [297, "283 THE MARCH TO THE SEA. detachment, to prevent the approach of the enemy's gunboats. A sunken battery was also established on the Georgia shore, whose guns commanded the river above and below the island, and ranged over the island to the Carolina shore. The defenses of the enemy had by this time been thoroughly developed by reconnoissances along the whole front of the in vesting lines, and it was apparent that by means of irrigating canals, traversing the rice plantations, the whole region could be so flooded as greatly to embarrass the advance of assaulting columns. It was equally apparent that there were but two ways to take the city, by assault between the rivers, or the completion of the investment by closing the road to Charles ton, which was General Hardee's only avenue of escape, and force a capitulation by starvation. Before, however, attempting either an assault or the com pletion of the investment, General Sherman made a successful effort to open communications with the fleet known to be in waiting for his coming, to secure supplies by the passage of the boats on the Ogeechee river, to the rear of his encampments. He was not yet in need, as he had large herds of cattle, and his trains were filled with supplies, which had been gathered on the march from Atlanta and with what had been loaded in that city, and there was an open country for foraging in his rear. Still he deemed communication with the fleet to be of paramount importance. The barrier to this was Fort McAllister, a redoubt on the right bank of the Ogeechee, holding heavy guns, and to its reduction he addressed himself, while he intrusted the immediate investment to his subordi nate commanders. On the 13th, General Kilpatrick was sent over the Ogeechee on a pontoon bridge, under instructions to reconnoiter Fort McAllister and the inlets in that vicinity, and if practicable to take the fort ; subsequently he was di rected by General Sherman to examine St. Catherine's Sound and open communication with the fleet. General Kilpatrick having reported that Fort McAllister was manned by two hundred men, and the bridge over the Ogeechee, known as \"King's Bridge,\" having been repaired in an incredibly short time by Colonel Buell and his regiment \u2014 the Fifty-eighth In diana, famous in the Army of the Cumberland for such ex-"], [298, "284 THE MARCH TO THE SEA. ploits \u2014 General Hazen, commanding the Second division of the Fifteenth Army Corps, was ordered to be in readiness to move against the fort. Early on the 13th, General Hazen crossed King's bridge, and deployed his division before the posi tion, with its flanks resting on the river. Having at 3 P. m. signaled his readiness for assault to General Sherman, who, with General Howard, had taken post at Chase's rice-mill for observation and direction, he received orders to make the attack. In compliance, General Hazen assaulted at 5 p. m. ; his troops broke through the abatis and leaped over the para pet, announcing their victory by shouts and the elevation of the national flag. While observing Hazen's operations, Gen eral Sherman caught sight of a steamer, which came to herald the proximity of the fleet at the very moment that the Ogeechee was opened for its use. Supplies were now assured, and the reduction of Savannah was the immediate problem for solu tion. The day following, Generals Sherman and Foster, the latter commanding the forces in South Carolina, met Admiral Dahl gren in conference, and arranged for co-operative movements against Savannah. Siege-guns wrere to be brought from Hilton Head ; the fleet was to bombard the lower forts, and the investing forces were to carry the landward defenses of the city. At this time General Sherman thought that he could reach the \" Union Causeway \" \u2014 General Hardee's only way of escape from his left flank \u2014 by throwing a column across the Savannah river. He therefore returned from the fleet, with announced determination to assault the lines of the enemy as soon as the promised siege-guns should arrive. On the 17th, General Sherman demanded the surrender of the city ; but on the next day received a positive refusal from General Hardee, who reminded him that his investment was not complete, that his guns were four miles from Sa vannah, and that there would be no justification for capitu lation while he had an open road to Charleston. He had probably less than fifteen thousand men, a force that was in adequate for successful defense against the armies and fleet that were converging upon him, but the issue proved that the necessity of surrender did not exist."], [299, "285 THE MARCH TO THE SEA. The problem of reducing Savannah was not the only one which now engrossed the attention of General Sherman, as a greater one had been devolved upon him by General Grant \u2014 one in comparison with which the other was merely inciden tal. This was the movement of General Sherman's army, to assist in the reduction of Richmond. But as this enterprise was contingent upon the accumulation of vessels sufficient to transport fifty or sixty thousand men, the operations against Savannah were continued as though its capture was paramount, except that the ulterior objective induced General Sherman to refrain from throwing one of General Slocum's corps across to South Carolina. Pending the opening of the Ogeechee and the coming of the siege-guns, there was some activity on the left flank of the army, and General Slocum was urgent to throw one of his corps into South Carolina, to close General Hardee's only avenue of escape. On the 15th, Colonel Hawley crossed to the Carolina shore from Argyle Island, with five companies, drove the enemy from Izzard's plantation, and made a recon noissance of the country two miles farther. Being isolated, he thought it prudent to return, and in doing this he was vig orously pressed by the enemy, but recrossed to the island in safety. Upon his return, he was reinforced by the Second Massachusetts regiment, and on the next day the remainder of the brigade, Colonel Carman commanding, and a section of artillery, crossed to the island and took position on the eastern point near the South Carolina shore. During the night, Colonel Carman received orders from General Williams to cross to South Carolina and take position near the river, threatening the Savannah and Charleston road. This was not accomplished immediately for want of small boats, and barges could not be used on account of low tide. In the meantime, General Wheeler appeared on the opposite shore, and opened with his light guns upon Carman's troops, the lat ter responding during the 17th and 18th, but made no effort to cross. In view of these revelations, General Sherman abandoned the idea of closing the road to Charleston by operations from his left flank, as the enemy held the river opposite the city"], [300, "286 THE MARCH TO THE SEA. with iron-clad gunboats, and could, as was conjectured, de stroy pontoons between Hutchinson Island and the Carolina shore, and isolate any force sent from that flank. Upon the abandonment of this movement, General Slocum was ordered to get the siege-guns into position and make preparations for assault. The approaches to the city were upon the narrow causeways, which were commanded by artil lery ; but nevertheless the reconnoissance from the left wing had convinced General Slocum and his subordinate command ers that the works in their front could be carried. Two of General Howard's division commanders were confident they could attack successfully, though the conditions of assault on their portion of the line was less favorable than on the left. In abandoning the purpose to close the Charleston road from his left flank, General Sherman did not forego the at tempt to shut it from another direction, as it was then threat ened by one of General Foster's divisions from the head of Broad river, and on the 19th he set sail for Port Royal to arrange with General Foster for a movement upon the cause way, so vital to General Hardee. His instructions, at depart ure, to Generals Howard and Slocum were to get ready, but not to strike until his return. At daybreak on the morning of the 19th, by order of Gen eral Williams, commanding the Twentieth Corps, Colonel Carman threw the Third Wisconsin, the Second Massachu setts, and the Thirteenth New York regiments, under Colonel Hawley, to the South Carolina shore. These troops landed without opposition, and advancing to Izzard's mill, skirmished into a good position. The enemy expressed his appreciation of the position, which he had lost, by charging with his cav alry to regain it, but suffered repulse. During the afternoon and evening, Colonel Carman sent forward the remaining reg iments of his brigade, and assumed command at Izzard's mill. His position was a strong one for defense, but the ground be fore him presented marked obstacles to an advance. His front was a rice plantation, traversed by canals and dikes, the fields being overflowed to the depth of eighteen inches. To move forward under these circumstances, it was necessary to follow the dikes, and these were easily defended. During the night"], [301, "287 THE MARCH TO THE SEA. he intrenched his line, which extended from the Savannah river, on his right, two and a quarter miles, to an inlet near Clyesdale creek. The next moi-ning, in obedience to orders from General Jackson, his division commander, Colonel Carman detailed twelve companies under Colonel Hawley, and directed in per son a reconnoissance to determine the relation of his line to Clyesdale creek. This creek was reached, with loss of one man. Works were then constructed for a regiment ; two com panies were left to hold them, and with the remainder of the force an effort was made to reach the Charleston road. This movement had been anticipated by the enemy, and a strong force had been thrown before Carman. As he could not ad vance without crossing a canal under fire, he withdrew, but remained sufficiently near the road to observe the passage of vehicles of all descriptions, in motion toward Charleston. During the afternoon he was shelled by a gunboat, and at 4 p. M. he was reinforced by three regiments. He was so neap the enemy's pontoon bridge, at Savannah, that from 7 P. M. to 3 A. M. he could distinctly hear the retreating army crossing upon it. This noise was also heard by General Geary from his position below Hutchinson's Island. These facts were duly reported. Thus, under the mantle of darkness, during a moonless and windy night, General Hardee withdrew his entire force along the front of a brigade of the investing army. The approach of this brigade to his only line of retreat may have hastened his withdrawal; but his final haste, whatever its immediate cause, was his salvation, and his stay at Savannah for ten days with such possibilities in his rear, vindicates him from the charge of abandoning his post before there was abso lute need. General Sherman returned on the 22d, to find the city of Savannah in the quiet possession of his army. General Hardee had destroyed as much of his material as the security of his retreat permitted ; but he left his guns unspiked, three steamboats, his railroad rolling-stock, twenty-five thousand bales of cotton belonging to the Confederate government, and"], [302, "288 THE MARCH TO THE SEA. vast quantities of other public property of great value, un injured. Except the failure to capture General Hardee's army at Savannah and release the prisoners at Millin, the march from Atlanta to that city was a triumphant success \u2014 the full realization of all anticipated possibilities. It illustrated with fearful emphasis the weakness of the rebellion, for no force able to resist one of General Sherman's thirteen divisions was met on the way. It left a track of desolation forty miles wide ; broke up the railroad system of Georgia and of the South, by the destruction of three hundred miles of track, all work- shops, station-houses, tanks, and warehouses ; crippled the industries of the empire state of the South, by burning all the mills and factories on the broad belt of ruin, and made other- wise a heavy draft upon the resources of the people, in con- suming and transporting supplies in immense quantities, and by the destruction of twenty thousand bales of cotton. The .general significance of these results spread gloom and despair over the South. Coupled with the victory at Nashville, \" The March to the Sea \" brought near the collapse of the rebellion. The death-throes of treason, organized in magnitude most grand, were subsequently in harmony with its proportions and persistence ; but all doubt of its quick destruction was now removed. When General Lee should surrender, the end would come ; and to hasten this result, the victorious Western armies were under orders to move northward by sea or land, as circumstances should determine.

All appearances still indicate that Beauregard has got back to his old hole at Corinth, and I hope he will enjoy it. My army prefers to enjoy the fresh sweet-potato fields of the Ocmulgee. I have balanced all the figures well, and am sat isfied that General Thomas has in Tennessee a force sufficient for all prob abilities ; and I have urged him, the moment Beauregard turns south, to \u25a0cross the Tennessee at Decatur, and push straight for Selma.

General : \u2014 I am directed by the general-in-chief to write you as follows: The march of this wing has been, since leaving Atlanta, in two columns, and very successful up to this time. The Fourteenth Corps is now on the Hillsboro road, ten (10) ten miles west of Milledgeville, and' the Twentieth Corps must now be in the capital, having marched by the Eaton ton road. The Georgia railroad, from and including the Oconee bridge, west of Lithonia, is well destroyed. Troops in fine condition, having fed high on sweet potatoes and poultry. Stock is also doing well, though the roads have been very heavy. The general desires you will report to him .at Milledgeville to-morrow (where he will go early), in detail, your oper ations since leaving Atlanta, and also the position of your command, in view of his making further orders. In the meantime, you can not do too much permanent damage to that railroad east of Macon and about Gordon. You will also notify General Kilpatrick a similar report is de sired of him. I am, general, respectfully yours, etc., L. M. DAYTON, Aid-de-Camp. General Howard, Commanding Army of the Tennessee. [SPECIAL FIELD ORDERS, NO. 127.] Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, Milledgeville, Ga., November 23, 1864.

I. General Kilpatrick, with his cavalry command, unincumbered by wagons, will move, via Milledgeville, by the most practicable route east ward, break the railroad between Millin and Augusta, then turn and strike the railroad below Millin ; after which he will use all possible effort to rescue our prisoners of war now confined near Millin. He will com municate back to the wings of the army, as often as it is safe, any infor mation of roads and the enemy that may be of interest to them. II. The right wing, General Howard, will move substantially along, but south of the railroad, to a point opposite Sandersville, breaking and de stroying in the most thorough manner the railroad and telegraph; at which point further orders will be issued. III. The left wing, General Slocum, will move directly from Milledge ville to the railroad opposite Sandersville, and at once commence de stroying the railroad forward to the Ogeechee. IV. Great attention should be paid to the destruction of this road, as it is of vital importance to our cause. Besides burning bridges and trestles, the iron should be carefully twisted and warped, so that it will be impossible ever to use it again; to this end, the rate of travel will be reduced to ten miles a day. VI. The general-in-chief will accompany the left wing until it reaches Sandersville, when he will join the Army of the Tennessee. By order of Major-General W. T. Sherman. L. M. DAYTON, Aid-de-Camp. Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, Milledgeville, Ga., November 23, 1864.

You may lay your pontoon over the Oconee, but do not cross any of your command until further orders. Hardee has probably swung around, via Albany, for Savannah, which, the general says, is all right, and he do n't care particularly. Kilpatrick will be moved here or in this vicinity for the present. The probability is we will concentrate at or near Sandersville. Prosecute the railroad destruction in the most thorough manner, and communicate with the general-in-chief frequently. I am, general, respectfully yours, etc., L. M. DAYTON, Aid-de-Camp."], [307, "293 THE MARCH TO THE SEA. Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, near Millin, Ga., December 2, 1864. General : \u2014 The army will move on Savannah, delaying only to continue the destruction of the railroad from Millin as far as Ogeechee Church. General Howard will continue to move along the south bank of the Ogeechee, General Blair along the railroad, and General Slocum by the two roads lying north of the railroad, between it and the Savannah river. The general wishes you to confer with General Slocum, to make a strong feint up in the direction of Waynesboro, and then to cover his rear from molestation by dashes of cavalry.

DAYTON, Aid-de-Camp. General Kilpatrick, Commanding Cavalry Division. Headquarters Armies of the United States, City Point, Va., December 3, 1864 General: \u2014 The little information gleaned from the Southern press in dicating no great obstacle to your progress, I have directed your mails, which previously had been collected in Baltimore, by Colonel Markland, special agent of the post-office department, to be sent as far as the blockad ing squadron off Savannah, to be forwarded to you as soon as heard from on the coast. Not liking to rejoice before the victory is assured, I abstain from congratulating you and those under your command until bottom has been struck. I have never had a fear, however, for the result. Since you left Atlanta, no very great progress has been made here. The enemy has been closely watched though, and prevented from de taching against you. I think not one man has gone from here, except some twelve or fifteen hundred dismounted cavalry. Bragg has gone from Wilmington. I am trying to take advantage of his absence to get pos session of that place. Owing to some preparations Admiral Porter and General Butler are making to blow up Fort Fisher, and which, while I hope for the best, do not believe a particle in, there is delay in getting this expedition off. I hope they will be ready to start by the 7th, and that Bragg will not have started back by that time. In this letter I do not intend to give you anything like directions for future action, but will state a general idea I have, and will get your views after you have established yourself on the sea-coast. With your veteran army I hope to get control of the only two through routes from east to west, possessed by the enemy before the fall of Atlanta. This condition will be filled by holding Savannah and Augusta, or by holding any other post to the east of Savannah and Branchville. If Wilmington falls, a force from there can co-operate with you."], [308, "294 THE MARCH TO THE SEA. Thomas has got back into the defenses of Nashville, with Hood close upon him. Decatur has been abandoned, and so have all the roads, ex cept the main one leading to Chattanooga. . . I hope Hood will be badly crippled or destroyed. After all becomes quiet, and the roads up here so bad that there is likely to be a week or two that nothing can be done, I will run down to the coast and see you. U. S. GRANT, Lieutenan t- General. Major-General W. T. Sherman, Commanding Armies near Savannah. Headquarters Armies of the United States-, City Point, Va., December 6, 1864. General: \u2014 On reflection, since sending my letter by the hands of Lieutenant Dunn, I have concluded that the most important operation toward closing out the great rebellion will be to close out Lee and his army. You have now destroyed the roads of the South, so that it will probably take them months, without interruption, to re-establish a through line from east to west. In that time, I think, the job here will be effectually completed. My idea now is, that you establish a base on the coast, fortify and leave it to your artillery and cavalry, and enough infantry to protect them, and at the same time so threaten the interior that the militia of the South will have to be kept at home. With the balance of your command come here by water, with all dispatch. Select yourself the officer to leave in command, but you I want in person. Unless you see objections to this plan which I can not see, use every vessel going to you for the purpose of transportation. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, U. S.

Howard, Commanding Army of the Tennessee."], [309, "THE MARCH TO THE SEA. 295 Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, near Savannah, December 16, 1864. General : \u2014 I received day before yesterday, at the hands of Lieutenant Dunn, your letter of December 3d, and last night, at the hands of Col onel Babcock, that of December 6th. I had previously made you a hasty scrawl from the tugboat Dandelion in Ogeechee river, advising you that the army had reached the sea-coast, destroying all railroads across the State of Georgia, and investing closely the city of Savannah, and had made connection with the fleet. Since writing that note, I have in person met and conferred with Gen- eral Foster and Admiral Dahlgren, and made arrangements which I deemed essential to reduce the city of Savannah to our possession ; but since the receipt of yours of the 6th, I have measures looking principally to coming to you with fifty or sixty thousand (50,000 or 60,000) infantry, and incidentally to take Savannah, if time will allow. At the time we carried Fort McAllister so handsomely by assault, with twenty- two (22) guns and its entire garrison, I was hardly aware of its importance ; but since passing down the river with General Foster, and up with Ad- miral Dahlgren, I realize how admirably adapted are Ossabaw Sound and Ogeechee river to supply an army operating against Savannah. Sea-going vessels can easily come to King's bridge, a point on the Ogeechee river, fourteen and a half (14J) miles due west from Savannah, from which point we have roads leading to all our camps. The country is low and sandy, and cut up with marshes, which in wet weather will be very bad, but we have been so favored with weather that they are all now compar- atively good, and heavy details are constantly employed in double cordu- roying the marshes, so that I have no fear of a bad spell of weather. Fortunately, also, by liberal 'and judicious foraging, we reached the sea- coast abundantly supplied with forage and provisions, needing nothing on arrival except bread. Of this we started from Atlanta with from eight to twenty (8 to 20) days' supply for corps, and some of the troops had only one (1) day's issue of bread during the trip of thirty (30) days, and yet they did not want, for sweet-potatoes were very abundant, as well as corn-meal, and our soldiers took to them naturally. We started with about five thousand (5,000) head of cattle, and arrived with over ten thousand (10,000) ; of course consuming mostly turkeys, chickens, sheep, hogs, and the cattle of the country. As for our mules and horses, we left Atlanta with about two thousand five hundred (2,500) wagons, many of which were drawn by mules which had not recovered from the Chattanooga starva- tion ; all of which were replaced, the poor mules shot, and our transporta- tion is now in superb condition. I have no doubt the State of Georgia has lost by our operations fifteen thousand (15,000) first-rate mules. As to horses, Kilpatrick collected all his remounts, and it looks to me, in riding along our columns, as though every officer has three or four led horses, and each regiment seems to be followed by at least fifty (50) negroes and foot-sore soldiers, riding on horses and mules. The custom was for each brigade to send out daily a foraging party of about fifty (50)"], [310, "296 THE MARCH TO THE SEA. men on foot, who invariably returned mounted, with several wagons' loaded with poultry, potatoes, etc., and as the army is composed of about forty (40) brigades, you can estimate approximately the quantity of horses collected. Great numbers of these were shot by my orders, because of the disorganizing effect on our infantry of having too many idlers mounted. General Easton is now engaged in collecting statistics on this subject ; but I know that the government will never receive full accounts of our cap tures, although the result aimed at was fully attained, viz., to deprive our enemy of them. All .these animals I will have sent to Port Royal, or col lected behind Fort McAllister, to be used by General Saxton in his farm ing operations, or by the quartermaster's department, after they are sys tematically accounted for. While General Easton is collecting transportation for my troops to James river, I will throw to Port Royal Island all of our means of trans portation I can, and collect the balance near Fort McAllister, covered by the Ogeechee river and intrenchments to be erected, and for which Cap tain Poe, my chief engineer, is now reconnoitering the grounds ; but, in the meantime, I will act as I have begun, as though Savannah city were my only objective \u2014 namely, the troops will continue to invest Savannah closely, making attacks and feints wherever we have firm ground to stand upon ; and I will place some thirty (30) pounder Parrots, which I have got from General Foster, in position near enough to reach the center of the city, and then will demand its surrender. If General Hardee is alarmed, or fears starvation, he may surrender; otherwise, I will bombard the city, but not risk the lives of my own men by assaults across the narrow causeways, by which alone we can reach it. If I had time, Savannah, with all its dependent fortifications, is already ours, for we hold all its avenues of supply. The enemy has made two desperate efforts to get boats from above to the city, in both of which he has been foiled ; General Slocum, whose left flank rests on the river, capturing and burning the first boat, and in the second instance driving back two gunboats and capturing the steamer Resolute, with seven naval officers and a crew of twenty-five sea men. General Slocum occupies Argyle Island and the upper end of Hutchinson Island, and has a brigade on the South Carolina shore oppo site, and he is very urgent to pass one of his corps over to that shore. But in view of the change of plan made necessary by your orders of the 6th, I will maintain things in sialu quo till 1 have got all my transporta tion to the rear and out of the way, and until I have sea transportation for the troops you require at James river, which I will accompany and com mand in person. Of course, I will leave Kilpatrick with his cavalry, say five thousand three hundred (5,300), and, it may be, a division of the Fifteenth Corps ; but before determining this, I must see General Foster, and may arrange to shift his force \u2014 now over about the Charleston railroad, at the head of Broad river \u2014 to the Ogeechee, where, in co-operation with Kilpat rick's cavalry, he can better threaten the State of Georgia than from the direction of Port Royal. Besides, I would much prefer not to detach from my regular corps any of its veteran divisions, and would even prefer"], [311, "297 THE MARCH TO THE SEA. that other less valuable troops should be sent to reinforce Foster, from some other quarter. My four (4) corps, full of experience and full of ardor, coming to you en masse, equal to sixty thousand (60,000) fighting men, will be a reinforcement that Lee can not disregard. Indeed, with my present command, I had expected, after reducing Savannah, instantly to march to Columbia, South Carolina, thence to Raleigh, and thence to report to you. But this would consume, it may be, six weeks' time, after the fall of Savannah, whereas, by sea, I can probably reach you with my men and arms before the middle of January. As to matters in the Southeast, I think Hardee in Savannah has good artillerists, some five thousand (5,000) or six thousand (6,000) good infan try, and it may be, a mongrel mass of eight thousand or ten thousand (8,000 or 10,000) militia and fragments. In all our marching through Georgia, he has not forced me to use anything but a skirmish line, though at several points he had erected fortifications and made bombastic threats. In Savannah, he has taken refuge in a line constructed behind swamps and overflowed rice-fields, extending from a point on the Savan nah river, about three miles above the city, around to -a branch of the Little Ogeechee, which stream is impassable from its salt marshes and boggy swamps, crossed only by narrow causeways or common corduroy roads. There must be twenty-five thousand (25,000) citizens, men, women, and children, in Savannah, that must also be fed, and how he is to feed them beyond a few days, I can not imagine, as I know that his requisitions for corn, on the interior counties of Georgia were not filled, and we are in possession of the rice fields and mills, which alone could be of service to him in' this neighborhood. He can draw nothing from South Carolina, save from a small corner down in the southeast, and that by a disused wagon-road. I could easily get posession of this, but hardly deem it worth the risk of making a detachment, which would be in danger by its isolation from the main army. Our whole army is in fine condition as to health, and the weather is splendid. For that reason alone I feel a personal dislike to turning northward. I will keep Lieutenant Dunn here until I know the result of my de mand for the surrender of Savannah; but, whether successful or not, shall not delay my execution of your orders of the 6th, which will de pend alone upon the time it will require to get transportation by sea.

Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, near Savannah, Ga., December 17, 1864. General : \u2014 You have doubtless observed from your station at Rosedew that sea-going vessels now come through Ossabaw Sound and the Ogeechee to the rear of my army, giving me abundant supplies of all kinds, and"], [312, "298 THE MARCH TO THE SEA. more especially of heavy ordnance necessary to the reduction of Savan nah. I have already received guns that can cast heavy and destructive shot as far as the heart of your city ; also, I have for some days held and controlled every avenue by which the people and garrison of Savannah can be supplied, and I am therefore justified in demanding the surrender of the city of Savannah and its dependent forts, and shall await a reason able time your answer before opening with heavy ordnance. Should you entertain the proposition, I am prepared to grant liberal terms to the in habitants and garrison; but should I be forced to resort to assault, or the slower and surer process of starvation, I shall then feel justified in resort ing to the harshest measures, and shall make little effort to restrain my army burning to avenge the great national wrong they attach to Savan nah and other large cities, which have been prominent in dragging our country into civil war. I inclose you a copy of General Hood's demand for the surrender of the town of Resaca, to be used by you for what it is worth. I have the honor to be, your obedient servant, W. T. SHERMAN, Major- General. General William J. Hardee, Commanding Confederate Forces in Savannah. Headquarters Department South Carolina and Georgia and Florida, Savannah, Ga., December 17, 1864. Major-General W. T. Sherman, Commanding Federal Forces near Savannah : General: \u2014 I have to acknowledge receipt of a communication from you of this date, in which you demand \"the surrender of Savannah and its dependent forts,\" on the ground that you \" have received guns that can cast heavy and destructive shot into the heart of the city;\" and for the further reason that you \"have for some days held and controlled every avenue by which the people and garrison can be supplied.\" You add, that should you \"be forced to resort to assault, or to the slower and surer process of starvation, you will then feel justified in resorting to the harshest measures, and will make little effort to restrain your army,\" etc., etc. The position of your forces half a mile beyond the outer line for the land defense of Savannah is, at the nearest point, at least four miles from the heart of the city. That and the interior line are intact. Your statement' that you have for some days held and controlled every avenue by which the people and garrison can be supplied is incorrect. I am in free and constant communication with my department. Your demand for the surrender of Savannah and its dependent forts is refused. With respect to the threats conveyed in the closing paragraph of your letter, of what may be expected in case your demand is not complied with, I have to say that I have hitherto conducted the military opera-"], [313, "299 THE MARCH TO THE SEA. tions intrusted to my direction in strict accordance with the rules of civilized warfare, and I should deeply regret the adoption of any course by you that may force me to deviate from them in future. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, Your obedient servant, W. J. HARDEE, Lieutenant- General. Headquarters Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, near Savannah, Ga., December 18, 1864. General: \u2014 I wrote you at length by Colonel Babcock on the 16th instant. As I therein explained my purpose, yesterday I made a demand on General Hardee for the surrender of the city of Savannah, and to-day received his answer refusing. Copies of both letters are herewith inclosed. You will notice that I claim that my lines are within easy range of the heart of Savannah, but General Hardee claims we are four and a half miles dis tant. But I myself have been to the intersection of the Charleston and Georgia railroad and the three (3) mile post is but a few yards beyond, within the line of our picket. The enemy has no pickets outside of his fortified line, which is a full quarter of a mile within the three (3) mile post, and I have the evidence of Mr. R. R. Cuyler, president of the Georgia Central railroad, who was a prisoner in our hands, that the mile posts are measured from the Exchange, which is but two squares from the river. . . . General Slocum feels confident that he can make a successful assault at one or two points in front of the Twentieth Corps and one or two in front of General Davis' (Fourteenth) Corps. But all of General Howard's troops, the right wing lie behind the Little Ogeechee, and I doubt if it can be passed by troops in the face of an enemy. Still we can make strong feints, and if I can get a sufficient number of boats, I shall make a co-operative demonstration up Vernon river or Wassaw Sound. I should like very much to take Savannah before coming to you; but, as I wrote to you before, I will do nothing rash or hasty, and will embark for the James river as soon as General Easton, who is gone to Port Royal for that purpose, reports to me that he has an approximate number of vessels for the transportation of the contemplated force. . . In relation to Savannah you will remark that General Hardee refers to his still being in communication with his war department. This lan guage he thought would deceive me, but I am confirmed in the belief that the route to which he refers \u2014 namely, the Union plank-road, on the South Carolina shore \u2014 is inadequate to feed his army and the people of Savannah, for General Foster assures me that he has his force on that very road near the head of Broad river, and that his guns command the railroad, so that cars no longer run between Charleston and Savannah. We hold this end of the Charleston road, and have destroyed it from the three (3) mile post back to the bridge, about twelve (12) miles above. . . I do sincerely believe that the whole United States, North and South,"], [314, "300 THE MARCH TO THE SEA. would rejoice to have this army turned loose on South Carolina, to de vastate that state in the manner we have done in Georgia, and it would have a direct and immediate bearing on your campaign in Virginia.

In the meantime, further reconnoissances from our left flank had de monstrated that it was impracticable or unwise to push any considerable force across the Savannah river, for the enemy held the river opposite the city with iron-clad gunboats, and could destroy any pontoons laid down by us between Hutchinson's Island and the South Carolina shore, which would isolate any force sent over from that flank. I therefore ordered"], [315, "301 THE MARCH TO THE SEA. General Slocum to get into position the siege-guns, and make all the preparations necessary to assault, and to report to me the earliest moment when he could be ready, whilst I should proceed rapidly round by the right, and make arrangements to occupy the Union causeway, from the direction of Port Royal. General Foster had already established a divis ion of troops on the peninsula or neck between the Coosawhatchie and Tullifinney rivers, at the head of Broad river, from which position he could reach the railroad with his artillery. I went to Port Royal in person, and made arrangements to reinforce that command by one or more divisions, under a proper officer, to assault and carry the railroad, and thence turn toward Savannah, until it occupied the causeway in question. EXTRACT FROM GENERAL HOWARD'S REPORT. It having been intimated that our future plans would be modified by specific instructions from the commander-in-chief, General Sherman and his officers became anxious to crown our success by the capture of Savan nah. In order to accomplish this, every exertion was made. Heavy guns were brought from Hilton Head and McAllister, and placed in position ; the lines were worked up closer to the enemy, along the dikes; good batteries constructed for small guns, and every part of the front of General Oster haus and General Blair thoroughly reconnoitered; light bridges were constructed, and fascines made, so as to span the streams and fill up the ditches ; in brief, every possible preparation was made to assault the en emy's works. The same was the case along General Slocum's front. While these preparations were going on, the general-in-chief, having demanded the surrender of Savannah on the 18th instant, and having been refused, had gone to the fleet, in order to secure co-operation from the admiral and General Foster, in the contemplated attack. He left di rections to get ready, but not to strike till his return. Two at least of my division commanders felt perfectly confident of success, in case the assault should be made. EXTRACT FROM GENERAL SLOCUM'S REPORT. Our line was established as close as possible to that of the enemy, and the time spent in preparations for an assault upon his works. Batteries were established on the river, in such positions as prevented any boats from passing. The steamer Ida, while attempting to pass up from Savan nah, on the 10th of December, was captured and burned. On the 12th, two gunboats and the steamer Resolute attempted to pass our batteries from above, but both gunboats were driven back by Winegar's battery, and the steamer was so disabled that she fell into our hands. She was soon repaired, and has since been transferred to the quartermaster's de partment"], [316, "302 THE MARCH TO THE SEA. On the 18th, a brigade of the First division, Twentieth Corps, was thrown across the river, and established near Izzard's plantation, on the South Carolina shore, in a position which threatened the only line of communi cation still held by the enemy. A bridge, in the meantime, had been constructed by the enemy from the city to the South Carolina shore, and on the evening of December 20th he commenced the evacuation of the city. EXTRACT FROM THE REPORT OF GENERAL WILLIAMS. During the day of the 20th, the fire from the enemy's works and gun boats was unusually heavy and continuous. Reports from Carman's brig ade, that large columns were crossing to the Carolina shore, either to cover their only line of communication, or preparatory to a final evacuation of the city. In the night, General Geary reported to me that the movements across the river were still apparently going on. EXTRACT FROM GENERAL GEARY'S REPORT. I ascertained this morning, the 20th, that the enemy had completed a pontoon bridge across to the South Carolina shore, from Savannah, and notified the general commanding the corps of the discovery. This bridge was about two and a half miles from my left. The usual artillery fire was kept up by the enemy during the day and night. During the night, I heard the movement of troops and wagons across the pontoon bridge before mentioned, and sent a report of the fact to the general command ing the corps. EXTRACT FROM GENERAL JEFF. C. DAVIS' REPORT. During the intervening days between the 12th and 21st, at which time the enemy evacuated his position, my troops were assiduously engaged in skirmishing with the enemy, reconnoitering his position, and making general preparations for an attack. Five (5) points in my front had, several days before the evacuation, been reconnoitered, and pronounced accessible to an attacking party. This information was duly forwarded to the commanding general. EXTRACTS FROM COLONEL CARMAN'S REPORT. I then moved the remaining regiment of the brigade \u2014 One Hundred and Fiftieth New York Volunteers\u2014 to the South Carolina shore, and es tablished there my headquarters at Izzard's mill. The position occupied by the brigade was strong for defense, but the nature of the ground was such that an advance was difficult. . . . During the night, I transported the two pieces of artillery across the river, and put them in position in the center of the line. The line as"], [317, "THE MARCH TO THE SEA. 303 then formed and held by my brigade was two and a quarter miles long, the left resting on the Savannah river, and the right on an inlet near Clyesdale creek. . . . December 20. . . . During the day, a great number of vehicles of all descriptions were seen passing our front, moving from Savannah toward HardeeVille, which was reported to the headquarters of the division. In the afternoon, a rebel gunboat came up the river in our rear, and threw about thirty shells into my brigade, killing one man of the One Hundred and Fiftieth New York. I could reach it with my artillery. At 4 p. m. the enemy was reinforced by three regiments of infantry from Savannah. From 7 p. m. until 3 a. m. the noise of the retreating enemy could plainly be heard as they crossed the bridges from Savannah to the South Carolina shore. Charleston, S. C. , December 8, 1864. Lieutenant-General Hardee, Savannah, Ga. : Having no army of relief to look to, and your forces being essential to the defense of Georgia and South Carolina, whenever you shall have to select between their safety and that of Savannah, sacrifice the latter, and form a junction with General Jones, holding the left bank of the Savan nah river and the railroad to this place as long as possible. G. T. BEAUREGARD. Headquarters of the Army, Washington, December 16, 1864. General : \u2014 Lieutenant-General Grant informs me that in his last dis patch sent to you, he suggested the transfer of your infantry to Rich mond. He now wishes me to say that you will retain your entire force, at least for the present, and, with such assistance as may be given you by General Foster and Admiral Dahlgren, operate from such base as you may establish on the coast. General Foster will obey such instructions as may be given by you. Should you have captured Savannah, it is thought that by transferring the water-batteries to the land side, that place may be made a good depot and base for operations on Augusta, Branchville, or Charleston. If Savannah should not be captured, or if captured and not deemed suitable for this purpose, perhaps Beaufort would serve as a depot. As the rebels have probably removed their most valuable property from Augusta, perhaps Branchville would be the most im portant point at which to strike in order to sever all connections between the Virginia and the Northwestern railroads. General Grant's wishes, how ever, are that this whole matter of your future actions should be left en tirely to your discretion. We can send you from here a number of complete batteries of field artillery, with or without horses, as you may desire. Also, as soon as General Thomas can spare them, all the fragments, convalescents, and"], [318, "304 THE MARCH TO THE SEA. furloughed men of your army. It is reported that Thomas defeated Hood yesterday near Nashville, but we have no particulars nor official reports, telegraphic communications being interrupted by a heavy storm. Our last advices from you were in General Howard's note, announcing his approach to Savannah. Yours truly, H. W. HALLECK, Major-General, Chief of Staff. Major-General Sherman, via Hilton Head. Headquarters of the Army, Washington, December 18, 1864. My Dear General: \u2014 Yours of the 13th, by Major Anderson, is just re ceived. I congratulate you on your splendid success, and shall very soon expect to hear of the crowning work of your new campaign, in the cap ture of Savannah. Your march will stand out prominently as the great one of this great war. When Savannah falls, then for another wide swath through the center of the Confederacy. But I will not anticipate. General Grant is expected here this morning, and will probably write you his own views. Orders have been issued for all officers and detachments, having three months or more to serve, to rejoin your army, via Savannah. Those hav ing less than three months to serve will be retained by General Thomas. Should you capture Charleston, I hope that by some accident the place may be destroyed; and if a little salt should be sown upon its site, it may prevent the growth of future crops of nullification and secession. Yours truly, H. W. HALLECK, Major-General, Chief of Staff. Major-General W. T. Sherman, Savannah. Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, Savannah, December 24, 1864. General: \u2014 I had the pleasure of receiving your two letters of the 16th and 18th instant to-day, and I feel more than usually flattered by the high encomiums you have passed on our recent campaign, which is now completed by the occupation of Savannah. I am very glad that General Grant has changed his mind about em barking my troops for James river, leaving me free to make the broad swath you describe through South and North Carolina, and am still more gratified at the news from Thomas in Tennessee, because it fulfills my plans, which contemplated his being fully able to dispose of Hood in case he ventured north of the Tennessee river. So I think, on the whole, I can chuckle over Jeff. Davis' disappointment in not turning my Atlanta campaign into a Moscow disaster."], [319, "305 THE MARCH TO THE SEA. I will bear in mind your hint as to Charleston, and don't think \" salt\" will be necessary. When I move, the Fifteenth Corps will be on the right of the right wing, and their position will naturally bring them into it first; and if you have watched the history of that corps, you will have re marked that they do their work up pretty well. The truth is, the whole army is burning with an insatiable desire to wreak vengeance upon South Carolina. I almost tremble at her fate, but feel that she deserves all that is in store for her. Many and many a person in Georgia asked me why we did not go to South Carolina; and when I answered that I was en route for that state, the invariable reply was, \"Well, if you make those people feel the severities of war, we will pardon you for your desolation of Georgia.\" I look upon Columbia as quite as bad as Charleston, and I doubt if we shall spare the public buildings there as we did at Milledge ville. I felt somewhat disappointed at Hardee's escape from me, but really am not to blame. I moved as quick as possible to close up the \" Union Causeway,\" but intervening obstacles were such, that before I could get my troops on the road, Hardee slipped out. Still, I know that the men that were in Savannah will be lost in a measure to Jeff. Davis ; for the Georgia troops under G. W. Smith declared they would not fight in South Carolina, and they have gone north en route for Augusta, and I have rea son to believe North Carolina troops have gone to Wilmington \u2014 in other words, they are scattered. W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General. Major-General H. W. Halleck, Chief of Staff, Washington, D. C. vol. n \u2014 20"], [320, "306 CHAPTER XXXVIII. MARCH THROUGH THE CAROLINAS, FROM SAVANNAH TO GOLDSBORO AND RALEIGH ; THE BATTLES OF AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE. Soon after the occupation of Savannah by General Sherman, the movement of his army by sea was abandoned, and its march through the Carolinas was adopted instead. General Sherman had indicated to General Grant, in his letter of De cember 16th, his preference for the overland movement, and in subsequent communications emphasized his choice. And in view of the apparent advantages of this approach to Vir ginia, General Grant authorized General Sherman, December 27th, to move his army northward through the Carolinas as soon as practicable. It was anticipated that this movement would prevent, in great measure, the union of the fragments of the defeated Confederate armies in the West and South, while it would repeat and intensify the effect produced by the march from Atlanta to Savannah. The plan adopted, com passed the permanent occupancy of Savannah by troops from a distance, that General Sherman might keep his army intact to be able to resist General Lee until General Grant could give him help from Virginia, should that general abandon the capital of the Confederacy to oppose him. The river defenses of Savannah, with slight modifications, were deemed adequate. Forts Pulaski, Thunderbolt, and McAllister were put in complete order. The forts bearing upon the approaches by water were dismantled, and their heavy guns sent to Tort Pulaski and Hilton Head. The obstructions, including torpedoes, were removed from the ad jacent waters, and Admiral Dahlgren had the channels staked out and indicated by buoys. Preparations were promptly"], [321, "307 AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE. commenced and energetically prosecuted, that the army might move northward by the 15th of January. A portion of General Sherman's forces did move before the 15th of January ; but rain, swollen rivers, and flooded low lands so delayed co-operative columns, that they did not cross the Savannah river until the first week of February. On the 14th, General Howard, wTith General Blair's corps, crossed from Beaufort Island to the main land, flanked the enemy at Gordon's Corner, and followed him to Pocotaligo, and on the following morning took possession of the vacant fort at that place. This movement was a feint upon Charleston, to deceive the enemy as to General Sherman's first and second objectives, which were Columbia, South Carolina, and Goldsboro, North Carolina. A pontoon bridge had been thrown at Savannah for the passage of the left wing, and the Union causeway had been repaired ; bat the flood in the river had borne away the bridge and submerged the causeway, and General Slocum was compelled to move up the river to find a crossing. Jackson's and Ward's divisions of the Twentieth Corps crossed at Purysburg, and on the 19th were at Hardeeville, in com munication with General Howard at Pocotaligo. The Four teenth Corps, and Geary's division of the Twentieth Corps, which had been relieved from garrison duty at Savannah, by General Grover's division of the Nineteenth Corps from Vir ginia, did not leave Savannah until the 26th of January. These troops then moved up to Sister's Ferry, and succeeded in crossing the river during the first week of February. In the meantime, the Fifteenth Corps, General John A. Logan commanding, had crossed the river and lowlands, and joined General Howard at Pocotaligo. General Sherman's forces were now in readiness to enter upon a campaign which involved strategic combinations of widest range. When the northward march was first indicated, Generals Bragg, Beauregard, and Hardee were intent upon concentrating all fragments of armies far and near to oppose it. Generals Beauregard and Hardee were in Charleston, and General Bragg was in North Carolina. North Carolina was open to attack from the coast, and"], [322, "308 AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE. thither General Schofield's corps of twenty-one thousand men from the West and other forces were to move. General Sher man had an offensive army of sixty-five thousand men, and forces in his rear to hold Savannah and garrison such other fortified places as should fall into his hands. Acting aggres sively on a broad field, with possible objectives in front, or right or left,. their antagonist could conceal his purposes, and strike vital points uncovered by invitation of feints in other directions. The disposition of his forces from Sister's Ferry to Pocotaligo menaced equally Charleston, Columbia, and Augusta, and which was General Sherman's immediate ob jective, the Confederate generals could not discern with cer tainty. And if they could have ascertained his aims, he could change them with pleasure with crushing effect. Having passed by Augusta in his march from Atlanta that he might menace that city with his left flank while feigning against Charleston with his right, to concentrate between the divided forces of the enemy upon Columbia as his first objective, he proposed that his two wings should shake hands where seces sion first found positive expression through the convention of South Carolina, and then stride on to Goldsboro and Rich mond. The inevitable delay at Savannah was favorable to the enemy, as it had given time for a sweeping conscription in the states immediately threatened, for the fragments of Hood's army to move far toward the Carolinas, and for Wheeler to obstruct the roads before General Sherman's columns, and destroy the bridges that could not be utilized for defense. These obstructions, the depth of the rivers, and the breadth of the immediate lowlands on their margins, doubtless gave hope to the enemy that the invasion of the Carolinas would be greatly delayed, if not defeated. But though the obstacles were almost insurmountable, General Sherman's victorious troops did not hesitate to make causeways in the deep cold waters for miles, nor to make roads through the swamps of South Carolina in midwinter, and made a march not inferior to the celebrated passage of the Alps, except in the low lines of advance. The infantry forces of the enemy occupied the line of the"], [323, "AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE. 309 Salkehatchie river, while Wheeler's cavalry hovered around the heads of column or on the fianks of the two wings. The left wing, with Kilpatrick on its left flank, moved upon Barn well, threatening Augusta ; the right wing, accompanied by General Sherman, moved westward to the Salkehatchie, touching the river at Beaufort and Rivers' bridges, flanking Charleston, and neutralizing the elaborate fortifications of that city, which had so long defied the heavy guns of iron-clads and land-batteries. The bridges of the Salkehatchie were de fended with spirit, but in vain ; and General Howard soon forced the passages, when the enemy retired to Branchville, burning all bridges behind him. These movements spread alarm everywhere. The Confederate forces were feeble at best, and there were now so many possibilities to General Sherman, all fruitful of ruin, that extreme uncertainty and foreboding of crushing disasters palsied the courage of troops and citizens. They could only guess at General Sherman's objective, and so many were possible and his strategy so be wildering that no positions were held with adequate strength for temporary resistance, and Columbia was uncovered almost entirely. General Sherman threw the Fifteenth and Seventeenth Corps on the Orangeburg road \u2014 the latter by Binnaker's bridge over the south fork of Edisto, and the former by Hol man's. Having reached Orangeburg, the right wing moved on the direct road to Columbia. The enemy was driven from all points where resistance was made, and on the 16th, the head of column approached the capital of South Carolina. The left wing advanced steadily by Barnwell and Lexington as the general direction, and destroyed the Charleston and Augusta railroad for several miles. After a well-sustained menace to Augusta, General Slocum gathered his forces and touched the Saluda river above Columbia simultaneously with the arrival of General Howard on the bank of the river oppo site the city. General Sherman's maneuvers resulted in marked success. Throwing his columns in diverging lines from Savannah, and then converging them upon Columbia, he caused the evacua tion of Charleston, and drove General Cheatham, moving"], [324, "310 AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE. eastward with the remnant of Hood's army, to the north of his projected line. It now remained to reach Goldsboro through repetition of the same confusing strategy; but the conditions of its success were now greatly changed, as the gar risons of Charleston, Columbia, and Augusta could be united with the Western troops and other forces on the Atlantic coast, and endanger isolated columns. Besides, a great strategist, General Joseph E. Johnston, had been appointed to the command of all the forces available to resist General Sher man, in tacit recognition of the fact that his management of defensive campaigns promised better results than that of any other general who could be assigned to command in the Car olinas ; but General Johnston's conduct of the defensive was now to be subject to conditions radically different from those of the Atlanta campaign. His army, as before, was inferior to that of General Sherman's, and was composed of fragmentary troops, whose morale was in harmony with the condition of the cause which they represented ; and, besides, he was to meet his old antagonist, with an army whose spirit had risen, if possible, with its successive triumphs, and not now, as before, restrained in maneuver by connection with a railroad as its only channel of supply. General Johnston could therefore have no hope of success, unless he could strike unsupported columns and defeat General Sherman in detail ; and past expe rience did not give promise of such an opportunity. In advancing from Columbia, General Sherman, as before, covered his real object by a menace in a different direction. He now directed General Slocum to threaten Charlotte, North Carolina, to create the impression that he would strike that point on his way to Virginia, while in reality directing his army to Goldsboro. Accordingly, General Slocum resumed motion on the 17th, crossed the Saluda at Mount Zion Church on the 19th, and Broad river at Freshley's mills the day fol lowing, and arrived at Winnsboro on the 21st. On this march the left wing and cavalry destroyed several miles of railroad north and south of Alston. The right wing, General Sherman accompanying, left Columbia on the 20th, on the direct road to Winnsboro, and destroyed the railroad between the two places. Eighty squares in Columbia were left in ashes from a"], [325, "AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE. 311 conflagration whose origin and progress has been a matter of historical controversy. , From Winnsboro the two wings again diverged. General Slocum moved to the north with his troops well spread out and then turned east, crossed the Catawba, and advanced to Sneedsboro. The cavalry on his left demonstrated toward Charlotte, and then followed to Sneedsboro. The right wing, in the meantime, advanced to Cheraw \u2014 the Seventeenth Corps entering that place on the 2d of March. The enemy offered some resistance, but did not retard a single column. Wheeler's cavalry and the forces from Charleston appeared at times before the columns. The other forces, including Cheatham's from the West, were directed to Charlotte, under the impres sion that this was the objective. From Pedee river the two wings moved toward Fayetteville, crossing near Sneedsboro and at Cheraw \u2014 the corps moving on separate roads, and the cavalry maintaining position on the left flank. On the 9th of March, General Hampton surprised one of General Kilpatrick's brigades, and gained a temporary advantage over his whole force. General Kilpatrick barely escaped capture on foot. The enemy, however, stopped to plunder the camps, and this gave time for the national cavalry to rally; and having done this, General Kilpatrick charged and recaptured his camps and repelled all subsequent attacks. General J. G. Mitchell, with his brigade of infantry, reached the scene of conflict just as the enemy abandoned his effort to regain his lost advantage. On the 11th, the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Corps arrived at Fayetteville and skirmished with Hampton's cavalry, which covered General Hardee as he withdrew from the town on the bridge spanning Cape Fear river, which he succeeded in burn ing. It was anticipated that General Hardee would contest the possession of this place, but he abandoned it without resist ing and with it a vast amount of public property, including an immense arsenal. At Fayetteville, General Sherman wTas met by the army tug Davidson, Captain Ainsworth commanding, and the gunboat Eolus, Lieutenant-Commander Young, with the first intelligence of the fall of Wilmington, and he then"], [326, "312 AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE. dispatched orders to Generals Schofield and Terry to move upon Goldsboro. The march through South Carolina had left a track of deso lation more than forty miles wide. That state's special guilt in taking the initiative in secession, was assumed by officers and men as the justification of its devastation. As many of the Southern people who were originally opposed to secession, blamed South Carolina for precipitating the movement, and having themselves experienced the terrible retributions of the war which resulted, desired that South Carolina should feel war's heavy hand before peace should come, it was not strange that the national troops in marching through the state which originally suggested secession, and studiously endeavored to induce the Southern States to withdraw from the Union, should leave behind them the fearful evidences of vengeance achieved. But it was easier for the veterans of the war to find justifica tion for sweeping desolation in their own feelings than it is for others to find grounds for its historical vindication. As General Johnston had now lost a large number of im portant places without losing their garrisons, and had been joined by several thousand troops from the West, it was now possible for him to unite all to resist General Sherman between Fayetteville and Goldsboro. Altogether they did not consti tute an army equal to General Sherman's, yet, when united, were formidable against either wing or a smaller fraction. Re ferring to these forces, General Sherman thus wrote : \" These made up an army superior to me in cavalry, and formidable enough in artillery and infantry to justify me in extreme cau tion in making the last step necessary to complete the march I have undertaken.\" In a letter to General Schofield, of March 12th, he said that General Johnston might concentrate at Ra leigh from forty to forty -five thousand men, and wrote:\" I can whip that number with my present force, and with yours and Terry's added, we can go wherever we can live.\" To General Grant, the same day, he wrote : \" Joe Johnston may try to in terpose between me and Schofield about Newbern; but I think he will not try that, but concentrate his scattered armies at Raleigh, and I will go straight at him as soon as I get my men reclothed and our wagons reloaded.\""], [327, "AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE. 313 General Sherman's maneuvers, after leaving Fayetteville, were, in type, a repetition of his former strategy. He moved his cavalry toward Raleigh, and followed immediately with four divisions of the left wing, and more remotely with four of the right, throwing all his trains and the four remaining divisions farther to the east. He commenced these movements on the 15th. At 3 a. m. General Kilpatrick advanced on the direct road to Averysboro to make the feint on Raleigh, and then strike the railroad near Smithfield. General Slocum fol lowed with four unincumbered divisions. General Howard held four divisions in trim to march to General Slocum's help should there be need. The trains of the left wing, with two divisions, moved on the direct road to Goldsboro, and the trains and two divisions of the right wing, toward Faison Station on the Wilmington and Goldsboro railroad. General Sherman ac companied the left wing. The heavy rains made quagmires of the roads, and it became necessary to corduroy them for the artillery. So much of this work had been done in the swamps of South Carolina, that great facility had been attained, and the army moved on with out serious delays. During the evening of the 15th, General Kilpatrick met a strong force of infantry near Taylor's Hole creek, under the command of General Hardee. He skirmished with the rear-guard and captured some prisoners, among whom was Colonel Rhett of the heavy artillery. The next morning General Slocum advanced his infantry columns to the vicinity of Averysboro, and found General Hardee intrenched on a nar row neck of swampy land between the Cape Fear and South rivers. General Hardee's position was in front of the point where the Goldsboro road through Bentonville leaves the main road leading in the direction of Raleigh. This was the first positive resistance which had been offered by infantry in strong force north of Savannah, and was doubtless intended to retard General Sherman's advance, until General Johnston could pre pare for still stronger opposition at some point farther north or east. At this time the conjecture was that he would con centrate at Raleigh, Smithfield, or Goldsboro ; but his point of intended concentration was much nearer than either of these towns. But the execution of General Sherman's plan, wher-"], [328, "314 AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE. ever General Johnston might offer battle, required that Gen eral Hardee should be dislodged. Without this, the feint on Raleigh could not be sustained or even fully initiated, and the ultimate reunion of the columns, as contemplated, could not be effected, as General Hardee barred the diverging road to Goldsboro. General Slocum was therefore ordered to advance against General Hardee, whose position was not strong, except from intrenchments and the softness of the ground before it, which scarcely admitted the deployment and advance of infantry, and rendered the movement of horses almost impossible. Notwithstanding this obstacle, General Slocum advanced, Williams' corps leading and Ward's division deployed. Gen eral Ward's skirmishers soon developed Rhett's brigade of artillery, acting as infantry, behind slight intrenchments, whose trend was at right angles to the road, and was sus tained by a battery, which enfiladed the line of direct ap proach. Direct attack being perilous, General Williams threw a brigade on the left of the enemy's line, when the quondam artillerymen, in complete rout, fell back to a stronger position. This success opened the way for a general attack, to accomplish which Jackson's division formed on the right of Ward and General Davis' two divisions of the Four teenth Corps on his left. General Kilpatrick was directed to reach out beyond Jackson's right flank and grasp the Benton ville road. One brigade of cavalry gained the road, but was attacked furiously by McLaw's division, and driven back. After this repulse, General Slocum's whole line advanced, pushed General Hardee within his intrenchments, and pressed him there so heavily that during the following dark and stormy night he retreated. The next morning, General Ward fol lowed through Averysboro, but soon rejoined the main force, in motion on the Goldsboro road, which the engagement had opened. General Slocum lost about eighty killed and four hundred and eighty wounded. The enemy left one hundred and seventy -eight dead on the field, and lost one hundred and seventy-five men and three guns by capture. The number of his wounded was not ascertained. General Ward's pursuit"], [329, "AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE. 315 developed the fact that General Hardee had retreated toward Smithfield. The night previous, General Kilpatrick crossed South river, and on the 17th advanced toward Elevation, on the east bank. General Slocum built a bridge over the swollen stream, and then advanced on the Goldsboro road. General Sherman con tinued with the left wing, and encamped with the head of column, on the night of the 18th, on the Goldsboro road, twenty-five miles from Goldsboro, and five from Bentonville, at a point where the road from Clinton to Smithfield crosses the one to Goldsboro. General Howard reached Lee's store, a few miles distant, the same night, and the two wings were sufficiently near to give support in battle, and were upon roads which united a short distance to the east. Up to this time, General Sherman had anticipated an attack upon his left flank ; but he was now led to believe that Gen eral Johnston would not attack, as it was supposed that he had retreated to Smithfield, and he gave orders for the two columns to move upon Goldsboro \u2014 General Howard, on the new Goldsboro road, by Falling Creek Church, to give the direct road to General Slocum. His object was to concentrate his forces at Goldsboro as soon as practicable, and he moved to General Howard's head of column, to open communication with Generals Schofield and Terry \u2014 the former coming to meet him from Newbern, and the latter from Wilmington, having conjointly from thirty to thirty-five thousand men. It was not known that General Johnston's whole army was in imme diate proximity, but it was supposed that only cavalry would be met on the way to Goldsboro. Scarcely had General Carlin's division of the Fourteenth Corps, in the advance of the left wing, wheeled into the road to push on to Goldsboro, when Dibbrell's division of cavalry was met, whose stubborn resistance indicated that there was support, or that its courage had given a new type to the con flict of cavalry with infantry. Being under orders to press on, and supposing that cavalry alone was in his front, General Carlin engaged the enemy vigorously, and soon the responsive roar of artillery announced the opening of a battle which General Johnston was delivering, in expectation of crushing"], [330, "316 AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE.. the Fourteenth Corps at least. But the magnitude of the conflict was not yet apparent. As the resistance of the enemy became more stubborn, Colonels Hobart's and Miles' brigades were deployed, the former on the right, and Colonel Buell was sent, by order of General Slocum, some distance to the left to develop the enemy's line. The resistance offered by the en emy was supposed at first to be done by cavalry, and General Slocum so reported to General Sherman, who had gone to the right to join General Howard, whose columns were moving toward Goldsboro. As resistance increased, General Morgan was directed to move to the right of Carlin in support. The former threw General Mitchell's brigade to the right of Miles' brigade and the road, and General Fearing's to the right and rear of Mitchell \u2014 both in double lines. The Seventy-eighth Illinois of the former was sent forward to skirmish. Under this stronger formation, both division generals were directed to press the enemy closely, and compel him to reveal his position and strength. General Slocum soon became convinced that he had before him a force more formidable than a division of cavalry- While still in doubt as to the strength of the enemy, a deserter came to him, who had been a national soldier, who gave in formation that General Johnston had, by forced marches, massed his entire army in his front. This statement being supported by actual developments, induced General Slocum to prepare for defense, and immediately ordered General Wil liams to throw his train to the right, gather his forces, and hasten to the support of General Davis. He then sent a mes senger to General Sherman to announce that there was evi dence that an army was before him. The direction of General Hardee's retreat from Averysboro, had led to the belief that the way to Goldsboro was open. And this was the impression that General Johnston desired to make by all his movements. General Hardee meanwhile had changed direction not far from Averysboro, and by a detour, had united his command with the other forces con centrated and intrenched near Bentonville. Apparently, the coveted conditions of the battle assured the success of General"], [331, "AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE. 317 Johnston's strategy, for two divisions in isolation were within his reach ; two more were distant a few miles, and the four divisions of the right wing, intended for the support of the left, in the event of battle, were in rapid motion toward Golds boro, far to the right. General Williams' defeat, in prospect, was to follow that of General Davis, and the other corps and detached divisions were to be defeated in turn, and the trains destroyed. The plan miscarried, mainly, from two unex pected causes \u2014 the resistance of two divisions until the Twen tieth Corps could give support, and the lack of complete con cert of action in General Johnston's army, composed of the commands of Generals Bragg, Hardee, S. D. Lee, and Cheat ham. When General Slocum first ordered the Twentieth Corps to move quickly to the field, it was his intention to form it on the right of the Fourteenth, but when he became fully con vinced that General Johnston's army was in his front, he di rected General Williams to form his corps, as the several frac tions should reach the field, on the left of General Davis. Robinson's being in the advance, was the first to come up, and was placed in support of Carlin's division. Anticipating that Colonel Buell would need support in his movement, General Carlin was directed by General Davis to move Hobart's brigade to the left, and place Robinson's brigade in its place in the line, and support a battery, located on the main road, which had been responding to the enemy's artillery. Colonel Buell, in advancing as directed, soon struck the enemy's intrenchments, which he assaulted furiously. After a somewhat protracted struggle, resulting in heavy loss, Col onel Buell was forced to withdraw his brigade, which had been badly broken, when the enemy sallied from his works in strong force in pursuit, and pressed him back, until checked by Hobart's brigade, which offered most stubborn resistance. When the action commenced, the small train of the corps, in charge of General Vanderveer's brigade, was moved to the right, until this brigade had reached the right of General Mitchell, where the troops were formed in double lines, with their right resting on a swamp. This was a timely disposi-"], [332, "318 AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE. tion, as the advance of the enemy against Colonel Buell was merely an incident in General Johnston's plan of aggression, which was to wheel his whole line upon its left to envelop and capture General Davis' two divisions. Colonel Hobart, first, after Colonel Buell, felt the force of this general attack, but he was not entirely encompassed, as Buell's attack had broken the continuity of the enemy's movement, and General Johnston's troops on the right of the point assaulted by Buell failed to move forward promptly. This failure gave time for General Davis to make such dispositions as were essential to his safety, and afforded General Slocum opportunity to bring up his reserve artillery and locate it with reference to the arrest of the enemy and the formation of a new line to the left and rear. The front attack upon Hobart and Robinson on his right, was so vigorous as to involve them speedily in the severest conflict, and soon after in retreat upon the artillery, put in position far to the rear, on the main road. The recession of these brigades exposed the artillery on the right of Robinson, three pieces of which were captured, and also caused the re tirement of Miles' brigade between Mitchell's left and the road. There were now only two brigades, Mitchell's and Vanderveer's, on the original line, and the flank of the former was in air. At this juncture, General Davis rode to his right and or dered General Fearing's brigade to move-to the left, forming line of battle as it advanced, and facing the Beutonville road. This brigade moved quickly and was soon lost to view in the thickly wooded swamp. General Morgan now directed Gen eral Mitchell to throw his second line on his left, but this movement had been anticipated by the brigade commander in provision for the stability of his left flank. Mitchell's brig ade was now in single line, bent at right angles in the center. The full weight of the enemy's attack was soon after felt by all the troops on the field. The forces that had driven back Carlin's division and Robinson's brigade, pursued toward the batteries in the rear, and heavy columns assaulted Mitchell and Vanderveer with great impetuosity. General Slocum had been active in forming a new line near his artillery, which"], [333, "AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE. 319 covered the re-formation of the troopsthat had been driven back on the left. To this result General Fearing rendered timely co-operation, as he advanced against the flank of the columns in parallelism to the road, and brought upon himself a counter attack by overwhelming numbers. Wounded himself, and his brigade decimated, he persisted in holding his position for a time, but was finally compelled to give ground, to the expo sure of Mitchell's flank. In the emergency, General Morgan threw Vanderveer's second line to Mitchell's left ; but his line thus extended, was soon overlapped, and the two brigades, in single line, were exposed to attacks in front and rear, as they were cut off from all support and from all communication with the corps commander, and each brigade was separately surrounded. Repulsing the enemy in front repeatedly, they leaped their barricades and reversing the direction of their fire repelled the enemy from their rear. In this state of affairs, General Davis put into the action his escort and a train-guard of four companies under Lieutenant-Colonel Topping. Gen eral Hoke and a part of his division were captured in the rear of Mitchell and Vanderveer, but as a guard could not be spared from the engagement, the prisoners passed round Van derveer's right flank and escaped. In the meantime, the new line had been formed at right an gles to the road, at the batteries, and Fearing's brigade and portions of Carlin's division faced the road, but not in con nection with Mitchell's left. The general line was now bent twice at right angles \u2014 an improvised formation, but the most effective possible for defense ; for the enemy's columns of at tack to the left of Mitchell's salient angle were taken in flank in assaulting either the line parallel to the road or the one at right angles to it, while batteries enfiladed the road between the two angles of the line, and to some extent covered the opening between Mitchell and the troops on his left, and also swept a wide open space to the left of the road. The firmness of Mitchell and Vanderveer contributed largely to break the offensive force of General Johnston's army. Late in the evening, Cogswell's brigade of the First division, Twentieth Corps, moved into the space between Fearing and"], [334, "320 AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE. Mitchell, and drove the enemy back until nearly all the lost ground was recovered. Viewed in relation to the magnitude of the army, success fully resisted by eight brigades of infantry, and Kilpatrick's division of cavalry, which held position on the left and rear, the objects and hopes of the enemy and the character of the fighting by Morgan's division, this engagement takes rank amongst the great decisive battles of the war. The defense, under such unequal conditions, was triumphantly successful, and General Johnston here failed in the only special aggres sive effort against General Sherman in his march from Atlanta to Raleigh. That the issue turned upon the action of the brigades of Mitchell, Vanderveer, and Fearing, can not be doubted. The two former did not give an inch of ground to the enemy, though thrown into single lines, cut off from sup port, surrounded, and compelled to fight in front and rear. The action of Fearing's brigade was not less important, as it disturbed and defeated General Johnston's combination to utilize for complete success his first advantage. General Fear ing fought in complete isolation for some time, without de fenses, and when his right flank was struck by the enemy with such force as to shatter it, he changed front upon his left, ral lied his shattered troops, and held the ground essential to the stability of the new line. The later dispositions and resistance by the whole command gave a symmetry and brilliancy to the conflict which have seldom found expression in such urgent impro vision. To the enemy the issue must have been dispiriting in the extreme. Sadly and hopelessly must the Confederate chief tain have witnessed the failure of his initiative, in destroying General Sherman's corps consecutively, in their isolation. He had constructed his fortifications, which were strong and elab orate, to accomplish this object. His intrenchments crossed the main Goldsboro' road at right angles, then extended to the west one mile, and then curved more than two miles to the west-northwest, nearly parallel to the road, but concealed by distance and forests. He then resisted strongly on the Bentonville road to conceal his fortifications at that point, that he might throw his whole army around the Fourteenth Corps"], [335, "AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE. 321 and interpose between it and the Twentieth, which, at the first, was nearly ten miles in the rear, and restrained from swift motion by exceedingly boggy roads, made almost im passable by the wagons and artillery of the Fourteenth Corps. The failure of the initiative of this elaborate plan, was there fore entirely unexpected to General Johnston, and was doubt less as much a surprise to himself as was the presence of his army at Bentonville to General Sherman, who scattered his columns the morning before the battle, believing that the Con federate army was far to the north, having abandoned the purpose of offering further resistance to his advance to Golds boro. ' In the evening the remainder of the Twentieth Corps reached the field, and was placed on the left of the line of bat tle, with Kilpatrick's troopers covering that flank. When General Sherman was informed by General Slocum, through a messenger late in the day, that General Johnston's army had been developed, he directed him to call up his two divisions guarding the wagon trains, and also General Hazen's division of the Fifteenth Corps, then in the rear of the right wing, but several miles distant, and to act defensively until he could direct the remaining divisions of the right wing to the enemy's left and rear, from the direction of Cox's bridge over the Neuse river. At the time, General Howard's advance was near this bridge, about ten miles from Goldsboro. Gen eral Sherman did not give full credit to General Slocum's re ports of General Johnston's concentration at Bentonville, as he did not believe that he would accept or invite battle with the Neuse river in his rear. On the morning of the 20th, Generals Baird and Geary, each with two brigades, and General Hazen, with his entire division, arrived on the field. General Hazen, by direction of General Slocum, formed his command on the right of General Morgan, and General Baird moved out in front of the line of battle of the preceding day. These three generals received orders to press the enemy, and General Morgan gained a por tion of his line on the right. At 2 a. m., on the 20th, General Sherman informed General VOL. II \u2014 21"], [336, "322 AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE. Slocum that he would go to his support with his whole army. He turned back the right wung from the Neuse river, ordered General Schofield to push for Goldsboro and then move toward Smithfield, and instructed General Terry to move on Cox's bridge an* establish a crossing. By daylight, General Howard's columns were in motion toward Bentonville. Cav alry was encountered earlier, but the first infantry was found behind barricades near Bentonville, three miles east of the battle-field. General Logan, in moving forward, ascertained that General Johnston's left was refused behind a parapet, connecting with the intrenchments before General Slocum, with a salient on the main Goldsboro road between the two wings. His flanks rested on Mill creek, covering the road to Smithfield, which crosses the stream on a bridge. General Sherman directed General Howard to approach cautiously, who connected his left flank with General Slocum's right at 4 p. M., and then a strong line was presented to the enemy. On the 21st, General Sherman gave orders to press the enemy with skirmishers, use artillery freely, but not give battle unless at an advantage. The same day, General Schofield reached Goldsboro, and General Terry laid a pon toon bridge at Cox's bridge, and then the three armies, in the aggregate nearly one hundred thousand men, were virtually united. During the day, General Mower's division of the Seven teenth Corps worked round the enemy's left flank, and nearly reached the bridge so essential to General Johnston. This movement and the approach of Generals Schofield and Terry induced General Johnston to abandon his position the follow ing night. General Johnston, in this case as in all others dur ing the war, made a safe retreat. He sacrificed his pickets and left his wounded in hospitals, but lost nothing of value besides. General Slocum lost nine officers and one hundred and forty-five men killed, fifty-one officers and eight hundred and sixteen men wounded, and two hundred and twenty-three captured. The aggregate loss was twelve hundred and forty seven. He buried on the field one hundred and sixty-seven of the enemy, and captured three hundred and thirty prisoners."], [337, "323 AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE. General Howard's total loss was three hundred and ninety nine, and he captured twelve hundred and eighty-seven.* General Johnston was pursued at dawn the next morning, but the troops were soon recalled, when General Sherman renewed his orders for the concentration at Goldsboro. After the armies had been placed in encampments, General Sherman visited General Grant to confer with regard to the final operations of the war on the Atlantic coast. He returned with the impression that General Lee would unite with Gen eral Johnston after abandoning Richmond. But whatever the specific action of the two Confederate generals might be, he was to co-operate with General Grant by advancing against General Johnston and then moving north. At Goldsboro, General Sherman proposed a new organiza tion for his combined armies, giving General Schofield the command of the \" center,\" and thus designating his forces, retaining for the right wing its old designation, Army of the Tennessee, and styling the two corps of the Army of the Cumberland, the Fourteenth and Twentieth, the \" Army of Georgia.\" The left wing had informally borne this name during the march through Georgia and the Carolinas, but these corps were only really detached from the Army of the Cumberland after they had fought their last battle. This fact gives the Fourth, Fourteenth, and Twentieth Corps a community of fame and glory achieved at Nashville and Bentonville. General Sherman had assigned them separate fields of operation, but had not formally separated them until it was too late to give them new historic relations. The fame of \" Bentonville,\" quite as much as that of \" Franklin \" and \"Nashville,\" belongs to the Army of the Cumberland. At Bentonville, the Fourteenth Corps, long under the personal command of General Thomas, and the Twentieth, of more re cent connection with the Army of the Cumberland, but of friendly alliance, achieved a great victory. Indeed, all the achievements of these three corps, in union or separation, are portions of the history of the same army, as by hearty consent each has an interest in the aggregate glory. They have an '* General Sherman's statement in official report."], [338, "324 AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE. undivided tenure in the fame of the army, achieved in all the battles from Lookout Mountain to Jonesboro ; not less do they hold in common the glory of the fields so widely separated. The shouts of the Fourteenth and Twentieth Corps at Savan nah for victory at Nashville, in which the Fourth and their own representatives had a share, and their beloved commander the chief glory, was answered in glad response from every camp in Tennessee and Alabama for the repulse of General Johnston in his attempt to bring defeat and disgrace to the oldest corps of the unequaled Army of the Cumberland. On the 9th of April, General Lee surrendered himself and his army to General Grant, and on the following morning, Gen eral Sherman's armies moved from the vicinity of Goldsboro toward Smithfield and Raleigh, against the only remaining Confederate army east of the Mississippi river. General John ston knew well that he could not resist the hundred thousand men moving against him, but to make the most of his slender possibilities, he retreated through Raleigh as General Sherman advanced, and fell back to Greensboro. His objects were to avoid the crime of waging a hopeless warfare, to get the best possible terms in a surrender which would terminate it, and disband his troops on such conditions as would prevent their plundering their friends as they sought their homes. The last campaigns had inflicted upon the South losses of a magnitude transcending approximate estimation and a desolated country, wasted resources and the traditions of a lost cause (but a cause which, during the bloody trial of its existence and supremacy, had commanded the persistent efforts and strongest aspirations of millions) were now the sad inheritance of a proud people. And General Johnston sought to save what material resources remained, and to return his soldiers to their homes with as little demoralization as possible. At Smithfield, General Sherman heard of the surrender of General Lee, and pressed forward with the conviction that he would soon give the final blow. At Raleigh, he dropped his trains, and directed General Howard to follow the line of re treat, and General Slocum to take a route to the south through Pittsville and Ashboro, in expectation that General Johnston would follow the railroad to Salisbury. On the 14th, he re-"], [339, "AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE. 325 ceived a note which opened negotiations and resulted in a con vention embracing conditions of peace as well as the surrender of the remaining Confederate forces and armies, and declaring a truce until after notice should be given of its discontinuance, on account of the disapproval of the government of the terms agreed upon. The government did disapprove, and the stipu lated notice of forty-eight hours, as the limit of the truce, was given on the 24th. Two days later, there was a second con ference at General Johnston's request, which \u2022 resulted in the surrender of all the forces of the Confederacy east of the Chat tahoochee river. The next clay General Sherman announced in orders the cessation of hostilities, and made provision for the relief of the people. He then directed Generals Howard and Slocum to move their armies through Richmond to Washington. Headquarters Military Division or the Mississippi, In the Field, Fayetteville, N. C, March 12, 1865. General : \u2014 We must not lose time for Joe Johnston to concentrate at Goldsboro. We can not prevent his concentrating at Raleigh, but he have no rest. I want General Schofield to go on with his railroad from Newbern as fast as he can, and you do the same from Wilmington. If we can get the roads to, and secure Goldsboro by April 10th, it will be soon enough, but every day is worth a million of dollars. I can whip Joe Johnston, provided he don't catch one of my corps in flank ; and I will see that my army marches hence to Goldsboro in compact form. W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.

Joe Johnston may try to interpose between me here and Schofield about Newbern ; but I think he will not try that, but concentrate his scat tered armies at Raleigh, and I will go straight at him as soon as I get my men reclothed and our wagons reloaded. Keep everybody busy and let Stoneman push toward Greensboro or Charlotte from Knoxville ; even a feint in that quarter will be most im portant. . . .

General : \u2014 I am now across Cape Fear river, and to-morrow will draw out ten miles, and next day, if weather is favorable, will begin to mar neuver on Goldsboro. I shall feign on Raleigh, by approaching, and it maybe striking the railroad half-way between Goldsboro and Raleigh; then, as soon as the wagons are well toward Faison's, will swing rapidly in front of Goldsboro, but will not cross the Neuse till I hear from you. You must push vigorously toward Kingston and Goldsboro, with the ab solute certainty that I will engage the attention of Joe Johnston's army to the west and southwest of Goldsboro. . . I take it for granted Joe Johnston now has S. D. Lee's corps, four thousand (4,000); Cheatham's, five thousand (5,000); Hoke's, eight thou sand (8,000) ; Hardee's, ten thousand (10,000) ; and detachments, about ten thousand (10,000) ; making thirty-seven thousand (37,000), with near eight thousand (8.000) cavalry. ' Our duty is to effect a junction south of the Neuse ; but if you can get Kingston whilst Joe Johnston is engaged with me, do so, and push on toward Goldsboro. I will attack the Raleigh road. . . .

Dear General : \u2014 I am now across Cape Fear river with nearly all my army, save one division, with orders to cross at daylight to-morrow. I shall then draw out ten miles, and begin my maneuvers for the possession of Goldsboro, which is all important for our future purposes."], [341, "AVERYSBORO AND BENTONVILLE. 327 I was in hopes that 1 could get some shoes and stockings at Wilming ton, but the tug Davidson has returned with Brigadier-General Dodge, chief quartermaster, with word that there is no clothing there; but he brings us some forage, sugar, and coffee. I can get along for ten days, having forced the army to collect plenty of beef and a good deal of corn meal. I shall to-night move my cavalry (5,000) straight toward Raleigh, and follow it with four divisions infantry, without trains, and keep the trains off toward the right rear. I will hold another four divisions in close sup port, and move toward Smithfield, or to strike the railroad half way be tween Goldsboro and Raleigh ; then, when my trains are well across toward the Neuse, will move rapidly to Bentonville, and afterward, at leisure, move opposite Goldsboro, and open direct communication with \u25a0General Schofield, who is ordered to push against Kingston and Golds boro. I may cross the Neuse about Cox's bridge, and move into Goldsboro ; but will not attempt it till within close communication with General Schofield. I have sent full orders to Schofield. It will not do to build any determinate plan until I am in full possession of Goldsboro. I have ordered Generals Schofield and Terry to push toward Goldsboro as hard as possible from the east, as I advance from the southwest. The enemy is superior to me in cavalry, but I can beat his infantry man for man; and I do n't think that he can bring forty thousand (40,000) men for battle. I will force him to guard Raleigh until I have interposed between it and Goldsboro. Weather is good now, but threatens rain. We are all well. Keep all parts busy, and I will give the enemy no rest.

General : \u2014 I have notified General Howard that to-morrow night your head of column will be near the cross-roads above Kyle's landing; the next day across Black river, near Mingo, and third day near Bentonville ; and have instructed him to have four (4) divisions in easy support, and a little in advance of you \u2014 say, five or six miles \u2014 so that, on receiving orders or hearing battle, he may come promptly up on your right. I think Colonel Garber can promise you another boat, in which case it would be well to send to Wilmington your prisoners of war You might leave them to-morrow where the gunboat lies, two (2) miles below Gen eral Howard's bridge, and the guard, if unable to overtake you the day after to-morrow, could follow direct to Bentonville.

I am, truly yours, W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General Commanding. Major-General Slocum, Commanding Left Wing. Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, [n the Field, opposite Fayetteville, March 14, 1865 \u2014 7 P. M. General : \u2014 I think I have studied the problem of the next move, and will give you in confidence its analysis. We must make a strong feint on Raleigh, and strike with cavalry, if possible, the railroad near Smithfield. I take it for granted that the bridge will be too strongly guarded for General Kilpatrick to surprise, and therefore I will leave him to disable that road, of course only par tially, between the Neuse and Eureka. To this end the cavalry will move to-night across the bridge, beginning at 3 a. m., and will push up the plank-road to about Averysboro, General Slocum following up with four disincumbered divisions to near the forks of the road, moving hi3 trains by a cross-road toward Bentonville. The next move will be the cavalry to Elevation, and General Slocum will cross Black river. The next move will bring General Slocum to Bentonville, and Kilpatrick, sup ported by a division of infantry, will make a dash for the railroad. This is as far as I will now determine. I want you to be as near in support as possible. I do think it is John ston's only chance to meet this army before an easyjunction can be effected with General Schofield. I would like you to have four (4) divisions free to move rapidly to the sound of battle in the direction of Mingo creek and Elevation, and, at any event, to make a junction by head of column with General Slocum at Bentonville. The weather looks bad, and I fear we may have swamps about South river. I think it would be well for you to have four divisions to get ahead of General Slocum's trains on the direct road from Fayette ville to Bentonville, and keeping ahead of him about five or six miles, so as, in case of action, to come up on his right.

General Slocum will feel out toward Averysboro, but move his column on the Goldsboro road, which is that which crosses Black and Mingo creeks, just ahead of where we are. Our true tactics would be to push all our columns to Smithfield, but I will only follow Hardee far enough to give himimpulse, when we must resume our course. I want you to-day to get to where the Goldsboro road crosses Mingo, and have that bridge well repaired. You need not come on to General Slocum unless you hear him engaged. We might cut his column at Ele vation, but it will be enough to think of that to-night. General Blair is getting too far off; better draw him and all your trains toward Troublefield's Store.

Try and keep around the head of Falling Water creek, viz., to the south. I will push General Slocum to-morrow and next day, and think by day after to-morrow we will be in position \u2014 viz., you directly in front of Goldsboro, and General Slocum at Cox's bridge. At the time I sont Colonel Ewing to you yesterday, the enemy had brought General Slocum up all standing, and it was on the theory that he would hold General Slocum there, that I wanted you at Mingo bridge. But the enemy retreated in the night on Smithfield, and we are again on the march, feigning to the left, but moving trains and troops as rapidly as the roads admit on Goldsboro. You may do the same.

It started from Averysboro and North river, with General Kilpat rick to the north of the road. We heard some musketry and artillery in that direction, but Colonel Poe left Mingo creek, which he bridged, at 11 A. M., at which time the Twentieth Corps was a half mile behind. We can not get any farther to-day. General Davis may go a couple of miles farther to the forks of the road. I think this road, the Averysboro and Goldsboro road, will lead to Cox's bridge, though it is represented as passing three (3) miles south of Bentonville. Get on the right-hand road, so that General Geary and his trains may take that to Goldsboro, via Cox's bridge. I think the enemy is concentrated about Smithfield, and I can not make out whether Goldsboro is held in force or not. I think it probable that Joe Johnston will try to prevent our getting to Goldsboro. I fear General Slocum will be jammed with all his trains in a narrow space ; but, at the same time, I do n't want to push you too far till his flank is better covered by the Neuse. General Slocum is back with the Twentieth Corps, and as soon as I hear from him I will send over to you.

He re ports Hardee retreating on Smithfield, and Joe Johnston collecting his old Georgia army this side of Raleigh. I know he will call in all minor posts, which embraces Goldsboro. You may therefore move straight for Goldsboro, leaving General Slocum the river road, and, if possible, the one from Lee's Store toward Falling Waters. Make a break into Golds boro, from the south, and let your scouts strike out for General Schofield, at Kingston, though I hope to moet him at Goldsboro. Our roads are very bad, but I think the Fourteenth Corps will be at Cox's bridge to-morrow night, and will aim to strike the railroad to the northwest of Goldsboro.

To-morrow we will cross the Neuse river at Cox's bridge, and be near Goldsboro, to prevent the enemy from occupying Goldsboro in force. The scout Pike has arrived with dispatch of 17th. Continue to extend to the right as fast as possible, and I expect you to move toward Golds boro, even if it be unnecessary, as I do n't want to lose men in direct attack, when it can be avoided. . . . We whipped Hardee easily about Averysboro. All retreated on Smith field and Raleigh. W. T. SHERMAN, Major- General. Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, Falling Creek Church, March 19, 1865 \u2014 2 p. m.* General: \u2014 General Howard, with one division, is now at this point, which is just three miles south from Cox's bridge and ten from Goldsboro. A scout is just in from General Schofield, who writes that he will leave Kingston for Goldsboro to-day or to-morrow. I have sent him a courier with orders to march straight for Goldsboro. General Howard's four (4) divisions are strung out, but he will push them through to-night. We occupy a position dangerous to the enemy, if he thinks he is in front of the whole army. You may strengthen your position, but feel the en emy all night. If he is there at daylight we will move to Cox's bridge, and then turn toward you. I think you will find him gone in the morn ing. General Howard has sent a regiment to Cox's bridge. It has not reported yet. He has the bridge across Falling Creek, two miles east of this, toward Goldsboro, and has some mounted men opposite Goldsboro, where they find a tete-de-pont occupied by the enemy. General Blair is about five miles south of this with his trains. I will order General Kilpatrick to remain with you. Get up your trains between Lee's Store and your camp, and keep the enemy busy until we can get up the Fourth division of the Fifteenth Corps. If you hear firing to your front, not explained by your own acts, you must assault or turn the enemy, for it will not do to let him fight us sep arately. Yours, W. T. SHERMAN, Major- General. Major-General Slocum, Commanding Left Wing. *The date of this dispatch is thus given in the '* Report of the Committee on the Conduct of the War,\" Supplement, Part I., Second Session, Thirty-eighth Congress, page 358.

Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, In the Field, Cox's Bridge, Neuse River, N. C, March 22, 1865. General : \u2014 We resumed the march toward Goldsboro. I was with the left wing until I supposed all danger passed; but when General Slocum's head of column was within four miles of Bentonville, after skirmishing as usual with cavalry, he became aware that there was infantry at his front. He deployed a couple of brigades, which, on advancing, sustained a partial repulse, but soon rallied, and he formed a line of the two leading divis ions, Morgan's and Carlin's, of Jeff. C. Davis' corps. The enemy at tacked these divisions with violence, but was repulsed. This was in the forenoon of Sunday, the 19th. General Slocum brought forward the two divisions of the Twentieth Corps, and hastily disposed them for defense and General Kilpatrick moved his cavalry on the left. General Joe Johnston had, the night before, marched his whole army \u2014 \u25a0 Bragg, Cheatham, S. D. Lee, Hardee, and all the troops he had from every quarter \u2014 determined, as he told his men, to crush one of our corps, and then defeat us in detail. He attacked General Slocum in position from 3 p. m. on the 1 9th till dark, but was everywhere repulsed, and lost fearfully. At the time, I was with the Fifteenth Corps, marching on a road more to the right; but on hearing of General Slocum's danger, directed that corps to ward Cox's bridge, and that night brought Blair's corps over, and on the 20th marched rapidly on Johnston's flank and rear. We struck him about noon, and forced him to assume the defensive, and fortify. Yester day we pushed him hard, and came very near crushing him. W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General. Lieutenant-General U. S.

Dear General: \u2014 I can hardly help smiling when I contemplate my command. It is decidedly mixed. I believe, but am not certain, that you are in my jurisdiction, but I certainly can not help you in the way of orders or men, nor do I think you need either. General Crust has just arrived with his provisional division, which will at once be broken up, and the men sent to their proper regiments, as that of Meagher was on my arrival. You may have some feeling about my asking that General Slocum should have command of the two corps that properly belonged to you \u2014 viz., Fourteenth and Twentieth; but you can recall that he was but a corps commander, and could not legally make orders of discharge, transfer, etc., which was imperatively necessary. I therefore asked that General Slocum be assigned to command \" an army in the field,\" called the \"Army of Georgia,\" composed of the Fourteenth and Twentieth Corps. The order is not yet made by the President, though I have recognized it, because both General Grant and the President sanctioned it, and prom ised to have the order made. . . . W. T.

In terminating the pursuit of General Hood's army, Gen eral Thomas' first thought was to put his forces in winter can tonments to rest after their severe service since early spring, a\"nd to prepare for such operations as the future movements of the enemy might render necessary, or such as might promise the entire supremacy of the national government within the limits of the Military Division of the Mississippi or throughout the Southern States ; but General Grant ordered otherwise, and on the 31st of December the troops of the military division were disposed with a view to immediate active operations. Gen eral A. J. Smith's corps, and four divisions of cavalry under General Wilson, were ordered to Eastport, Mississippi, and the Fourth Corps to take post at Huntsville, Alabama, according to previous arrangement, for a different purpose, and the Twenty third Corps was left at Columbia, instead of taking position at Dalton, Georgia. General Sherman was desirous that General Thomas should conduct a campaign in Northern Alabama and Georgia, and expressed this wish to General Grant; but the latter had formed other plans before this wish had been expressed, and had ordered General Schofield's corps, and the detachments from the corps with General Sherman, to North Carolina, to co-operate with him. Subsequently, he directed General Thomas to send General A. J. Smith's forces and five thousand cavalry, by river, to report to Major-General Canby, at ISTew Orleans, to take part in the operations against Mobile. Ac cordingly, General Smith's troops started from Eastport on the"], [352, "338 STONEMAN'S CAVALRY OPERATIONS. 6th of February, and General Knipe's division of cavalry from Eastport and Nashville on the 12th. These transfers of forces reduced the troops under General Thomas to the Fourth Corps, the infantry and artillery garrisons of the military division, the cavalry divisions under General Wilson, and the one under General Stoneman in East Tennessee. Early in February, General Thomas ascertained from various sources that a remnant of General Hood's army, under Gen erals Cheatham and S. D. Lee, were on their way from Mis sissippi to South Carolina, moving through Selma and Mont gomery, Alabama, to reinforce the army opposing General Sherman, and that other fragments of the Confederate Army of the Tennessee \u2014 a skeleton corps \u2014 under General Richard Taylor, and seven thousand cavalry, under General Forrest, remained in Mississippi, with headquarters at Meridian. February 6th, General Grant directed that General Stone man should be sent on an expedition to penetrate North Car olina and well down toward Columbia, South Carolina, to destroy the enemy's railroads and military resources which were out of the reach of General Sherman ; and on the 13th, General Grant directed General Thomas to prepare a cavalry expedition to penetrate Northern Alabama and co-operate with General Canby in his movement against Mobile. Prepa rations for both expeditions were completed about the same time, and on the 22d of March Generals Stoneman and Wil son moved as respectively directed. The cavalry division in East Tennessee, commanded by Brigadier- General A. C. Gillem, comprised three brigades, under the respective command of Colonel Palmer, Brigadier-General Brown, and Colonel Miller. It was concentrated at Mossy creek on the 22d of March, in readiness for movement into North Carolina under the personal direction of General Stoneman. It was known at this time that General Sherman had captured Columbia, South Carolina, and was moving into North Caro lina. Rumors were current that General Lee's army would evacuate Richmond and Petersburg, and might force a pas sage through Lynchburg to Knoxville. To guard against such a contingency, General Stoneman was directed to move toward Lynchburg, to destroy the railroad and resources of"], [353, "STONEMAN'S CAVALRY OPERATIONS. 339 that region, and then sweep through Western North Carolina with the same destructive intent ; and the Fourth Corps was ordered by General Thomas to advance from Huntsville as far into East Tennessee as it could supply itself, to repair the railroad as it advanced, and form at last with General Tillson's division of infantry, a strong support to General Stoneman, should he meet the enemy in such force as to drive him back. On the 24th, General Stoneman moved to Morristown, and there detached the Third brigade, Colonel Miller commanding, to make a detour from Bull's Gap, to reach the railroad between Jonesboro and Carter's Station, in the rear of a force reported to be in the vicinity of the former place. The other two bri gades advanced directly forward, and encamped on the night of the 25th ten miles west of Jonesboro. Here all incum brances were left, save one ambulance, one wagon, and four guns with their caissons. At noon on the 26th, the division was reunited at Jones- boro. Colonel Miller had complied with his instructions, but the Confederate general, Jackson, had fled in haste the night previous. General Stoneman then moved forward, and reached the Watauga river on the 27th, and the town of Boone, North Carolina, on the 28th. At the latter place, Major Keogh, of General Stoneman's staff, with a detachment of the Twelfth Kentucky, routed a company of home guards, capturing sixty. Here the brigades again separated \u2014 General Stoneman, with Palmer's brigade, moving on Wilkesboro, by Deep Gap, and General Gillem, with the other two brigades and the ar- tillery, to the same point, by the Flat Gap road. From Wilkes- boro, the whole command moved through Mount Airy, and over the Blue Ridge, to Hillsville, Virginia, with no incidents, save the capture of a small forage train. At Hillsville, Col- onel Miller, with five hundred picked men, moved on Wythe- ville, destroyed a depot of supplies there, and a bridge over Reedy creek, and another at Max Meadows. The command then advanced to Jacksonville, where Major Wagner, of the Fifteenth Tennessee, with two hundred and fifty select men, dashed on to Salem, Virginia, and destroyed bridges and the railroad track extensively. On the 6th of April, two brigades \u2022were at Christianburg, and had possession of ninety miles of"], [354, "340 STONEMAN'S CAVALRY OPERATIONS. the Virginia and Tennessee railroad, from Wytheville to Sa lem. From Christianburg, after destroying twenty miles of railroad, and several bridges over Roanoke river, and disabling the bridge over New river, Colonel Palmer moved to Martins ville, and General Brown to Taylorsville, and at 10 A. M. on the 8th, Palmer and Brown united at that place, and then the whole command converged upon Danbury, North Carolina, arriving there on the 9th. At Germantown, beyond, Colonel Palmer was detached, and ordered to Salem, North Carolina, to destroy the large factories, which were supplying the Con federate armies with clothing, and then to send parties to destroy the railroad south of Greensboro, and between that place and Danville, the main column turned south from Ger mantown toward Salisbury, bivouacking at night on the 11th, twelve miles north of Salisbury. A little after midnight, the South Yadkin river was crossed, without opposition, as had not been expected. From the river, the main force advanced on a new road on the left, while a battalion of the Twelfth Kentucky was sent on the road to the right, to demonstrate strongly at the crossing of Grant creek, and, if successful in passing that stream, to attack in rear the forces defending the upper bridge. At daylight, the head of the main column met the enemy's pickets, who were driven back to the bridge over Grant creek, and his artillery and musketry opened from the other side. A reconnoissance developed the fact that a portion of the floor of the bridge had been taken up from two spans of the bridge, and trains could be heard leaving the town on the South Carolina and Morgantown railroads. General Gillem now ordered Colonel Miller and General Brown to close up their brigades, and a section of Reagan's battery to move forward. At this juncture, Gen eral Stoneman directed that a detachment should cross the creek two and a half miles above, cut the railroad, and, if practicable, capture the train, and then get in the rear of the town, and annoy the enemy as much as possible. Lieutenant- Colonel Slater, of the Eleventh Kentucky, was designated with his regiment for this service, and Captain Morrow, of General Stoneman's staff, joined the detachment. At the same time, Major Donnelly, of the Thirteenth Tennessee, with one bun-"], [355, "STONEMAN'S CAVALRY OPERATIONS. 341 dred men, and Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, with a party of dismounted men, were ordered to cross at lower points. As soon as these parties engaged the enemy across the stream, and the rattling fire of the Spencer rifles of the Eleventh Ken- tucky announced that the enemy's left had been turned, Col- onel Miller's brigade was ordered to advance on the main road. A detachment of the Eighth and Thirteenth Tennessee regiments restored the floor of the bridge, and Miller charged across. By this time the enemy was falling back along his entire line. Brown was thrown forward to support Miller, who continued to press the enemy back. The retreat soon terminated in rout. Major Keogh, who had led the charge of the Eleventh Kentucky on the right, having been joined by Major Sawyer's battalion of the Eighth Tennessee, charged the enemy again at the intersection of the Statesville road with the one upon which Colonel Miller was advancing, and captured all the artillery which had been used on the enemy's left flank. The pursuit was continued until the enemy's Droops lost even the semblance of organization, and all who escaped capture, hid themselves in the woods. Three thousand men, under command of Major-General W. M. Gardener, with eighteen pieces of artillery, in charge of Colonel J. C. Pem- berton, recently a lieutenant-general, were thus routed. Nearly thirteen hundred prisoners were captured, eighteen pieces of artillery, and public property of immense value, most of which was destroyed. At 2 p. m. Major Barnes, to whom the destruction of public property had been committed, reported having destroyed ten thousand stand of small arms, one million pounds of (small) ammunition, ten thousand pounds of artillery ammunition, six thousand pounds of powder, three magazines, six depots, ten thousand bushels of corn, seventy-five thousand suits of uniform clothing, two hundred and fifty thousand blankets (English manufacture), twenty thousand pounds of leather, six thousand pounds of bacon, one hundred thousand pounds of salt, twenty-seven thousand pounds of rice, ten thousand pounds of saltpetre, fifty thousand bushels of wheat, eighty barrels of turpentine, fifteen million of Confederate money, and medical stores worth over one hundred thousand dollars in gold. Besides"], [356, "342 STONEMAN'S CAVALRY OPERATIONS. the detachments which had been sent to Virginia, destroyed the railroad nearly to Lynchburg, seven thousand bales of cotton and two large factories, and captured four hundred prisoners. The railroad south of Salisbury having been de stroyed for some distance, and it having been determined to send the prisoners, and captured artillery, not destroyed, to East Tennessee, the forces withdrew on the 13th, and reached Lenoir on the 15th. Here General Stoneman turned over the command to Gen eral Gillem, with instructions as to the disposition and service of the troops. Colonel Palmer was to take post at Lincoln ton, and scout down the Catawba ; General Brown, at Morgan town, to connect with Colonel Palmer on the Catawba, and Colonel Miller, at Asheville, to open communications through to Greenville, Tennessee. The objects in leaving the cavalry on this side of the mountains, were to obstruct, intercept, or disperse any troops moving south, and to capture trains. When General Gillem, with Brown's and Miller's brigades, reached the Catawba, two and a half miles from Morgantown, he found the bridge torn up, the ford blockaded, and his pass age of the stream disputed by Major-General McCown, with about three hundred men and one piece of artillery. He then sent Major Kenner, of the Eighth Tennessee, to cross up the river and reach the enemy's rear, and threw forward another battalion of the same regiment as directly toward the bridge as shelter could be found. Opening with his artillery, he disabled the enemy's gun and drove him from his defenses, and the dismounted men charging over the sleepers of the bridge, drove him from the ford, and captured his gun and fifty men. On the 19th, General Gillem moved toward Asheville, byway of Swananoa Gap. He found the gap the nex day, to be held by about five hundred men, with four pieces of artillery. Leaving Colonel Miller to make feints, he moved rapidly to Rutherford forty miles distant, and at sundown on the 22d, he passed the Blue Ridge, at Hammond's Gap, and was in the rear of the en emy, who retreated through Andersonville, pursued by Slater, who, in a charge, captured the four guns and seventy men At this time he learned that Colonel Palmer had not moved as he had been ordered, in consequence of information through"], [357, "stoneman's cavalry operations. 343 General Echols, that a truce had been proclaimed. Deeming it essential to the safety of his command that he should hold one of the gaps of the Blue Ridge, General Gillem ordered Palmer to move as previously directed, and advanced with his own column to attack Asheville. At 3 p. m. on the 23d, he re ceived a flag of truce from Asheville, covering a communication from General Martin, which stated that he had received official notification of a truce. Later, General Martin proposed a meet ing for the next clay. That night at 11 o'clock, the fact of the existence of a truce was established by an official announce ment, coming from General Sherman, and at 11 p. m. he received an order from him, directed to General Stoneman, requiring the command to move to Durham Station or Hillsboro. Being convinced that this order had been issued by General Sherman, under the conviction that this cavalry division was at or near Salisbury, he decided to draw back to his base at Greenville, Tennessee, rather than advance two hundred miles to Durham's 'Station. At the meeting with General Martin, he announced this decision, and requested three days' rations for his men, to save the people on his route from supplying his wants by con straint. General Martin furnished supplies, but demanded the rendition of the artillery which had been captured the day be fore ; but General Gillem positively refused to do this, as the capture had been made prior to his reception of any authentic announcement of a truce. This expedition was ably conducted and eminently success ful. General Stoneman's strategy put the enemy under positive disadvantage, at each objective, in receiving the intended blow. When the Blue Ridge was first passed, the enemy supposed that Salisbury was menaced. This supposition placed the Ten nessee and Virginia railroad at General Stoneman's mercy, and the advance for its destruction was a surprise, and cost the enemy three trains, and the loss of more than two hundred wagons, and twenty-one pieces of artillery, spiked and abandoned, while the troops that were separated from the main body by this move ment, returned to Kentucky. Again, when the column turned south, Colonel Palmer's divergence toward Danville and Greens boro, by Martinsville, caused the enemy to withdraw troops from Salisbury ,which fell more easily in consequence when it was"], [358, "344 stoneman's cavalry operations. attacked, as the paramount object of the advance southward. The enemy discovered his mistake, and made effort to reinforce Salisbury when the danger was apparent, but the railroad being cut in five places south of Danville, the effort miscarried, as the reinforcing division of infantry and brigade of cavalry did not reach the vicinity of the town until after the destruction of the depots, magazines, and stores. And at last a brigade held the enemy at Swananoa Gap, until another passed to the rear and surprised and captured a large portion of his force. The captures were twenty -five guns taken in action, twenty one abandoned in Southwest Virginia, and over six thousand prisoners and seventeen battle-flags. Washington, December 31, 1864 \u2014 11.30 a. m. Major-General Thomas: Lieutenant-General U. S. Grant directs all of your available force not es sential to hold your communications, be collected on the Tennessee river \u2014 say, at Eastport and Tuscumbia \u2014 and be made ready for such move ments as may be ordered. It is supposed that a portion of the troops in Louisville, and other parts of Kentucky and Tennessee, can now be avail able for active operations elsewhere. They should be made ready for that purpose. General Dodge wishes you to return to St. Louis the Thirty-ninth Missouri Infantry, now at Louisville, so that he may com plete its organization. Please give us the earliest possible notice of Hood's line of retreat, so that orders may be given for the continuance of the campaign.

EXTRACT FROM GENERAL THOMAS' REPORT. On the 6th of February, a communication was received from Lieuten ant-General Grant, directing an expedition, commanded by General Stone man, to be sent from East Tennessee to penetrate North Carolina and well down toward Columbia, South Carolina, to destroy the enemy's rail roads and military resources in that section, and visit a portion of the state beyond the control or reach of General Sherman's column. As the movement was to be merely for the purpose of destruction, directions were given General Stoneman to evade any heavy engagements with the enemy's forces."], [359, "stoneman's cavalry operations. 345 Again, on the 13th of February, General Grant telegraphed me to pre pare a cavalry expedition of about ten thousand strong, to penetrate Northern Alabama, acting as a co-operative force to the movement on Mobile by General Canby. Before leaving Eastport, Mississippi, I had directed General Wilson to get his command in readiness for just such a campaign, of which the above was simply an outline \u2014 my instructions being for him to move on Selma, Montgomery, and Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and to capture those places if possible, after accomplishing which he was to operate against any of the enemy's forces in the direction of Missis sippi, Mobile, or Macon, as circumstances might demand.

General Stoneman has not yet started, but informed my chief of staff a few days since at Louisville, that he would be ready to start about the 1st of March. I will notify you as soon as he gets off. He has been delayed for want of horses. I have just returned from Eastport, having completed the ar rangements for the cavalry expedition from that point. Owing to the recent stormy and rainy weather, General Wilson will be delayed a few days for the roads to dry up. He will be able to start in a few days with at least ten thousand men. GEO. H. THOMAS, Major-General U. S. A. Commanding."], [361, "347 CHAPTER XL. GENERAL J. H. WILSON'S CAVALRY OPERATIONS IN ALABAMA AND GEORGIA. General Wilson's column of cavalry, comprising Generals McCook's, Long's, and Upton's divisions, having crossed the Tennessee river on the 18th of March, was put in motion southward on the 23d. General Hatch's division not having a full remoirnt, was deprived of all horses for the other divis- ions, and left at Eastport, to join the column subsequently, should horses be obtained in time. General Wilson's wagon and pontoon trains, including about two hundred and fifty teams, were put under the direction of Captain Brown, pro- tected by fifteen hundred dismounted men, under Major Archer. The destitution of forage, in the region immedi- ately south of the Tennessee river, imposed the necessity of starting the troops in detachments to glean over a broad belt of country, what little produce might be left, where war had so long and so heavily laid its hand. This diffusion, however, involved no hazard, as General Forrest's command was at West Point, Mississippi, one hundred and fifty miles south of Eastport, and General Roddy's forces were holding Monte- vallo, on the Alabama and Tennessee railroad, as remote, to the southeast. There was, besides, an important advantage in this divergence in the beginning of the enterprise, as thereby the enemy was put in doubt as to the first objectives, and was compelled to watch equally the roads to Selma, Tus caloosa, and Columbus. General Grant's orders required the movement of a force of five or six thousand men, to demonstrate against Tuscaloosa and Selma, to co-operate with General Canby. General"], [362, "348 Wilson's cavalry operations. Wilson expressed the conviction that he could capture these places and conduct other decisive operations, and General Thomas gave him permission to take with him all his availa ble force, giving him such freedom of action as the nature and proposed objects of the expedition, .positive and contingent, demanded. Thus, by General Grant's instructions, the license given by General Thomas, and the conditions of his enterprise, General Wilson became an independent commander, at least as far as all special combinations and minor objectives were concerned. He was subject still to General Thomas, as actual commander of all the forces within the geographical limits of the military division ; but he had discretion within exceed ingly extended limits. General Upton's division, followed by his train, moved rapidly on the most easterly route, passing Barton's Station, Throgmorton's Mills, Russellville, Mount Hope, and Jasper, to Sanders' Ferry, on the west fork of the Black Warrior river. General Long's division marched through Cherokee Station, Frankfort, and Russellville, and then followed the Tuscaloosa road to the Black Water creek, twenty -five miles from Jasper. General McCook's division followed Long's to the Upper Bear creek, then moved on the Tuscaloosa road to Eldridge, afterward turning east to Jasper. The crossing of the Black Warrior river was beset with difficulties, but the knowledge that General Chalmers was moving to Tuscaloosa, and the clanger of a full river, permitted no delay, and the corps was hurried across, with the loss of a few horses, and then, with pack-mules bearing supplies, wagons and artillery being far in the rear, the command moved rapidly through Elyton to Montevallo. At Elyton, General Croxton was de tached with his brigade to advance to Tuscaloosa, to burn the public stores, military school, bridges, foundries, and factories at that place, and then join the main column at Selma, if practicable. The direction of Croxton's movement somewhat covered the trains and artillery in the rear, and was intended to develop any movement of the enemy in that quarter. On the march, General Upton destroyed the Red Mountain, Cen tral, Bibb, and Columbiana iron-works, Cahawba rolling-mills, and much valuable property. The other divisions followed,"], [363, "Wilson's cavalry operations. 349 and when General Wilson reached Montevallo, on the 31st of March, General Upton was ready to move forward. And for this there was need, as the enemy had appeared on the Selma road, and General Upton, with General Alexander's brigade leading, was sent against him. Alexander soon provoked a sharp conflict, which he terminated by a charge, driving the enemy, a portion of Roddy's division and Crossland's Ken tucky brigade, in confusion toward Randolph. General Roddy attempted to make a stand five miles south of Monte vallo, when General Upton threw Winslow's brigade to the front, and opened Rodney's battery, Fourth United States Artillery, causing the retreat of the enemy and loss of fifty prisoners in the pursuit by Winslow. This action gave the type of the campaign. At night, General Upton bivouacked fourteen miles from Montevallo, and the next day advanced to Randolph. Here he turned to the east by Maplesville to the old Selma road, while General Long pushed forward on the new road. A message from General Croxton to the effect that he was in the rear of General Jackson's division, near Trion, and dispatches captured from the enemy revealing his plans and the disposi tions of his forces, called for new combinations and their prompt execution. General Forrest, with a portion of his command, was in the front of the main column ; Jackson's division was involved with Croxton. General Chalmers was under orders to cross from Union, to join Forrest, either in Wilson's front or in the works at Selma, and the enemy's dismounted men were holding an important bridge over the Cahawba, at Centreville. To secure this bridge and prevent the junction of Jackson's division with Forrest, General Wilson directed General McCook to strengthen the battalion en route to Centreville, by a regiment, and to follow with La Grange's brigade with all speed, leaving even his pack trains, to seize the bridge, and then hasten to support Croxton against Jackson. Having provided for his right flank, he next looked to the protection of his rear, against the traditional strategy of Forrest, by ordering Upton and Long to push him without rest toward Selma. These officers moved forward rapidly, without changing roads, and brushing back small par-"], [364, "350 wilson's cavalry operations. ties, developed Forrest in position for battle, on the north bank of Bigler's creek, his right resting on Mulberry creek, and left on a high wooded ridge, covered by a battery of artil lery. A portion of his front was covered by slashed timber and rail barricades. His force comprised Crossland's brigade, Armstrong's brigade of Chalmers' division, Roddy's division, and a battalion just arrived from Selma, in all about five thou sand men. Perceiving the enemy in strength in his imme diate front, General Long reinforced his vanguard by a bat talion of the Seventy-second Indiana Mounted Infantry, with the remainder of the regiment dismounted, and formed on the left of the road. This regiment drove back the enemy in broken ranks. At this juncture General Long ordered forward four companies of the Seventeenth Indiana, Lieutenant-Col onel Frank White commanding, with drawn sabers. These companies drove the enemy to his works, dashed against his main line, broke through it, rode over his guns, and finally turning to the left cut their way out, but leaving one officer and sixteen men with the enemy. In this charge Captain Taylor lost his life, having led his men into the midst of the enemy, and engaged in a running fight for two hundred yards With General Forrest himself. Hearing the noise of this preliminary fighting, Alexander's brigade of Upton's division hurried up on the trot, and formed on the left of General Long, and as soon as everything was in readiness, the brigade advanced, dismounted. In less than an hour, although Forrest resisted stubbornly, his forces were completely routed. Alexander captured two guns and about two hundred prisoners. Long's division took one gun. Wins low's brigade pressed forward in pursuit, but could not bring the enemy to a stand. At sundown the corps bivouacked near Plantersville, in sharp conflict with the enemy, who had been driven twenty-four miles during the day. At daylight the next day, the columns were in motion to ward Selma. General Long advanced to the town and crossed to the Summerville road. General Upton moved on the Range Line road, sending a squadron on the Burnsville road. Lieu tenant Rundlebrook, with a battalion of the Fourth United States Cavalry, followed the railroad, burning stations and"], [365, "wilson's cavalry operations. 351 bridges to Burnsville. By 4 p. m. the troops were in position and ready to assault. General Wilson had previously ob tained a complete description of the defenses, and having cor roborated its correctness by observation and formal recon noissance, he gave orders for the assault. General Long was instructed to move across the road, upon which his troops were posted, and General Upton was permitted, as he had re quested, with three hundred picked men, to penetrate a swamp on his left, and break the line covering it, thus to turn For rest's right, while the remainder of his division should conform to his movements. A single gun from Rodney's battery was to be the signal for a general advance, and this was to be given as soon as Upton's success was revealed. Before this signal gun could be fired, General Long was informed that a heavy force of cavalry was skirmishing with his rear-guard, and threatening an attack from that quarter. He left six companies well posted at the creek, in anticipation of the movement which General Chalmers was now making in obedience to orders from General Forrest. This force was known to have been the day before at Marion, and fearing that its appearance on the road, as had been expected, might compromise the assault upon the town, General Long determined not to wait for the development of General Upton's turning movement. He simply strengthened his rear with a regiment, and then dis mounting four regiments from the brigades of Miller and Minty, he, with these officers, led them in charging over an open space for six hundred yards, over a stockade, a deep ditch, and the parapet, and drove the enemy in confusion to the city. At the moment of victory, General Wilson reached that part of the field, and directed Colonel Minty, who had assumed command of the division in consequence of a severe wound to General Long, to advance toward the town. He ordered Colonel Vail to place his own regiment, the Seven teenth Indiana, and the Fourth Ohio, in line inside the works, and the Fourth United States Cavalry and the Board of Trade battery to participate in the attack. When the division again advanced, the enemy was occupying unfinished defenses near the town. The Fourth Cavalry, Lieutenant O'Connell com-"], [366, "352 wilson's cavalry operations. manding, was repulsed, but formed again on the left. In the meantime, General Upton had succeeded in his movement, and was now advancing on the left of Minty. A charge was again made by the Fourth Ohio, Seventeenth Indiana, and Fourth Cavalry dismounted, and the whole line participating with wildest enthusiasm, the enemy was hurled from position, and the city was penetrated in all directions. The charge of General Long, his brigade commanders leading with him, and fifteen hundred and fifty men following, was brilliant in the extreme. A single line without support advanced in utmost exposure for five or six hundred yards, leaped a stockade five feet high, a ditch five feet deep and fifteen wide, and a parapet six to eight feet high, and drove Armstrong's brigade, the best of Forrest's command, over fifteen hundred strong, in rout from works of great strength and advantages of wonderful superiority, and this was done while sixteen field-guns were playing upon them. In the charge, Colonel Dobbs, of the Fourth Ohio, was killed. General Long, and Colonels Miller, McCormick, and Biggs were wounded. The general loss of the division was forty killed, two hundred and sixty wounded, and seven missing. The fruits of the victory were in correspondence with the gallantry of the troops that won it. Thirty-one field-guns and one thirty -pounder Parrott, two thousand seven hundred prisoners, including one hundred and fifty officers, and public property of great value. Lieutenant-General Taylor sought safety in flight early in the afternoon, and under cover of the darkness, Generals Forrest, Roddy, Armstrong, and Adams escaped with a number of men. A portion of Upton's division pursued on the Burnsville road till late in the night, capturing four guns and many prisoners. The enemy destroyed twenty five thousand bales of cotton, but left the foundries, machine shops, arsenals, and warehouses of this immense depot of war material, for the torch. General Wilson placed Brevet Brigadier-General Winslow in command of the city, and instructed Lieutenant Haywood, engineer officer, to press the construction of pontoons for a bridge over the Alabama river. The next day at daylight, General Upton marched to draw General Chalmers to the"], [367, "wilson's cavalry operations. 353 west side of the Cahawba river and open communications with General McCook, who was expected with the train from Centerville. This movement looked to an advance of the whole command toward Montgomery as soon as it could be gathered together and other conditions were favorable. The capture of Selma and so large a portion of Forrest's force gave General Wilson the assurance of successful movements what ever objectives he might choose. Generals McCook and Upton arrived at Selma, April 5th, with the train. The former had been successful against Cen treville, but on reaching Scottsboro had found General Jackson so strongly posted that he did not attack him, but burning the cotton factories and the bridge, turned toward Selma. General Croxton had not been found nor even heard from ; but his protracted separation from the corps did not cause un easiness, as it was confidently believed that he had taken care of himself and gone in a new direction. On the 6th, General Forrest requested a conference with General Wilson, with reference to an exchange of prisoners. His arrogance and manifest hope that he could recapture his men made the interview brief, but through it, General Wilson learned that General Croxton had had an engagement two days before with General Adams at Bridgeville, forty miles southwest of Tuscaloosa. His safety being assured, as also General Canby's ability to take Mobile without support, there was no barrier to the movement to Montgomery but the Ala bama river, whose deep, swift current gave an unsteady resting to a pontoon bridge eight hundred and seventy feet long. Three times the bridge was broken, but Major Hubbard, aided by Generals Upton and Alexander and the staff of General Wilson, succeeded in connecting the banks by the floating bridge, and the command passed safely over by daylight on the 10th of April Selma had been so far destroyed as to be of no use to the enemy for military purposes ; and Forrest's force had been so greatly diminished and so thoroughly de moralized that General Wilson moved fearlessly forward toward Montgomery, intending to destroy railroads and army supplies and material, and then sweep on to the theater of op- vol. n \u2014 23"], [368, "354 wilson's cavalry operations. erations in North Carolina. His mounted force was now stronger than at starting, as he had captured horses for all his dismounted men, and he now disincumbered himself of all wagons and pontoons which could be spared, to give him facility for quick movement. The able-bodied negroes who had joined his column were organized into regiments under efficient officers. These men, in the first flush of freedom, be came soldiers, keeping pace with the troopers, gathering supplies from the country, and marching thirty-five miles per day. The march from Selma to Montgomery was retarded by bad roads and bridgeless streams ; but at 7 a. m. on the 12th, Col onel La Grange, whose brigade was in advance, received the surrender of the capital of the State of Alabama, and the first capital of the Southern Confederacy. But how great had been the changes of four years of civil war ! On the 4th of March, 1861, the insurgent Congress had asserted, with the pomp and circumstance befitting a nation's birth, the inde pendence of seven slaveholding states. The national govern ment was boldly defied, and blindly ignoring the contin gencies of their venture, the members of this Congress boldly assumed the independence of the South as an actuality, and talked of war as if its invocation involved no guilt, and its progress compassed naught but victories and speedy triumph. The outlying crowds of men drawn to Montgomery by the culmination of Southern frenzy in the assumption of a new nationality, echoed the bold utterances of the provisional Pres ident and Congress in jubilant ecstasy through the streets. The illuminated city was a blazing type of the fire that was burning in the Southern heart, and all the assumptions of prospective empire, in the frenzy of the moment, were removed beyond the sphere of doubt. Now, the mayor of the city \u2014 the dispirited representative of a conquered people \u2014 comes meekly forth from the provisional capital of the war-broken Confed eracy and tenders its surrender to a commander of brigade. How different the beginning and end of Montgomery in the \" great conflict ! \" The burning of ninety thousand bales of cotton, the ideal king of commerce, is now the illumination which betokens the loss of his crown and the loyalty of his"], [369, "wilson's cavalry operations. 355 subjects, for it is they who, in their desperation, set fire to this immense mass of royalty. The quiet streets and silent halls, the fleeing troopers and hiding citizens, are in striking an tithesis to the pomp, the boast, and the maddened multitude of a former day. Having destroyed five steamboats, several locomotives, one armory, and several foundries, General Wilson resumed motion on the 14th. General Upton moved through Mount Meigs and Tuskegee, toward Columbus, Georgia, and Colonel La Grange followed the railroad through Opelika, to West Point. Two days later, General Upton, with three hundred dismounted men, assaulted and carried the breastworks at Columbus, sav ing by the impetuosity of his attack the bridges over the Chattahoochee, and capturing fifty-two guns in position, and twelve hundred prisoners. The ram Jackson, nearly ready for the sea, and carrying six seven-inch guns, was destroyed ; also the navy-yard, foundries, arsenal, armory, sword and pistol -factory, accouterment-shops, paper-mills, four cotton factories, fifteen locomotives, two hundred cars, and one hun dred and fifteen thousand bales of cotton. The assault was made at night, by men from the Third Iowa, Colonel Noble commanding, the Fourth Iowa and Tenth Missouri being held in support. Generals Upton and Winslow directed the move ment in person. The enemy opened a heavy artillery and musketry fire as the troops advanced, but their Spencer rifles gave response as they rushed through the abatis and over the parapet. When this had been accomplished, General Upton sent Captain Glassen, with two companies of the Tenth Mis souri, to get possession of the bridge over the Chattahoochee. The captain passed through the inner line of defenses, under cover of the darkness, and seized the bridge before the enemy was aware of his movement. Then General Upton made a gen eral charge, swept away all opposition, seized the bridges, and stationed his troops thoughout the city. The fortifications were held by three thousand men, and yet three hundred penetrated the main line, and this primal success was followed by overwhelming victory, with a loss in all of twenty men killed and wounded. Colonel La Grange had spirited skirmishing on the way to"], [370, "wilson's cavalry operations. 356 West Point, but reached the vicinity with his advance at 10 A. M., April 16th. Beck's Indiana battery and the Second and Fourth Indiana held the attention of the enemy until the arrival of the remainder of the brigade. Then after a recon noissance, preparations were made for an assault. Detach ments from the First Wisconsin, Second Indiana, and Seventh Kentucky regiments were dismounted to make the charge. At 1 p. m. the signal was given, and these troops moved for ward, drove into the fort the skirmishers, and reached the ditch, which was too wide to leap and too deep to pass. Sharpshooters kept the enemy down until materials for bridges were gathered, when the charge was sounded again, and the detachments rushed over the parapets, on three sides of the square fort and captured the entire garrison of two hun dred and sixty-five men, General Tyler commanding, and eighteen officers and men were killed and twenty-eight wounded. Colonel La Grange lost seven killed and twenty nine wounded.- He captured three guns and five hundred stand of small arms. Simultaneously with the storming of the fort, the Fourth Indiana dashed through the town, scattered a superior cavalry force which had just arrived, and burned five locomotives and trains; also securing the bridges over the Chattahoochee. Colonel La Grange here destroyed two bridges, nineteen locomotives, and two hundred and forty -five cars loaded with quartermaster, commissary, and ordnance stores. Before departure, he established a hospital for the wounded of both sides, and left for them ample supplies with the mayor. He then moved toward Macon, through La Grange, Griffin, and Forsyth, breaking the railroad at these points. April 17th, General Wilson commenced his movement on Macon, giving Minty 's division the advance, and instructing that commander to send forward a detachment to seize the double bridges over Flint river. Captain Hudson, of the Fourth Michigan, was put upon this service, and, at 7 a. m. the next day, gained the bridges, scattering the guards, and capturing forty prisoners. The whole command followed the detach ment on the 18th. Two days later, Colonel White, of the Seventeenth Indiana in the advance, encountered two hundred"], [371, "wilson's cavalry operations. 357 cavalrymen, and driving them rapidly toward Macon, saved the Echconnee and Tobesofke bridges. When within thir teen miles of Macon, he met a flag of truce in charge of Gen eral Robinson, bearing a written communication addressed to the commanding officer United States forces. Colonel White halted and sent the communication to Colonel Minty, his division commander, who, having read it, sent it to General Wilson, but instructed Colonel White to resume his advance, and so informed General Robinson. The communication was from General Cobb, inclosing a dispatch from General Beau regard, advising that a truce was existing, which was applica ble to all the forces under Generals Sherman and Joseph E. Johnston, and declaring that he was ready to comply with the terms of the armistice, and proposing a meeting with the commander of the United States forces, to make arrangements for a more perfect enforcement of the armistice. Without giving entire credence to the communication, Gen eral Wilson rode rapidly forward to halt his troops at the de fenses of Macon, and by seeing General Cobb to convince himself with regard to the questions at issue, before acknowl edging the armistice. But Colonel White had been too quick, and had dashed into the city and received its surrender before General Wilson overtook him. The garrison made a show of resistance, but promptly laid down their arms at the demand of Colonel White. When, however, General Wilson arrived, General Cobb protested against what he termed a violation of the armistice, overlooking the fact that he could not claim to be an authoritative channel of communication for a message of such importance, and demanded that he should withdraw his forces to the point where General Robinson had met his advance. General Wilson had no reason to doubt the existence of the truce, but he was unwilling to give it recognition, until he had received notice and instructions from proper authority authentically transmitted, especially as his subordinate officers had captured the city before he could respond to the message which had been sent under the flag of truce. His force, though known as the cavalry corps of the Military Division of the Mississippi, and organized under General Sherman's order, had not yet served under his personal command, but had, by"], [372, "358 wilson's cavalry operations. his direction, reported to General Thomas, as commander of all the forces of the military division not present with the commanding general, and all his orders subsequently had either originated with General Thomas or had been transmitted by him from General Grant. Without authentic instructions from either General Grant, General Sherman, or General Thomas, he hesitated to recognize the application of the armistice to his command. He therefore determined to hold Generals Cobb, Smith, Mackall, Robinson, and Mercer, and the garrison of Macon, as prisoners of war, until his conduct was disapproved by competent authority, after full investigation. However, to relieve himself from suspense, at the earliest possible moment, he sent a dispatch in cipher to General Sherman, the evening of the 20th of April, and the next day received an official no tification from him of the existence of the armistice. Upon receiving it, he suspended all operations until he should receive orders to renew them, or until circumstances should justify in dependent action. On the 1st of May, General Croxton, who during his sepa ration from the main column, had made a tortuous ride of six hundred and fifty miles, arrived at Macon. \\Ee skirmished with General Jackson near Trion, on the 2d of April, and finding that his force was double his own, he declined battle and moved rapidly in simulated flight to the Black Warrior river, crossed to the west side, and reached Northport, April 4th. Fearing that his presence might be known, he moved at midnight, sur prised the force at the bridge, crossed into Tuscaloosa, captured three guns and one hundred and fifty prisoners, scattered the state militia and cadets, and- destroyed the military school edi fice, and the public works and stores. Here he tried to com municate with General McCook, but failed. He then abandoned Tuscaloosa, and moved to the southeast to avoid Jackson and Chalmers. When near Eutaw, he heard of the arrival of Adams' division, and fearing to risk an engagement with a force of cav alry more than double his own strength, supported by militia, he countermarched toward Tuscaloosa; then diverging to the left, moved through Jasper, crossed the Coosa, and marched to Talladega. Near this place he defeated General Hill, capturing one gun and one hundred and fifty prisoners, and then marched"], [373, "wilson's cavalry operations. 359 through Carrollton, Newnan, and Forsyth, to Macon. During the period of his isolation, he had no knowledge of the move ments of the main column, but having faith in the success of the general plan, he sought General Wilson at Macon.

You remember the plan of operations you propose in your note is essentially what I mentioned to you last winter I should adopt if permitted.

The two cavalry columns were arrested about the same time, by the armistice established by Generals Sherman and John ston, under circumstances of embarrassment to the generals commanding them, though fortunately there were no condi tions of great hazard, in suspending their operations, as each had swept through the enemy's country in ceaseless success and triumph. Their orders were so positive as to allow no discretion, even had the suspension of their operations given advantage to the enemy, through whom the knowledge of the truce was communicated. Neither did the embarrassments produced by the truce stop with the commanders in the field, but reached General Thomas, who was charged with the man agement of the affairs of the Military Division of the Missis sippi, and who had organized these expeditions under orders from Lieutenant-General Grant. For, although telegraphic communications did not reach either General Wilson or Gen eral Stoneman, General Thomas heard of the armistice through each of these generals before he received official information of its existence from the lieutenant-general. Referring to the time of receiving information from his subordinates, he thus, in his official report, mentioned his own embarrassments in relation to the armistice and the manner of its announcement: \" Up to that period I had not been officially notified of the existence of any armistice between the forces of Generals Sherman and Johnston, and the information only reached me through my sub-commanders, Generals Wilson and Stoneman, from Macon, Georgia, and Greenville, East Tennessee, almost simultaneously. The question naturally arose in my mind,"], [377, "363 CAPTURE OF THE CONFEDERATE PRESIDENT. whether the troops acting under my direction, by virtue of General Sherman's Special Field Order No. 105, series of 1864, directing me to assume control of all the forces of the Military Division of the Mississippi, ' not absolutely in the presence of the general-in-chief,' were to be bound by an armistice or agreement made at a distance of several hundred miles from where those troops were operating and of which they were advised through an enemy, then in such straitened circum stances that any ruse, honorable at least in war, was likely to be practiced by him to relieve himself from his difficult position. Then, again, General Sherman was operating with a movable column, beyond the limits of his territorial com mand, viz., the Military Division of the Mississippi, and far away from all direct communication with it ; whereas ' the troops not absolutely in the presence of the general-in-chief,' were operating under special instructions and not even in co operation with General Sherman against Johnston, but, on the contrary, General Stoneman was dismantling the country to obstruct Lee's retreat and General Wilson was moving inde pendently in Georgia or co-operating with General Canby. Before I could come to any conclusion how I should act under the circumstances, and without disrespect to my superior officer, General Sherman, Secretary Stanton telegraphed to me from Washington, On the 27th of April, and through me to my sub-commanders, to disregard all orders except those com ing from General Grant or myself, and to resume hostilities at once, sparing no pains to press the enemy firmly, at the same time notifying me that General Sherman's negotiations with Johnston had been disapproved.\" Having now full authority for indejiiendent action, and hav ing learned that President Davis with a party had started south from Charlotte, North Carolina, on the cessation of the armistice, General Thomas at once made dispositions to cap ture the fugitive President, and those who still clung to him and his fortunes. He directed General Stoneman to send the brigades of Miller, Brown, and Palmer, to concentrate at An derson, South Carolina, and scout down the Savannah river to Augusta, Georgia, in search of the fugitives. General Gillem was absent from the command at the time, and Colonel"], [378, "364 CAPTURE OF THE CONFEDERATE PRESIDENT. W. F. Palmer, of the Fifteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, assumed direction of the expedition. By rapid marching, he reached and crossed the Savannah river in advance of Mr. Davis, and so disposed his troops as to change the direction of the flight, from the west toward the Mississippi river, to the Atlantic coast. General Thomas also notified General Wilson, at Ma con, Georgia, of the issue of the negotiations in North Caro lina, and ordered him to resume hostilities at once, with special reference to the capture of Mr. Davis. These orders had scarcely been issued before the surrender of the Confederate forces east of the Chattahoochee river, to General Sherman, by General Johnston, was officially an nounced to both General Thomas and General Wilson, and the latter at once adopted measures looking to the surrender of the enemy's military establishments at Atlanta, Georgia, and Tallahassee, Florida, and to throw a cordon of cavalry across the State of Georgia to intercept and capture Mr. Davis and his party. He sent General Upton to Augusta ; General Winslow, with the Fourth division, to march to Atlanta \" for the purpose of carrying into effect the terms of the conven tion, as well as to make such a disposition of his forces, cover ing the country northward, from Forsyth to Marietta, so as to secure the arrest of Jefferson Davis and party ;\" General McCook, with five hundred men of his division, to move to Tallahassee, Florida, \" to receive the surrender of the enemy in that state ;\" Colonel Minty, \" to extend his troops along the line of the Ocmulgee and Altamaha rivers, as far as Jack sonville ; and General Croxton, commanding a division (the First), \" to distribute it along the line of the Ocmulgee,\" con necting with Winslow, and reaching to Macon. Besides, General Wilson directed that detachments should watch the crossings of Flint river, and the stations on the railroad from Atlanta to Eufala, as well as Columbus, West Point, and Tal ladega. These general and special dispositions, with thorough scouting, promised the interception of all large parties and the arrest of prominent persons. Evading the terms of General Johnston's surrender, Mr. Davis moved south from Charlotte, North Carolina, through Torkville, toward Unionville and Abbeville, South Carolina,"], [379, "CAPTURE OF THE CONFEDERATE PRESIDENT. 365 with evident purpose of passing through to the trans-Missis sippi Department, with a vague hope that he could there con tinue' the war. He was, at first, accompanied by his staff and cabinet, under escort of cavalry, from the commands of Fer guson, Duke, Harris, and Butler. Finding, upon reaching the Savannah river from Abbeville, where his last council of war was held, which expressed the utter despair of all but himself, that he was enveloped by the national cavalry, Mr. Davis dismissed his retinue, and with a few friends pushed on to Washington, reaching that place on the morning of the 3d of May. In dismissing his escort, he abandoned the idea of fighting his way to the west, and attempted to accomplish the passage by the most secret means. During the clay, he left Washington, by rail, for Atlanta, but abandoned his car at Union Point, and started southwest on horseback. Colonel Palmer having ascertained this fact, scattered his forces to in tercept him, and at the same time gather up the fragments of the Confederate forces roaming over the country. But, not withstanding great vigilance and activity, Mr. Davis slipped through Palmer's detachments, to be caught by Wilson's troopers, farther west and south. On the 7th of May, Colonel Harnden, of the First Wisconsin, with one hundred and fifty men, having advanced from Macon, ascertained that Mr. Davis had crossed the Oconee at Dublin, fifty -five miles south east of Macon, and had fled on the Jacksonville road. He pursued rapidly, marching forty miles on the 8th on the foot steps of the fugitive. On the 9th he crossed the Ocmulgee, at Brown's ferry, and at Abbeville learned that Mr. Davis had left that point at 1 a. m. on the road to Irwinsville. Hasten ing forward, he reached the vicinity of Irwinsville at nightfall, and awaited daylight to make the capture. Having learned at Abbeville of the approach of Colonel Pritchard of the Fourth Michigan, Colonel Harnden went, after halting, to meet him and inform him of his success in tracing the steps of Mr. Davis. The former stated that he had been sent to Abbeville to watch for Mr. Davis, but that he would go no farther that night. \u2022 However, after making this stipula tion, he moved into Irwinsville during the night, and at dawn captured Mr. Davis in disguise, and the small party with him."], [380, "366 CAPTURE OF THE CONFEDERATE PRESIDENT. Soon after this accomplishment, Colonel Harnden approached, and having been hailed by Colonel Pritchard's detachment, answered \" friends,\" and fell back. In the mutual uncertainty as to the identity of the two commands, several shots were fired, killing several men \u2014 a sad issue of a misunderstanding that should not have existed. The pursuit had been con ducted with great vigor by all the parties from the two general commands. A reward had been offered of which they were ignorant, from a conjecture that Mr. Davis was remotely con nected with the assassination of Mr. Lincoln, President of the United States. Mr. Davis would have made a better appearance in history, had he met the final issue with General Johnston in preference to seeking, by stealthy flight, the preservation of the life which he had often declared should not survive the fall of his country. This termination of his vaunted presidency, and the disgrace of his flight, were foreign to his grand promises and lofty aspirations. His humiliation and helplessness were, however, the fitting symbols of the cause and the government, of which in the days of his glory and power he was the most prominent representative. His descent from power was as sudden and as marked as the oft-repeated transfer of kings and emperors from thrones to dungeons, but history furnishes noparallel to such emphatic loss of acause which commanded the real and nominal allegiance of so many millions of men. And the philosophical historian must ask the question, could it have collapsed so suddenly, had its foundation been laid at the beginning in the hearts of the Southern people ? The overthrow of the rebellion was doubtless due to a variety of causes, which were strictly subjective. The mal administration of the Confederate government was a promi nent cause, but could not have been the most potential one. It has been claimed, however, by Southern historians, that it had this rank, as it demoralized the people and divorced them from the cause which they at first so earnestly espoused. The palpable immediate cause of the collapse of the rebellion was the lack of soldiers to fight for it, not of supplies or strict war material. And this need of soldiers did not result from the failure of the conscription more than from the desertion"], [381, "CAPTURE OF THE CONFEDERATE PRESIDENT. 367 of both volunteers and conscripts ; for, at the last, nearly a moiety of those who had borne arms were deserters. The first armies had been formed from volunteers, but soon mere enlistment was abandoned, and then soldiers and supplies could only be secured by despotic constraint. And it has been assumed that the final despotic measures of the govern ment produced a fatal disaffection, which did not originally exist. But it should be considered, in estimating the force and exact influence of the severe measures of the government \u2014 the conscription which enrolled for military service all able bodied male persons between the ages of eighteen and fifty five years, and the sweeping impressment of supplies \u2014 that there was need of these expedients, or the government would never have adopted them, and that consequently the potential cause of failure produced the state of things from which originated the objectionable demands of the government. Mr. Davis and the Confederate Congress would never have ignored the rights of the states, for the maintenance of which they invoked the war, had it been possible to maintain the conflict without trenching upon the sovereignty of the individual states composing the Confederacy. It was a pleasant doctrine for days of harmony and peace, but un suited to those of war. The despotism of the government, then, was only a secondary cause of the failure of the rebellion. The ruling cause was that the war on the part of the South was the expression of an insurrection and not a true revolu tion ; and the inherent vices of a false revolution may be traced from the very beginning of the despotic measures of the government. All true revolutions of popular expression have their foundation and force in the sentiments of the masses engaged in them, and will be maintained to the direst extrem ity. No insurrection that is impressed upon a people by a few leaders or by an influential or powerful minority, can com mand the perpetual support of the masses. The people may be deceived for a time by false issues and delusive hopes, and the enthusiasm which may thus be called forth may take on the appearance of genuine revolutionary sentiment, but it will not survive the revelation of the real issues or the disappoint ments that follow groundless hopes. To say that the South-"], [382, "368 CAPTURE OF THE CONFEDERATE PRESIDENT. ern people were deprived of their moral force and patriotism by their government, through mere errors in the conduct of the war or absolute despotism, is to attribute to them character too weak to warrant any movement which would involve a protracted war of immense proportions ; and the only suppo sition that gives room for the existence of manhood and strong character in the Southern people is, that the masses were beguiled into insurrection against a good government by a few men of great influence, and that they abandoned it when they discovered the deception. The original opposition to secession by a party of great numerical strength, but of feeble and incomplete organization, may be cited as evidence that the movement toward disunion was not supported by the people generally with such hearti ness and spontaneous purpose as indicated a true revolution. A fallacy, glaring in absurdity when strictly analyzed, yet sub tle, imposing, and of momentous force, when accepted, swept a multitude of originally sincere Union men into the rebellion, inducing their allegiance to the several seceding states and to the Confederate government formed by them. The fallacy was that a formal act of secession, though unconstitutionally enacted and pronounced, bouud all citizens of a state to serve the state in the extreme consequences of the act. Its force prevented all organization in opposition to the resulting war in any stage of its progress, and long enforced its support ; but it did not and could not create the foundations of a true revo lution, and when the awakening to the grand mistake did occur, the seeming revolution failed in default of the general support of the Southern people. The want of sympathy between the leaders and the masses was never so apparent as during the later campaigns of the war, especially during the last operations of the national cav alry, when perhaps hundreds of millions of property might have been saved from destruction if the leaders of the rebel lion had recognized the fact that the majority of the Southern people had abandoned it."], [383, "vol. h\u2014 24 ( 369 CHAPTER XLIL THE DISSOLUTION OF THE ARMY \u2014 SUMMARY OF ITS ACHIEVEMENTS. The surrender of the remaining Confederate armies and forces east and west of the Mississippi river soon followed the capitulation of General Johnston and the capture of Mr. Davis. Preparations were then promptly made to disband the national armies, with the retention of such forces only as were necessary to prevent political and social chaos in the Southern States. The formal unity of the Army of the Cumberland was re stored before its dissolution by the return of the Fourteenth and Twentieth Corps within the territorial limits of the De partment of the Cumberland. This reunion of the grand units under their revered commander was eminently appro priate as well as historically imperative. Their dismember ment at Goldsboro, North Carolina, occurring after their last battle had been fought, did not really impair the historical unity of this great army. Still, there would have been a painful lack of complete roundness in its mere organic unity, had two corps been disbanded outside the territorial limits of the department. During the summer of 1865, the Fourth Corps was also tem porarily detached, and sent upon a mission to Texas under General Sheridan. But it, too, was soon remanded to the De partment of the Cumberland, to be disbanded, as were the Fourteenth and Twentieth, by General Thomas. From the 1st of June, 1865, to February 1, 1866, there were mustered out of the service of the United States, from the Army of the Cumberland, five thousand and eighty-three com missioned officers and one hundred and thirty-seven thousand"], [384, "370 DISSOLUTION OF THE ARMY. five hundred and thirty-three enlisted men, exclusive of six teen regiments of cavalry, whose strength was not definitely reported. About twenty thousand volunteer troops were re tained within the Military Division of the Tennessee, under the command of Major-General George H. Thomas, until a later period. From the data given, the strength of the Army of the Cumberland, at the close of the war, may be placed, with approximate correctness, at one hundred and seventy -five thousand men. And when these heroic citizen soldiers were remanded to the duties of civil life, the Army of the Cumber land passed from organic existence to live in history as an army unsurpassed, if equaled, by any of the great armies which participated in our gigantic civil war \u2014 as one of the grandest that ever battled for country or freedom. This army fought, unaided, the battles of \" Mill Springs,\" \"Perryville,\" \" Stone River,\" \" Chickamauga,\" \" Wauhatchee,\" and \" Bentonville ;\" gave essential aid to the Army of the Tennessee, at \" Fort Donelson \" and \" Pittsburg Landing ;\" in combination with that army, but in twofold strength, gained the decisive victories on Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge ; furnished more than half the forces for the Atlanta campaign, placing upon its' banners the historic fields of \" Buzzard's Roost,\" \" Resaca,\" \" Rome,\" \" New Hope Church,\" \" Renesaw Mountain,\" \" Peachtree Creek,\" \"Atlanta,\" and \" Jonesboro ;\" at Jonesboro, represented by the Fourteenth Corps, made the only successful assault, in force, during the Atlanta campaign, carrying intrenchments held by Hardee's corps ; formed the left wing of the army which marched from Atlanta to Savan nah, and then swept through the Carolinas to Richmond and Washington ; divided the glory of \" Franklin \" with the Army of the Ohio, and that of \" Nashville \" with the Armies of the Tennessee and Ohio ; and, represented by the troopers of Gen erals Wilson and Stoneman, rushed through Alabama, Geor gia, Tennessee, and North Carolina, in swift and brilliant sequence to the great central battles of the war. This army, in its unity, never gave but one field to the enemy. But when it yielded the bloody ground of Chickamauga, it had revealed, under conditions of battle greatly unequal, its invincibility within fair terms of conflict. But even here it gained the"], [385, "DISSOLUTION OF THE ARMY. 371 fruits of victory, under the semblance of defeat, as it held Chattanooga, the objective of the campaign.

In obedience to your country's call, you left your homes and families, and volunteered in its defense. Victory has crowned your valor, and secured the purpose of your patriot hearts; and with the gratitude of your countrymen, and the highest honors a great and free nation can accord, you will soon be permitted to return to your homes and families, conscious of having discharged the highest duty of American citizens. To achieve these glorious triumphs, and secure to yourselves, your fellow countrymen, and posterity, the blessings of free institutions, tens of thousands of your gallant comrades have fallen, and sealed the price less legacy with their lives.

The general commanding announces to the Armies of the Tennessee and Georgia that the time has come for us to part. Our work is done, and armed enemies no longer defy us. Some of you will go to your homes, and others will be retained in military service until further orders. And now that we are all about to separate, to mingle with the civil"], [386, "372 DISSOLUTION OF THE ARMY. world, it becomes a pleasing duty to call to mind the situation of na tional affairs when, but little more than a year ago, we were gathered about the cliffs of Lookout Mountain, and^11 the future was wrapped in doubt and uncertainty. Three armies had come together from distant fields, with separate his tories, yet bound by one common cause \u2014 the union of our country and the perpetuation of the government of our inheritance. There is no need to recall to your memories Tunnel Hill, with Rocky Face Mountain and Buzzard Roost Gap, and the ugly forts of Dalton behind. We were in earnest, and paused not for danger and difficulty, but dashed through Snake-Creek Gap and fell on Resaca; then on to the Etowah, to Dallas, Kenesaw, and the heats of summer found us on the banks of the Chattahoochee, far from home, and dependent on a single road for supplies. Again we were not to be held back by any obstacle, and crossed and fought four hard battles for the'possession of the citadel of Atlanta. That was the crisis of our history. A doubt still clouded our future, but we solved the problem, destroyed Atlanta, struck boldly across the State of Georgia, severed all the main arteries of life to our enemy, and Christmas found us at Savannah. Waiting there only long enough to fill our wagons, we again began a march, which, for peril, labor, and result, will compare with any ever made by an organized army. The floods of the Savannah, the swamps of the Combahee and Edisto, the high hills and rocks of the Santee, the flat quagmires of the Pedee and Cape Fear rivers, were all passed in mid winter, with its floods and rains, in the face of an accumulating enemy ; and after the battles of Averysboro and Bentonville, we once more came out of the wilderness to meet our friends at Goldsboro. Even then we paused only long enough to get new clothing, to reload our wagons, again pushed on to Raleigh and beyond, until we met our enemy, suing for peace instead of war, and offering to submit to the injured laws of his and our country. As long as that enemy was defiant, nor mountains, nor rivers, nor swamps, nor hunger, nor cold had checked us; but when he who had fought us hard and persistently offered submission, your general thought it wrong to pursue him farther, and negotiations fol lowed, which resulted, as you all know, in his surrender. How far the operations of this army contributed to the final overthrow of the Confederacy, and the peace which now dawns upon us, must be judged by others, not by us; but that you have done all that men could do, has been admitted by those in authority, and we have a right to join in the universal joy that fills our land because the war is over, and our government stands vindicated before the world, by the joint action of the volunteer armies and navy of the United States. To such as remain in the service, your general need only remind you that success in the past was due to hard work and discipline, and that the same work and discipline are equally important in the future. To such as go home, he will only say that our favored country is so grand,"], [387, "DISSOLUTION OF THE ARMY. 373 so extensive, so diversified in climate, soil, and productions, that every man may find a home and occupation suited to his tastes; none should yield to the natural impatience sure to result from our past life of ex citement and adventure.

Your general now bids you farewell, with the full belief that, as in war you have been good soldiers, so in peace you will make good citi zens; and if, unfortunately, new war should arise in our country, \" Sher man's army \" will be the first to buckle on its old armor, and come forth to defend and maintain the government of our inheritance.

Though your gay and broidered banners, wrought by dear hands far away, were all shred and war-worn, were they not blazoned on every stripe with words of glory \u2014 Shiloh, Spring Hill, Stone River, Chicka mauga, Atlanta, Franklin, Nashville, and many other glorious names, too numerous to mention in an order like this? By your prowess and forti tude you have ably done your part in restoring the golden boon of peace and order to your once distracted but now grateful country, and your commander is at length enabled to give you a season of well earned rest. But, soldiers, while we exult at our victories, let us not be forgetful of those brave, devoted hearts, which, pressing in advance, throbbed their last amid the smoke and din of battle, nor withhold our sym pathy for the afflicted wife, child, and mother, consigned, far off at home, to lasting, cruel grief. , By command of Major-General Thomas.

If he did not praise you then, it was because your labors and triumphs were incomplete. Whilst the enemies of your country still defied you, whilst hardships and dangers were yet to be encountered and overcome, it seemed to him premature to indulge in unnecessary praise of deeds being enacted, or to rest upon laurels already won.

While the country is welcoming her defenders home, and their noble deeds are being com memorated, you will ever remember with proud satisfaction that at Chickamauga yours were the invincible battalions with which the un yielding Thomas hurled back the overwhelming foe and saved the day, that at Mission Ridge you helped, with your brothers of the Armies of the Cumberland and of the Tennessee, to plant the banners of your country once more on the cloud-clad heights of Chattanooga ; that at Jonesboro your resistless charge decreed the final fate of proud Atlanta; that at Bentonville you for hours defied the frenzied and determined efforts of the rebel hosts to crush seriatim the columns of the victorious Sherman. Years hence, in the happy enjoyment of the peace and prosperity of your \u25a0country, whose preservation your valor on many hard-fought fields se cured, it will be among your proudest boasts that you fought with Thomas and marched with Sherman from the mountains to the sea; that you toiled and skirmished in midwinter through the swamps of Georgia and the Carolinas ; that after years of bloody contest you witnessed the sur render of one of the enemy's proudest armies, no longer able to with stand your irresistible pursuit.

Some remain yet for a time as soldiers. The same country that first called you needs your further services and retains you. Let your future record be a continuation of the glorious past, and such that as long as a soldier remains of the Fourteenth Corps it shall continue bright and un tarnished.

The history of the Army of the Cumberland would not be complete was the disposition of its heroic dead omitted ; for never, in the history of war, have the slain of any other army been so honored in burial. The first permanent National Cemetery for soldiers estab lished by military order, was the one founded by General George H. Thomas, near Chattanooga, Tennessee. The cir cumstances under which this site was selected, have historic interest far transcending the mere fact of priority of estab lishment. During the battle, which resulted in the dislodgment of General Bragg' s army from Missionary Ridge, a reserve force, in line over a hill near the field position of General Thomas, revealed its beautiful contour and suggested its use as a Na tional Cemetery. This hill, conical in general outline, but fruitful in lateral hillocks and varied in expression from every point of view, is located equidistant from Cameron hill, which rises abruptly from the Tennessee river, where it turns toward Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge on the east, and is central between General Hooker's point of attack on Lookout Mountain, and General Sherman's, on the northern summit of Missionary Ridge. Thus it is the center of this complex battle-field. Soon after the battle, General Thomas issued the following order : [GENERAL ORDERS, NO. 296.] Chattanooga, Tenn., December 25, 1863. It is ordered that a National Cemetery be sounded at this place, in com memoration of the battles at Chattanooga, fought November 23d, 24th,"], [392, "378 THE DEAD AND THEIR DISPOSITION. 25th, 26th, and 27th, and to provide a proper resting-place for the remains of the brave men who fell upon the fields fought over upon those days, and for the remains of such as may hereafter give up their lives in this region in defending their country against treason and rebellion. The ground selected for the cemetery is the hill lying beyond the Western and Atlantic railroad, in a southeasterly direction from the town. It is proposed to erect a monument upon the summit of the hill, of such materials as are to be obtained in this vicinity, which, like all the work upon the cemetery, shall be exclusively done by the troops of the Army of the Cumberland. Plans for the monument are invited to be sent in to these headquarters. When the ground is prepared, notice will be given, and all interments of soldiers will thereafter be made in the cemetery, and all now buried in and around the town removed to that place. By command of Major-General George H. Thomas. (Signed,) WM. D. WHIPPLE, Assistant Adjutant-General. The exigencies of war prevented the execution of all the work upon this cemetery by the troops of the Army of the Cumberland, and the monument contemplated has never been erected. Neither was it subsequently practicable to obtain a brief history of the many thousands interred in this classic ground, as at first contemplated. However, while the war lasted, troops from the Army of the Cumberland continued the work of burial and embellishment. When the volunteers were mustered out of the service, employes of the quartermaster's department completed the enterprise as far as practicable. The establishment of the Chattanooga National Cemetery was followed, first, by one upon the battle-field of Stone River, and later, by one at Nashville, Tennessee, and another at Mari etta, Georgia. Chaplain William Earnshaw was charged with the burial of the dead and the ornamentation of the grounds at Stone River and Nashville, and another chaplain sustained a similar relation to the cemeteries at Chattanooga and Mari etta. In these four cemeteries were finally interred the remains of more than forty thousand soldiers. Many smaller ceme teries were established within the limits of the Department of the Cumberland, within the States of Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia, and more than one hundred thousand soldiers were interred in cemeteries commemorative,"], [393, "THE DEAD AND THEIR DISPOSITION. 379 often, of great battles, and always of the nation's gratitude to those who gave their lives to maintain the nation's life. In expression of the value of each citizen who fell in the war, the body of each was placed in a separate grave. And so thorough was the search for the dead upon every battle field and over the whole country, that their friends may be as sured that, whether identified or not, all rest in grounds conse crated for their abode forever.

Merrill, Major Engineers, late Chief Engineer Army- Cumberland.) The peculiarities of the country in which the Army of the Cumberland campaigned, developed novel modifications of many of the engineering appliances in general use by all fully equipped armies, and some of these are deserving of record, especially in a work that aims to be a complete history of the gallant army by whom they were used and for whom they were devised. In the present article, I will briefly call at tention to three points of military engineering in which the \u25a0experience of this army may be valuable to others that in the future may have to tread in similar paths of difficulty and danger. The three subjects to which I would invite attention are block-houses for railroad defense, canvas pontons, and military maps. BLOCK-HOUSES FOR RAILROAD DEFENSE Among all the American armies that fought in the long civil war, the Army of the Cumberland was exceptional in being the only one that from the beginning to the end of its career fought exclusively along lines of railroad, was supplied wholly by railroad, had its depots at prominent railroad cen ters, fought for the possession of the railroad centers of the enemy, and in general was compelled to adapt its strategy and its tactics to the novel conditions imposed by the invention of railroads, and the total change in methods of transportation that had occurred since the great Napoleonic wars, from whose records students of the military art had hitherto derived"], [454, "440 APPENDIX. their knowledge. No other American army acquired so great an experience in the art of defending railroads through hos tile territory, and therefore it is believed that a brief state ment should be made of the means by which these results were attained. Supplies for the depot at Nashville were mainly received by rail from Louisville (one hundred and eighty -five miles), but whenever the stage of water permitted, the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers (the latter with the aid of the railroad from Johnsonville to Nashville \u2014 seventy-eight miles) were used as auxiliaries. South of Nashville, the only communi cation was by railroad. When the army was at Chattanooga, its only line of supply was the single-track railroad to Nash ville (one hundred and fifty-one miles), and when, with the sister armies of the Tennessee and the Ohio, it pressed southward to Atlanta, the narrow iron band that connected them with their main depot at Louisville was lengthened out to four hundred and seventy -three miles, the whole distance being in territory either wholly or partly hostile. The success of the Southern campaigns depended entirely on holding this line with such tenacity that no serious break in it could be made by cavalry raids, or by the disaffected population of the district through which it passed. The destruction of a single important bridge would have made matters in front look very serious. The destruction of a number would have compelled the army to retrace its steps. It was therefore a vital matter to hold the railroads at all hazards, and it was almost equally important to arrange a system of railroad defenses that would require but few men at any one place, otherwise the invading army would soon become too much reduced to continue the offensive. When, in January, 1864, 1 was appointed chief engineer of the Army of the Cumberland, which position I held from that time until the close of the war, the headquarters of the Army of the Cumberland was in Chattanooga, that of the Army of the Ohio in Knoxville, and that of the Army of the Tennessee in Huntsville \u2014 General Sherman being in chief command at Nashville. As Middle Tennessee, Northern Alabama, and Georgia, and the southern part of East Tennessee composed"], [455, "441 APPENDIX. the Department of the Cumberland, the defenses of the rail roads and fortified towns in this territory properly fell to my charge. A very interesting report could be made on the de fenses of the three chief towns of Nashville, Murfreesboro, and Chattanooga ; but though the works at the first two were very elaborate and highly creditable to the professional skill of General St. Clair Morton, Captain of Engineers, who de signed them, there were no marked novelties in construction, and the influence of the works themselves on the campaigns was only indirect. Lack of space unfortunately prevents more than this passing mention. During the long halt of the Army of the Cumberland at Murfreesboro, the seven bridges on the thirty miles of railroad between it and Nashville were defended by heavy stockades built in the form of a Greek cross. These stockades were block-houses in all respects, ex cept the possession of a roof. During the campaigns that cul minated in the capture of Tullahoma and Chattanooga, de tachments were left at various points on the railroad, but no systematic effort was made to erect engineering structures for railroad defense. The army was so busily occupied in endeav oring to maintain itself east of the Cumberland mountains, that it had no time to pay much attention to perfecting its conquests by permanently holding the country gained. Be sides the main line of the Nashville and Chattanooga railroad, the course of events had given us possession of the line from Nashville to Decatur (along which the Army of the Ten nessee was supplied), the portion of the Memphis and Charleston railroad between Decatur and Stevenson, the North western railroad to Johnsonville, the railroad to Clarksville, and portions of the railroads extending northeast to Knox ville and southeast toward Atlanta. There was thus suddenly thrown on my hands for defense about six hundred miles of railroad, every foot of which lay in hostile territory, and was exposed to injury, not only from raids of regularly organized commands, but was also in danger from guerilla bands and from nominally peaceful citizens. A similar problem had fallen to my lot, when, in the fall of 1862, the Army of Kentucky, commanded by General Gordon Granger, advanced from Cincinnati to Lexington, and had to"], [456, "442 APPENDIX. rebuild all the bridges on the Kentucky Central railroad, ex cept the trestle-work at Paris. General Granger ordered me to plan such fortifications as would prevent a recurrence of such a disaster. A brief examination showed me that the bridges as a rule were located at points where the land rose gradually on both sides for long distances, thus making it very difficult to place a fort near enough to protect the bridge, and at the same time to secure its occupants from plunging or reverse fires. Safety from this kind of attack necessitated cover over head, and as the requirements of the service called for the minimum garrisons at bridges which would be con sistent with their adequate protection, I was naturally led to select the block -house as the only available means of defense. It did not seem at all probable that any cavalry command that would be likely to get over the mountains into Central Kentucky would be accompanied by artillery, and therefore the block-houses were only planned to resist attack by mus ketry. I believe that some of them were captured in 1864 by a cavalry command, but I have the impression that the garri sons either evacuated the block-houses, or else surrendered them without a fight. I was with the army in Georgia at the time, and news from Central Kentucky was very meager. The plans of these Kentucky block-houses' are shown in fig ures 1, 2, and 3, with the exception that the walls were of one thickness of timber, and there were no towers. Fig. 1. Plan of Rectangular Block-house."], [457, "APPENDIX. 443 Fig. 2. Elevation of Rectangular Block-house, Fig. 3. Section on A. B. (Fig. 1.) When General Buell was campaigning in Kentucky and Tennessee his engineers constructed stockades for defending railroad bridges \u2014 a favorite form being that of a square re- doubt with four circular bastions, the diameter of the latter being made the same as that of a Sibley tent, so that the bas- tions could be covered by these tents and used as men's quar- ters. These stockades answered a good purpose against infantry, but were worse than nothing against artillery, be- coming at such times mere slaughter-pens. With this expe- rience before me, I determined to endeavor to make* my block- houses proof against such light artillery as cavalry might be expected to take with them. The Michigan Engineers (Colonel Innes) were assigned by General Thomas to the work of build- ing the necessary block-houses, and accordingly I started out with Lieutenant-Colonel Huntoon (then commanding the reg- iment) on a tour of location, stopping at every bridge and selecting the most favorable sites for block-houses. While at Lavergne, I decided to change the location of the heavy stockade which had been built there while the army was at Murfreesboro, and therefore took advantage of the opportu-"], [458, "444 APPENDIX. nity to try some experiments on its power to resist artillery. After hitting it a number of times with solid shot from a six pounder, it became apparent that even the heavy timbers (from twenty to twenty-four inches in diameter) of which it was built, would not answer the purpose. I then decided to double the walls, so as to secure at least forty inches of timber. The tower, or second story of the block-house, was valua ble as giving a more elevated point from which to see the enemy, and, if necessary, to look over the railroad bank. It was set diagonally to the lower story so as to cover more thoroughly all the country around. To avoid excessive weight it was made log-house fashion of one thickness of logs, the expectation being that it would be vacated in case of artillery attack. Owing to the amount of work to be done, the con struction of towers was left to the garrisons after the engineer troops had finished. As a matter of fact but few were built. The usual course was to employ engineer troops to build the block-houses of a single thickness of timber, without cellar or tower, and to employ the garrisons to finish the work under the direction of the inspectors of railroad defenses. To resist plunging fire, the roof of the block-house was made of a layer of logs laid side by side and covered with earth. On top of all was a roof of shingles (when they could be procured), or of boards and battens \u2014 it being very impor tant to keep the block-house dry, so that the garrison might always live in it. With the same view the block-houses were supplied with ventilators, cellars, water-tanks, and bunks. It was foreseen from the first that a rectangular plan was not the best for a block-house, but the extra cost and difficulty of making the best form, the octagonal, and the great num ber that had to be built immediately, made it necessary to use the simplest plan that could be made to answer. Late in the war the octagonal plan, shown in Figs. 4 and 5, was adopted, and the result of my experience is, that this form is the best for an independent block-house. In the rectangular block-house each corner has but one loop-hole, and therefore the block houses are of little offensive power along the diagonals throuo-h the corners. In the octagonal these corners are cut off, and the angles of the loop-holes are such that the fire of two faces"], [459, "Fig. 4. Elevation of Octagonal Block-house. Bank removed from ih Front of Entrance. Fig. 5. Plan of Octagonal Block-house with Towee. can always be concentrated on the diagonal through their in tersection ; the former weak points are thus made the strong est. I would therefore earnestly advise the use of octagonal"], [460, "446 APPENDIX. block-houses for railroad defense. So much time was con sumed in making mortises and tenons, that I would advise for future block-houses a greater simplicity of joints and the lib eral use of spikes, abolishing, as far as possible, all work re quiring skilled labor. Spikes answered admirably on the Kentucky Central block-houses, but I was induced to try tenons in Tennessee, on account of having skilled labor avail able. I am now satisfied that the first method of construc- tion was greatly preferable. As a rule, the small railroad bridges had one block -house, and the larger ones two, on opposite sides of the track. At the very high and long trestle-work across the Running Water gorge at Whiteside, four small block-houses were built. For the protection of the east bridge over the Tennessee, at Bridge port, I thought it best to establish two block-houses for artil lery. The design of these works are given in Figs. 6 and 7. Fig. 6. Elevation of Artillery Block-house. An upper story (not shown in the figure), resting diagonally on the corners of the inner square, was added to the west block house as quarters for the garrison. To avoid an excess of weight, this story was only made musketry -proof. On top of all was a small lookout. The construction of these block houses reflected great credit upon the Michigan Engineers by whom they were built. An artillery block-house was also commenced in 1865, at Larkinsville, Alabama, but it was never completed. It was intended to answer as a fort for the gar rison at this important point, which was much exposed to attack from the south side of the Tennessee. It is proper to add that my first idea of building a block-house for artillery came from seeing a rude, half-finished work of this kind, which was begun by the Confederates in 1863, at Strawberry Plains, above Knoxville. An artillery block-house is difficult and costly to build, and is only justifiable in very exceptionable localities. I think"], [461, "Fig. 7. Plan of Artillery Block-house. that Bridgeport was such a locality, as the vital importance to the army of the two long bridges over the Tennessee called for defense by artillery, as well on the island as on the main land, and the latter so thoroughly commanded the island that artillery could only remain on it while thoroughly under cover. It may be well to mention that an artillery block-house after my designs was built in 1864, near Alexandria, Virginia, to protect from cavalry raids down the valley of Hunting creek. The enemy soon found that our block-houses were proof against any ordinary attack, and small bodies never molested them. Injury to the track of the railroad was repaired almost as soon as made, and after a while such annoyances ceased. The only serious assaults received by our block-houses were as follows :"], [462, "448 APPENDIX. In August, 1864, General Wheeler, with a division of cavalry, left Atlanta, traveled north to near Knoxville, thence west to near Nashville, thence southwest to Northern Alabama. During this raid he swept along a large portion of the railroad from Chattanooga to Atlanta, and tore it up in some places, but destroyed no bridge and attacked no block house. He struck the Nashville and Chattanooga railroad between Nashville and Murfreesboro, and attacked block house No. 5, commanded by Lieutenant John S. Orr, One Hundred and Fifteenth Ohio. The artillery fire killed or wounded one-third of the garrison (the garrison was probably thirty men in all), but the gallant lieutenant did not surren der, and his bridge was not injured. One of the neighboring block-houses was commanded by a sergeant, who got demor alized and surrendered after a slight show of resistance. His bridge was burned, but I believe no other was damaged on xhis railroad, and no bridge at all on the railroad to Decatur. In October, 1864, General Hood started north from Atlanta with his army, and General Sherman after him. All the block houses south of Dalton (except the one at Allatoona creek, which was captured) were evacuated by order and burned by his forces. After the capture of Dalton he wished to go west through Buzzard Roost Gap. In this gap, and at the bridge over Mill creek, was a block-house containing about thirty men. This block-house commanded the wagon-road through the gap, and no wagons or artillery could get through until it was captured. Bate's division of infantry, with three bat teries of artillery, were detailed to capture the block-house. The infantry kept up an ineffectual musketry fire, and the artillery, after being driven from many positions, finally got on the diagonal through one corner and concentrated their shot on this corner. The weight of metal thrown soon made a breach in the block -house, but the garrison did not surrender, and at the close of the day they still held their position. During the night it was decided to organize a storming party, part of whom should stop the loop-holes with fence rails, while the other portion were to leap on the roof of the block-house and dig down to the garrison below. At daylight the storm ing party crept as near the block-house as possible ; but before"], [463, "449 APPENDIX. giving the command to charge, the colonel, desirous to save further bloodshed, in a loud voice summoned the garrison to surrender. A white handkerchief was waved in reply, and the block-house surrendered. Fully one-half of the small garrison were killed or wounded, and it seems that during the latter part of the preceding day, after many lives had been lost and the block-house had become entirely untenable, they had tried to surrender, but their signals were not seen and they had concluded that the Confederates were enraged at their obstinacy and were determined to kill them all. I re gret that I can not give the names of this heroic garrison, as they were of course sent south with other prisoners, and I never had the fortune to meet any of them afterward. The details given above were obtained long after the war, from Confederate sources. In a series of articles published in the New Orleans Times in the spring of 1874, General Hood review^ \" Johnson's Narrative,\" and speaks as follows of the block-house in Buzzard Roost Gap : \" When en route to Tennessee, during the campaign in the fall of 1864, our army, having captured the troops stationed in Dalton, attempted to march through Mill creek Gap, but was prevented from so doing by a squad of men posted within a little fort, covered with railroad iron and constructed of logs of large size, around which was thrown up an embankment of earth to protect the troops against field artillery ; port-holes were cut so as to allow the men to fire in all directions, and especially upon the line of railroad. \" It was reported to me that field artillery had little or no effect upon this impromptu fortification, and that when the men charged up to it, they could not find an entrance ; there fore it could not be taken without much loss of time and con siderable cost. \" Major Kinlocke Falconer was, I think, severely wounded while experimenting with this little fortress, which obliged me to march some twenty miles around it.\" This account differs somewhat from the one which I have given, but I think that General Hood is slightly in error in some of the details. He leaves the impression that the block-"], [464, "450 APPENDIX. house was not captured, while I know that it was. He also speaks of it as an \" impromptu \" fortification, which it was not, having been carefully built by the Michigan Engineers, and finished before the capture of Atlanta. It may be proper to add in explanation that the block-houses were not designed to defend bridges against a fully equipped army, but only against cavalry raids, and that a raiding band of cavalry is always too scantily supplied with artillery am munition to indulge in the luxury of battering down a block house. The most serious destruction of block-houses occurred in September, 1864, during a raid made by General Forrest on the road leading south from Nashville to Decatur. The following account of this raid I afterward obtained from General For rest himself. He first attacked an unfinished block-house near the southern end of the road, and the first shell fired from his battery entered the block-house and injured some of its occupants. They at once surrendered, and the block-house was burned. At the next block-house he ostentatiously pa raded the captured commander of the first one ; and on this convincing proof that block-houses could be taken, quite a number of them surrendered without a fight, and their bridges were burned. One German captain refused to surrender, but General Forrest had with him several bottles of a kind of Greek fire, and some of his men crept up behind the railroad embankment, and suddenly breaking the bottles on the ends of the bridge, set it on fire, and it was destroyed. The gallant captain and his command held their block-house, but un fortunately lost the bridge which it was to defend. In all, General Forrest captured and destroyed eleven block houses. When General Hood, with his army, advanced to Nashville, the block-houses on the Nashville and Decatur railroad were very sensibly abandoned. Fortunately for us, the Nashville and Decatur railroad was not our main line, and the destruc tion of its bridges caused no serious loss. From the time that the block-houses were built until the close of the war, but six bridges (all small) were burned on the Nashville and Chattanooga railroad, our main line of"], [465, "451 APPENDIX. supply. These were the six nearest Nashville, one of them, as recorded above, having been previously burned by General Wheeler, and rebuilt. They were abandoned by order ; but the seventh, at Overall's creek, five miles north of Murfrees boro, was ordered to be held. Its garrison consisted of about thirty men of the 115th 0. V. I., commanded by Lieutenant H. H. Glosser. Bate's division of infantry (the same that fought the Buzzard Roost block-house), with a large force of cavalry and three twelve-pound guns, operated in its vicinity for two weeks, and fired seventy-two cannon-shot against it. Once during this time, a sortie was made from Murfreesboro, and the garrison's supplies of ammunition and provisions were replenished. The block-house was not captured nor the bridge burned. To keep the block-houses and their garrisons thoroughly efficient, I organized a speeial corps of block-house inspectors, and placed at their head Major J. R. Willett, of my own regi ment, the First U. S. Vet. Vol. Engineers. To his professional skill, zeal, and efficiency, the excellent results attained were mainly due. In his Memoirs (vol. 2, pp. 146 and 398), General Sherman thus alludes to this system of railroad defense : \" All the important bridges were likewise protected by good block-houses, admirably constructed, and capable of a strong defense against cavalry or infantry.\" \" The Atlanta campaign would simply have been impossible without the use of the railroads from Louisville to Nashville, one hundred and eighty -five miles ; from Nashville to Chatta nooga, one hundred and fifty-one miles ; and from Chattanooga to Atlanta, one hundred and thirty-seven miles. Every mile of this ' single track' was so delicate that one man could in a min ute have broken or moved a rail, but our trains usually carried along the tools and means to repair such a break. We had, however, to maintain strong guards and garrisons at each im portant bridge or trestle, the destruction of which would have necessitated time for rebuilding. For the protection of a bridge, one or two log block-houses, two stories high, with a piece of ordnance and a small infantry guard, usually sufficed. The block-house had a small parapet and ditch about it, and the roof was made shot-proof, by earth piled on. These points"], [466, "452 APPENDIX. could usually be reached only by a dash of the enemy's cavalry, and many of these block-houses successfully resisted serious attacks by both cavalry and artillery. The only block-house that was actually captured on the main [line] was the one described, near Allatoona.\" General Sherman is mistaken about the piece of ordnance in each block-house. He was too far in front to be familiar with all these details. He describes the capture of the block-house near Allatoona as follows (Memoirs, vol. 2, p. 149) : \" Before finally withrawing [from the attack on Allatoona], General French converged a heavy fire of his cannon on the block-house at Allatoona creek, about two miles from the depot, set it on fire, and captured its garrison, consisting of four officers and eighty-five men.\" The usual garrison of a block-house was from twenty to thirty men. Besides their use in railroad defense, block-houses were freely employed in the defenses of Nashville, Murfreesboro, Steven son, McMinnville, Chattanooga, and other fortified positions, occasionally as independent works, but usually as citadels or keeps for earthern forts, so that the garrison might have a secure place of retreat should the main work be carried by assault. Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, 151 miles. Fifty block houses were built on this road, two being large block -houses for artillery. The majority of the block-houses had double walls, the chief exceptions being along Crow creek, where the probability of attack by artillery was very slight. One block house near Nashville was captured by General Wheeler, three by General Hood (one being the first mentioned that had been rebuilt), and three were evacuated. These six had been partly rebuilt at the close of the war. Nashville, Decatur and Stevenson Railroad, 200 miles. Fifty four block-houses were built on this road, almost all of which had double walls. Eleven were surrendered to General For-"], [467, "453 APPENDIX. rest, in October, 1864, and burned, the greater number having made no attempt at defense. When General Hood marched north to Nashville, the remaining block -houses, except three near Stevenson and four built in 1865, were abandoned, and the majority were burned by the enemy. Three, near Decatur, were not burned, but they were probably overlooked. When the war closed, a large number of the burned block-houses had been rebuilt on the octagonal plan, and work was under way on the others. Chattanooga and Atlanta Railroa I, 137 miles. Twenty-two block-houses were built on this road, all of which had double walls. Three of these were captured by General Hood's army, in October, 1864, and burned. Six others, south of Dalton, were abandoned, by order, when General Sherman tore up the railroad below Dalton, and left Atlanta for the sea. The others were held until the close of the war. Chattanooga and Knoxville Railroad to Charleston, 42 miles. The only bridge on this road (within the limits of the De partment of the Cumberland) that required defense was at the crossing of the Hiawassee river. Two block-houses were built here, which were held until the close of the war. Nashville and Johnsonville Railroad, 78 miles. Twenty-three block-houses were commenced on this road, but only a few of them were finished. When Hood's army appeared before Nashville, the road was abandoned and the block-houses were burned, except the one nearest Johnsonville. At the close of the war twenty -five block-houses were under construction. Louisville and Nashville Railroad to Kentucky line, 44 miles. One single-wall block-house was built at Edgefield Junction. The remainder of the road was protected by redoubts and stockades, built in 1862 aud 1863. No serious damage was done on this line after Bragg's Kentucky campaign. Nashville and Clarksville Railroad, 52 miles. This line began at Edgefield Junction, went to the Kentucky State line, by the Edgefield and Kentucky Railroad, and thence to Clarks-"], [468, "454 APPENDIX. ville, by the Memphis Branch of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. It was opened, as a supply route, in 1864, but was but little used. It was designed to connect at Clarksville with steamboats on the Cumberland River, that were unable to get over Harpath shoals. Eight single-wall block-houses were built on this line, but three of them were never fully completed. No damage was done to this road by the enemy. CANVAS PONTON-TRAINS. The canvas ponton-train used by the Army of the Cum berland was somewhat peculiar. The ordinary canvas ponton has long been in use in European armies, especially in Russia, and is made by putting together a skeleton-boat and drawing canvas over it. The usual length of such a boat is twenty one feet, and this is the length of the two side-frames. These frames are usually carried on very long wagons, specially de vised for the purpose ; but as the Army of the Cumberland had to campaign in a country where the only dependence was upon a single-track railroad, it was of the utmost importance to devise some way of carrying their pontons in the ordinary army -wagon so as to avoid the cost of keeping up an inde pendent ponton-train, whose services would only occasionally be required. I believe that General Rosecrans first suggested cutting the frames in two for transportation, and uniting them when needed for use. At all events, when I became chief engineer I found that one such boat had been prepared, and seemed to do well. The two parts were connected by keys. After a care ful examination, I decided to adopt such a boat for our army, but to replace the keys by permanent strap-hinges on the out side of the frames. I sent Captain O'Connell, of the Pioneer Brigade, to Nashville, with a detachment of pontoniers, to build a train of such boats, giving him authority to make any additional improvements that he or any one else could suggest. The result was the boat shown in the drawings (Fig. 8), excepting that the framing of the sides has been changed so as to conform more to the usual model. Some minor changes have also been made, but the boat is in essentials the same that was so successfully used to cross General Sherman's army"], [469, "APPENDIX. 455 Fig. 8. Frame oe Hinged Canvas Ponton, with Enlarged View of Hinge, and of Middle Brace. over all the rivers between Chattanooga and Atlanta, and which afterward accompanied the army in its march to the sea and through the Carolinas. It answered its purpose ad mirably. So many persons contributed their mite toward the development of this boat that it is impossible to apportion the credit properly ; but I think that Captain (afterward Major) O'Connell and Lieutenant (afterward Major) Willett deserve special mention. General Sherman (Memoirs, vol. 2, p. 401) thus speaks of canvas pontons, his reference to the hinge showing that he had specially in mind the pontons of the Army of the Cum berland, as the frames of the other canvas ponton-train had no hinges : \" For the passage of rivers each army corps had a ponton train with a detachment of engineers, and on reaching a river, the leading infantry division was charged with the labor of putting it down. Generally, the single ponton-train could provide for nine hundred feet of bridge, which sufficed ; but when the rivers were very wide, two such trains would be brought together, or the single train was supplemented by"], [470, "456 APPENDIX. a trestle-bridge, or bridges made on crib-work, out of the tim ber found near the place. The pontons in general use were skeleton frames, made with a hinge, so as to fold back and constitute a wagon-body. In this same wagon were carried the cotton canvas cover, the anchor and chains, and a due pro portion of the balks, chesses, and lashings. All the troops became very familiar with their mechanism and use, and we were rarely delayed by reason of a river, however broad. I saw recently, in Aldershot, England, a very complete ponton-train ; the boats were sheathed with wood and felt, made very light ; but I think they were more liable to chafing and damage in rough handling than were our less expen sive and rougher boats. On the whole, I would prefer the skeleton frame and canvas cover to any style of ponton that I have ever seen.\" MAPS. The topographical department of the Army of the Cumber land consisted of the acting topographical engineers on each brigade, division, and corps staff, and the topographical en gineers at department headquarters. The army was so far from Washington that it had to have a complete map estab lishment of its own. Accordingly, the office of the chief topo graphical engineer contained a printing press, two lithographic presses, one photographic establishment, arrangements for map-mounting, and a full corps of draughtsmen and assist ants. During the first year of the war, maps for field use were reproduced by photography ; but these maps were objectionable on many accounts. Unless a very fine and expensive lens was used they were inaccurate at the borders, and sections of a large map would not join properly; they faded when ex posed to sunlight ; copies could not be made at night nor on rainy days ; nor could a sufficient number be made even on the best days. For these reasons photography was gradually set aside for lithography; but as lithographic stones and presses were too heavy for an active campaign, they were left at the depot nearest to the front, and replaced by a sac-simile photo-printing device invented by Captain Margedant, chief assistant. This consisted of a light box containing several"], [471, "457 APPENDIX. india-rubber baths, fitting into one another, and the proper sup ply of chemicals. Printing was done by tracing the required map on thin paper and laying it over a sheet coated with nitrate of silver. The sun's rays passing through the tissue paper blackened the prepared paper except under the ink lines, thus making a white map on black ground. By this means copies from the drawing-paper map could be made as often as new information came in, and occasionally there would be several editions of a map during the same day. The process, however, was expensive, and did not permit the print ing of a large number of copies ; therefore these maps were only issued to the chief commanders. The map of Northern Georgia, on which the Atlanta cam paign was based, was made by first enlarging the best printed map attainable, to the scale of one inch to the mile. This being used as a basis, the details were elaborated by cross questioning refugees, spies, prisoners, peddlers, and any and all persons familiar with the country in front of us. It was remarkable how vastly our maps were improved by this pro cess. The best illustration of the value of this method is the fact that Snake Creek Gap, through which our whole army turned the strong positions at Dalton and Buzzard Roost Gap, was not to be found on any printed map that we could get, and the knowledge of the existence of this gap was of immense importance to us. Sergeant Finnegan, of the Fourth Ohio Cavalry, had charge of this branch of the office, and became exceedingly expert in extracting information in this manner. Two clays before the army started from Chattanooga on the Atlanta campaign I received notice of the intended march. Up to this moment there was but one copy of the large map of Northern Georgia, and this was in the hands of the draughtsmen. I kept it back until the last moment so as to get on it the latest information that Sergeant Finnegan might be able to extract from the motley crew turned over by the Provost-Marshal General for examination. The map was immediately cut up into sixteen sections and divided among the draughtsmen, who were ordered to work night and day until all the sections had been traced on thin paper in autographic ink. As soon as four adjacent sections"], [472, "458 APPENDIX. were finished they were transferred to one large stone, and twa hundred copies were printed. When all the map had thus been lithographed the map-mounters commenced their work. Being independent of sunlight the work was soon done \u2014 the map-mounting requiring the greatest time ; but before the commanding generals left Chattanooga, each had received a bound copy of the map, and before we struck the enemy, every brigade, division, and corps commander in the three armies had a copy. The copies for the cavalry were printed directly on muslin,. as such maps could be washed clean whenever soiled and could not be injured by hard service. Many officers sent handker chiefs to the office and had maps printed on them. Although our map became less and less accurate as we ad vanced south from Chattanooga, it was still valuable even where its information was defective, because every subordinate commander had the same map as the commanding general, and therefore knew at once from the nature of his orders what he was expected to do. . If a road could not be found, still the general direction and the general object of his march could be divined, and the spirit of the general's orders could be faith fully carried out. I think that I am warranted in saying tbat the army that General Sherman led to Atlanta was the best supplied with maps of any that fought injtha^ivil war."], [473, "459 INDEX Ackworth, Ga., U.
