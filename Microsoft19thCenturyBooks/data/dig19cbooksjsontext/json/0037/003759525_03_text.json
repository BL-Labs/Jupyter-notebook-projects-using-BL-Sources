FLOURISHING PROJECTS. The Rev. Richard Preston was not one of those who favoured the gas-lighting scheme. He might have thought better of it had anyone but Mr Bromley been the promoter, but he had not yet forgiven him for stepping into the late Mr Copeland's shoes, before he had thought proper to try them on. It mattered nothing to him that his private intentions were unknown ; he had been forestalled, and did not like it, or the forestaller. ' Highfield has done very well without gas hitherto,' he argued, ' and there will be grum bling on all sides when a rate is levied to pay VOL. III. A"], [14, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 2 for it. People who want to drive about after dark may light their carriage lamps, and timid pedestrians continue to carry lanterns.' It may naturally be supposed that he would also turn a deaf ear to the Rev. John Saville's suggestion. But after his first look of conster nation he toned down considerably. 'You are a daring innovator, Mr Saville. Still, I must admit that the organ is the only instrument suited for public worship, and in a fine old church like ours the harmonium is a feeble substitute. Yet how are we to compass one without dipping deeply into our wealthy parishioners' pockets ? They don't like that.' ' Leave that to me, sir. I do not despair of a good subscription, provided I have your consent to raise one. Twenty guineas have been volunteered already.' ' Indeed ! ' ejaculated the Rector, in his sur prise forgetting to ask ' by whom ? ' 'In that case you have a good foundation to build upon. I shall be only too proud if you are successful, and will find fifteen guineas to help it on. But do not be too sanguine. This ridiculous gas scheme may block your way.' \u2022 I scarcely think so. The one is a com-"], [15, "Flourishing Projects. 3 mercial project. Those Avho invest their capital do so expecting a tangible return. I am not sure I shall not use it as a lever.' ' Well, well, take your own course, but do not trouble me with details.' The Curate, pale of face and spare of form, but with a fund of latent energy underlying his placid exterior, in so many respects a contrast to his Rector, had already taken his measure, and did not trouble him with details. He lost no time in airing his project and feeling the pulses of the parishioners. Aware that familiarity deadens the sense of beauty, he made the perfect architecture of their ancient church his frequent theme ; this was sure to lead up to church music and the inadequacy of a poor harmonium to fill a building worthy a good organ. In case the suggestions he threw out were responded to with any warmth, as in the drawing-room of the Manor House, he went more fully into his scheme, and mentioned inci dentally the offer of liberal opening donations towards an organ fund. But where there was little or no response he left his suggestion to be thought over and talked over during morning calls, and at dinner-parties, until it shared in publicity with the gas question."], [16, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 4 Yet it did not make equal headway until he enlisted the ladies in his cause. Even the tradespeople could estimate the value of good light for the display of their wares, and knew that shares were more or less marketable. But giving away their money was quite an other affair. Ears untrained to harmony were deaf to the voice which aroused them to the defects of the old harmonium. Then the Rev. John Saville became dubious whether Mr Bromley's twenty guineas did not serve to repel donors of smaller means, rather than as the magnet he had anticipated. It was not until the Curate approached Sir John Spencer on the ground of his marriage, rather than personal connection with the parish, that he discovered how the land lay. ' What ! ' exclaimed the baronet, ' has Squire Stanfield allowed that underbred lawyer's clerk to head a subscription-list in his own manor, and overtop him by five pounds ! A man with out a shilling until he married that fool of a woman ! I say nothing of the Rector, he is but a graft, has no ancestral tree deep-rooted in the soil. And doubtless he has many calls on his purse. Here, Mr Saville, are three ten-"], [17, "Flourishing Projects. 5 pound notes. I am bound for the honour of my class to take the conceit out of that upstart.' ' An unworthy motive for a worthy deed,' thought the Curate, though he thanked Sir John, who wrote his autograph above that of Nicholas Bromley with an air of supreme satis faction. ' Oh, so the upstart's offering, has blocked the way, has it ? ' said he to himself later, when the fact of Sir John's donation got noised abroad, and those who had previously shuffled out of responsibility came forward with their promises or their coin, people whose names have no bearing on this narrative. ' I am not rich,' Major Bathurst had said at the first, 'can't afford more than ten pounds.' But he straightway carried the subscription-list to his neighbours at the Hollies, and brought it back with the Misses Colbeck's endorsement to a like sum. ' Want an organ in the church, do you ? Well, it will be worth five pounds to get rid of that old hurdy-gurdy,' growled Theobald Sedg wick, like an amiable bear. It won't do to compete with one's clients, you know. But you can put down that musical nephew of mine for another five. And there they are. Now,"], [18, "6 The Slowly Grinding Mills. no thanks. We shall think the change cheap at the price.' As the reverend gentleman was leaving the office, he was intercepted by Miss Sedgwick and drawn into the parlour. ' I understand, sir,' said she, in a hesitating voice, ' that you are endeavouring to raise an organ fund. I should like to contribute, but \u2014 a \u2014 I must do it in Mr Norman's name.' The coincidence called forth an explanation from him. There was an expansion of Miss Sedgwick's eyes, a curious smile playing about her closed lips. 'Indeed! Then I am anticipated. In that case, perhaps you will accept my contribution as anonymous? You can say from a lady.' ' With pleasure, Miss Sedgwick.' Norman's astonishment when he came to offer his modest guinea, and looked over the list, may be imagined. He and his uncle well nisrh ofot to lo2\"p-er heads about it the next morning. ' Uncle, I find you have paid five pounds to the Organ Fund in my name.' ' Well, and what of it ? ' sharply. ' It is more than I can afford.'"], [19, "Flourishing Projects. 7 Who asked you to afford ? You lend your name ; I find the money.' ' You mean it kindly, no doubt, uncle, but I cannot lend my name to what is not true. It is claiming credit for generosity on false pre tences.' ' Hang it ! what do you mean, sir ? ' the old man retorted testily. ' Do you mean that I countenance false pretences ? The firm gives ten pounds. To avoid ostentation divides it between the partners.' ' I was not aware that we constituted a \" firm,\" or were \" partners.\" ' Ugh ! will be some day, if you don't spoil it with your confounded scruples,' growled Theo bald. ' Don't be a fool, lad.' They had had almost as warm a controversy the previous day over the solicitorship to the proposed gas company. The old lawyer refused to act for a company of his old clerk's promotion. ' There is certain to be some chicanery about it with Bromley, promoter and director.' ' The best way to prevent that, sir, is to ac cept the appointment. It is likely to be lucra tive,' the younger man suggested. ' Lucrative be hanged ! I know nothing of launching companies.'"], [20, "8 The Slowly Grinding Mills. ' But I do, uncle. Sharp & Robins passed two or three public companies through Parlia ment during my term with them, and registered others. They hold two of the appointments to this day. Besides, if you refuse, some strange pettifogger may be brought into Highfield to hold it, and at the same time injure your practice.' ' Ugh ! I never thought of that. Bromley's likely enough to pitchfork some sneaking friend of his own into the office, to gull the share holders all round. I suppose I must accept, if only to save my friends from robbery.' Indeed, though the Rector still held aloof, all went on swimmingly with the company. The Spencer and Stanfield interest covered a wide area. Then Dr Elliott, who figured among the directors, took up the scheme warmly, and brought in so many proposals for shares from outlying farmers and others whose business called them to Highfield, its bank, or its railway station, that the preliminary capital was legally subscribed in a remarkably short time. A bill to obtain from Parliament the necessary powers, and to consolidate the gas company, was duly drafted and prepared. Mr Bromley in private rejoiced. He was"], [21, "Flourishing Projects. 9 making them all dance to his piping, and besides looking forward to good dividends in the future, he was taking his place as a leader in the town where he had been a nobody. As one of the directors, his old master would be in a measure subservient to his interest, and so far at his bidding. But not the most captious could de tect anything underhand in his dealings with his fellow-directors. His activity was shown in securing prospective shareholders, chiefly among tradespeople. Then arose the question who should be deputed to carry the bill to London, and induce one of the county members to take charge of its passage through the House. Much to the surprise of other people besides Theobald Sedgwick, Nicholas Bromley declined the honour with a degree of self-effacement scarcely anticipated from him. His apparent modesty gained him a modicum of respect hitherto withheld. But no one knew how he bit the back of his thumb nail in private, or cursed the fate which had made London a bugbear, and his acquiescence hazardous. And none of those who saw him twiddling nervously with his waistcoat buttons suspected how he envied Squire Stanfield and"], [22, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 10 Norman Sedgwick an important office which would have brought himself so prominently to the front had he dared to undertake it. Of course, Norman went simply as his uncle's substitute. It was for him in that capacity to appoint a London ag-ent to watch over the interests of the bill, and keep the local solicitors informed. As though he had no regular London agent, Theobald asked his nephew if he thought Sharp & Robins would be suitable town agents for the company. The younger man shook his head. ' They are not the men to act for you. Mr Gifford, of Lincoln's Inn, your old agent, is better qualified in all respects. He has a higher professional status, is a sound lawyer, and up right and trustworthy as a man.' There was a peculiar twinkle in Theobald's eyes. 'Well, suppose we say Mr Gifford. I have had some transactions with him as you know. But how come you to endorse him so completely ? ' ' Because I have had from him the best of good counsel from time to time, and because I received a check whenever I sought to learn more of our unknown benefactor than his client"], [23, "Flourishing Projects. 11 had authorised him to reveal. He was true to his trust if he did keep me in the dark.' ' Don't you think that was rather hard upon you ? ' queried the old fellow, casting a glance from under his shaggy eyebrows at the younger, then tying up a bundle of papers to go with them on the morrow.' ' I thought so at the time, but I did not blame Mr Gifford.' ' Oh, you shifted the blame to your unknown friend ? ' ' I thought it hard I could never thank him for years of kindness ; but I could not blame him for secrecy, whilst I had no clue to his motives or himself.' ' Some queer crotchet or other, I dare say ! ' ' I am not qualified to judge.' There the conversation dropped, or rather was turned by Norman into a more business channel. He had no time to lose. He was engaged to dine at the Manor House, and the hour for closing the office was past. He was desirous to leave all things in order for his uncle and Jack during his absence ; but was also eager to hurry home to make private arrangements for his departure, and to dress for the evening ; a matter as important to a"], [24, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 12 man os his age, as to a Avoman, especially when seeking the society of the best-beloved. The very birds assume their gayest plumage when a mate has to be won. He found un expected additions to the family party in Stanfield's drawing-room. Herbert being at home for the Easter holi days \u2014 then coming to a close \u2014 he was not surprised to find Clarence Copeland there, nor to see Irene Preston by the side of Miss Octavia. But there was a stranger present, a mining engineer ; and likewise Sir John Spencer, and with him Lady Spencer. The party had apparently split into two distinct groups, the men standing in close con fabulation at one end ; the ladies seated at the other occupying a much wider space, in con versation quite as earnest, and a little more animated. It transpired that the Rev. John Saville had at last invoked the co-operation of the ladies. So it chanced that they were discussing the relative merits of a concert or a bazaar in aid of the 'Organ Fund.' Opinions were apparently divided. Much to Lady Spencer's chagrin, Norman was in vited to decide, both by Octavia and Irene."], [25, "Flourishing Projects. 13 ' Which do you think would be preferable ? ' they asked. 'Both,' was his laconic suggestion ; 'the one would be an agreeable finale to the other, and attract a different class.' ' Capital ! capital ! ' exclaimed the two girls, vivaciously. 'A very good idea,' said Mrs Stanfield, approvingly. ' We might depend on your co-operation ? ' put in Miss Octavia, an arch glance in her animated black eyes. ' I am fairly caught,' he laughed. ' Certainly, Miss Octavia, if you desire it. Though I am but an amateur.' What would he not have done at her desire ! ' We are all amateurs at our concerts. You will be a powerful ally,' she observed, well pleased. Lady Spencer had sat silent. She resented the intrusions of this man who made so free with her sister's Christian name, and was re ceived on so friendly a footing ; and but for the opportune arrival of the Savilles, and the simul taneous announcement of 'dinner,' might have made some offensive remark. The masculine group had been occupied"], [26, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 14 with mining matters, as the Squire explained to Norman on their way to London the next day, by way of apology for apparent neglect during their business conference. ' You see, Sir John and Mr Anderson came over yesterday in hot haste to tell us that the result of their boring had been successful. Both coal and iron have been found on the Spenceburn estate, and Sir John is likely to become a very rich man. We were discussing the best methods of winning and working both, and I kept the boys with us for their instruc tion. No doubt they would much rather have joined you and the ladies, but as they will at some time have the colliery in their hands, I though it best they should have the advantage of Mr Anderson's experience.' ' I always understood that Mr Anderson was sinking a new shaft on the moor for you! observed Norman. 'Yes. I met him first at Sir John's. It was he who suggested to me the danger of working the pit without a second shaft for ventilation or escape. He has written a clever pamphlet on \"The Better Ventilation of Mines.\" He says many of the colliery owners are slow to move even in their own interests, but that the"], [27, "Flourishing Projects. 15 question is now before our Legislature, and he expects it will speedily become compulsory for every coal mine to have an upcast shaft as well as the downcast. I saw the necessity at once, and have not waited to be compelled to do my duty. And I look forward to returns which will soon recoup the cost, since it will enable us to extend our workings in a fresh direction with perfect safety.' He was a sanguine man was Squire Stanfield. But when was there perfect safety in a coal mine ?"], [28, "CHAPTER II. RIVALRY. When Squire Stanfield and Norman Sedgwick came back from London they had successfully executed the business entrusted to them. The county member took charge of the bill, his colleague promised his support, Mr Gifford accepted his appointment, and no opposition was anticipated. The proposed Gas Company was regarded by its guarantors as an assured fact, and Mr Bromley, trampling down the stinging-nettle conscience, was jubilant. So likewise was the Squire, all was so pro mising for the colliery. The Rev. John Saville, too, went smilingly on his way, now that he had enlisted the ladies in his cause, and discovered what zealous coadjutors they could be. A bazaar was an unprecedented novelty in Highfield, and had created an excitement in the whole community, and far outside it. The Rector was the only one who did not 16"], [29, "Rivalry. 17 take kindly to his Curate's prompt means for supplying the church with an organ, and chafed not a little when reminded that he had himself ' desired not to be troubled with details.' That his placid-looking Curate should have been energetically and actively at work, whilst he was dozing or dreaming over musty papers, or rubbings from undecipherable inscriptions, in the snug silence of his study, did not disturb his equanimity. But that the said Curate should have a \"Bazaar Committee\" of influential ladies assembling under his roof at Bank View, and be able to show a generous subscription list as an \" Organ Fund,\" wakened him up, and not comfortably. For he there discovered that the twenty guineas tendered as a preliminary nest-egg came from ' Nicholas Bromley, Esq.,' and only his own sluggish indifference had covered up the fact, and prevented him quashing the pro posal at the first, as he would have done had he known. ' Had I thought your scheme practicable, Mr Saville, I should never have suffered such an item as that to pass unnoticed,' he cried, spluttering and purpling with passion. ' You will have the goodness to add ten guineas to VOL. III. B"], [30, "18 The Slowly Grinding Mills. my donation, and to prepare a fresh list ready to be submitted to the churchwardens. It would be monstrous to proclaim the Rector less open-handed in such a cause than that pre sumptuous pretender who has sprung up in the dark like a fungus, only fit to be trodden under foot.' The revised list was duly laid before the churchwardens, and without calculating the pos sible proceeds of bazaar and concert, justified immediate correspondence with an organ builder of repute. 1 You see,' observed the Curate, ' we shall require an overplus, in case we have to engage a salaried organist.' ' Yes,' assented Mr Langley, who seemed to know something of everything stirring. ' But I hear that the mistress of the girls' school is going away to be married, and we may get someone to take both posts for a trifling in crease of salary.' And this was voted a good suggestion. \u2014 Ah! About as valuable as the florid account of the movements afloat for substituting an organ for the old harmonium in Highfield Parish Church, which went flying to the Colborough"], [31, "Rivalry. 19 Messenger and trumpeted the names of the principal donors with a full blast. Mr Langley did not hide his own light or that of anyone else under a bushel, when he had material for a paragraph. It was Miss Stanfield who had suggested Bank View for the meeting of the Bazaar Com mittee of ladies. It came about in this wise : \u2014 Mr Bromley had intimated to Mr Saville the desire of Mrs Bromley to take part in the movement, and his willingness to slip aside the rings of his purse to facilitate the furnishing of a stall at which she might preside. And whilst the offer was not to be rejected, it was already an open secret to the Curate that the lady would not be welcome at the Rectory. He went with his dilemma to Miss Stanfield \u2014 not by any means the only person who carried doubts and perplexities to that indepen dent young lady for solution \u2014 and she, who did 'not believe in insurmountable obstacles,' re peated her favourite dictum to the perplexed Curate and suggested his own house \u2014 as neutral ground. ' You are a new-comer, Mr Saville,' she argued, ' and are not supposed to be acquainted with all the burning questions which set High-"], [32, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 20 field society ablaze before your arrival. You found Mr and Mrs Bromley well established here, became their tenant, and have accepted their assistance and donations in all good faith. This must be taken as understood. I foresaw some little hitch of the kind when first the sub ject of a bazaar was mooted, and so did my sister, Lady Spencer. But now that the gentlemen have sat down with Mr Bromley at the Directors' Board of a company projected by him, I should say their wives and daughters cannot turn cold shoulders to their old friend because of her marriage. Mr Preston's bitter ness against them is utterly beyond compre hension. So, if you please we will hold our meetings at your house, provided Miss Saville be agreeable.' He answered without scruple, \u2014 ' Oh, Clara will be delighted I know, and really \u2014 after the Rectory \u2014 there could be no fitter place,' said he, rejoicing to be helped out of a difficulty, and to have Miss Stanfield herself brought nearer as it were. (Alas, poor moth, the flame is not conscious how it scorches.) ' I call your daughter my chief lieutenant,' he"], [33, "Rivalry. 21 said to Mrs Stanfield, smiling buoyantly as he bowed himself out. He had good reason. Morning after morn ing she might have been seen driving about in different directions within and beyond the bounds of the straggling parish, in order to beat up recruits for either bazaar or concert, invariably with one or more feminine com panions in the carriage, generally Irene or Miss Saville, but occasionally Miss Preston or Miss Sedgwick, for each had her private circle, and now and then her gentle silver-haired mother, from the book of whose experience she was glad to take a few leaves, and whose counten ance not only gave her courage, but made her pleas irresistible. She had found so many of her own sex in isolated moorland homes eager to work for any object that promised a little excitement to re lieve the stagnation and monotony of country gentility, that confidence increased with her success. She soon succeeded in capturing the Dowager Lady Spencer, and one or two Honourables as president and patronesses. And, taking her courage in her hands, on that first meeting, presided over by the Dowager \u2014 who had the faculty of requiring an eyeglass"], [34, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 22 to see any but her own particular set \u2014 she took care that the liberal offers of Mrs and Mr Bromley were made known, even to the probability of his obtaining the gratuitous use of the Lecture Hall at the Institute for the concert. Ably seconded by Irene and Miss Saville, she thus contrived to set her old friend at ease, and make the cut direct an impossi bility, even to such an old stager as the Dowager. She, however, retired early, and her deputy, Miss Preston, beamed on all alike. Under her genial auspices, as representative of the Rectory, and those of the Hon. Sec. Miss Stanfield, as representative of county society, fresh adherents joined the committee ; contributions came in from tradesmen and others, to be stored in a spare room at Bank View ; and Mr Langley duly ' reported pro gress ' as flourishing. That condition of things, however, had called for the exercise of considerable tact and pati ence in adjusting differences and smoothing jealousies, alike on the part of Miss Preston and Octavia Stanfield, both of whom found support where least expected \u2014 from stiff-backed unpromising Miss Sedgwick, who had a"], [35, "Rivalry. 23 talent for cutting off debate with a cogent word or two. For instance, when at a later date the ques tion arose, ' Where should the bazaar be held ? and the bulk of the ladies scouted the Rector's offer of the school-house in favour of a marquee, Miss Selina rose and said, ' Perhaps the ladies who are in favour of a marquee will unite to bear the expense, provide a site, and insure their fellow-workers against the consequences of a sudden thunderstorm, or midnight rob bery.' After that, thanks were voted to the Rector for his timely offer, and neither Miss Preston nor Irene thought proper to acquaint him that there had been a dissenting voice. Arrangements for the concert had been nominally undertaken by Mr Saville and Nor man Sedgwick, with the by no means despic able assistance of Jacob Pratt, who knew every amateur, vocal and instrumental, within a wide circuit, whom to invite and whom avoid. But not content with Jacob's pilotage, the two younger men, pleading their desire for efficiency and their ignorance as strangers, found frequent occasion to consult Miss Stanfield, 'whose interest and opinion they could rely on.'"], [36, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 24 Early in June, Jacob had named several singers he knew would be 'proud to oblige,' but Norman and the Curate suggested higher flights. 'Ay,' said Jacob, ' but those folk are difficult to get, and the gents are almost as shy as the ladies. Now, there's Major Bathurst ; he sings a good rollicking mess-room song, or could give you \"Old Tubal Cain,\" like the man of might he is.' 'Oh, I'll answer for him,' put in the Curate, confidently. ' Well, then, I daresay he could persuade the younger Miss Colbeck to favour us with one of her sentimental ditties. And if the Squire's son and young Mr Copeland are at home they're good for a passable duet.' ' I'll write to Rugby,' said Norman promptly. 'And you say Miss Stanfield will give us a song ? ' put in Jacob, tentatively. ' Yes, certainly,' answered Norman. 'Well, you'd best make sure. She is not one you can make free to count on unless you know for certain. Yet if she would only give us a song like the one she sang for a charity last year, all her set would follow like a chorus and tickets would sell at any price you like.' It was a good opportunity for Norman and"], [37, "Rivalry. 25 the Curate to set Jacob's doubts at rest, and to obtain from the young lady the names of friends likely to favour them. As Jacob had said, they followed ' like a chorus,' and a goodly programme had been so far filled, in that before July was yellowing the corn and purpling the heather, it only waited for Norman's and Miss Stanfield's selections to go to the printer ; a recent addition to the village bookseller's establishment. Jacob, somewhat needlessly, called attention to this as the musical managers stood on his door-stone. Norman immediately glanced up at the church clock, said he ' should be late ; the cir culars must be despatched that night,' and with a parting nod was off down the street. He had not gone many paces when an arm was slipped within his and the Rev. John said quietly, \u2014 ' We had better go together and make our request officially. I can help you to get off the circulars.' ' Thank you. It will not be at all necessary. You are an overworked man. I have leisure evenings, and volunteered to address those circulars partly for occupation.'"], [38, "26 The Slowly Grinding Mills. The Curate was silent. He had his doubts. In his opinion between prospectuses and cir culars Norman's occasions for visiting the Manor House had multiplied. He knew how slight a pretext had served to turn his own foot steps thither, and how his own pulses beat when Octavia crossed his threshold. There was a mingled scent of pine and tas selled larch, and new-mown hay and roses in the air as they walked down Moorside Lane. The weary sun was slowly westering, but yet seemed wide-awake, as if loth to look his last on that warm month of June. Nelly Saunders was parting from her father at the lodge -gate. Her slightly-faded, apple cheeked face lit up with smiles as she saw them. They stopped and spoke, and enquired after Ben. ' Hegh, thank you, sirs, both ; he's quite well and hearty now. He never forgets your good ness to him, nor I either. I'd have had no Ben now, but for you two gentlemen. Ben is knitting some rugs for your bazaar, with wool from the Colborough carpet works. And Miss Stanfield is letting me do some needlework for it. Is not she kind?' She cast her eyes with some"], [39, "Rivalry. 27 pride on a parcel she was carrying, and with an apology for detaining them, dropped another curtsey, and moved aside for them to pass in. They found the young lady they sought, her dark beauty set off by a charmingly cool muslin dress, and a half-blown china rose coquettishly placed against the coronal of her glossy black hair. She was seated on the lawn, with fluffy ' Snap ' reposing at her feet, under the shade of a great cedar, as busily embroidering a pair of velvet slippers, as if the success of the bazaar depended on her individual industry. The scent of a cigar suggested the proximity of the Squire. Her ears might have been on the alert, she rose to receive them so gracefully, though she evidently had not expected both. Norman thrilled through his own frame as she laid her soft palm in his ; her involuntary 'You are late,' was so different from the com mon-place, ' Good afternoon, Mr Saville,' with which she saluted his pale, slightly-built com panion. She smiled graciously on both ; there was the merest shade of difference in tone and manner, but it was sensitively perceptible to"], [40, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 28 her masculine visitors, if wholly unconscious to herself. ' I had not forgotten the circulars, Miss Octavia,' apologised Norman ; ' I should not forgive myself \\ if I left such secretarial drudgery to you. I can soon dash them off when you have enlightened our darkness respecting the songs you will favour us with at the concert. Jacob Pratt is in despair lest the programmes should not be printed in time.' Mr Saville merely bowed in acquiescence. Norman had anticipated him, and said songs. His reception, and what he thought audacity, had let a flood of light upon him. He was very still as he waited her reply. Never before had Norman seen Octavia dubious or embarrassed. She hesitated. ' Really, I cannot give you an answer at the moment. You see, I am not prepared for singing in public, and shall have to try my songs over, and get papa and mamma to decide. Unfortunately mamma is not well enough to accompany me.' Before the Curate could edge in a word, Norman had said eagerly, \u2014"], [41, "Rivalry. 29 ' I shall be most happy to accompany you, and perhaps, might help you to a decision.' ' Oh, that will do splendidly ! I am really most grateful to you.' Mr Saville was not the only one who took umbrage at this gratitude. Unheard on the soft grass, Lady Spencer had come up, shawled and bonneted as if for departure. ' I think, Octavia,' said she, dictatorially, ' it would be more correct were you to consult the Squire and Mamma, before you make rash promises. They may not approve of so un becoming and public a display.' Octavia's black eyes lit up ; a reply was on her lips : \u2014 ' Pooh, pooh ! ' broke in the Squire, coming from between the cedars with Sir John, 'what an absurd fuss you are making. If the cause justifies her in begging for contributions, work ing herself blind over things like that' (point ing to the slipper in Octavia's hand), ' and selling them at a stall in a market, surely it justifies a simple song to gratify our neighbours and tenants.

' And I was not then Lady Spencer,' she might have added, for she thought it. ' Caroline ! ' called out the Squire to his wife, seated among cushions at an open window they were nearing \u2014 she was then in delicate health \u2014 ' Caroline ! Here is Beatrice protesting against Octavia singing at our concert, on the ground that it is not for charity.' ' Certainly not for charity! responded the lady, ' it is for the service of God. We should give to that object our noblest and best. Octavia will think as I do.' ' Yes, mamma, dear, though I fear my best will not be very noble.' Against this the deputation put in a demurrer. Both had heard her sing, and were qualified to speak. Lady Spencer had already drawn her Cash mere shawl round her, and sailed off in offended dignity to the carriage in waiting, leaving Sir John to follow. Defeat was not to her liking. ' They must be blind ! ' she jerked out as she went, but only the Curate caught the sharp and pregnant words. She was gone while Octavia led the way into the house, saying, \u2014"], [43, "Rivalry. 31 'Yes, that might be so in our own home circle. It is very different to stand upon a platform and to sing to scores of strange ears with as many strange eyes fixed upon you. I am not naturally timid, but I know my composure was shaken when I tried it ; and then we had no musical critics in our midst.' An arch glance right and left emphasised this. ' My dear, no one expects a Malibran or a Grisi at our concerts. You can sing with taste and feeling, and will not make any egregious blunders, I am sure. Irene will sing like a linnet, and she has not had your training,' observed Mrs Stanfield, who had caught only part of the conversation as the three entered the room where she sat. ' Well, Miss Octavia, I have never faced an audience at all,' declared Norman. 'There is no knowing how I shall acquit myself, but I hope I shall not disgrace my manhood by nervous failure.' Octavia laughed at the bare supposition. ' Failure is not written on your face or on your hands, Mr Norman. You will not fail. What do you propose to sing?' ' I am undecided \u2014 like yourself. But my"], [44, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 32 choice is limited. I must ask my friend Saville to decide for me.' ' Suppose you let us decide for you ? ' A vainer man might have translated us for me. Mr Saville did, and so did Mrs Stanfield, who added, \u2014 ' Yes, Mr Norman ; bring your music some evening when the boys are here, and you can have a concensus of opinion.' ' What nonsense you are talking, Caroline ! ' put in the Squire, who had followed them in. ' How can our musical managers get out pro grammes or issue tickets for a concert to take place at the very beginning of August, if no songs are to be selected until the boys come home the last week in July ? It is preposter ous. You be here early to-morrow evening, Mr Norman, and we will settle the ques tion for Octavia and you too. We shall be glad to see yourself and sister also, Mr Saville.' ' I'm afraid my pressing duties will not per mit that felicity,' answered Mr Saville, as he shook hands and departed, with a shade of gravity on his brow.

He was burying hope and love, and having a fight over the grave, fiercer and stronger than his fisticuff fight with the pitman. c VOL. III."], [46, "34 CHAPTER III. IN THE HOUR OF HIS TRIUMPH. Tuesday, the second of August. A glorious day, just tempered by an early shower, which served to lay the dust and keep up the prestige of St Swithin. An exciting day in Highfield \u2014 the first day of the Grand Bazaar. The school children, dressed in their best, loitering around the newly coloured and painted school-house, where they had lingered for long hours, watch ing the arrival of traps and carriages filled Avith gaily-dressed ladies and their attendant squires, to say nothing of the much more glorious liveried servants, some laden with mysterious packages, some with baskets of flowers, but all bent on entering at the doors, which were not supposed to be open to the public until ten o'clock. There, too, the smiling Rector and his Curate were busy as a pair of blackbirds putting the finishing touches to a new nest, darting in and out, despatching messengers"], [47, "In the Hour of His Triumph. 35 hither and thither, or shaking hands with new arrivals. Finch and his workmen had been busy all the previous day setting up stalls to present a horse-shoe front, only broken for egress at the curves, draping them with pink and white glazed calico, as instructed by the more ex perienced Curate and Miss Preston. A wag gonette, lent by the Squire, had gone to and fro between the school-house and Bank VieAv for the accumulated stores ; and, so long as the daylight lasted, Miss Saville, Miss Preston. Irene and Octavia had found work for the idle hands of Clarence and Herbert in sorting and distributing the same, leaving final arrange ments for their proper owners, with the excep tion of the long refreshment stall at the head of the horse-shoe. The eight or ten other stalls had been balloted for, to exclude jealousy and conten tion, of which Octavia had seen more than she liked. It fell out that she and Mrs Bromley had opposite counters \u2014 she on the right, by the confectionery stall, and Mrs Bromley on the left ; Miss Sedgwick and Irene near the prin cipal door."], [48, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 36 Such a fussy unpacking and arranging went on all that early Tuesday morning, most of the stall-holders having brought with them some thing fragile, or lovely, or dainty, expecting to cast all others into the shade. Mrs Bromley, who had pressed her friend Miss Power into the service, had done so most effectually. What her stall lacked in wool work, card-work, painted screens and fancy cushions, was effectively supplied by a stock of ornamental china, suggestive of influence with local potters, or dips into a deep purse. But, thanks to the friends of Miss Power on the coast, these were eclipsed by a display of Whitby jet, which stood out so conspicuously against a background of pink or white cotton wool in large flat cardboard boxes reared up for show, that Mrs Pratt, occupied in clearing away loose packing-papers, clasped her hands, and ejaculated, in a gasping undertone, \u2014 ' My goodness ! do they expect all the fine folk are going into mourning ? ' ' Ah ! ' said the voice of Trench at her elbow, ' if folk did but go into mourning for their sins, there'd be more call for the jet than these flowers here,' looking down on a large basketful he was bringing in for sale and decoration."], [49, "In the Hour of His Triumph. 37 ' Why, Trench, what a gloomy fellow you are ! You would put an extinguisher on the sun if you could reach so high,' interposed Clarence Copeland, lightly. ' We have nothing to do with mourning a day like this.' ' Don't be so sure, Mr Clarence. None of us know what there may be to mourn for, even on a day like this. Look behind you. What are all them things for else ? ' a sagacious nod indicating the array of jet. So much occupied had the young man been assisting Irene and Miss Sedgwick \u2014 the latter of whom, guarding Irene like a grim dragon, could very well have dispensed with his ser vices \u2014 that until he turned round he had not seen Miss Power's contribution to his mother's stall, and was certainly struck with its effect. Just then up came Octavia and Irene \u2014 the one for her flowers, the other for a basket of fruit the Squire had promised for the children ; and there was no more talk of mourning, though ample cause would come to that stall before the bazaar was over. All the morning there had been the sound of wheels and hoofs in the roadway. The old landlord of the New Inn and the new landlord"], [50, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 38 of the Jolly Pitman \u2014 vice Joe Spilsby \u2014 had been at their wit's end to find stable-room, and in their vicinity carriages and traps lined the thoroughfares ; and the local trains brought also an influx of passengers. All this time a knot of gentlemen, including Norman Sedgwick \u2014 who had come as a mess enger from his uncle \u2014 the Squire, Sir John Spencer, Major Bathurst, Mr Bromley and Mr Langley, had been in earnest conversation and the best of spirits over the news received by telegram that morning, that the Gas Bill had been read for the third time, and had passed both Houses \u2014 had, in fact, ceased to be a Bill and become ' An Act for the Lighting of the Parish of Highfield with Gas, and for the formation of a Company to manufacture the same.' ' It is a most auspicious circumstance that the intelligence should come on a day like this, when Highfield is en fete' said Mr Bromley, in high glee. ' We must accept it as an augury of good fortune and success.' And the delighted school-children having filed out, he, with a nod to the other directors, smilingly hastened to communicate the glad tidings to his wife and Miss Power, taking up a position at the back"], [51, "In the Hour of His Triumph. 39 of the stall, where he might supply that lady's want of activity. Indeed, had he been brought up behind a counter, he could scarcely have been more at home when strangers came flock ing in, and a long arm was in requisition, or a parcel to be folded. Others of the group had gone with the news to their friends ; Major Bathurst to the Misses Colbeck, whose cavalier he had con stituted himself; Sir John to the dowager, and to his wife, there as a visitor only ; the Squire to Octavia and Mrs Stanfield, who, seated and shaded so as to protect her from draughts, kept her daughter and Miss Saville in countenance. Miss Preston nominally shared a stall with two lady friends, and counted on the Curate in an emergency ; but he, like herself and the Rector, was in constant request, here, there, and everywhere. Bazaars are too common nowadays to need lavish description. That was exceptional only in being the first of its kind, in a wide district studded with historic families, and with land owners enriched by the minerals under the soil rather than the crops upon it. And so many of these had come thither for the excitement of the scene, the pleasure of meeting friends"], [52, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 40 and criticising costumes, that the area between the stalls soon became oppressively crowded, and Mr Langley, who with his brother church warden acted as money and ticket takers at the door, very early made the remark, ' I say, Chester, the cash does not come in so freely at a collection in church.' To which the other responded, ' I wish it did.' Among the gaily-dressed passengers from Colborough who alighted from the noon-day train was a woman of middle height, but lofty bearing, though in figure slender and lithe as an otter. There was a set look upon her face. And in her thin, close lips, her convex orange brown eyes, and broad low brow, from which her crisp coppery hair was parted in wavy lines, under the shade of a black crepe bonnet, might be read a determined purpose, and a spirit that would not blench or waver to achieve her ends, whatever they might be. Her dress of black silk was fashionably made, although not new, and over it a thin black mourning shawl was worn loosely, as if on account of the heat. With a winning smile, she asked her way to Bank View, and tipped the porter who pointed it out. A survey of the steps and the house sufficed. She did not call."], [53, "In the Hour of His Triumph. 41 ' He is certain to be at the bazaar,' she said, half aloud, 'and I had better satisfy myself about the other before I fetter myself with any engagement in an out-of-the-way place like this.' So she swept on with the stream of people, whose holiday garb betokened their destination, until they all reached the school-house at the turn of the road, where flags and banners told of the gay doings within. In the gateway she encountered Norman Sedgwick, almost jostling as he darted out with a lightly-folded parcel in one hand and a pink China rose in his buttonhole, a look of intense delight in his clear grey eyes. ' Beg pardon,' said he, courteously, and hurried on rounding the churchyard wall, the figure in black stepping back a pace or two, in order to look after his retreating form, as she knitted her brows and muttered thoughtfully, ' Wherever have I met that gentleman before ? I seem to know his voice, and the very way he raised his hat. \u2014 Oh, I remember now, I remember ! ' She could not see the house he entered, or follow him in to watch how carefully he put his treasured China rose in water, and locked up in his Indian cabinet the embroidered slippers"], [54, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 42 for which he had paid so dearly as slippers, so cheaply as the work of Octavia's dainty fingers and which he kissed as he dared not kiss those coveted fingers. Business was brisk in the bazaar. Fancy goods disappeared as rapidly as articles of utility; there was a demand at the refreshment stall for lemonade and ices, and even delicacies more substantial ; Octavia had early disposed of Ben Saunders' rugs to the bank clerk ; but no one had made so many sales as Mrs Bromley, though she had no pretty girl at her stall to invite customers. Her stock of china soon diminished, and so, too, her brooches, bracelets, and necklets of jet, so many of England's best families had been thrown into mourning by the Indian Mutiny. Mr Bromley, already flushed with the success of his gas scheme, leaned over the partially denuded stall to thank Miss Power for her very saleable contribution. Before the thanks had well left his lips, his smile had frozen as if into stone. His big teeth set rigidly. His skin grew livid, beads of sweat stood on his con tracted brow. With a low grown of intense agony, he staggered backwards towards a side door close by, meant as an outlet for the children"], [55, "In the Hour of His Triumph. 43 towards Back Lane, and then open on account of the heat. Mrs Bromley, busily filling up the gaps on her stall with fancy goods, imagined she heard a strange voice, and looked up. In an instant she was round the stall and by his side, all her kindly nature in alarm. 'Ah me, Nicholas! What is the matter? Are you ill ? You look just as ghastly as you did at Colborough station last Christmas Eve. What can I get you ? ' ' Nothing, nothing,' he gasped, ' I must go home. It will be the intolerable heat and the excitement. I shall be better in the open air.' ' Stay a moment, dear, just while I speak to Miss Power, and I will go with you. You are not fit to go alone.' ' No, no, no ! Go back to your stall and take no notice. If I feel better I will return.' He had reeled rather than walked through the open doorway, and this dialogue was held outside, as he held by the wall to steady his tottering steps, and so, on close under the shadow of the church, along Back Lane he went, and over the cinder-path, muttering inaudibly, ' My God ! she has tracked me down at last !

Asaph Pratt had rushed from a cottage door to support the swaying form, that seemed to have shrunk within his clothes since Asaph had seen him outside the bazaar not an hour before. ' I think it was the overpowering heat in that place.' ' Yet, all the windows are open,' interjected Asaph. ' Yes, but I am subject to these attacks,' re sponded the other faintly. Asaph stopped, put his hand into his breast coat pocket and drew out a small phial fitted with a glass cap, into which he poured about a teaspoonful of a colourless fluid. 'just drink that, sir,' he said, ' it may help you to get home. It can do you no harm.'"], [57, "In the Hour of His Triumph. 45 ' It does seem potent. You are a clever lad Asaph, and I hope a good one, for cleverness without principle is but the Devil's golden key to the gates of perdition' \u2014 a sentiment which must have been wrung from him by self-torture, he spoke so earnestly, whilst clutching Asaph's arm to steady his stumbling steps. Tall Miss Sedgwick, looking across the crowd, had witnessed his collapse. ' Dear me ! ' she ejaculated, ' what has come to Mr Bromley ? His face looks like a mil dewed parchment, or a wilted cabbage-leaf. Can he be ill ? ' The woman in black had seen him also ; had recognised him in spite of the hairy growth on chin and lip. Such ' get ups ' were not new to her. Had a doubt existed, his swift change of colour, and his precipitate retreat would have removed it. A triumphant smile lit her face ; but better, far better, an honest frown than such an evil smile. She did not hurry. He was found. She could afford to wait. Her quick ear and eye took in everything, even Miss Sedgwick's muttered exclamation, and the movements of the comely woman in pearl-grey silk and rich lace, who, after a hurried"], [58, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 46 whisper to the stout trader in jet, made a flutter ing struggle through the mazes of the fashion able crowd towards the very stall to which she herself has been invited by a frank stripling of eighteen or thereabouts \u2014 a stall like a toy-shop, where a hard-featured duenna presided over a bevy of dolls, and kept watch over a bit of flaxen-haired loveliness which put the waxen pretenders to shame.

And if he be no better, send Tim for Dr Elliott. You see, I am tied to my stall. Let me know how he is when you return.' ' All right, Mater.

Then she sauntered away, glancing at this thing and that as she went from stall to stall, past Miss Octavia and the crowded refresh ment counter, until she paused in front of the residue of jet, and whilst apparently yielding to Miss Power's persuasions, selected a jet-arrow shawl-pin, rejecting bracelets, which she play fully stigmatised as handcuffs. At the same time she adroitly contrived to elicit from guile less Miss Power a few items of information respecting the connection of the lady in the bride-like grey silk with ' the generous donor, Nicholas Bromley, Esq., whose name had been so prominently before the public in the Colborough papers of late.' All the while Miss Sedgwick's keen grey eyes had followed the movements of her black-robed customer as if fascinated. ' Why a memento ? ' murmured she to herself; 'I don't like that woman, she has cat's eyes, and her long fingers are like claws.' Then, after the sale of a few toys, ' Why, that woman is positively handing a card to the Curate. They are quitting the bazaar together ! Who is she ? What can she want with him ?

' Oh, you will be the lady applying for the post of organist, with whom I have been in communi cation ? ' he said in his quiet way. ' You have come at rather an inconvenient time for business, our Rector is in so much demand to-day. But as I understand you are only a bird of passage, it may be desirable to test your capabilities at once, before we trouble Mr Preston. Pray come this way, madam.'

' Mr Langley, this lady is the organist's 4s"], [61, "Mrs Bryant. 49 daughter I spoke to you and Mr Chester about. We are going to try the organ.

They found her in her best black gown and bonnet standing at the church gates, as at the re ceipt of custom, ready to welcome any stranger likely to pay tribute for a view of the interior. ' You'll find Pratt inside. He's for teaching Cowan's lad to blow the bellows. Though, my goodness ! I should think he'dwee& no teaching,' was her answer to the Curate, her wondering eyes following the pair as they walked up the flagged path. There was another cursory introduction ; but Mr Saville had previously told Mrs Bryant, ' Mr Pratt is our choir-master and clerk. He is not much to look at, but he is a thorough musician. If you satisfy him you will do.' Of himself, as a musical critic, he did not speak. She examined the organ, tried the stops, ran VOL. III.

Again those flexible fingers were at work on stops and keys, and at once the very air was throbbing with the solemn chords of the ' Dead March,' startling alike her listeners in the church and the busy traffickers in the near bazaar. ' Not that, not that ! ' cried out the Curate, and almost without a pause the ' Dies Ira,' was pealing along nave and aisles up to the fretted roof. ' God bless the woman ! what is she after ? ' broke from Jacob. 'Give us the \"Jubilate\" he called out, 'or the \" Hallelujah Chorus,\" not awful things like those on a day like this.' A queer smile flitted over her face. Then rang out the ' Jubilate,' accompanied by a voice so rich, and of such compass, that Jacob and Mr Saville looked at each other in amazement. Then the ' Hallelujah Chorus ' woke the echoes, the Curate and Jacob instinctively joining in. By this time quite a number of people had streamed into the body of the church ; the Rector one of the first. He had come in angrily to ask who dared lay unlicensed fingers"], [63, "Mrs Bryant. 51 on the church organ, and shock sensitive ears with music so inappropriate for a fete day. But the glad 'Jubilate' bade him pause; the presence of the Curate and Jacob gave him an inkling of the case ; he waited with exemplary patience until the last note of a voluntary died out, before he joined the trio to express his satisfaction. When Mrs Bryant rose from her seat, the question of the ' new organist ' was virtually decided. They four left the church together, the Rector and the Curate falling into the rear. Half-way down the path they were met by Asaph in seeming perturbation. ' I say, father,' he cried, 'Mr Bromley's very ill. IVe only just left him with the doctor. He'll not be able to give his recitation to-night.' Jacob wheeled round. ' You hear what Asaph says ? What are we to do, Mr Saville ? ' ' Find a substitute,' thrust in the Rector promptly, not too sorry. 'That's all very fine, but not so easy,' said the Curate. 'And I'm afraid all our friends will be so fatigued over this bazaar we shall not get our programme carried out as it is.'"], [64, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 52 A well-modulated voice put in, \u2014 ' Can I be of any service in this emergency ? I should be only too happy to oblige either with a song or a short recitation.' ' You would ! ' cried the Curate, infinitely relieved. 'It is most gracious of you. We shall be extremely obliged.' ' Certainly,' apologised Mrs Bryant, ' I did not come prepared for a public appearance, and should require some little adjustment of my toilette to be commonly presentable. But, perhaps, one of you could suggest where a lady can be accommodated and sleep when the con cert is over.' Rector and Curate looked at each other as if posed. ' There's my old room,' thrust in Asaph ; ' if the lady could put up with that. Mother wouldn't mind.' Mrs Bryant declared herself ' easily satisfied.' Mrs Pratt put up her hands in surprise, but her ' My goodness ! ' only prefaced a ' willing to oblige,' and the lady was forthwith shown to the small back room Asaph had occupied in his old home, a room which bore on walls and shelves abundant testimony to the former in mate's proclivities."], [65, "Airs Bryant. 53 It was scrupulously clean, although there was an odour of dried herbs and plants in the at mosphere. And if the window did overlook an outlying corner of the churchyard, it also commanded the entrance to one-sided Back Lane, the black cinder-path crossing the broad stretch of waste land, where gorse and heather were in bloom, the distant line of rail beyond the waste, and a fringe of dark wood on the left. Being a stranger, what more natural than for Mrs Bryant to ask Mrs Pratt, while she fussed about to provide toilette requisites and other wise set the disused room in order. ' Who is this Mr Bromley, whose place I am about to supply ? ' And certainly nothing more natural than for Mrs Pratt to furnish full particulars, even to his long abode under that roof, and to her wonder at seeing him stagger along the cinder-path on his Avay home, ' not knowing as he was ill.' Mrs Bryant had not dined, she would be glad of a cup of tea and a chop, or anything Mrs Pratt could supply without inconvenience, as the afternoon was advancing. Mrs Pratt took the hint. When she was gone the lady took a closer"], [66, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 54 survey of her surroundings. Bunches of dried plants, some in paper bags, hung from nails along the walls. One shelf held an array of bottles, with curious contents \u2014 a preserved lizard in one, a bat, a tadpole, and a frog in others. Then there was a skeleton of a rat and other such anatomical trifles. But she seemed most attracted to the books, some of which struck her as old acquaintances. She, however, found four well-used volumes in old calf bindings, not known to her, and when Mrs Pratt came up with her tea and a ham rasher, she was turning over the leaves of Woodville's ' Medical Botany,' as if admiring the coloured plates. ' Hegh ! them's the books that made our Asaph turn to doctoring. That's how they come to be upstairs. They was my father's. He was a sort of a doctor, you know.' Apparently tea had more interest for Mrs Bryant than Asaph or his books, for she laid them aside at once. But no sooner did she hear Mrs Pratt moving about her kitchen below than she took up a volume once more and read as if she had found something more sustaining than either tea, or rasher, or brown bread. The striking of the church clock warned her"], [67, "Mrs Bryant. 55 that time was progressing, and her tea cooling. She turned to the table, and her volume went back to the shelf. She was evidently a woman of resources. From a large pocket, concealed beneath her crinoline, she drew forth a small pocket-comb, and a case containing scissors, sewing silk and a yard or two of black lace. With an accus tomed hand she removed the lightly attached under-sleeves of her black silk dress, leaving the open bell-sleeves short and perfect, turned down the neck so as to form a V-shaped front, stitched in the fall of lace, and had improvised a concert dress in less than twenty minutes. Her rebellious coppery hair she rearranged in the prevailing mode before Asaph's small looking-glass, adorning it at the side with the jet arrow she had bought only that afternoon, Avith no such intention. Her two-buttoned black kid gloves were new, and well-fitting, covering the wrists. And when she stepped downstairs to arrange with Jacob Pratt about her songs, carrying bonnet and shawl in her hands, neither he nor anyone else would have supposed she had come unprepared. For one thing, however, she had come wholly unprepared."], [68, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 56 By previous arrangement with their lodger, she was shown into a handsomely furnished room where stood in evening dress the tall, well-made man she had jostled against that afternoon, the one she had remembered as her fellow-traveller from London in the fog of a November morning the previous winter. There unceremonious Mrs Pratt left her, merely say- ing\u2014 ' Pratt will be with you in a few minutes, Mrs Bryant.' She saw that the gentleman was taken by surprise as much as she herself, and that he was groping in memory's caverns for a gleam of light. ' Mrs Bryant ? ' he said dubiously. She did not lose her self-possession. She knew the light would come and boldly advanced to meet it. ' Yes, sir, that is my real name. You pro bably recollect me under my professional one. I am known as Madame Arrietta, but you will oblige me by keeping that knowledge to your self, since I am desirous to lay it down. I am here as a candidate for the post of organist, as, doubtless, you are aware, and any intimation of my profession might interfere with my election.'"], [69, "Mrs Bryant. 57 ' But this is a small place, Mrs Bryant, and the salary \u2014 ' She interrupted him ' Yes, sir, I am aware of all that.

I rely on your honour, sir, not to defeat my honest purpose.' What could Norman say ? He could recall the discomfort of the long journey, the insulting familiarity of the fellow in the Inverness cape, her remarks about her sick child ; and had no reason to doubt her bond fides. If she desired to escape from a public life, was it for him to oppose her? ' I am no babbler,' said he, ' but I think you would do well to confide in Mr Saville. He is quite the man to appreciate motives such as yours.'

It was not so easy to decide. Norman had piles of his mother's music, bound and loose, but of the lady's newer melodies none. Punctual Jacob grew fidgety. ' We shall be late, we may settle it as we go. No doubt Mrs Bryant can sing something with out music and accompany herself.' 'Certainly,' said she, as she adjusted her shawl and bonnet. ' But I fancy I saw an old song of Mrs Norton's among that music, a song which is a favourite of mine.' In a couple of minutes the song was found, rolled up, and she ready. Twilight was faintly purpling the crimson of a fiery sunset when they left the clerk's house, and when the church clock struck the last note of seven they stood on the threshold of the Institute, and there was no flaw in Jacob's reputation for punctuality. The concert was to commence at half-past. With true military precision, Major Bathurst followed close upon their heels.

Theobald Sedgwick and his sister, walking arm-in-arm, caught a glimpse of the two figures on the staircase, nodded to each other as if they said, ' All right,' and selected seats on the second bench with quite benignant smiles on both faces, although they toned down on seeing Norman emerge from behind the screen and rush towards the stairhead with what they thought unnecessary precipitation. What Norman thought was another matter. The Curate and his party were ascending, with a following of strangers, and going against the stream was not so easy as coming up. He was in feverish haste lest the Squire's carriage should arrive before he could reach the entrance, and the delicious privilege of conducting Miss Octavia upstairs should fall to someone else."], [72, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 60 He was barely in time to set the footman aside, receive her gloved hand within his, and after a mere ' Good evening ' to the Squire and Herbert, bear her off upon his arm, to the retreat behind the screen, apologising as he Avent for his non-appearance at the bazaar that afternoon. ' I assure you, Miss Octavia, I never felt my legal duties more irksome. One country client after another came into the office, and tied me to my post, like a martyr to a stake, either over this gas business, or their own private affairs ; and there could be no leaving Uncle Theobald to deal with them all. I was afraid you would think that I was remiss, or set no value on a promise.' ' Nay, I could not do that. Besides, I heard Miss Selina express her surprise at your absence, and was sure something important had detained you. Still, for novices we got on pretty well. Mamma kept us in countenance, and Herbert's schoolboy audacity served us in good stead, and gave me courage. Then our Mother Shipton was a great success.' ' Do you think she would prophesy good fortune for me were I to question her ? ' he asked, in tones lowered to meet her ear alone."], [73, "Mrs Bryant. 61 'Ah, that depends,' she replied, lightly, as they passed behind the screen, and the hood of her zephyr bournous falling, revealed against the blackness of her glossy hair the pink shell like petals of such another China-rose as rested at his button-hole. What more might have been said can never be known, for Irene darted forward impulsively and put an abrupt stop to the critical colloquy. ' I am so glad you are here ! Have you seen Clarence ? I hope Mr Bromley's illness will not keep him \u2014 and his mamma away,' she added, with quick consciousness that her anxiety about Clarence was a trifle too pronounced. The small space behind the screen was becoming uncomfortably crowded, ladies' dresses took up so much room. The Major had brought in Miss Lucy Colbeck, and Herbert two sisters named Lumley. Then came the Curate with a Miss Heath and his sister Clara, and, just before Jacob returned, in came Clarence, all in haste and heat. Something had gone wrong. He looked round, too much preoccupied to distinguish anyone. A light hand was laid upon his arm. ' Is anything the matter, Clarence ? ' It was Irene who spoke."], [74, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 62 'Matter? I should think there was,' he answered, bitterly ; ' I know there'll be a row at our house when I get home to-night,' he added hotly, his nostrils all in a quiver. ' Row ? What about, old chap ? ' thrust in Herbert, eagerly. 'Oh, quite enough. I carried a message from Mr Bromley to the librarian, and there in the library I saw set up, as ' The gift of Nicholas Bromley, Esq.,' two cases of my father's fossils and minerals from our own library. What right had he to give the collec tion away ? ' ' Every legal light, Mr. Copeland,' put in Norman Sedgwick, ' and I should strongly advise you to take it calmly.' There were listening ears ready to catch his reply, for Clarence had not spoken in whispers. ' Calmly, by Jove ! Not if \u2014 ' His impetuous declaration was cut short by the smart rap-tap-tap of Jacob's bow upon his violin, followed by the words, ' Get ready, ladies and gentlemen ! Time's up, and the hall is full,' \u2014 spoken as the director of the concert, not the mere parish clerk. Jacob was somebody on such occasions."], [75, "63 CHAPTER V. A DOUBTFUL SUCCESS. Amateur concerts have pretty much the same character ; and it would be scarcely worth while to chronicle this in extenso but for its after consequences. As it is, we may slur over briefly the opening pianoforte duet by Miss Saville and a Miss Heath, whom Major Bathurst followed, trolling out ' Old Tubal - Cain ' with vigorous appre ciation. The Major's song was loudly encored, but he did not respond. He preferred to lead Miss Lucy Colbeck on to the platform to favour the company with ' She wore a Wreath of Roses,' which she had pretty well worn out. But when Clarence and Herbert took their places to sing 'All's Well,' it was quite per-"], [76, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 64 ceptible to their friends in the front that all was not well with one of the singers. For the face of Clarence was like an open book, and there were angry lines on it not all Irene's tact had been able to smooth away, and his responsive ' All's well, Good Night ! ' was not as steady as it had been at the rehearsal the evening before. ' I wonder what has disturbed Clarence ? ' whispered his mother to Miss Power. ' He looks flushed and does not sing so well as usual.' A bony hand was laid on the shoulder of the Squire, and Theobald Sedgwick bent down to the ear just below him, \u2014 ' I say, Squire, do you notice young Copeland?' ' Yes, I should say something had gone Avrong, either here or at home.' 'Humph! So should I \u2014 but \u2014 either \u2014 ?' This last word was shut in by his closing lips, and his ' Jealous, maybe,' was thought, not spoken, hope fathering the thought. Confirmation, or what served for it, came on the platform with Irene, something of a cloud evidently dimming the sunshine of her dark blue eyes. And although she gave to ' Katy's Letter ' all the artless simplicity of her own"], [77, "A Doubtful Success. 65 nature, her sweet voice lacked its customary clearness and charm. Nothing to be noted by strangers, but pal pable enough to her friends, one and all of whom concluded that some unpleasantness had arisen between herself and her old friend Clarence, though no one guessed at the truth. And no one else appeared affected. Mr Saville took his auditory by surprise, his slight physique giving no intimation of the fine, well-cultivated tenor voice that filled the hall, as he sangf ' The Pilot ' with both force and feeling. Indeed, it was much more generally appre ciated than the operatic scene between Norma and Adelgisa, with which the Misses Lumley favoured the front benches. After that Mr Saville led Mrs Bryant for ward, with the preface that ' the lady had kindly undertaken to supply the place of Mr Bromley, who had been seized with sudden illness, and was unable to appear.' With just a word to Norman Sedgwick at the piano, Mrs Bryant took his seat, ran her long lithe fingers over the keys, and, without book, her face half-turned to the audience sent Tennyson's ' Brook,' that most musical VOL. III. E"], [78, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 66 of streams, gliding and rippling along clearly and melodiously as if voice and instrument had been both attuned by the poet. There was a genuine burst of applause when she had finished. Behind the screen there was a flutter of feminine fans and fears. The strange lady in black had eclipsed them all. ' Who is she ? ' ' Where did the Curate pick her up ? ' ' It is humiliating to be snuffed out by a woman no one knows ! ' and so forth, was said. As the feminine offender descended to her seat behind the screen, one of the group, a maiden with lustrous black eyes and hair, dressed in a pale pink silk, partially hidden by a diaphanous white bournous, was saying with some spirit, ' N'importe ! we came here to do our best in a most excellent cause, not, I should hope, to show off our own fancied abilities, or to envy the superior powers of a gracious and good-natured stranger. I am really ashamed of you, Margaret!' (to Miss Lumley) 'I shall not sing worse because I have heard someone else do better ; neither will Irene Preston.' The speaker paused. Her ear had evidently been arrested by a rich, well-modulated mascul ine voice, giving, with taste and expression,"], [79, "A Doubtful Success. 67 ' Come into the Garden, Maud,' and the watch ing stranger saw, or thought she saw, the young lady's eyelids droop, and a faint tinge of colour rise to her cheeks as if song and singer had exceptional interest for her. The applause had not ceased when the Curate, who had been standing on the steps, close to Mrs Bryant, made a sign to Octavia, who fancied he looked paler than ordinary, and set it down to the overpowering heat. She at once threw off her bournous and allowed him to hand her to the front of the platform, where she made her curtsey to the audience without daring to glance towards the piano, where sat Norman ready to accompany her. Her song was not a new one even then. It was Mrs Hemans' ' Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers,' and it became more effective from the force of her own character thrown into it than from any matchless quality of voice or skill, though neither was indifferent. Lady Spencer listened and curled her lips in scorn. ' That is Octavia all out. Freedom to think, freedom to act, freedom to despise con ventionalities and the convenances of society, and worship a god of her own creating. We shall have to keep a careful watch over my"], [80, "68 The Slowly Grinding Mills. lady, or she may be doing something outrage ous,' was her unspoken thought, whilst the hall rang with plaudits, loudest from the occupants of the back benches, to whom freedom of thought and action was the mainspring of manhood. ' Ah,' said Octavia to Norman as he con ducted her from the platform, ' it was Mrs Hemans who won that applause for me. We north-country people are dear lovers of free dom.' Jacob Pratt was left standing there alone, his violin under his chin, his bow raised, only waiting to sweep it across the strings, and prove to the people that if not exactly a Sivori, they had a violinist of no common power buried in the wilds of Highfield. Songs and duets followed which we need not chronicle. It became Norman's turn to sing again. Mr Saville should have played the accompaniment, but for some unexplained reason he asked Mrs Bryant to become his substitute. Under the English title of 'The Standard Bearer,' Lindpainter's 'Die Fahnwacht' had, in different versions, long been popular in musi cal centres. The refrain of the one Norman"], [81, "A Doubtful Success. 69 Sedgwick had elected to sing that night created a sensation he had not contemplated, \u2014 ' The lady of my love I may not name, Although I wear her colours as a token, But I will fight for liberty and fame Beneath the banner where my vow was spoken.' Had Norman any thought how the delicate pink rose at his button-hole would point his song ? Carried away by the fervour of his own feelings, and the chivalrous sentiment of the composition, he failed to observe glances and whispering among the party from the Manor House, or that amid the general cries of ' En core ! ' that party preserved a strict silence, and barely waited until he gave a repetition of the last stanza, to rise from their seats, as if for pre mature departure. Mrs Bryant's second song succeeded. He did not quit the platform, but took the seat she vacated, in order to perform for her the service she had just done him. Then he beheld a long blank line of baize-covered bench where the Stanfields had been seated, and had a vague impression that Lady Spencer must have grown weary of her unbacked seat, or of the perform ance, and that politeness had induced the others to depart with her. It had not then dawned"], [82, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 70 upon him that he had caused their abrupt exit. In another moment his eyes were on the notes before him, his fingers on the keys, whilst Mrs Bryant gave with infinite pathos Mrs Norton's touching but sad ' Love not ! ' There were some present who said that when the songstress dwelt on the lines \u2014 ' Love not, love not ! The thing you love may die \u2014 May perish from this gay and gladsome earth,' \u2014 her own eyes were suffused with tears, and certainly when the last note died away hers were not the only loaded eyelashes. Norman himself felt a choking sensation in his throat, for he thought of the mournful time when his own mother had sung that song. And raising his head, he was surprised to see his Uncle Theobald rise all in a tremor, and hurry his sister, Selina, out before more than half the song was sung. His eccentricities, however, astonished no one, the marvel had been to see him in a concert hall. No one else stirred, and the lady retired amid deafening applause, for north country audiences are not slow to testify their appreciation \u2014 or otherwise."], [83, "A Doubtful Success. 71 To Norman's intense disappointment, when he found himself behind the screen again there was no Octavia. Lady Spencer had carried her sister off, and Irene Preston was in dismay. Octavia was to have sung 'What are the Wild Waves say ing ? ' along with her, and she appealed to him in her dilemma. He adjusted matters so far as to induce Miss Saville to take part in the duet. But the concert had lost all its interest for him, and he was glad to resign the piano to a cap able amateur, ' only too willing to oblige.' Something had certainly gone wrong. From the Rev. John he learned that Lady Spencer did not feel well, and had been compelled to retire. But Irene innocently expressed an opinion that her ladyship was vexed over something \u2014 something about a rose. ' She was always saying or doing something to annoy dear Octavia.' She let a flood of light in upon Norman. That unlucky rose which he had accepted so gladly, and which Trench had graciously and proudly offered to the defender of his son-in-law, with the remark, ' I thought you might like it for your button-hole, sir; it is Miss Stanfield's"], [84, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 72 favourite flower, and there is but another bloom on the tree, for the season is over ' \u2014 that un lucky little rose must have wrought incalculable mischief. If he had indulged a passing thought that it might prove through his song a voiceless interpreter of his heart's secret to Octavia, it was to her only. He saw then how the unfor tunate coincidence of a similar flower in her hair, and the very colour of her dress, must have conveyed a false impression to the minds of her friends, an impression it would be im possible to efface, and as damaging to the young lady as to himself. They would imagine the rose her gift, the duplicate adoption anything but fortuitous. He had done his best-beloved a cruel injustice, when he would have shed his heart's blood to save her pain. It could only be remedied by honest avowal of his passion to her, and to the Squire. With the thought his own presumption struck at him like a poignard. ' What was he, that he should dare to lift up his eyes to Squire Stanfield's daughter? He had no means beyond his salary, good though it might be, and Uncle Theobald had . said nothing more about the partnership. He must have been mad to tempt fate by that song after"], [85, "A Doubtful Success. 73 seeing the rose in Octavia's hair. And he must have been mad, too, after years of patient plod ding towards success, to let a pair of black eyes steal his senses and overthrow all his plans ! ' He threw himself upon his bed that night in anything but an enviable frame of mind, and tossed upon his pillow in sleepless agitation. There was no midnight sprite to whisper in his ear all that his songs and ' token ' had been to Octavia. How she had mentally compared him to the chivalrous knights of old, and how her heart had glowed and her cheeks kindled as she felt the assurance of his secret devotion, and rejoiced at the knowledge. Or of the rude awakening that had come with her haughty sister's ' social convenances,' \u2014 the awakening of feminine shame and family pride, and the con sciousness that she had surrendered her heart unsought to one Beatrice stigmatised as ' a mere lawyer's clerk ' ; and that others saw it ! She had one consolation, that his ancestry was equal to her own ; yet that scarcely served her as a shield against her own pride and her sister's scorn. Monetarily and broadly the concert was a success. To individuals, as we have seen, it was something of a failure."], [86, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 74 ' Irene,' said the Rector to his daughter as they drove home, ' what ailed you to-night ? You looked pale and did not sing as well as usual. Had there been any disagreement be tween you and Clarence ? ' 'Oh dear, no, papa,' and then she burst into tears, ' but I fear there will be a terrible dis turbance when he gets home, he is so angry with his stepfather.' ' Indeed ? And what has the sneaking inter loper been doing now ? ' The story was told, and her fruitless attempts at pacification. ' Pacify ? I should think not. The presum ing upstart deserves a sound drubbing, and if I were in the boy's place he would get it.' ' Oh, father ! ' ' Oh, brother ! ' broke from his two women-kind, just as the brougham drove in at the Rectory gate, and the presence of strangers imposed silence. For that night at least Irene's fears were groundless. Not that the temper of Clarence had cooled by any means, but that Mr Bromley was ' in bed, ill, and not to be disturbed,' according to Dinah's report of Dr Elliott's orders ; and the stepson was not such a brute as to vent his exasperation, however just, on a"], [87, "A Doubtful Success. 75 sick man. Yet he could not keep his indigna tion so closely bottled up as to leave his mother wholly at ease. He told her what he had seen, and how the discovery had almost taken the breath out of him. ' It is all very grand for Mr Bromley to pur chase popularity at a cheap rate, as the generous donor of a collection he can neither understand nor appreciate. But I am surprised, mother, to think that you could stand tamely by and permit the spoliation of my father's treasures.' ' I \u2014 I \u2014 could not help it, my dear. I did object, but Mr Bromley said they would be of benefit to students there, if useless here,' and she put her handkerchief dolorously to her eyes. ' Benefit students ? Pshaw ! Much he cares for the students ! The frog aspires to be the size of the ox. It is an old story, mother. But I don't wish to grieve you. Perhaps you could not help it. I shall have it out with him! For that he might wait. Mr Bromley was really ill, though be had in fact gone to bed as a refuge. He could grind his teeth and clench his hand there in secret. He could bury his head in the bed-clothes, as the ostrich buries its head in the sand and fancies itself unseen."], [88, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 76 Dr Elliott said that his system appeared to have sustained a shock. This the patient, who in imagination saw the glittering sword of Damocles suspended over his devoted head by only a single hair, denied emphatically. He would admit excitement, overpowering heat, a tendency to such attacks, but no shock. The doctor was puzzled. He said, on his second visit, that the malady was more mental than physical, but he could not prognose at that stage whether it tended to jaundice or gastric fever, most likely the former. The patient must be kept quiet, and take his medicine regularly. Quiet he was kept, so far as Clarence was concerned, but he had a feverish hankering after outside news. And, of course, he heard all about the bazaar and the strange lady in black who had so graciously filled the gap made by his absence from the concert. Then, after the second day's sale, when the bazaar was over, and the gains calculated, came the good Curate to visit the sick man on the Thursday morning, to tell of its success, and still further to disturb the troubled waters with the agreeable intelligence that a Mrs"], [89, "A Doubtful Success. 77 Bryant, from London, had been engaged as organist, and singularly enough had taken a couple of rooms at Jacob Pratt's. Quite an addition to the musical meetings under that roof. Certainly, if he had troubled the waters, he had not brought healing on his wings. Nicholas Bromley was very shortly as yellow as the gold he felt surely slipping from his fingers. He was enduring unseen tortures, and every fresh news-bringer gave the lever of the rack another turn. Very peculiar was the smile of Mrs Bryant when, in the midst of negotiations for Asaph's small bedroom over the back kitchen, and the occasional use of an adjoining front sitting-room dedicated to Jacob's private pupils, the inter esting intelligence that Mr Bromley still kept his bed was furnished by Mrs Pratt. ' You don't say so ! Really ill ? Surely I saw the lady and her friend at the concert ! Naturally I concluded the gentleman was better.

But she had dropped a suggestion into lank Mrs Pratt's busy brain, and when her new lodger had departed by rail, she turned it over to Jacob as she poured out his tea. ' I say Jacob, I wonder what took Mrs Brom ley to the concert last night, and him that ill ? ' ' The phaeton, I reckon.' ' Goodness ! What a man you are ! Do you think I should go gallivanting off to concerts if you was brought home ill ? ' ' May happen not. Concerts are not in your line.'

There were other observers besides Mrs Bryant who were ' surprised to see Mrs Bromley at the concert, when her husband was too ill to be present.' Others in more polite circles, and behind shopkeepers' counters, who ' thought it strange she should leave Mr Bromley when he was so ill.' And as this illness became more pronounced so did these fallacious opinions, until the tender-hearted little woman, who had only quitted her husband on his insistance that he ' wanted quiet,' and ' Miss Power must not be neglected, was privately censured as a thoughtless and indifferent wife."], [92, "CHAPTER VI. THE WATERS OF MARA H. It speedily rang through Highfield on the second day of the bazaar, when the patronesses were non est, that Lady Spencer had been taken ill in the concert-room, and that Miss Octavia had been compelled to drive home with her to Spenceburn Hall, leaving her stall at the bazaar to the care of Miss Saville. The news found Norman, along with the Curate, at the gate of the school-house, whither his restlessness had driven him, before he was due at the office, in the hope to exchange a few words with Octavia, on her way to her stall. She was late, he thought. Some of the ladies were already in the building. Up came Herbert Stanfield, with a flushed face and a note for the Curate, which he at once passed to his friend. It ran thus : \u2014 ' Miss Stanfield regrets extremely that she is compelled, much against her will, to relinquish her post So"], [93, "The Waters of ' Mar ah. 81 and accompany her sister, Lady Spencer, to Spenceburn Hall for an indefinite period. She trusts there will be no difficulty in filling her place at the stall.' ' This is really very awkward,' said the Rev. John ; ' we are short of saleswomen already. Mrs Bromley cannot leave her husband.' Then, turning to Herbert, without noting the silence of Norman, he said, remembering the reason assigned for quitting the concert-room, over night, ' This is sudden. Can Lady Spencer be so seriously ill ? ' ' She says so,' answered the young man, with a jerky lift of shoulders and of chin, as if per sonally doubtful. ' And I suppose it must be more than one of her fancies, the Pater and Sir John appeared so much put about. They were the only two visible when I got home with the Misses Lumley. The others were all upstairs \u2014 maids packing, I suppose. Bee never cares what an upset she makes. All I got out of Octavia this morning was that note, and the intimation that \"she should not go unless she thought it necessary.\" I know / thought, as they drove away, she was the paler of the two, and not best pleased.

' Family affairs are not for loud-voiced discussion in public' ' Really, Miss Sedgwick, you are right. Thank you for the reminder. I own I am like the Pater, rather outspoken ; and you know, Bee and I never did put up our horses together. But time is running fast as my tongue. Let us go inside. You ladies will have to fill up so many vacancies. Norman raised his hat, and said ' Good morning,' no one but the Curate observing how silent he had been. Yet not a word of that brief rose-tinted and perfumed note, or of the conversation, had escaped him. He was of Herbert's opinion, that Lady Spencer's ill ness was a sham, and yet more, a ruse to carry Octavia beyond his reach and influence. Still she was not one to be coerced, and she had said her departure 'was necessary.' How was he to interpret that, and her pallor. She had never much colour, unless animated, but she was not pale. He knew hoAV sarcastic Lady"], [95, "The Waters of Marah. 83 Spencer could be, and how she could sting her nobler sister with a word. It was torture to him to feel that, however inadvertently, he should have pointed shafts to wound her sensitive soul. At that same time that one Avord ' necessary,' coupled with her avowed unwillingness to go, implied \u2014 always presum ing the sudden illness a fiction \u2014 a conscious ness of some need to subdue natural warmth of feeling, if nothing more, at the bidding of family pride. The bare suggestion of such necessity was like a soothing balsam to a wound. ' Well, nephew Norman, you've not got a bad voice of your own, and you've learned how to manage it, as well as your fists,' was old Theobald's salutation to him as he entered the inner office, where Miss Selina had seen her brother comfortably ensconced before she left him. ' I am glad you think so. Not having sung in public before, I felt somewhat nervous.' ' Ugh ! You did not appear so. I thought you were decidedly self-sustained. You sang as if \"the lady-love you might not name\" was present.' It was impossible for Norman in the then"], [96, "84 The Slowly Grinding Mills. state of his feelings to keep the warm blood from rising to his forehead. 'Ah, well! I see,' continued the old fellow. ' No need to speak. Keep your secret, boy ; I don't want to pry. We all have our secrets, all of us \u2014 all of us,' and he chuckled at his own thought. Then, before Norman could reply, he broke out again, jocosely \u2014 ' I say, what a beau you were with a rose in your button-hole ! Was that a gift from \" Maud,\" or the lady-love un named ? ' Norman was on his guard at once. The Squire had surely been there. ' Nothing so romantic, uncle. It was an offering from Jeremiah Trench.' Theobald's face fell. ' Jeremiah Trench ! Why should he offer his choice flowers to you ? ' ' Really, uncle, I am not Trench's con fessor ; but he has been most civil to me ever since I was so lucky as to rescue his son-in-law from those savages. He has been more gracious to Saunders since then, and I have never been without flowers in my room.' Another growl was checked by a tap at the"], [97, "The Waters of Marah. 85 door, and the announcement \u2014 'Mr Langley, sir.' That meant business, much to Norman's relief. 'Anyone been here before Mr Langley?' Norman asked Jack Reid, when that fussy individual had departed. 'No, sir, the office was not opened until you came.' ' It was clear none of the Stanfields had prompted old Theobald's query anent the rose. It must be an accidental coincidence,' Norman argued, as he went through a sheaf of the morning's letters, annotating and flinging over the rail such as Jack was to answer. But he had no idea how he had left his queer uncle growling over that rose in his own den, or the game of cross-purposes they had been playing. Miss Sedgwick came home when the Bazaar closed at dusk. ' We're out in our reckoning, Theo,' said she, flinging her bonnet on the sofa with untoward negligence ; ' that rose did not come from the Rectory.' ' Ugh! So I've discovered.' ' Anything else ? '"], [98, "86 The Slowly Grinding Mills. 'Ay,' drily. 'It was Trench's love gift! ' Trench's, eh ? Who told you ? ' ' Norman.'

Miss Selina had been standing during this colloquy, confronting her seated brother, one stijl gloved hand resting upon the table as she bent forward, speaking with deliberate incisive ness, but low-pitched voice. ' Two roses ! ' echoed the old man, as if de liberating. ' Where ? ' ' Octavia wore one. She often does. Do you see the point ? ' Theobald's brow darkened. His lean hands gripped the arms of his chair. 'Stay, Theobald. It may be all chance. If not, and Lady Spencer is right, we are in the wrong, and may as well give in.

We shall only make mischief by interference.' ' Ugh ! Calf-love ! Wait till he goes to college. He's too hot-headed for my pet. And \u2014 don't you meddle. Take your things upstairs, and come back to a game of cribbage.' She took up her bonnet and retired, rolling up the strings mechanically as she went, gravely reflective. After a time she came back, with a face inflexible and inscrutable as her brother's. But they were henceforth on opposite sides. Nothing more was said of love or lovers, or match-making ; they pursued their game, and counted their 'fifteens' and their 'pairs' with stolid faces. But when Betty had brought in the supper-tray, and the game was over, she had one or two other items of news for him, the"], [100, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 88 only scraps worth repeating being that after everyone had given Mrs Bromley up of neces sity, she had put in her appearance at the Bazaar, as she said, ' at the joint request of Dr Elliott and her husband, who was distressed to see her anxiety.' Moreover, Mrs Bryant, the new organist who sang and played so delight fully at the concert, had proffered her services at the deserted refreshment-stall, and really made herself very useful. ' But I don't like her a bit the better for that. She is much too obliging and obsequious for a stranger,' was Miss Sedgwick's summing up. Would Miss Sedgwick have liked her any the better had she seen the letter that individual penned and posted after the concert, ostensibly to her friends in London, a letter which some how had found its way in the morning to Nicholas Bromley, Esq., along with his dainty breakfast, and mixed the very waters of Marah with his coffee and cream, with the warm bath prescribed by the doctor, and made him restless and uneasy in the presence of the loving little woman he called his wife.

It told him that he had been seen and recognised, and that all his schemes for wealth and position were at the mercy of a merciless woman. The very com pulsion to appear calm in the presence of his wife had but added to his mental \u2014 ay, and to his physical torture. For as she pitifully wiped the cold dew from his discoloured brow, he had clenched his down stretched hands under the cool coverlet until the long nails dug into the palms ; and, writhing in his efforts to suppress a groan, he had given his unaccommodating hip a twist that wrung from him a cry not to be suppressed, and from her, commiseration which only added to his torture. ' My dear Anna,' said he then with a gasp, ' you are a kind, loving little creature, but you do not understand that a man does not care for a woman to witness his weakness or his pain. It distresses me to see you so anxious. It would really relieve me if you would join Miss Power at the Bazaar.'"], [102, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 90 And so, after a little argument, she had obeyed, after leaving numberless instructions with cook and Dinah for their care of the sick man, and had joined Miss Power, only to add another leaf to Martha Pratt's volume of ' won derings,' a leaf to be quoted against the docile little lady at a future day. Weeks went by. The organ had been duly dedicated and the organist installed. Mr Bromley had emerged from his sick-room, and taken a turn or two round the terraced garden walks leaning on a stick and on the arm of his attentive wife. He had even been permitted an interview with Mr Langley, the Secretary of the new Gas Company, and a surveyor \u2014 relative to the plot of land to be leased ; and had furthermore been driven out by Thomas to take the air along the shaded Waterway, or by Bridge End almost to the gates of Spenceburn Park five miles away, but never farther up Church Street than Lawyer Sedgwick's or the Bank. In all those weeks no further demand for a settlement of the ' long outstanding account ' had been made, nor had he chanced to come across his dreaded correspondent in his drives. Possibly she had heard what a yellow-eyed,"], [103, "The Waters of Marah. 91 yellow-skinned wreck of a man he had become, and forbore to torment him further. Between Asaph and his mother, and the Curate, and even the organ-blower, she could not fail to hear, even without a question asked. He was the chief subject of gossip for the time being. Then Clarence ' had it out with him ' over the gift of the fossils to the Institute, but in a very mild way ; for, as he told Irene and Miss Preston, ' he looked such a poor, weak, miser able and shrunken wretch, and professed himself so unconscious of offence or any idea that I set any store by the things, that although I did not believe him, I felt I should be a brute to take a mean advantage of the sickly yellow-skinned wreck he has become.' The weeks lengthened out. Mr Bromley, still leaning on his gold-headed Malacca cane, still yellow and shrivelled, and with Thomas in close attendance, had made his way through the ' planting ' on to the wide patch of waste moor land which formed part of the Copeland estate ; and had there superintended the measuring and staking-out of the land for the gasworks, which he was leasing on a progressive rental, low in seeming, but to be a source of future revenue won from barren waste. He had calculated on"], [104, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 92 a need for extension, so that the plot agreed on would neither impinge on the railway, or to become an unsightly object in the rear of Moorside House, yet was not so far wide as to intrude on the cinder-path, or prevent the erection of workmen's dwellings in a parallel line with Back Lane. Indeed, the demand for such cottages, and likewise for a slightly better class of houses also to be raised on that idle waste, was part of his speculation. And, as he looked on, proud of his sagacity as a land owner, he lost sight of his ' long outstanding account ' for the time being. His creditor had not troubled him again ; Mrs Bryant was much away 'teaching' during the week days. He breathed freer. And nothing had been said or heard of Miss Octavia's probable return home. Herbert, in his ignorance, chafed at his sister's prolonged absence, declared the Manor House was insufferably dull without her, and Clarence, who could not be always at the Rec tory, was as much like a fish out of water as Herbert, until the Squire, to find occupation for the boys, took them off to the colliery to interest them in the new shaft and new work ings, as more educationally useful to them than"], [105, "The Waters of Marah. 93 popping at partridges or grouse with either himself or Sir John. But to no one was Octavia's prolonged ab sence so painful as to Norman Sedgwick. He felt like a culprit. The innocent cause of her banishment from home ; yet debarred by cir cumstances from exculpating himself and releas ing her. It occurred to him that the Squire, frequently at the office, was less cordial than of old, and that even his Uncle Theobald was stiff and constrained. His aunt, on the contrary, had never been more kind. ' Mr Norman,' said Irene to him one even ing, when, as usual, his uncle taxed his gallan try to escort his godchild home after tea, \u2014 ' Mr Norman, have you any idea why Octavia re mains so long at Spenceburn? As Herbert says, Lady Spencer is not so much in need of her as is her own dear mother, or \u2014 or any of us.' A suppressed sigh marked his personal assent to that, although he merely said he was ' not in the young lady's confidence.' 'Neither am I, this time,' echoed Irene; ' it is quite a mystery. And when I went to Spenceburn with aunt, she did look so pale, and Avent so red when I questioned her, and"], [106, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 94 told her I knew it was ' something about a rose,' and 'someone's impertinence' at the concert. You know I heard Lady Spencer was cross about the one she wore. I thought she would have plucked the flower out of Octavia's hair. I hate mysteries over nothing.' ' So do I, Miss Irene ; but when a dear friend evinces a desire to keep a little matter private, it is surely best to respect that privacy and help to maintain it. I think we may trust Miss Octavia to do nothing without a justifiable motive. And pardon me if I suggest that you should not mention this little incident of the rose to anyone again. You might cause your friend pain.' ' Oh, Mr Norman, I never thought of that. Thank you very much for your good advice. I will be cautious.' And then they shook hands at the Rectory gate, whilst Mrs Pratt stood on tiptoe, and flattened her nose against her kitchen windoAv, watching and wondering. He crossed the road, and entered his sitting room wondering too."], [107, "95 CHAPTER VII. TURNING THE TABLES. Norman not merely wondered, he resolved, and with him resolution meant action. He unlocked his writing desk, and the sub joined letter was delivered to Miss Stanfield the following day : \u2014 'Highfield, Sept. 15, 185 \u2014 . 'Dear Miss Stanfield, \u2014 Will you, of your own generous nature, pardon this intrusion, for I am between the horns of a dilemma, and must either risk the charge of impertinent free dom in thus addressing you, or submit to lie under the much graver imputation of conduct unworthy a gentleman.

Permit me to say in self-defence that the flower came into my hands unsought by myself, unknown, I am sure, to the lady, and that the song had been down upon the programme three weeks in advance of the concert. ' I do not write to offer an apology, since I was guiltless of intentional offence, but I desire to express my extreme regret that any act of mine should have led to such an inference, or caused you one moment's annoyance. The pain to me has been excessive, for I must have sunk very low in your estimation before you could have credited me with such a breach of hospitality and good manners. \u2014 Yours sin cerely, Norman Sedgwick.' The letter was found by Octavia with others on a slab in the entrance hall, on her return from a drive with her sister. Gathering up hers, she turned and swept up the broad stair case to her own room, with a loftier port than"], [109, "Turning the Tables. 97 ordinary, though there was a rosier flush upon her face than she had borrowed from moorland breezes. Pride possibly might be the painter, but pride has many aliases. Her maid was speedily dispensed with. She was impatient to learn on what grounds Nor man had written to her. His firm handwriting was sufficiently familiar. The long-absent roses on her cheeks took a deeper crimson as she read. The blood of shame suffused her neck and throat and tingled in her ears. ' So Beatrice has made a pretty piece of business for us all to edge out of \u2014 if we can \u2014 with her idiotic suspicions and fancies. What must he think of us, and our ready application of his song ? \u2014 the song sung over in our own drawing-room, and selected by my father him self for its chivalrous tone.

Octavia had been standing by her dressing table, letter in hand, thinking it over, never for one moment doubting the verity of the writer ; but as the thought swept across her mind that she had been placed in as false a position as Norman, she sank into a chair, casting her eyes aimlessly about the room, as if seeking an outlet for her own shame and distress. She felt as if her sister had put them all to needless pain, and sprang to her feet determined to bring her to task. Ere she reached the door her mood changed \u2014 ' No,' she reflected, ' I cannot disturb her at present, it would not be sisterly \u2014 I must wait. Should I show the letter to Sir John ? No, I might cause dis agreements between the pair, and that would never do. Shall I send the letter to the Squire ? No, it was addressed to me in all loyalty ; I must deal with it myself. There is not a word in it to which even Beatrice could take exception. The lawyer's clerk, as she styles him, has certainly not presumed beyond esteem. Ah, well, perhaps it is best.' But she sighed very heavily over the muttered thought."], [111, "Turning the Tables. 99 Writing materials were handy. Without allowing her purpose to cool, she dashed off the following answer : \u2014 'Spenceburn Hall, Saturday. 'Dear Sir, \u2014 It is not for you to apologise, but for those who have supposed you capable of an ungentleman-like act, and in their stead I hasten to do so. With your permission I will show your letter to the Squire. \u2014 Yours, Avith much regret, Octavia Stanfield.' 'Why, what in the name o' goodness has brought you down so early this Sunday morn ing, Mr Norman?' exclaimed Mrs Pratt, look ing up amazed from the breakfast cloth she was laying, and moving towards the window she had ' left open to settle the dust.' ' No, do not close it, the heat is so oppressive I have been unable to sleep for it.' And appar ently overpowered he threw himself down into an arm-chair by the open window, as if for the luxury of fresh air. He was not a lounger, and was fastidiously neat in his attire. It set his landlady ' wondering ' to see him sit there in his old house-coat in the sight of all the street. It was hot, but he was restless with uneasi-"], [112, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 100 ness and expectation, and he had the street in view. It was not the heat but his landlady's speculative eyes and tongue had driven him there so early \u2014 early enough to watch the post man toiling up the street with his full bag, and to take through the window a letter which else would have been handed to Martha Pratt at the door. ' Goodness ! what a smell o' roses ! ' ejaculated she as she carried in the breakfast tray, and sniffed the air whilst setting things in order \u2014 not the sort of order which had served for Mr Bromley. The rose-tinted and perfumed missive lay hid near a beating heart, until the breakfast was ready, and the window down for privacy over the meal. But there was such an aroma of roses hanging about Mr Norman after that, she came to the conclusion it was 'some scent he put on his hankercher.' In love, lawyers are but men. That brief note was like a reprieve to a criminal. Octavia was true to herself \u2014 and to him \u2014 he might have added, but he did not know it, and was not presumptuous. Back went his guarded reply without delay : \u2014 ' Dear Miss Stanfield, \u2014 You are at liberty"], [113, "Turning the Tables. 101 to use my letter in any way you think proper. I am proud to know that you absolve me. \u2014 Yours sincerely, 'Norman Sedgwick.' On the Tuesday forenoon Octavia Stanfield came cantering through Bridge End with a groom behind her, and took the people at the Manor House by surprise. Her still delicate mother received her with a glad cry and expanded arms, half rising to meet the warm emphatic embrace in which she was elapsed. 'I think,' said the daughter then, 'you, dearest mamma, require me by your side much more than Beatrice does. I am growing weary of her whims and fancies.' An uneasy expression crossed the mother's refined face. ' Yes, my dear,' she sighed, ' but you know \u2014 'True, my dear mamma, I do know, and that is why I am here. Bee has simply made us all ridiculous. I wish to see papa ; where is he ? ' ' Gone to a special meeting of the Gas Company. He will be home for luncheon.' 'Oh, that would be the meeting Sir John"], [114, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 102 desired to attend. But Beatrice was impera tive, insisted on one or both of us remaining with her. So, not being tied to her, / broke loose, and Sir John remains.' ' Really, Octavia dear, how could you \u2014 ' How could she ? How could Sir John ? you mean. Well, I thought it better to come away than to stay and quarrel with her. And as for Sir John \u2014 he will break loose one of these days, or he is not the man I take him for. But where is Herbert ? ' ' In his den, putting his things together. You know the boys go back to Rugby on Thursday.' ' Ah, so they do. I will go to him.' There was a glad meeting between brother and sister in that ' den ' where they had spent so many happy holiday hours together with Clarence and Irene as boys and girls, and where she still seemed quite at home among the cricket bats and balls, the single-sticks and foils, the guns and other sporting gear, where he was separating or putting in order things to be taken or left. They talked together of many things, mostly interesting to him, of any thing but that uppermost in her mind, of which Herbert knew nothing"], [115, "Turning the Tables. 103 Of Clarence he said, ' He is going on to the moor this afternoon with the Pater and a builder, who is to give estimates for putting up the other Copeland cottages. The Pater says the work-people the gasworks will bring here must be housed, and he is going to advance the money on mortgage rather than let the land lie idle to the end of Duke's minority.' So it appeared that the Squire had the coming workmen in view, as well as had Mr Bromley. Octavia, however, claimed the private ear of the Squire in advance. She laid Norman's letter before him. ' There papa, read that ! 1 1 is from the \" impertinent lawyer's clerk,\" whose \" scan dalous assumption \" sent me into exile lest I should \"disgrace my family,\" and throw myself and my money away upon him.' (Octavia would have a considerable property of her own when she came of age, \u2014 a legacy from an aunt.) The Squire's healthy face flushed hotly as he read. He was a staunch lover of truth and justice. 'Why, my girl,' said he, 'if this be true, we have done that fine young man a grievous"], [116, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 104 injustice. But how came he acquainted with this blunder of Bee's ? ' ' Oh, papa, Beatrice is not too guarded when she is out of temper. Irene overheard her when she so politely insisted on my quitting the concert hall, and made a snatch at my poor rose. Crowded behind that screen were other ears and eyes besides Irene's.' The Squire paced the floor, knitting his brows in perplexity. ' Still \u2014 how came he by the other rose, I should like to know? They are not common in Highfield?' he said tenta tively. ' I cannot say, unless Miss Preston gave it \u2014 or \u2014 or \u2014 do you think Trench was the offender ? ' Her black eyes suddedly expanded luminously. ' I do believe I saw two blooms on the tree that very morning, and Trench told me at night he brought me the very last.' ' That's soon ascertained.' 'Stay, papa,' she cried with a smile, block ing his way. ' You had better keep your appointment with the builder, and leave me to look up Trench among his flowers. If there be anything to learn I will get at it without setting him thinking. Besides, I must ask about Nelly.'"], [117, "Turning the Tables. 105 'Ah, he'll talk fast enough about her now he is a grandfather. There might never have been a boy in creation before.' So Octavia discovered, when she sought the old man out to congratulate him, and make him the bearer of a gift and kind message to his daughter. And she contrived, during their tour of inspection round the glass-houses, to be suddenly reminded of something. ' Oh, Trench, you said you brought me the last of my China-roses. I fancied I had seen two on the tree in the morning.' ' Ye-es, Miss ; but I gave the other to young Mr Sedgwick. I thought you would not mind, Miss. My Nelly might have been left a widow but for him. And you know there's no garden either at the lawyer's or Pratt's. I have taken the liberty to gi\\'e the gentleman a few flowers now and then. It's all I can do to show I don't forget. I know as the Squire would not mind.' About half-an-hour before luncheon that day, when the gas meeting had broken up, Clarence Copeland had chanced to stand at the work man's bench in front of the window of his sanctum, immediately above that of the library. He was sorting and arranging the original architect's plans and calculations for the Cope"], [118, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 106 land cottages, which had been given into his charge by his dying father, along with the large brass-bound writing-desk in which they were contained. Holding the drawings and papers on edge to shake them to a level, he happened to raise his eyes and look out. To his surprise, far doAvn the wood-path, where it met the rugged descent between the two white gates, so disastrous to aspiring Mr Bromley, he beheld that personage in earnest conversation with a woman in black whose face was concealed by a thick veil, as well as by the sombre shadow of the darksome firs. ' Hillo ! Who's that laying down the law to my stepfather? It's someone he's afraid of; he shrinks back as if he thought she would strike him. Shouldn't wonder if she was some one he had served a dirty trick in his clerk ship, and she's rounding on him now. And she seems to have got the whip-hand of the miserable craven. This illness hasn't left him the pluck of a sparrow. But I must wrap up my papers, and have a wash, or I shall be late.'

What would they have thought could they have looked below the skin for the causes which had produced such visible effects ? ' He was recovering slowly, but was still very weak,' he said. Consequently, nothing could be more natural than for him to pass out of the New Inn by the side door in Cross Street when the meeting broke up, and take the short cut home over the cinder-path, seeing that Thomas was not there with the phaeton.

'Thank goodness I've got safe so far,' said he, half aloud, as he opened the little white gate, and proceeded with cautious footsteps and the aid of his gold-headed cane to make the descent under the trees from level to level, until he could turn into the slightly-winding path ending at the French window of the library. He had taken the turn, felt his footing more and more sure, looked up, and staggered back with a cry against the red bole of a Scotch fir. The black shape he had dreaded was there.

And knowing nothing of Norman's private circumstances, or of his secret devotion to another shrine, he almost envied him the years which made him eligible either to propose or to marry. And he might have envied him the thick fall of brown hair which nearly met beneath his chin, adding so much to his manliness, had not his own chestnut crop pro-"], [130, "118 The Slowly Grinding Mills. mised fairly well. He was not naturally envious, he had no dread of her intimacy with Herbert, or Mr Saville, or any of the young fellows she came in contact with at the Manor House, and he took himself to task for his unaccountable fear of Norman as a rival. But as the day drew near for another parting, with nothing decided, he dwelt upon possibilities more than was com fortable. His business with the Squire and the builder had run away with much of the afternoon, but no sooner had the three shaken hands at the Manor House gate, than he sped towards the Rectory like an arrow towards a mark, Negro bounding along in advance, as if pretty sure of their destination. Whilst the builder had been re-measuring the land as defined in the original plans, under the furtive inspection of Mrs Gill and Nelly Saunders, who carried in her arms a living excuse for loitering, and he was left pretty much to his own thoughts, it suddenly dawned upon him that it was dishonourable to leave Irene, term after term, fettered by secret bonds which no one ratified, and which not even they had called an engagement. The Rectory door stood open, and the Rector"], [131, "The Meeting in the Wood. 119 was crossing the hall to the tea-room as Clarence set foot on the broad step. As the two clasped hands the latter said im pulsively, \u2014 ' I want to speak with you, after tea, Mr Preston, if you can spare me half-an-hour.' ' Certainly, my boy. What about ? Any thing particular ? ' 'Yes, sir, most particular, Irene! The Rector lifted his eyebrows, looked into the anxious face of Clarence, with a broad smile upon his own, nodded, and said, \u2014 'Ah, that's it, is it ! Well, after tea,' and led the way into the presence of his sister and daughters, as serenely as if the question had been settled in his own mind long before. Negro had already poked his nose into the room, and the deepened rose-tint on Irene's cheek was, perhaps, unnoticed as she bent down to pat the dog's glossy black head. The Rector's few words had been decidedly non-committal, and though the younger man talked about the afternoon's business, and Irene of an unexpected visit from Octavia, and the others of his return to Rugby, he was not altogether at his ease, so that Irene, know ing nothing of the impending conference, was"], [132, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 120 afraid of some unpleasantness between him and the stepfather who continued in such ill odour alike with her father and godfather. Her perplexity increased when her father rose from the table saying, ' Now, Clarence,' and the latter followed, merely asking her to take care of Negro for a while. ' Aunt, have you any idea what is the matter ? ' she asked, tremulously, as she put her foot into her netting-stirrup, to resume a nearly finished purse for Clarence. ' No, my dear, if you have not. Possibly he wants advice about his studies.' But motherly Miss Preston had her own thoughts. ' Well, Clarence,' began the Rector, when they were closeted in his extremely cosy sanctum, where every chair seemed to invite repose rather than studious meditation ; well, what about Irene?' Impulsive Clarence, thus tackled, did not find speech as fluent as when he ran full butt against his interlocutor in the hall, but without over much stumbling he gave the Rector fully to understand what he meant. ' Are you certain that the devotion you profess is reciprocal ? ' he was asked, dubi ously."], [133, "l he Meeting in the Wood. 121 ' Quite. You must know we have loved each other since we were children.' ' Yes, yes, yes, no doubt. But that is a very different feeling from the love which has to stand the test of time, the rubs and jolts of married life.' ' I think, sir, it is a very secure foundation to build upon. There could be no rude awaken ing to unsuspected tempers.' ' Well, well, perhaps not. But you are both so young. And a \u2014 a \u2014 circumstances have changed of late.' Clarence flushed. He thought the Rector, leaning back in his chair and looking full at him, might have spared him that thrust. ' Of course, I know we are young, but our attachment is not, and if I have lost the estate I was supposed to inherit, the colliery partner ship remains. And I ask your consent to our immediate engagement and correspondence, not to our marriage until I am of legal age, and come fully into my rights.' ' Yes, yes, that's all very well. But it is not altogether money I am thinking about. Irene's own fortune would place you \u2014 ' ' I did not know she had any fortune,' inter rupted Clarence in very genuine surprise."], [134, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 122 ' Yes, yes, of course from her mother's settle ments \u2014 but it was not that so much as my darling's happiness I had to consider.

' Well, he tells me that you would be willing to leave your home, your aunt, and your doting father, all for the love of him.' A crimsoned face was buried in his capacious neckcloth, a pair of soft arms hugged him close. ' Oh, papa, dear papa, not just yet. But I do love him dearly, very dearly,' she whis pered. ' There Clarence, you have your answer,' said the Rector, kissing the girl's forehead and handing her over to him.

STARTLING DISCLOSURES. \u2022 So your pretty godchild has made her elec tion, and the Rector has confirmed it,' observed Squire Stanfield to Theobald Sedgwick, when he called at the lawyer's office on his way home from the railway station after ' seeing the boys off by the morning train.' ' We all saw whither the pair was drifting, there was no doubt about them, but I must confess we were dubious how Mr Preston might take it, he has been so bitter over the widow's re-marriage.' Grasping the arms of his chair with his long hands, and sitting bolt upright, the old lawyer stared the speaker full in the face, as if lacking comprehension. ' What are you talking about, Squire ? What do you mean ? ' he asked, in his hardest tones. ' Why, don't you know ? Irene Preston is engaged to Clarence Copeland.' ' What !

Young as they both are, people had begun to couple their names together ; and that would soon have become unpleasant. Besides, the an nouncement will serve to keep off poachers.' ' Poachers, indeed ! ' interjected the grim lawyer under his breath. ' The Rector would not think them so young as you may,' went on the Squire ; ' he is called upon to marry such mere boys and girls from the colliery every year. Then theirs is likely to be a long engagement. Still their attachment has grown with their growth, and to my mind will stand the strain. And I don't see what objection you can have. Clarence is a fine young fellow in every way.' ' Ugh ! not see any objection ! Has not the boy lost his birthright ? Does not a usurper hold the Copeland estate \u2014 every acre ?

Irene will be content, I know,' pursued the Squire. 'Ugh-h!' growled Theobald, 'but I shall not. I had hoped to see my Blossom at the head of an old ancestral home, with a man for her husband, not a stripling.' ' Clarence will be man enough by the time he is of age to marry.' said the Squire drily, taking up his hat to depart. He was stayed by an abrupt query from the irritated old man. ' Look you, Squire, Irene is my godchild. I have regarded and treated her almost as my \u2022own, and have taken care she should not go empty-handed to a husband provided she married to my liking. She has upset all my cherished plans. How would you like your daughter to serve you the same ? ' This was a home-thrust. ' Ah, we-11,' replied the Squire with deliberation \u2014 ' I don't think I have formed any plans for Octavia. She would very likely Avipe them out if I did. You know she will be her own mistress at twenty-one. We can only rely on her clear head and inborn pride to preserve her from a misalliance! With that the Squire took his departure, going away, not through the outer office, but through the private door into the hall. Theo-"], [139, "Startling Disclosures. 127 bald Sedgwick's unexpected question had set something tapping smartly at his breast, as if it had been \u2014 ' The Avoodpecker tapping the hollow beech tree,' disinclining him to make the apology to Theo bald's nephew, which he nevertheless had felt to be due, ever since Trench's admission. As it happened Norman at that moment crossed the hall with some papers for his Aunt Selina to copy. Naturally he stopped short to shake hands with the Squire, and ask after ' the ladies.' He could not trust himself to particularise. Indeed both appeared uncommonly awkward, Norman none the less because of the blunder ing apology Mr Stanfield felt constrained to make ; a constraint which took much of the grace out of it. The younger man recovered himself first. ' Say no more, Mr Stanfield. We will let the unpleasant subject rest. I am content to know that I am exonerated from a suspicion of con duct unbecoming a gentleman,' he said, with sufficient dignity. ' Egad, the young fellow had the best of it,' murmured the Squire, as he stepped into his"], [140, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 128 waiting carriage. ' There was more than a touch of latent Sedgwick pride in that reply of his. But what \"ancestral home\" had the queer old lawyer in his mind for Irene? Caroline will laugh when I tell her of his over turned castle. Um-m, surely it was not the Manor House he meant. Did he imagine Herbert was sweet on the girl? I know of no other \"ancestral home,\" with an unmarried heir likely to fall at her feet \u2014 and he \u2014 pooh, Bert has more sense than to think of any girl for years to come.' (If the Squire could have heard his son's idiotic raving over Clara Saville in confidential exchange with Clarence in the privacy of the rail way carriage, he would have been less assured.) Meanwhile Theobald's bell had rung impera tively for Norman. ' Were you cognisant of Irene Preston's en gagement to Clarence Copeland ? ' he asked abruptly, fixing his stern grey eyes on the other's face as if he would look into his soul. ' No, indeed ! But I am glad to hear of it. I guessed how it would be, long ago. They were both so transparent. I wish them much happiness.' ' Then I don't ! And I did not expect you"], [141, "Startling Disclosures. 129 would. Where have your eyes been that you could not see my earnest desire to graft Blossom on our family tree. Surely she was as sweet a posy as any man could hope to gather,' jerked out his scowling uncle, snappishly. ' Very sweet and very charming, I confess, but so undoubtedly Mr Clarence Copeland's property from the first hour I beheld her in this office, that had she been thrice as sweet I should have forborne to put in a claim. Be sides, uncle, you well know my present posi tion quite shuts me out of the matrimonial market,' he replied, soberly enough. ' I know you have flung away a chance of fortune. That's what I know ! ' was the testy rejoinder. ' Better fling away fortune than honour and self-respect,' returned Norman, proudly. ' But there is no call for heroics where was no temptation.' ' Just so ! You can go ! ' and with a curt nod Norman was dismissed to cogitations on his own unsatisfactory position. In the household room, where Miss Selina's copying was prematurely disturbed by her brother's entrance, there was a much sharper encounter of opinions and wills. It was some- VOL.

She smilingly professed her satisfaction at the engagement, and trusted that it might run to a felicitious end. And' she reminded him that as she had declared her foreknowledge in the bazaar week, he had no reason to express surprise. He, growling like a bear, prowled about the room, or so much as the centre-table left to him, his arms hugging his own chest (where lay secrets unshared even with his sister), from time to time throwing irritable interjections at her across the crimson cloth, which she took with as much apparent composure as if they had been roses hurled at a rock. Possibly the stone was soft and the thorns sharp, for the close-shut lips opened and spake at length, and he stood stock-still in sheer astonishment.

Why should you usurp the right of Deity and work in the dark to a concealed end of your own, even if you mean it for their ulti mate advantage, seeing that you are a finite"], [143, "Startling Disclosures. 131 being and liable to err ? Did you bring Norman here merely to thwart two happy lovers, and burden him with an unsuitable companion for life ? Be thankful that you have a nephew of stronger calibre than to be led astray by a pretty face and artless, clinging ways.

Let him steer clear, or he may come to grief. What I brought him here for is my concern. If he had only put up to Blossom, I'd have been the making of him. He has disappointed me!

But you had better think twice before you blot the honest record of a life, merely because you find human hearts are not in your keeping. Break faith with Norman and I break faith with you.' ' Ah-h ! and bind the lad firmer to me ? ' he sneered. ' Sister Selina, I have not given all my keys into your keeping. I do not take counsel always with a woman.' With that he turned on his heel, half chuckl ing, as he went back to his own office, where he composed himself with the reflection, \u2014 ' En gagement is not marriage. We shall see, we shall see.' Legal subtleties superseded private chat at the dinner-table. But no sooner was the cloth withdrawn than away went Miss Selina ; and, as Norman took his accustomed seat at his desk, he saw her marching up the street, erect and stiff as her inflexible purpose. She Avas bent on guarding Irene against her"], [145, "Startling Disclosures. 133 godfather's displeasure, with the assurance that he only thought she was too young ; and the double assurance that all her other friends were certain to approve and wish them well. ' So, take courage, dear, and don't be down hearted if you find your godpapa cross,' she said, as she shook hands with Miss Preston, and responded warmly to Irene's demonstra tive embrace at parting. Theobald himself had considerably toned down before he took his way to the Rectory, and found his pet so proud and happy he had not the heart to damp her joy with strong disapprobation. Yet he did give the Rector a hint that he considered the engagement pre mature, and thought she might have made a much better match had they not been so precipitate. Octavia's congratulations came by the same post as Irene's first absolute love-letter, and filled her cup of happiness to the brim. It was so delicious to know that everyone had re garded their engagement as a foregone con clusion- \u2014 even the old people who thought both Clarence and herself ' rather young.' With her blushing honours still thick upon her, she paid her visit to the Manor House to"], [146, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 134 cheer Mrs Stanfield in the absence of Octavia, glad enough to escape the callers at the Rec tory, and be at liberty to dream of her Clarence undisturbed ; though she was not much of a day-dreamer, and proved a most desirable com panion to the semi-invalid, seeming to know by intuition Avhen book or conversation or music Avould become wearisome. When the unaccustomed quietude of the large house became oppressive, off went Irene for a stroll \u2014 not into the lonely grounds, but up the village to the Rectory or her godfather's, or away down the lane to look in on Nelly Saunders and her baby. But she did not go that way a second time, she felt so dreadfully the interdict on a call at Moorside House. She did not mind crossing to the white gate and the planting on a short expedition, via the cinder-path to Bank View \u2014 not, perhaps, with out a hope of meeting Mrs Bromley at the Savilles' ; it appeared so unnatural not to be able to exchange a line or a word with her in their new relations. Surely enough, on the second of those visits, she did find the mother of Clarence sitting with Clara Saville, and was not a little overpowered by her old friend's emotional outburst, so much"], [147, "Startling Disclosures. 135 in excess of anything she could have anticipated. She was received with effusion, embraced, wept over, fondled more like a petted kitten than the 'dear daughter' her son was to give her. In deed, Mrs Bromley's manner was so strange and so hysterical that Irene was rather glad than otherwise when the interview was over, and she could hasten back, leaving her still at the Curate's. In fact, she quite forgot to mention, as an incident of her walk thither, that when ascend ing the steep bank of the planting she had been surprised to see the figure of a tall woman in black at the far end of the wood-path, and nearing the library window ; whilst Negro was barking his very loudest, as if he scented an intruder. She thought of it as she went back, for Negro was still unquiet ; and, singularly enough, the same black figure, so shawled and veiled as to seem a mere mass of gliding drapery, was coming along the pathway towards her in the dusky twilight of the trees and of the afternoon. She had never seen a stranger on that path before, and this was so peculiar that, without an atom of superstition, she felt a creepy sensa tion come over her, and made her own exit"], [148, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 136 as speedily as the rugged descent would permit. She said nothing of this at the Manor House, but her next letter to Clarence was full of her meeting with his mother, and of the strange black figure she had seen in the planting. Her letter recalled to his memory the woman in black he had seen confronting his stepfather, and set him speculating whether this would be the same, and what could be her business there. For his mother's hysterical reception of Irene he was altogether at a loss to account. She had certainly shed a few glad tears when he made his new engagement known to her before he left home, but not more than any emotional mother might have done on the eve of parting with her son. And he had accredited an extra glass of wine at dinner even with that. Possibly there had been some little unpleasantness with Mr Bromley over money matters, and the sight of Irene had overpowered her with recollections of the changes her own imprudent marriage had brought about. It was not altogether tran quilising, but it was the only solution he could find, and that he did not offer to Irene.

Norman had certainly introduced fresh clients in connection with the Gas Company, which he alone could not well have undertaken, and had acted for him, being duly qualified, where a mere clerk could not have done. And were he to throw up his post in disgust, there would be an end to all his plans indeed. Nay, there was no knowing what Selina might do. She might furnish the means to establish her nephew in a practice of his own, she could never contemplate making a fresh home with \u2014 He could not add another word even in his thoughts. That would be indeed breaking faith. (Yet that was precisely what she had contemplated in case he broke faith with the nephew of whom she was so proud.) However, Normah heard no more of the ' fortune he had thrown away,' and if his uncle was more than usually grumpy for a few days, that too wore off. But October burned itself out, and nothing had been said of partnership. He had begun seriously to debate within"], [150, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 138 himself whether he had done wisely to bury himself in a country lawyer's office as a mere clerk, or even a joint-partner, where those by birth his social equals would look down upon him ; instead of remaining to fight for position in the open arena of the Metropolis. He was not sure that his ultra-chivalrous motives were not misinterpreted. Then his anomalous posi tion with regard to Octavia Stanfield preyed on his mind, and suggested that only in absence lay a cure for his infatuation. To this a sting of another kind added a goad to drive him thence, little suspected by aunt or uncle. It so happened that one evening towards the close of October, he sat alone with his thoughts, his fingers straying dreamily over the keys of his piano, whilst his mind was straying away to the unattainable Octavia at Spenceburn, when a tap at his door, thrice repeated, roused him from his reverie. In answer to his ' Come in !

What a coincidence ! and now I recollect, the same name was written upon the song you obliged me with for use at the concert ? ' He bowed in assent. ' Dear me ! You are a Londoner, I believe ? ' Yes, madam.' 'And Mrs Sedgwick gave music-lessons, if I mistake not ? \" This time his eyes travelled inquiringly to Mrs Bryant's face, as he assented.

I hope I have not said anything to wound you. You see, when people go through what I have done, they grow callous, and forget how sensitive others may be.

The breakfast-table had been cleared, and they were seated on each side a fire as bright as their own faces. ' Why, here he comes,' cried Theobald ; ' you are just in time for the settlement of our private business before the office opens, my boy. Bring your chair to the fire.

But unless you are dissatisfied with Highfield, and the people in it, you had better listen to my proposals. There, there, don't say another word about dishonour, and all that.

The clear-eyed, tall young man, so like, yet so unlike his hard-featured relatives, looked from one to the other in utter bewilderment. He sat down as if unconscious of the move ment. His uncle was saying, 'Well, my boy, I regret that anyone should have raked into the old dung-heap to offend your sensitive nerves. But depend upon it if old Theobald endorses you as his partner, not a creature in Highfield, or near it, will dare wag a finger against you. \u2014 Selina, will you give Jack the keys whilst we come to an understanding.' The keys were taken, and the hint. The proposals were most liberal. Theobald balanced his nephew's young blood, energy, and modern experience, against his old practice and capital, and struck a balance extremely favourable to the other.

Here are the church bells ringing like mad because a son and heir is born to the Spencers, and now it seems her ladyship can no longer sneer at Norman Sedgwick as a \"mere lawyer's clerk.\" I suppose the next surprise will be to find Octavia at home. The old dowager is certain to be at Spenceburn in high feather, and the two will as certainly come to logger heads.' Other surprises there were, but they awaited Clarence, not Herbert. Not at the Rectory. And not on his Avay through the village. He scarcely saw the new brass-plate, so full was he of his ecstatic reception by his own sweet and loving Irene, who had grown so much more lovely and womanly in his absence, whilst Miss Preston and the Rector had been cordiality itself. He returned passing salutations in a sort of blissful dream, and it was not until he neared his own home that something came over"], [160, "148 The Slowly Grinding Mills. him of a chill \u2014 not referable to the atmosphere or the wintry aspect of the Squire's roadside shrubbery, where the bare branches held in sus pense the rain-drops of a recent downfall, or the tearful tribute from their own overhanging firs \u2014 but he shivered involuntarily, and though a faint clinking and clanking as of hammers upon iron came to him through the wood from work men beyond erecting the gasometor of the new works ; it only served to intensify the stillness and silence of the lane. He had passed the white gate, yet there came no welcoming bark from ' Negro.' Pos sibly the damp ground deadened the sound of his footsteps. Yet a pitman who had come under the railway arch neared, nay, passed the stable-yard, and still the good dog made no sign \u2014 it was strange. The advancing pitman turned out to be Ben Saunders, who, with all due respect, met his young landlord with a passing salutation, \u2014 ' Guid day, Maister Coupland, an' welcome hame.

Nelly will be amaist proud as of her ain bonnie laddie. I'll just gang back an' tell her. Guid day, sir,' and smiling he turned back. ' Good day, Ben, I shall be coming your way, and may look in on your wife and boy,' cried Clarence, running up the steps, and thinking, as he bent his head back, what a contented and honest face the Scotchman had, and how little occasion there had been for Trench to oppose his marriage with Nellie. He knocked imperatively at the door, as much in surprise to find no one on the watch for his coming, as at the unaccountable silence of his dog-. O Dinah, dapper and trim as of old, admitted him, but there was a constraint about her cus tomary ' Welcome home, sir,' or he fancied so. Mr Bromley, sickly-skinned, but less strongly saffron-tinted than when his stepson had left, advanced from the library door with extended hand, and a smile showing all his teeth, \u2014 ' Good afternoon, Clarence,' said he ; ' 'we are proud of your success.' ' Good afternoon. I hope I see you better,'"], [162, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 150 responded the young man, adding in a tone of surprise as he stripped off his overcoat, ' But where is my mother ? ' Mr Bromley dropped his voice. ' You will find her in the morning-room ; but \u2014 a \u2014 the fact is, \u2014 the news of your success rather overpowered her, and \u2014 a \u2014 she took a little too much wine with her luncheon.' ' Too much wine ? ' echoed Clarence, drawing himself up as if to resent the foul aspersion. ' My mother ! Impossible ! ' Hurrying past Mr Bromley he darted into the back room. His mother rose from her chair as if to meet him ; but her manner was hazy, and as her son advanced to clasp her, she threw her arms around his neck and welcomed him with hysterical sobbing, and gasping effu sion, for which he was totally unprepared. ' Oh ! my dear \u2014 dear boy ! My dear \u2014 Clar ence \u2014 I am \u2014 so glad to \u2014 have you \u2014 back again,' she sobbed in broken gasps, as she clung to him unsteadily. ' My dear mother, do not excite yourself. Are you not well ? ' he said, endeavouring to soothe her apparent agitation, his own pertur bation manifest.

Clarence was bewildered and distressed. Was this really the effect of wine, or was there some trouble in the background of which her letters had given no hint ? All at once Irene's letter flashed across his mind, and filled him with uneasy fears lest this should be more than a temporary weakness. And then he remem bered that in a vague way he had at times fancied his mother took more wine since her re marriage than in his father's days, but nothing more than he had seen other ladies take at table, when there had been no perceptible ill effects. Thinking this, as he endeavoured to calm her agitation, he heard a strange voice saying, as if to Mr Bromley, ' Do you think Mr Cope land would like any refreshment after his journey ? ' and turning his head to ascertain what new servant had been added to the estab lishment, he beheld, to his amazement, the tall figure of Mrs Bryant, the organist, as it were framed in the doorway, black as night except for her ruddy crown. 'Thank you, I have had luncheon,' he an swered, turning round, and glancing from her"], [164, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 152 to Mr Bromley as if to say, ' What may this mean ? ' She closed the door and disappeared. Mr Bromley, taking a seat with his back to the window, and twiddling nervously with his waistcoat buttons, did his best to answer the question he read in his stepson's eyes. With a heavy sigh, as preface, he began, \u2014 ' You are surprised, no doubt, to find another inmate under our roof, but \u2014 ' (another sigh) ' I found our housekeeping matters getting into confusion, the servants growing wasteful and impertinent, presuming on your mother's good nature and \u2014 a \u2014 weakness ' \u2014 (another sigh for emphasis) ' which, in a great measure, I attri bute to depression on her isolation from feminine society \u2014 and I Avas at my wits' end how to remedy the evil, when chance threw Mrs Bry ant in my way. I \u2014 I \u2014 had known her in London before she lost her husband \u2014 and \u2014 I was induced to invite her hither as a cheerful companion to Mrs Bromley, and at the same time to superintend the household, and check the lavish expenditure.' Clarence still retained the hand of his mother, though she had sunk back into her chair, and he felt it tremble in his clasp."], [165, "Changes. 153 ' This is a very singular story,' said he. ' I never knew my mother to be incapable of man aging her household, and I presume the ex penditure was in proportion to the income. There could be no necessity for cheese-paring ; or for the introduction of a housekeeper, in my opinion. As for my mother's present condition, there may be other causes for her agitation than the one assigned \u2014 ' ' Clarence had drawn himself up to his full height, his eyes lit up, his nostrils in a quiver as he stood there to defend his trembling mother from he hardly knew what. Mr Bromley, meanwhile, alternately biting the back of his thumb nail, and dislocating his buttons. Then a sinister light shot into his grey-green eyes, and his covered lips left his big teeth bare, as he put the question, \u2014 ' Did your mother ever tell you how she and I became intimate ?' ' Never,' said Clarence, opening wide his eyes. ' The lady was in tribulation over the bewil dering accounts of her tradespeople, and her inability to check them or to deal with dilatory tenants, and sighed for a man of business to take the helm.

A choking sob was the only response from the fireside-chair. Clarence glanced from one to the other, unable to reconcile this statement with his knowledge of his mother in the past. Yet one by one came back to him the odd ad missions his mother had made in her letters, the wail over her loneliness, and Mr Bromley's kind and clever adjustment of her perplexing business affairs. Had he really not known his mother's failings and incapacity, or was his step father hoodwinking both ? His breast heaved, his breath came hard through panting nostrils. 'Mother,' said he, 'can you not repel this vile slander ? ' There was nothing but a choking sob and a shudder in reply. ' \" That is no slander which is truth.\" Silence is confirmation. And now, young sir,' said Mr Bromley, rising with an air of injured integrity, ' I will leave you with your mother. But were I you, I should advise her to lie down and sleep it off.

' Mother,' whispered Clarence, when they were left to themselves, bending low to catch her answer, ' Is that man speaking truth ? ' 'I \u2014 I \u2014 don't know, my boy. I \u2014 seem to forget. I never used to be like this. I \u2014 I'm so sleepy.' There was a couch in the room. He led her to it, placed cushions under her head, and covered her with a rug. In less than a minute she was asleep. Then he seated himself on a chair by her side, as if to watch and guard her as she slept, leaning his head on his hand to think it all over. He was still incredulous. There was something about it all he could not realise. He had barely been away three months. Surely a habit so pro nounced was not acquired in so short a time ; and yet \u2014 and yet \u2014 had he not thought her manner peculiar on the second evening after the bazaar ?

He sat there in silent perturbation three parts of an hour. His mother was still asleep. He closed the door behind him and crossed the kitchen on the way to the stable-yard. Only the cook was there, a woman who had been in the family before he was born. His ' How are you, Sally?' and her response had not the ring of the old-time welcomes ; and she added in a lower voice, as if afraid of listeners, \u2014 ' Hegh ! it's a dowly home-coming for you, Maister Clarence ; but you must take heart.

How dare I \u2014 ' ' What right had you to destroy my dog ? ' ' What right had you to leave a savage beast on my premises ? ' ' Your premises ? ' echoed Clarence, with angry scorn. Yes, my premises, sir. And I command you to leave this room until you can control your temper. Remember I stand to you in loco parentis, and I am as little disposed to tolerate a savage stepson as a savage dog.' He half rose from his feet and grasped a ready ruler, expecting, from the hard gripping of his stepson's hands, the angry light in his eyes, the working of his features, and the sudden clenching of his teeth, that he was about to make an onslaught upon him."], [171, "Changes. 159 A moment's pause. The eyes of Clarence fell upon the ruler. In another instant he had turned, dashed from the room and out of the house, clashing the great door behind him.' ' Ah,' said the usurper, with a sneer and a feeling of relief, ' the boy's but a coward after all. He caved in when he saw the ruler.' Irene Preston had given that ruler to Clar ence Copeland's own father as a birthday gift. Its associations of love and reverence stayed the young man's hand, not any fear of the weapon, or the coward who grasped it. The jubilant bells rang sadly in dissonance Avith his altered mood as he hurried blindly up the steep hill, hardly conscious whither his steps were bent. He was in a fever of excite ment ; his mind in a whirl of confusion. This world might have been upside down. All he had most cherished was slipping from him. A gusty wind, which seemed to drive him forward, tossed his long hair about, and pelted his back with a sharp shower, of which he took no heed. Far up the hill he was brought to a stand by the cheery voice of the Squire, fresh from Spenceburn, who, topcoated and booted to meet the weather, spread out his arms as if to block the path."], [172, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 160 ' Heyday, Clarence ! where are you off to in such a hurry, and without an overcoat or umbrella? Does Rugby training make you wind and water proof?' 'Almost, sir,' he answered, with a faint attempt at a smile. ' But I really did not miss my overcoat. I have been much disturbed.' ' So I observe,' said the Squire, placing his arm Avithin that of the young man, ' or you would not be for scurrying past the Manor House on the first day of your return. Come home with me, and let us hear what is troubling you. Between us, Mrs Stanfield and I, may help to set things right.' That was more than they could do, however kindly disposed, for rumour had forestalled him in the guise of Miss Saville's simple maid, Susan, who had succumbed to the poke-nose proclivities of wondering Mrs Pratt, and had very nearly lost her situation for her indiscretion. From her lodger's convenient back bedroom window Mrs Pratt had observed the Curate and his sister, who carried a lantern, lead a female figure from Bank View across the waste to the white gate of the wood, which they entered.

So it was that in disburdening his overloaded mind to his trusty friends, poor Clarence only confirmed and accentuated a belies current in Highfield that Mrs Bromley drank to excess. Mrs Stanfield had said nothing to Irene when the original story came to her ears, but, unable and unwilling to give it credence, she had as delicately as possible questioned Miss Saville, and even from her unexaggerated statement, was reluctantly compelled to admit a foundation for the rumour. All the motherly instincts of the kind hearted gentlewoman were aroused by the evi dent pain of Clarence in making his revela tion of that day's discoveries. With infinite tenderness she laid her thin, white hand upon his arm as he sat beside her invalid chair, and said, \u2014"], [175, "An Evil Dream. 163 ' I fear, my dear boy, the case is beyond interference from us. The habit may have been growing insidiously in your absence from home, and possibly supplies a reason for your mother's marriage with a man so far beneath her.' (Clarence had not said a word of Mr Bromley's insinuations.) 'All you can do now is to keep a watch over her, and guard her from herself, or from irritating causes. You see, if her nervous system is out of order, a little wine may produce the effect of much on a stronger person.' > ' Yes,' struck in the Squire, ' and you must keep a guard upon yourself, since it is quite within credence that Mr Bromley has engaged Mrs Bryant altogether of necessity, as she ex plained to the Curate when arranging for the fulfilment of her duties as organist, as hitherto. It is very sad for us to speak to our old friend's son in this way, but it is better, my boy, that you hear it from us in kindness than from un reflecting strangers. Opinions in the town are somewhat divided, but considerable sympathy has gone out to Mr Bromley.' ' I should think no one in his senses would agree with the slaughter of the dog,' blurted out Herbert, who was present."], [176, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 164 'We-11,' said his father, 'you could not expect any man to keep a savage animal about his place to prevent him entering his own stables. And Negro, I am told, had grown extremely ferocious.' ' Would you grow very amiable, father, if you were chained up all day long in the dark ? ' questioned Herbert. ' We-11, perhaps not.' 'Never mind, Bert,' interposed Clarence, disconsolately, ' the dog becomes a secondary consideration in the face of the greater trouble. I feel crushed beneath the blow. I have always been so proud of my darling mother.' He buried his face in his hands as he spoke, and big tears, he could not repress, rolled down between his fingers. Mrs Bromley was quite herself the next day, and the next, but might have slept away all recollection of her condition or of unpleasant ness attending her son's arrival. Indeed, she asked him when he came, and apologised for not being awake to receive him. She took at meals the same wine as of old, and with no visible effect, beyond a little ex hilaration ; but he saw that she eyed Mrs Bryant with disfavour, although too timid to"], [177, "An Evil Dream. 165 resent her introduction otherwise than by a dignified silence. Mrs Bryant bore herself as one placed in a trying position ; expected to control and regu late the affairs of a family, where the mistress and maids alike rebelled against her authority or interference. Occasionally he observed she consulted his mother, and with a manner as far removed from assumption as subservience, yet so as to convey the impression that she was conferring a favour, not accepting one. She took her place at table, entertained them with music, or held a hand at whist when Clarence was at home to play, quite as one of the family, not a salaried housekeeper or companion. She was polite without familiarity, and apparently was unconscious of Mrs Bromley's repugnance. He had set himself to watch his mother and those around her, the Rector \u2014 who had ques tioned his Curate closely on the current reports \u2014having taken an early opportunity to im press on Clarence that she must be an ill-used woman, or she would never have steeped her senses in wine. Consequently, he kept much at home, especially at luncheon and dinner, the persistent wet weather furnishing a good"], [178, "166 The Slowly Grinding Mills. excuse, had he needed one, and he sat with her, reading aloud while she worked at trifles for Christmas presents. But, except a slight trepidation when Mrs Bryant spoke or approached, he saw nothing unusual in her manner or her habits, and nothing to excite apprehension, although the sideboard cellaret was left unlocked, and both wine and spirits were consequently within reach. It was not until Christmas Eve that any difference was perceptible. He had been at the church all the morning assisting at the decorations, and did not get home until the afternoon was advanced, when he found his mother in the kitchen distribut ing gifts of money or clothing to her ' poor pensioners,' as usual \u2014 but not as usual with a clear voice and refined demeanour. She spoke thickly, and made mistakes, and though Clarence went to her assistance, and wished the people a 'happy Christmas,' adding odd shillings of his own to her gifts, he felt assured that not one of the recipients but would go away bewailing the change which had come over the benevolent lady, convinced that she had, in truth, ' taken to drink.' Very sadly he led her away, and, when alone"], [179, "An Evil Dream. 167 with her, expressed his sorrow on her account ; Avhereat she wept copiously, assuring him she had taken less wine than usual, for it burned her throat, and promised to take less, or to drink only claret. She adhered to her resolution, and for some time was as composed and ladylike as any son could desire. And, at the same time, the settled cloud on Mr Bromley's brow appeared to vanish, through Clarence thought his hair was growing perceptibly grey. Christmas Day, with its gifts and greetings, passed without unpleasantness, and although Clarence did not return from church with the others, having special calls to make at the Rectory and Manor House \u2014 where he found Miss Octavia \u2014 all went smoothly at his OAvn home, Mrs Bryant laying herself out to be agreeable. So during the Christmas week, although he was not so much confined to the house, and did not spend all his evenings at home. One day the Curate and his sister dined with them, when all went well, and he fancied his mother was a little more reconciled to the presence of Mrs Bryant, who took so much care off her hands. To be sure, that day, cased in waterproof"], [180, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 168 and shod with goloshes, his mother had gone with him across the moor to the colliery-office for the half-yearly settlement, and the result put Mr Bromley in the best of good humours. He professed to be interested in the Cope land cottages, and hoped the builders would be at work in the spring, when he also proposed to run up some cottage property to front the houses in Back Lane. He even listened com placently to Mrs Bromley's rather gushing account of Nelly Saunders' baby boy, and of Nelly herself as a good housewife. And when the Curate was present launched out on the flourishing prospects of the Gas Company, and the advantage the colliery would derive from it. He sang to a different tune little more than a week later, when the cheque was in the bankt and a sharp frost had followed the heavy rains \u2014 a frost which promised well for skaters and party-givers and goers ; Clarence being the only one at Moorside House who hailed its appearance with satisfaction, Mr Bromley in particular complaining that it would put a stop to the building in progress for the gasworks, though of any stoppage more threatening he had no foreboding."], [181, "An Evil Dream. 169 I have said that miners are especially super stitious, and the farther north you go the more tinctured with superstition you find them. Ben Saunders was a case in point. He had never in his secret heart got over the evil omens attending his wedding-feast ; which came back to him in full force when he lay bruised and battered under the roof of the Curate, though Nellie's ministrations did much to dissipate the gloomy retrospect ; and the birth of his boy did more. It so happened that on the second Wednes day in the New Year, after a hard day's work in the pit, a cleansing-scrub in the back kitchen, and a little kissing and cuddling of wee Jerry, he made a hearty supper of cold goose, rounding off with a huge slice of rich plum-pudding from the Manor House, eaten along with a slice of cheese, and after a comforting pipe, went to bed, and was fast asleep before Nellie had set everything ready for him in the morning. Soon after midnight Nellie was awakened by him struggling and fighting with nightmare. She gave him a shake, cried, ' Ben, Ben, what's the matter with you ? ' and he was roused to consciousness, sitting up in bed, bedewed and tremulous with terror."], [182, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 170 ' Hech, Nell, I thocht I was drooning.

In a little while he said, with shivering awe, ' I thocht, Nell, I was ganging awa to my Avark, an' that a braid burn lay atween me an' the pit, wi' joust a bit wooden brig to cross. Weel, I went alang, whustling through the mirk, wi' my pick ower my shouther, an' my bait-can i' my hand, until I cam till the brig, whar a woman a' i' white stood on the far side, flinging oot her arms gin she wad warn me back.

' Go to sleep and forget.' Easy to say but hard to do ! The drowning, choking, suffocat ing sensation, when the head seemed bursting, and the eyes struck fire, had been all too real to be dismissed so readily. His dream haunted him. He was troubled with conjectures what it might portend, and it was long before oblivion came. And it was long before the waters of Lethe parted. The little Dutch alarum had rung out unheard. Daybreak had folded back the curtains of night, and with them covered the stars before Nelly woke with a start at the cry of her boy. Then all was haste and bustle. The fire was broken up, and the kettle on before Ben had thrust his limbs into his flannel ' duds,' and made a dive under the bed for his shoes. He Avas snatching up his pick and his bait-can, when Nelly stopped him. ' Nay, Ben, as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. You'll none go without your break fast now. Well, let the putter swear.

And surely the clock had struck eight before"], [184, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 172 he strode out at the gate on to the open moor, where there was yet barely sufficient light to dim the glare of burning cinder-heaps at the colliery, his sole guide in the earlier morning hours. He had barely gone three or four hundred yards when the figure of a woman, with some thing white in front of her, was discernible, and a voice hailed him. ' Gwordie, mon, aw've lost ma way. Con you tell ma th' reight road to th' Waterway ? ' He stood stock still as the apparation drew nearer, and a young pig dragging at a string tied to one of its hind legs stood revealed. Here was a misfortune ! To meet a woman on his way to work boded disaster, but a pig and a woman both became doubly disastrous ! He could scarcely command his voice to stretch out his rig-fit arm in the direction of the distant railway arch, and say, ' Ou, ay, ye maun gang under yon railway brig, an' right afore ye tae th' hill tap.' With that his dream flashed across his mind, ' Hout ! Am I gane clean daft, that I suld talk o' the brig an' waterway tae thae bogle of a woman.

What's oop ? Here's thy mon back agyen ! ' Ben's prudence in returning home after the triple warnings with which he had been favoured, was loudly commended. But it involved him in an argument with Mrs Gill to prove that as one man might fall from the cage, or another be crushed under a fall of coal which injured no one else, so a warning to him need not extend to her Geordie and Ned, about whom she had become nervously alarmed. During this discussion with their neighbour, Nelly had been stirring about with her boy on her arm, clearing her place, and collecting little matters for Jerry's morning bath ; when finding the water too hot, she handed the crowing youngster, nothing loth, over to his father, whilst she ran to the beck with a pitcher for fresh water to cool it. Back she came rushing with her pitcher only half-filled, and with a cry which reached her husband before her white face came into sight."], [186, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 174 ' Ben, Ben ! there's hardly a sup of water in the beck ! The stones are dry as this floor, except in the hollow at the far side, where I scooped up this drop.' ' What !

Back he tore like a madman, shouting out ' The pit ! the pit ! Gang an' tell the folk oot bye !

Hardly conscious of what he feared, Mrs Gill was after him with her gown-skirt over her head ; and Nelly was left to huddle clothes on her boy, snatch up a woollen shawl to protect him from the cold, and heedless of herself to hurry off, fast as her limbs would carry her towards Moorside Lane, to startle the owners, breakfasting at ease, with the awful alarm of a flooded pit.

Yet white-faced as were the women with dear ones in the pit, it was surprising to see with what quiet intensity they bent forward as the cage came to the surface, only hailing with sobs or shouts, husband, son or sweetheart brought to bank. It mattered little that they came up half-naked, dripping wet or half-drowned, so long as there was a spark of life for Dr Elliot or Asaph Pratt to recall. The latter had left his master at the main shaft, and gone forward to the new one at the call of Ben Saunders, who, hearing from the men first drawn up that the water was pouring in, and the flood rising, insisted on descending to the rescue of men less familiar with the new workings than himself. It was an anxious time for the onlookers, amongst whom were Nell and Mrs Gill, whose husband and boy were both below in the direct course of the flood, for the cage containing Ben touched water long before the chain ran out.

Yet another woman went down on her knees and thanked God for the restoration of her son, though Asaph and Norman Sedgwick between them had much ado to bring him back to life. Again, whilst Nell held her struggling babe close to her breast in breathless dread, did her Ben go bravely down to the rescue. This time less of the chain was unwound, and longer was the waiting before his signal told that he at least was safe, and he came to the surface, faint and exhausted, but bringing with him two men, one almost past help, the other just able to protest against the third descent of his deliverer.

PARTNERSHIP AND PARTNER. Hovering on the skirts of the crowd, now here, now there, questioning first this one, then that, had been Mr Bromley, biting his thumb nail, and fingering his buttons in nervous despera tion. All his fine schemes were threatened with collapse, and the subtle fiend tearing at his heart-strings held him as in a vice. At last he put the timid question to the Squire, whose agitation, from widely different causes, was great as was his own, \u2014 - ' I suppose, Mr Stanfield, you will not be able yet to estimate the loss ? ' The Squire turned round upon him with a look of scorn. 'Loss, sir!' burst from him like a storm. ' There are tAventy-four human beings under the black waters in that pit, with no chance of recovering even their dead bodies, for the flood still rises and defies the pumps. Ask the bereaved to estimate the loss. Ask the poor"], [192, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 180 creature Avhose anguish has turned her brain. If you mean the monetary loss, sir, it is simply ruinous. ' So saying he turned on his heel in supreme contempt. He would have given every acre of his estate could he have brought those miners, entombed or drowned, to bank alive. His heart bled for the sorrowing survivors, whose piteous lamentations filled his ears, and seemed to say that these men and boys had died in his service. How the catastrophe had occurred no one appeared to know. There is always more or less percolation through the soil to the cuttings, but the men first to escape, and who gave the alarm at the up-cast shaft, said the water broke in upon them in a stream, and barely gave them time to gain the headway. Some of the men might crawl to higher levels, but unless the water could be got under there was no hope for them. The short day was drawing to a melancholy close, when up came Clarence in a feverish state of excitement. ' Squire,' exclaimed he, ' I have succeeded in tracing the flood to its source. There is a swallow-hole in the limestone bed of the beck,"], [193, "Partnership and Partner. 181 about hals-a-mile away, into which nearly the whole body of the water is disappearing. You know it is not an uncommon circumstance in streams flowing over limestone.' ' I know, I know, my boy, but that only makes the matter more hopeless. We shall have a lake here instead of a colliery before long if that be the case,' responded the Squire, in the tone of a man tried beyond endurance. ' Nay, nay, sir. I should not have troubled you with the cause had I been unable to suggest a remedy.' The distracted Squire was at once all ears, as were a little knot of gentlemen who closed round the two unfortunate partners. ' I suspected how the disaster originated when Ben Saunders told me that the beck was dry, and that his mates had been bringing down the coal with gunpowder in the new workings. At once I set off, and he after me, to track the stream's course upwards, and there ' \u2014 pointing with outstretched arm \u2014 'there where the beck rounds the rock, and forms a long loop towards the colliery, we found the fatal gap. And I think, sir, that by cutting a fresh channel across the loop beyond that outcrop ping ridge, so as to enter the old bed above"], [194, "182 The Slowly Grinding Mills. and below the swallow-hole, we may check the downpour and give the pumps a chance.' ' Ay, and restore the water to the people along the banks who depend on the beck for their supply. You are a sharp lad, Clarence. I will see what Anderson says to-morrow, and if he consider it possible, it may find work for men we should otherwise have to pay for idling. At all events I shall go home more hopeful for your suggestion. It will lessen the blow to my dear wife. Yet in any case, my boy, this will be a disastrous day for both of us.' Mr Stanfield and Mr Anderson were early on the spot the next day. Yet early as they were they found Ben Saunders and Clarence hard at work ; the former prudently clearing and stack ing the surface turf as a preliminary, along a line the latter was marking out in full reliance on his own judgment. ' I'm not wanted here, Mr Stanfield,' said the engineer with a broad smile, ' your young partner appears quite equal to the occasion. He has suggested the only solution to your difficulty. Pumping is practically useless, so long as such a volume of water continues to pour in. And I find the short channel Mr Cope land is marking out, so far remote from the"], [195, "Partnership and Partner. 183 calamitous \"swallow,\" as to minimise the chances of a similar catastrophe in the future. Of course you will continue pumping to keep the flood under as far as practicable. But I should set men at work here without delay. Good morning, Mr Copeland, let me congratulate you on your scientific usefulness.' The desolate spot which no foot trod in less than four hours became a thronged and busy scene where men and boys \u2014 ay and women \u2014 were working as for their lives. Bare-armed men, with ringing picks, smote the grey lime stone, which split into rectangular fragments beneath their well-directed blows. Others dug or shovelled up the earth and loose shale which lay there in patches, whilst women and boys with baskets and barroAvs, cleared away all the debris ; the putten-hewers being sent to cut and stack the turf in advance, as Ben had done, to dry for fuel. The length to be excavated was little over a hundred yards, and the width barely eight feet, still depth had to be allowed for sudden freshets to which the beck was liable. But the workers were many, and had been stimulated by the Squire's offer of extra pay and a supply of ale, to which Clarence appended a reminder that"], [196, "184 The Slowly Grinding Mills. they were working to recover their dead as Avell as to save the pit. Indeed, so well they plied their picks and spades that in less than a month the last stony barrier was broken down, and with a roar the old beck, swollen with February rains, rushed like a race-horse along its new course, to the joy of all concerned. Yet in those weeks the water had risen higher and higher in the pit, defying the pumps. And the openly expressed opinion of experts was that Squire Stanfield, in cutting the new channel, had possibly anticipated litigation for the stoppage of an ancient water course, but he would fling away a fortune if he attempted to drain Stanmoor pit, it was ' drowned-out ' beyond redemption. The consternation caused by the catastrophe in Highfield had its echoes in every colliery district, and the town was crowded with strangers eager for information. To the in habitants it was a much more serious event ; the welfare of so many was identified with the fortunes of the two houses in Moorside Lane. At the first alarm, the Rector, excited beyond his wont at Mrs Pratt's appalling intelligence' had left his breakfast to follow in the earlier"], [197, "Partnership and Partner. 185 footsteps of his Curate, with red-eyed Miss Preston by his side. Irene, forbidden to approach the moor, rushed off in tears to her godfather's, and on the doorstep encountered Norman in his old house-coat hurrying to render any possible service with hand or brain, for both of which he found uses. Mrs Pratt had, of course, magnified the disaster in her account, but though Irene was assured all the miners were not lost, she did not find much other consolation there. ' Ugh ! rumour's a confounded liar ; never believe half she says, Missie,' jerked out her godfather, tempering down his own irritability in speaking to her. ' Yet if the flood be only half as bad as we hear, it will be a terrible loss to the owners. The Squire, with his large landed estates, may bear up against it, but to Clarence Copeland it will be nothing short of ruin. That stepfather of his won't disgorge a shilling to help him, I know.' ' Oh, god-papa ! ' ejaculated Irene, her tears streaming down her cheeks. ' Nay, nay, Theobald,' interposed Miss Selina, ' do not prophesy evils that may never come. But if the worst come to the worst, Clarence"], [198, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 186 is young and clever, and may make his way in the world for himself. Others have done .it before now.' An expressive nod pointed the last words. ' Ugh ! but not without a shilling ! ' Irene was in despair. The picture the pair had drawn was terrible. Tearful as she was, she hurried away to Octavia at the Manor House, hoping for better tidings. Mrs Stanfield kept invalid hours, and was not yet visible. 'My dear Irene,' began Octavia, 'dry your eyes, and bathe your face with this Eau-de- Cologne. My mother must not see you in that condition. We are toning down intelligence as much as possible for her. A sudden shock might be fatal. Besides, no catastrophe is so bad as is first represented. There is always a something to redeem the evil.' ' Yes, dear, but your papa is rich. My poor Clarence has no dependence but the colliery.' ' My child, don't look at a loss of that kind. Think of the lives sacrificed, and of the widows and orphans left destitute. Think of poor Mrs Armstrong with her three little ones, and his aged mother ! ' ' Is he drowned ? '"], [199, "Partnership and Partner. 187 ' So we have just heard. There are losses greater than the loss of money,' added Octavia, soberly. And tender-hearted Irene was awed into composure on the score of Clarence. A calamitous day it had been for many, but on no one had the blow fallen more keenly than on Mr Bromley. The men drowned in the pit had died in the discharge of duty. He had sinned to gain wealth and position, and his gains were melting away like wax in a crucible, sear ing his heart in the process. The destruction of Stanmoor Colliery threatened the stability of the very Gas Company he had promoted, and in Avhich he held so many shares. He had counted on extra emoluments from coal supplied during the remaining minority of Clarence, but contracts elsewhere would mean extra calls and reduced dividends. He had heard nothing of his stepson's proposal to save the mine, and Avent back to Moorside House with his brain on fire and his nerves in a quiver : a coward \u2014 to himself confessedly a coward \u2014 afraid to face the two women on its hearth. On the very doorstone he was met with Mrs Bryant's peculiar smile, and the stinging sarcasm, ' What of the lucrative partnership now, Nicholas Bromley, Esq. ?'"], [200, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 188 His face blanched and his form seemed to collapse as he slunk past her into the family room, where he found Mrs Bromley in her bonnet and paletot, sobbing as if her heart would break for the poor bereaved women she had been amongst on the moor. ' Mrs Bromley appears so wofully distressed for the misfortunes of others ; I fear she overlooks probable consequences nearer home,' was said by the same thin lips, with a double edged sneer which cut at both. At once the weeping Mrs Bromley gathered herself up and retired to her own room, leaving the cowed man and the reigning housekeeper to dine together with what digestion they might find Clarence did not appear. He spent the night in the pumping-house at the colliery, relieving the engineer, and glad of the mechanical ability. Mr Langley had made the most of the occasion, sending a long account of the flooded colliery to the Colborough Messenger, adding as 'later intelligence by telegraph:' \u2014 'Mr Clarence Copeland has formulated a scheme for relieving the submerged pit.' Late though it was, news of so much importance displaced other matter. And when Mr Bromley opened"], [201, "Partnership and Partner. 189 his damp paper on the Friday morning, it was the first item to arrest his attention. It sent him limping on to the moor for particulars, and for the moment put another aspect on affairs. But when he heard strangers from other collieries pooh-pooh the idea, and talk of the thousands it would cost to drain the pit, even if the plan succeeded, he went back still more rueful. Cursing the oversight which had left the partnership deed undiscovered among dusty books, for Jack Reid to chuckle over, he bent his steps to Theobald Sedg wick's. He mioht as well have run his head against a blank wall. ' The paper found was the draft, not the deed ; that went into our client's pri vate keeping. We cannot betray one client's affairs to another, sir.' The snub made Nicholas Bromley savage. ' I must learn if there be any clause making the Copeland estate liable in case of accident,' he muttered, recommencing a flurried and snappish search, which did not end with the library, if it did with defeat, over which the watchful housekeeper smiled derisively. Clarence was seldom at home, except to sleep, whilst the new cutting was in progress,"], [202, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 190 or they might have come into collision. Mr Bromley's temper had grown so uncertain ; the pin-pricks to his conscience, and the drafts upon his narrowed purse were so many and unavoidable. The Curate preached a most pathetic sermon in behalf of the widows and orphans. Could he allow the plate to pass, or be niggardly with all eyes upon him ? Or could he ignore the gen eral appeal to the county in the Colborough Messenger with the Old Bank for treasury, Avhen among the first list of donors appeared the leaders of Highfield society, and greater magnates still ? But when busy Mr Langley had opened an independent subscription at the Institute 'for the benefit of the widow, orphans and aged mother of their late lamented and most worthy secretary, Mr Armstrong,' whose intimate friend he had been when a poorer man, he parted with his coin as if it had been drops of blood, and excused his lessened liberality on the plea of personal loss and other demands. And he never visited the poor widow, at whose table he had been so hospitably welcomed. Miss Octavia might go and arrange with Miss Croft for mourning for the family, and Mrs Bromley might find her way to Bridge End, but"], [203, "Partnership and Partner. 191 he showed no face there, and she might have gone empty handed had Clarence been as backward with supplies. Unfortunately, Avhen she went abroad, she generally appeared more or less muddled and confused ; and compas sionate though she might be towards others, she roused more compassion for Mr Bromley and more consideration for Mrs Bryant, they being supposed to ' have a trying time with her.' She was in some such condition when Octavia found her at Mrs Armstrong's, where her errand of mercy was all but lost sight of in the shock and pain of the discovery. Hitherto Octavia had defended her old friend. Henceforth she was constrained to be silent. Silent as was Clarence on the altered state of thing at Moor side House, or his frequent protests against the domineering spirit of his stepfather. His manner towards his stepson had become peculiarly offensive since the disaster at the colliery, and no sooner had Herbert started for Rugby alone, by which he gauged the other's finances, than, with the meanness of a little nature, he gave Clarence clearly to understand that he was an encumbrance, if not in so many direct words. He was free in his remarks on the folly of Squire Stanfield in throwing away"], [204, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 192 money on an extra pumping engine, on encour aging others with false hopes to fold their hands in idleness, expecting friends to maintain them, instead of earning an honest living in the world, as better fellows had to do. The allusions at such times were alike pungent and pointed. Naturally high-spirited Clarence retorted, and altercations ensued. These served Mr Bromley to sigh and shake his head over, as stepfather's troubles with an unruly stepson, who wasted his days in idle expectation. They served also for Mrs Bryant to drop expressions of 'surprise at Mr Copeland's fierce and ungovernable temper ' into the recep tive ear of Martha Pratt. Sorrowful admission of high Avords and angry disputes were drawn from servants with her inquisitorial corkscrew. And these travelled by domestic channels to the Rectory and elsewhere. Ere long Clarence became vaguely conscious of a fall in the thermometer. Intimates became distant, trades-people unduly familiar, and at length it struck him that both the Curate and the Rector received him with lessened cordiality, and that even Miss Preston grew fidgety when he called. At the Manor House he was always welcome."], [205, "Partnership and Partner. 193 The Squire hailed him as the salvor of the colliery. And neither with Octavia nor Irene was there any sign of frostiness in the air. Indeed the latter clung to him the closer for his misfortunes, defended him with unlooked for spirit against aspersions of which Clarence him self knew nothing ; and when he went to her smarting under recent sarcasm, torn with con flicting feelings and duties, or depressed by his anomalous position and the uncertainty of the outlook before him, she was a veritable ' Sun beam ' on his path. She had a religious faith that nothing could dim, and when he was most tried she brought its hopes and promises to cheer and rouse him. The trials of her lover had drawn forth all that was strongest and best in her nature. The pretty waxen blossom had unfolded in the darkness, and the full bloom had a pure Avoman's heart, rich with priceless sweetness. VOL. III. N"], [206, "194 CHAPTER XI IT. DRIVEN FROM HOME. Clarence had early occasion to put her faith and affection to the proof. One blustering morning, towards the end of March, when Herbert had come home for the Easter holidays, the post brought to him, from the builder, the old plans for the cottages once more left in abeyance. Upstairs he went after breakfast to replace them in his late father's brass - mounted desk, whence they had been taken. To his astonishment, the key refused to turn in the lock. It was a peculiar key, of bright steel. He examined it closely. The key was all right. He blew down the barrel and tried again. Something rattled in the lock, but the key would not go round. He bore his desk to the light. The escutcheon was scarred and scratched. Someone had apparently been tampering with the lock. He probed it with his penknife. The wards were broken, and out dropped a bit of a small brass key."], [207, "Driven from Home. 195 Downstairs he hurried, his teeth set, his eyes and cheeks aflame, his nostrils panting, the bit of brass upon his outstretched palm. ' To Avhom does this belong ? ' he asked, sternly, confronting Mr Bromley as he rose from table. ' That ? ' said he, with a futile show of ignor ance. ' What is that ? ' 'Yes!' repeated Clarence. 'What is that? Someone has been tampering with the lock of my desk, and there lies the proof. Who in this house owns the broken key ? ' Mrs Bromley looked scared, and clasped her hands together with a moan. ' What do you mean, you insolent young jackanapes ? Do you insinuate that / have meddled with your lock ? ' blustered his step father in well-feigned indignation. ' Someone has done it. And I find I must carry my desk where it will be held sacred.' ' You had better carry yourself out with it, and never show your impudent face here again,' was the quick retort. Timid Mrs Bromley wrung her hands in feeble protest. Clarence looked the speaker full in the face. 'Never, until an honest man is master.'"], [208, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 196 Had he struck Mr Bromley a blow, he could not have recoiled more surely. He went livid. Was it with fear or rage ? Mrs Bryant must have known, for into his ear she covertly shot the one word, ' Coward ! ' The voice of Clarence came ringing from the outer kitchen door, \u2014 'Tim, Tim! Run to the New Inn. Have the fly here in half-an-hour ! ' Upstairs he flew, three steps at a time, his mother's feeble ' Ah me, ah me,' falling on deaf ears. Into bags and portmanteaux clothes and other belongings were being thrust indiscrim inately in his rage. ' Let me do that for you, Mr Clarence,' said Sally, the old cook, at his elbow. ' And don't you leave a mite you can help for that Mrs Bryant to turn over. Me and Thomas is leaving- to gether at Easter. We are going to be married, and let lodgings at the seaside somewheres ; so I don't care a fig for Mrs Bryant. I only wish your dear mother was out of their hands \u2014 I do,' said the good woman in the midst of her hasty packing. The last strap was buckled, the last package in the hall, little remembrances left for the"], [209, "Driven from Home. 197 servants, by the time the fly was at the door. Neither Mr Bromley nor Mrs Bryant was visible, nor had his mother dared to seek him out. Whilst Tim and the driver were busy with his luggage, Clarence turned into the morning room, and found his mother huddled up in her chair, as if afraid to stir, and sobbing piteously. At the sight, sorrow contended with rage. ' Mother,' said he in a strained voice, ' I am deeply grieved to leave you thus. Perhaps when I am gone you may live more peaceably, and be happier. I am about to tempt Fortune in London. When I am settled, I will write \u2014 not here, but to the care of the Squire. The man who would open another's desk would in tercept a letter. See ! here is the key of poor Mrs _ Gill's cottage. Take care of it. Some day she may leave the asylum cured. Let her find everything as she left it. And now, good-bye, dear mother, and God bless you ! ' She flung her arms around his neck, and held him close, and, when she dropped back into her chair, his burning cheeks were wet either with her tears or his own. Thomas was at the gate. ' This is a Avoful parting, Maister Clarence,'"], [210, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 198 said the old man, shaking his grey head. ' I never thought I should live to see a day like this!' ' Nor I, Thomas.' He wrung the honest hand he had clung to as a toddling child, leav ing a sovereign in the horny palm. ' Hout, hinny, I canna' tak' it, Ye'll mebbe want it yersel' ere long \u2014 ' but the fly was off, and Thomas left drawing his shirt sleeve across his eyes. The overloaded fly toiled up the hill far too slowly for Clarence, whose blood was at fever heat with passion and outraged pride. He would have driven past the Manor House, ashamed to confess that he had been turned out of doors by the man his mother had stooped to marry, but there, at the lodge gate, stood Herbert, and, with a sign, brought the vehicle to a standstill. ' What is this I hear from Tim ? ' he asked. ' You were surely not departing without a word to any of us ! ' Pride and shame dyed the countenance of Clarence, but he yielded to the voice of his trusty old chum. The fly was turned in at the gateway, and took the unprepared Squire by surprise. There was a hurried explanation,"], [211, "Driven from Home. 199 over which the good gentleman shook his head, though he applauded the young man's desire for independence. The impregnable desk, a case or two of minerals, and a few other such treasures were consigned to Herbert's den for safe keeping. The Squire was sturdily assured that the exile was not short of money ; and then, after a few words of fatherly advice and approval of his plans \u2014 in which Miss Octavia joined most heartily, followed a sobered leave-taking ; and his good friends were left to discuss the strange turn of events at their leisure. After all, he was not sorry his first hasty im pulse to quit Highfield in indignant silence had been rendered abortive. The fierceness of his wrath had in no wise abated, but that half-hour at the Manor House had convinced him, however painful explanation and parting with his friends might be, that headlong rush without a word of farewell was a mistake. He had dreaded a deluge of tears from Irene at the first hint of his departure. But although her face burned with indignation at the treat ment he had received, and her lips quivered with the effort to keep emotion in check, she"], [212, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 200 echoed the opinion of the Stanfields, that, under existing circumstances, he was better away from Highfield. ' You are certain to find an outlet for your talents in a wider field,' she said, hopefully, little knowing the dangers and difficulties to be en countered in that wider field, ' and there must be more dignity in labouring with either your hands or brain, than in sitting still waiting for Fortune's wheel to turn. I could not let you go, dear Clarence, if I did not think it best. There can be nothing to prevent your return in case the Squire succeeds. But should he not, and I have heard many adverse opinions, you will be glad you have not wasted your years in fruitless expectation. ' It was no intention of mine to rust in idle ness,' interjected Clarence. ' I was on the look out for a post I could creditably fill when that brute of a stepfather snatched his first chance to get rid of me. I feel worst, my darling, about leaving you, uncertain as I am when we shall meet again or I be able to claim you.

I know you will not change, neither"], [213, "Driven from Home. 201 shall I. When you only see the cloud, re member the sun is shining behind it.' ' I shall think of my blessed Sunbeam, how ever dark the clouds may be,' replied he con fidently ; ' and the very thought will drive away the shadows ' \u2014 a smile breaking through the sadness of his countenance as he spoke, and stooped to take another farewell kiss. Miss Preston was out. The Rector was away at some arch\u00e6ological gathering. He escaped further questioning and explanation, but he found his parting with Irene a terrible wrench, and when he shut himself up in the fly, felt much like one Avho has had a limb torn off. As for Irene, brave a face as she had put on, no sooner had the door closed behind him, than her strained nerves gave way, and when Miss Preston came home she found her deluged in tears, and sobbing as if her heart would break. But Clarence had not done with Highfield when he had dismissed the fly and seated him- \u2022\u2022 self in an empty second-class carriage. At the last moment Norman Sedgwick's long legs bestrode the platform in haste ; and Clarence had a travelling companion as far as Colborough, whose sole errand . might have"], [214, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 202 been to do him a service, he made such good use of the time at his disposal. ' So Ave are about to lose you, Mr Copeland, I hear. Do you know much of London ? ' initiated a conversation which did not end until he had given the other some useful hints anent economic lodging and living, the search for a situation, and the avoidance of ' loafers.' The train slackened speed while he was saying, 'At Peele's Coffee-house in Fleet Street, for merely a nominal fee, you will be enabled to search the files of all the chief newspapers in the kingdom. But, unless you have other introductions, I would recommend you to take my card to the address on the back, and Mr Gifford will, I am sure, do his utmost to forward your aims.' The train came to a stand-still, and Clarence was left with the card in his hand to pursue his journey alone, and to imagine what ' alone in London ' might mean. He had never before taken a long journey alone, never travelled without a specific destination in view. Strangers coming in and going out at the various stations only served to accentuate the growing sense of solitariness. It was nightfall when he landed at King's"], [215, "Driven from Home. 203 Cross. An inn close at hand sheltered him for the night. In a few days he had found a lodging. in the Euston Road, more in accord with his limited means than with his birth or aspirations, and there was a certain stamp of respectability upon the road at that date. He had also found the side entrance to Peele's reading-room, and turned over the papers on the stands, to small purpose, being at first somewhat choice in his own requirements. Then, alternately in the Mining Journal, the Colliery Guardian, or the Mechanics' Magazine, an advertisement addressed to ' Mining Engineers and Others,' by a young man of good education and some practical knowledge, desirous to obtain an appointment, began to appear. Letters were to be addressed to Peele's Coffee-house ; but there was appar ently no response, and hope must have gone down almost to zero in the young man's breast, as weeks and months went by and his funds gradually diminished. Some latent jealousy must have perplexed him with questionings how Norman Sedgwick became aware of his removal, and the motives prompting his apparent interest for Clarence, permitted a second week to go by before he"], [216, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 204 presented Norman's card and himself before speckless Mr Gifford. And either the card must have been a sufficient recommendation, or there had been correspondence in the mean time ; for, although the solicitor eyed his visitor from head to foot through his spectacles, his reception was reassuring. He led Clarence rather to speak of himself and his views than questioned him ; and discovering that unoccu pied time hung heavily on his hands, suggested study at the British Museum \u2014 himself second ing the young fellow's application for a reading ticket, also promising to keep a look-out for anything in his line. He was bowed out, but not until Mr Gifford had volunteered to become his referee, and had cautioned him against accepting any offer without previous consulta tion. The Museum ticket was a safeguard, and a resource to him in many ways. Not only did he pursue his special studies with avidity, but as if the very atmosphere was infectious, he put to paper some of his own practical ideas with respect to coal-mines, which found ready en trance into the mining papers, though they brought him little remuneration. At all events, between his studies, his search"], [217, "Driven from Home. 205 for employment, his letters to Irene and to Herbert, and his other writing, which filled his evening hours, he had little leisure for mis chievous brooding, or still more mischievous dissipation. Sunday mornings always saw him at one church or another, and although he might not favour Irene with synoptic sermons in his letters she had a pretty fair account how his time was spent. Of course he told of his meeting with Norman Sedgwick in the train, of his practical advice, and his introduction to Mr Gifford, from which he hoped so much. Then of an invita tion to dine with the solicitor and his family ; but as time dragged on his letters became less hopeful, not all Irene's transparent efforts to buoy him up, sufficing to keep him from fits of despondence. As for Irene, she filtered the Highfield news before she sent it. She let him know that Mr Bromley was pushing forward the Gas Company, and spent much of his time watching the pro gress of the works, as they advanced towards completion, and that she thought he looked greyer and older. But she said no word of his exculpatory protest against his stepson's abusive conduct and angry renunciation of his home."], [218, "206 The Slowly Grinding Mills. She reported the palpable diminution of the water in the mine, but said nothing of the time and cost likely to be expended in the drainage. She referred to meetings with his mother at the Curate's, but not to the marked change in her manner and appearance for the worse. And she conveyed many a kindly message from Miss Octavia and Miss Sedgwick, to say nothing of those from her own home, which, so far as the Rector was concerned, might have been warmer. He was evidently affected by the stories afloat concerning Clarence, the Curate himself having inadvertently become a medium for their trans mission. Of these rumours, or her own heart aches on his account, her letters said nothing. ' He has sadness enough, poor fellow, without any added pain from me,' she argued, and wrote of her love and fidelity, and her trust that Pro vidence would befriend him, with never a shadow of doubt to disturb or trouble him. But love is not always so blind as fables say, and he could read her anxiety between the lines. He had been three months in London ; his drafts on the old Colborough Bank were still honoured, but he knew that his balance must be gradually dwindling. He had exchanged his first-floor apartments for a single room above,"], [219, "Driven from Home. 207 and began to exercise stricter economy. Thanks to the good wardrobe he had brought with him, he had no immediate dread of shabbi ness, but he had learned to restrict his purchases in the way of gloves and ties. He had lowered his pride to apply for a common clerkship to a surveyor, and was waiting a reply with nervous anxiety when an unexpected summons from Mr Gifford gave fresh vitality to hope. ' Have you any objection to go abroad ? ' asked Mr Gifford, playing with his folded spectacles. ' Not the slightest,' was the quick response, ' if that means an opening for me.' ' Well, sir, a reputable firm of contractors, to whom I am solicitor, has empowered me to treat with you, to ascertain if you will join an expedi tion now being fitted out for the exploration of a certain tract in Brazil in quest of coal. The invitation comes from the proprietor of the land. Some way your capabilities have become known to the firm. The remuneration Avould be liberal ; and, if you have no objection on the score of climate or of distance, I will arrange for an interview with the heads of the firm. And you must be prepared to con tract for three years certain.'"], [220, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 208 Had the expedition been to the North Pole, Clarence would have joined it, rather than linger on with the growing feeling that there was no place nor use for him in the world. And he hailed the three years' contract as an advantageous certainty. Messrs Morrison & Gilmour looked open eyed at him on his introduction, and then at each other. ' Surely there must be some mistake,' sug gested Mr Morrison. ' You cannot be the Mr Clarence Copeland who did such prompt service at Stanmore Colliery ? ' ' I planned a fresh channel for the beck. If that is what you mean ; most certainly.' 'And you are also the C. C. who has been for some time contributing to The Mining Journal?' ' Oh, yes,' put in Clarence readily. ' Really ! We had expected a much older person,' said Mr Gilmour, with incredulous astonishment. Clarence was dismayed. ' I trust my age, or rather the want of it, will be no bar to my appointment.' 'Oh, dear no, if Mr Gifford certifies your identity."], [221, "Driven from Home. 209 Mr Gifford's manager did. And when Clarence left the office the contract had been signed and he introduced to his future col leagues, men much older than himself, one of Avhom was in command. He was informed their ship, the Diamond, would sail in four days. He must lose no time in getting his outfit on board. He ran his eyes over the list. It was for midable only in the state of his finances. It was a difficulty he had not foreseen. It was anticipated by Mr Gifford. 'I am empowered,' said he, 'to hand you over fifty pounds in advance of your salary, for your provisional requirements, and will trouble you to sign that receipt.' As Clarence affixed his signature he observed in a vague sort of way that only the name of Mr Gifford appeared upon the receipt ; but years elapsed before he learned that it was to Squire Stanfield, rather than to Mr Gifford, he was indebted alike for his appointment and that timely advance. Hurried letters to catch the late mail carried the glad tidings to Irene and the Squire. A briefer note of thanks went to Norman Sedg wick. To his mother he wrote with more VOL. III. o"], [222, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 210 deliberation ; but in all he made light of the three years' absence. Back came letters of congratulation ; but Irene's was stained and blotted with irrepressible tears, in spite of her pride in the recognition of his talents. His mother's reply, which reached him too late to be read before he was settled in his berth, was pitched in quite another key. It was a wail over his absence, a foreboding that they should never meet again, and cast quite a gloom over his anticipations. That was his first sea voyage. Father Neptune did not spare him, and by the time our young geologist stumbled up on to the deck again, he had recovered his mental equilibrium. Meanwhile Highfield chronicles had been rather bald. Stagnation had set in with the Stanmoor catastrophe ; and after the distribu tion of the Relief-fund, which for the time being found ample occupation alike for Rector and Curate, there was a gradual exodus of the min ing population. The engineer and others engaged in pumping operations did not count, nor did the few for whom the gasworks found employment. Many of the putters and hewers were drafted to Sir John Spencer's, but five miles"], [223, "Driven from Home. 211 might have been five hundred for any call they had to Highfield. Trade naturally languished, and even the Institute seemed less flourishing, as if it felt the loss of its energetic secretary. Christmas came and went, the Squire had begun to calculate the completion of his hazardous undertaking within a measurable period. Mrs Stanfield was gradually gathering strength, but there had been no return to the customary festivities, and, as the Manor House generally took the initiative, there was very little party giving even among the young people, Consequently Octavia Stanfield and Norman Sedgwick very rarely met, unless in the street, on coming out of church ; but then, although they might flush to the temples when their hands met, or their eyes, the constraint born on the unlucky concert night strengthened rather than wore away. He was no longer the 'mere lawyer's clerk,' she was of age, mistress of her own fortune, as his arrangement of the legal formalities had made him well aware ; but that which should have drawn them closer, seeing that they loved each other passionately and entirely, only held them farther apart. Her money became an insurmountable barrier. Had their been more social intercourse, as"], [224, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 212 of old, that barrier might have been overleaped, for Norman had a growing balance at the bank to which he was steadily adding, with the sole hope of lessening the distance between them. It might have been an absurd expectation but for a germ of hope floating on gossip's thistle down. Spenceburn was gay if Highfield was dull. Lady Spencer's guests were of the best county society, and she was seldom content unless Octavia made one. Her covert design, thor oughly approved by Sir John, was to remove her infatuated sister from the sphere of that ' lawyer fellow,' and marry her to someone ' fit to associate with.' But months and seasons waxed and waned, Octavia shone at balls and garden parties, rumour proclaimed that a gallant major and a sporting baronet were at feud on her account, and that Lady Spencer was furious because her black-eyed sister had presumed to refuse a coronet with a husband attached. Whatever these rumours might be worth, and whether they came to him through Mrs Pratt, or his more reliable Aunt Selina, they served to preserve Hope's flickering taper from extinction."], [225, "Driven from Home. 213 So matters stood in that dreary end of a Avet February, when Highfield was startled out of sleep by the report that Mrs Bromley had fled from Moorside House in a state of intense excitement and taken refuge in the deserted cottage of Mrs Gill."], [226, "214 CHAPTER XIV. SORROWS UNSHARED. Nelly Saunders was the mercury on whose winged feet the strange intelligence sped to Miss Octavia at the Manor House. In consideration of his bravery Ben had been offered the post of stoker to the new pump ing engine, pending drainage, so that he might have no occasion to remove Nelly from her old haunts and friends. He had been one of the first to enter the drained pit and resume his own occupation, after the dead remains were buried. Thus Nelly was on the spot when Mrs Bromley came stumbling through a blinding shower of rain and tears to fumble at the next-door lock which she was too agi tated to open. ' Why, Mrs Bromley, whatever can have brought you here on a day like this ? ' cried Nelly in amazement, as she turned the key in the stiff lock and opened the door. ' I've come to live here, Nelly,' sobbed the"], [227, "Sorrows Unshared. 215 lady, sinking into the nearest chair in deep distress. ' Come to live here ? ' echoed Nelly, in still greater astonishment. ' You, a lady born ? ' and she began to wonder if Mrs Bromley was out of her mind, or was not sober. ' Yes ; this is my \u2014 my son's house,' she sobbed; 'and here I \u2014 I mean to stay until he \u2014 he comes back to \u2014 to stand by me, and \u2014 oh, dear, dear me ! ' There was nothing more coherent to be got out of her, and seeing that there Mrs Bromley evidently did intend to remain, having brought a small travelling-bag in her hand, Nelly prevailed on her, with much persuasion, to take a seat by her own comfortable fireside, and have an eye on little Jerry, whilst she gave a rough polish to the rusty grate, lit a fire, set the bed to air, and did what else she could to remove the discomfort and fustiness of the long-closed dwelling. It was not a protracted process in her ener getic hands. She was speedily back on her own hearth, setting out for her remarkable visitor her best tea-things on her best tray, the lady's own gift, mixing and baking a special ' singing-hinny,' and providing as"], [228, "216 The Slowly Grinding Mills. cheery a cup of tea as she well could on so short a notice ; now and again calling in quisitive little Jerry away from the strange lady lest he should become troublesome. She withdrew him altogether with a piece of cake in his hand on the plea of looking after the fire and other matters in the next house, which certainly wanted more than a cursory ' redding-up ' to make it fit for habi tation even for one of her own class. After a reasonable time spent in turning out cup boards and drawers, she went back with hungry Jerry in her arms, to find Mrs Bromley with her hands clasped tightly in her lap, and staring at vacancy, whilst tears rolled silently down her faded cheeks ; her tea neglected. Nelly's exclamation, ' Why, ma'am, you've let your cake and tea go cold ! ' caused her to start, shiver, and with an effort to recall her wandering wits, gulp down the cup of cold, untasted tea. Then she rose, apologised for intruding, and disturbing Mrs Saunders, thanked her for kind attention, and walked from one house to the other, as one utterly cowed and humiliated, with scarcely a shred of her old dignity clinging to her."], [229, "Sorrows Unshared. 217 She closed the door behind her. There was a good fire blazing in the grate, a paraffin lamp alight upon the table; she stood in the middle of the floor to take a survey of the place, the common quilt on the good bed, already made, the bit of rug on the hearth, the chest of drawers no longer bright, the vulgar chimney ornaments, and wood-bottomed chairs, and throwing off bonnet and dark tartan shawl, sat down in dead Geordie Gill's arm-chair, saying, ' Here, at least, I may live in peace till Clarence comes ! Ay, till my boy comes home to right me ! ' And so in her hour of direst shame and agony, the mistress of Moor side House took possession of the pitman's foodless cottage as a haven of rest and peace ; the benumbing sense of a great wrong, just discovered, crushing out all minor thoughts and cares. The fire and the lamp both went out ; yet there she sat, and there at length sleep found her. And there she still sat until, roused by a loud knocking, she woke stiff and chill at eight the next morning to let in Nelly Saunders and a welcome warm breakfast. Ten minutes later Nelly, with Jerry in her arms, was speeding towards the Manor House"], [230, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 218 intent on consultation with Miss Octavia ; both she and Ben feeling their incompetence to deal with a case so mysterious and perplexing. ' Really, Nelly, this is extraordinary ! ' ex claimed Miss Octavia when the other had told all she knew. 'And she entered into no explanation, you say ? ' ' Not a word, miss. All she said was, she had come to live there until Mr Clarence came home.' ' Do you think Mrs Bromley was \u2014 a \u2014 quite herself.' ' Sober, Miss ? Oh yes, quite. At first I fancied she was not ; but, yes, miss, she was as sober as I am.' ' And she had no clothes with her ? ' ' Nothing but what she stood up in, miss. Her bag would not hold more than a night gown and her dressing things. I wish you could come and persuade her to go home. That poor place is never fit for the like of her. And there isn't a bite or sup of anything in the house.' ' We can soon remedy that. Go to cook and say you are to have a fowl, a white loaf, and some butter. But mind, not a syllable about Mrs Bromley.' Nelly was discreet, and cook not curious."], [231, "Sorrows Unshared. 219 Mrs Saunders came in for many supplements to her larder. Miss Octavia's morning ramble led her down the lane through the mud to the moor, but she failed to penetrate Mrs Bromley's motive for quitting her own home, or in persuading her to return. ' No, no, don't ask me, don't ask me ! ' she wailed, wringing her hands in tribulation. ' I can never go back ; I can never go back. I shall wait here for Clarence to come ! ' And that was all Octavia could extract from her, but sobs and tears. Then, not before, Octavia laid the singular case before the Squire and her mother. They were equally concerned and perplexed. The former made it his business to seek out Mr Bromley, and ask him for an explana tion. It was his first visit to Moorside House under the new mastership. A strange servant opened the door. He was shown into the familiar drawing-room. Mr Bromley limped in with as much com posure as he could assume. He guessed the Squire's errand in part; but the coward heart within him quailed before the possible. The Squire's first question set him at ease."], [232, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 220 'We find that Mrs Bromley has fled from her own home through the rain yesterday to take refuge in her son's deserted cottage ; and declines to assign a reason, or to return. Myself and family are too much concerned over our old friend's welfare to allow this state of things to exist unexplained, and, naturally, I have come to you for a solution.' ' Oh,' said Mr Bromley, wonderfully relieved to find his visitor knew so little, ' then she has not gone to Miss Power's ! Well, Squire, you seem to know more than I did. I can only remind you of her unfortunate propensity to explain anything strange or eccentric in her conduct. Yesterday, I happened to take a decanter out of her hand, and remonstrate with her on the disgrace her indulgence entailed upon us all, when she turned upon me, and said she would not stay here to be lectured for taking a few glasses of wine. There is the gist of the whole affair,' and he shrugged his shoulders as if there was no more to be said, and his verity was unquestionable. ' But I understand that Mrs Bromley was perfectly sober.' ' Now, Mr Stanfield, I put it to you, as a practical man, of unbiassed judgment, would"], [233, "Sorrows Unshared. 221 any woman in her sober senses rush off headlong through the rain, without money or clothes, from a comfortable house like this to shut herself up in a miserable pitman's cottage, with not a soul to wait upon her ? ' He held open the spread palms of his hand as he spoke, as if his argument was irrefragable, and as open. 'Suppose it so, Mr Bromley, would it not be as well if you endeavoured to persuade your wife to return, and, failing that, supplied her with the means to live ? ' suggested the kindly advocate. ' This house is open to her. She can come home whenever she pleases,' was Mr Bromley's reply. ' I shall certainly not countenance her objectionable freak by any allowance.' The Squire's intervention was a failure. The brand of inebriety had been made to serve a double purpose \u2014 to suggest a mental warp. On his way to the colliery, once more at work, Mr Stanfield called at the re-occupied cottage. He was not much more successful there. He found Mrs Bromley trying to amuse the boy Jerry in the absence of his mother ; sober enough, but persistent in her"], [234, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 222 refusal to return, or to explain away her strange conduct. ' Oh, do leave me alone, Mr Stanfield ! I would rather die than go back. He has got Mrs Bryant, and he has got the property. What more does he want ? I shall stay here until Clarence comes home.' Nothing more would she say. ' Poor woman ! I fear drink and jealousy between them have disturbed the balance of her mind,' he thought as he turned to go. ' Caroline will be greatly troubled about her old friend.' On his return to the Manor House, later in the day, Octavia drew him aside and showed him a large cameo brooch. ' See, papa, Nelly Saunders has been here to ask me what she should do about this brooch. Mrs Bromley had asked her to take it to Colborough for sale, and Nelly was afraid people might think she had stolen it. I do not know what it is worth, but I gave her ten pounds to take back as if it had been sold ; so that at any time it might be restored. Was that right, do you think ? You cannot imagine how my heart ached to find that our dear old friend was reduced to sell her trinkets for means"], [235, "Sorrows Unshared. 223 to live. It seems terrible, whatever is the cause.' The Squire frowned in perplexity. ' Yes, dear, you did quite right ; but that will not last long if, as Mr Bromley intimates, her mind is unhinged through drink. He is quite willing to take her back home and do the best he can with her. But he will not encourage her absurd folly by sending either her wardrobe or money to the cottage. And, if the case be as he states, I cannot blame him.' ' Pooh ! I would not believe a word he says. She was all right until she married him.' ' Yes, Octavia, but she did marry him. There must have been a screw loose somewhere when she did that, after rejecting Major Bathurst.' On the Sunday Mrs Bryant, calm and col lected, took her place in front of the organ, and played the congregation in with never a suggestion of a false note. Mr Bromley limped up the aisle and took his customary seat, but Mrs Bromley was conspicuously absent, and observers remarked that he appeared particularly nervous and flurried \u2014 sitting down when he should have stood up, and vice versa. After that there was no hushing-up Mrs"], [236, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 224 Bromley's flight from her own home, and the wildest stories became current. In the middle of the week, after a morning call on Mrs Stanfield and Octavia, Miss Sedg wick, straight of skirt and uncompromisingly stiff of spine, presented her card at Moorside House, and required to see Mr Bromley. She was shown into the library where he generally sat, and a very uncomfortable visitor he found her. She refused to be seated, and naturally compelled him to stand. There was no beating about the bush with her. She went straight to the point at once. ' I do not ask you, sir, by what fraudulent pretences ' (she saw him start and contract his brows) ' you persuaded Clarence Copeland's simple-minded widow to marry you, or what is the position of Mrs Bryant in this house ; but I require to learn by what vile arts, first the son and then the mother has been driven from their own home into the world whilst you revel in luxury here ?

They concern me as much or more than the"], [237, "Sorrows Unshared. 225 private affairs of my brother's clients concerned you, Nicholas Bromley, for Anne Copeland was my dear friend.' He shrank, his shifty eyes aA'oided hers, which seemed to pierce him through. He wondered how much she knew. ' I understand,' she went on, ' that she refuses to return to you. Well, she knows best. Doubtless she has her reasons, and may be safer and happier under the lowly roof than here. But that you should withhold her own wardrobe, and deny her suitable provision out of her own money, is a monstrous iniquity I will not permit.' ' You will not permit ? By what right, madam \u2014 ? ' he began to bluster. ' By the right of the strong to protect the weak. The right to sift the false from the true. Under which category should we find the credentials you presented to my brother Theobald, Mr Bromley ? She saw him wince, and followed up her advantage.

Where did you find the key to get at that grand secret ? You have admitted too much, sir.' ' I have admitted nothing. You have no witness to prove it,' he asserted with cool effrontery. ' No matter. You will have the goodness to provide suitably for the lady you deluded, or \u2014 I need say no more, Mr Bromley.' She let herself out of the room and the house as stiffly erect as she had entered. And Mrs Bryant found him quivering and cowering alike with baffled rage and terror, his own conscience having pointed and poisoned the arrows Miss Sedgwick had shot at random to find the joints in his armour. \u2014 His deepest iniquity she did not in the least suspect. 1 You have had an extremely agreeable visitor, I should imagine,' insinuated Mrs Bryant, with that peculiar smile and tone which irritated him like a whip of scorpions."], [239, "Sorrows Unshared. 227 ' You appear to have enjoyed the interview immensely! At all events, as if Miss Sedgwick had been a ' She who must be obeyed,' a supply of garments 'for immediate use,' selected with nice discrimination for fallen fortunes and cottage wear, found their way to Mrs Bromley, together with a sum of money \u2014 to her a miserable pittance \u2014 which she was advised not to misuse as no more would be forthcom ing for one calendar month, supposing her craze kept her from her proper home so long. ' So long ! I shall remain here until Clarence comes back, or until I die,' was her invariable answer to the few true friends who, misled by her silence, urged her to return to her own home. At first Miss Octavia and Miss Sedg wick endeavoured to penetrate the mystery of motive. A burning blush would overspread her face. She would strive to hide it in her hands. Her breast would heave with con vulsive sobs. ' Do not ask me. Do not torment me. I cannot tell you. You will know all when Clarence comes,' would break from her overwrought heart in gasps, and her friends ceased to question, not quite certain but"], [240, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 228 that Mr Bromley was partially correct, and that her mind was slightly unhinged. ' So long ! ' Weeks and months were trodden underfoot by time, but there she might still be found, as clear-headed and lady-like in the midst of her poor surroundings as when she was mistress of a mansion. One or other friend would have effected changes, but she objected. ' I promised Clarence that everything should remain as it was, and I must keep my word,' was her sole reply. She never went into the town, even to church ; but she might be met upon the moor with little Jerry toddling by her side gathering posies, whilst Nelly did such rough scrubbing as she held to be unfit for Mrs Bromley's de licate, white hands. All marketing was like wise done by capable Nelly, who certainly lost nothing by her good-nature, for although cash was scarce, baskets of fish, game, fruit and flowers found their way to poor Mrs Bromley of Copeland Cottages, however that same Mrs Bromley had been neglected at Moorside House ; and she was liberal to her less for tunate neighbours. She waited upon herself, prepared her own meals, kept her place in order, filled her spare"], [241, "Sorrows Unshared. 229 hours with needlework, amused herself with the gambols of Jerry, and made no complaints of dulness. Her sole anxiety was for news of Clarence, anxiety shared by Irene, no longer forbidden to visit his mother. Letters sent home by passing ships in the course of their voyage had reached them duly, and reported all well. But others, written after landing at Bahia, had been anything but re assuring. It appeared that their vessel, The Diamond, had narrowly escaped shipwreck on a dangerous part of the coast, where natives barely a month before had plundered the wrecked Prince of Wales, and murdered most of the crew. Clarence and his party had found Bahia all in a ferment in consequence of the British Consul's prompt action in the matter, and until England's attitude with respect to the outrage could be known, their own position was uncertain. They were desirous to proceed at once to their destination, the Valley of the Candista, but difficulties seemed to crop up in their efforts to obtain trustworthy guides and escort, or even the mules needed to carry them selves, their baggage and apparatus, difficulties accentuated by the strained diplomatic situation. Long before these letters were received, the"], [242, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 230 press at home had made the most of the ' Murderous outrage on British Seamen,' and the claims of the Government on Brazil. And although a hurried line to Irene, to say that the party was on the point of departure for the Candista and communication might be irregular, none of his friends were prepared for the utter blank which followed. The Braz ilians had refused to comply with British demands. Britain commenced reprisals, and in the midst of hostilities, months, nay, years, wore on without a line to set expectant hearts at rest. For Irene it was a doubly trying time. When letters ceased to come as usual, instead of the sympathy she might have expected, her father grew angry, and insisted that when Clarence left home in so discreditable a manner, with prospects so uncertain, it was his duty to release her from her childish engagement, and still more so when he went abroad for so long a period. He knew of a much better match for her. So, too, her godfather ; only he threw doubts on her lover's constancy, and contrived to draw her much into the society of his nephew, leaving time and association to do the rest. He pooh-poohed Miss Selina's"], [243, "Sorrows Unshared. 231 idea of Norman's prior attachment, and chuckled to himself when he saw the latter and Irene deep in conversation together, little wotting the subject. This had been conspicuously the case on the day of the Manor House fete to celebrate the re-opening of Stanmoor Pit and the ' winning ' of the first ton of good coal. The old man, leaning on his stick, had watched Irene, now flushed, now pale, strolling over the lawn with Norman, he with his head bent, both lost in confidential discourse ; and in his glee he called Octavia's attention to them, asking if she did not ' think them a very likely pair ? ' Looking for what he wished, he did not see Miss Stanfield's change of countenance, or detect the irony in her ' Very likely ! ' And neither he nor she knew that the pair were discussing the causes of Clarence Cope land's long silence, he promising to write to Morrison & Gilmour a second time to ascer tain what tidings, if any, they had of the expedition. But from that day forth Irene found Octavia less cordial and sustaining than of old.

Much of the sunshine faded from Irene's face as time strode on and the persecution of father and godfather became more pronounced, both insisting that Clarence was unfaithful, and that she should renounce him ; Octavia, mean while, becoming more lofty and self-contained ; when suddenly Highfield became convulsed by a catastrophe scarcely second to the flood ing of the coal pit, and lesser troubles were swallowed up in the social earthquake."], [245, "233 CHAPTER XV. IN THE HANDS OF JUSTICE. Christmas had for the second time set its cold foot on English soil since that memorable January when the bed of the Beck split open, and through its gaping mouth sent its clear waters down far and deep into the bowels of the darksome mine to work destruction. The Squire had had close on three years in which to drain the pit, recoup the cost, and once more work it profitably ; a contract with the Gas Company swelling receipts during the past half-year. It had somehow got noised abroad that there would be a goodly balance to divide between the partners that Christmas, and when Mrs Bromley was seen to cross the frosty moor from her cottage to the office near the main shaft, such of the old hands as were still employed knew Avell that she had gone to receive a large sum of money. But only Mr Kirk and Mr"], [246, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 234 Stanfield knew what sum she received, or what passed behind the closed door of the private office. She left it smiling. The Squire himself escorted her back to the cottage-gate, where Jerry ran to meet her, dressed in a little coat made out of an old gown of hers. She had talked of Clarence all the way. Hoping and longing for his return or for news of him, for dear Irene's sake as much as her own. She said if he did not come soon she should never see him. In the very middle of the night a half-dressed woman, with a plaid woollen shawl over her disordered hair, knocked and rang at Dr Elliott's door as if the town had been on fire. Though the new street lamps were econo mically extinguished at midnight, the red lamp over his door burned like a danger signal, and cast a strange light upon her pale face as Asaph opened the door. ' Why, Mrs Saunders, that's surely not you ? Anything wrong with Ben or the child ? ' he cried. ' Oh no, no ! Call the doctor up. Mrs Bromley has fallen out of bed, and has nigh killed herself. We heard her groaning, and"], [247, "In the Hands of Justice. 235 Ben had to break open the door to get in. Oh, do call the doctor. I've run every foot of the way. I left Ben holding her poor head on his knee \u2014 ' ' What's that ? ' questioned the doctor, coming on the scene. ' Mrs Bromley fallen out of bed, and hurt ? Where has she hurt herself?' ' Ben says its her head. And oh, she do groan awful. We are afraid, sir, she's dying.' ' I hope not,' said Dr Elliott, who by this time had his topcoat on, and a case of some kind in a pocket. ' Asaph, you had better follow, and bring \u2014 ' what \u2014 Nelly failed to understand, and in another minute the sturdy little man was striding on by her side, she half running to keep up with him, and shivering in the keen frosty air. ' You might be cold,' said the doctor, quick to observe. ' Well, sir, I could not stop to put anything but a skirt on, and it's cold coming out of one's warm bed.' ' To be sure, so it is,' he assented, adding after a pause, ' If Mrs Bromley is as bad as you say, you should have roused up her hus band, as you came, to let him know. ' I did, sir ; leastways they was not gone to"], [248, "236 The Slowly Grinding Mills. bed. The side gate was not fast, and a bright light streamed out of the kitchen door, and I smelled wood burning as that Mrs Bryant came to the top of the steps and asked what I wanted. She said as Mr Bromley was very ill and couldn't go, but that she would as soon as she got his bath ready.' ' Urn,' muttered the doctor, that comes of neglecting a sprain. He'll feel that hip of his as long as he lives, and it won't go better for all their coddling.' By that time Asaph was at their heels. Had Ben not been accustomed to cower upon his haunches in the pit, he could never have borne his cramped position so long ; for as Nelly left him in semi-gloom, which Mrs Bromley's shaded night-light did not dispel, so the doctor and Asaph found him with her poor injured head upon his knee. ' Her heid's a' wat,' said he as they entered, adding in a tone of horror, and almost dropping his burthen as the pocket-lantern (without which cautious Asaph never trod the moors at night) cast its rays upon them, ' Guid sakes, it's bluid ! ' 'Yes, blood, which, soaking through her crimsoned night-cap, had stained his trousers and his hand, and caused him to shrink aghast."], [249, "In the Hands of Justice. 237 There, too, in a like red pool upon the floor lay the round knob of his heavy kitchen poker, which he lifted with his wet hand and carried back to his own fireplace, while the doctor and Asaph gently raised the fallen woman to the bed from which she had fallen, and glanced expres sively at each other as, after Nelly brought a light and the matted hair was cut away, their examination was made. ' No fall has done this. The skull has been smashed in with a heavy blow from a loaded stick \u2014 ' ' Or a poker,' suggested Asaph. ' Exactly so,' agreed the doctor, in the same low tone, as he bent over their patient, and with his ready forceps lifted a portion of bone pressing on the brain. The poor creature's eyes opened and her lips moved. Mrs Bryant had come in unheard and un perceived by them, and clasped her hands as if in mute dismay. 'Hush, she is speaking!' and Asaph bent down his head to hear. 'He struck me down \u2014 like a \u2014 savage \u2014 ' There was a pause. 'How could he? How could he ? Her doing \u2014 her doing. How-"], [250, "238 The Slowly Grinding Mills. could \u2014 he ? And so at short intervals, between the low moans, a few broken and unintelligible words faintly parted her wan lips. Mrs Bryant stood at the foot of the four-post bed, with hands still clasped, eyes and ears strained, lips apart, and face blanched as with a great shock. But when no answer came from the dying woman to the doctor's repeated question ' Who did it ? except something that sounded like ' Clarence,' the watcher's rigid muscles relaxed, and she turned to the doctor to ask and volunteer explanations. Before Highfield had taken down its shutters and awakened to a fresh day's life, Mrs Bromley's flickering lamp was extinguished, and before weeping Nelly had well a chance to huddle on her clothes and dress Jerry, the police were in charge of the cottages \u2014 she and Ben were locked in the police-cell charged with \u2014 Murder! There was a secondary charge of Robbery, but the greater swallowed the lesser as the huge python so lately swallowed the living boa. The whole town stood aghast.

For certain it is that whether guilty or innocent"], [251, "In the Hands of Justice. 239 once let police suspicion cast its shadow on man or woman, guilt is assumed, and ' cor roborative evidence ' forthcoming. All poor Mrs Bromley's supposed aberrations and shortcomings were wiped from memory by her appalling death. The Rector and Major Bathurst, both on the Justice bench, were so horrified, that they were ready to sacrifice to the manes of their once beloved any victims the discriminating police brought before them. It was useless for Ben and Nelly to protest their innocence. Equally useless for the Squire to pronounce them incapable of so monstrous a deed, or to state that the whole sum received by Mrs Bromley for her own use and that of her son Clarence remained in his hands. Did not the ransacked drawers proclaim 'in tent,' and were not the red proofs before them indisputable ? Besides the stained poker, and the garments in which the accused collier stood, the police had ferreted out a short skirted velveteen coat on which were ominous spots, and a woman's white linen apron thrust out of sight as if to hide its crimson story. That Nelly had been the first to give the alarm was construed as hypocritical finesse.

Dazed and distracted the unhappy pair were relegated to the strong room to await the inquest.

' Dinna greet, hinny,' he said confidently, ' there's a guid God aboon us a', an' your ain faither wull tak tent o' the wee bit bairnie tull we win hame again.' But ' winning hame ' was no easy matter, and Ben had miscalculated the perversity of his wife's father, and his strange propensity for looking on the dark side of things. With him suspicion was as criminal as proven guilt. All his old prejudices and ob jections to Ben revived with redoubled force. He shrank from his innocent grandchild as if he were already branded a murderer's son, and bewailed Nelly's marriage as a foredoomed calamity. Had it not been for Nelly's sister, and for Miss Octavia, poor little Jerry would have fared badly at the lodge. As for the young lady, never had suspected criminals so staunch a friend. Not a word"], [253, "In the Hands of Justice. 241 would she hear of their possible guilt. No one was more shocked by the terrible deed, no one more saddened by the awful fate of her dear friend, but no one more persistent in her belief that two innocent persons had been captured whilst the actual perpetrator was still at large. She took gloomy Trench to task for pre judging his own daughter and her brave husband, rebuking him with withering scorn for his want of Christian love and charity, and denouncing his ready condemnation of his own kith and kin as more murderous in its influence on opinion than any act or deed of those he was so ready to suspect. ' It is impossible they could have done the treacherous and cruel deed. They are both as honest as daylight, and Ben is tender hearted as brave,' she urged ; with the adden dum, \u2014 ' I wish your heart was as kind. But remember, Jeremiah Trench, you \" had better have a millstone round your neck and be thrown into the sea,\" than misuse this little one,' and she patted Jerry's curly head as she gave her warning to his grandfather. Equally in earnest was she when, with a clear intimation to the Squire and Mrs Stan- VOL. III.

' Mph ! But, my dear young lady,' sug gested Theobald ; ' don't you think the Squire would prefer to give us these instructions ? ' ' Has he already done so ? ' 'No.' ' Then it is my duty. Nelly's mother gave her life for me. I am my own mistress, with means at command. I can use my inheritance for no better purpose than to preserve her child from cruel wrong.' ' I applaud your noble resolution,' then said Norman, with a like glow on his own face. ' I shall lose my faith in human nature and in physiognomy if either of those two be proved guilty. I never beheld two more genuinely open and good-natured countenances. And the man's own actions should place him beyond suspicion.' ' Ugh !

And circumstantial evidence has put a rope round many a wrong neck. But, never fear, Norman will do his best for your favourites, Miss Stanfield.' 'That I was quite sure of before I came. It Avill not be the first time he has defended the fallen pitman,' said she, with proud confidence, not lost on either man. ' Thank you, Miss Octavia ; I feel honoured by your confidence,' said Norman, whose coun tenance had not resumed its normal colour. ' I will at once go down to the police station, learn the presumed facts, and hear what ex planation the accused can give.' Then will you have the goodness to say that I have authorised you to act for them, and that I am certain of their innocence ? It may be some relief to their torture to know that someone has faith in them. Good-after- noon. She shook hands with both, and left the office, had a short conversation with Miss Selina, who was as excited as herself, and, leaving, found Norman on the doorstep, pre pared to walk with her down the street, so unusually alive with excited groups of people"], [256, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 244 discussing the awful tragedy in all phases of consternation. ' Perhaps it might be some satisfaction if I were to call at the Manor House, and, failing other informant, report results after I have seen these poor people (he did not say prisoners), and have made myself acquainted with the con dition and arrangements of the two cottages,' he said, possibly as an excuse for lingering. 'Oh, do, Mr Norman, I shall be most grate ful, and so will mamma. You cannot imagine the distress into which this terrible event has plunged us,' she responded with emotion. ' It would be slight service in a legal adviser to earn the gratitude of one so eager herself to befriend the unfortunate. Yet, believe me, no one is more solicitous than either my uncle or myself to prevent justice being perverted by popular clamour, to the sacrifice of the innocent. And I am wholly devoted to the cause I have undertaken. Miss Octavia's enthusiasm is con tagious,' he added, raising his hat as they parted company. ' I did well to secure his services in time,' she told herself, as she turned down the lane and saw the crowd round the blacksmith's shop, while Cowan, hammer in hand, demonstrated"], [257, "In the Hands of Justice. 245 how the fatal blow must have been dealt. ' The cause must indeed be hopeless that fails to succeed with so upright and zealous a champion.' Very simple was the explanation of the two poor prisoners. They had been awakened from sleep by some unusual noise in the next house, heard heavy groans, jumped out of bed. Ben slipped on his trousers and Nelly a skirt, and hurried to their neighbour's door, which they found locked. They knocked and called \u2014 got no response but groans. Nell ran for the poker, and with it Ben broke open the door. They were scared to find Mrs Bromley in her night-dress on the floor beside the bed, just as if she had got out and fallen. Ben dropped his poker and tried to lift her up, but she moaned so dreadfully that he just cowered down and rested her head upon his knee, while Nelly ran for Mr Bromley and the doctor. He never saw a sign of blood until Mr Asaph brought a light, and he found it on his hands and knees, and the head of the poker right in a pool of it on the floor. And it was not until Mr Asaph fetched the police that he thought anything had hurt her but a fall out of bed. For the stained apron Nelly accounted by say- ing that, on the previous Saturday, she had"], [258, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 246 bought a sheep's head in Colborough Market to make a haggis for Ben, and, being afraid to spoil the things she had in her basket, had whipped off her clean apron to wrap the head in. Being stained, she had stuffed it out of sight, and would have washed it with the week's clothes that very day but for what had happened. This was the unvarnished story also told before the Coroner, but it went for nothing in the face of medical testimony, that the death-blow had been given by just such a blunt instrument as Ben's blood-stained poker ; the ransacked drawers, and the victim's broken utterances indicating base ingratitude on the part of her murderer, and the conniv ance of a woman. The police could find no trace of other footprints, or other entrance ; but the ground outside was too frost-bound for such impressions. Someone had recognised the fine woollen shawl worn by Nellie as one belonging to Mrs Bromley, and Nellie's bare assertion that it came to her as a Christmas gift had no weight, or told against them. One of the jurymen created a sensation by asking why Mr Bromley was not present, but Mrs Bryant stepped forward and stated that he"], [259, "In the Hands of Justice. 247 was ill and unable to leave the house in con sequence of slipping on a loose stair-rod as he was on his way to bed on Monday night, and damaging his affected hip. And, Dr Elliott confirming the statement of injury, the captious juryman subsided. As might have been expected, the prisoners were committed to Colborough Gaol to await their trial at the Spring Assizes. Mrs Bryant left the court serenely as one who had performed an unpleasant duty, but without a second glance at the husband and wife, who clung to each other in speechless anguish and bewilderment as if struck by a thunderbolt, Doctor and police had pitched upon them as the obvious culprits, converting their humane acts into crime. Only one man had essayed to push inquiry into a different channel, and he had been silenced. Outside was a clamouring mob of pitmen and women who hailed the verdict with approving shouts, and language that made the two stunned wretches shrink and shudder. What had they done to set a whole community against them ? They had been high in favour with the colliery owners, had been set apart"], [260, "248 The Slowly Grinding Mills. even in their abode ; and the fresh band of colliers, who knew of no reasons for this favour, hated them accordingly. ' My dear papa, you must obtain me an order to see Nelly and her husband before they are re moved,' Miss Octavia had insisted, and though Lady Spencer objected, and the Squire at first demurred, it was obtained. It was as an angel of light coming to them in their darkness, for she carried with her an assurance that they were not deserted. She bade them not despair, for that everything money or skill could do to save them should be tried. She, moreover, comforted them with the promise that little Jerry should never want a friend so long as she lived. And she left grateful hearts behind. They had been visited by the good Curate in his capacity, and by Norman Sedgwick in his, but it had remained for Miss Octavia to restore their failing faith in the goodness of God. As if they had been smitten with leprosy, Trench had held himself sullenly aloof, pro claiming his intention to quit Highfield and hide his disgraced head among strangers, not forgetting to arrogate to himself the spirit of prophecy."], [261, "In the Hands of Justice. 249 The terrible shock of Mrs Bromley's awful end, coming on the top of loving Irene's dis tressing uncertainty about Clarence, and the petty persecution she had to bear on his account, culminated in a low fever, which kept the Rector and Miss Preston in a state of alarm and anxiety for many weeks, to the great uneasi ness of numerous friends, poor as well as rich. But never did Octavia Stanfield appear so much alive. Irene's illness only seemed a stimulant to her avowed purpose. ' We have got to prove Ben Saunders and his wife innocent, and it must be done,' she said. ' I do not believe in insurmountable obstacles,' and she allowed neither Norman nor herself to rest in inaction. The Colborough Messenger was not the only newspaper devoting columns with sensational headings to the ' Stanmoor Tragedy.' Half the papers in the country followed suit, and took the guilt of the Scotch pitman and his wife for granted. Octavia's righteous indignation Avas stirred. She wrote a long and vigorous letter to the Messenger, designed to dispel prejudice, and give the accused the chance of a fair trial, by proving the fallacy of circumstantial evidence,"], [262, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 250 and the incompatibility of such a crime as murder with the well-known characters of the prisoners. And she signed her letter 'Juslilia! It was answered the following week, with much force and some legal acumen, by someone styled ' Publicola,' who suggested that murder might not have been premeditated ; that the cupidity of the poor working man might have been aroused by the supposed wealth lying almost within reach, and, as ' opportunity makes the thief,' he had stolen barefooted on his neighbour's sleep for robbery only ; that, baffled and confronted by the awakened sleeper, he had struck at her to silence recognition, and had given an alarm to divert suspicion. The wife became an accessory after the fact. Their presence in the house with criminal intent would convert manslaughter into murder. And as ' the stars fought against Sisera,' so some adverse influence seemed to baffle all attempts of Norman and the Curate to establish a single fact in the prisoners' state ment. Not a butcher in Colborough market could remember Nelly or her purchase, though it was said to be a common practice with the pit-wives to wrap their meat in their aprons. The old clothes dealer might never"], [263, "In the Hands of Justice. 251 have existed. And though Norman had ob tained from Scotland noble testimony to Ben's heroism and filial piety, and they had retained Mr Gifford's nephew, a rising barrister, to de fend the prisoners on their trial, they failed to shake the facts presented by the prosecution. Ben's sobriety had made him enemies. Joe Spilsby, the ex-landlord of the Jolly Pitman, tendered his evidence that Saunders was a hot headed, quarrelsome fellow, always provoking his mates to fight. The Curate rose in court and speedily demolished him. But there was no one to answer Mr Steele when he re peated Ben's remark on the neAv poker. Mr Bromley had thought it well to appear to his subp\u0153na. He tottered into court with the aid of two sticks. His hair was grizzled, and he looked so undoubtedly ill, that a chair was found for his accommodation. He underwent a trying ordeal, but bore it with studied composure. Explained that Mrs Bromley had left her own home under the influence of liquor, and refused to return. He had been compelled to engage a housekeeper in consequence of her reckless extravagance. He had not gone to Mrs Bromley's assistance because he was dis abled. Mrs Saunders said she had fallen out"], [264, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 252 of bed, and he had concluded she had done so in a state of inebriety. Mrs Bryant had gone as soon as he had had his bath. Did not know of anything more serious until her return. Here a juror put a few disconcerting ques tions, ' How came the outer gate to be un fastened ? What was the distance between Moorside and the cottages ? What hour did they usually retire for the night ? How came a bright fire to be burning at midnight? What was the wood burning ? Where did the servants sleep ? ' all of which were answered seriatim without any stumbling. ' Probably the groom's carelessness.' 'About a mile.' 'The servants at ten, ourselves later.' 'To heat water for my bath.' ' Sticks to make the fire burn.' ' At the top of the house.' Tim was called. ' Was certain he had fastened the gate ? ' 'Well, thought he had.' 'Well, might have forgotten. He did sometimes.'

(Ben had pre viously said the spots were on the coat when bought second-hand.)"], [265, "In the Hands of Justice. 253 Testimony to good character was not wanting. Ben's old master, Sir Archibald Cameron, had come from Scotland to speak for him, and Squire Stanfield told of his descents into the flooded pit, and of the lives he had saved at the risk of his own. But the judge, who summed up somewhat on the lines of ' Publicola's ' letter, observed that previous character could not affect the sentence in a case of murder, however it might influence an after plea for mercy. Then the jury, after long absence, owing to the obstinacy of one crotchety juryman, came into court with a verdict of Guilty. The judge placed on his head the symbolic black square, called a cap, and passed the death-sentence in the customary form on both prisoners. There was another formality. A question was put to Nelly as a married Avoman, and answered in the affirmative. A jury of matrons was empanelled, and the female prisoner's execu tion was deferred until her child should be born. Let us drop a veil over the agony of the con demned. Could it be deeper than that of the actual criminal who walked abroad unsuspected ?"], [266, "254 CHAPTER XVI. TO BE HANGED OR NOT? In a private room engaged by Squire Stanfield, at the ' Wellington Hotel,' his daughter Octavia anxiously awaited the result of the trial. She had set her heart on the deliverance of two unoffending people, and could not rest at home. Colborough Gaol was not far away, and, from time to time, Herbert ran' in to report pro gress. When legal skill and forensic evidence had failed, and Norman, greatly dispirited, brought her the result of the trial, she was deeply moved ; she wrung her hands over what she called the 'Judicial Murder.' ' I would give all I possess,' she cried, ' to save those two lives and prove their innocence.' 'Would you give yourself, Miss Octavia?' burst involuntarily from Norman, thrown off his guard. She looked up suddenly into the clear depths"], [267, "To be Hanged or Not ? 255 of his earnest grey eyes ; her own fell before all she read there, and she spoke as if in a dream. ' The man who, at such a crisis, would head the forlorn hope for my sake would be worthy of my grave consideration. But he who would use his best endeavours to right the monstrous wrong, and win these two guiltless lives from the gallows for the sake of justice and humanity, would be worth more to me than my poor self.' ' Pardon me,' apologised Norman ; ' your rebuke is just. It is no hour to suffer private devotion to overpower a public duty. You are a noble, true-hearted woman, Miss Octavia, and I do not know any man worthy to mate with you.' He raised her hand to his lips with the re verence due to a superior. 'Yet, trust me,' he added, 'whatever human effort can accomplish at this eleventh hour, you may rely on.' ' I am convinced of that,' she said with appre ciative confidence.

There are hopes for Sir John yet. You have not lost much time, Mr Norman. I see you have already some important signa tures.' ' Yes ; but many more must be added before we start for London, and we cannot delay that later than the night train to-morrow, if we are to see the Home Secretary in time.' ' Are you going back to the court ? ' ' Certainly. I may be detained there until it rises. ' Then, pray, trust the petition to me.

He will do it and bear me company.' When the document was handed back to Norman, it bore the signatures of church dig nitaries, mayor, bankers, and several ladies \u2014 Octavia's with the rest. Her earnest faith in the condemned had been irresistible. Before the Stanfields drove home that night the petition had been endorsed by the Judge, the chief barristers on circuit, \u2014 and the dis satisfied juryman. The Squire had offered a seat to Norman \u2014 much to Lady Spencer's dis gust when she heard \u2014 and weary and sagged though he was with the strain on his energies throughout that peculiarly trying day, he almost forgot his fatigue in his proximity to Octavia, and the new hope rising in his breast.

Then he and he Rev. John drove far and fast to strengthen the petition with good county names. When the members of the deputation met on the Highfield platform that night, there was a third-class passenger added to their party. One of the young pitmen rescued by Ben ; the same who had protested against the risk of another descent. Norman had previously telegraphed to Mr Gifford, Avho had paved the way for their reception by the Home Secretary. The petition was laid before him, backed by the personal testimony of the Squire, and of Sir Archibald, who shook hands with the Secretary as an old acquaintance, and spoke of Ben as a good son, a faithful servant, and a"], [271, "To be Hanged or Not ? 259 hero, who had rescued his mates from a burning pit when none other Avould venture down. On this the pit-lad thrust in his word, unawed by the great man, and detailed with rude elo quence the conditions under which he had been dragged from death unto life, and others with him. The Secretary listened, said the case should be considered, but held out no hopes of a free pardon, as murder blotted out all records of former good deeds. Whereupon Norman, who had not pre viously spoken, ventured to say, \u2014 ' We are seeking more for a commutation of punishment, to give time to ferret out the actual murderer. A late pardon cannot un hang an innocent man.' ' You assume the innocence of these people ? ' Norman bowed ; and the deputation was dismissed. The Assizes were over. Nothing had been heard from the Home Office. Ben had been advised to prepare for execution on the Mon day morning, and the Rev.

' I'd rather die with thee, Ben, than live to leave behind a bairn born in a prison,' she cried more than once as the warders tore her clinging arms apart. All night there was an ominous hammering outside the gaol ; and in the morning light the black scaffold was surrounded by a surging crowd, eager to see a fellow-mortal strangled by law and to hear a last confession. Ben had no confession to make. The Curate by his side had the conviction that another and grosser murder was about to be perpetrated. The black cap already covered the man's face, the rope was being adjusted \u2014 there was a movement in the crowd, a shout, a man on horseback racing as for life \u2014 a paper waved in the air \u2014 Ben Saunders was reprieved. His sentence commuted to penal servitude forlife. The Curate took his arm to lead him from the scaffold, for he staggered like a drunken man. He was scarcely grateful. ' I'd as sooin ha' deeid right aff,' said he. ' Nay,' corrected the Curate, ' while there is life there is hope. You have friends who will never rest until the truth be brought to light. Have faith in God, and them.'"], [273, "To be Hanged or Not ? 261 The hope was as a ray of light to shine on the darkness of penal servitude. ' Now, Miss Octavia,' urged Norman, we have gained time.

' I will not,' he replied, pressing the hands he held ; ' but they must be turned in silence and in the dark.' 'If so, you have your reasons. I have per fect trust in them, and you.' She looked up, their eyes met once more, there was love as well as confidence in both, though no word of love was spoken, only her hands returned the pressure of his. What would Lady Spencer have said could she have entered her mother's drawing-room at that moment ?

It was last we had, and she put it in her apron, as she said she had been shopping for a lady, and was afraid to stain the things in her basket. I remember wondering what a Scotch haggis was like.'

And comments on their mourning garments, the whiteness of his hair, the peculiar smile upon her face, his ebony walking-stick, mingled with calculations on the few months since his other wife was laid in her grave, and the visible effect her murder had had upon him. Irene Preston, scarcely yet convalescent, watched the pair from her upstairs window, and wept to think of all the unhappy changes they had brought to pass.

And now those two strangers would reign at Moorside House, and call the Copeland estates their own, whilst her Clarence was a wanderer \u2014 per chance \u2014 but no, she would not regard him as dead. He would surely come back to her some day. Poor girl ! she had not much happiness to aid her recovery.

Close upon Mr Bromley's re-marriage tokens of retrenchment were observable. Servants left, and were not readily replaced. The new wife would not hire her maids. They must come on monthly tenure or not at all. Changes were frequent, and the establish ment was reduced. The double phaeton and pair were sold, and replaced by a low-basket carriage with a pony to suit, and in this Mrs Bromley Number Two drove her husband about for business or for health. Very shortly (about the time when Norman carried the two affidavits to London, and Mrs Saunders, in the prison infirmary, gave birth to a young infant Avhich died within the hour) these drives ceased altogether, and Mr Bromley was confined to his room with an obscure, colicky disease, which did not yield to treatment. If he had married again, as he gave out, for a nurse, his few visitors said he had done wisely, for his new wife was, if possible, more attentive and watchful than the dead one, and proved her self a thorough business woman, collecting rents, and dealing with tradespeople as firmly as Nicholas himself."], [278, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 266 Her post as organist she had surrendered immediately on her marriage, as incompatible with her new station and her wifely duties. This would have thrown the Rector and his Curate into a quandary, had not Jacob Pratt stepped into the breach and offered to \u2022take her place until someone more efficient could be engaged. And as it turned out that the able violinist had been practising at all hours, and had gone to Colborough for in struction on the new instrument, foreseeing some such collapse, no fresh appointment was made, and the responses were in future given by the well-drilled choir, and not solus by the parish clerk. He had gone to Colborough for something more than qualification as an organist. It was he who had unearthed the old-clothes dealer, a man who wandered about the country and was seldom seen in his own shop. But he had not felt compelled to confide that business to Martha. No sooner was the second affidavit secured than Norman was off to lay them both before the Home Secretary ; who with official caution remarked that ' the affidavits certainly put a new aspect on former evidence, and would have due consideration.'"], [279, "To be Hanged or Not ? 267 Norman had also a call to make for Irene. Messrs Morrison and Gilmore had just been favoured with letters from Brazil. Their party had had some unpleasant experiences with the hostile natives, but they were then at work and had discovered coal in sufficient quantities to justify further action, and were anxious for advices and news from home. Norman left their office, furnished with their address at the Candista. He had also business with Mr Gifford relative to his legal agency, and to the Gas Company ; and having settled these affairs satisfactorily, he began to question Mr Gifford on his own account, and was surprised and gratified to find the seal of silence broken at last. He began, \u2014 ' I have been much annoyed of late by a stranger's hints and inuendoes reflecting alike on the honour and integrity of my Uncle Theobald, as well as of my own father, which have caused me acute pain. Is our family history to remain a closed book for ever ? ' Mr Gifford smiled, played with his folded spectacles, and said, \u2014 ' I was empowered to open it, had you"], [280, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 268 questioned me when last in town. It is a long story, and I beg you will not lengthen it by interruptions. I need scarcely say that your Uncle Theobald and Horace Sedgwick were brothers, Theobald the elder. But you may not know that they were both in love with the same woman, Eleanor Norman.' ' My mother ! ' ejaculated Norman. ' Yes, in due time ; but she was previously engaged and attached to Theobald, and was only induced to break with him by a long course of foul chicanery. Horace was a skilful penman. Under pretence of devotion to her welfare, he laid before her a number of letters addressed to a woman as if from his brother, and some of the woman's letters in reply, all indicating a dishonourable connection, on the very eve of his marriage with Miss Norman. Pure minded and high spirited, she sent back Theobald's ring and presents and broke her engagement \"for reasons he must know full well.\" She refused to see him, had a long illness, and on convalescence gave her hand and her fortune to Horace. But that was not all. The Sedg wicks had a fine family estate then held by a bachelor uncle, to which Theobald was the acknowledged heir. A forged cheque, bearing"], [281, "To be Hanged or Not ? 269 the old gentleman's apparent signature, was presented to his bankers by a woman, and cashed. The body of the cheque was appar ently a clumsy imitation by Theobald. Horace made, himself hypocritically busy in the matter, the letters shown to Miss Norman were again produced to prove that the cheque was forged to support the woman's extravagance. Theo bald was disinherited and Horace installed, for the supposed baseness of his favourite nephew killed the old man before the wrong could be righted. ' At thirty years of age, Theobald Sedg- Avick carried his blighted name and his blighted hopes to Highfield, where he had friends who trusted him through all. And there he hoped to live down the odium cling ing to his name. There in a year or two he was hunted down by the woman to whom those letters had been written. Brought face to face in his office, she found in Theobald a stranger, and then it all came out. There were miniatures in those days, not photographs. She produced one in a locket. It was Horace. Horace who had personated him for his own base ends. Squire Stanfield was there and identified it. In a fury the woman vowed"], [282, "T he Slowly Grinding Mills. 270 to track him down. She did, and then your mother first became aware of her husband's perfidy. There was no more concealment of his dissipation, his gambling debts, the reckless waste of her property and his own. Your uncle would have prosecuted ; but for your mother's sake he spared his brother. You know the rest, and the life of struggle you had. Your dying father's confession cleared up the mystery of the disinheriting will.' ' I do not wonder that my ill-used uncle's temper grew sour and crabbed. He had much to bear.' ' Yes, but the kernel was not altogether hardened under the shell. Have you no sus picion who your unknown benefactor was ? ' ' Norman started to his feet. ' Surely not Uncle Theobald ! ' ' Yes, your Uncle Theobald. You owe everything to him and his undying love and reverence for your deluded mother \u2014 education, articles, eA'erything.' Norman was overpowered. He could only find voice to say, \u2014 ' Thank you, Mr Gifford, I shall no longer grope in the dark.' ' Uncle,' said Norman, when he got home,"], [283, "To be Hanged or Not ? 271 grasping the old man's hand with unusual warmth, ' I know the secret of your wrongs at last, and all the chivalry of your noble nature. You are an uncrowned hero. I owe you more than volumes of thanks, more than a son's devotion. What you have done for me I can never repay.' A queer smile flitted across the old man's face. ' Mph ! You could repay me fast enough, but you won't.' ' Don't say so. Try me.' ' Well, put up to Blossom. That will repay me.' Norman staggered as if struck. His face clouded. His voice fell. ' I cannot do that, uncle. It would be dis honourable. It would blight more lives than my own. Irene is not free, and I am bound heart and soul \u2014 and word, to another.' ' Mph ! That's your devotion ! Selina was right. What other?' was jerked out crossly and queerly. ' You will respect my confidence, I know, for the lady's sake. Miss Stanfield.'

' A tap at the door. In came Irene, her eyes sparkling, a roseleaf tint on her thin cheeks. Life had a new joy. Clarence was living ; Clarence was true ; his letter was in her hand ; she was bubbling over with her delightful neAvs. ' But oh, godpapa, they have had such a terrible time of it. Have had to fight for their lives. Have been imprisoned as spies. Have never had our letters or papers. And oh, he does not know about his poor dear mother. How am I to tell him ? It will break his heart.'"], [285, "To be Hanged or Not ? 271 The joyousness was gone. She looked the picture of distress. ' Hark you, Missie, that had better be left to the Squire, or to Norman here since he seems to be in your confidence.

Does he say when that is probable ? ' ' No. But he says he shall be glad to see Old England again. And you knoAv his contract expired in June.' 'Do not build too much on that, my dear,' cautioned the old man. ' Delays and contin gencies may have been provided for. You must not expect him until you hear again. Norman, will you open the door for Missie ? ' And with that Irene departed, not quite so elate as on her entrance. The Squire wrote and she wrote, and then they waited. Clarence had attained his deferred majority. He was de facto a partner in the colliery. There was a sum of money lying to his credit. There was a home for him at the Manor House until he made one for him himself. So said the Squire. VOL.

Indeed, the young lawyer had grown into favour with all the family \u2014 excepting Lady Spencer \u2014 since he had taken the Saunders' case in hand.

Norman was never more welcome than when he made known the remission of Nelly Saun ders's sentence, as the less guilty party ; and her freedom to quit the gaol, strength per mitting; although the Home Secretary had not seen fit to recommend the male prisoner to like mercy. Octavia sprang from her seat, and shook hands with Noman demonstratively, as if she could scarcely thank him sufficiently ; Mr Stan field and the Squire congratulating him scarcely less warmly. There was a touching scene in the Governor's house at Colborough Gaol the next morning, when Nelly, in her old garments, was brought \u2014 a free woman \u2014 into the presence of Miss Octavia, Miss Selina, and Norman Sedgwick. She looked from one to another in a dazed, stupid manner, as if unable to realise the fact of"], [288, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 274 her release. Her eyes roved wildly from one to another, then she dropped on her knees at Miss Octavia's feet, and covered her hands with kisses. ' Is it true, Miss ? Is it true I am at liberty, and am going to see my little Jerry ? ' she cried with pitiable doubt ; and being reassured, she sighed and said, ' But the bairn won't know his mammy now ; folk change so in a place like this.' She was indeed changed. Her cropped hair, her sunken eyes, now so wild ; her wan and haggard countenance, where deep hollows took the place of her rosy apple-cheeks, and matched the lines upon her brow, all told how anguish had done the work of years. And her friends saw the change through a mist of tears. ' Poor Nelly,' said Octavia, ' you are greatly altered, but you will freshen up when we get you to the seaside, with Jerry and your father and sister.' ' And Ben ? ' she asked, with a yearning quaver in her voice. ' Not at present,' put in Norman. ' One at a time you know. We are trying our best for him, but you will have to help us, and must get strong to be of use.'"], [289, "Ground to Powder. 275 ' Oh, sir, you are all very good to us. And I would lay my life down for Ben. And you know, sir, he didn't do it, he didn't really.' ' We are sure he did not, or you would not see us here,' was said in a chorus, and the Go\\'ernor blew his nose like a trumpet. She was invested in a respectable bonnet and shawl brought for her ; bade the Governor ' Good-bye ;' a fly in waiting carried her, as in a bewildering dream, to the railway station, along with her good friends, and before she had thoroughly realised her freedom, the train had landed them all at the quiet watering-place where Trench had set up as a gardener and florist by way of ' hiding his disgraced head.' The return of his daughter, accompanied, as he said, ' by three real gentlefolk,' was too much for the old man's severe stolidity. He fairly broke down and wept over her as he held her in his arms. As for Jerry, he stared at her, clung to his sister's skirts, and was not to be coaxed nearer. Presently she began to croon his evening lullaby, the chords of memory were struck, and he ran to her extended arms crying, Mammy, mammy.' Ostensibly Norman Sedgwick's sole errand to Seacliffe had been the restoration of poor"], [290, "276 The Slowly Grinding Mills. Nelly Saunders to her kin. But Trench had not buried himself in a solitude with never a friend to share it. Thomas Dean and Sally his wife were already in residence there, letting lodgings to visitors. And it so happened that the young lawyer had, ever since the day of the trial, had an untold interest in the master of Moorside House, and kept a ready ear open for any scrap of gossip concerning the Bromleys, which might float his way. So, under pretence of taking a stroll on the beach, he left the ladies at the cottage, and went peering about until, as if by chance, he knocked at Thomas Dean's door to inquire for apartments. Recognition and surprise were, of course, mutual. They were respectfully greedy for Highfield news, and were delighted to find a willing listener to the grievances which had driven them to throw up their situations and settle there. As may be supposed, their account of domestic affairs at Moorside House differed widely from Mr Bromley's, and threw a new light on many dark places. When he left he had engaged rooms for two ladies (who had not been consulted), paying a liberal sum in advance, and before the day was"], [291, "Ground to Powder. 277 over he had persuaded his Aunt Selina that it would be for the benefit of her health, and that of Miss Irene, if they occupied the rooms engaged. Miss Selina nodded, blinked wisely, consulted Brother Theobald and Miss Preston, and for the first time in many years left him to the care of Betty for a whole week. The musical evenings, which had fallen into abeyance after the bazaar, were resumed shortly after the memorable trial. The Curate and his sister were almost the only visitors at Moor side House, and Norman's sympathy with Mr Bromley's protracted illness, drew forth pass ing comments on the state of things there, which even Mr Saville pronounced 'peculiar.' The new wife was effusively polite and attentive to the invalid, but he had a vague idea Mr Bromley was half afraid of her. And she was always changing her servants. Dr Elliott, invited to take a hand at cards, or have a game at cribbage with Theobald in Miss Sedgwick's absence, was particularly communi cative over his game and glass. He sang her praises without stint. She was extremely polite, had always wine and cake for him before he visited his patient, and really gave him a better insight into the case than the patient"], [292, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 278 himself. He said Mr Bromley had grown very fanciful of late, particularly about his food. It was quite a trouble to the good lady. She was most particular in the nicety of its pre paration, and had dismissed more than one domestic on his account alone. From Asaph, whose acquaintance Norman had begun to cultivate, hints were heard of disagreements between himself and his master over Mr Bromley's disease, and the proper line of treatment, but with true medical reticence he forebore to specify either. And he did not say that he had advised the doctor not to take wine or cake until he had seen his patient ; a doctor wanted all his senses about him. Asaph was temperate like his father. But from none of these, and from none of Mrs Pratt's gossip about the change of servants, could Norman get at the clue he wanted. About a fortnight after Miss Selina and Irene returned from Seacliffe, a respectable servant-woman presented herself at the side en trance to Moorside House, and was confronted by the new Mrs Bromley. She said she had heard that a servant was wanted, and thought she would be able to give satisfaction, if the lady would kindly overlook her infirmity, and"], [293, "Ground to Powder. 279 she raised an aural trumpet to her ear for the reply. She was not, however, too deaf to catch the lady's sotto voce, 'Ah, just the thing.' She was invited into the kitchen by signs, and in answers to questions through the trumpet, said she had lost a very good husband, and a little child. That she still had a child to maintain, and that her infirmity stood in the way. She had lost her hearing through a great calamity, followed by severe illness, and her hair had been cut off at the same time. She was not afraid of work, and would engage for small wages if the lady would but try her. And she offered a written character from a Mrs Sarah Dean, who had known her nearly all her life, and could vouch for her good conduct. Her name was Ellen. The lady, Avho could scarcely have recog nised Nelly had she known her well, appeared perfectly satisfied, engaged her on the spot on a fair wage, giving her liberty to visit her child each week. Jerry was seen, and so was Norman Sedg wick, but not within range of Highfield. And now Norman became assured he was on the right track. Nelly's supposed deafness had put her new"], [294, "280 The Slowly Grinding Mills. mistress off her guard. Previous servants had only been admitted to the sick man's room in her presence. Nelly was allowed to carry up his tray and wait upon him, first leaving her trumpet downstairs. He suffered great agony, moaned and mut tered to himself. And she was sure there was something dreadful on his mind worse than the pain of his body. He had milk to drink, and had a milk diet. He insisted his food was gritty. If it was, the grit was in the salt or sugar kept upstairs. It did not go up in his sago or tapioca. Her mistress made the doctor be lieve he was half silly, because he complained, and because he cut the margins off his newspapers and rolled them up into spills. But Nelly had kept the dressing-room door ajar, and watched him when her mistress was out take a clean pen he had hidden about his chair, dip it into his glass of milk, and write as fast as he could on these strips, roll them up like tape or ribbon, and slip them into the lining of the old brown overcoat he wore.

He could not rise from his chair without his sticks, and hardly dared say his soul was his own. Sometimes Mr Bromley turned round on his wife, but she put him down with a few words. Nelly slept on the top floor alone, and was sent early to bed. But she crept down in the dark to watch and listen. One night she heard him say his wife was killing him by inches, and she retorted that he could not com plain of that. He was getting better measure than he had dealt. If he preferred hanging she could accommodate him with a word to the police. Then he said she was a fiend and a demon, and she answered that he had made her what she was. He often threatened to haunt her, and she laughed in his face and asked him if he was haunted. No, Nellie did not think the stair-rods could get loose ; they were so long and so firm. She had not seen the gold-headed cane anywhere, and she did not think Mr Bromley would last long; he was in great pain when she left. Norman heard much more than this, much that was irrelevant, but not all on one occasion."], [296, "282 The Slowly Grinding Mills. After the last communication made, when Mrs Saunders had been under the Bromley roof six weeks, he began to think it was time to take action, if ever, for though nothing absolutely connecting Bromley with the Stan more tragedy had been overheard, the indices were all in that direction. He would have to consult his uncle on the morrow about a search- warrant on suspicion. It was the middle of September. The people were flocking out of church after evening service. As he neared the school-house, he almost ran against Asaph Pratt. 'Oh, Mr Norman,' exclaimed he, ' I am glad to have met you here. Would you mind step ping into the surgery. I have something curious to show you. \u2014 I've locked it up lest anyone else should see it,' he added, as he un locked a tall desk and brought forth a book with a loose wash-leather cover, half burnt as it were. ' See,' he said, ' that is the Latin Dic tionary Mr Bromley gave me when he got married.

By his advice I kept silent, and submitted the dis covery to you.' With the valuable book in his hand, neatly folded up by Asaph, Norman left the surgery. As he rounded the school-house he encountered the Curate, and told of Tim's errand. ' Really that is very sudden, though he has been seriously ill for several months. I fear he had something heavy on his \u2014 stay, I may not be too late.' The Curate darted back into the vestry as he spoke, came back carrying a small sacred case, and rushed off the way the doctor had taken, with merely a farewell nod to Norman. Medicine for body and for soul were alike too late. Nicholas Bromley had gone to his account unhouseled, unaneled.

She said, with an attempt to smile, that she fancied she saw him sitting in his chair, in his old brown coat, as usual. ' I shall get rid of that old coat,' she added ; ' it holds too many memories.' Nelly had her trumpet to her ear. She grasped her opportunity. ' Hegh, ma'am, I wish you would give it to me.

There had been some serious matters dis cussed in the lawyer's office that week, in which the Latin Dictionary played a consider able part. Nelly's revelations and Norman's suspicions adding to the complexity. The Squire had been called to the conference as the guardian of Clarence Copeland ; since it be came apparent that Mrs Copeland had been fraudulently married by Nicholas Bryant under the assumed name of Bromley, during the life time of his legal wife, Harriett, and that the heir had been feloniously dispossessed. The man had slipped out of life before the greater crime of murder could be brought home to him, and seeing that the Squire's guardianship had ceased the previous March, there came the legal difficulty of a prosecutor in the absence of Clarence, supposing the first marriage proven. And they were no nearer the liberation of Ben Saunders. ' There's a will for you, Uncle,' cried Norman,"], [303, "Ground to Powder. 289 laying it open before him. ' Do you not call that a refinement of malice ? The will-maker knew well that legal rights have to be proved, and that legally he possessed nothing of all he had usurped. His appointment of me as ex ecutor proclaims his desire to dispossess his widow.' ' It looks like it,' assented Theobald. ' Bromley was a crafty fellow.' In a couple of days came Mrs Saunders, sorely worn out with waiting and watching for her Ben's deliverance, which seemed to come no nearer, though she brought it with her in an old topcoat and a rickety arm-chair, which a pit lad carried for her. Little wotting what she had left behind, Nelly went off to see her boy at Seacliffe, longing to be freed from her irksome servitude, whilst Mr John Reid went tearing down the street for Squire Stanfield, and the office boy to the doctor's for Mr Asaph Pratt.

I took possession, ousting Clarence Cope- land, the true heir. But I had cheated myself. He had an inheritance I could not touch. Fool ! I envied the boy this. Highfield society ignored me, I made myself use- ful and conspicuous. My God ! it brought that subtle fiend, Harriet, down upon me at a bazaar. The shock prostrated me. She wrote to me, she waylaid me when barely convalescent. She taunted, threatened. She had me in her power. I could no longer fly. I was crippled, and a coward. \u2014 Oh, that I had taken warning the night I fell and hurt my hip ! It was a fatal fall. I was prosperous, but had no peace. Then that demon worked her way into my house, drugged my dear angel Anna, spread reports that she drank \u2014 and I \u2014 I dared not interfere. She held the whip of my crimes over me. She held me in thrall as she holds me still \u2014 and she is killing me \u2014 slowly. \u2014 She drove the young heir from home to a foreign land \u2014 or I did it under her goad. And then, curse her \u2014 she threw my father's letter in Anna's way, the letter folded in this. Shall I ever forget the anguish of that hour? My pure-souled Anna's agony of shame, her convulsive sobs, her appeals from me to Heaven, her horror-struck flight from her own home, where she was a wife only in name. Poor woman, she knew not her own power to dispossess me, or she was ashamed to confess her position to her best friends. Did I know one hour's peace after that ? She who had fled for refuge to a pitman's cot was happier far than I. I was brayed in a mortar that has ground me to powder. Months fled. I was constantly reminded that Anna had carried with her the fatal letter, that when her son returned, it would"], [307, "Ground to Powder. 293 dethrone me. God forgive me, miserable wretch that I am. In an evil hour, like a thief in the night, I stole out, I opened the door of her cottage with a duplicate key. There was a light burning. I ransacked her drawers, possessed myself of the letter, and turning, found her watch ing me. \" Liar and thief ! \" see said, springing out of bed, as I was sneaking off. My cane was in my hand. I know not how it was, but I struck at her, and she fell, the gold knob was heavy. I fled, locking the door behind me, but her moans, her horror-struck eyes, seemed to follow me. In spite of my limp I almost ran. Near home I tripped over a stone and fell. Fear brought me to my feet. I got in at the yard gate somehow. Forgot to close it behind me. Shall I ever forget the fiendish face that greeted me. There were blood-spots on my face and on my coat, on my cane. She thrust this in the fire and burned it down to the knob. \" I shall keep this as a memorial,\" said she. I sat there by the fire, shuddering with pain and terror, my hands and face unwashed. A hurried step came up the yard. A good woman to say my wife had fallen out of bed, was dying \u2014 would I come. She was not admitted. Harriet met her at the door with a lie upon her lips, said I was having a bath. But why linger ? That woman and her compassionate husband were condemned for the murder I had done, and I \u2014 coward, traitor ! \u2014 went into the witness-box to swear away their lives. They have haunted me eA-er since. I see the face of Nelly Saunders in the deaf servant who waits upon me. I would confess and end this mortal agony, but my fiendish wife never leaves me one minute with curate or doctor. God pardon me, I suffer the torments ot the damned already. The tiger cat is preparing for a final spring. May retribution find her swiftly. The will she forced from me will avenge me. Nicholas Bryant.

There was another deputation to the Home Office with a statement and fair copy of this confession, and the letter. Norman and the Squire bearing with them the originals and the old overcoat as evidence. Officialism cannot work without red tape. There was not much wasted before Benjamin Saunders, pitman, was mercifully accorded a Free Pardon for a crime he had not com mitted.

Mrs Pratt was on her doorstone. ' Have you heard the news ? ' said she. ' Mr Copeland has come home.' There was quite a crowd round Theobald Sedgwick's door, and another inside the par lour, where a bronzed and bearded fellow as big as Norman himself stood with one arm round the blushing and tearful Irene, en deavouring to answer half-a-dozen questions at once, and to grasp as many proffered hands. His first call had been at the Rectory. There he had heard she was at her godfather's, and as soon as he could free himself from the inquisi torial Rector, he had hurried thither to take a quiet tea-party by surprise, and be welcomed by a host of his best friends.

Presently in came the Rector, and was followed by the Curate and his sister, and then Theobald himself, who was brilliant and beaming in spite of his failure in match making, suggested an adjournment to the draw ing-room above, where there might be breath ing space ; and there Clarence gave an ac count of his adventures, for which there is no space here. Before the Squire's letter, or Irene's had reached him, he had come across an English newspaper, and in the report of a trial for mur der his mother's awful death had been made known, and filled him with horror and distress. He was offered inducements to remain, but that report hastened his return, to see justice done if possible, for only his stepfather could have done so foul a deed. Mr Saville was astonished.

She stood dumbfounded as she read. She had made her position so sure. Her scheme of vengeance had been carried out to its last item.

So there was a new danger in the air ! Yet she would not be empty handed. She smiled over her private banking account. She col lected scrip, coupons, jewellery, anything she could convert, and packed them into a small portmanteau. At the edge of dusk she drove her basket carriage to the railway station, not through the toAvn, where danger lurked, but over the broken moor and intersecting tram-lines. What mat tered injury to the wheels or carriage ! She would need them never more ; she only cared to be in time for the train.
