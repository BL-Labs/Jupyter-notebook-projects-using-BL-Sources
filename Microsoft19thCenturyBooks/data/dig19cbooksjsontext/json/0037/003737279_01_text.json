In the inner room of a small, dimly lighted house, half hidden behind the dark walls of the arsenal of Stuttgart, a group of three men were occupied in loading a pistol. They were seated at a small deal table which stood at the far end of the room from the door. On the table was a small open lamp, and the dirty yellow flame which struggled upwards from its untrimmed wick flared upon the faces of the three, and brought them into pallid relief against the surrounding shadow. As the sickly light wandered off into the corners of the bare, gloomy room, it revealed the obscure form of a fourth man, younger than any of the first three, who sat by himself on a bench next to the door. The group engaged in loading the pistol were pro ceeding with strange formality. Absorbed in their task, they took no notice of their comrade, who watched them <6"], [14, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 2 with brooding eyes as they bent their heads together across the table, or spoke to each other in low whispers from time to time. Once or twice he turned his head and gazed abstractedly at the door. It was locked ; and the high, narrow window at the opposite end of the chamber was closely shuttered and barred. The leader of the party, a man whose grey hairs and deeply wrinkled face showed him to be by many years the eldest of the four, had commenced the ceremony by opening a small wooden case which lay on the table between the three, and taking out the pistol, which he first carefully examined, and then handed silently to the man seated next to him. This man, a burly giant, with tremendous red whiskers and beard, in which his face was almost concealed, caught at the pistol with a grunt of satisfaction. In his huge grasp the weapon looked like a toy, as he held it up to the light, glanced down the barrel, and snapped the trigger. At this sound the youth by the door started ever so slightly. Then the red-bearded giant passed on the pistol to the last of the three. \"Here, Johann,\" he remarked in low tones, '\"see if you can find an) thing wrong with it.\" The man addressed as Johann, who was much younger than either of his companions, received the pistol in silence, as silently turned it over, and passed it back to the old man. The pistol was of old-fashioned make, and had but a single barrel. It was only meant to fire one shot. While the others were handling it, the leader had gone on with his preparations. From the same wooden"], [15, "PROLOGUE. 3 case he had taken out a small powder-flask, a wad, a short steel ramrod, and a bullet. To these he added an ordinary percussion cap, and last of all came a bar of black sealing-wax, and a curious narrow stick tipped with a steel button, on which a cipher of some kind appeared to be engraved. Having ranged these articles on the table before him self and his comrades, the old man received back the pistol, and proceeded to load it at the muzzle from the powder-flask. Slowly the stream of black salt trickled out, sprinkling its course with tiny sparks of light, as the sharp-edged particles caught and flashed back the glow from the sputtering lamp. Then the weapon again changed hands, and the man with the red beard fitted in the wad, and vigorously rammed it home. This done, he handed the pistol again to Johann, with the whispered exclamation, \" Now for the sugar-plum ! \" His younger comrade took it from him as quietly as before, dropped in the bullet, and returned the weapon once more to the senior of the three. All this time the young man by the door had neither moved nor spoken. A faint shiver which passed through his frame when the bullet tinkled against the edge of the barrel alone told that he was keenly alive to what was going forward. Now came the remarkable part of the ceremony. As soon as the old man got possession of the pistol for the third time, he rose solemnly to his feet, and taking up the bar of sealing-wax, ignited it over the naked flame of the lamp. As the wax hissed and flared up, he brought it directly over the upright muzzle of the pistol,"], [16, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 4 allowing the burning drops to fall right down the barrel. The next moment he dropped the bar of sealing-wax, and seizing the narrow rod already described, plunged it down the barrel, and sealed the bullet firmly in its place. The giant, who had watched this operation with the closest attention, now took the pistol once more, and completed the work of preparation by fitting on the percussion-cap, over which he allowed the hammer to close down. All being ready, Johann received the loaded weapon in his hands, while the fourth member of the party rose from his seat beside the door, and advanced at a given signal towards the others. \"Don't be afraid, Karl,\" said the big man good naturedly, as he caught sight of his young comrade's face. \" The pistol has not been loaded for you.\" The two others frowned at this remark, and the elder man held up his hand in rebuke. \"Hush! Our brother is right to feel afraid\u2014 afraid lest the sealed bullet should fail to reach its mark.\" And he thoughtfully scanned the young man's features, now looking almost livid in the wan glow of the lamp. Meanwhile the other young man had risen to his feet. Holding the mysterious weapon in his hand, he put the following question to his comrade : \u2014 \" Brother, the lot has chosen you to fire this pistol. Are you ready to take it, and carry out the instructions you will receive ? \" \" I am,\" came in husky tones from the youth. He put out a shaking hand, and received the pistol from Johann."], [17, "PROLOGUE. 5 Then the elder man pulled out a drawer in the table, took out a piece of paper, wrote on it a single word of seven letters, and handed it to the man with the red beard. He glanced at it amid a dead silence, nodded his head, and passed it on to Johann, who by this time had sat down again. He read the word with a grim smile, and returned the paper to the leader of the party. The old man solemnly folded up the paper, sealed it with the cipher already used for the bullet, and placed it in the hands ofthe giant. It was now his turn to rise and address the agitated Karl. \" Here are your instructions. Do you undertake to return here, if you are alive and free, at the end of three months, and give an account of your mission ? \" \"I do.\" This time it was little more than a hoarse whisper which came from the young man. The others appeared satisfied. The old man arose, and moving out from behind the table, went up to the youth and gave him a solemn embrace. The good-natured giant followed, and took advantage of the opportunity to whisper in his comrade's ear \u2014 \" Keep up a good heart, my boy ; and if you want help, rely on us.\" Then Johann made a step forward, but stopped short. He was interrupted by an unexpected sound, The noise of hurrying feet was heard in the passage"], [18, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 6 outside, and was instantly followed by a succession of low distinct taps on the bottom panel of the door. The four men simultaneously raised their heads and exchanged glances of inquiry and alarm. Only on the face of one of them, he who held the sealed weapon beneath his dress, was the look of dread chequered by a faint expression of relief. The next moment Johann moved towards the door. II.\u2014 THE SEALED INSTRUCTIONS. The word written inside the sealed paper was a name. The name was Leopold. Who was this Leopold \u2014 and for what cause had his name come to figure so ominously in those surroundings ? To-day he is forgotten ; the whole of Europe rang then with the name of Leopold IX., the wicked King of Franconia. A few words as to this personage will serve to throw light on the more recent events with which this story is concerned. The race from which he sprang has long held an evil renown upon the Continent. For more than a century a dark cloud has overshadowed the royal line of Astolf. A mysterious taint in the blood has broken out time after time in the Franconian princes, betraying itself in wild freaks and excesses, which are rather whispered of than named. A monotonous chronicle of madness and crime makes up the gloomy annals of the House."], [19, "PROLOGUE. 7 Something of this doubtless has been due to the peculiar character of their sovereignty. While smaller kingdoms, with narrower resources, have played an independent part on the European stage, Franconia, hampered by its position in the great Germanic body, has remained a petty State, compelled to be a mere satellite in the train of one of the two great monarchies which have contended for the dominion of Germany. To-day, closely enswathed in the iron bonds of Prussia's military empire, the Franconian kingdom has ceased to have an international existence. In the eyes of diplomacy she is no better than a province of the Kaiser's dominions, and in the council of nations her voice is no longer heard. Yet within their own borders the Kings of Franconia continue to be supreme. Deprived of their authority in the great questions of peace and war, in all matters of internal interest they rule their kingdom with an independent sway. It would even seem as though the peculiar relations between them and the Imperial Government had added to the security of their throne. It would require no ordinary degree of misgovernment to provoke a rebellion whose success must mean the extinction of Franconian nationality, and its final sub jection to the formidable Prussian yoke. Their situation resembles that of those satraps who reign with absolute power over the provinces of Oriental empires. The difference is that they are irremovable, and hand on their dominion to their heirs. To the intoxication of despotism add the intoxication of security. The strongest brain will reel under such"], [20, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 8 pressure. History recalls the line of maniacs who slew and wantoned in Imperial Rome. In modern Europe a bloodthirsty despot has become an impossibility. A king no longer dares to kill his subjects for the pleasure of it. All that has been put an end to by a glorious invention of the physicians. They have invented the word monomania, a tremendous exorcism, the mere utterance of which reduces the most powerful monarch to impotence, scares awayhis courtiers, paralyzes the arms of his guards, and tears him from his throne to bury him behind iron doors. It was with this spell that their bewildered subjects had fought the kings of Franconia for the last two generations. There was only one man in the kingdom more powerful than the monarch. This was the Court physician. He glided in and out among the brightly dressed throng of courtiers, wrapped in his black cloak, with his finger on his lips, and watched everything. It was like the mummy at the Egyptian feast, only more terrible, as if it had been a mummy which might at any instant start to life, and bid the giver of the feast take its place in the sarcophagus. , When the time came, the physician unclosed his lips and pronounced the fatal word. Then the king dis appeared silently from view, and a new ruler took his place. This was the new Vehmgericht. Like the ancient Venetian doges, the kings of Franconia walked everywhere, surrounded by an atmo sphere of mysterious dread. Secret eyes were upon"], [21, "PROLOGUE. 9 them always. Oubliettes were prepared under their feet, into which they never knew the moment when they might not be cast. And from these oubliettes there was no chance of escape. The dooms of science are more relentless than the dooms of superstition. In the bosom of a Grand Inquisitor there might lurk mercy as much as a grain of mustard seed. Mercy is a word which science is unable to comprehend. Its judgments are merely con clusions. Mathematical reasoning cannot be bent aside by emotional considerations. Leopold IX. was the worst king of this line. This was because he was the most sane. He was selfish, ignorant, utterly heartless, grasping, cruel, lustful, a glutton, and a bad son and father. But he was neither a drunkard nor a spendthrift. To such a man science had nothing to say. The secret in quisitor was powerless. Leopold IX. had broken the curse. He was too much like the average man to be mad. His younger brother Otto had been an easier victim. Within a year of his marriage with the beautiful Hermengarde of Schwerin-Strelitz, he had disappeared. Men whispered that the stately, cold-looking bride had given her approval to this consummation. Be that as it may, Otto passed the years till his death plaiting straw, like many another of the Astolf princes. Some of them plaited crowns ; they were light and easy to wear. Leopold reigned on. His people had to suffer a great deal. A few of his exploits are on record."], [22, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 10 A jeweller in the capital had made his fortune. He was getting old, and meant to retire. The last trans action he undertook was a heavy purchase of diamonds. The stones were lying in his safe, when one night a troop of masked burglars broke in and carried off everything. The police of the capital were under the royal control, and on this particular night they had left that quarter of the city deserted. The robbers got off in perfect safety, and the old jeweller was ruined. Shortly afterwards he left the city. It was rumoured that he had retired to Stuttgart. A sergeant in the royal bodyguard had been im prisoned for a few months, and then banished, shortly before this event. This punishment had been awarded for certain angry expressions which he had been heard to use about his royal master. The fellow had been let off lightly, as his mind was supposed to be affected by a family trouble. His daughter, a very beautiful young girl, had taken her own life and that of her unborn infant. The name of its father had not transpired. This sergeant was a man remarkable for his size and for the redness of his beard. Riding out in the royal park one day, Leopold met a forester's boy, a lad of seventeen. He gave him a cut across the face with his whip, which drew blood. This boy, too, had not been seen for some time. His name was Karl Fink. Leopold had a wise dread of education. The schools which he found existing in his kingdom he would have put down if he dared. His anger was roused when he learned that some of the young artisans in his capital"], [23, "PROLOGUE. 11 had started night classes in which they studied draughts manship, mathematics, and engineering. He ordered his police to break up these schools, and prosecute the ringleaders of the movement. They were afterwards discharged, but those of them who were still bent on acquiring knowledge had to turn their steps abroad. The chief of these young men was one Johann Mark, a journeyman printer. Of late Leopold had begun to show himself more cruel. His own son Maximilian, it was said, had to endure a good deal at his father's hands. Maximilian was a shy, delicate youth, with a passion for art and music. He resembled his mother, a gentle princess of Spanish birth, who was commonly believed to have died of a broken heart. Some there were who spoke of direct acts of violence, but history cannot dwell on the gossip of chamberwomen. Leopold had sought a fresh alliance abroad without success, and was now living in morganatic relations with an ugly countess of fifty. She was the only person in his dominions who was not afraid of him. It was known that she exerted her influence with his father on behalf of Maximilian, and saved him from much ill-usage. Very likely she did this with an eye to her suture interest. Maximilian thought it was sheer good nature, and liked the woman. Leopold hated her. For the rest he was a short, squat man, with a red face, and prominent eyes like marbles, of some colour between blue and green ; and he had a habit, when"], [24, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 12 excited, of pressing his forefinger lengthways against his upper lip. He was forty-eight years of age, and had reigned since he was twenty-nine. III. \u2014 THE FIRING OF THE PISTOL. Johann stepped cautiously towards the door. Arrived before the keyhole, he put his eye to it. All was dark outside. \" Who are you ? \" he whispered after a moment's pause. The answer came also in a whisper. It seemed to satisfy him. Nodding to his comrades inside to signify that all was right, he quietly unlocked the door. The man who entered was not a particularly striking figure in himself, but there was that in his appearance which instantly aroused the interest of the four inmates of the room, and caused them to gather eagerly around him. His clothes were disordered, his face was flushed and bedewed with perspiration, and his short, quick breaths bore witness to the exertion he had made in getting there. But it was not this which arrested the attention of the others. They perceived a nervous excitement in his bearing, and an eager light in his eye, which warned them that he was the bearer of extraordinary tidings. His first act on entering was to look round and number with a glance the men who stood inside. This done, a sigh of relief escaped him."], [25, "PROLOGUE. 13 \" Thank Heaven, I am in time ! \" he exclaimed. \" Why, what is it ? \" demanded the old man. The new-comer dropped on to the bench beside the door before answering. Then, assuming a more solemn expression, he said in impressive tones \u2014 \"Your work has been done. This morning King Leopold went mad and cut his throat. He died at noon.\" As soon as he had finished speaking the young man who had been entrusted with the sealed weapon gave a loud cry, and tottered as though he would fall. The giant rushed to his assistance, and, taking the pistol from his nerveless clasp, handed it to the leader. He took it, and pointed it downwards. \" You have spoken truth,\" he said gravely. \" God has done our work.\" And he fired the pistol. He was about to throw away the smoking weapon when Johann stepped forward and laid his hand upon it. \" Stay. It may be wanted yet,\" he observed quietly. \" For whom ? \" the old man asked, with astonishment. \" For Maximilian.\" The other four men recoiled. Half an hour after the house was empty. The comrades had dispersed, some of them never to meet again."], [26, "14 CHAPTER I. THE GARDEN OF EDEN. \"Can you see him, father?\" The old forester looked round, and saw his daughter coming down the narrow path, bordered with dwarf apple trees, which led from the front door of the cottage to the garden gate. Answering by a slight shake of the head, he turned round again, and leant over the gate, resuming his occupation of drawing long slow puffs at a huge pipe which he held in one hand. The pipe had a long cherry wood stem, ending in a deep china bowl, which was capped with a lid of copper. From the holes in this lid came thin blue spirals of smoke, which floated away till they were lost to view against the green background of forest. Dorothea ran forward lightly, her white muslin skirts just touching the espaliers as she passed, and, coming up to the gate, leant over it beside her father. She rested her soft cheek against his arm, and gazed with dreamy eyes at the smoke-rings, trying to follow them till they dissolved in the surrounding atmosphere."], [27, "THE GARDEN OF EDEN. 15 The summer heat lay like a film over the afternoon. The hush of the landscape was not even disturbed by the call of a bird or the dry chirp of a cricket. In front of the gateway at which they stood stretched a clear space of rolling turf for one or two hundred paces, at the end of which the grass began to go out of sight beneath short undergrowth and scattered trees, the fringe of a stately woodland. To the right and left of the forester's lodge the trees gathered in again. Behind, it was approached by a footpath over a widening tract of fields, a tongue of meadow-land thrust into the forest. Far away over the fields, had they looked, rose the faint tower of a church and the signs of a peopled land. \"It is more than two months since he first began coming here,\" murmured the young girl, presently. \" I wonder who he can be ? \" The forester turned his head and smiled, as though there were something in his daughter's words which caused him secret amusement. Then he took another deep puff at his pipe, and answered \u2014 \" It is best not to ask. If he wished us to know he would tell us himself. Take care to please him, without being too curious.\" \" I know he comes from the Castle, so he must be one of the gentlemen of the Court,\" said Dorothea, speaking slowly, as if to herself. \" Who knows ? perhaps he is a count.\" As she uttered the word Castle, she raised her eyes, and turned them on an opening in the forest in front, between which and the cottage gate there ran a beaten path. For, a mile and more away through that forest,"], [28, "16 A CROWN OF STRAW. there rose the royal castle of Neustadt ; and old Franz Gitten was a forester in the service of King Maximilian. This time Franz spoke more roughly, as if ill pleased with Dorothea's words. \" It is no business of ours who he is. As long as he likes to come here and drink our cider he is welcome. I tell you not to trouble your head about it.\" Checked in this direction, the girl let a few minutes pass before speaking again. \" I wonder why he comes here so often,\" was her next remark. \" Surely the wines at the Castle must be better than our cider.\" Again the forester smiled to himself, as he went on smoking without any response. Dorothea continued \u2014 \" The King is at Neustadt now. Will you take me over, some time, father ? I have never seen the King.\" Old Franz interrupted her. He raised himself up, with a grunt of satisfaction, and stood looking at the opening in the wood. Dorothea followed the direction of his glance, and uttered an exclamation. Two men had just emerged from the forest, and were walking through the sheet of sunlight towards the forester's lodge. The ages of these two men differed by a good many years. The elder of the two was a man of over forty, tall, with auburn hair, and restless eyes which glanced perpetually from side to side as he walked alon\u00b0\\ His dress was easy \u2014 a knickerbocker suit of brown velveteen with a loose open collar, and crimson tie, and a hat of"], [29, "THE GARDEN OF EDEN. 17 soft black felt with a wide brim. This brim he pulled down over his face as soon as the sunlight struck upon it, and thus partly screened his features from the curious gaze of Dorothea. \" Whom is he bringing with him ? \" she whispered to her father. \"This is the first time he has not come alone.\" The forester took no notice of the question. His attention, after the first brief look, was engaged by the other of the two companions. In itself the younger man's figure was not striking. He was short, and yet too slender for symmetry. It was his face which aroused interest, and, with the long straight nose and pointed chin, conveyed the curious suggestion of a younger and handsomer Don Quixote. The delicate contour of the features was like a woman's, and there was something at once strange and fascinating in the colour of the eyes, which glowed in the bright sunshine with that pale green flame only seen in the field of a rich sunset or in the hollow of certain shells of the Indian seas. But an almost uncanny note was that struck by the young man's costume. He wore a close-sitting suit of a shade of green exactly matching the grass across which he was walking, so that it was nearly as difficult for the eye to follow the outline of his figure as it is to pick out a green caterpillar against a leaf. This affectation was carried out even to the green acacia stick which swung between his fingers. Only his hat and boots were black, the former similar to his companion's, but enriched by the addition of a tiny band of gold lacework round the edge. c"], [30, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 18 As the two drew near the entrance to the lodge, Franz took his pipe from his mouth, and held the gate open for them to pass. At the same time he removed his hat and greeted the younger one, who entered first, with a deep bow. \"Good day, Herr Maurice,\" he said, in respectful tones. \"Good day, Franz,\" responded the other carelessly. \" I have brought my friend, Herr Auguste, to taste your cider. And how is my little Dorothea ? \" He went up to her as he spoke, took her in his arms, and kissed her on the forehead. The young girl sub mitted to the embrace with an unconsciousness which was more innocent than any show of bashfulness. Then he turned to his companion. \" Here, Auguste, let me present you to the Fraulein.\" The elder man gravely lifted his hat and bowed. Dorothea returned a deep curtsey, and then made a movement towards the door of the cottage. \" I will go into the house and get another glass for Herr Auguste,\" she said to the one who was called Maurice. He nodded, and, beckoning his friend to follow, led the way to a corner of the garden, where a quaint, old fashioned arbour made a pleasant nook to shelter in from the glare of the sun outside. In the arbour stood a rustic table, formed out of a broad slice sawn off the trunk of an oak tree, and still retaining the bark round its uneven edge. It was supported by an upright loo cut, perhaps, from a branch of the same tree. The table was set out with a tall silver flagon of antique"], [31, "THE GARDEN OF EDEN. 19 workmanship, and a long narrow goblet of dark green glass of a manufacture peculiar to the district. The two men seated themselves on a bench of materials to match the table, and gazed thoughtfully at one another for a moment without speaking. Presently Maurice raised his hand and gave the other a playful tap on the shoulder. \" Come, Auguste, why so serious ? What do you think of my favourite, now you have seen her ? Re member, I want you to tell me frankly.\" Auguste played with the glass goblet, and looked away from his friend's eyes. \" I am wondering what would happen if I were to take you at your word,\" he answered, with a smile of some cynicism. \" What do you mean ? \" \" It is easy to ask for a frank opinion. It is not so easy to receive it, when it does not happen to be the one we want.\" \" Auguste ! Why do you talk like that ? Surely you cannot help liking her?\" The other man shook off his moody fit, and sat upright. \"She is perfectly charming, my dear friend. You have discovered a gem. I am only trying to think what you will do with it.\" The young man gave a dissatisfied frown. \" How long have you learned to be so discreet ? \" he said in a tone of reproach. \" What have we to do with the future ? Surely it is enough to enjoy this moment while it lasts ? Since I found out this delightful spot,"], [32, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 20 I have been happy. Your absence has been my only cause of regret ; and even that I have forgotten during the hours I have spent here in the company of this beautiful child.\" \"Ah,\" murmured the other, with a touch of sadness, \" the sunshine of love soon puts out the fire of friend ship.\" \"No, no,\" protested Maurice, eagerly. \" Do you trust me so little after all these years ? When have I ever doubted you ? \" He spoke earnestly. The elder man was moved. Laying his hand gently on his friend's arm, he said softly \u2014 \" I know. You must forgive my jealousy. The only wonder is that I have had you to myself for so long.\" \" And you have still. Believe me, you do not under stand my feelings towards this child. Love ? I hardly know whether it is love or not. And she ? She, I am certain, has never guessed what brings me here day after day. I almost wish she did. I am afraid some times lest, if I ever speak to her of love, I shall frighten her from me altogether, like some timid bird.\" He broke off, catching the sound of footsteps on the gravel path outside. The next moment Dorothea her self appeared under the archway which led into the arbour, framed like a picture in the green trellis-work. She bore in her hand a second goblet, like the first, but with a small piece chipped out of the rim. \"You must excuse the flaw, sir,\" she said, with a bright smile, as she set it down before Herr Auguste. \" It was done by my cousin Johann when he was a boy.\""], [33, "THE GARDEN OF EDEN. 21 Maurice now changed his seat to the other side of the table, and invited Dorothea to take the place by his side ; but she preferred to remain standing, and busied herself in pouring out cider for her guests. Auguste kept his eyes fixed on the pair, and shrewdly noted everything as he sipped from time to time at the pale straw-coloured beverage in the cool green chalice. The other two kept up a half-confidential chat, during which old Franz drew slowly near, and took up a post of observation on the path outside. Suddenly, during a pause in the conversation, Maurice bethought himself, and slipped one hand into the pocket of his jacket. \"See,\" he said, drawing into view a small parcel wrapped in tissue paper, \" I have brought you a keep sake.\" Dorothea's eyes sparkled. Half eagerly, half timidly, she held out her hand. Laughingly the young man placed the packet in her outstretched palm. She tore off the wrappings, and the next instant was gazing in breathless delight at a tiny brooch, which had a bright yellow carbuncle in the centre, set round with a ring of white petals, each of them represented by a pearl. \" It is a daisy ! Oh, how beautiful ! \" she exclaimed. \" Look, father ; see what Herr Maurice has given me ! \" And before Maurice could check the movement, she had darted out of the arbour to show her treasure to the forester. Franz weighed it in his hand, and inspected it with the careful eye of a dealer."], [34, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 22 \"The Herr is very generous,\" he remarked approv ingly. \" It must be worth at least a hundred florins.\" Auguste, who overheard him, could not forbear a smile. He knew that the little brooch had been specially manufactured by the most famous jeweller in Paris, and that it had taken weeks to bring together the perfectly shaped gems which formed the petals of the flower. But Dorothea had been appalled by the magnitude of the sum named by her father. She came back slowly, and gazed at Maurice with a look of shy alarm. \"It is too good for me,\" she said doubtfully. \"You might have given it to one of the ladies up at the Castle.\" Maurice laughed. \"Yes, I think I might have prevailed on one of them to accept it \u2014 what do you say, Auguste ? \" \" I do not know one lady of the Court on whom it would look better than on the Fraulein,\" was the response. \" Come, let me see it on your neck,\" said Maurice. \" I think I am entitled to fasten it in its place.\" He went towards her for the purpose ; and Auguste, glancing round to see if the forester were still about, strolled out of the arbour and joined him. Left alone with Dorothea, Maurice took a more caressing tone ; and the young girl, on her side, seemed to lose a little of her restraint. They sat side by side, and talked to each other in low tones which could not be heard outside. After a little while, however, Dorothea noticed that"], [35, "THE GARDEN OF EDEN. 23 her companion was in a more serious mood than was his wont. Some change seemed to have come over him, and now and again she caught him gazing at her with a meditative air, as if he wished to say something, but were doubtful how to begin. At length, after a longer pause than usual, he said slowly \u2014 \" Have you ever been away from here, Dorothea ? Have you seen anything ofthe outside world ?\" \" Oh yes,\" she answered readily. \" I often go into the village, and once or twice father has taken me to Dresselburg.\" This was the name of a small market town some seven miles away. \" Besides,\" she added, \" I sometimes go to the Castle when the Court is not there, and see all over it.\" \"Ah!\" The young man's face brightened, as if he had found the opening he sought. \" Do you like the Castle ? Do you think you should care to come and live there yourself, and see the Court as well?\" Dorothea's blue eyes grew round with awe. \" Oh ! \" she cried breathlessly, too overcome by the suggestion to take it in all at once. But the next moment she gave her head a shake which stirred all the little golden curls that fringed her face. \" I do not think I should like it,\" she said. \" I should be afraid of all those people. And King Maximilian \u2014 if he were to speak to me I think I should sink into the earth.\" A frown crossed the young man's face. \" Is Maximilian so very terrible, then ? \" he asked. \" Has any one taught you to dread him ? \""], [36, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 24 \"No, no. It is not that. But it is because he is the King. I should feel afraid of him\u2014 I do not know why. And yet I have often wished that I could see him, if I could be hidden behind something, so that he would not know I was there.\" \" You do not feel unkindly towards him, then ? \" \"Unkindly? Oh no! How could I, when he is our King? I bless him every night when I say my prayers, and ask God not to let him go mad, like his father.\" The young man trembled. He allowed one or two minutes to go by in silence, and when he spoke again his voice was low and indistinct. \"Do you think,\" he said slowly \u2014 \"do people say, that there is any likelihood of that ? \" \" I never heard that,\" was the answer. \" But of course It is in the blood, and they say that when that is so, it may break out at any moment. Do you think it is true that Doctor Krauss, the great mind doctor, is always on the watch, and follows the King secretly wherever he goes ? \" She stopped, surprised at the agitation of her com panion, who had buried his face in his hands, and was stifling a groan. \"What is it, Herr Maurice?\" she asked anxiously. \" Are you ill ? Shall I call father ? \" \" No. Say nothing. Take no notice.\" And he got up abruptly, and made his way out of the arbour. In the mean time Herr Auguste had gone for a stroll round the garden with old Franz."], [37, "THE GARDEN OF EDEN. 25 On the way he engaged in conversation about Dorothea. \" How old is your daughter ? \" he began. \"Just seventeen, Excellency.\" \" Do not call me that,\" said the other quickly. \" I have no title, except plain Herr.\" \"As the Herr pleases,\" returned the forester bowing, with evident incredulity. \" Dorothea is a good girl,\" he added. \" She does what her father tells her, in every thing.\" \" Humph ! And pray what is to be the end of this ? \" He jerked his hand back in the direction of the arbour. The old man drew in his horns. \" I do not understand. Herr Maurice is very kind and generous. He comes here often, and has made us many presents.\" \" Nonsense, man ! That is not the way to talk to me. Do you think I am blind ? But perhaps I ought to tell you my name, and then you may know who I am. Have you heard of Auguste Bernal ? \" Franz bowed with deep respect. The name was well known to every one connected with the Court. \"His Majesty's friend?\" he said. \"Yes. Understand that my only interest in this matter is a friendly one. I wish no ill to you or your charming little daughter. But what advice am I to give to my friend Maurice ? You are not a fool, and you must know what an affair like this is likely to lead to.\" The forester drew himself up and gave his questioner a cunning leer. \" I have seen to that,\" he said. \" I have spoken to"], [38, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 26 Herr Maurice already. He has promised to make me Ranger of the forest, and to settle a pension on Dorothea for life. He spoke with an air of pride, like one who feels that he has done everything that can reasonably be expected of him, and come well out of a trying situation. Bernal turned on him a look of the most profound disgust, which the forester was too absorbed in his inward self-gratulation to perceive. They walked on in silence for a short time. \"Your daughter does not understand the meaning of these attentions yet,\" remarked Bernal, presently. The father shrugged his shoulders. \" She has been well brought up,\" was the response. \"By you?\" asked the other, dryly. Franz nodded, with perfect unconsciousness. \"And by her mother,\" he added. \"She died three years ago next midsummer.\" \"Poor child!\" murmured Bernal. By this time they had completed a circuit, and were again drawing near to the arbour, from which they were in time to see the young man rush out, looking deeply disturbed. Auguste quickened his steps to come up to his friend, whom he took affectionately by the arm. \"Has anything happened?\" he inquired in low tones. \"No, nothing. Do not ask me about it. It was only an accidental remark which jarred on me. But it is time for us to be going.\""], [39, "THE GARDEN OF EDEN. 27 Dorothea came out to them, with wonder and concern written on her face. \" Good-bye, little one,\" said Maurice, tenderly ; and once more he embraced her. She looked up at him humbly, \" I have not offended you, sir ? You will come again ? \" she pleaded. \"My dear little creature, you offend me! Of course I shall come again. You do look forward to my visits, then ? \" he said, with a brighter face. \"Very much, sir; and so does father.\" \"Ah! Well, good-bye.\" Pie took a step from her. \"Thank the Herr Maurice for his handsome present before he goes,\" came in the tones of a drill-sergeant from the forester. Before Dorothea could obey, Maurice had seized his friend's arm, and was walking rapidly towards the gate, with Franz hurrying after them to open it. Dorothea followed more slowly, and stood there beside her father to watch the two visitors disappearing among the trees. While they were still absorbed in gazing at the opening down which the others had vanished, Dorothea gradually became aware of some subtle change in the landscape. At first she thought it must be a dullness in the air ; then she fancied a cloud must have passed across the drooping sun. But no, the bright sunshine still lay on the forest, and bathed the sward before the garden gate. What was it, then ? As she withdrew her eyes from the spot on which they had been fixed,"], [40, "28 A CROWN OF STRAW. she perceived with a start what had been knocking, as it were, at the door of her consciousness. A long dark shadow, the shadow of a man coming with noiseless steps, had stolen across the grass in front of where she stood, and lay like a black pointing finger on the ground."], [41, "2C, CHAPTER II. THE SPY. DOROTHEA and her father both looked round and caught sight of the new-comer at the same moment. They saw a tall, handsome fellow of about thirty, dressed like an artisan of good standing. The dust on his boots showed that he had walked a long way. His dark, firmly stamped features bore the marks of thought and endurance, and his whole bearing was bold, resolute \u2014 almost defiant. Old Franz drew back with a scowl as this stranger presented himself before the gate. But Dorothea, after one look at his face, gave a glad cry, and, darting through the gateway, clasped her arms round his neck and kissed him on both cheeks. The young man received her embrace with an indulgent smile, while he turned a stern glance on the forester. \"Father,\" exclaimed Dorothea, releasing her hold, \" don't you sec ? It is Johann ! \" \" Yes, I see it's Johann,\" muttered the old man, in a tone half surly and half timorous, as he slowly extended"], [42, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 30 his hand. \"And what wind blows you here?\" he demanded. \" I had business in the neighbourhood, and I thought Dorothea would be glad to see me,\" was the curt response. \" But you must say nothing about my visit,\" he added, turning to the girl. \"No one must know that I have been here.\" Dorothea looked bewildered. Her father gave a dissatisfied grunt. \" More mysteries,\" he remarked. \" You will get into trouble again one of these days, mark my words. I shouldn't wonder if you were in some conspiracy at this very moment.\" \" Well, uncle, I have not asked you to join in it, any way,\" retorted Johann. \" Who are those two men who have just gone into the forest ? \" Before answering Franz snatched time to throw a warning look at his daughter, as a hint to keep silence. \"Only two gentlemen from the Castle, who came here to drink a cup of our cider. I don't want to be brought into disgrace by you and your doings. It is bad enough to hear about your goings-on in Mannhausen. I can't think why they don't clap the whole lot of you into prison.\" \"For what? For demanding that the people may have freedom to better their lot ? \" \"Oh, don't talk to me about the people! Old King Leopold knew how to deal with fellows like you. You were afraid of him, but now you have the insolence to attack King Maximilian, who is too good for you. Don't let me catch you in any of your seditious practices"], [43, "THE SPY. 31 here, that's all, or the King shall hear of it, as sure as my name's Franz Gitten.\" The forester spoke bitterly. There is no hatred like the hatred of the favoured servant for those who would enfranchise him against his will. Johann was about to make some angry reply, when Dorothea laid a gentle hand upon his arm, and looked up beseechingly in his face. \"Don't, Johann! Don't talk about it any more. Come in and rest after your journey, and have some thing to eat. We have got a hare pie and a custard.\" The young man's features relaxed their sternness. He turned and followed her into the house, while Franz resumed his post of sentinel at the gate. But this time the puffs of smoke from the china bowl came in fierce, uneven jerks, and an uneasy frown crossed and recrossed his face. His daughter led Johann into the kitchen, where he seated himself on the old-fashioned settle, while she busied herself in getting ready a meal. \" So gentlemen come here from the Castle, do they ? \" murmured the young man half to himself. \" I wonder what is the attraction that brings them here ? \" He glanced at his cousin as she moved lightly to and fro in the sunshine. The yellow beams splashed on her rippling hair like rain falling upon running water. \" How old are you by this time, Dorothea ? \" \"Seventeen next birthday, Johann. I am making myself a dress with long skirts to go to church in.\" \" And where did you get that pretty brooch ? \""], [44, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 32 \" Herr Maurice gave it me \u2014 one of those gentlemen you saw going away.\" \" Ha ! \" Johann sat up, alert. \" Then this is not the first time they have come here ? \" \"It is the first time his friend has been here, but Herr Maurice comes nearly every day.\" \"Does he? And pray who is this Herr Maurice? What is his surname, and what is he at the Court ? \" \"We do not know \u2014 at least, I don't, though I some times think my father has some idea. But when I ask him he always says that if Herr Maurice wished us to know who he was he would tell us of his own accord.\" \" I see. My uncle is prudent. What kind of man is he ? Young ? Handsome ? \" \"Oh no \u2014 not young. At least, I should think he was quite thirty.\" Johann smiled. \" And not so very handsome. There is something in his eyes that almost frightens me sometimes. I fancy he is shy. He often sits thinking by himself, and never says a word.\" Johann looked less and less pleased as he listened, and almost forgot to cat his food. \" Well, do not have too much to say to him, Dorothea. I don't like gentlemen who do not give their names, and make presents of brooches, and sit thinking by them selves. Do you like him ? Should you miss him if he left off coming here ? \" Dorothea began to grow uneasy under this fire of questions. \" Miss him ? Yes, of course ; this place is so lonely that I should miss any one. Do you like the hare ? \" \" Ay. Is it one of the King's ? \""], [45, "THE SPY. 33 \" You must ask father that. He shot it. But where have you been all this while ? and why have you never come here? \" \" 1 have been in the capital working at my trade, of course. They don't print newspapers in the forest ; so, you see, I should starve if I spent much time here.\" Dorothea stole up to him, and whispered a timid question. \" I hope it isn't true what father said about con spiracies ? You don't really hate the good young King, do you, Johann? \" \" I don't hate any one who is good. But never mind the King. I haven't come here to talk about him. Give me some cider, if you can spare any from your friend who gives the brooches.\" The young girl gave a swift look at him, then, turning away, with a gesture equally swift she snapped the brooch from her neck, and slipped it into her pocket. Then she went to fetch the cider. As soon as Johann had refreshed himself sufficiently, he got up, and announced that he must take his departure. Dorothea followed him out to the gate, where her father was still lounging, with a sullen but determined look on his face. \" Where are you going ? \" was the only remark he vouchsafed by way of farewell to his nephew. Johann pointed to the path through the woodland, by which the two friends had disappeared. His uncle instantly gripped him by the arm. \" No,\" he cried hoarsely ; \" not that way ! Not to the Castle ! \" D"], [46, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 34 \" Why not ? \" demanded Johann, fiercely. \" Are you afraid of my discovering who is the gentleman who has fallen in love with your \u2014 cider ? \" He pronounced the last word with a sarcastic emphasis which made the old man recoil, and turn a startled glance at Dorothea. The girl was gazing from one to the other with quickly dawning consciousness. \" I had one errand to the Castle already ; now I have two,\" pursued the young man, pitilessly. \" Be assured I will find out this Herr Maurice, and demand an explanation from him.\" \" No, no ! \" exclaimed the alarmed forester, carried away by his fears. \"You must not meddle with Herr Maurice. I know who he is.\" Johann's eyes flashed. \" What ? Out with it, man, or it will be the worse for him and you ! \" The old man bent forward and whispered two words in his nephew's ear. His caution was thrown away. \" The King ! I might have known it was that cursed race.\" And without even looking at Dorothea, Johann threw wide the gate, and strode on into the depth of the sorest. His first rush of anger worn off, Johann went forward steadily, shaping his course straight towards the royal palace, and walking with the step of one who has an errand of weight. The forester and his daughter stood helplessly gazing in the direction in which he had vanished from their sight. Dorothea's mind was overwhelmed beneath a"], [47, "THE SPY. 35 sensation of amazement. The revelation made by Johann's parting words was enough to keep her thoughts busy, without giving them time to dwell upon the significance of his sudden departure. But old Franz was seriously alarmed as he stood there turning over the threatening language which he had just heard his nephew use. For these were restless times, and even the old forester in his snug retreat had heard something of the discontents which were agitating the distant capital, and in stirring up which he suspected that his nephew had borne an active part. He had heard of Johann's connection with revolutionary societies during the reign of the old King, Leopold IX., and now that these fanatics were raising their heads again in enmity to the mild government of Maximilian, he felt pretty sure that Johann was having a finger in the pie. \"What do they want? \" he grumbled, rather to him self than to his daughter. \" They have changed King Stork for King Log, and still they are not satisfied. And now this reckless fellow is going to do something that will bring disgrace upon his family, and perhaps lose me my post ! \" Too much agitated to say anything, Dorothea turned from him and went indoors, to try and adjust her mind to the startling knowledge which had so suddenly come upon it. In the mean time, if it were Johann's object to over take Maximilian and his companion on their way to the Castle, he was destined to fail. The two friends had, quite unconsciously, baffled any pursuit by striking into"], [48, "36 A CROWN OF STRAW. a by-path, along which they made their way back un disturbed. Coming along they discussed the situation at the forester's lodge. The King was anxious to know what impression Dorothea had produced on his friend. \"You promised to speak plainly, Auguste,\" he re minded him. \"Tell me exactly what you think of her.\" \" You need hardly ask,\" was the answer. \" I have never seen a more charming little creature. It is not merely her face which is so captivating, but her exquisite gentleness and innocence. Why, she does not even suspect that you love her. And her manners are as graceful as if she had spent all her days in a palace.\" \"So she has,\" responded Maximilian, warmly. \" She has lived in the palace of Nature, in this noble forest, far removed from the vulgar surroundings that transform the poor of cities into little better than brutes.\" \" I am afraid I cannot agree with you there,\" said Bernal. \" So far as I can see, her surroundings have very little to do with it I have known many cases of refinement among the denizens of slums, and I have never come across a more depraved brute than that old man we have just left.\" \" What makes you say that ? \" asked the king, un easily. \" His own confession. The fellow boasted openly to me of the price for which he had agreed to sell his daughter. You ought to be ashamed of stooping to such a bargain.\" Maximilian blushed, and bit his lip. \" I am ashamed of it,\" he said. \" I loathe that man"], [49, "THE SPY. 37 as much as you do. He is so odious to me that the thought of having to encounter him almost deters me from going there, sometimes. But what else could I do ? I could not expect him to understand the nature of my feelings towards his daughter. As soon as he showed me what kind of man he was, I thought the best plan was to take him at his own value, and bribe him to stand aside and hold his tongue.\" \"Nevertheless it was a miserable thing to do. How should you feel if the girl were to learn the understand ing you had come to with her father ? \" \"Ah, that is what I dread most. At all costs I must keep her innocent. You little know \u2014 and yet perhaps you do know \u2014 how deeply I feel about that girl. Surely you have been in love at some time, Auguste. You must see how difficult it is for me. I am not like the man whose love is hopeless because it is fixed on one too far above him. What I have to fear is that my love will prevail too easily, not for my own sake, but because I have the misfortune to be a king. That is why I have been coming here secretly. I want to win Dorothea's heart, Auguste. I do not want her to become my slave. I want her to love me.\" \" I am afraid she does not love you yet, my friend. Perhaps she is too young. Perhaps even in your assumed character she looks upon you as one too far above her to be thought of as a lover.\" \" I am afraid of that, too. I ought to have gone there as a peasant, or as one of the foresters. But my first visit was quite accidental, and I have gone on ever since on the same footing.\""], [50, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 38 Auguste considered a moment as he walked along. Then he made a suggestion. \" Why not take her away from her father, and place her in some better position ? \" \"I have thought of that,\" answered Maximilian. \" But I hardly dare do that yet. You see, she is little more than a child, and as shy and timid as a fawn. I fear to break the spell by taking any step that might open her eyes. It is not only because I do not want to influence her consent that I have kept my rank concealed. I am almost equally afraid of frightening her, and causing her to become uneasy and constrained with me. I have watched her carefully ; and from something which she let drop only to-day, I foresee what might happen if she got an inkling of whom I really was.\" \" But this state of things cannot last for ever. Sooner or later she must find it all out.\" \" I know ; and that is what torments me. The very shyness and simplicity which make me love her must perish as soon as I once declare my love. That is my curse. What can I do? I can only go on and enjoy this Arcadian life as long as fate allows it to last. When it is over \" He did not finish the sentence, and for a little while the pair strode on side by side in silence, the elder man picking his way carefully over the dead branches and little spots of moisture which broke the path, while the younger one crunched blindly over everything in his way, his eyes half-closed in dreamy abstraction. \" Yes ? When it is over ? \""], [51, "THE SPY. 39 It was Auguste who spoke, with a meditative glance at his friend's countenance. \" I cannot make up my mind. I do not know yet what I shall do.\" \"You forget that you are in love,\" observed the other cynically. \" Perhaps there is not so much room for doubt as to what you will do as you suppose.\" The King smiled at him with a slight tinge of scorn. \"Perhaps you do not understand me, Auguste. The doubt in my mind is whether I shall make Dorothea \" He hesitated. His friend stopped dead, and gazed at him in unconcealed dismay. \"What?\" Maximilian stopped too, and looked steadily back at him. \" My wife.\" This time Auguste was fairly astounded. For some moments he could do nothing but stand and stare at the speaker. At length his lips parted, and the exclamation escaped him \u2014 \" Good heavens ! Are you mad ? \" It was the second time that afternoon that the word had been pronounced in the young man's hearing. He turned pale, and, casting himself on the ground at the foot of a tree, burst into tears. Overwhelmed with sorrow and remorse, his friend knelt down beside him, and tenderly sought to soothe him into a calmer frame of mind. For some time he could effect nothing, but at last the King conquered his weakness. He arose, and, thrusting his arm through his companion's"], [52, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 40 in token of forgiveness, they proceeded in silence to the palace. In the glorious woodland lurk deadly enemies to man \u2014 the fierce wild boar and the treacherous gliding adder. Maximilian went through the forest with his friend, in ignorance that its green shades concealed the presence of two men who represented two threatening dangers in his path. He recked not of the stern, resolved messenger who was tramping steadily behind, with a grim purpose written on his face. As little did he dream that he was being preceded on his way back by another messenger, whose watchful eye had seen him enter and leave the forester's lodge, who had started up from his hiding-place in the brush-wood when the two friends emerged from the lodge gate, and, plunging into the thickness of the trees, hurried on before them to the Castle. The spy was a young man of nearly the same age as Maximilian himself; he was dressed in a livery or uniform of green cloth, bound at the edges with red braid, of the colour of holly-berries, and ornamented with buttons of the same warm tint. He was not ill savoured \u2014 at first sight his face looked handsome \u2014 but there was a weakness in the lines of the chin, the hair and eyebrows were too light, and the eyes were of that sort that blink and turn away when closely gazed into. Dodging skilfully in and out among the trees like a practised wou'i nan, and breaking into a run whenever the nature of the ground allowed of it, he was not lon\u00b0 in covering the distance to the further edge of the woodland. He took a round-about course, and emerged"], [53, "THE SPY. 41 at a point which would not suggest to any chance onlooker the direction from which he had really come. Once out in the open grounds before the Castle, he walked swiftly up to a side entrance and made his way quietly into the building. Safe within the huge but ugly palace, he lost no time in threading his way through the corridors, with the assured air of one who felt himself at home, till he came to a suite of apartments situated on the first floor of the left wing. There he stopped, and rapped con fidently at a door. His knock was answered by a page wearing the royal livery, who appeared instantly to recognize him. \" Tell the Princess Hermengarde that Karl Fink is in attendance.\" The page nodded at these words, and withdrew from the door. The next minute he returned. \" Her Royal Highness will see you now,\" he said. And, beckoning Karl to follow, he led the way into the presence ofthe King's aunt."], [54, "42 CHAPTER III. THE PRINCESS HERMENGARDE'S DISCLOSURE. The Princess Hermengarde was one of those characters of whom much is said but little is known. It was said that she was proud. It was hinted that she was ambitious. It was admitted that she had once been beautiful. In the days before her marriage, when she was still the heiress to the Duchy of Schwerin- Strelitz, she had been flattered with the title of the belle of Europe. In her thirty-sixth year she was still handsome and commanding, but the youthful loveliness had disappeared. What years had failed to do had been wrought more surely by disappointed hope and wounded pride. In the words of Count von Stahlen, the Court wit, the Princess Hermengarde was an old woman of middle age. Her mortifications had begun, when she was still under twenty, with the birth of a male heir to her father's Grand Duchy. Before that event she had been looked upon as one of the most brilliant matches in Europe, and Austrian archdukes and British princes of the blood were said to have made overtures for her"], [55, "THE PRINCESS. 43 hand. When the blow fell which reduced her at one stroke to a position of insignificance, two royal wooers, who had been contending for her smiles immediately before, withdrew from their courtship with a precipita tion which, in a lower class of life, might have exposed them to the suspicion of being fortune hunters. One of them went off in hot haste to St. Petersburg, where he was just in time to secure a Grand Duchess of the house of Romanoff. The other, not quite so fortunate, fell back upon a Scandinavian princess. It was while still smarting from these insulting desertions, that Hermengarde had consented to accept the hand of Otto, the younger brother of Leopold IX. At this time Maximilian was a delicate boy of twelve, and there being no other life between Prince Otto and the throne, his wife might still cherish the possibility of one day reigning over a kingdom. But the unfortunate young Princess was destined to undergo yet further trials. Within a few months of their marriage, Otto began to show traces of that savage cruelty which seemed to be part of the hereditary taint in the Franconian line. For a long time his proud young wife submitted in silence, and allowed no hint of her sufferings to reach the outside world. But when her son was born, and her husband's senseless brutality went so far as to threaten the infant, her maternal instinct and her ambition together took arms, and she faced her tyrant with unexpected courage. The miserable state of affairs culminated, it was said, in the haughty Princess fleeing at midnight from her apartments, clad in little beside a cloak, and bearing"], [56, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 44 her child in her arms, to take refuge in the quarters of the Baron von Sigismark and his wife, from the murderous violence of her husband. Immediately afterwards Prince Otto went mad, or rather his madness was officially announced. Hermen garde went into retirement, devoting herself to the training of her son ; but after the deaths of her husband and of King Leopold, she had returned to the Court, where she lived on good terms with her nephew, and exercised a certain authority in the absence of a queen-consort. Her apartments in the left wing of the Castle of Neustadt corresponded in situation with those occupied by the King himself in the right wing, and looked out over the decorated gardens to the belt of forest beyond. On this particular afternoon the Princess had been sitting in the window of her boudoir, gazing abstractedly out upon the park, while a look of deep thought rested on her proud features. By-and-by she had tired of waiting alone, and struck a small silver gong by her side. The summons was obeyed by the page in attendance. \"Karl Fink has not been here?\" inquired the Princess. \" No, Madam, not yet.\" \" Go and see who is in the ante-room, and bring me word.\" The page darted off, and immediately returned. \" The Count von Sigismark has just come, your Royal Highness. He is talking with the Lady Gertrude.\" \" Ah ! Is there no one else outside ? \""], [57, "THE PRINCESS. 45 \"No, Madam. Count von Stahlen and Baron von Hardenburg have just gone away.\" \"Good,\" Hermengarde dismissed the lad with a nod, and then stood considering for a few seconds. Presently she lifted her head, and moved quietly towards the outer room. The Count von Sigismark was the same personage whose protection she had sought fifteen years before. He was of a type which is fast disappearing in con- stitutionally-governed countries \u2014 a courtier statesman. Under King Leopold he had held the post of Comp- troller of the Household, and in that capacity had neglected no opportunity of quietly serving the heir to the throne. Maximilian stood in need of kindness, and was not ungrateful for it. His first act of authority on ascending the throne had been to raise Von Sigismark from the rank of baron to that of count, and by a rapid course of promotion, the fortunate Comptroller soon found himself exalted to the highest position in the State as Chancellor of Franconia, and head of the Government. His powers had long been practically unchecked by interference from his royal master, and Von Stahlen had gone so far as to give him the nick- name ofthe Regent\" \u2014 a dangerous compliment, with which the cautious old Count was by no means pleased. The favour which he enjoyed under Maximilian did not lead the wary courtier to neglect those in whose hands the power of the future might lie. While the present King remained without a direct heir, Hermen garde's young son stood next in the succession to the throne. The Chancellor had carefully kept up his"], [58, "46 A CROWN OF STRAW. friendship with the Princess, and had induced her to receive his daughter Gertrude into her household. The Count was now a widower, and Gertrude was his only child. The two young gentlemen with whom he had found his daughter engaged on this occasion were well-known characters in the Court. One has already been men tioned as its recognized wit ; the other was his insepar able companion and admirer, whose business in life was to publish to the world the masterpieces of epigram which fell from his friend's lips. These epigrams were thought by some to have more personality than point. It was Von Stahlen who had invented for Maximilian the sobriquet of \" King of the Fairies.\" This was com plimentary, but most of his shafts were barbed with satire. Thus he had described Franconia in her relations with Prussia as \" the kettle tied to the dog's tail,\" and had characterized the diplomacy of the Chancellor as \" irritating efforts to soothe Bismarck.\" Most people failed to see anything clever in these sayings, but everybody felt that it would be unpleasant to have the indefatigable Von Hardenburg spreading similar remarks about themselves. The Count von Stahlen was there fore universally dreaded and disliked, and was the most sought-after man in the whole Court. Even Gertrude had not escaped his railing tongue. Having neglected him recently under the influence of some flattering attentions from King Maximilian him self, he had taken his revenge by referring to her as \" the royal milkmaid \" \u2014 a galling allusion to the fact that the fortunes of the Sigismarks had been founded"], [59, "THE PRINCESS. 47 less than three hundred years before by a dairyman in Mannhausen. It was only natural that the beauty should now show herself extraordinarily gracious to her returning admirer. Seated on a low chair beside the couch on which she was leaning, the Count was just finishing an anecdote deeply to the discredit of a noblewoman who happened to be Gertrude's bosom friend, when they were inter rupted by the entrance of Von Sigismark. \" For shame ! \" laughed Gertrude, rising to greet her father. \" How dare you tell me such things ! You know the Viscountess is my friend.\" \" The very reason why I repeated it to you,\" retorted the wit. \" I know that with you it will go no further. Good morning, Chancellor.\" The Minister included both young men in a sombre recognition. Then he turned to his daughter. \" Is the Princess well to-day ? \" \" Yes. Shall I let her know you are here ? \" \" Presently. I want a word with you first.\" Von Stahlen and his companion took the hint. \" Will you excuse us, Lady Gertrude ? \" said the Count, with laboured courtesy. \"Von Hardenburg and I have an important appointment \u2014 political business. I hope, Chancellor, you will not think that you have driven us away.\" And, preserving a smile of bland innocence, he retired, his henchman walking after him with ill-suppressed delight. The old Chancellor followed them to the door with a scowl."], [60, "48 A CROWN OF STRAW. \"These young fools are growing unbearable,\" he remarked severely. \"You should not encourage them so much. They can do you no good. Von Stahlen has nearly run through his inheritance, and the other never had any inheritance to run through.\" \" They are nothing to me,\" was the reply. \" I find the Count amusing sometimes, that is all.\" \"Well, do not be seen with them too much. The King might hear of it.\" \" The King?\" Gertrude turned a startled look on her father. \" I said the King. I think you know what I mean.\" \" Father ! Do you really think he cares \u2014 that he notices \u2014 what I do ? \" The Chancellor nodded. \" I am sure of it. I have watched him for some time, and, unless I am deceived, he thinks more of you than he has yet thought of any other woman.\" A bright blush came on the girl's face. \"Do you really think so ? I have sometimes thought \u2014 and yet, lately, I have doubted again. But, after all, even if the King did care for me, what could come of it?\" Her father indulged in a deep smile. \" What should you say if a crown came of it ? \" He rather whispered than spoke the words. \"Oh no! You cannot be in earnest? Surely the King would not marry any one not of royal blood ? \" \" Perhaps so. And yet perhaps not so.\" The old Count cast a cautious look around him before going on. \" You know the cloud that rests upon the race of Astolf:"], [61, "THE PRINCESS. 49 their alliance is not very eagerly sought. The other reigning houses remember the fate of Maximilian's father, and of his grandfather, and of his uncle Otto.\" \" Father ! \" \u2014 there was a note of real fear in the girl's voice \u2014 \"you do not mean that you think the King is affected by such a taint ? \" \" Heaven forbid ! I have never thought anything of the kind. Maximilian is not like his House. But nevertheless the possibility is there, and he may find it easier to choose a queen among his own subjects than abroad.\" Before the subdued girl could make any further answer, a door opened at the end of the apartment. \"Hush !\" whispered the Chancellor, hastily. \" Not a hint of this before the Princess. Remember that the King's marriage means to her an obstacle between her son and the throne.\" And assuming an air in which cheerful friendliness was only tempered by the proper admixture of defer ence, he turned to greet Hermengarde. On her part, the Princess approached him rather with the air of an old friend than a superior in rank. \" I am so glad to find you here, my dear Chancellor,\" she said graciously. \" It must be so pleasant for you to snatch a few minutes from the dry affairs of State for the society of our dear Gertrude. I only hope that you will not mind my joining in your talk ? \" \"You do us too much honour, Madam,\" was the courtier's answer. \"But I feel sure that you will ap prove of the advice I have been giving my daughter\u2014 li"], [62, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 50 not to listen too much to the empty talk of the young fops who haunt the Court.\" \" You are quite right, Count,\" said Hermengarde, with an approving nod. \" You have a right to look higher for your daughter. Your rank and services to the State entitle you to expect no ordinary son-in-law. And you, too, Gertrude,\" she continued, fixing her keen gaze on the girl's tell-tale face, \" perhaps you have already fixed your thoughts on some suitor of preten sions lofty enough to satisfy even your father's just ambition for you.\" \" Madam,\" Gertrude stammered out, \" I have no thoughts in the matter, except to obey my father.\" \"An admirable answer!\" exclaimed the Princess, lightly. \" Count, I congratulate you on your child. I only hope mine will prove as obedient. But I am for getting what I was about to say to you. Have you been much in the company ofthe King lately?\" The Chancellor lifted his head and darted a swift glance at her, and then drew back a couple of inches, with the instinctive movement of one who feels himself on dangerous ground. \"Not more than usual, Madam. There has been nothing to take me specially into his Majesty's com pany.\" \"Quite so. And you have not noticed anything unusual in his demeanour \u2014 anything that has led you to suspect that something important was going on ? \" This time the Minister failed to conceal his nervous apprehension. \" I confess I fail to understand you, Madam. So far"], [63, "THE PRINCESS. 51 as I know, the King has been engaged in his ordinary pursuits. Of course, he is a good deal taken up with the preparations for opening this new palace of his at Seidlingen.\" The Princess watched Von Sigismark keenly as he spoke, and a slight look of scorn passed across her countenance, to be instantly replaced by an indulgent smile. \" I see that I am about to astonish you. What should you say if I were to tell you that I have discovered that my nephew is in love ? \" In spite of his habitual caution, the old Count could not resist the impulse to turn and look at his daughter, who, on her part, utterly failed to conceal her embarrass^ ment from the keen eyes of the Princess. Before either of them could speak, Hermengarde followed up her thrust. \"Come, I see that I have surprised you both. Yet I should have thought that you, at least, Gertrude, would have noticed something.\" \" I, Madam ? \" The unfortunate girl could say no more, so completely did she feel herself at the mercy of her royal tormentor. \"Yes, come ; you are not going to pretend that you know nothing about my nephew's feelings. Why, it is not two months since the whole Court believed that he had lost his heart to you.\" The Chancellor felt it was time for him to come to his daughter's rescue. \" Surely your Royal Highness is jesting ? My daughter would never dare to entertain such an idea."], [64, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 52 Every one knows that a King of Franconia must marry in his own rank.\" Hermengarde shrugged her shoulders, \"Kings of Franconia do strange things sometimes,\" she retorted with significance. \" But I see that you are both in the dark. Yet this affair has been going on now for several weeks, though it has only come to my knowledge within the last few days.\" Gertrude made an effort to rally her courage and take part in the conversation. \" Perhaps it is the Baroness von Steinketel that you refer to, Madam ? \" she timidly suggested. Hermengarde smiled. The Baroness, a fat, over dressed woman of about forty, whose chief attraction consisted in a never-failing flow of animal spirits, had made herself the laughing-stock of the Court by her undisguised attempts to attract the notice of Maximilian. It was easy to see what a consolation it would have been to Gertrude to have no worse rival than this. \" I had better enlighten you at once,\" said the Princess. \" My eccentric nephew has not looked so high as the Baroness von Steinketel. He has bestowed his affections on a young peasant girl, the daughter of one of the royal foresters.\" The countenance of her two listeners underwent a change. On the Chancellor's face the expression of anxiety was succeeded by one of relief. \" I understand you, Madam. Thank Heaven it is no worse ! I confess that you seriously alarmed me. But, of course, a mere intrigue of that kind need not be taken very seriously. Gertrude, perhaps it would be"], [65, "THE PRINCESS. 53 better if you were to ask the Princess's leave to retire.\" \"Stay, do not be too confident,\" interposed the Princess, warningly ; \" I am afraid this affair may turn out to be more serious than you think. You have heard the tale of King Cophetua. For my part I should not be surprised at anything on the part of Maximilian.\" The Minister started, and gazed at Hermengarde in alarm, as if to ascertain whether any graver meaning lurked beneath her words. She returned a look as serious as his own, and in a few words sketched the situation at the forester's lodge. If she had hoped to surprise the Chancellor into any hasty expression of opinion, however, she was disap pointed. The old courtier listened to her in silence, striving to regain his composure in order to think the matter over at his leisure. At the close of Hermengarde's narrative, he remarked in his most diplomatic tone \u2014 \" I am greatly obliged by your confidence, Madam. I recognize the importance of what you have told me, which will of course remain a strict secret for the present. It is too soon to come to any decision on it as yet. Our best course, no doubt, will be to watch quietly, and wait.\" The Princess smiled rather bitterly. \" I dare say you are right, my dear Chancellor. However, I am glad to think that the responsibility no longer rests on my shoulders. Think the matter over, and come to me again.\" Von Sigismark took the implied dismissal, and bowed himself out with every demonstration of respect."], [66, "54 A CROWN OF STRAW. \" So much for the father,\" murmured the Princess to herself. \" Now for the daughter.\" She was about to address Gertrude aloud, when the page rapped at the door and announced that Karl Fink was in attendance. Hermengarde's eyes lit up with satisfaction. \" Let him come in at once,\" she commanded. \" Gertrude, I should like you to hear what this young man has to say.\" And the next minute the young forester in the green livery stood before them."], [67, "55 CHAPTER IV. A DOUBLE TRAITOR. Karl Fink was a familiar figure at the Castle. He was a favourite with the young King, who had chosen him from among the other foresters to be his regular attendant, and had lodged him in the royal quarter of the Castle. This Gertrude knew, but neither she nor Hermengarde was aware of a certain episode in the young forester's early life which might not be without its effect on the future. Karl entered the room with the confident air of one assured of his reception. But on seeing Gertrude he stopped short and cast a look of inquiry at the Princess. \" Come here, Karl,\" she said graciously, in answer to the look. \" You may speak freely before the Lady von Sigismark, who knows what you have come to tell me. Has the King been to see the pretty peasant again to-day?\" \" Yes, your Royal Highness. And, what is more, to-day, for the first time, he did not go alone. He took Herr Bernal with him.\""], [68, "56 A CROWN OF STRAW. The Princess listened to Karl, but addressed her answering remarks to Gertrude. \"Ah, that looks serious. As long as men keep an idea to themselves it may come to nothing, but when they begin to ask the advice of their friends, depend on it they have made up their minds.\" The Princess paused a moment to let her words sink into the girl's mind, and then asked her \u2014 \" Is there anything you would like to ask about, that Karl may be able to tell us ? \" Gertrude looked up, struggling hard to preserve an air of indifference. \" This girl, I suppose you have seen her ? \" she said to the young forester. \" Is she so very beautiful ? \" \"She is, my lady, most beautiful. They call her the Fawn of the Forest. Her hair shines like a sunbeam, and her skin is as soft and pink as the leaf of a wild rose. Every one admires her.\" Hermengarde turned towards the jealous belle with a cruel smile \u2014 \"You see, Gertrude, if even this man is so carried away, what the King must think of her. And she is young, too. Why, you are scarcely twenty, but this girl is some years under you. How old is she, Karl ? \" \" Scarcely seventeen, Madam.\" \" You hear. No wonder my nephew is so fascinated.\" Gertrude was unable to make any reply to these stabs. Karl seized the opportunity of adding a fresh item to his report. \" His Majesty took her a present to-day,\" he observed ;"], [69, "A DOUBLE TRAITOR. 57 \"a brooch set with jewels, which came from Paris this morning.\" \" Did he ? \" The Princess turned again to her victim. \" I think the King once gave you a brooch ? \" \"No, Madam, it was a bracelet,\" answered the girl sullenly, half stifled with mingled shame and anger. Hermengarde saw that she had gone far enough, and dismissed her emissary. \"Thank you, Karl, that will do. Come to me again if you have anything fresh to tell.\" The fellow took himself away, and Hermengarde proceeded to talk seriously to the girl whose mind she had been working upon. \" Listen to me, my dear Gertrude ; I brought that man in because I wanted you to understand for yourself how serious this matter may become. If any one else were concerned I should look upon it as a mere intrigue, but I have the very gravest fears as to what Maximilian may do. He is strange in many ways ; you must have noticed it. Speak freely, have you not sometimes feared of late that he was becoming worse than formerly ? \" This was a bolder hint than she had ventured on with the cautious Chancellor. But Gertrude had not yet been wrought up to the pitch at which she could receive such a suggestion complacently. \" No, surely not, Madam ! \" she exclaimed, in real dismay. \" Surely there is no fear of that kind for the King.\" Hermengarde sighed, and assumed a resigned ex pression."], [70, "58 A CROWN OF STRAW. \"We must always be prepared for the worst,\" she replied. \" I confess I have been a little alarmed for some time. I only hope nothing will happen till my son is older and better fitted to take a public part. By-the-by \" \u2014 she spoke as if desirous to turn the con versation \u2014 \"have you noticed the Prince lately ? He is growing fast, and will soon begin to make a stir among you young ladies. I cannot help thinking he is handsome.\" \" I have not noticed,\" answered Gertrude, absently. \"At least, yes \u2014 I beg your pardon, Madam \u2014 yes, his Highness is certainly much improved.\" \" I should like you to be friends,\" said the Princess, sweetly. \" Be so good as to ring the bell for me, and if Ernest is in the Castle, I will send for him.\" Gertrude obeyed wonderingly, and the page was dis missed in search of the young Prince. \"There is no more refining education for a young man than the society of polished women,\" observed the Princess, with the air of a philosopher. \" I wish I could persuade you to give some of your time occasionally to my bantling, and teach him a little of your own grace.\" Gertrude blushed and bowed low, overwhelmed by such unexpected familiarity on the part of the proud Hermengarde. \"Your condescension overpowers me, Madam,\" she said. \" There is nothing I should think more delightful than to enjoy the society of his Royal Highness.\" \" I know the risk I run,\" returned the Princess, smiling, and shaking her head in an almost playful manner. \" I know how difficult it is for a young man to pass much"], [71, "A DOUBLE TRAITOR. 59 time in your society and come off heart-whole.\" She watched the flush of vanity animate the girl before her, and added thoughtfully, as if speaking to herself: \" After all, the age when royal alliances were of importance to the welfare of kingdoms has passed. Why should we attach so much importance to marriages with foreign royalty? Too often such affairs turn out disastrously for both, while a marriage within the circle of the national nobility would have brought happiness and content.\" Gertrude listened greedily, hardly venturing to believe her ears. Was it possible that the royal Hermengarde, the haughtiest princess in all Germany, in whose eyes the Hohenzollerns were parvenus, and who was accus tomed to speak of the Guelphs as bourgeois, was now actually contemplating with indifference the possibility of her son marrying a mere private noblewoman, and was even hinting that she should feel no great dis pleasure if she, Gertrude von Sigismark, turned out to be the lucky bride ! Before she could reduce her thoughts to clearness, the door was opened by a tall, slim lad of fifteen or sixteen, who stood awkwardly on the threshold, looking into the room, his figure slightly stooped, and his dark eyes fixed with an inscrutable expression, from which dread was not entirely absent, upon the Princess Hermengarde. The Princess caught sight of him, and a smile of fondness softened the asperity of her features. \" Well, Ernest, come in and pay your respects to this young lady,\" she exclaimed encouragingly. \" You"], [72, "60 A CROWN OF STRAW. surely know the Lady Gertrude von Sigismark well enough ? \" The lad moved forward, shuffling his feet rather nervously as he walked. Gertrude went half-way to meet him, and made as if she would have carried the young Prince's extended hand to her lips. But this Hermengarde would not permit. \" For shame, Ernest ! Where is your gallantry ? If any hand is to be kissed, it should be the Lady Ger trude's. Come, my boy, look into her face. You are old enough to say whether it is worth looking at.\" The Prince lifted his eyes reluctantly as high as the girl's chin, and responded ungraciously \u2014 \" I don't know \u2014 yes, I suppose so.\" \" Fie ! \" exclaimed Hermengarde, laughing at the boy's seriousness. \" Is that the way you pay compli ments to ladies? It is time we took him in hand, Gertrude, and trained him to be more polite.\" But Gertrude skilfully covered her momentary chagrin. \"I think you are unjust to the Prince, Madam,\" she responded. \" A compliment paid after some considera tion is all the more valuable.\" \" Mother,\" broke in the boy, \" can I go for my ride in the park now ? \" \" I dare say you can ; but why are you in such a hurry to leave us ? Perhaps Lady Gertrude is interested in horses. Ask her.\" Ernest turned to the girl as if his own interest in her had been quickened by the suggestion, and put the question in his own words \u2014"], [73, "A DOUBLE TRAITOR. 61 \" Are you ? Do you ever ride ? \" \" I am very fond of horses,\" answered Gertrude, with her most ingratiating smile ; \" and I ride whenever I can get a cavalier to escort me.\" \" There is a chance for you ! \" cried Hermengarde to her son, pleased to see how quickly Gertrude had fallen into her new part. \"You are in luck this afternoon. Quick, ask her if she will share your ride.\" Thus prompted, the Prince had no option but to comply, though he did not throw much heartiness into his invitation. But Gertrude showed enough alacrity for both. \" I shall be delighted with the honour, Prince, if you do not mind waiting while I put on my habit.\" \" Don't be long, then,\" was the boy's response. Gertrude, with a swift reverence to the Princess, darted away to get ready, and surprised and annoyed Von Stahlen, who had returned to the ante-room to wait for her, by sweeping past him with the bare announcement that she was going to ride with Prince Ernest. The Count sat silent and motionless in his chair for fully twenty minutes after this snub, and then turned to the patiently expectant Von Hardenburg and launched this withering remark \u2014 \" I thought it was time for the Princess Hermengarde to engage a nurse for her baby.\" In the mean time, as soon as the door closed upon Gertrude, the Princess Hermengarde had called Ernest to her side, and lovingly laid her hand upon his fore head."], [74, "62 A CROWN OF STRAW. \" When shall I live to see that curly head wearing a crown ? \" she murmured fondly. The boy drew back and frowned. \"I do not want to be king,\" he said in a decided voice. \"Besides, I love Cousin Maximilian, and I do not want him to die. Don't you love him ? \" \" Of course I do,\" responded Hermengarde, soothingly, regarding her son nevertheless with an anxious look. \" But you should not say that you do not want to be king, my boy. Above all, be careful not to talk like that with any one but me ; you cannot tell what harm it might do. Your cousin Maximilian is not strong, and a thousand things might happen to bring you to the throne.\" The boy pouted sullenly. \"Why doesn't Maximilian marry?\" he grumbled. \" Am I the only heir ? \" \" You are the only near one. You have a distant cousin, Count von Eisenheim, but he is hardly to be reckoned among the Franconian royal family. Do not speak as if you shrank from your destiny, Ernest. Maximilian will never marry \u2014 I tell you as a secret \u2014 never. It is for you to marry, and one of these days, when you are a little older, I will talk to you about your beautiful cousin, Louisa of Schwerin-Strelitz. In the mean time, the less you speak about these things the better. Only be careful to show yourself gracious to Lady Gertrude, and also to her father, the Chancellor.\" \" But I do not like him,\" remonstrated Prince Ernest. \" He is disagreeable ; he stares at me when he meets me, in a way I do not like.\""], [75, "A DOUBLE TRAITOR. 63 \" Nonsense, child, that is your fancy. Besides, if it were true, that would be all the more reason you should be civil and pleasant to him. Mark my words, before long you will find him very friendly. Now run away, and see that the horses are ready for your ride.\" The boy needed no second bidding. He sprang to the door, and Hermengarde, left to her own thoughts, settled down into her favourite seat beside the window, with a pondering look upon her brow. While these shadowy intrigues were taking place in one corner of the palace, in another quarter of the same building a very different plot was making headway. The connecting link between the two was Karl. When the young forester returned to his room in the royal corridor, to his astonishment, he found a visitor awaiting him. A tall, dark man, a few years older than himself, was seated on a chair, with his arms folded, in an attitude of quiet resolution. He looked up at Karl's entrance, but made no other movement. \"Who are you?\" demanded the favourite. \"How did you come here? \" \" I came here easily enough,\" replied the stranger, coolly. \" I told the people below that I was your brother. Perhaps you have forgotten the brotherhood between us.\" Karl's face fell, and he gazed uneasily at the bronzed features of his visitor, who returned his stare with calm unconcern. \"I do not recognize you,\" he faltered. \"What is your name, and what do you want here ? \""], [76, "64 A CROWN OF STRAW. \"My name is Johann Mark!\" Karl uttered a sharp cry. \" And I want your aid to gain me a private interview with King Maximilian.\" The young courtier began to change colour, and his limbs trembled. Dropping all further question as to his visitor's right to be there, he asked anxiously \u2014 \"What is it you want with the King?\" \" Everything. Be wise, ask no more questions.\" \" I dare not do what you ask. You have no right to expect it of me. I am a loyal servant of the King.\" \" Loyal ? \" He pronounced the word with an intense scorn. \" Karl Fink loyal ! Come, speak out ; how much must I give you to conceal me in some place where Maximilian will be likely to pass alone ? \" \" Nothing. It is no use to tempt me. I will not. I dare not.\" Johann's look became threatening. \" Sit down,\" he said. \" I see that I must talk to you. I must remind you of some things that you have for gotten \u2014 things that happened before you turned a courtier. You lie under the misfortune of having had a moment of courage in your past, Karl \u2014 a fit of manly independence. You were whipped into it, I think, by old King Leopold ; and in that fit you fled to Stuttgart.\" Karl interrupted. He had grown very pale, and his teeth were almost chattering. \"Don't speak of that,\" he implored. \"Don't remind me of that.\" \" I must remind you,\" was the deliberate answer. \" I must remind you of a certain meeting-place behind the Arsenal.\""], [77, "A DOUBLE TRAITOR. 65 \" Hush ! Not so loud, for God's sake ! \" Johann returned a contemptuous smile, and continued in the same tone \u2014 \"I must remind you of a certain brotherhood com posed of other Franconians who had felt the weight of Leopold's hand, and of a night when a certain youth was initiated and swore \u2014 do you recollect the oath ? \" \" I recollect too much. In mercy do not keep dwell ing on that.\" \"Well, since you recollect it, I will pass on. Your comrades have been dispersed since then, Karl, but they have not forgotten you. We have watched your career with interest. We have seen you return to your old pursuits, and escape this time without a whipping. We have even watched you entering the palace, and becoming the favourite \u2014 valet, is it, or groom ? \u2014 of the young King. We gave you credit for good motives. We said to ourselves \u2014 ' He has gone in there to be in a position to serve us when the time comes.' For that reason we spared you, Karl. We have left you alone all this time because we had no need of your services. Now we have need of them. What do you say ? Are you prepared to serve us ? \" The unfortunate forester had listened to this biting speech in stony silence. But at its close he roused him self for a last effort, and angrily replied \u2014 \" By what right do you make these demands on me ? Oh, I know ; I have felt this coming all along. All these years the remembrance of that wretched act of folly has overhung me like a storm-cloud, and I have never risen in the morning without wondering whether it would F"], [78, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 66 burst before night.

I tell you that you are worse tyrants yourselves than any of those you conspire against. Look at me. I am happy here ; King Maximilian has done me no harm, he has shown me every favour ; I have lost all the inclinations that made me join you ten years ago, I have forgotten you, and only desire to be left in peace. And yet you track me down like bloodhounds, and order me to risk my neck at your bidding. What could be worse tyranny than that ? \" Johann had listened perfectly unmoved to the other's passionate protests. He hardly deigned to answer them. \" It is a case of tyranny against tyranny. There is no such thing as free will in this world, Karl. Kings use their weapons, and we use ours. They have their troops, their judges, their spies. We have our oaths and our daggers. If we are dealing with men of ignoble minds that can only be swayed by selfish considera tions we have to employ the arguments that appeal to them. If kings use bribes, we must use threats.\" He paused, and for some moments nothing more was said. Then Johann spoke again \u2014 \"After all, we do not really ask very much of you- In enterprises of this kind a faint-hearted ally is more dangerous than an enemy. All I want of you .is to place me somewhere where I may meet the King. You"], [79, "A DOUBLE TRAITOR. 67 can go where you like, and no one need know that you Avere concerned in the affair.\" \" What is it that you mean to do ? \" demanded Karl sullenly. For answer Johann thrust his hand into an inner pocket of his coat, and produced a pistol, at the sight of which the other man recoiled, Avith a fresh cry. \" I think you know this pistol. I think the last time it was loaded you held it in your hand. You had been chosen by the lot to fire it then : I have been chosen now.\" \" But then it was loaded for Leopold, and he is dead,\" urged the trembling Karl. \" True, and therefore this time it has been loaded for Maximilian. What is there in that to surprise you ? \" \" But what has he done ? His fancies are harmless ; he is not bad and cruel ; if he does no good he does no evil ; he goes on his own way and leaves the people alone.\" \" The fancies of kings are never harmless,\" replied Johann sternly. And rising to his feet, to give more emphasis to his language, he went on in the tone of a man who feels deeply every word he says : \" Not to do good is in itself a crime on the part of the ruler. How many men in Maximilian's position, with his power to bless mankind, Avould make a paradise of Franconia! It is not only the active ill-doer that we have to war against ; we must cut down the barren fig-tree as well. No ; let a king be kingly, let him be a father to his people, let him comfort them in their sorrows, teach them in their ignorance ; let him protect the poor from the spoliations"], [80, "68 A CROWN OF STRAW. of the rich, provide openings for labour in public works for the benefit of the whole nation, feed the hungry, build hospitals for the infirm, give homes to the aged ; let him come down into the arena and fight his people's battle ; let him be our example, and our guide to lead us on, or let him cease to reign ! \" Another silence folloAved, broken only by the uneasy fidgeting of Karl upon his seat, as he tried to think of some Avay of escape from his position. At last Johann put a stop to his hesitation. \" Come,\" he said sternly, \" no more delay. It is your life or his. Take me to the place where I can carry out my errand or \" The wretched minion rose up shuddering, and led the way out of the room."], [81, "69 CHAPTER V. JOHANN'S MISSION. Treading cautiously for fear of being overheard by any chance passer-by, Karl led his master's enemy down the corrider giving on to the royal apartments, and out into a spacious gallery Avhich ran across the whole southern side of the Castle, and connected its two Avings. This gallery was almost turned into a con servatory, by the whole of one side being given up to a roAv of windoAvs so large and near together as to make the wall appear one expanse of glass. Along the floor, in front of these windows, ran a series of blossom ing shrubs, bright-hued azaleas, or sweetly scented lemon and myrtle, giving the whole place a fresh and romantic air. In this gallery it was Maximilian's custom to stroll towards the evening, sometimes alone, but oftener accompanied by a chosen friend. In a few Avords Karl explained the situation to Johann, and then hurried away, sick at heart, leaving the conspirator to conceal himself at his leisure behind the foliage of the plants."], [82, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 70 It is hardly necessary to add much to the reasons given by Johann for his presence in the Castle. He had come there as the emissary of the society to which he referred in his conversation Avith Karl, a society founded ten years before, in the reign of Leopold IX. Originally the society had consisted of five persons. Of these one Avas dead. Another had long since made a home in the United States of America. The third was he Avho had taken advantage of the old king's death to abandon the paths of conspiracy, and had become the servant and confidant cf Leopold's successor. Two of the original members still remained : one, a man remarkable for his size and for his thick red beard, had succeeded to the post of president ; the other was Johann himself. For some years after Maximilian's accession the Avork of the society had seemed at a standstill. But it is a truth often illustrated in history that the spirit of revolt engendered by the oppressions of a strong bad king breaks out under the rule of a mild but Aveak successor. Maximilian's offence towards his subjects had been simple indifference. A dreamer and a poet, he had shown himself utterly averse to the practical business of kingship, and, absorbed in his \u00e6sthetic pursuits, he had left the cares of government to his Chancellor. While the Minister Avas engaged in levying taxes, and keeping a tight rein on public opinion, the young King was Avithdrawing himself from the sight of his subjects, and spending his time in some distant hunting-lodge Avith a few favourite companions, or perhaps assisting at the production, on a lavish scale, of one of those"], [83, "JOHANN'S MISSION. 71 operas Avhich Avere beginning to make his intimate friend Bernal celebrated throughout Europe. It was not long before these caprices began to take an extravagant turn, Avhich gave an opening for the public discontent. Once a fancy seized Maximilian, he never stopped to count the cost, and his Ministers found that the best Avay to preserve their power was to furnish him ungrudgingly Avith the funds required to satisfy his Avhims. It Avas natural that the revolutionary party should seize on this ground of attack, and hold up the thoughtless young King as a vampire, draining the life blood of the people to supply his selfish luxuries. Matters had just been brought to a head by Maximilian's last crowning extravagance, the celebrated palace of Seidlingen. Seidlingen had been over three years in preparation. Riding one day in the mountains Avhich border the north-west of Franconia, the King had come upon a beautiful little valley shut in on all sides by lofty hills. In the middle of the valley lay a deep blue lake, several miles in extent, overshadowed by the mountains, and bordered by dark pine forests. Charmed with the romantic situation, Maximilian had conceived the idea of erecting a palace on the very edge of the lake, and transforming the valley into a veritable fairy kingdom, in which he might roam undisturbed. How many millions had actually been spent in realizing this splendid dream were not accurately known. It was supposed that the Ministers, afraid to disclose the truth, had distributed a large part of the cost among various heads of civil and military expenditure. All that public"], [84, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 72 opinion could do was to take note of the colossal works involved, and from them to arrive at some estimate of the appalling cost. It Avas known that thousands of men had been at work in the lovely valley. Part of the mountain had been levelled to obtain a site for the palace and the extensive gardens which spread away from the border of the lake. Another part had been cut away to make room for a magnificent road, broad and smooth as the boulevards of a capital, and bordered Avith trees and waterfalls and vistas of artificially embellished land scape. In one place an immense stretch of forest had to be cleared ; in another, huge trees, selected for their size and beauty, had to be transplanted from distant regions. The Avhole of the lake, some ten or twelve square miles of Avater, had first to be drained away that its bed might be deepened and cleansed from Aveeds, and then to be refilled, and kept at a constant high level by means of immense dams of masonry, and by the construction of artificial water-courses, and the laying of miles of underground pipes. Its Avaters had to be stocked Avith rare fish from all the rivers of Europe and America, and its banks to be lined here and there Avith costly marble quays, to facilitate landing from the sumptuous pleasure craft, built of priceless AA-oods, Avhich Avere transported thither across the mountains. A net- Avork of canals, lined Avith marble, ran through the gardens, and on their smooth Avaters exquisite boats inlaid Avith ivory, and shaped like swans and dolphins, glided past Chinese toAvers, and kiosks, and crystal caves from which concealed musicians Avere to pour out"], [85, "JOHANN'S MISSION. 73 melodies upon the voyager's ear. At one time it had actually been in contemplation to connect these canals with a larger one extending the whole way to the river Rhine, but another kingdom had to be crossed, and the compensation demanded by its government was so enormous that even Maximilian stopped short, and the dream of making a seaport in the heart of the German highlands was abandoned. All that art could desire or science execute had been done to render the palace itself one of the wonders of the Avorld. In mere size it Avas inferior to the state palace in Mannhausen, far inferior to such huge piles as Versailles and the Roman Vatican. A poet does not build like a conqueror. Maximilian's object had not been to stupefy mankind, but to delight himself. Almost more Avealth had been lavished on the Avonderful accessories than on the main edifice \u2014 that is to say, on the aviaries, the hothouses, and above all on the unique and gorgeous theatre destined for the production of the grandest Avorks of Mozart and Beethoven and Bernal. But it Avas in the beauty of its design, and the perfec tion of its finish, that Seidlingen rose superior to every other palace on the globe. The barrack-like stateliness of Potsdam, the homely majesty of Windsor, were alike put out of the comparison. It was the complete and final fusion of the medi\u00e6val and the classic, a Gothic castle breathed upon by the spirit of the Renaissance, and transformed into a dazzling temple of art. Beneath stretched broad terraces and solemn colonnades, above soared fairy-like turrets and thin spires of delicate tracery. It was the beauty and glory of the South,"], [86, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 74 brooded over by the deep immortal spirit of the North. And noAV the rumour ran that Seidlingen Avas finished, and that the King Avas about to go and take possession. This Avas the signal for the discontent, which had long been gathering head, to break into a ferment. The revolutionary societies redoubled their activity, recruits came flocking to them in shoals, and already the more daring minds spoke of open insurrection against the royal Government. It only remained for some one man, more daring than the rest, to give the signal of revolt. This Avas the crisis for which Johann had long been Avaiting. He called together the members of his own brotherhood, and producing the very Aveapon Avhich had been provided ten years before for the assassina tion of Leopold, boldly demanded that it should be loaded once more. His comrades consented, and by his OAvn desire he Avas entrusted Avith the carrying out of the society's sentence. The daAvn of the following day saw him set forth from Mannhausen, carrying in his breast the sealed pistol, and bound for the place Avhere the Court Avas then in residence. Stopping on his Avay at Franz Gitten's cottage, what he had learned there confirmed his resolution, and he had come away armed, as he believed, Avith a fresh justification for the deed he Avas going to commit. He had hardly settled himself in Avhat seemed to be a secure hiding-place, Avhen a door opened at the far end of the gallery, and Maximilian and Bernal entered arm-in-arm."], [87, "JOHANN'S MISSION. 75 The King had discarded the dress he had worn for his walk through the forest, and Avas now clad in a plain suit of black velvet, trimmed with deep lace ruffles at the throat and wrists. The only mark of his rank AA-as a small cap of the same stuff Avhich he wore, Avhile his companion Avas bare-headed. As if he had changed his mood Avith his clothes, the young man came in laughing and rallying his friend. \" Why, Auguste, what nonsense you talk! Did you hear Von Stahlen's latest? He declares that the Steinketel has jilted me! He thinks I have been cut out by Von Hardenburg. It is lucky that Seidlingen Avill be ready for me to retire to, to hide my despair.\" Auguste did not seem quite to share his friend's cheerfulness. \"I suppose you have no idea what your fairy-land has actually cost,\" he observed. \" I cannot help fearing it Avill make you unpopular Avith the nation.\" Maximilian laughed. \"I see Avhat it is,\" he retorted lightly; \"you have been reading the newspapers. I never do, not even the Cologne Gazette. My dear Auguste, if you are going to take life seriously, all confidence betAveen us must be at an end. Remember that I am the King of the Fairies, and my politics are those of A Midsummer Night's Dream ! \" Auguste smiled rather half-heartedly. \"That is all very Avell, Max, but you know the inhabitants of Franconia are not fairies, and the taxes they have to pay are not fairy gold.\" \" My dear friend, I really believe that you have turned"], [88, "76 A CROWN OF STRAW. Republican. I shall hear next that you are a candidate for the Chamber on the Opposition side. What are the Franconians to you, or to me either? Philistines all, my friend, Philistines all. I look upon myself as a divinely appointed instrument of retribution. I am the avenger of the poets they have imprisoned, and the musicians they have insulted, and the painters they have starved. Let them pay their taxes. It is the only homage to genius they have ever rendered. I am the only prophet who has ever been honoured in his own country, and they honour me because they have to. Make your mind easy ; and Avhen Ave get to the Happy Valley Ave will lock the gates and give orders that no newspapers are to be admitted except that one at Athens which is published in verse!\" Auguste shook his head. \" It is lucky for you that the Chancellor takes the business of government a little more seriously. What Avould you do if a revolutionary mob invaded your Happy Valley ? \" \"Offer them refreshments, of course, and then make them listen to one of your operas. If that did not subdue their fierceness, nothing Avould,\" added Maxi milian, unable to resist the temptation to banter his friend. \" But tell me, Auguste, do you seriously suppose that any one wants to deprive me of the throne in savour of poor Ernest?\" Bernal did not at once reply to this question. While the two had been talking they had continued to stroll up and down the gallery, and in letting his eyes Avander from side to side, the musician had caught sight through"], [89, "JOHANN'S MISSION. 77 the gathering dusk of something which he fancied to be unusual in the appearance of one of the shrubs before the AvindoAvs. Restraining his curiosity for the moment, he Avalked on, and as Maximilian Avas Avaiting, he forced himself to return some ansAver. \"I am afraid that is not the question. You may have enemies Avhose designs go farther than a mere change of masters. Be serious for one moment, Max. Other kings have to take precautions to guard them selves, and Avhy should not you do the same ? \" \" Oh, that Avill be all right. You will find that Seid lingen is well guarded, though it has been more Avith the idea of keeping out impertinent admirers than the mysterious enemies you talk about. I have had a palisade put up all round the mountains, and at every mile or so I shall have small pickets of troops, whose duty it will be to patrol the boundary, and see that no one attempts to cross. There is only one road leading into the valley, the one I have had made, and that will be guarded at the entrance by a small fort pierced by an iron gate, Avhich will be kept locked, and only opened by a written order from me or the Chancellor. So you see the Anarchists won't have much chance to disturb us.\" While he was speaking, they had strolled back till they again came opposite the spot Avhich had attracted the musician's attention. He contrived to gradually bring himself to a halt, Maximilian folloAving his ex ample without perceiving that his companion's move ments were governed by any special purpose. Bernal"], [90, "78 A CROWN OF STRAW. fixed his gaze upon a dark shadow under the foliage, Avhile Maximilian continued to speak. \"The real difficulty I shall have,\" he said, \"is to avoid the visits of persons Avho cannot very Avell be turned back by a sentry. I am afraid from Avhat I hear that my preparations have roused the curiosity of the Kaiser, and that his Imperial Majesty is likely to inflict his formidable presence on me, unless I can think of some pretext for keeping him away.\" Bernal still listened, but the King's Avords fell dully on his car. His Avhole attention Avas absorbed by a frightful discovery. Gazing steadfastly into the shadow, he had all at once become aAvare that his look Avas returned. There, at a distance of a feAv feet from him, Avas a pair of dark eyes fixed deliberately upon his oavii. By a tremendous effort of will he suppressed all out- ward signs of agitation, lest he should alarm the man before him, and continued to gaze calmly back, as if unconscious of Avhat he saAv. His thoughts, travelling Avith terrific rapidity, went over the dangers of the situation. The King and himself Avere totally un- armed, they were alone in the gallery, and, thanks to Maximilian's morbid love of privacy, there Avere no attendants likely to be within hail. Who could the concealed watcher be ? Only a desperate man Avould have dared to risk the danger of thus invading the royal apartments in a way which sufficiently proclaimed the threatening character of his errand. If this man were armed, the King's life, both their lives, Avere at his mercy. The only chance of escape that presented itself to Bernal's mind, was to feign unconsciousness, and draw"], [91, "JOHANN'S MISSION. 79 the King gradually aAvay to the end of the gallery. Then, by a sudden movement, he could urge him through the doorway, and fasten it against the enemy. With a strange feeling of dizziness creeping over him, he contrived to say a few Avords in answer to his companion. \"That is Avhat I Avas afraid you Avould say. If the Kaiser is really anxious to come, in your own interest you ought to make him welcome, and show him every attention. He may be a useful friend or a dangerous foe.\" He Avas quite unconscious Avhether he was talking sense or nonsense ; as long as he could maintain the appearance of composure it Avas all he cared for. Maximilian, wholly unsuspicious, launched out into a reply. \" My dear Auguste, you are talking like old Von Sigismark. Of course, all that is very true ; but it is no reason why I should submit to the penalty of that barbarian's presence, if there is any reasonable Avay of avoiding it. I come to you for sympathy, not for good advice.\" As he finished speaking, Bernal felt a sudden shock. Still gazing into the depths of those flaming eyes, he had become aware by some subtle instinct that the man lurking in the shadoAV knew that he was detected. There was only one moment's more breathing-time, till the assassin should learn that this knowledge in turn had been discovered by his observer. Trembling under the imminence of the peril, Bernal felt irritated at having to reply to the King, as a man"], [92, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 80 racked by some torturing pain resents having to respond to the commonplace observations of those around him. \" I never talk like Von Sigismark. I simply meant that if there were no way of avoiding it, you should submit with as much grace as possible.\" Maximilian smiled at the peevishness of his friend's tone. \"You are a Job's comforter, Auguste. If you say much more I shall make you my Chancellor ; so be careful.\" \" Ah ! \" The crisis had come. A flash of the eyes Avhich he had been Avatching Avith such feverish anxiety, con vinced Bernal that the last stage had been arrived at. The enemy had already learned that Bernal had detected him. He now kneAV that Bernal Avas aware of this. The fence of eyes was over. The tAvo Avere as much face to face as if both Avere out in the middle of the apartment. Bernal set his teeth together and drew back a step, while Johann sprang to his feet, threw doAvn the shrub Avhich had protected him, and levelled his pistol at the distance of four paces, at the King's breast. \" If either of you moves or makes the least cry, I fire.\""], [93, "81 CHAPTER VI. KING AND REGICIDE. None of us know beforehand how Ave shall act in moments of stress and fear. Bernal, Avhen he saAv em bodied before him the danger to Avhich he had looked fonvard, lost his self-control, and turned round to the King Avith a nervous movement, as if he would catch hold of him to restrain him from hasty action. But Maximilian, after the first natural start of astonishment, stood perfectly still, his eyes fixed steadily on this man Avho had suddenly come forward to threaten his life, gazing at him Avith more of curiosity than dread. The intruder stepped nearer, keeping his Aveapon pointed at the King, Avhile his finger pressed against the trigger. Nevertheless, he did not at once fire. To kill in cold blood is hard. And the republican, on his part, Avas not free from some natural feeling of curiosity as he looked for the first time on this scion of a race against Avhich he had SAVorn vows of hatred. \" Have you anything to say before I sire ? \" he asked, unconsciously seeking to gain time to strengthen his resolve. G"], [94, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 82 Maximilian dreAV himself up with a proud gesture. The softer side of his character seemed to have sud denly died out. In the presence of this enemy he was every inch a King. \"Why have you come here?\" he demanded, as haughtily as if he had been surrounded by his guards, and the man before him had been a defenceless prisoner. \" What is it that you Avant ? \" \" You see plainly enough. I am here to kill you.\" Bernal could not restrain a stifled cry. Maximilian lifted his hand sternly to enjoin silence, Avithout removing his eyes from the enemy's face. \" Why do you Avish to take my life ? \" he asked, in a firm voice. Johann had to pause and collect his thoughts before he could ansAver. He felt ever so slightly disconcerted. The situation Avas altogether unlike Avhat he had antici pated. He had come there breathing wrath against one Avhom he pictured as a Heliogabalus, dissolved in vice and luxury, and he had steeled himself beforehand against threats or bribes or prayers for mercy ; and now, here he Avas face to face Avith a pale, thoughtful eyed young man, whose principal feeling seemed to be Avonder, tempered Avith indignation, at his presence. \"Because you are a king,\" he said at length, speaking slowly, and trying to rouse his dormant anger as he went along. \" You hold the supreme power in the country. For ten years you have reigned over Fran conia ; and hoAv have you used your power ? For the gratification of your own selfish pleasures. While the poor starve in your capital, you waste millions in"], [95, "KING AND REGICIDE. 83 luxury. You build neAv palaces ; you lavish favours on artists and musicians\" \u2014 he glanced at Bernal as he spoke \u2014 \"your whole time is given up to enjoyment, and you have never given a moment's thought to the Avelfare of the millions whom you call your subjects. You value operas more than the lives of men.\" He stopped, feeling slightly dissatisfied Avith the Aveakness of his language. He Avould have liked to crush this calm, dignified questioner with a few scathing Avords \u2014 but somehoAV the words had refused to come. Maximilian answered him with spirit. \" I do not believe that any one need starve in Fran conia. You are speaking unfairly. If I spend money in the ways you talk of, does it not all come back into the pockets of the people ? I never heard that it was considered a crime to encourage art, or that a king was forbidden to have his private friends. And when you accuse me of not valuing the lives of men, you forget that during my reign Franconia has been kept from war. None of my subjects have been made to shed one drop of blood for me. I have never even signed a death- Avarrant.\" \" What does that matter ? I am not speaking of foreign Avar. The deadliest Avar is that which goes on from day to day between rich and poor ; and that war you have never lifted a finger to check. The millions you have wasted on palaces \u2014 Avhich are of no use to any one but yourself \u2014 might have been used for great public Avorks for the benefit of mankind \u2014 hospitals, almshouses, bridges, aqueducts to bring the pure water of the hills into the Mannhausen slums. A king has"], [96, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 84 higher duties than encouraging art. It is his duty to be the shepherd of the nation he rules.\" Maximilian listened, this time Avith an air of interest. He replied in milder and more friendly tones than he had yet used. \" I think I understand you. I see that there is some thing in Avhat you say. I have been too much in the habit of thinking that the best king Avas the one Avho interfered with his subjects least. You will admit, at all events, that I have never tried to play the tyrant. But I see that I might have done something more \u2014 such things as you point out. Yet the people have a constitution. Why have their elected representatives not undertaken some of these Avorks? \" Johann hardly kneAV hoAv to reply to this gentle reasoning on the part of the man Avhom he had come to take vengeance upon. He tried to convince himself that this Avas mere acting \u2014 a mere ruse to gain time, and he spoke again more angrily than before. \" That is right ; lay the blame on others. Where is the money for such things to come from, Avhen every penny that can be wrung out of the people is being squandered by you ? Besides, these representatives, as you call them, represent only the richer classes. They are as much out of touch Avith the poor, they have as little sympathy Avith them, as you. Their turn will come before long ; in the mean time Ave must begin at the head. These excuses come too late. You have had ten years in Avhich to shoAV your good intentions, and noAV Ave can Avait no longer.\" Maximilian resumed his haughty air."], [97, "KING AND REGICIDE. 85 \" I did not mean to make excuses, sir. I thought you Avere speaking sincerely, and I meant to do the same. But, since you have made up your mind already, this conversation is useless. You had better fire that pistol.\" Johann felt a sensation of shame, coupled with an unsatisfactory doubt as to whether he had rightly judged the young man Avhose life he was about to take. With out removing his finger from the trigger, he slightly lowered the pistol, and responded. \" I can fire as soon as there is the least danger of interruption. But I have not come here to insult you. You asked me Avhy I wished to take your life, and I have told you. I do not accuse you of wilfully injuring the people, but of neglecting your duties towards them for the sake of your own pleasures. You say that the best king is the one Avho leaves his people alone. In that case we do not need a king at all. Why should Ave spend millions of money on a useless orna ment ? No, Ave are sick of the Avhole system. We have made up our minds to teach rulers their duty, whether they be kings or presidents or prime ministers. So long as there is one wretched man in this country whose Avretchedness you have the power to cure, and you do not use that power, you are guilty in the sight of God and man. I have lived among the people all these years, while you have been dreaming of art and palaces. I have seen their misery, I have heard their prayers, Avhich there has been no one to ansAver. There must be an end to all this. If motives of compassion have no force, if appeals to justice are useless, we must appeal"], [98, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 86 o fear. We must terrify governments into doing their duty ; we must teach them that neglect may make the wretched dangerous, that misery breeds assassins.\" His eyes flashed, and his form grew more erect under the inspiration of his OAvn fierce language. For the first time the young King drooped his head. \"I do not blame you,\" he answered mildly; \"you have made me realize your point of view better than I have ever done before. Only you talk as if the task of grappling Avith these evils Avere an easy one, Avhile to me it seems very hard. Suppose we could change places, and you Avere King for the next six months, Iioav Avould you set to work to remedy it ? \" This unexpected suggestion fairly took the republican aback. He had to consider before he replied. \" To me the idea of kingship is repugnant I could not rule except by the consent of the people. My first step Avould be to lay down the crown, and organize a Republican government.\" \"And Prussia?\" suggested Maximilian. \"Suppose half a million troops Avere marched across the border to suppress your Republic and set up a new king ? \" Johann bit his lip. For the moment he could think of no ansAver. Maximilian pursued his advantage. The shock of peril seemed to have stimulated his mind and giA-en him umvonted energy. He Avent on, speaking clearly and earnestly \u2014 \"See here, sir. If I thought you believed in my sincerity I would make a proposition to you. I Avould ask you to release me on parole for six months, and"], [99, "KING AND REGICIDE. 87 during that time you should take my place, and run the government on your own lines. At the end of the six months we Avould come back here, to this gallery, exactly as we are now. I would put that pistol into your hand, still loaded, and you should then decide Avhether to fire it or not, as you pleased.\" The revolutionist heard this proposal with feelings of almost ludicrous dismay. He realized that the ground Avas being cut from under him. \"But it Avould be impossible,\" he objected Aveakly. \" Such an arrangement could never be carried out. Your Court, your Ministers, Avould all refuse to recognize me. I could accomplish nothing.\" \"Not by yourself, I admit. But I did not mean that you should take my place quite literally. What I meant was that you should in effect use my authority, such as it is. You have condemned me, no doubt justly, for not making a good use of my power.

If you accept my offer I Avill provide rooms in the Castle for you ; you shall stay here in some nominal capacity \u2014 as my private secretary, for instance \u2014 or, if you prefer it, simply as my guest. You shall then put your ideas into shape ; every suggestion Avhich you make I will lay before my Ministers as if it came from myself; and you shall be present at our consultations, and judge for yourself Avhat are the powers of a king, and how far they can be exercised for the good of the people. At the end of that time, as I have said, we shall return exactly to our"], [100, "88 A CROWN OF STRAW. former positions, and perhaps you will then understand me better than you do noAV. What do you say ? Will you accept my offer? \" Bernal, Avho had been a silent but deeply interested listener to this debate, hardly knew Avhether to regard Maximilian's scheme as a serious outcome of his ideal istic nature, or as a bold and skilful man\u0153uvre to outAvit the revolutionist. He looked anxiously at Johann to see \\A'hat impression had been produced on him by the King's proposal. But Johann Avas himself too much of a Quixote to suspect that he stood in the presence of a Machiavelli. Completely vanquished by the King's magnanimity, he Avas about to throw doAvn his Aveapon, Avhen all at once a fresh thought struck him. He had just remembered the forester's daughter. \"Wait,\" he said sternly, bending an angry look upon Maximilian. \" I have another account to settle Avith you. This time it is not a question of neglecting your subjects, but of taking too much interest in them. We have met once to-day already. I saAv you leave Franz Gitten's lodge.\" Maximilian drew back, mortified at his rebuff. At Johann's last AA'ords an exclamation of annoyance burst from him. So his secret had been discovered, and by this violent man. Misinterpreting the exclamation as a sign of guilt, the other proceeded to a denunciation. \"Yes; not satisfied Avith all that your boasted art can do for you, you must stoop to prey on the virtue of an innocent young girl, whose only crime is the"], [101, "KING AND REGICIDE. 89 poverty Avhich leaves her defenceless to your guilty passions.\" He stopped, astonished at the effect produced by his Avords. Maximilian, his whole face flushed with righteous anger, silenced him Avith an imperious gesture, and replied Avarmly \u2014 \u25a0 Not another Avord ! You insult that noble young girl as much as me by your suspicions. I SAvear to you that I have never said one evil word, nor harboured one impure thought toAvards her. I love her as sincerely as you have ever loved \u2014 if you ever did love any one. Ask the Herr Bernal there, and he will tell you that this very evening on our Avay home, I informed him that I contemplated making Dorothea my Avise.\" Johann stared at him like one transfixed. \" Dorothea ! My cousin ! \" Avas all he could utter. \"Your cousin ! \" came as a simultaneous exclamation from the lips of both the others. ' A profound silence succeeded. Maximilian was the first to speak. Turning to his friend, he said mourn fully\u2014 \" You see, Auguste, my foreboding was true. Now she Avill know I am the King, and perhaps she will never learn to love me after all.\" Johann hung his head, and let the pistol drop from his passive fingers on to the floor.

Seize him!\" cried the Chancellor, pointing to Johann. Johann made a quick movement as if to pick up his fallen Aveapon, Avhen Maximilian bent fonvard and whispered to him \u2014 I give you my parole.\" The next instant a dozen eager hands Avere clutching at the conspirator on all sides, and Von Sigismark's voice rang out \u2014 \"Take him away, and chain him in the strongest room in the Castle.\" Before the soldiers had time to do anything, a counter order came sternly and proudly from the lips of the King. \" Stop ! Release your prisoner. He has our pardon.\" The Chancellor made a step forward, dismay and incredulity written on his face. \" Pardon me, Sire,\" he ventured to remonstrate, \" but this man came here Avith the intention of assassinating you. See, there is his pistol on the floor.\" Hearing the Chancellor's words, one or tAvo of the soldiers thought fit to retain their hold of the prisoner, till they saw Avhat Avould come of it.

The unexpected interruption to the scene between Maximilian and the intended assassin Avas due to the tardy repentance of Karl Fink. On leaving Johann in the gallery he had retired at first to his OAvn room, Avhere he flung himself on the bed, and lay Avrithing in misery, straining his ears for the sound of the pistol's fire. At one moment he pictured to himself the arrest of the murderer, followed perhaps by a denunciation of himself as the accomplice ; at another his thoughts reverted to the many acts of kindness shoAvn him by his young master, and he groaned aloud in remorse for his betrayal. As the minutes slipped by and he heard nothing, a gleam of fresh hope stole into his mind. It might not be too late even now to interfere and save the King's life. In that case he thought he kneAV Maximilian Avell enough to be secure of forgiveness for his previous treachery. Inspired with sudden courage, he sprang to his feet and rushed out of the room."], [105, "HERMENGARDE'S NEXT MOVE. 93 As he approached the entrance to the gallery a fresh idea struck him. His solitary interference might not be sufficient to avert the danger which threatened the King, Avhile it Avould certainly expose him to the vengeance of Johann and his fellow-conspirators. He made up his mind as he ran along to go round to the apartments of the King's aunt, and inform her of the situation, leaving it to her to summon assistance for her nepheAV. It did not take long for him to burst, all pale and trembling, into the presence of the Princess. She Avas not alone. With her was the Count von Sigismark, Avho had come to tender her his thanks for her graciousness in inviting his daughter to ride Avith Prince Ernest \u2014 perhaps also to try and ascertain Avhat meaning lay under this proceeding on the part of a Avoman Avho seldom acted without a motive. As soon as Karl could command his breath he panted out \u2014 \" Quick ! There is a man concealed in the south gallery, Avho has come here to murder the King. His name is Johann Mark, and he is a member of a secret society.\" For an instant Hermengarde gave Avay to sheer affright. Then, in a flash, she recovered herself, and darted a strange and aAvful look towards the Chancellor. But he either did not see or did not comprehend the look. As soon as the sense of Karl's announcement had reached his brain, he sprang up and rushed out through the open door, uttering loud cries for help. In a few seconds the whole Castle was roused, and an"], [106, "A CROW OF S .AW. 94 effective force was coming to the King's rescue in the manner already described. When Hermengarde left the gallery after Avitnessing the strange termination of the events Avhich had taken place there, she made an almost imperceptible signal to the Chancellor to follow her to her own apartments. The old courtier felt uneasy at the idea of having to discuss Avhat had just transpired Avith his formidable patroness. He Avould have preferred to have had time for consideration. But he did not dare to neglect her commands, and they were speedily closeted together. \" Well, Avhat do you think of this ? \" demanded the Princess as soon as they were alone. \" I can hardly answer you, Madam. I confess that at present I do not understand Avhat has occurred. I am in the dark.\" Hermengarde smiled at this excessive caution. \"As I have had the honour to remark to you once before to-day,\" she said, \"kings of Franconia sometimes do strange things. But I do not think I have ever heard of their doing a more extraordinary one than publicly pardoning an assassin, and at the same time inviting him to become their guest.\" The Chancellor fidgeted nervously. \"It certainly appeared as if he had come here Avith the intention of committing some crime. But perhaps his Majesty had succeeded in convincing him of his Avickedness before Ave arrived on the scene.\" \"Or perhaps he had succeeded in convincing his Majesty,\" sneered the Princess. \" It appears to me that our arrival Avas most inopportune. We were clearly"], [107, "HERMENGARDE'S NEXT MOVE. 95 not wanted, my dear Chancellor. By what right do we take it on ourselves to interrupt the King when he is conversing with his friends ? \" The old Count knitted his brows, but preserved a dis creet silence. He pricked up his ears at Hermengarde's next question. \"Can you tell me Avhether the revolutionary societies are very active in Mannhausen just now? \" \"I believe they are, Madam. I have received infor mation lately that a great many secret meetings are being held, and the police anticipate some formidable outbreak, unless AA'e are beforehand Avith them by arresting the ringleaders.\" \"Exactly. And do you think the effect will be dis couraging, or the reverse, Avhen they learn that one of their ringleaders has been publicly received in the palace, and enjoys the favour of the King ? Why, the Avhole country will ring Avith it. People will say that his Majesty is in sympathy Avith these Avretches.\" \" I hope it is not so bad as that. Surely the King's action Avas simply a piece of generosity \u2014 rather high floAvn, perhaps, but Avithout the least political significance. At least, as long as his Majesty entrusts me with the burden of gOA'ernment, you may rest assured that I shall not be a party to any yielding to sedition.\" \"Yes, as long as you are entrusted Avith it, Count. But, unless you look out, you may find that the King is listening to other advisers behind your back. The scene which has just taken place was hardly calculated to raise your authority in the eyes of the Court.\" And leaving this poisoned shaft to do its work in"], [108, "96 A CROWN OF STRAW. the sIoav mind ofthe Chancellor, Hermengarde dismissed him graciously, and summoned her favourite page. \"Go and find Karl Fink,\" she commanded. \"Say that you have a private message for him, and Avhen you are sure that you cannot be overheard, tell him from me to be at the Avest corner of the Castle terrace in ten minutes' time. Tell him to Avrap himself up.\" The message from the Princess found Karl in his own room, Avhither he had just retired after Johann was comfortably lodged in accordance Avith the King's direc tions. To his relief his former comrade had said but little when they were again together. \"You see, Karl,\" he observed sarcastically, \"your fears Avere groundless. Everything has passed off Avell, and you will not lose your head, after all.\" \"Swear that you will never let the King know Avho it Avas that brought you into the gallery,\" urged the other, still filled Avith apprehension. Johann regarded him pityingly. \" Poor fool ! If you have forgotten the oaths by Avhich Ave bound ourselves at Stuttgart, I have not. Fear nothing ; you are safe this time. But beware hoAV you hatch any further treachery. Next time you may not escape so lightly.\" Karl Avould have been only too glad to folloAV this advice. Nevertheless, Avhen the page came to summon him to attend on his mistress, he did not dare to send back a refusal. Hermengarde meanwhile had proceeded to divest herself of her jeAvels and of her outer skirt, and to put on a homely Avalking dress such as might have been"], [109, "HERMENGARDE'S NEXT MOVE. 97 Avorn by a woman of the middle class. This done she emerged cautiously from her apartment, and stole doAvn by a back staircase to the rendezvous. It was getting dark, and the night threatened to be a stormy one. She noted the signs of rough Aveather, and Avas about to re-enter the Castle to obtain a cloak, Avhen she saw the figure of a man coming towards her. It was Karl. With the Avarning of his former comrade still ringing in his ears, he came along reluctantly, feeling only too sure that his assistance was required for some purpose Avhich Avould not bear the light. As soon as he Avas near enough to recognize the Princess's countenance, he said \u2014 \" I hope your Royal Highness does not Avant me for long, as I may be summoned at any moment by his Majesty.\" Hermengarde frowned impatiently. She readily divined the Aveak and timorous character of her instru ment. \"It is on his Majesty's service that I require you,\" she ansAvered firmly. \" You are to accompany me to the lodge Avhere this Dorothea Gitten dAvells.\" Karl's lingering dread of Johann Avas still greater than his aAve of the Princess. \" Does his Majesty knoAv that Ave are going there ? \" he ventured to ask. Then Hermengarde began to see that something Avas the matter. By an effort she suppressed her pride for the moment, and condescended to make a half-confidant of the servant. \" I thought you understood by this time, Karl,\" she 11"], [110, "98 A CROWN OF STRAW. said, \" the object of the interest I take in this matter. Do you suppose that if I regarded it as a mere common love adventure I should take the trouble to go and see this girl ? It is because I have fears as to what it may lead to, OAving to my knoAvledge of your master's character. You are familiar Avith the fate of King Leopold, and you must see hoAV necessary it is that his friends should Avatch carefully over King Maximilian, Avhose eccentricities have already created a Avide feeling of apprehension.\" As her meaning slowly penetrated the man's mind, he fairly staggered. \"God in Heaven!\" he exclaimed. \"Surely your Royal Highness does not believe that the King is going mad!\" \" I have said nothing of the kind,\" returned the Princess quickly, seeing that she had gone too far. \" You have better opportunities of seeing than most of his attendants. HaA'e you noticed anything strange in his Majesty's conduct of late?\" \"Heaven forbid, your Royal Highness ! Hermengarde shrugged her shoulders. Karl drew back a step. \" Forgive me, Madam, but I dare not come with you,\" he said timidly. \"Silence, felloAV ! \" answered the Princess, speaking in low but menacing tones. \" Do you wish the King to knoAv that you have been playing the spy all these months, and carrying reports of all his movements to me ? Do you suppose that I could not crush you like an egg-shell if it Avere Avorth my Avhile? You have"], [111, "HERMENGARDE'S NEXT MOVE. 99 gone too far to disobey me now. Lead on to the cottage.\" The unfortunate Avretch submitted Avithout another word, and they started off through the forest, Karl going in front and the Princess keeping up close behind. For the next half-hour not a Avord Avas spoken. Then they gradually emerged from the thick growth of Avood and found themselves on the edge of the little clearing. \"Stay here,\" commanded the Princess, \"and wait for my return.\" Only too glad to escape further risk, Karl bowed, and slunk back behind the shadow of a large ash, Avhile the Princess advanced alone to the door of the forester's hut. It Avas by this time dark, and the glow of a lamp shone out through the Avindow of a room to the right of the Gothic porch. As Hermengarde knocked at the door this light Avas seen to move and pass out into the hall. Then came the noise of turning the lock, and the door opened, and Dorothea stood before her, holding the lamp high above her head. Hardened as she Avas, the Princess could not restrain a start of admiration Avhich testified that she noAV understood the King's infatuation. She quickly recovered herself, and addressed the young girl. \" I come from the Castle yonder,\" she said, \" and have missed my path in the Avood. I thought you Avould let me rest here for a little before I returned.\" \" Oh yes ; come in, if you please,\" Avas Dorothea's answer, in soft, musical tones, that yet had a faint under tone of pathos in them Avhich had been missing earlier in the day."], [112, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 100 The Princess folloAved her into the Ioaa', oak-roofed parlour Avhere she had been sitting, and accepted the wooden armchair, with a loose red cushion, which she pushed forward. Franz was not there. Dorothea ex plained that her father had gone out to make his round of the forest, and look out for poachers. \" And does he leave you here all alone ? \" queried Hermengarde, assuming an air of sympathy in order to set the girl at her ease. \" Oh yes, Madam. I am not afraid. I have been accustomed to stay here alone since my mother died. But Avon't you have some refreshment Avhile you are resting ? We have a hare in the larder, and some Avhite bread, which I make myself.\" \" Not anything to eat, thank you, my dear,\" responded Hermengarde, graciously. \" But I have heard that you make some most delicious cider ; can you spare me a glass of that?\" Dorothea flushed at the compliment. \" I shall be very pleased if you will taste it,\" she said ; \" but I am afraid you will be disappointed.\" She stepped to a cupboard in the Avail beside the fireplace, and dreAV forth the silver flagon. She had taken in her hand the famous glass out of Avhich Maximilian Avas accustomed to drink ; but after a moment's hesitation she put it back again, and chose the one with the slight flaw in its rim. \" This is a very old glass ; I hope you Avill not mind its being chipped,\" she said, as she filled it Avith the bright liquid, and offered it to the Princess. \" You need not make any excuses,\" the Princess"], [113, "HERMENGARDE'S NEXT MOVE. 101 answered. \" A glass Avhich is good enough for a King to drink out of is surely good enough for me.\" Dorothea gave a great start, and turned a pained, questioning look on the speaker, Avho only smiled in return. \" Why do you say that, Madam ? Who has told you about the King ? \" asked the agitated girl. The Princess put on a look of amused surprise. \" My dear child, surely you did not suppose it was such a secret ? The King of Franconia cannot come day after day to the same place without some people hearing of it. I ought to congratulate you. His Majesty is said to be very much charmed with \u2014 your cider.\" The meaning smile which accompanied these last words went like a stab through the shrinking girl. \" Please do not talk like that,\" she implored. \" I assure you, Madam, that up to an hour ago I never even dreamt that he was the King. His Majesty called himself simply Maurice when he Avas here, and I looked upon him as merely a young gentleman of the Court. And indeed he never did or said anything to make me think of him as anything more than a friend. And it Avas all so innocent and pleasant up till to-day. And then Johann saw him, and told me who he was, and hinted at such terrible things that he made me weep.\" At this name of Johann a look of vivid intelligence flashed from Hermengarde's eyes. It Avas scarcely an hour since she had heard that name under circumstances Avhich made it difficult for her to have forgotten it."], [114, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 102 \"Johann!\" she exclaimed. \"Is he a tall man, Avith dark hair and a pointed beard ? \" \" Yes ! Do you knoAv him ? \" Hermengarde, taken aback for the moment, hardly knew what ansAver to make. \" He is noAV in the Castle,\" she said at length. \" The King has taken him into favour, and they appear to be very friendly.\" Dorothea Avas utterly beAvildered. Only tAvo hours ago her cousin had left her, breathing hatred against the false Maurice. Now she learned that all his Avrath had apparently disappeared, and been replaced by quite opposite feelings. It Avas more than she could understand. Meamvhile Hermengarde sat busily revolving in her mind the neAv light thrown upon the King's extraordinary action in pardoning his Avould-be assassin. \" Is Johann a friend of yours ? \" she demanded pre sently, looking up. \" He is my cousin,\" answered Dorothea, Avith sim plicity ; \"he is my greatest friend in the Avorld.\" The Princess sat silent for a time, sipping her cider and Avatching Dorothea. At length she seemed to have made up her mind Avhat course to pursue, and putting down her glass, asked quietly \u2014 \"How should you like to come and stay at the Castle for a time, and see your cousin ? \" A troubled look came over the girl's face. \" I should not like it at all. I do not think I could bear it, to be there Avith all those lords and ladies. They Avould despise me, and I should be afraid of them.\""], [115, "HERMENGARDE'S NEXT MOVE. 103 \" I do not think you Avould find that they despised you if you came there as my guest,\" answered the Prin cess, gravely. Dorothea's eyes rounded once more. There seemed to be nothing but surprises in store for her to-day. \" Pardon me, Madam, but you have not \u2014 you did not tell me \" \" My name is Hermengarde. I am the King's aunt.\" And she lay back in her chair to see how the young girl would take the announcement. Dorothea's first feeling was one of dismay. All these startling events coming one upon another had completely unsettled her mind. She felt herself being gradually swept out of her depth. The old peaceful life of child hood was over, and she was being called upon to go forth into the Avorld under circumstances of trial and danger of which she had never had any conception. She directed an earnest, imploring gaze at the Prin cess, as if asking Avhether she could throAv herself upon her for sincere and friendly counsel. Then she said \u2014 \" I hardly knoAv hoAV to speak to your Royal Highness. I am afraid that you must think me very presumptuous. I hope you believe that I never knew it was his Majesty.\" Hermengarde looked at her graciously, not ill pleased at the evident awe she had excited. \" I do not think you are presumptuous in the least, my dear. On the contrary, if I found any fault with you, it would be that you are too shy, and have not enough confidence in yourself.

And in the same way, you need only say ' Sire ' to the King. It is only by servants, or on occasions of ceremony, that the formal titles are used.

I blame my nepheAv for deceiving you, because, though I am sure he had no ill intentions, he ought to have foreseen that the matter Avould be regarded in an unfavourable light by people generally, and that he Avas exposing you to unjust remarks.\" Poor Dorothea ! The recollection of Johann's words gave point to the observations of the Princess. She turned to her with looks of misery. \" Oh, Madam ! And do people think \u2014 are they saying \u2014 such horrible things ? What shall I do ? \" \" It is precisely on this account that I have come here,\" answered Hermengarde, assuming a comforting tone. \" I desire to protect you from evil tongues, by taking you into my own household. No man, AvhoeA'er he may be, is a fitting adviser for a girl, like one of her OAvn sex. So long as you stay in this cottage you are at the mercy of Maximilian's good feelings, to Avhich you ought not to blindly trust. Come and make your home Avith me, and the King will be compelled to adopt an honourable course towards you. What that will be, it is not for me"], [117, "HERMENGARDE'S NEXT MOVE. 105 to say. And the mere fact that I have given you my friendship Avill instantly silence any malicious slanders that may be abroad.\" Dorothea attempted to express her gratitude, but the stress of her emotions overcame her all at once, and before Hermengarde knew Avhat she Avas doing, the forester's child had flung herself doAvn at the feet of the Princess, and boAved her golden head in the proud, stern minded Avoman's lap. For a moment a soft look came into Hermengarde's eyes, such as they had not known for many a year, and she murmured gently \u2014 \" Poor girl, poor girl ! \" In another instant her face had resumed its usual calm expression. She stooped and raised Dorothea from the ground, getting up herself at the same time. \" There, my child, be still. You have a friend in me, Avhatever happens. And my friendship is not given to everybody. Now I will leave you to think over my offer ; only let me give you one caution, do not discuss the matter with anybody else. It is a thing which you must decide for yourself, without help. If you make up your mind to come to me, do not wait, but present your self at the Castle at any time, and I shall be ready and pleased to Avelcome you. Till then, good-bye.\" The agitated young girl could only stammer fresh words of thanks as she took up the lamp and ushered her visitor to the door. She Avas going to Avalk further Avith her, to point out the Avay, but the Princess stopped her. \"Do not come out, child. I can find my way back from here. Good night.\""], [118, "106 A CROWN OF STRAW. And without Avaiting for the farewells of the grateful Dorothea, she hastened forward to the spot where she had left her guide. As soon as the Castle Avas in sight Hermengarde turned to the favourite and handed him a generous bribe. \"I shall not forget you, Karl,\" she said. \"And remember that silence and discretion will double the value of your services.\" Karl accepted the money greedily enough, and stole away to his own quarters, while the Princess returned to her apartments absorbed in thought."], [119, "107 CHAPTER VIII. AN ANARCHIST KING. The next morning, after breakfast, Maximilian and Auguste Bernal Avere together in the small room Avhich constituted the royal cabinet. It Avas furnished plainly, Avith little of that \u00e6sthetic display Avhich shoAved itself in the King's other apartments, and the Avails Avere lined Avith volumes of a heavy and forbidding appearance ; the presence of Avhich, Maximilian Avas accustomed to say, exercised a sobering influence upon his mind, and disposed him to deal Avith serious business. On this occasion he seemed to be suffering under the reaction from last night's exciting ordeal. Even Auguste, used as he was to all his companion's varied moods, hardly kneAV how to reply to him. \" Let us look the situation in the face,\" Maximilian Avas saying, with perfect outAvard seriousness. \" How am I to carry out my promise ? Shall I send for Von Sigismark, and order him to proclaim the Millennium ? \" \"If you do that I am afraid the Chancellor will hand in his resignation,\" was the answer,"], [120, "108 A CROWN OF STRAW. \" Really ? I never thought of that. Then I could appoint Mark at once, and leave him to his OAvn devices.\" \"And all the other ministers and officials Avould resign too, and there would be no one to carry on the govern ment. No, seriously, my dear Max, Avhatever you do you must go to work gradually, and, above all, you must not give the Kaiser an excuse to interfere. I should strongly advise you to try and win over the Chancellor. He may be an old fool, but he is faithful, and his name commands confidence. It will be much better to work through him for a time.\" Maximilian shrugged his shoulders impatiently. \" I dare say you are right. I suppose I must feel my Avay at first. But I very much doubt Avhether we shall get Von Sigismark at his age to take kindly to any new departure.\" \" Well, you can but try. We do not yet know what this Mark, or whatever his name is, proposes to do. Why not have him in here first, and talk things over Avith him ? \" \" A good idea. Yes, that is the first step.\" The King got up, and Avalked past his friend to the bell-knob, which he pushed. \"Ask Herr Mark if he will kindly step this Avay,\" he said to the page in attendance. \"Mind,\" he added sharply, as the lad Avas turning to go, \" convey my message in those exact Avords.\" \" Yes, your Majesty.\" And the page withdrew, look ing rather surprised. \" I don't Avant him to go and say, ' The King commands"], [121, "AN ANARCHIST KING. 109 your attendance,'\" explained Maximilian, \"or very likely a man like that Avould refuse to come.\" \" It is lucky I am not so thin-skinned,\" said Bernal, laughing. \" They ahvays say that to me.\" \" Do they ? I will put a stop to it,\" flashed Max imilian. \" No, no. The less such people understand our friend ship, the SAveeter it is to me.\" And the musician patted the King affectionately on the arm as he returned past him to his seat. Maximilian gave his friend a look soft as a woman's. Before they had time to say anything more Johann Avas announced. The republican had passed an anxious time since the memorable scene in the gallery. The circumstances in Avhich he found himself Avere enough to beAvilder his judgment. A life-long plotter against kings, he Avas now installed in a royal palace, under the protection of a king. What Avould his comrades in the capital think of this strange ending to his mission ? Would they not condemn him as one Avho had broken his sacred oaths, under the influence of royal blandishments ? The thought was a disquieting one, but, on the other hand, he could console himself by the thought of the triumph Avhich would be his if he succeeded in really accomplish ing some of the great ideals of the Socialists by means of his royal disciple. To have enlisted a king on the side of the revolution \u2014 Avas not this a unique achieve ment ; one Avhich might lead to consequences of untold magnitude ? It might be possible in the course of a comparatively short time, and by perfectly peaceful"], [122, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 110 stages, to transform Franconia into that model land Avhich has been the dream of each generation of enthusiasts, though each generation may cherish different ideas of Avhat the model land should be like. And if Franconia led the Avay successfully, Avho could doubt that the rest of Europe Avould quickly follow ? Johann Avas like most of his fellows in assuming that men Avere reasoning beings. Once prove to them clearly what their true interests were, and he believed they would surely act on the knoAvledge. Of the poAver of the passions on human conduct he made no account. That the vast bulk of mankind cared far more for gratifying the craving or antipathy of the moment than for their rational Avelfare, he Avas sublimely unconscious. Of such stuff are apostles made. He entered the King's presence feeling slightly uneasy as to his reception under their neAv relations, and troubled also by his anxiety to avoid playing the courtier, Avhile conciliating the goodAvill of his convert. Maximilian greeted him cordially, but Avithout rising, and invited him to a seat betAveen the musician and himself. \" This is my friend, Herr Bernal,\" he said, as Johann stiffly took the seat offered to him. \" He is not a politician, as I dare say you know, but Ave can reckon on his goodwill.\" Johann boAved constrainedly. \" I have often heard your name, sir, and I have heard one or two of your operas, though music is not much in my line.\" Bernal could not resist a satirical smile at his friend."], [123, "AN ANARCHIST KING. 111 \"That is your misfortune, Herr Mark. Have you ever read the English poet Shakespeare ? \" \" I have read him in the translation.\" \"Ah, but the poetry is much better in the original.\" And glancing at Maximilian, he quoted in English \u2014 \"The man that hath no music in himself, Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds, Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils ; Let no such man be trusted.\" The King could not restrain a smile ; but he saAv that the republican Avas annoyed, and hastened to change the subject. \" I want to lose no time, as you see, in acting on my promise. You convinced me yesterday that I Avas a bad king ; now I want you to tell me how to become a better one.\" Johann had been rubbed the wrong way by Bernal's ill-disguised sarcasm. He replied ungraciously \u2014 \"If you are in earnest, sir, and really wish me to explain my ideas, I shall be very glad to do so. But you must alloAv me to speak to you quite plainly.\" \" That is exactly Avhat I Avish. I intend to send for the Count von Sigismark presently, to take him into consultation ; but, before he comes, I thought it would be better for us to have a little discussion, so that we may see our way more clearly.\" \" Certainly,\" said Johann, brightening up. \" No doubt you have some proposals Avhich could be taken in hand at once, if we can get the Chancellor to agree with them.\" \" Yes. There are many things which could be done."], [124, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 112 The only difficulty is to decide Avhere to begin. The ideal at which we aim, as I dare say you know, is the abolition of all government, except for purposes of organization, and the transformation of society into a vast co-operative machine for the production and equal distribution of Avealth amongst all its members. We aim at doing away Avith artificial mediums of exchange, such as money, and thus preventing the accumulation of Avealth in the hands of a few individuals ; Ave mean to replace the present costly system of litigation by a simple and speedy method of arbitration ; and to render military armaments unnecessary, by establishing a court for the settlement of international disputes, pending the consolidation of all nations into one united family. Those are a few of our main principles.\" \" You Avill have to leave the armament question alone for the present, or there will be the Kaiser to be reckoned Avith,\" remarked Bernal, drily. \" I expect the Kaiser himself will be coming here before long,\" observed Maximilian, \"and then I will get him to give you an interview, and you can try and convert him.\" \" Only take my advice,\" added the musician, \" and don't try to convert him Avith a pistol, because he is a rather good missionary in that line himself.\" Johann frowned, and the King cast a reproving look at his friend. \" Now, Auguste, Ave shall have enough opposition as it is, Avithout your discouragement.\" And he turned once more to Johann. \" Of course, to me, all these things you describe seem"], [125, "AN ANARCHIST KING. 113 a long Avay off. Whether we shall ever get to them I cannot pretend to say. But, in the mean time, it must be possible to take some steps in the right direction. You spoke yesterday of various things, some of which seemed to be feasible enough. Hospitals, for instance, and public Avorks.\" The socialist's face fell. It Avas a great descent to these petty reforms from the high ideals Avhich he had just been sketching out. \" True, your Majesty.\" The title fell from him un consciously, and only Bernal noticed that it had been used. \" Of course, a great deal of good might be done in that Avay at once. But surely it is hardly Avorth Avhile to Avaste time over that, when you might be begin ning the greater Avork. Why not commence Avith some bold step which Avould rally round you all the friends of progress, and convince the Avorld that you were in earnest ? \" \" What kind of step do you mean ? \" Johann hesitated. Those among whom he moved Avere more accustomed to dealing in general pro grammes than to considering the practical method of carrying them out. \"Suppose you commenced by nationalizing the land and the means of production,\" he suggested, after a minute's consideration. \"That Avould be a great step gained. Then Ave could proceed to re-arrange the conditions of labour, by shortening the hours of toil, and equalizing the wages for mental and manual work.\" Maximilian Avas a little puzzled. \" I am afraid I hardly knoAv enough about these 1"], [126, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 114 things to discuss them with you. I think perhaps we had better send for the Chancellor at once, and you can explain your proposals to him.\" Bernal got up and rang the bell Avithout Avaiting for more. Imvardly he was impatient to see the Socialist and the Prime Minister confronting each other. \" Tell the Count von Sigismark that I desire his attendance,\" said the King, as soon as his page appeared. While they Avere Avaiting for the Count, he returned to Avhat he had been saying. \"You have no doubt thought out these vast changes until they appear easy and natural to you ; but I have given such little attention to political affairs, that I feel quite in the dark as to hoAv Ave ought to proceed. The Chancellor understands the practical side of govern ment, and you and he may be able to Avork out some definite scheme.\" \" Of course you may find the Count a little prejudiced at first,\" threAv in Bernal. \" You must remember that he is elderly, and his training may have narroAved his mind.\" Johann looked at him, uncertain Avhether to reply angrily, or to pass over his Avords as unworthy of notice. Before he could come to a decision Von Sigismark entered the cabinet. \"Good morning, Count,\" said the King, in his most friendly manner. \"Be good enough to sit down. I Avant your assistance.\" The Chancellor greeted the King respectfully, and obeyed, casting a severe look at the republican, and a not very friendly one at Bernal."], [127, "AN ANARCHIST KING. 115 Maximilian at once broached the subject. \"They tell me I govern my kingdom badly,\" he said ; \" I have made up my mind to reform. The Herr Mark, whom you see here, has devoted himself to these subjects, and he has been good enough to promise me his assistance. I want you to hear some of his ideas, in order that you may consider the best way of carrying them out.\" The Chancellor froAvned sullenly as he answered \u2014 \" I am ready to hear anything which your Majesty orders me to listen to.\" This did not sound promising, and the King bit his lip as he turned to Johann. \"Tell the Count von Sigismark what you propose,\" he said briefly. The republican fidgeted uneasily before he began, and made fruitless attempts to catch the eye of the Minister, which travelled alternately betAveen his master's countenance and the ceiling of the room. \" I have been explaining to the King some of the ideas which are held by men of enlightened vieAvs \u2014 that is to say, by friends of progress \u2014 Avith regard to the reformation of society.\" Thus far he had tried to address the Chancellor direct, but he now gave it up as a bad job, and turned towards Maximilian, who en couraged him by a nod to go on. \" His Majesty wished me to begin by suggesting a simple practical step which Avould be easy to carry out, before realizing Avhat may be called our main object, namely, the collective pro duction and distribution of wealth.\" He paused. The Chancellor's features were set in"], [128, "116 A CROWN OF STRAW. stony impassiveness. To all appearance he was uncon scious that anything Avas being said. \"That is right. Go on, Herr Mark,\" threAv in the King, hopefully. \"The reform that occurred to me was the nationaliza tion of the land and its adjuncts. We propose to take all the soil of the country, together with the buildings, railways, mines, machinery, and other means of wealth production, into the hands of the government. We should then be able to alter the conditions of labour, and after securing to all the Avorkers a fair remuneration according to the value of their work, and equalizing and reducing the hours of toil, the surplus Avould pass into the coffers of the State, and Ave could use it in public Avorks, and in bestowing pensions on the aged and infirm. Of course, this would only be the pre liminary stage. We hope ultimately to dispense entirely Avith money as an exchange medium, and replace it by State coupons representing so much labour. But before doing that Ave shall have to absorb the Avhole machinery of distribution, so that the State AviU be the sole pos sessor of Avealth.\" Carried away by his theme, the Socialist had gone on further than he intended. Pulling himself up Avith difficulty, he glanced once more at the forbidding face of the Count von Sigismark, only to see its former impassiveness replaced by an expression of mingled horror and contempt. \"Well,\" said Maximilian to the Minister, \"you have heard Herr Mark's programme. What do you say to it?\""], [129, "AN ANARCHIST KING. 117 Von Sigismark AvithdreAV his eyes from the ceiling. \"Do I understand that your Majesty really entertains these monstrous proposals seriously ? \" \" Certainly I do. And I shall be obliged if you will express your opinion of them in milder language.\" \" I beg your Majesty's pardon. I am an old servant of the Crown \u2014 I have served your Majesty faithfully for ten years, and his Majesty the late king for twenty five years before that \u2014 and I have never before been asked to listen to such suggestions as I have just heard. I implore your Majesty to dismiss these pernicious ideas at once. I can remember the time Avhen the papers Avhich published such things Avould have been sup pressed, and the men Avho preached them imprisoned. I am getting an old man, and I take the liberty of speaking plainly. This gentleman is proposing a re volution, nothing more nor less.\" Maximilian grew a little pale, and sat more upright in his chair. \" I regret, Count, that you should think it your duty to address such remonstrances to me, though I give you credit for your loyal intentions. But you have heard what I said. Herr Mark has made a definite suggestion, Avhat he calls nationalizing the land. I do not at present understand the best means to put that suggestion into effect. I have sent for you to ask you if you do. Be good enough to answer me.\" The Count's expression changed from anger to alarm, and from alarm back to indignation, as he listened to the King's words. He replied in subdued tones \u2014 \" It is difficult for me to answer your Majesty in any"], [130, "118 A CROWN OF STRAW. different way. This is a proposal, as I understand it, to confiscate the greater part of the Avealth of the country. In the first place, the legislature would never even look at such a measure. In the second, its passing, its mere introduction even, would be the signal for a revolution. The Avhole of the propertied classes, the nobility, the army, the toAvnspeople, all but the lowest of the populace, Avould be up in arms. Your Majesty's Government could not last another day. Your throne Avould not be safe. I tremble to think Avhat might happen. I dare not even hint at the possible conse quences to your Majesty.\" The King grew paler yet. \" In other words, you refuse to assist me ? \" \" Your Majesty, as I have already said, I am getting an old man, and I have served the CroAvn of Franconia for thirty-five years. I begin to fear that I can do so no longer. I must humbly beg your Majesty to permit me to send in my resignation.\" So saying, he rose to his feet. The King seemed about to burst out in violence ; but, catching a Avarning glance from Bernal, he restrained himself by an effort, and answered in mild tones \u2014 \"No, Von Sigismark, we must not part like this. No doubt you have been taken by surprise, possibly I ought to have prepared you more gradually. At present you have not had time to consider things calmly. Do not speak any more of resignation, but retire noAV, and let us reneAV our conversation on these proposals at some future time.\" \"As your Majesty pleases,\" murmured the old"], [131, "AN ANARCHIST KING. 119 man. And he Avalked out of the room Avith a troubled look. The troubled look did not leave his face as he hastened Avith uneven steps doAvn the royal corridor, and out into the gallery Avhere the strange scene of the day before had taken place. In the gallery he en countered the Count von Stahlen with his inseparable companion. The Chancellor gave them a sharp nod and was going past, but the wit stopped in front of him. \" Ha ! Good morning, Chancellor ! \" he exclaimed. \" I hope nothing has occurred to put you out They say the King has turned Anarchist.\" Von Sigismark darted an angry frown at the jester, and hurried aAvay, his ears tingling Avith the mocking laughter of the faithful Von Hardenburg. Maximilian sat in silence after the Chancellor's de parture, staring moodily before him, while Johann anxiously Avatched his face. Bernal was the first to speak. \" You will have to get the old Count alone and talk with him, if you Avant to get him to assist you.\" Maximilian rose from his seat and approached Johann. \"You see, Herr Mark, the position I am in. After what has passed this morning you will be able to understand hoAV little power is really enjoyed by the most absolute monarchs. In my Avhole kingdom I do not know of one man whom I can rely on to carry out my wishes. Realize the truth : society, as we see it, is merely an equilibrium of forces ; it can only be disturbed"], [132, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 120 by force, and it is as difficult and as dangerous for a King to commence a revolution as for any private man.\" He moved to the window of the room, overlooking a corner of the royal park, and stood gazing out. Johann rose to his feet, looking much disturbed. \" I can appreciate the difficulties of your position, sir,\" he observed respectfully, \"and I quite see that it is hopeless to attempt to do anything Avith the Count von Sigismark. But Avhy should we be in his hands ? Surely it is possible to find some other Minister more in sympathy with progressive ideas? You are the King of Franconia, and if these people find out that you mean to go forward there will soon be plenty of them to rally round you. Do not be discouraged because one old man is jealous at seeing his authority Aveakened.\" The King listened, but shook his head, and replied Avithout turning round \u2014 \" It is because I feel that Von Sigismark is a type of all the others that I am discouraged. Depend upon it they AviU all have the same tale. And how can I fight against them ? As you heard me say just now, I am ignorant of these things ; I have never paid any attention to State affairs. My people do not know me, they never see or hear of me ; I am a stranger in my own capital. What chance have I against my Ministers, who have the whole affairs of the kingdom in their hands ? The only men who Avield power in Europe to-day are the specialists, and I am not a specialist in government.\" \" Then become one, sir. Assert your rightful place in the Government, compel these men to lay the"], [133, "AN ANARCHIST KING. 121 business of their departments before you ; begin gradu ally by making little changes here and there, and Avhen you have an opportunity, dismiss one of them as a Avarning to the rest. Start a feAV of those minor reforms of which Ave Avere speaking before, and become popular Avith the nation. Take up your residence in Mannhausen, and go about among the people and acquire their con fidence. In a short time you will be stronger than any of your Ministers, and you will be in a position to dispense with their services altogether if they refuse to carry out your policy. Oh, sir, think Avhat a sublime part you might play. Think of the grand task of inaugurating the greatest revolution, and the last, in the history of mankind ! What are all the achievements of all the monarchs Avho ever lived compared Avith this? The names of Napoleon and Charlemagne and C\u00e6sar would sink into insignificance beside yours. Even Mahomet, even Buddha, even Christ, did not achieve the emancipation of their species.\" He stopped abruptly, overcome by his emotion, and the King, bowing his head till his forehead rested on the AvindoAV-pane, made no reply. Presently the musician said quietly \u2014 \" It seems to me that I ought to leave off Avriting operas. This is a bolder conception than any I have ever dared to use.\" Johann gave him an irritated look. There was some thing in the other's easy nature Avhich jarred upon his OAvn rigid disposition. \" Well, my friend,\" said the King at length, looking round, \"I am not going to give up. I Avill try and"], [134, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 122 keep my promises to you yet. But I Avish, for your sake, that you had got a better ally. I am afraid I am the Avrong man for Avork like this. You are trying to pierce an armour plate with an ivory needle.\" He remained silent for a short time, and then added, in a more cheerful tone of voice \u2014 \u25a0 \"There is another subject about which I Avish to speak to you \u2014 your cousin Dorothea. You said you Avere at the cottage yesterday. Did you say anything to her about me? \" Johann hung his head. \" I saAv you leaving,\" he ansAvered, \" and, finding that she did not knoAv who you Avere, I told her. I am afraid I expressed myself rather harshly about you. I judged of course merely by appearances.\" Maximilian sighed, \" I do not in the least blame you. No doubt you took the natural view. What I am sorry for is that the old pleasant state of things has been destroyed, and I shall never be able to go there again on the former footing. But perhaps it is as Avell, it Avas bound to have come before long.\" \" The moment I see Dorothea, I shall take care to tell her that I misjudged your Majesty.\" \" Thank you, that is kind of you. Now that she knoAvs Avho I am, I hardly know hoAv she will feel to me. You will respect my confidence Avhen I tell you that, if I Avere satisfied that Dorothea loved me as I love her, I believe I should have sufficient courage to make her Queen of Franconia in spite of a thousand Von Sigismarks. But I dread inexpressibly the idea of"], [135, "AN ANARCHIST KING. 123 forcing her inclinations in any way. Will you act as my ambassador? Will you use your freedom as a relation to ascertain as Avell as you can what her feelings really are ? And try, if you can, to inspire her with confidence in me. Tell her that a King is not such a very dreadful personage after all.\" \" I will, sir ; I will go and see her at once, and I hope I shall bring you good news.\" He left the cabinet ; and as he did so Bernal got up and came across to the windoAv Avhere the King Avas standing. \"Well, Max, after this you will believe me when I say that I do not envy you the position of King of Franconia.\" Maximilian sighed, and turned his eyes once more out on to the park. \" What can I do ? Men are not like the characters in your operas. I cannot control their actions, and mould their characters to suit the parts I Avant them to play.\" \" And Avhy should you ? Do not take this man Mark too seriously. You and I have the character of idealists and dreamers, but we are sober matter-of-fact persons compared with him. I grant you his ideas are noble, but they are impossible. Trust me, after a few more interviews such as we have had to-day, he will begin to see the hopelessness of his wild schemes. I heard him call you ' your Majesty ' twice. Build him a hospital in Mannhausen, and set him up as director ; that will give him something to occupy his mind.\" \" Ah, but that would not relieve me. How can I"], [136, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 124 help feeling the truth there is in his Avords, in Avhat he said to me yesterday ? After all, he is right ; I am the King, and I cannot get rid of my responsibility. I wish I could. If I could help matters by abdicating, I think I should do it. But I am afraid poor Ernest would not be much of an improvement.\" \"Don't think of that. After all, they cannot say that you are a bad king. Let these revolutionists fight their own battle, if they have the courage of their convictions. You can always look on and see fair play, and if they get put into prison you can let them out again. Why should you be expected to take all the risk, and carry out the work single-handed ? Come, you must not let your mind dwell so much on this business. We have managed to get along together pretty Avell before this cropped up, and Avhy should you let your Avhole life be upset by this fellow's exhortations ? \" Maximilian laid his hand on his friend's shoulder. \" Do not think that I mean to let anything of this sort interfere Avith our friendship, Auguste. Nothing can come betAveen you and me \u2014 you knoAv me too Avell to think that. But I passed through an experience yesterday, and it has left its mark. When that man stood there, Avith his pistol covering me, and spoke to me as he did, I felt that I Avas listening to a voice Avhich I had been trying to shut out all my life, and which at last had pierced its Avay into my selfish isolation. It Avas the voice of humanity, the voice of duty. Auguste, he Avas right My people have a right to demand that I shall govern them like a king, or"], [137, "AN ANARCHIST KING. 125 give up my crown. What have I ever done for Franconia ? What return have I ever made to the millions who Avork and toil and serve me, and supply me Avith the sums I have lavished on my own pleasures ? This talk of revolution may be idle ; I fear it is. I may not be able to reorganize society, to divide the wealth of the few among the many, to change the conditions of labour, to alter the great channels in which human life has run for thousands upon thousands of years. But surely I could do something, Auguste ; something not quite umvorthy of my trust ; something that Avould better the lot of these millions ; something to lighten their burdens and to make their lives less like the brutes' ; something that would make them look up to me and bless me, and would make me feel that my life had not been a mere waste of existence, like a river running through the desert and losing itself miserably in the barren sands.\" Auguste Avas deeply moved. \" My friend, you are a better man than I am. You are Avorthier of your croAvn than you think.\" The words had hardly left his lips when he saw a sharp look of mingled pain and dread start on the King's face. He drew back hastily from the Avindow pane, and turned his eyes into the room. \" What is it ? \" questioned Auguste, peering out in the direction in Avhich his friend had been looking. He saw nothing, except the figure of a tall, spare man, clad in the grave costume of the nineteenth century. His long frock coat Avas buttoned closely round his figure, and he held his hands behind his back,"], [138, "126 A CROWN OF STRAW. and stooped slightly as he walked towards the palace with sIoav, deliberate steps. \" Who is that man ? Do you knoAv him ? \" And the King ansAvered beneath his breath \u2014 \" Yes ; it is the Court physician, Doctor Krauss.\""], [139, "127 CHAPTER IX. DOROTHEA'S CHOICE. Franz Gitten sat on a Avooden seat at the side of his cottage porch, and puffed discontentedly at the long pipe Avith the china boAvl. Through the open door of the lodge came an occasional sound of the rattling of crockery, and the clashing of knives and forks. It Avas the hour after the midday meal, and his daughter was busy in the kitchen. Franz smoked and listened, and over his face there deepened a look of resentment. It was the look of a man Avho feels that he has been hardly used. He had Avorn the same look all day, and Avhenever his eye had caught Dorothea's, he had thrown a reproachful ex pression into it, as of a father who had striven hard for his child's welfare, and had been rewarded by that child Avith ingratitude. Nothing had passed between the two on the subject Avhich was uppermost in both their minds. Since Johann's stunning revelation of the day before, a barrier had for the first time sprung up betAveen them. Doro thea's trustful confidence in her father had apparently"], [140, "128 A CROWN OF STRAW. gone for ever, but Avhether out of a lingering respect for him, or from a forlorn Avish not to have her sus picions of him turned into certainties, she had refrained from seeking any explanation of his conduct with regard to the King's visits. Franz, on his side, did not venture to broach the topic first. He perceived the shock Avhich had been given to Dorothea's mind, and he dared not risk making the breach Avider. But his Avatchful eyes noted that the King's gift had disappeared from its place, and he dreAV the augury that things were not going altogether favourably, and that his promotion to the post of ranger of the forest Avas further out of reach than it had seemed the day before. Not daring to quarrel openly Avith his daughter, he Avas endeavouring to Avear doAvn her obstinacy by an attitude of sulky aloofness. In the mean time his bitterest wrath Avas reserved for the person Avhom he looked upon as the author of all the trouble, his nephew Johann. It Avas while he Avas thus brooding sullenly over his grievances that he heard the click of the gate-latch, and looked round to see the enemy coming boldly toAvards him. Instantly he rose from his seat, and pulled-to the door of the cottage. \" Noav, sir, Avhat have you come here again for ? \" he demanded, as soon as his nephew came up. The other gave him a look, half contemptuous, half angry. \" I Avonder you dare to look me in the face,\" he said."], [141, "DOROTHEA'S CHOICE. 129 \" You, Avith your miserable cunning ; Avhat have you been expecting as the result of these secret visits of the King?\" \" That is not your business. What right had you to thrust your oar in, and terrify that silly girl with your blustering talk? \" \" It is my business, as long as Dorothea is my cousin. You had better speak plainly ; did you Avish to see your daughter ruined ? \" \"Don't talk like that to me. Do you suppose I don't knoAv AA'hat I am about ? If you had only left things alone a little longer, his Majesty might haA'e made her a countess \u2014 think of that !

You may thank your stars that Dorothea's simple innocence has done more for her than all your hateful scheming. If you will only leave Avell alone, if you Avould only go and bury yourself for the next six months, there Avould be a chance of her becoming something higher than a countess.\" The old forester drew back astonished. He hardly grasped the full import of his nepheAv's Avords, but he gathered enough to feel his hopes rapidly reviving within him. \" Hoav ? What do you mean ? Why do you say that ? \" he asked eagerly. \" I say it because I have had the honour of talking on the subject Avith King Maximilian himself.\" K"], [142, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 130 \" You ! With King Maximilian ! \" The forester's manner suddenly became deferential. \"Yes. Since yesterday I have been staying in the Castle as the King's guest. He has taken me into his confidence, and as it will be impossible to keep you in ignorance, I may as Avell tell you \u2014 but beware hoAv you repeat it \u2014 that it is possible that he may make Dorothea his Queen.\" Franz lifted his hands in utter beAvilderment \" God in heaven ! I alwrays thought he AA'as queer in the head ; but I never thought he Avas so mad as that ! \" Johann started. He heard the voice of public opinion, coming from the mouth of a knave. \" Remember,\" he said sternly, \" on your life you are not to say a Avord about this.\" \" My dear nephew,\" exclaimed the delighted Franz, \" you may trust me absolutely. But I suppose I may tell Dorothea. Let us go inside.\" And he laid his hand on the knob of the door, imvardly resolving to persuade Dorothea that this Avas Avhat he had foreseen all along. \" Stop ! \" cried Johann. \" That is the very thing you are not to do. The King Avishes her to be absolutely free, and he has sent me here to sound her feelings Avithout letting her know of his intentions.\" The forester's face fell. Forbidden to bring his parental authority to bear, he felt less confident of the issue. \" The King will be here later on,\" added Johann, \" and, if you take my advice, you will let him see as little of"], [143, "DOROTHEA'S CHOICE. 131 yourself as possible. You are not exactly a father-in-laAV for King Maximilian to be proud of.\" \" For all that he shall make me a count Avhen he marries Dorothea,\" muttered Franz, as his nephew brushed past him into the cottage. On consideration, however, he thought there Avas Avisdom in Johann's remark ; and instead of lying in wait as usual to AA'elcome the King Avhen he arrived, he threw a gun over his shoulder, and made off into another quarter of the forest. Johann Avalked straight into the kitchen, where he found his little cousin in the act of polishing a large metal dish-cover. Something seemed to have changed in her since yesterday, for, instead of running to embrace him, she stood still and received his kiss Avith a slight air of constraint. \" I have come to have a quiet talk Avith you,\" remarked Johann, dropping on to an old-fashioned settee Avhich ran along one of the Avails of the kitchen. \" You can leave that cover alone.\" But Dorothea seemed to have developed a vein of obstinacy since yesterday. \" I can do this, and listen to you at the same time,\" she retorted, rubbing aAvay vigorously. \" Ah, you wi 1 1 soon leave off that Avhen you hear my neAvs,\" remarked Johann, complacently. \" Where do you think I spent last night ? \" \" At the Castle.\" \" What ! Who told you ? Have you been listening ? \" \" I AA-as told so by the Princess Hermengarde. She said the King and you Avere great friends.\""], [144, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 132 Johann sprang half out of his seat with surprise. \"The Princess Hermengarde! Where did you see her ? \" \"She came here last night She Avas exceedingly kind. After all, there is no reason why you should be the only one to have friends at the Castle.\" The young man scarcely heeded this gentle sarcasm. HeAvas greatly perplexed by the news of Hermengarde's intervention. It Avas true he knew very little about the Princess ; but he felt sure that she was not the kind of Avoman to act from mere benevolence. He could only suppose that she had fathomed the King's ulterior design, and Avas proceeding to ingratiate herself Avith the future Queen of Franconia. Where the King goes, the courtiers will soon folloAv. \" Well, do not trust her too far,\" he said at length. \" Be civil to her, but do not have too much to say to her.\" \"Why do you say that?\" demanded Dorothea. \" Because I know more about her than you. You do not understand these p:op'c as I do.\" \" Oh ! \" Dorothea turned aAvay to the dish-cover Avith reneAved energy. The young man tried to attract her attention. \" Dorothea ! Listen. Yesterday I spoke to you rather harshly about King Maximilian. You told me he had been coming here day after day to see you, and I naturally put a bad construction on his conduct. Noav I find I Avas unjust. I have found out more than I can say at present, but enough to convince me that he is one of the noblest and sincerest of men.\""], [145, "DOROTHEA'S CHOICE. 133 \" I am glad to hear that, because I ahvays liked him.\" She said this quite calmly, and without ceasing from her occupation. \"Perhaps you will find out you have been unjust to the Princess as well.\" \" My dear girl ! What has come over you ? Do you doubt my Avord Avhen I tell you that I distrust the Princess ? I only Avarn you for your good.\" \"Thank you, Johann.\" And she gave him a boAV over the dish-cover. \" Now, there is a thing I Avant to ask you. The King has been coming here a good deal, and you have had plenty of opportunities to understand him. Have you guessed how he feels toAvards you ? \" Silence for a time. The polishing continued more earnestly than ever. Then, in a Ioav voice \u2014 \" I think I guessed yesterday.\" \" That he loved you ? \" Johann spoke triumphantly. \" Well, then, Avhat do you think of it ? Supposing he Avere not the King, should you be willing to accept him?\" Silence. That cover seemed to require a great deal of brightening. There must even have been spots on it, for Dorothea's face Avas bent so closely doAvn to it that Johann could not see hoAV she received his question. The clumsy ambassador thought he could take silence for consent. Stepping a little outside the bounds of his instructions in his confidence, he said \u2014 \"Well, perhaps before very long you may find that he will ask you to be his wife ! \" He spoke in the tone of one Avho expects to produce a sensation. But he Avas destined to be disappointed."], [146, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 134 Dorothea received his intimation Avith strange calmness, and did not even interrupt her labours for more than an instant. He felt driven to remonstrate Avith her. \"Come, you take it very coolly. Do you mean to say that you anticipated this ? \" \" I hardly know. But it makes no difference. I shall not marry the King.\" \"What! What do you say?\" His astonishment passed into rebuke. \" Be serious. Put doAvn that miserable thing, and consider Avhat you are saying. You do not seem to understand. He will make you Queen of Franconia.\" She left off her Avork for a moment, and looked him full in the face. \" I do not Avant to be Queen of Franconia. I am not fit for it I am only a peasant girl, and I should be miserable if I had to spend my life in a Court.\" \" Nonsense ! This is absurd. If I am not miserable there, Avhy should you be ? Is it because you are too young to understand Avhat you are refusing, or because you do not love the King after all ? \" The polishing still Avent on, but more fitfully, as if the arm of the polisher Avere getting tired. \" I did not think that you attached so much impor tance to rank, Johann. You used to be a Republican.\" He flushed angrily. \" So I am still. It is not the rank I think of, but the influence it will give you for good. Do you know that the King is already half-converted to my ideas ? He has asked me to stay with him and assist in reforming"], [147, "DOROTHEA'S CHOICE. 135 his Government And think Avhat it Avould be to have you, a daughter of the people, on the throne, always by the King's side to persuade him to the right course !

You do not dislike the King ? \" \" No, I do not dislike the King.\" \" Then Avhy should you hesitate ? Come, Dorothea, you and I have always been good friends ever since we were children, but I do not think I could forgive you, if you refused to help me in this. Think it over before the King comes, and at all events do not break off Avith him altogether. Promise me that ? \" The polishing had grown feebler. It ceased \"Very well. I will promise not to break off Avith him yet.\" And then Johann thought it prudent to get up and go out of reach ; and no sooner Avas he gone than Dorothea laid down the gleaming cover right in a pool of Avater, so that all the polishing AA'ould have to be done over again. After Avhich she Avent quietly out of the kitchen and upstairs to her OAvn room, to prepare for the visit of the King. On this afternoon Maximilian came by himself, only attended as far as the forest by his favourite Karl. He came along Avith beating heart, murmuring to himself the fragment of an old German song : \u2014"], [148, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 136 \" 111 for the man who loves a child ; Better to woo the wood-bird wild, Flying free in the middle air.\" Over and over again he reckoned up all the smiles he had ever received from Dorothea, and every look and Avord Avhich could betoken the secret groAvth of love. And as he thought, and as he counted, his heart grew great Avithin him, and his step greAv buoyant, and the old earth seemed to bend and SAving beneath him, and all the branches of the trees to Avave salutes, and every leaf and blade to toss for joy, as he strode onward to meet his bride. And ever and anon, from the very bottom of his heart there crept up a cold doubt like a mist, and blotted out all his tender pictures one by one ; and his spirit Avavered and went doAvn like the flame of a fire Avhen the rain falls on it ; and bitterly he reproached his fortune that had done so much for him, but yet could not do this one last thing \u2014 like the mighty roar ing Nasmyth hammer, that can crush a cannon-ball and stroke an eggshell, but yet cannot give a new curve to the stalk of the tiniest flower. So he came on, impatiently, and yet dreading to reach his journey's end. When he arrived at the forester's lodge, he found no one Avaiting to receive him. He passed through the gate and took his Avay to the arbour, where he sat doAvn alone. But Dorothea had watched for his coming, and when she saAv him she set the flagon and the unbroken glass on a tray, and brought them out to him."], [149, "DOROTHEA'S CHOICE. 137 He rose up at her entrance, and looked at her stead fastly, but he did not venture to embrace her as of old. She greeted him Avith a new deference, Avhich had taken the place of her former shy friendliness, and poured out the cider for him to drink, and waited. \" Sit down, my child,\" he said gravely, setting her the example. \" So they have told you Avho I am at last?\" \" Yes, Sire.\" She sat doAvn, but not on the same seat Avith him, nor did he seem to expect it \" No, Dorothea, you are not to call me that Let me still be the Herr Maurice Avhen I am here, at least.\" There folloAved a pause which it Avas difficult for either of them to break.

Forgive me, I am young and ignorant, and I am not Avorthy of your love.\" Then an infinite tenderness, Avhich was the greatest happiness he had ever knoAvn, filled Maximilian's soul, and he stooped and lifted her up, and clasped her to him once, and kissed her on the forehead and on the lips, and set her doAvn beside him."], [150, "138 A CROWN OF STRAW. \"My darling, I have loved you all this time, and never dared to tell you, for fear I might frighten you and lose your confidence.

Of course these societies are to be found in all the capitals of Europe, but for some reason they have lately been particularly active in Mannhausen. The actual number enrolled is about two thousand.\" \" Three thousand,\" threw in Maximilian. The Minister looked surprised and annoyed. \"Possibly your Majesty has better sources of informa tion than I have,\" he began. \" I have.\" The King's tone Avas severe. \" I beg your pardon, Sire.

And am I to take it, Count, that you endorse Herr Moritz's recommendations ? \" \"Most decidedly so, Sire. In my humble opinion nothing else can save us from a dangerous rebellion.\" \"Very good, Nqav listen.

Nevertheless, it Avas to the Princess she fled from the new complexities which beset her life at the forester's lodge. Though far from expecting her invitation to be so promptly accepted, Hermengarde had been careful to leave instructions that Dorothea should be admitted to her at any time Avhen she might present herself. When, therefore, the exhausted and trembling girl arrived at the Castle after her flight through the forest, she found no difficulties in the Avay of her entrance. The hour Avas half-past ten, Avhich Avas not quite so late in the palace as in the cottage, and Hermengarde, Avhen Dorothea Avas announced, Avas sitting alone Avith her son, Avhom she Avas trying to interest in a game of draughts.

And Dorothea entered. As she came in, Ernest turned round in natural curiosity to see Avhat she Avas like. The result seemed to be satisfactory, for he got up and offered her his hand, to the surprise of his mother. Dorothea, unused to the Avays of Courts, took the young Prince's hand unaffectedly in her own, and by that simple act confirmed the good impression. \" This is my son, Prince Ernest Leopold,\" obser\\red Hermengarde, Avith the slightest possible emphasis on the \" Prince.\" Dorothea shrank back a little and blushed. The Princess good-naturedly reassured her. \" But I hope you will be good friends. Sit down here by me, and tell me Avhy you have come. Ernest, you can say good night\" The boy obeyed, and withdrew Avith more reluctance than he generally showed at quitting his mother's presence. \" He is a little shy for his age,\" remarked the Princess, as the door closed behind him ; \" but no doubt he will groAV out of it before long. You Avould hardly take him for sixteen, Avould you ? \" Dorothea made some suitable reply, and began to"], [171, "HERMENGARDE DROPS A HINT. 159 seel more at ease under the influence of this homely talk. \"And noAV, my dear child, tell me Avhat is the matter ? \" said Hermengarde, patting the girl's hand affectionately. By Avay of answer Dorothea poured out the story of the day's events, the hints of a royal marriage dropped by Johann, the promise Avhich she had given to Maximilian to try and reciprocate his love, and, finally, the coarse attempt of her father to take the control of her conduct The Princess listened, Avatching her Avith steady eyes, and nodding occasionally to her self. At the close Dorothea's voice began to tremble, and she finished off with a broken appeal to her protectress. \"I have no one to tell me Avhat to do,\" she said. \" All this has come upon me so suddenly. Tavo days ago I Avas like a child, without a care in the Avorld, except Avhen one of the hens laid an egg Avhere I could not find it.

Among these Avas the Chancellor's daughter, Avhom Hermengarde apparently had no desire to keep in the dark. Dorothea, of course, had no knoAvledge of the former relations betAveen the Lady von Sigismark and Maximilian, but Gertrude was on the defensive from the first, against the girl Avhom she considered in the light of a rival. Matters Avere not improved in this quarter by the rather obvious preference Avhich Prince Ernest showed for the peasant girl ; and it taxed all his mother's resources to keep up the fiction of an intimacy between Gertrude and the Prince. So unlike his mother did the boy sIioav himself in everything, and so different from all that she sought to make him, that there were times Avhen, in her despair, she Avas ready to admit to herself that Von Stahlcn's designation of him as \" The Changeling \" was not altogether Avide of the mark."], [173, "HERMENGARDE DROPS A HINT. 161 Although Dorothea's installation in her household had been so quietly managed, the Princess did not, of course, expect it to remain a secret for many hours.

Half-naked boys, foul, like young apes, Avrithed and bit at each other in the bloody gutter below for scraps of offal and rotten fruit and all the Avretched refuse of a street market Men, old and young, came lurching out through the low doorways of dirty taverns, and stood in the mud outside, bewildered, breathing beer into the reeking night ; after which they swaggered off, trampling brutally among the Avomen and children, on their way"], [181, "HARUN AL RASHID. 169 to the dens where they passed the hours of sleep. When the din of sounds permitted any utterance to be heard distinctly, the Avords were either some oath, or the use deadened complaint of one of the huckstering Avomen, or else the hideous Avail of a neglected infant. Over all rang out continually the coarse confident tones of the stall-keepers, as they shouted out their trade patter ; rattling the greasy coins as they received them, and noAV and again stopping to bite the edge of a thaler before thrusting it into the dirty leather pouch Avhich held their gains. It Avas Saturday night in the great slum market of Mannhausen. And into the midst of this squalid scene came tAvo young men, one of Avhom Avas the King of Franconia. His coming to the capital Avas the result of a decision come to after his last conA-ersation with the Count von Sigismark. Thoroughly Avearied by his Ministers' stubborn attitude, and the hopeless contradictions betAveen them and Johann, he had eagerly Avelcomed a suggestion from the latter that he should make a secret visit to Mannhausen, and there inquire for himself into the condition of the people, and learn from their OAvn lips Avhat Avere the burdens under Avhich they suffered. Fortunately for the success of the scheme, Maximilian had never permitted himself to be photographed since his accession, and had only been in the capital tAvice during the same period. Even on those two occasions most of his time had been spent in Mannhausen's famous art gallery, so that the chances of his being recognized Avere hardly worth taking into account,"], [182, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 170 The evening of their arrival had been devoted to pro curing suitable disguises. The next day Maximilian's guide had led him through the various public institutions of the city. He had gone into the Royal Courts, where he had seen injustice dispensed under all the forms of law. He had visited the great central infirmary and beheld the miserable patients, dreading the recovery Avhich Avould dismiss them to the greater misery of their homes. Finally Johann had taken him into the Lower House of the Legislature, having secured a pass from a member of the Extreme Left Avho Avas secretly in touch Avith the revolutionists. They found the Chamber in a state of unusual excite ment over the anticipated visit of the Imperial Kaiser. It had been intimated that only a limited number ofthe deputies could be admitted to the public ceremony of reception, and this snub had been the signal for a storm of indignation which Avas at its height Avhen Maximilian entered the gallery. He listened for an hour to the excited deputies, Avrangling for the right to pay homage to a despot, and at last remarked Avith some bitterness to Johann \u2014 \" If these are the kind of men whom the people them selves choose to govern them, God help the people ! \" \"Yes,\" said Johann, unmoved ; \"these are the repre sentatives of the bourgeoisie, and this is how they legislate for the Avorkers.\" They Avent out, and as the hour of eleven approached Johann drew his companion along towards the market, promising to show him the whole misery of the city at one glance."], [183, "HARUN AL RASHID. 171 When he found himself in the centre of the vile place, and its full details were revealed to him, Maximilian shrank appalled. He had never even conceived the existence of such wretchedness, of such loathsome degradation. \" What is this ? Where are Ave ? \" he demanded of his guide, clutching him by the arm. \"Who are these frightful creatures ? \" \"Your subjects,\" Avas the grave retort; \"those AA'hom your Ministers tell you have no grievances and no ungratisied desires.\" \" But it is horrible.

The boy had handsome dark eyes, with a pathetic look in them, and before Johann could warn him the King impulsively put his hand into his pocket and drew forth the largest silver coin he could find. The boy, Avho had perhaps never handled so much money at once in his life, actually tore it from Maximilian's fingers, and set up a wild yell, half of triumph, half of derision at the King's folly in parting Avith the coin. DraAvn by the sound, the whole ragged crew came rushing up and beset the King ; Avhile the first boy darted off for his life, to conceal his spoil from the thievish violence of his companions."], [184, "172 A CROWN OF STRAW. For some time the King and Johann strove in vain to beat off the swarm, Avho surrounded them on all sides, uttering threats and curses and entreaties all together, Avhile some of the more reckless made attempts to pick their pockets. A group of drunken men noticed Avhat Avas going on, and encouraged the lads, one or two of the younger men even coming up and assuming a threatening demeanour on the edge of the croAvd, as if to intimidate the two victims from resistance. At last one of the stall-keepers had his attention drawn to the row, and undertook to quell it, fearing possibly that his trade might suffer if scenes of open violence Avere allowed in the market. Taking up a long leather strap, he strode into the middle of the struggling mass of boys, and lashed them right and left Avith cruel force. The Avretches instantly recognized a master, and fled in all directions, leaving Maximilian little less shocked at the brutality of his rescuer than grateful for the deliverance. \" Was it necessary to cut so hard ? \" he ventured to say, after thanking the man. \" The young vermin ! Yes, and not half so hard as they deserve. They are thieves, the Avhole lot of them, and they will get Avorse as they grow older.

It Avas evident that she Avas long past any such feeling herself. Johann looked at the King, Avho turned aAvay, sick at heart. \" Well, here's a trifle toAvards your next dinner,\" said Johann, dropping a couple of coins into the AA-oman's skinny claw.

We can only Avait, and do our best to enlighten them.\" \" Well, at all events I am glad you do not make that a vital question,\" said Maximilian, a good deal relieved. \" I do not think I should care to hint at anything of that sort to the Chancellor.\" The revolutionist sighed. He saw that his pupil was still lagging far behind his own position, and that it Avould be necessary to use great caution in bringing him on."], [196, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 184 Presently Maximilian spoke again. \" Well, after Avhat I have seen and heard to-night I am convinced that you are in the right as to one thing. The present state of affairs is Avrong, and the only question is how to set about righting it. If my Ministers will do nothing, I promise you that I will go on with out them.\" For ansAver Johann turned half round and Avrung the King's hand in silence. \" Noav,\" continued Maximilian, \" I should like to see more of your party. I Avant to come in touch Avith them. You say there are three thousand members of the Socialist League in Mannhausen?\" \" In Franconia,\" corrected Johann. \" There are several provincial branches, but of course the one here is the most numerous, and gives the lead to the others.\" \"Tell me\" \u2014 the King spoke Avith a little hesitation \u2014 \" was it the League Avhich sent you to Neustadt ? \" \"Oh no ; certainly not. I came here as the agent of a small secret society, Avhich Avas founded in the reign of your father. The League is a public organization, and does not undertake any measures of that kind.\" \" Good. Now, Avhat I Avant you to do is to take me to a meeting of the League, so that I may see something of its Avorking for myself. When does it meet next ? \" Johann looked slightly disturbed at this bold sug gestion. KnoAving as he did the kind of language which Avas indulged in at these meetings, language of which the last few days had done much to make him realize the extravagance, he could hardly help feeling a little uneasy at the King's proposal to be present."], [197, "THE STATE PRISON. 185 \" There is a meeting to-morrow night,\" he responded cautiously, \" to AA'hich I thought of going, but I hardly knoAv Avhether it Avould be wise for you to come. Some of our members hold rather strong views about monarchy, and you might hear something \" Maximilian did not Avait for him to finish. \"Don't be afraid of shocking me,\" he said good humouredly. \" I dare say I shan't hear anything Avorse than I have deserved, and after all \" \u2014 Avith a side smile \u2014 \"it won't be Avorse than having a pistol pointed at my head.\" Johann blushed. But a new objection had occurred to him. \" I forgot to say that the meetings are only open to members,\" he observed. \" You see, we have to be cautious on account of the police. It has been rumoured that they mean to make a raid upon us before long.\" \"They Avon't dare to do that after Avhat I said to Herr Moritz,\" replied Maximilian, confidently. \"As to the other point, Avhat is there to prevent my becoming a member of the League ? \" This time the Socialist Avas fairly staggered. But strange as the suggestion sounded, it Avas difficult for him to think of any valid reason for rejecting it. On the contrary, it might be that such a step Avould be most desirable, by committing the King irrevocably, and giving the revolutionary party a stronger hold upon him than the mere private compact Avhich bound him to Johann personally. He turned the matter over in his mind, and it ended in his procuring a card of membership for Maximilian,"], [198, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 186 Avhich enrolled him as a member of the Socialist League, under the name of Karl Josef. On the follow ing evening at eight o'clock they crossed the threshold of the hall in which the Socialists Avere assembled. But they did not make their entrance together. Maximilian folloAved his introducer at a few paces in the rear, and slipped quietly into a back seat Avhere he Avas unobserved, Avhile Johann Avalked boldly forward through the gathering to the seats reserved for members of the governing committee of the League. As he made his Avay up the floor he became conscious that the eyes of all present Avere turned upon him. This Avas his first appearance among his comrades since his famous expedition to Neustadt, and public rumour had already informed those present that the man Avho had gone to the Castle on a mission to assassinate King Maximilian, had remained there as his guest and friend. Hence, most of the looks directed at the returning wanderer were of a decidedly unfriendly character, and there Avas a slight murmur in the hall when they saw one whom they had come to regard as a recreant coolly taking his former place among them as if nothing had happened. The stir dreAV the attention of the president, and, seeing that it Avould b; useless to proceed Avith the other business till the meeting Avas satisfied as to Johann's right to be present, he rose abruptly to invite him to make an explanation. \" Comrades,\" he said, \" I see in the hall a member of the League about Avhose doings Ave have heard a good deal during the last few days. It is currently reported"], [199, "THE STATE PRISON. 187 that he has been staying in the Castle of Neustadt, and that though he Avent there with an object Avhich some of us may not have approved, he is noAV high in the favour of the King. It is naturally difficult for us to reconcile this Avith his continued membership of our body ; but Ave are Socialists, and avc judge no man un heard. Before Ave proceed Avith the ordinary business of the meeting, therefore, I deem it right to call upon comrade Johann Mark for an explanation, and I ask all present to give him a fair hearing.\" These Avords Avere received with applause, and Johann instantly mounted the platform. His appearance Avas the signal for a chilling silence, Avhich struck unpleasantly on his nerves, used as he had been to be greeted Avith applause as one of the faA'ourite orators of the society. Nevertheless, he did not allow himself to be daunted, but began at once, facing the audience boldly, and speaking in a loud, steady voice. \" Comrades, I am glad that you are at least Avilling to grant me a hearing, although it seems that some of you have already condemned me in my absence. I did not come here to-night to defend my character as a Socialist and a Republican \u2014 a more advanced Republican, perhaps, than any man in the room. I rely upon my own record in the past : I Avas fighting for our principles in the dark days of King Leopold, and it is not likely that I should desert them now that Ave are on the eve of a glorious triumph. I came here simply to tell you as friends and fellow-AVorkers of what I have been trying to do for the cause. The president has referred to the object Avith AA'hich I Avent to Neustadt."], [200, "188 A CROWN OF STRAW. I Avent there to shoot King Maximilian Avith this pistol \" \u2014 a thrill ran through the assembly as he produced the Aveapon and held it out before their gaze \u2014 \"and I did so because I believed him to be a bad and Avorthless ruler.\" Here the speaker Avas interrupted for a moment by ironical applause from some of his listeners. He Avent on Avith a heightened colour. \" If I still believed him to be bad and Avorthless, I should use this Aveapon still. If in a year's time, or in ten years' time, I believe it, I shall go there again and do Avhat I meant to have done this time. The only reason Avhy King Maximilian is still alive is because I have been convinced that, Avhatever he may have been in the past, he noAV sincerely Avishes to do Avhatever he can to help us in the objects we have at heart\" At this point the incredulity of the meeting broke forth in scornful murmurs, Avhich the president in vain attempted to suppress. Johann felt his anger kindling. \" I Avas promised a fair hearing ! \" he shouted out above the disturbance. \" Hear me out before you interrupt. You have been quick enough to assume that the King had converted me to the cause of reaction : did it never occur to you as possible that I might have converted the King to the cause of revolution ? I tell you plainly, as I stand here, that there is no man in this room Avho, as I believe, is more sincere in desiring to see our principles triumph than Maximilian IV.\" Some of the audience could not refrain from mocking laughter at this statement. The rest stared at the speaker in stubborn disbelief."], [201, "THE STATE PRISON. 189 \"You do not believe me. I dare say not. You think, perhaps, that the King has only to hold up his hand in order to bring about everything which Ave Avant\" (Hear, hear.) \"Fools, have you ever realized Avhat a government is ; that it is a huge organization, running in a groove, from Avhich it is as difficult to turn it Avithout reducing the Avhole state of society to chaos as it is to throAv an express train off the rails Avithout upsetting it ? That is Avhy I have been staying at Neustadt, that I might see Avith my OAvn eyes Avhat the difficulties are, and do Avhat I could to help the King in overcoming them. Do you think I have learned nothing in these few days? I have learned a great deal, and this most of all, that no one man, not even though he be a king, can change the Avhole structure of society at a moment's notice. There are the ministers to deal Avith, the legislature, the sullen resistance of the Avhole official and propertied classes. Give him time, and if nothing changes for the better at the end of the next six months I pledge myself to leaA'e the King and come back to you.\" The meeting had been set against Johann by the air of superior knoAvledge Avhich he had assumed, as much as by the unpalatable conclusions to Avhich he sought to lead them. The murmurs of suspicion and dislike swelled into a tumult as he Avent on. At the first break a voice from the centre of the hall demanded \u2014 \" Let him abdicate ! \" This sentiment was received Avith a sound of cheering Avhich told hoAv strongly the feelings of the audience Avere inflamed against the King and his champion."], [202, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 190 Maximilian, Avho had listened to it all Avith doAvncast head, moved uneasily in his seat, and looked for a moment as if he would have made for the platform himself. But Johann stilled the clamour with a contemptuous Avave of his hand. \" I Avas not afraid of King Maximilian's guards,\" he cried, \"and I am not afraid of you. If there is a man in this room Avho is prepared to take this pistol from me and go with it to the Palace, let him come forward.\" And he held it out defiantly. The effect was magical. Not one of his judges responded to the challenge. The Avhole crowd shrank from his glance, and allowed him to continue in silence. \" You ask me Avhy he does not abdicate ? What good Avould that do ? Do you think that a dull-Avitted boy like Prince Ernest Avould be any better for you than Maximilian ? How Avould you like to have the Princess Hermengarde for a Regent ? \" The Princess's name Avas received with hisses. \" I thought so. I thought you Avould at least see that much.\" He could not refrain from taunting them, forgetting that his true object Avas not to silence but to persuade. Maximilian, watching the scene, AA-as tortured by the unskilfulness of his advocate. It Avas not thus that he had Avrought on Johann himself in the gallery at Neustadt \" Surely it is better for us,\" the orator proceeded, \" to have a man on the throne Avho sympathizes Avith us. Even if the King fails to perform Avhat I hope from him, he leaves us free to go on Avith our own work inde pendently. It is not as if I Avere asking you to desist"], [203, "THE STATE PRISON. 191 from the movement. No, I rather urge you to go on more boldly noAV than ever. Do not trust in me or in the King, but act exactly as you would have done if I had never gone to Neustadt.\" These Avords produced a favourable impression, and for the first time there Avas a slight sound of applause. Johann eagerly followed up his success. \"And you can go on Avith all the more confidence, knoAving that you have a friend at Court. The King will protect you from your enemies. Only the day before yesterday I happen to know that he gave orders that the police Avere to take no steps against you Avithout his permission.\" While his lips Avere yet moving, and as if these words had been a preconcerted signal, a loud Avhistle sounded outside, the door Avas violently burst in, and a body of police Avith drawn staves marched into the hall. An exciting scene folloAved. The bulk of those present sprang to their feet and made a Avild rush for the doorway, through Avhich some of them escaped, only to fall into the hands of a reserve force stationed in the street outside. Others, more determined, stood their ground, and engaged in a free fight Avith the officers Avho attempted to capture them, Avhile the president sat pale and motionless in his chair, Avaiting to be arrested ; and Johann, fairly unmanned under the influence of a feeling of sickening despair, reeled backward and clung for support to the table, Avhile his horrified glance traversed the miserable scene. Maximilian himself, after the first shock of alarm, stood up quietly to deliver himself into custody, but"], [204, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 192 underneath this apparent calm the fiercest rage possessed him, and he inly swore to make the author of this outrage bitterly repent his disobedience. A very few minutes sufficed for all resistance to be quelled. The prisoners Avere handcuffed together in pairs and marched off through the deserted streets, and as night fell Maximilian IV., King of Franconia, found himself the inmate of a cell in his OAvn State prison. So large Avas the number of arrests made at the meeting that even the ample accommodation at the disposal of the governor of the prison seemed likely to prove insufficient. Each man, as he passed in through the gates, had his name taken doAvn in a book, and was assigned to a separate cell. When the Avhole of the vacant cells had been thus allotted, a number of prisoners remained undisposed of. While the governor Avas Avondering how heAvas to deal Avith the surplus, he Avas relieved to see the Minister of the Interior arrive on the scene. \" Welcome, Herr Moritz ! \" he exclaimed. \" I was just fearing that I might have to send for your Excellency.\" And he quickly explained how matters stood. The Minister stepped up to the governor's desk \u2014 it was in the bureau through which the prisoners Avere passed on being received into the gaol \u2014 and cast his eyes carelessly over the pages of the admission book. \" There is only one thing for it, Herr Governor,\" he said, in answer. \" You must put them two in a cell.\" \" Of course that is against the regulations, but if your Excellency authorizes it ? \" said the other, hesitating."], [205, "THE STATE PRISON. 193 \" Certainly, I authorize it. By the Avay, I see a name here of a man Avhom I used to know something about \u2014 Karl Josef. You have put him in No. 79. Is that a fairly comfortable room ? \" \" It is one of the best in the prison. Noav you mention it, I remember I Avas struck by something distinguished in the air of that prisoner, and that Avas why I gave it to him.\" \" It Avas a proof of your discrimination. Let him have a respectable companion, if you can find one.\" \" Oh, I think I shall be able to dispose of the rest Avithout using his room, if your Excellency takes an interest in him.\" Herr Moritz froAvned. \" Certainly not I am not interested in any man Avho has broken the law. Let him be treated exactly like the rest.\" The governor hastened to murmur an apology, and theAvork of taking the prisoners' names and distributing them among the cells was resumed. The Minister stood idly looking on till a prisoner entered, in the custody of an officer, who appeared to be unconnected with the rest, and Avho gave his name as Hans Triibner. Then Herr Moritz bent over and whispered in the gOArernor's ear \u2014 \" He looks a better class of man. Suppose you send him to No. 79.\" The governor nodded and gave the required directions. Shortly afterwards the Minister bade him a friendly good night and strolled away. 0"], [206, "194 CHAPTER XIV HERR MORITZ'S PLAN. The intelligence of Maximilian's mysterious departure had fallen like a bombshell upon the conference between the Princess Hermengarde and Von Sigismark. Striving to command her secret thoughts, the Princess, Avith a nod, dismissed her henchman Karl, and turned an inquiring look upon the old Count. Interpreting this as an invitation, the Count, Avho Avas unable to Avholly hide his consternation, returned slowly to his chair. He sat doAvn, and for some moments scrutinized the countenance of his royal ally. But it Avas in vain that he sought to read anything in that stern and composed face. At length he Avas obliged to break silence. \"This is a new development, Madam. I confess I was not prepared for it When I left the King an hour or two ago, he had accepted a proposal on the part of Herr Moritz and myself to hold an inquiry into the alleged grievances of the people, and he seemed content to Avait for the result before taking any further steps.\""], [207, "HERR MORITZ'S PLAN. 195 \" Herr Moritz ? Is he still in the Castle ? \" \" Yes, I believe so.\" The Chancellor replied with reluctance. He did not wish his subordinate introduced into the intrigue of Avhich Hermengarde Avas the centre. \"That is well. We may have to avail ourselves of his services presently.\" \"True. I did not think of that. You mean to ascer tain Avhere they have gone ? \" \" I mean, to have them followed. I know where they have gone.\" \" You knoAv ! \" The Count could not conceal his surprise. \" Is it so very difficult to tell ? Surely you do not think this man has taken Maximilian away on some country excursion ? There is only one place to which he would be likely to lead him. You said yourself that there had been talk of an inquiry into the condition of the people. Of course they have set out to make that inquiry. You will find them in Mannhausen.\" Von Sigismark started to his feet. \" Of course ! Pardon me, Madam, but, with your permission, I will go at once and telegraph to have the trains met and examined.\" Hermengarde shook her head. \" I am not sure that Avill be the wisest course. This affair must not be allowed to get abroad. We cannot afford to run any risks. It will be far better for Herr Moritz to go himself to Mannhausen, and put detectives on the track of this man Mark. He is sure to be known to the police, and by watching his usual haunts, they"], [208, "196 A CROWN OF STRAW. are certain to find him sooner or later ; and then it will be an easy task to find the King.\" \"And when Ave have found him ?\" \"Really, that is a question Avhich I have not con sidered. It is hardly for me to teach the King's Ministers their duty to the King.\" The Chancellor felt disconcerted. He began to repent of his over-cautious tactics in their previous conversation. He saw that he was noAV in the position of one asking for assistance, and that the Princess realized, and Avas preparing to take advantage of, that fact \" Perhaps,\" he responded, \" I am presuming on your goodness in discussing Avith me other proceedings of his Majesty _during the last few days. I think I understood you to confide in me that you had entertained certain fears as to his \" \" Fears as to his marriage. Certainly,\" put in the Princess quickly, as the old courtier hesitated. \" Pardon me, Madam, I think you even Avent a little further,\" he retorted, determined not to be put off. \" Unless I deceived myself I understood that your Royal Highness felt some alarm as to his Majesty's conduct generally \u2014 alarm Avhich had reference to the unhappy calamity Avhich has overtaken other members of the Royal House.\" This Avas plain speaking at last. Hermengarde care fully restrained herself from any display of eagerness. \"Perhaps I spoke more rashly than I should have done ; but I felt that with such an old friend as yourself, and such a loyal servant of the King, I could unburden my mind quite freely. However, you did not share my"], [209, "HERR MORITZ'S PLAN. 197 anxiety on that score, and I trust you have dismissed my Avords from your mind.\" \" Again pardon me ; no. On the contrary, I have most carefully Aveighed and considered them, and par ticularly so in the light of this last singular freak on the King's part.\" The Princess was a Avoman She could not resist the temptation of a sneer. \" I see. It is the King's conduct in abandoning your counsels for those of Herr Mark Avhich has opened your eyes.\" 11 The old man's eyes gleamed dangerously for an instant. Then he pounced like a hawk on the opening she had given him. \" If you think, Madam, for one moment that I am capable of being actuated by any personal pique in a matter of such grave importance, I have only to apolo gize for having intruded on you so long, and to ask permission to retire.\" Hermengarde saw her mistake. She put out her hand with a soothing gesture. \" No, no, my dear Count ; you have quite mistaken my meaning. I did not intend my Avords to be taken seriously. It is of the last importance that you and I should not misunderstand each other in so delicate a crisis. Let us throw off all reserve, and discuss the situation plainly. Are you prepared to do so, if I set the example ? \" \" I am.\" \" Very good. I will put the facts as briefly as I can, and you interrupt me if I omit anything. First, let me"], [210, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 198 see how we are interested. My son is at present the heir to the throne. It is, therefore, to my interest that the King should not marry. Merely to prevent a mar riage Avith this girl or that would not be of much use, because, if he lived and retained his mental capacity, it would be easy for him to find a Avise to Avhom I could raise no objection. Indeed, he is quite capable of going off and contracting a secret marriage ; and it is partly to guard against such a step that I have brought this girl to the Palace.\" The Count nodded emphatically. \" I, therefore, or rather my son, have everything to gain, and nothing to lose, if it should turn out that our fears are well founded, and the King has to be put under restraint. Now, Avhat is your position ? For ten years the King has entrusted you with supreme power ; and, if I may be permitted to say so, you have used it Avith admirable discretion. The country has been quiet, and the Court has been contented. But now, Avhat has happened ? A stranger \u2014 Avorse, a criminal \u2014 has sprung out of the earth, and, like Jonah's gourd, he has groAvn up and overshadowed you in a single night. He has converted the King to schemes Avhich not only involve your political overthroAV, but Avhich may Avell lead to a revolution, and the spoliation of the Avhole class to Avhichyou belong. And he has an additional hold upon him, through his mad infatuation for his cousin. As things stand, therefore, your fall is merely a question of months, perhaps only of days.\" The Chancellor interposed a faint objection. \"Before dispensing Avith my services, his Majesty"], [211, "HERR MORITZ'S PLAN. 199 Avould at least have to find some man of responsibility who was able to take my place. And Avhere Avould he get one, prepared to take office on such conditions ? \" \" AnyAvhere. Out of the ranks of your OAvn colleagues, Avho are all ready to step into your shoes. Perhaps Herr Moritz is at this moment meditating a scheme for persuading the King that he will make a more pliable instrument than you.\" The Chancellor frowned, but attempted no reply. \" On the other hand, supposing the King to lose his poAver, Avho Avould replace him as Regent? My son Avould naturally take the office when he came of age, but until then, on whom Avould it devolve ? \" \" On one of two persons,\" said Von Sigismark, seeing that she desired him to answer. \" On yourself, or on the Count von Eisenheim.\" \" Von Eisenheim ! \" exclaimed the Princess in some surprise. \" But he is too remote. Surely the Council Avould not pass over the mother of the King ? \u2014 I mean of the King-expectant.\" There is an old saying, once familiar in the mouths of statesmen, that deposed monarchs seldom live long. Was it the recollection of this proverb that made the subtle courtier stare so strangely at the Princess when she made her unfortunate slip ? \" No doubt you are right,\" was all he remarked. \"At all events,\" pursued the Princess, \"that is a matter in which I shall count on your good offices, if I may.\" The Chancellor bowed low. \" In that case,\" she Avent on, \" I need not say that"], [212, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 200 there Avould be no change in your position. Politics have always been distasteful to me, and I do not think Ernest is likely to take much interest in them for many years to come. You Avould remain as you Avere till the other day, the virtual ruler of Franconia, instead of holding office at the caprice of one Avhose state of mind is becoming only too apparent, and subject to the interference and dictation of an upstart Avho aims at nothing short of Avholesale robbery and murder.\" \" You have said enough, Madam. If the King is indeed going mad, Ave cannot too soon have the fact ascertained.\" Hermengarde leant back in her chair and fixed a long and searching gaze upon the Chancellor. This time it Avas she Avho failed to penetrate beneath the impassive mask of the courtier. \"And hoAv are Ave to ascertain it? \" she said at length, putting the question apparently Avith reluctance. \" We can shoAV the public that he is contemplating marriage Avith a peasant girl ; that he has made an assassin his bosom friend ; that he has urged his Ministers to start a revolution, and has gone off secretly to the slums of Mannhausen to fraternize Avith the enemies of society and of his throne.\" \"All that is not enough. The public will expect medical evidence.\" \" You mean \" Dr. Krauss must be consulted.\" \" He is here.\" \"Here?\" \" Yes, in the Castle. I sent for him two days ago.\""], [213, "HERR MORITZ'S PLAN. 201 Von Sigismark trembled. This Avoman's terrible activity frightened him. He felt himself, as it were, swept off his feet. It Avas some time before he ventured to make a fresh remark. \" Have you considered, Madam, hoAV Ave are to bring his Majesty and the Doctor together? \" One of those strange still smiles, Avhich, in a Avoman like Hermengarde, Avere more menacing than a frown, came on her lips for an instant, and vanished again. \" Is that indispensable ? \" Avas all she said. \" Undoubtedly. We cannot expect Dr. Krauss to act on hearsay. He will require to examine the King personally, in order to arrive at an opinion.\" \" Indeed. Then in that case I am afraid I do not see any immediate chance of success.\" Von Sigismark cogitated, Avhile the Princess kept a cold Avatchful glance upon his face, out of the corners of her eyes. Soon an idea occurred to him ; he resisted it for a time, but at length gave Avay to it, and expressed it in words. \" Herr Moritz is here. He is a man of considerable shrewdness. Why not consult him ? \" \"But that Avould involve taking him into our confidence.\" \" True, Madam ; but, after all, what have we to fear ? Our action is perfectly loyal.

But is this colleague of yours to be trusted ? \" \"Absolutely. His devotion to me is unbounded, and I can ansAver for his discretion as much as for my OAvn.\" \" In that case, I consent.\" Hermengarde summoned the page, and despatched him to the Chancellor's cabinet While they waited, the tAvo intriguers fell into attitudes like those of Avrestlers reposing for a brief spell in the intervals of an exhausting struggle. It Avas Avith no small surprise that the Minister of the Interior received the summons. But no trace of this feeling appeared in his countenance as he entered the room, and with perfect calmness saluted the Princess, and accepted the seat which she assigned to him Avith a silent gesture. The Chancellor addressed him. \"We have sent for you, Herr Moritz, to invite your co-operation in an affair of an extremely delicate nature, in Avhich the strictest secrecy is essential.\" The Minister boAved in a matter-of-fact Avay, evidently quite unconscious of Avhat Avas coming. \" The fact is that the Princess Hermengarde and my self have lately become uneasy about the King.\" Herr Moritz could not repress a slight start. \" You had the advantage of seeing his Majesty to-day, and I believe you fully shared my sense of the danger to Avhich his"], [215, "HERR MORITZ'S PLAN. 203 intimacy Avith this fanatical Socialist was likely to lead. Well, already Ave have had a warning of Avhat is coming. The King and this man have left the Castle by stealth, and we suspect that they have gone secretly to Mann hausen.\" Herr Moritz's face showed a grave apprehension. \" I see that you realize the seriousness of this.

But that is not all. Of course, as soon as Ave know Avhere the King is, we can bring pressure to bear on him to return ; but there is a more important question behind.

I do not wish to put it more strongly than that\" \" I quite understand, sir.\" \"Very good. Then, as soon as his Majesty returns, we want to induce him, if possible, to see the physician, Dr. Krauss. The question is, how can we bring this about without provoking painful suspicions? I thought that your suggestions might be useful as to this.\" \" Would it not be possible to get his Majesty to con sult Dr. Krauss as to some other ailment ? \" \" Impossible.

Go, and do not lose a moment in carrying out Avhat you propose.\" Herr Moritz bowed sedately and left the room. The old Chancellor folloAA'ed, gnawing his lip. Hermengarde, left to herself, remained motionless in her seat for a considerable time, plunged in profound thought.

Giving a slight stamp of her foot to draw their atten tion, the Princess addressed her son \u2014 \" Ernest, do you not see that Lady Gertrude is ready for another game ? \" The boy turned to her, froAvning, but did not rise from his seat. \" It is my fault,\" Gertrude hastened to explain. \" I Avas compelled to go and see some one, and I have only this minute returned.\" Hermengarde gave her a quick glance of suspicion, then she remarked, Avithout seeming to address any one in particular \u2014 \" It seems that the King has just left the Castle for a few days.

The Princess smiled pleasantly. \"You forget he did not know you were in the Castle,\" she said. Then, turning once more to Ernest, she added \u2014 \" Come, sir, Lady Gertrude is waiting. Dorothea, I Avant you in the other room.\" Dorothea arose and folloAved her mistress, Avhile Ernest grudgingly took his place at the chessboard. The next tAvo days in the Castle passed Avithout incident. Dorothea Avas still kept secluded to some extent from the Court, but as she greAv more accustomed to her neAv sphere, she gradually enlarged the number of her friends. Enemies she had none, Avith perhaps a single exception, for her gentleness and simplicity Avon over all who approached her. Even the Count von Stahlen was conquered, and announced in confidence to his satellite that he himself stood in serious danger of becoming the Poacher's Son-in-laAv. The fondness for her society shown by the young Prince Avas not long in exciting remark, a fondness Avhich his mother seemed doubtful Avhether to encourage or restrain. All the aAvkAvardness and constraint Avhich marked his intercourse with the ladies of the Court vanished Avhen he found himself in the company of the peasant girl. He came to her on all occasions, took her into his confidence about everything, and Avould have asked her to ride out Avith him if the Princess had not interfered. In the mean time, Hermengarde Avas anxiously aAvait ing intelligence from Mannhausen. From time to time she sent for the Chancellor and questioned him, but"], [219, "HERR MORITZ'S PLAN. 207 found he was still without news. At last, early on the Monday morning he came to her, bringing the following laconic message \u2014 \" I have carried out the arrangement. K. will arrive at noon. \" P.

More from shame than from prudence, he was careful to avoid betraying his identity to those around him, Avhether the Socialists, in Avhose eyes he must have appeared a deceiver, or the police, to Avhom his presence might seem too much like a freak of madness. His Avisest course Avas evidently to wait till he Avas alone in his cell, and then endeavour to communicate privately Avith his Ministers. Nevertheless, it Avas Avith a feeling of deep disquietude that he heard the iron-bound door clang to upon him, and the key grate in the lock. No sooner did he find himself left alone than he gave Avay to a burst of anger. \" This ends my submission to the Chancellor ! \" he cried, striding wildly up and down the narroAV limits of the chamber. \" The moment I am out of here I will get rid of him, and have a Minister AA'ho will obey me instead of thwarting and defying me.

I must sound him on the first opportunity, and find whether he is willing to act.\" For some time he continued to pace the floor, storm ing against his captivity, and revolving the means of procuring his release. Deep doAvn in his heart there Avas a faint, undefined dread as to Avhether release would be so much a matter of course as he had assumed ; whether the cell in Avhich he found himself might not prove the ante-room to another and a more terrible prison. But the presence of this shadoAvy dread he AA'ould not recognize, curbing his thoughts and forcing them to dwell on the punishment he should aAvard his disobedient Chancellor. While he Avas still restlessly moving to and fro, he heard steps in the corridor outside, and the rattling of a key placed in the lock. The door Avas opened, and a Avarder came in, folloAved by the individual Avho had just been entered as Hans Trtibner in the governor's book. \"What does this mean ? \" demanded the King angrily, Avith something of a royal air. \"The prison is full, sir,\" returned the warder Avith some respect, \" and we are obliged to put tAvo prisoners in every cell.\" With that he turned and Avent out again, locking the door after him. Maximilian made an effort to restrain his indignation. \" Are you one of the Socialists ? \" he asked the neAv comer, who had advanced toAvards him. \" I was arrested along Avith the others,\" ansAvered the stranger, speaking as to a comrade, but Avith a certain p"], [222, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 210 deference Avhich caused Maximilian to regard him Avith a closer scrutiny. \" May I ask your name ? \" \" I am called Hans Trubner. And you ? \" The King repeated the name he had himself assumed. They sat doAvn and entered into conversation. After a few remarks had been exchanged on the probable result of the evening's events, Herr Trubner turned to the subject of Johann's address. \"What did you think of Johann Mark?\" he asked. \" Do you believe there is any good to be got out of King Maximilian ? \" \" Why not ? \" was the answer. \" Why should not the King be as sincere as Ave are ? \" \" Because his interests are totally opposed to ours. We are republicans, aiming to overthrow royalty, and deprive him of his croAvn.\" \" That does not make it impossible to sympathize Avith you.

He stared at Maximilian strangely, and sank his voice almost to a Avhisper as he put the next question. \"Pardon me if I hardly knoAv hoAV to take your Avords. Of course I know the hereditary tendencies of the royal house ; but do you suggest that there may be some connection between those sad tendencies and this new attitude of the King toAvards our party ? \" Maximilian had grown paler, but he preserved the composure of his voice, as he replied \u2014 \" I have ahvays understood that scientists traced a sort of connection between religious enthusiasm and actual mania. Where are Ave to draw the line betAveen sanity and insanity ? What do you say yourself? Are not all men insane on some point ?

But at its close he shook his head. \" No doubt you are right in the main. No doubt in many cases the line may be a difficult one to draw. But there are other cases in Avhich madness is as clearly marked a disease as cancer or small-pox. And this is especially so Avhere the disease is proved to be hereditary in a family.\" Maximilian's manner became slightly more agitated. For a moment he spoke as if forgetting his assumed character. \" Ah, that is it ! \" he exclaimed passionately. \" That is the true hereditary curse, not the madness, but the suspicion it engenders in other's minds ! In the case of an ordinary individual you see nothing serious in a little eccentricity, a certain degree of enthusiasm ; you may sneer at him, you may even admire him. But when you are told that his grandfather cut his throat, or his great grandfather died in an asylum, then you shake your head and Avhisper, ' Beware of him ! He is shoAving the hereditary tendency. He is going mad ! ' \" He stopped, and glanced with a certain apprehension at his listener. But the other showed no sign of surprise at this outbreak. On the contrary, he appeared to have been considerably impressed by the King's Avords, as he satAvith bent head and eyes drooped toAvards the ground."], [225, "No. 79. 213 \"Then Avhat do you think really,\" he said, at length, directing his gaze once more at Maximilian, \"is the King's state of mind ? \" \" I think he is as mad as most other men, and as mad as he ever will be,\" Avas the cynical response. And, as if umvilling to prolong the com'ersation, Maximilian rose from his seat, and again began rest lessly pacing the narrow limits of the chamber. His felloAV-prisoner sat on, watching him silently. A little time afterwards the door of the cell was again opened. A strange Avarder appeared, Avho cast his eye indiffe rently over the two prisoners, as he inquired \u2014 \"Which of you is named Hans Trubner?\" The man so designated instantly rose, and, in obedience to the Avarder's instructions, followed him from the cell. Left to himself, Maximilian, Avho had taken no out- Avard notice of the incident, flung himself at full length on the floor and groaned aloud. Presently he raised his head sharply, and cast alarmed glances over the Avails and ceiling of the room. Then he rose quickly and settled himself in a calmer attitude on a chair. Hardly had he done so when the sound of the door being unlocked again broke upon his ear. He turned round, and saw the door open to admit the Minister ofthe Interior. He came in quietly, closed the door behind him, and stood in front of the King. Herr Moritz had taken his measures Avith some skill, to avoid giving rise to suspicions on the part of the governor of the prison, or any of the subordinate agents whom it was necessary to employ."], [226, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 214 Acting in pursuance ofthe scheme originally submitted by him to Princess Hermengarde and the Chancellor, he had meant to use the Socialist meeting as a trap in Avhich to catch the King's Socialist companion, and thus learn his master's Avhereabouts. But as soon as he learnt through a trusted spy that Maximilian himself had entered the hall of meeting, he had determined on the bold step of arresting all present, rightly judging that the King would refrain from disclosing himself at the first, and that he would thus have an opportunity of at once carrying out the second and more delicate part of his task. Part of his proceedings has been already described. It only remained for the Minister, after alloAving a suitable time to elapse, to return to the prison, and inform the governor that he had received secret information Avhich made it desirable for him to privately examine the prisoner entered as Karl Josef. To avoid provoking curiosity he did not make any direct reference to the other inmate of No. 79, but contrived to meet him, and exchange a few hurried Avhispers Avith him, in one of the prison corridors. It Avas im mediately after this that he presented himself before the King. Maximilian's first seeling on beholding the Minister was one of angry astonishment. But almost instantane ously he contrived to quell all outward signs of excite ment. Assuming his most stern and distant manner, he demanded \u2014 \" Well, sir, why are you here ? \" \" I have come to ask if your Majesty has any commands for me,\" Avas the Minister's calm reply."], [227, "No. 79, 215 \" Hoav did you know I Avas here ? \" Avas his next question. \" I thought it Avas my duty to know it, Sire. Your disappearance caused some uneasiness in the Palace, and knowing something of the dangers to which your Majesty's person might be exposed among the revolu tionists in Mannhausen, I ventured to take precautions for your safety.\" \" In other Avords, you have had me watched ? \" \"Only by the most trusted of my officers, Sire, on whose discretion I can entirely rely.\" \" This is a pretty state of affairs. Can I not go about in my own capital without being dogged by police spies ? \" \"Your Majesty had given me no orders. It is the duty of my Department to watch over your safety, and in the absence of any express prohibition I did not dare to leave your Majesty Avithout protection. There is no croAvned head in Europe, Sire, except the Queen of England, Avho is not similarly watched. And even she is, on the rare occasions when she visits her capital.\" \" And why is she not Avatched ? Because her people are free,\" said the King, sharply. The Minister permitted himself a faint smile. \" The English are a strange race, Sire. It is the best country to be a rebel in, and the Avorst one to be a ruler in, that I knoAv.\" Maximilian returned to a former remark of the Minister's. \" You talk of having no orders. You have disobeyed"], [228, "216 A CROWN OF STRAW. the only order I did give you. I said that no more proceedings Avere to be taken against the Socialists Avithout my express authority, and you have dared to make these Avholesalc arrests. \" \" I have to humbly ask your Majesty's pardon. It is true that I received that order, and I fully intended to obey it. Unfortunately, not anticipating that any step of this kind Avas in immediate contemplation by the police, I neglected to give them instructions in time. It appears that they acted on their ordinary principles, Avhich are to Avatch all meetings, and break them up directly they become seditious. I am given to under stand that language disrespectful to your Majesty Avas being freely indulged in on this occasion, and those in charge had, of course, no idea that your Majesty Avas present\" Maximilian froAvned sullenly at this rather lame ex planation. But to express open disbelief in it must have meant the immediate resignation of the Minister, probably of the entire Ministry \u2014 in short, a declaration of open Avar. And he Avas still on the AA'rong side of the door of No. 79. Nor Avere these the only considera tions present to his mind, as he rather ungraciously responded \u2014 \"Well, sir, I will say no more on the subject. You Avill of course order the immediate release of all the persons arrested at the meeting.\" Herr Moritz boAved. \"Your Majesty has only to sign an order to that effect.\" The King looked someAvhat relieved. Then a sudden"], [229, "No. 79, 217 thought seemed to cross his mind, and he gave a bitter smile. An instant after his manner changed again, and he addressed Herr Moritz in a more friendly tone than he had yet used. \"Be seated ; I have something more to say to you.\" Up till noAV the Minister had remained standing. He noAV obeyed the King Avith an expression of face which showed that he, too, felt that a critical moment had been safely passed. \"What is your age, Herr Moritz ? \" \" Forty-four, Sire,\" replied the Minister, with an intona tion of surprise at the question. \" And the Count von Sigismark's ? \" Herr Moritz instantly became grave. \" I believe, seventy-one or two.\" \" Exactly ; the older a man is the more difficult it is for him to receive new ideas. It has occurred to me once or tAvice lately that I have been rather unreasonable in expecting Von Sigismark to appreciate my views on the subject of social reform. Possibly if I had discussed them with you in the first place Ave should have been more likely to understand each other.\" \" I should esteem it an honour to listen to your vieAvs at any time, Sire. At the same time, of course my position forbids me to initiate any practical steps which are not sanctioned by my chief.\" The King caught at what looked like a hint in these Avords. \" If that means that in order to secure your active assistance I must alter existing arrangements, I see no reason why that should not be done. The Count has"], [230, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 218 been Chancellor a good many years, but it is time that he thought of making Avay for a younger man.\" Herr Moritz raised his hand deprecatingly. \" I fear I have misled you, Sire. I could not willingly accept any arrangements which included the dismissal of the Count von Sigismark.\" \" Why ? \" \" Because, but for the Count, I should noAV be a Government clerk at a thousand florins a-year. He has made me Avhat I am ; I owe everything to him.\" Maximilian bit his lip, and then gave vent to a deep sigh. \" I have found one faithful man in my kingdom,\" he murmured, \"and he is faithful to my enemy!\" \" Do not say that, Sire ! \" remonstrated Moritz. \" I am certain that the Chancellor Avould not oppose your Majesty in anything unless he believed it Avas against your own interests.\" Maximilian's only reply was a mournful smile. Then, rising to his feet, he observed\u2014 \" We are forgetting the release of the prisoners, and it is very late. Make out an order at once for me to sign, and send on a confidential messenger to the Palace to prepare rooms for me to-night. I shall sleep in Mannhausen and return to Neustadt in the morning.\" \" You shall be obeyed, Sire.\" The Minister quitted the cell, and in less than half an hour afterwards the astonished governor found himself passing out his crowd of inmates as quickly as he had passed them in."], [231, "219 CHAPTER XVI. THE FIRST AVARNING. When Maximilian found himself outside the gates of the State prison, it Avas not Avith the light step of a captive released that he took his Avay to the Palace. Once in his own apartments, which had been hastily got ready for him, he issued strict injunctions that no one should be admitted to his presence. If Herr Mark should come to the Palace, he Avas to be requested to follow the King to Neustadt in the morning. These orders given, the young monarch locked the door on all his attendants and gave himself up to the flood of emotion Avhich was surging within him. Without en tertaining even the pretence of seeking slumber, he remained all night in his cabinet, seated in an attitude of gloomy dejection, or dragging his steps Avearily and almost furtively up and down the room. Sometimes he came to a halt opposite the various pictures hang ing upon the walls, most of them portraits of those of his ancestors Avho had Avorn the Franconian croAvn. Once, in a momentary transport, he tore down the picture of his wretched father, and seemed about to"], [232, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 220 destroy it ; but more sober thoughts came to his aid, and he reluctantly replaced it on the Avail. Thus the hours of the night passed, in miserable self-communing, and his face greAV paler and more haggard, and the dark lines of exhaustion deepened themselves under his eyes, and his hair swept in dis order over his sorehead ; and he passed by degrees into a condition of listless apathy Avhich ended in a brief spell of unrestful sleep. With the first streak of dawn he rose, and Avent and looked at himself in a mirror AA'hich decorated the Avail over the fireplace. The sight of his OAvn aspect made him shrink. WithdraAving into a neighbouring apart ment, furnished as a dressing-room, he made a hurried toilette, remembering for the first time to exchange the disguise in Avhich he had been arrested for clothes a little less inconsistent Avith his rank. This done, he rang for his attendants, snatched a hasty breakfast, and departed in a closed carriage to take the first train for Neustadt. There was another passenger at the railway station, also setting out for the King's destination, a passenger Avhose form was shrouded in a long dark overcoat, while his face was overshadowed by a Avide-brimmed hat. Maximilian caught a hasty glimpse of him in passing, but turned quickly aAvay, making no sign nor gesture of recognition. Two hours later the King Avas back in his apartments at the Castle, Avhere his first act Avas to despatch Karl in search of the musician Bernal. Not till he heard the well-known step of his old friend in the ante-room did"], [233, "THE FIRST WARNING. 221 his face relax for an instant from the expression of nervous dread and wretchedness Avhich had haunted it ever since his sojourn in the prison. But Avhen Bernal entered the King's presence there Avas a constraint in his manner Avhich Avas new in Maxi milian's experience of him. Instead of Avelcoming his friend Avith open arms, the musician stood aloof, coldly Avaiting to be addressed. It instantly struck the King that this coolness arose from jealousy at his departure in the Socialist's com pany, Avithout having taken Auguste into his con fidence, and he hastened to apologize for this breach of friendship. But the musician Avas not at once appeased. \" It is the first time in all these years that you have treated me so,\" he said reproachfully. \" Of course I know I have no right to be consulted as to your political designs, but there was a time when you would not have gone aAvay like that, Avithout even a Avord to let me know Avhere you Avere, and Avhen I might expect to see you again.\" Jealousy is sometimes the most grateful proof of affection. To Maximilian, at this moment, there was something consoling in his friend's complaint. He laid his hand Avith a caressing touch on the other's arm. \" I am sorry, Auguste, indeed,\" he said mildly. \" I admit I was wrong. I can only tell you that no one ever repented anything more than I have done this expedition. Would to God that I had had you by my side last night ! \" And he proceeded to give a brief sketch of his"], [234, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 222 adventures. When he came to the conversation Avith the man Avho had been intruded into his cell, the musician gave him a look of anxious inquiry. \"Yes,\" said Maximilian in answer to the unspoken question, lowering his voice to a Avhisper, \" I recognized him almost from the first minute. It Avas Doctor Krauss.\" \" Oh, Max, this is terrible ! \" exclaimed his friend. \" To think that they should dare do such a thing ! Have you any idea Avho it was that sent him there ? \" Maximilian shook his head. \" I can prove nothing,\" he said despairingly. \" I sus pect the Chancellor and Moritz. But even if I Avere sure, Avhat could I do ? The mere fact of their ventur ing on such a step Avould convince everybody that there Avere some grounds for it. And then the fact of my presence at the Socialist meeting \u2014 all AA-ould tell against me ! \" He broke off abruptly, struggled Avith his emotions for some feAV moments, then broke doAvn, and flung himself into his friend's arms, crying wildly \u2014 \" Auguste ! Stand by me ! I have no one I can trust but you ! \" The last reserve of Bernal appeared to give way before this appeal. He folded the King in an affec tionate embrace, Avhich seemed to give him greater con solation than any words. In a feAV minutes the fit passed off, and they were quietly discussing affairs in the Castle. It Avas thus that Maximilian learned to his astonish ment that Dorothea had been for the last three days a"], [235, "THE FIRST WARNING. 223 member of the Princess Hermengarde's suite. Maxi milian's royal instinct rose in arms at the idea that the Princess had dared to interfere in his affairs Avithout his permission, and he at once declared his resolve to go and demand an explanation of her conduct At the same time that Maximilian Avas holding this conversation Avith his friend, the Princess Avas giving secret audience to the Court physician himself. The Chancellor Avas also present. He had been careful to intercept the physician on his arrival at the Castle, and after hastily exchanging a few words Avith him, had conducted him by the back staircase into Hermengarde's presence. The restrained air Avith Avhich Von Sigismark saluted her Avarned the Princess immediately that some com munication had already passed between the two. She was quick to perceive that all was not going Avell Avith her projects, and almost involuntarily hardened her face into a frown as she composed herself to hear the specialist's report. Dr. Krauss proceeded, in as calm a manner as if he were discussing the case of an ordinary patient, with his friends, to describe the stratagem by which he had been mingled among the victims of the police raid and introduced into the King's presence. He added the information of the King's subsequent re lease and return to Neustadt by the same train as himself. Hermengarde found it difficult to conceal her agita tion as she listened to his narrative. \"And no doubt, sir, it is in consequence of your"], [236, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 224 observations that my nepheAV has been restored to freedom ? \" she remarked at the first pause. \" Yes, Madam. As a result of my conversation with him, during Avhich I believe no suspicion as to whom I was entered his mind, I have no hesitation in declaring that at present there is nothing in his Majesty's state of health which Avould justify any measures of restriction.\" Hermengarde breathed hard, and directed a searching glance at Von Sigismark. But the old Count's face Avore the look she had learned to dread, the sanctimoni ous1 uprightness of the loyal servant, tempered by the courtier's deference to the personage Avho held the station of aunt to the King. She turned again to the physician, speaking in a voice Avhich, do Avhat she Avould, sounded dry and con strained \u2014 \" I rejoice to hear that so far our Avorst fears are not justified. Have you detected any symptoms which indicated that there might be danger in the future?\" \" I cannot say I did, Madam. At present there is no trace of anything in his Majesty's condition Avhich might not be found in multitudes of persons Avho pass through life Avithout ever incurring the suspicion of unsoundness. Of course, I have to bear in mind the constitutional taint Avhich he has probably inherited, and which must always be a reason for care and Avatch fulness on the part of his friends. His Majesty has no doubt a highly nervous temperament. I Avill even go so far as to say that any very great stress of excitement, any great and sudden shock to the nerve centres, might produce derangement ; but there is no indication of"], [237, "THE FIRST WARNING. 225 anything of that sort at present ; and if his Majesty can be induced to use care and prudence it may never come at all.\" The Princess bent her eyes on the Chancellor Avith that strange expression Avhich he, on his side, had come to regard Avith inward disquietude. He endeavoured to feign unconsciousness of it as he observed \u2014 \" I am sure, Herr Doctor, that the Princess and myself are under a deep obligation to you for so fully setting our fears at rest. I agree Avith you in hoping confidently that no such crisis as you refer to may ever arise. Should there be any occasion to fear it we shall in any case have the advantage of your advice and services.\" The physician boAved and rose to leave the room, and the Chancellor imitated his movement. \" One moment, Count,\" said the Princess, lifting her hand. \" I have something I should like to say to you.\" \"As you please, Madam,\" he responded, hardly veiling his umvillingness. \" Perhaps, Doctor, you will be good enough to Avait on the stairs till I join you.\" Doctor Krauss signified his consent with a nod, and left them. The Count remained standing. Hermengarde gazed at him steadily for a feAV seconds. \" May I ask Avhat you propose to do now ? \" she in quired. \" Madam, my first task is to keep my head on my shoulders.

Then he turned to the Princess."], [239, "THE FIRST WARNING. 227 \" Aunt, will you allow me to have a Avord with you in private ? \" The Chancellor hastened to withdraw, only too pleased at the opportunity, and Ernest reluctantly followed him from the room.

But Hermengarde had been perfectly prepared for this inquiry, and did not alloAv herself to be discon certed by her nepheAv's rudeness. \" The Fraulein came here of her OAvn accord, Sire,\" she said, with cold dignity. \" Though, I admit, I was guilty of the offence of telling her that she Avould find a welcome Avith me, if she should ever Avant to leave her father's roof.

What do you mean, Madam ? Be careful Avhat you say.\" \" It is my habit to be careful of what I say, and of Avhat I do as well,\" was the retort, in which the King detected a subtle innuendo which made him shrink. \" But if you have not entire confidence in my words, I"], [240, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 228 should be glad to be allowed to send for the Fraulein herself, whom your Majesty will perhaps believe Avhen she tells you that she fled to me at midnight to escape from, as I understood her, the actual blows of this man Gitten.\" Maximilian Avas completely conquered. He rose to his feet, deeply agitated, and said \u2014 \"Aunt Hermengarde, I beg your forgiveness. I am much ashamed of myself to have judged your conduct so Avrongly. But I am hardly myself; certain things Avhich have happened lately have disturbed me very much.\" He paused, and glanced at her as if hesitating Avhether to take her into his confidence. But perhaps a subtle instinct Avarned him against such a step. The atmosphere of Courts breeds distrust ; and Avhom should a king distrust more than those Avho Avill prosit by his ceasing to wear the crown ? \" You have earned my gratitude,\" he observed finally. \"If there is anything I can do to repay you, you may command me at any time.\" \" I will only ask one favour,\" returned the Princess, Avith a smile. \" AHoav me to bring my friend Dorothea to Seidlingen.\" Maximilian smiled back. Had he not been in love, he might have suspected some underlying danger in this ready complaisance of the Princess. As it Avas, he thanked her without going further. His aunt added to the proofs of her good nature by begging him to excuse her for a feAV minutes, and sending in Dorothea to him as soon as she got outside."], [241, "THE FIRST WARNING. 229 And Maximilian shook off his cares, and began again to dream of happiness. In the mean time, Johann Mark had returned to the Castle alone. Unable to have access to the King, he Avandered out into the gardens, where he strolled moodily up and doAvn, revolving in his mind the events of the last twenty-four hours. In this occupation he was interrupted by Bernal, Avho had discovered him from a AvindoAV, and come out on purpose to have a conversation Avith him. Johann had not yet got over his first repugnance to the composer, and greeted his approach Avith a marked lack of cordiality. But Bernal was not to be rebuffed. He resolutely engaged Avith the Socialist, and quickly brought him to the subject Avhich Avas uppermost in his own mind. \" My friend King Maximilian seems to be a good deal harassed by what has been happening lately,\" he said. \" He has told me all about his adventures in Mannhausen.\" The republican frowned. \" I do not knoAv that there was much to tell,\" he retorted roughly. \" Of course, it was unpleasant for him to be arrested, but I should not think that need trouble him very much.\" \" It is not merely the arrest He has had a great deal of Avorry all along, ever since his attempt to introduce these neAv ideas.\" It seemed to Johann that he was being attacked. \" And Avhose fault is that ? \" he demanded. \" It is the Ministers Avho refuse to obey his orders and Avho raise"], [242, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 230 all kinds of obstacles to everything which the King wants done.\" \" I dare say they do ; I have no doubt they are very much to blame,\" returned the composer quietly. \" But I am not looking at the matter from a political point of vieAV, but as the King's personal friend ; and Avhen I see him Avorried and ill, I have a right to feel concerned. I have knoAvn the King longer than you have, and I know that he is of a very sensitive temperament, and ought not to be exposed to troubles of this kind.\" Johann's manner became still more hostile. \" I think, sir,\" he said with some bitterness, \" you have shown pretty plainly from the first that you have not much sympathy Avith the cause that the King has pledged himself to support. You no doubt Avould rather he continued to spend his time in building sumptuous palaces, and in listening to operas. But I believe that he has at last aAvakened to his real duty in life ; and no matter what it may cost him at first, I believe it is better for him to go on Avith his task than to sink back into the condition of a Sybarite, Avith no aim beyond his OAvn selfish pleasures.\" Bernal flushed under these severe remarks, but he resolutely kept his temper. \" All that may be so, Herr Mark,\" he replied ; \"at all events I am not going to dispute it with you. If King Maximilian Avere an ordinary man I should not say another Avord. But Avhat I Avant you to remember, Avhen you are urging him on to all kinds of violent measures, is this, that if you press things too far, if you"], [243, "THE FIRST WARNING. 231 harass him beyond a certain point, the result may be such as you little think of.\" Johann stared at him bewildered. \" Excuse me, sir, but I do not understand you.\" \"What I mean is this, that the King comes of a morbid stock. Up to the present he has been kept free from any great cause of agitation, and he has shoAvn no sign of the hereditary curse of his family ; but let there be too great a strain put upon him, let him receive one or two more shocks like last night, and I tremble for the effect upon his brain.\" Johann dreAV himself up, and an incredulous smile came upon his lips. \" So that is it ! \" he cried scornfully. \" As long as a King Avastes his substance and the hard-earned taxes of his subjects in any sort of frivolous pleasure and riot, he is perfectly sound and sane ; but the moment he begins to take an interest in the people, the moment he begins to make any practical attempt to better their lot, then, in your opinion, he is going mad ! Thank you for speaking so plainly. At last we understand each other. You had better go and tell your fears to some one who Avill be more ready to believe in them \u2014 the Chancellor, for instance. As far as I am concerned, I think that the King has at last become sane, after being mad all his life.\" And with this reply, the Socialist turned his back, and strode aAvay Avith a fierce air. While Bernal, deeply dejected, was still standing, as though in doubt Avhat course to pursue, he was accosted by Karl, who had come towards him from the palace."], [244, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 232 \" What is it ? Does the King want me ? \" \"No, sir; at least I have not been sent by his Majesty. The Princess Hermengarde commanded me to say that she hopes to have the pleasure of seeing you in her Royal Highness's apartments after dinner.\" Bernal felt, a slight shiver. \" Tell the Princess that I am much honoured by her invitation, and I shall be there.\""], [245, "233 CHAPTER XVII. THE COMING OF THE KAISER. And noAV for a time all other matters at Court fell into the background, and every mind Avas taken up Avith the preparations for the coming visit of the Kaiser. The character of the young man Avho at this time had only recently succeeded to the Imperial throne of Germany was still to some extent a matter of con jecture. It Avas knoAvn that Providence had endowed him Avith a very ample share of confidence in his own abilities, and belief in his OAvn prerogatives. It Avas very quickly discovered that these qualities in the young ruler were not tempered by any great measure of consideration for either the rights or the abilities of others. In his domestic relations he would have deserved great praise if he had been able occasionally to forget the character of the sovereign in that of the brother or son. As a Crown Prince he had suffered under the suspicion of having lent himself to an intrigue for the exclusion of his father from the throne ; and such rumours obtained more credence from a certain vein of extravagance which marked all his public"], [246, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 234 actions, and had led the irrepressible Von Stahlen to invent for him the name of \"The Barn-door Emperor.\" One of his first acts after his accession had been to dismiss, under circumstances of some harshness, a great statesman Avhose services to his country and to the Imperial family had been such as have hardly been equalled in modern history. The Kaiser's assumption of personal control over his Government had not been marked by any great new departure ; but Avhat was Avanting in deeds Avas more than made up in verbal declarations of the most imposing character. Short of requiring them to pay him divine honours, there seemed to be no limit to the claims Avhich their neAv Emperor made upon the submission of his astounded subjects. That absolute power over their fortunes and their lives Avhich the great Frederick earned by his achievements, and which he used with discreet moderation, Avas asserted by his untried descendant in harangues Avhich resounded over Europe. The doctrine of the Divine right of kings was revived in the nineteenth century, and the Kaiser might have exclaimed with Louis XIV., \" L'Etat, c'est moi!' The foundation on Avhich the Kaiser rested his edifice of despotic power Avas the military system. The army over Avhich he Avielded the supreme command Avas care fully indoctrinated by him Avith the spirit of an exclusive society, privileged above the rest of the community on condition of lending its implicit support to his personal authority. Regiments gave dinners in the Kaiser's honour, at Avhich he made speeches inviting them to look down upon their fellow subjects as beings of an"], [247, "THE COMING OF THE KAISER. 235 inferior order. Sentries shot down private citizens in cold blood, for fancied affronts, and were reAvarded by the personal congratulations of the Emperor. The Kaiser assumed the character of a military chieftain encamped Avith his folloAvers upon the German soil, like an invader in a conquered city. In territories like those of Franconia and the other states Avhich preserved a partial independence, it was the theory of the German constitution that the local monarch retained the control of his army in time of peace. But the Kaiser Avas accused of Avorking secretly to upset this system, and to gather the Avhole of the military poAver into his own hands. Considerable distrust had been aroused by these tactics, and an almost open breach existed betAveen the King of Wurtemburg and the Kaiser on this account, at the time of the long-talked-of visit to Maximilian. Kaisers, like more common persons, are not above killing tAvo birds Avith one stone, and it Avas knoAvn in the Chancelleries of the states concerned that the Kaiser's journey was prompted quite as much by his desire to overcome this hostility, as by his curiosity to view the Avonders of Seidlingen. Thither, to the famous scene of Maximilian's extra ordinary creation, the Avhole Franconian Court repaired in state to receive its august visitor. The King had sent on Bernal in advance, to see that his ideas had been completely carried out to the last detail ; and as soon as a favourable report was received Maximilian followed Avith the rest of the Court, and made his first formal entrance into his new domain."], [248, "236 A CROWN OF STRAW. The raihvay ended at a distance of eight miles from the Castle itself. From there the royal party were driven in carriages up the new road which Maximilian's engineers had constructed, past the fountains and Avaterfalls which had been artfully scattered along the route, and under the archway, guarded by cannon, Avhich gave access to the hidden valley. Exclamations of Avonder and delight burst from the lips of the courtiers as they rolled through the rocky gateway, and the full beauty of the fairyland Avithin burst upon their sight. The gardens, the strange trees, the flower-beds, the canals and aqueducts, the kiosks and gondolas, all combined to produce the illusion of a scene upon the stage, rather than a sober reality of Avaking life. The season of the year \u2014 it Avas early June \u2014 helped to shoAV off all the natural features at their best And the culminating point was reached Avhen the Castle itself came into view, built of dazzling marble, Avith every turret and pinnacle flashing in the sunshine, like a palace of silver built by genii at the command of the prince in some eastern tale. Here, in the midst of these splendours, the more serious business of life seemed out of place for a time, and the whole Court abandoned itself to enjoyment. The King moA'ed about Avith a lighter step, proud ofthe success of his Avork ; the Princess Hermengarde put on her most gracious demeanour ; and the Count von Sigismark, snatching time from the cares of office, mingled with the pleasant throng, and condescended to receive the raillery of Von Stahlen on his supposed exchange of the post of Chancellor of Franconia for that of Grand"], [249, "THE COMING OF THE KAISER. 237 Vizier of Seidlingen. Even the stern Johann forgot his jealousy of the King's \u00e6sthetic tastes, and yielded for a time to the fascination of his surroundings. As for Dorothea, she Avas completely carried away by all she saAv. Shaking off the sense of her strange position, Avith the elastic spirit of youth, she seemed to regain in the air of Seidlingen the gaiety and lightness of the old days Avhen Maximilian first came seeking her in the forest lodge. The King gave every moment he could spare to her society, and Avhen he Avas elsewhere, she roamed about the gardens under the protection of her cousin, Avhose harsh nature softened insensibly under the influence of the girl's SAveet temper. Nor Avas the young Prince Ernest behindhand in offering her his company. Whether in despair of obtaining the old Chancellor's support for her schemes, or actuated by some deeper motive, his mother had all at once ceased to thrust him into the arms of Gertrude von Sigismark, and the vain girl again found herself obliged to fall back on the homage of such lesser lights of the Court as the Von Stahlens and Von Hardenburgs. Deeply mortified at this second failure to retain a royal admirer, she set herself to fathom the nature of the intrigue betAveen her father and the Princess. Aided by the reluctant hints Avhich she had the art to extract from Herr Moritz, Avho came to and fro between Seidlingen and the capital, she Avas not long in reaching the conviction that her father was to blame for her present disappointment, and that it only rested with him to make her the future Queen of Franconia. The result Avas just 'such as Hermengarde had anticipated"], [250, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 238 all along : Gertrude became her secret ally, and per sistently urged the Chancellor to do everything in his power to conciliate the Princess. In the mean time nothing Avas seen outwardly but sports and pleasures. In the midst of this magnificent picnic the Kaiser arrived to glorify the festivities Avith his patronage. After King Maximilian had received him in state at the entrance of the demesne, and conducted him to the Castle, the two monarchs Avith their Chancellors retired to an inner room to hold a consultation on the political questions Avhich the Kaiser desired to discuss. As soon as the affairs of Wurtemburg and other minor matters Avere disposed of, the Emperor took Maximilian familiarly by the arm, and asked him to Avalk Avith him round the gardens. The King assented politely, and the tAvo sovereigns strolled out together, while Von Sigismark led the Imperial Chancellor, General von Bernerstauf, into his own apartments. At first the talk between King and Emperor turned upon the various objects which they Avere viewing, but by degrees it drifted round to more personal matters. The Kaiser inquired as to the truth of the reports which had reached him of the attempt on Maximilian's life, and in response Maximilian related almost exactly what had taken place, down to the release of Johann Mark by his orders, and his reception as a familiar guest in the palace. The Kaiser, who had contrived by some of his measures to incur the reproach of Socialism, from"], [251, "THE COMING OF THE KAISER. 239 old-fashioned statesmen, without having earned the confidence of the Socialists themselves, was not an un sympathetic listener to Maximilian's account. \" If I had been in your place I should have knocked the fellow doAvn first, and talked to him afterwards,\" he remarked, Avith the rough frankness Avhich he affected. \" But all the same, I am interested in your Herr Mark. Of course, the man ought to be hanged, but I don't blame you for listening to Avhat he had to say. I hold that in these days a king ought to be his own prime minister, and not suffer the dictation of a set of officials. I don't think much of that Chancellor of yours. The man is past his Avork ; Avhy don't you get rid of him and have a younger man, Avho under stands modern ideas?\" Maximilian was much pleased at receiving this measure of encouragement from so influential a quarter. \" I have been considering my position lately,\" he answered. \" Up to the present, as I dare say you know, I have not taken much interest in the practical Avork of government. But Herr Mark has convinced me that I ought, as you put it, to be my own prime minister. I do not Avant to treat Von Sigismark harshly, but I have certainly found him very much disposed to thwart me when I ask him to listen to any new vicavs. If it is not taking a liberty to make the suggestion, you would confer a great obligation on me by saying a feAV words to him privately Avhile you are here, just to show him that my ideas are not so unreasonable as he seems to suppose.\" \"I will,\" returned the Kaiser heartily, clapping his"], [252, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 240 brother monarch on the back. \" We reformers must stand by each other. I had just the same difficulty to fight Avith myself, AA'hen I first came to the throne, but I soon showed these people that I was not to be trifled Avith, and now they either obey me or \u2014 go.\" \"Mark himself is here in the Castle now. I thought perhaps you might be willing to see him, and give me the benefit of your judgment on some of his ideas.\" The Kaiser shook his head vigorously. \" No ! I never do. It is a mistake to loAver one's self to the level of these people. They only despise you for it, and hate you more in the end than if you had always held them at arm's length. Look at poor Alexander II. of Russia ; if he had not emancipated the serfs they Avould never have assassinated him.\" Maximilian was much struck by these observations. He began to perceive that this young monarch, of Avhose headstrong folly the Avhole world was talking, hid some real capacity beneath his extravagant de meanour. They were of much the same age, the Kaiser had reigned fewer years than himself, and yet hoAv much more had he learned of the art of governing men ! While the two rulers Avere thus exchanging con fidences, their Ministers Avere conversing Avith apparently equal cordiality, though Avith far less real sincerity. The German Chancellor, like his master, Avas keenly curious about the recent events at Neustadt, but the account he elicited from Von Sigismark Avas much more guarded than that given by Maximilian to the Kaiser. The old Count would not admit that there had been"], [253, "THE COMING OF THE KAISER. 241 any definite attempt on the King's life ; on the other hand, he spoke with unconcealed aversion of Johann and his influence over the King's mind. \"The man is a blatant demagogue of the most extreme type,\" he said vindictively. \" He aims at universal confiscation, and the abolition of monarchy and aristocracy \u2014 the Avhole French Revolution over again, in short. Since he has obtained the King's ear I am in a state of perpetual apprehension as to Avhat may happen next. Imagine the consequences, not merely to Franconia but to the whole Empire, if such a man is allowed to have his Avay ! \" \"What you say is indeed very serious,\" Avas the cautious response. The Imperial Minister stood in far too much aAve of his master to commit himself to any very definite expression of opinion without having the royal instructions. Von Sigismark Avas restrained by no such considera tion. He had come, in fact, to a point at Avhich boldness was the most prudent policy. \" It would be an immense relief to me,\" he observed, \" to knoAv that I had the Kaiser's approval in the stand which I have felt it necessary to make against this man's interference in the affairs of the government. My own master, of course, has never been a politician, and I am sure he Avould pay great attention to anything Avhich fell from his Imperial Majesty.\" \" I Avill take care that the Kaiser is informed of the situation,\" replied Von Bernerstauf. \" I knoAv that he has the highest regard both for King Maximilian and for yourself.\" n"], [254, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 242 \"The fact is that there is another reason for my desiring to be put in possession of the Kaiser's Avishes,\" went on the Count, lowering his voice, \" a reason of so delicate a nature that I hardly deem it consistent Avith my duty to mention it to any other ear but his Majesty's own. You will pardon my reserve, General ? \" The General nodded gravely, Avith the air of one who understands more than is expressed. \" Your caution does you honour, my dear Count. I wish to be informed of nothing Avhich the Emperor does not himself desire me to know. I will, if that is your meaning, endeavour to obtain for you a private audience of the Kaiser.\" \" Thank you, that is Avhat I desire,\" ansAvered Von Sigismark. And the tAvo Ministers passed on to topics of a lighter nature. Later in the day the Kaiser and his Chancellor Avere closeted together, and the latter repeated the purport of his conversation Avith the Franconian Minister. The Kaiser Avas at first disinclined to grant the audience requested. \" I do not think I ought to encourage this person to come to me behind his master's back,\" said he, with some haughtiness. \"Anything Avhich he has to say may be quite Avell said through you.\" \" As you please, Sire.\" The Kaiser's Ministers Avere trained not to criticize but to acquiesce. \" I know perfcctlyAvell that the King and his Chancellor do not quite hit it,\" Avent on the Kaiser, familiarly. \" I"], [255, "THE COMING OF THE KAISER. 243 have heard all about it from the King himself. It is all about this Socialist Avho has undertaken to teach them how to conduct the government. But it seems to me that the more they quarrel among themselves, the better for my authority. What do you say, Von Bernerstauf ? \" \" I agree entirely with your view, Sire, if I may say so respectfully. No doubt the alarm of Count von Sigis mark is very much exaggerated. Of course, there Avill be always time for your Majesty to step in if anything like a revolution should become imminent.\" \" I should like to see a revolution ! \" exclaimed the Kaiser Avith Avarmth. \" Do you know Avhat I should do ? March into Franconia Avith an army of a hundred thousand men, declare the dynasty suspended, and mediatize the kingdom. It Avould simply mean another Hanover added to my dominions.\" Von Bernerstauf assumed an expression of the most profound admiration. \" You foresee everything, Sire ! \" he cried, with an imitation of his master's o\\Arn bluffness. But the Kaiser quickly recalled himself from these visions of aggrandisement. \" Have you any idea, General, what the reason Avas which the Count Avas afraid to mention to you ? \" \" I have my suspicions, Sire. I have had the oppor tunity of conversing Avith other members of the Court, and from various circumstances I am led to think that possibly the Count has some fears for the King's sanity.\" \" Ah ! \""], [256, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 244 The Kaiser remained for the next feAV minutes plunged in profound thought. At last he raised his eyes to Von Bernerstauf's. \" In that case I will receive the Count. Go and bring him here immediately.\""], [257, "245 CHAPTER XVIII. THE STATE BALL. The Castle of Seidlingen Avas illuminated. Every Avindow flashed with light, and all the roofs and turrets Avere picked out in brilliant lines of fire. Through the conservatories and gardens, and along the winding Avatenvays, stretched the rows of many-coloured lamps ; the trees were hung with Chinese lanterns of the quaintest pattern, and out in the lake a large floating platform Avas moored, from Avhich every now and then a sheaf of golden rockets ascended to the sky. At the far end of the grounds, Avhere the mountain began to rise abruptly from the artificial level of the garden, an immense arch of fire shone out against the dark back ground of the forest, and displayed in burning letters a motto of welcome to the Kaiser. Within the Castle the dazzling display reached its height. A magnificent ball-room of dimensions large enough to afford space for a thousand persons was lavishly decorated with trophies of flags and weapons, mingled with flowers, and lit up by a double row of white wax candles running round the walls. On the"], [258, "246 A CROWN OF STRAW. floor, shining Avith its perfect polish, moved a gorgeous croAvd of all the highest personages in Maximilian's kingdom, together with many illustrious visitors from other parts of Germany, who had attended to do honour to the head of the Empire. A rope of vermilion velvet marked off the area reserved for royal personages, and Avithin this area the ball had been opened by a State quadrille, in Avhich the Kaiser Avas obliged by etiquette to take for his partner the Grand Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Avhile Maximilian led out the consort of the Hereditary Margrave of Anspach. The Princess Hermengarde fell to a Prince of the House of Prussia, a brother of the Kaiser's, and the Margrave completed the Imperial set Avith a Princess of another reigning family. As soon as these illustrious personages had gone through their dance, the velvet rope Avas removed, and the other guests were at liberty to take part in the Avaltz which succeeded. Maximilian seized the first oppor tunity to relinquish the Margravine to another partner and wandered doAvn the room in search of Dorothea. He found her Avith some difficulty, shyly ensconced in a corner at the loAver end of the ball-room, and at once requested her to join him in the Avaltz. Covered with confusion at being thus singled out before a croAvd of spectators, the young girl dreAV back, murmuring \u2014 \" Please do not ask me. Think of Avhat the people Avill say if we are seen together ! And besides, I am not fit to dance in such a company. I have never danced before in my life, except amongst children and servants.\""], [259, "THE STATE BALL. 247 But Maximilian Avould take no denial. Inspirited by the music and by the intoxication of the Avhole sur roundings, he felt himself able to brave public opinion. \" Now or never, Dorothea,\" he answered gaily. \" I am not ashamed of you \" \u2014 and, bending doAvn, he added in a Avhisper \u2014 \" my future Queen.\" Dorothea turned pale, but offered no further resistance. He led her out in triumph, and presently they were circling round the floor beneath the keen glances of a thousand eyes. MeanAvhile the Kaiser, out of courtesy to his host, had approached the Princess Hermengarde as soon as the quadrille Avas over, and invited her to become his partner in the next dance. Hermengarde accepted, and they took one turn round the floor. Then she pleaded fatigue, and the Kaiser conducted her to a couch at the top of the room. He sat down beside her, and presently the course of the dance brought Maximilian and his partner across their field of vieAV. \" Who is that girl with your nepheAV ? \" inquired the Kaiser, carelessly. Hermengarde gave him a look full of meaning. \" She is the daughter of one of the royal foresters,\" she answered. \"At present she occupies the position of my reader, but before very long she may be dancing within the velvet rope, Avith your Majesty for a partner.\" The Kaiser flushed angrily. \" I do not understand you, Madam ! \" \"Hush! We may be observed.\" And , the Princess"], [260, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 248 turned her head, as if occupied in watching the dancers. Then she leant over towards the Kaiser and whispered something in his ear. He started, but controlled himself instantly, and they continued to converse for some time. Maximilian danced on. And as he danced bright thoughts came crowding on him, and the spectres over shadoAving his path melted aAvay, and he felt himself again a King, happy in his youth and in his poAver, and needing only to croAvn his happiness, that greatest of all treasures, love that is returned. So, after the waltz Avas over, and^ the music of the orchestra Avas hushed for a brief space, he led out Dorothea into the open air beneath the lamp-lit avenues of blossom. His example was folloAved by others, and ere long quite half the croAvd had deserted the dancing floor, and Avere wandering in couples or in larger parties through the fairyland outside. Some of the boats Avere unmoored, and sent gliding along the peaceful Avaters of the canals, Avhile one party, still more daring, headed by the Prussian Prince, boldly launched upon the bosom of the lake in a yacht Avith silken sails, in Avhich they glided past the floating raft of fireAvorks, and up into the deep shadows of the forest. Maximilian did not stray very far. He brought Dorothea to a place where the lake formed a little natural bay, the edges of Avhich had been carpeted Avith a thick bank of sine Avhite sand specially brought from the coast of England. From this spot there Avas a vieAV right doAvn the lake to its farthest bend ; and as the palace lay behind them it was possible to indulge in a"], [261, "THE STATE BALL. 249 sense of isolation almost like that enjoyed by a Avanderer on some lonely seashore. Here a low seat had been constructed of wicker-work, under the shelter of a magnolia, upon the edge of the sand. To this the King brought Dorothea, and they sat down side by side in silence. Something Avarned the forester's daughter that the King had come there with her for some serious purpose. She tried to calm the beating of her heart by taking in the cool night air in long deep breaths. Maximilian, on his part, was at first too much agitated to speak. His whole being seemed to tremble in the grasp of an overmastering emotion, and it was as much as he could do to keep his very teeth from knocking together, in the violence of his agitation. They sat, and watched the merry party on board the yacht sail past, and disappear in the darkness Avhich overhung the distance of the Avaters. Then a great fountain of gold fire spouted upward as if out of the bosom of the lake, and fiery serpents darted and zigzagged across the face of the heavens. \" See,\" said Maximilian, speaking at length, in a low, dreamy voice, \" like the wonders which art has brought about in this once desolate valley are the wonders Avhich love works in the heart of man.\" Dorothea did not venture to make a reply. The young man continued \u2014 \"Till I found you, Dorothea, I had never loved a Avoman. When I Avas a boy I was too shy to seek their society, and as I greAV up I became accustomed to con sider them as creatures of a different nature, incapable"], [262, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 250 cf entering into my feelings, or sharing my mystic views of life. But when I came to the lodge that first day by accident, and saAv you, I realized for the first time that something Avas wanting in my life, and, as the days and Aveeks passed on, I discovered that what I had missed Avas worth more than all that I possessed, and that my life till then had been a gloomy Avilderness like this dark valley shut in among its lonely mountains. Dorothea, they say that our race is under a curse, that there is no member of the House of Astolf Avho may not sooner or later find himself stricken doAvn in the midst of his poAver and pleasures, and confined in a gloomy cell.

And I have sought to drown it in all sorts of distractions, and to Avithdraw myself from all strangers' eyes, and bury myself alone with one or two Avhom I could trust, and Avhere I could move about freely, Avithout feeling that there Avere eyes upon me Avhich AA'ere the eyes of spies, Avatching and Avaiting for the first indication to enable them to cast a net around me, and strangle me Avithout remorse. All that is Avhat I have borne, and am still bearing, and it has AA-eighed me doAvn, and made me unlike other men, so that I have sometimes feared that my fate Avould be like a prophecy fulfilling itself, and the very dread of madness Avould drive me mad. But to-night, under the influence of my love for you, I feel a different being, I know that I am strong enough to fight and overcome this haunting enemy, I know that I never shall be mad Avhile I love you, and you love me.\""], [263, "THE STATE BALL. 251 He stopped, too deeply moved to proceed. Dorothea drooped her golden head, like a buttercup filled Avith rain, and sighed softly to herself. Presently he regained calmness enough to go on. \" But, Dorothea, there is one thing greater than love, and that is truth. I am afraid \u2014 afraid to ask you if you love me. Oh, if you did, if you could tell me truly that you loved me, it Avould be better for me than if yonder lake Avere turned into silver, and yonder castle into gold, better than if all the kings and emperors of the earth came here to resign their crowns into my hand, better than if an enchanter's AA'and smote the earth to sleep, and bound the Avheels of time in fetters of light, and bade this hour last for ever ! \" Dorothea opened her lips like one Avho breathes Avith pain, but her voice froze in her throat. \"Yet believe me,\" Avent on Maximilian, in tones of exquisite tenderness, \"that I Avould not have you give me any false hopes. If you cannot yet make up your mind whether you love me, tell me so, and I will wait. But if you have made up your mind, and knoAv you can never love me, tell me that, and though I shall never cease to love you, I -will go aAvay and persecute you no more. Perhaps it will still be in my power to make you happy. Perhaps your nature can never really find itself at home in this life of Courts, but only in some quiet nook where you will be able to live the life from Avhich I selfishly dragged you, and Avhere in time you may come to forget that your peace was ever troubled by the love of mad King Maximilian.\" A large tear took shape in Dorothea's eye, and fell"], [264, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 252 heavily upon the arid surface of the sand. She turned and ansAvered her lover. \" You are too good to me, Sire \u2014 \" \"No, not that! After this hour you must call me Maximilian for the rest of our lives, Avhatever happens.\" \" Maximilian.\" The syllables flowed out with a soft cadence, like water falling upon silver Avires, and Maximilian learned for the first time to love his name, a name by Avhich his house preserved the memory of the gentle, dreaming Emperor, Albert Diirer's friend, the last representative of chivalry, he who more than any other summed up in himself that quaint and mystic Holy Roman Empire Avhich symbolized the union of the barbarian and the citizen, the marriage betAveen the North and the South, that Empire Avhich at its best Avas only a dream and an imagination, a long crusade in Avhich the rough feudal knighthood of the Teuton lands descended century after century across the Alpine barrier, Avarring vainly against that mighty necromantic power encamped upon the hills of Rome. \" Maximilian, it makes me sad to hear you speak like this, because I cannot make you any return. When you first came to me, and asked me to love you, I hardly knew Avhat love meant, and I thought that perhaps by trying I could render myself Avorthy of your love. And I have tried, believe me. But noAV I know more than I did then. I understand things better, and I know that though I might become your Avise, yet I should never be able to feel towards you as you do towards me.\""], [265, "THE STATE BALL. 253 She spoke hesitatingly, almost shamefacedly, yet there was that in her Avords which went to Maxi milian's heart. He caught his breath, and pressed his hand hard upon his bosom, as though he felt a sensible pang. \"Thank you, Dorothea.\" He in his turn lingered over the name as if it Avere some magic spell, the mere utterance of which had power to soothe his grief. \" I had no right to hope for any other answer. But do not regret having listened to me this once. It is a greater joy than you know to be allowed even to tell my love to you, though I tell it in vain. And your very presence has an influence over me, and gives me more courage to bear my lot Do not weep, my beloved ; but before I leave you, give me one kiss as a token to remember you by in the time to come.\" She tried to check her tears, and, forgetting everything but pity, she put her arm round the young man's neck and kissed him yearningly, like a child that would win forgiveness from those who love it. As she relaxed her embrace Maximilian hastily Avithdrew himself from it, and silently strode aAvay. Hardly had he gone a dozen paces, when he Avas encountered by Johann, moodily wandering apart, after a vain attempt to find his cousin. The King gave him a look of the deepest dejection. \" What is it ? \" exclaimed Johann, impulsively. \" Is anything wrong ? \" \" I may tell it to you,\" answered Maximilian, halting for a moment ; \" you are in the secret already. My dream is over ; I have learnt that Dorothea does not love me.\""], [266, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 254 \" But she will ! \" cried Johann, much disturbed. \"She is too young to knoAv her OAvn mind. She has not had time to get accustomed to this neAv life. Give her more.\" The King shook his head sadly. \" It is useless, my friend. She is not too young to love. I knoAv her too Avell to expect her to change. I will vex her no more.\" And he Avent on hastily. Johann stood frowning and looking after him. Then his own face suddenly flushed, and he dreAV a deep breath. He seemed to be labouring to subdue some disturbing emotion as he stepped forward in the direction from Avhich the King had just come. As he had anticipated, his path brought him straight to Dorothea, Avho Avas still sitting beside the little beach, and striving to check her sobs. She raised her head quickly at his approach, and a look of apprehension came into her eyes. Her cousin came to a stand in front of her, Avith the stern air of a judge about to rebuke an offender. \" Well,\" he said in a severe voice, \" I hope you realize Avhat you have done.\" \" Has the King told you ? \" she asked timidly. \" Yes ; he has told me that you have refused him \u2014 refused to become a queen, Avith the grandest opportu nities of playing a noble part in history that any Avoman ever had.\" \" But, Johann, I am not fit for such a position. It terrifies me. I do not Avant to play a grand part All I want is to be alloAved to go on living peacefully, away"], [267, "THE STATE BALL. 255 from all these plots and intrigues and revolutions. I wish the King had never seen me, and then I might still be in the old lodge, Avithout a care in the Avorld, except to milk the cow and get ready my father's meals.\" \" Dorothea ! You talk like a child. Are all the schemes to Avhich I have given up my life to be hampered and perhaps ruined by the obstinacy of a girl Avho cannot raise her mind above the level of the dairy ? \" \" But surely it is not my fault, Johann,\" she remon strated, Avith a little more spirit. \" I did not Avant the King to love me, and I never undertook to interfere in your schemes. I Avas happy before all this came about. Why should I be dragged into these affairs, Avhen I never Avished to be ? \" Johann did not condescend to answer this last question. \" I cannot understand you,\" he observed bitterly. \" I do not suppose there is another girl in the whole of Germany, from the Kaiser's sisters down, who Avould not be glad of the offer Avhich you have throAvn away. There must be some reason for it.\" \" There is a reason for it,\" returned Dorothea, begin ning to shoAV some resentment at her cousin's masterful tone. \"And Avhat is it?\" \" Simply that I do not love the King.\" \" Perhaps you love some one else,\" said Johann, in a tone of anger and dismay. A bright flush overspread Dorothea's cheeks. \" Perhaps I do,\" she retorted boldly, rising at the"], [268, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 256 same time from her seat, and making a movement to go. \"Ah! And have you any objection to tell me the name of this fortunate man ? \" \" Yes. I will never tell you ! \" cried Dorothea, wildly. \" And I will never speak to you again.\" She turned and ran rapidly off, Avhile Johann remained as if rooted to the ground, gazing after her Avith an expression of hopeless beAvilderment Meamvhile, Maximilian, his brow overcast, and his Avhole manner burdened Avith a melancholy too great to be concealed, had reappeared in the ball-room, Avhere the Kaiser and Hermengarde Avere just finishing a Avhispered conversation. \" I can Avell understand,\" the Princess Avas saying, \"that you did not attach much Aveight to the alarms of a Aveak-minded old man like the Chancellor ; and besides, as you have pointed out, political follies could be checked at any time. But a mesalliance Avould be a very different thing. We cannot afford to ha\\Te the royal caste contaminated by the intrusion of peasants.\" The Kaiser nodded earnestly. \"And there is this additional danger,\" pursued the Princess, \" that a freak of this kind might be carried out too secretly for any one to interfere before it Avas too late. It would cause me no surprise if my nephew Avere to Avalk into my apartments at any moment, and inform me that he had provided the Court Avith a Queen.\" \" That Avill never do ; that must be prevented at all costs,\" muttered the Kaiser. \" I Avas sure you would say so. The Avhole idea is"], [269, "THE STATE BALL. 257 insane,\" returned the Princess. \" Besides,\" she pursued artfully, \" Avhat we desire is to see our King allied with some great European House. Think Avhat an advantage it Avould be for Franconia if Ave could induce you to bestow one of your sisters upon the King ! I know that, Avere my son likely to ascend the throne, such a match Avould become my highest ambition for him.\" The Kaiser smiled shreAvdly, but made no reply. \"Then may I take it that you are prepared to sanction such steps as may be deemed necessary ? \" inquired the Princess, striving not to betray her agitation. \" Whatever the Privy Council of Franconia decides upon Avill receive my sanction,\" Avas the guarded answer. \" I will consult further Avith my Chancellor and Avith the Count von Sigismark, as to the proper course to be pursued, and cause a communication to be made to you.\" The Princess Avas compelled to be satisfied Avith this. She murmured her thanks, and the Kaiser rose, and Avalking down the ball-room, met Maximilian near the entrance. \" Where is your kinsman, the Count von Eisenheim ? \" he asked. \" How is it that I do not see him here ? \" \"He received an invitation,\" replied the King, abstractedly, \"but declined it on the plea of ill health. He has not been to Court for very many years.\" \" Indeed. Where does he live ? \" \"At the Castle of Eisenheim. You will pass it on your way back to Berlin.\" \"Ah ! Come out with me into the grounds. I should like to see the illuminations.\" And he drew the King aAvay. S"], [270, "258 CHAPTER XIX. A DECLARATION OF AVAR. The following morning the Kaiser, after a long con versation with General von Bernerstauf, sent for the Franconian Chancellor, and Avas closeted Avith him for nearly an hour. At the close of the intervieAv, AA-hich Avas kept secret from the whole Court, Von Sigismark took his way Avith a deeply anxious air to the Princess Hermengarde's apartments. Shortly aftenvards the departure of the Kaiser Avas announced. He Avas accompanied by Maximilian to the railway, but a visible change had come over his demeanour toAvards the King, and they parted on far less cordial terms than they had met on the day before. The next day or tAvo the Court Avas occupied in settling down after the festivities. Hermengarde noted, Avith some apprehension, that the King had ceased to pay open attention to Dorothea, and she Avent so far as to sound her delicately on the subject. But Dorothea, considering Maximilian's confidence as sacred, refused to say anything definite to her mistress about Avhat had passed."], [271, "A DECLARATION OF WAR. 259 Still she revealed enough to make the Princess fear for the success of her plans founded on the King's infatuation for Dorothea, and she consequently sent for the Chancellor time after time, and held long confer ences Avith him Avhich led to no immediate result Things might have remained in this position for some time, had not the catastrophe suddenly been brought on by the action of the reA'olutionary party in the capital. Emboldened by the release of all the prisoners arrested the previous Aveek, and by the rumours Avhich began to gain ground that the King had been induced by Johann to interfere in their favour, the leaders of the agitation suddenly issued a manifesto calling upon the whole of the Avorking classes throughout Franconia to hold simultaneous demonstrations in Mannhausen and all the other large towns of the kingdom, on a certain day, to demand various points in the Socialist pro gramme. The moment a copy of this manifesto Avas brought to the Minister of the Interior he set off in haste for Seidlingen, to lay it before the Chancellor. The electric Avire had already conveyed some intima tion to the Count ofthe events transpiringin Mannhausen, and Herr Moritz found his chief in a state of the utmost alarm and dejection. \"It has come at last,\" he said, \"as Ave might have anticipated. If we let this demonstration take place it is all over with the Government. These men are deliberately challenging us, and any appearance of weakness on our part will be the signal for open rebellion.\" \" I fear you are right,\" responded the younger Minister."], [272, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 260 \"I have reason to know that the state of seeling in Mannhausen is most dangerous. The laAV-abiding classes are fast becoming terrorized. They hear on all sides that the King is in sympathy Avith the revolu tionists, and they are losing all confidence in the pro tection of the Government.\" \" We must see the King at once,\" said the Chancellor, \" and insist on his authorizing us to prevent these meet ings by force. Failing that \" He hesitated and glanced at his colleague. \" Whatever action you may decide upon, Herr Count, you may rely upon my support,\" said the other, eagerly. \" I even think it right to let you knoAv that his Majesty has sounded me to ascertain if I should be willing to replace you in the Chancellorship, and that I informed him that I could not listen to any such proposals.\" The old Chancellor clenched his hands with rage. \" God in Heaven ! And this is the man Avhom I have been trying to save all this time ! That is how he repays my devotion, is it ! Come, it is time to act.\" And he led the Avay out of the room and towards the royal cabinet. At this very moment, as it happened, the King was engaged Avith Johann and Bernal in discussing the revolutionary manifesto. Johann had come, full of confidence, to enlist the King's sympathy for the demonstration, but had found his efforts strenuously, and even bitterly, opposed by Auguste, Avho insisted that the Socialists Avere not justified in seeking to force Maximilian's hand, and"], [273, "A DECLARATION OF WAR. 261 that it Avould be a fatal mistake on the King's part to appear to yield to violence. Maximilian, whose keenly sensitive nature Avas still smarting from the taunts to which he had listened at the Socialist meeting, considered himself bound in honouc not to offer any official resistance to the re volutionists. He listened to his friend's remonstrances at first with mildness, but finally became impatient, and closed the discussion by saying, in impatient tones \u2014 \" I have passed my word, and I cannot go back from it. If these men think they can help on their cause by such means better than by Avaiting for me to act, they are entitled to their opinion, and I have no right to Avithstand them. As Herr Mark told me that day in the gallery, I must either accomplish something myself, or stand aside for those who will. I have not succeeded in doing anything up to the present, and this is the natural result.\" \" I am sorry you take such a vieAv,\" responded the musician. \" I have given you my advice, the advice, not of a politician, but of a personal friend whose only aim is your own good. I hope you will not live to regret having refused to listen to me.\" And with these harsh Avords he Avent out of the cabinet, leaving Maximilian much distressed. Immedi ately afterwards the two Ministers were announced. \" Now we shall have a tough fight of it,\" remarked the King Avith a sigh, to Johann, \"but you will see I shall not give way.\" The Ministers Avere shown in, and respectfully greeted"], [274, "262 A CROWN OF STRAW. their master. Johann, the Chancellor noticed with a contemptuous nod ; his colleague, not at all. \" I think I knoAv A\\4iat you have come about, gentle men,\" said the King, trying to assume an air of cheerful indifference. For ansAver the old Count sloAvly unfolded the mani festo, and laid it in front of Maximilian. \"Yes, I have just been hearing about this. The Avorking men are going to hold some meetings to dis cuss the very topics which I put before you the last time Ave held a consultation. There is nothing very formidable in that.\" \" Pardon me, Sire,\" said the Chancellor, gravely, \" but my colleague and I regard it as most formidable. We regard it, and it is intended by the promoters to be regarded, as a declaration of war against your Govern ment. If successful it Avill be undoubtedly, as we are informed, followed up by an outbreak of armed rebellion.\" \" Oh, come, gentlemen, I think you take it too seriously. It will be time enough to deal Avith the armed rebellion Avhen it comes. This is simply a question of peaceful demonstrations, such as I under stand are permitted in every other country of Europe, except Russia.\" \" I greatly fear you have been misled as to the character of these meetings, Sire,\" answered the Count, with a hostile glance towards Johann, Avho sat listening Avith a confident smile which irritated the Minister beyond measure. \"My colleague here, Avho has this minute arrived from Mannhausen, tells me that the"], [275, "A DECLARATION OF WAR. 263 utmost terror prevails there, and the citizens are in daily expectation of a revolt. Your Majesty, I am certain, Avould not Avish to hear that your capital was in flames, and the dwellings of your loyal subjects given over to pillage by a ruffianly mob.\" Johann made an impatient movement The King checked him by a gesture full of dignity. \" Moderate your language, if you please, my lord Chancellor. I have already had to make that request to you once ; do not let me have to do so again. It is you who are really responsible for this manifesto. Had you lent a more willing ear to the proposals of Herr Mark, and alloAved it to be seen that my Govern ment Avas preparing measures for the removal of social grievances, we should never have heard of this. But you raised objections, you asked for delay, you assured me that there was no real discontent among the people ; and, as a consequence, these people have had to take action for themselves. And noAV,\" continued Maximilian, raising his voice, and speaking Avith a sternness which fairly cowed the old Chancellor \u2014 \" and now you come to me and tell me in effect that all your former assur ances were untrue, and that the capital is seething Avith discontent, and about to break out in open revolt against you. I cannot trust you, sir. You have misled me, and I will bolster you up no longer. If you have no better plan for meeting the just complaints of my subjects than breaking up peaceful meetings and cramming the gaols Avith prisoners \" \u2014 here he included Herr Moritz in an angry glance \u2014 \" then in Heaven's name let them rebel ! God helping me, I will not interfere. You may retire,\""], [276, "264 A CROWN OF STRAW. The two Ministers arose, pale and trembling, and Avithdrew Avithout a Avord. Johann advanced towards Maximilian. \" Sire, you are Avorthy to be a king ! I release you from your parole. Henceforth I trust you as I would myself.\" Once outside the door the Chancellor and his colleague stood still, gazing at each other in consternation. \" You are right,\" murmured Herr Moritz at length. \" It is time to act.\" \"And I Avill act,\" was the ansAver. \"Come this Avay.\" And he led his colleague into the presence of the Princess Hermengarde. As soon as she caught sight of their grave and anxious faces, Hermengarde kneAV that the decisive moment for Avhich she had so impatiently Avaited was come at last Concealing her gratification as decently as she could, she received the two Ministers graciously, and gave orders that no one should be admitted to interrupt their conference. Von Sigismark came directly to the point. \" We have come, Madam, under a sense of the heaviest responsibility to inform you that, in our opinion, his Majesty King Maximilian is no longer capable of governing. In the interests of the dynasty and of the Kingdom of Franconia it is necessary that his person should be put under restraint, and a Regent appointed to exercise the royal authority.\" This fatal declaration, thus formally conveyed in the cold official words of the Chancellor, affected the Princess"], [277, "A DECLARATION OF WAR. 265 like the touch of a block of ice. She trembled, and the full gravity of the situation rose before her mind. It Avas some little time before she answered \u2014 \" Your announcement does not take me by surprise. For some time past I have been reluctantly driven to the same conclusion. Though I regard my nephew Avith the most tender affection, I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that his conduct has not of late been that of a sane man.\" The two conspirators, who had been plotting with this end in vieAV for so long, exchanged these sentences Avith a lofty seriousness which seemed born of the crisis. It Avas as if they were conducting a solemn rehearsal for the benefit of an audience. It Avas the Count's turn to resume. \" Under these circumstances it becomes my duty to summon a secret meeting of the Privy Council of Franconia without delay, to take its instructions in the crisis, and I venture to ask your consent to appear before the Council in person, and acquaint it Avith your views, to Avhich the utmost Aveight will naturally be attached by the Councillors.\" The Princess interposed a question. \" You consider it necessary to call the Council together before adopting any measures Avith regard to the King's person ? \" \" Undoubtedly, Madam. In a matter of such terrible gravity I dare not act on my own responsibility. It is not as if there had been any violent outbreak of mania Avhich Avould justify Dr. Krauss in ordering the imme diate restraint of his Majesty.\""], [278, "266 A CROWN OF STRAW. \" I quite see your position. With reference to the Doctor \u2014 I suppose you will consult him before sum moning the Council?\" \" I must do so. It is indispensable that he should be brought to modify his views on the King's state of health. I understand that he is still secretly in the Castle.\" \"Yes. I requested him not to leave the Court for the present. Do you anticipate that it will be easy to induce him to change his opinion ? \" \" I do not doubt that you and I together, Madam, Avill be able to convince him that it is necessary for the public safety that he should.\" Hermengarde boAved silently, with a look Avhich showed that she understood the meaning underlying the Minister's words. \" In addition,\" he pursued, \" I have the written authority of the Kaiser for the step Avhich we propose to take. I ascertained from Dr. Krauss some time ag-o on the occasion Avhen Ave last consulted him, in fact, that the Kaiser's authority would have great AA'eight Avith him.\" The Princess looked much relieved. \" The Doctor's assistance will be the more necessary,\" said Herr Moritz, speaking for the first time, \" because Ave shall have to contend, of course, Avith the determined opposition of the King's personal intimates.\" Hermengarde looked at him Avith a slight touch of contempt. \"I should not have thought that the opposition of Herr Mark would have counted for very much,\" she remarked sarcastically."], [279, "A DECLARATION OF WAR. 267 \" I was thinking rather of Herr Bernal,\" replied the Minister. \" He is a man of great eminence, of a European reputation, in fact, and he might rouse public opinion in the King's favour to a dangerous extent. And there is also the confidential servant, Karl Fink.\" \" Fink can be bought,\" replied the Princess, calmly. \" He has been in my pay for a considerable time. And I do not think Herr Bernal's opposition will be quite so formidable as you expect. He has been greatly alienated by the King's sudden friendship for this new man ; and, in short, I think you may leave Herr Bernal in my hands.\" The tAvo men glanced at each other in astonishment. Hermengarde Avas flattered by the effect she had produced. \" But you have not told me,\" she resumed, turning to Von Sigismark, \" how you intend to deal with the question of the Regency.\" \" The ordinary course would be for the Regency to go to the heir of the throne, Prince Ernest Leopold. He being a minor, it will be the duty of the Privy Council to nominate a Regent till the Prince comes of age. I have no doubt that the choice will fall upon your Royal Highness.\" The Princess could not restrain a gratified smile. \" In that case I hope I shall be privileged to retain your assistance in the position you have filled so long and so ably. And I also trust that Herr Moritz will consent to give my Government the benefit of his high abilities.\""], [280, "268 A CROWN OF STRAW. Von Sigismark simply bowed. His colleague murmured a few Avords of thanks. \" But there is another matter, of a more personal nature, on Avhich I am anxious to arrive at an under standing Avith you, Count,\" the Princess Avas continuing, when she stopped, Avarned by a significant glance from the Chancellor. The latter turned to his subordinate. \"As Ave have finished dealing with State affairs, perhaps the Princess will allow you to Avithdraw to my room. I shall be Avith you in a very feAV minutes.\" Herr Moritz promptly retired, and the Count turned to Hermengarde. \" I thought you might possibly intend to mention some matter on Avhich I have not yet taken Herr Moritz into my confidence,\" he explained. \" I do not consult him about everything, though he is a very Avorthy man. I believe he is much attached to my daughter.\" Hermengarde gave a slight inclination of her head. She understood Avhy the younger Minister had been dismissed. \" Your discretion is perfect, my dear Chancellor,\" she said, falling into a more familiar tone. \" I Avas about to refer to your daughter. Since I last spoke to you on the subject my son has manifested a decided partiality for her, and I am inclined to think she is not quite indifferent to it. Supposing the arrangements Ave haA'e just been discussing are successfully carried out, is there any reason why Ave should stand in the Avay of these young people's happiness?\" It Avas the second time that the tempting suggestion"], [281, "A DECLARATION OF WAR. 269 had been held out to the old courtier. And this time he did not reject it. \"Madam, I should be unworthy of the great honour you do me if I pretended any longer that such an alliance would not be the greatest gratification to Avhich I could possibly aspire. My daughter's feelings are knoAvn to me, and I can only say that if the Prince should honour her Avith his hand he will find in her a Avise whose devotion to him may perhaps atone in some measure for her inferiority in rank.\" He kissed the Princess's hand Avith every demon stration of respect, and withdrew. \"At last,\" muttered Hermengarde to herself, as she rose and feverishly paced the room. \" At last the goal is within reach. All along I have felt a lurking distrust of that old man, but noAV, thanks to his daughter, I have conquered him, and my triumph is secure.\" The Chancellor took his Avay thoughtfully to his OAvn apartments. The part he had to play became more difficult at every moment. He Avas not blind to the secret of Herr Moritz's devotion to his interests, and he was not ill pleased to find his daughter bearing Moritz company Avhen he arrived on the scene. He even affected to joke with the young Minister on the subject. In truth, the old Count felt a real affection for his protege\", and, in spite of his plebeian origin, had secretly destined him for his OAvn successor in the Chancellorship. But all other projects had to yield for the present to the great business in hand. For some time the Chancellor hesitated Avhether to let his daughter into"], [282, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 270 the secret ; but finally, concluding that her ignorance of Avhat was going forward might lead to greater dangers than her knowledge, he decided to take her into his confidence. As soon as Herr Moritz had left them together, there fore, he proceeded to enlighten her. Although Gertrude had been aware that some serious intrigue Avas on foot betAveen the Princess Hermengarde and her father, she had never dreamt of the real issues involved, and Avas thunderstruck at learning that the King was to be declared mad. The first exclamation Avhich rose to her lips disconcerted her father \u2014 \" But he is no more mad than I am ! \" \" Hush ! He may not be mad in the sense that an ordinary person is said to be mad Avhen he believes that he is the Archangel Gabriel, or that his bones are made of glass. But the King's madness is far more dangerous. He believes that it is his duty to promote a bloody revolution in his OAvn kingdom. The Avelfare of five millions of people is at stake, and for their sakes he must be deprived of his tremendous power for harm.\" Gertrude did not require much convincing, and she listened greedily AA'hile her father repeated to her the offer of the Prince's hand. \" Do not build upon it overmuch,\" he Avarned her, in conclusion. \" The Princess is a dangerous and deceitful Avoman, and I do not trust her to the extent that she supposes. This offer is very probably a mere decoy, intended to secure my support in the matter of the Regency. Of course it is necessary that Ave should affect to believe in her good faith, but at the same time"], [283, "A DECLARATION OF WAR. 271 there is no need to alienate old friends whom Ave may be glad to fall back upon afterwards.\" He glanced at the chair which had just been occu pied by Herr Moritz, and Gertrude understood. That night a telegram arrived at Seidlingen directed to King Maximilian and marked \" Private.\" It Avas delivered unopened into the King's hands. He removed the envelope, and read the following message \u2014 \"Allow me to respectfully urge your Majesty to prohibit the Socialist demonstrations at once, or consequences will follow which it will be too late to avert. Your loving subject and kinsman, \" Friedrich von Eisenheim.\" It Avas the first time he had heard from the recluse since his accession to the throne."], [284, "272 CHAPTER XX. THE SECOND WARNING. \" My dear Dorothea, surely you are not the one person in the Court Avho has failed to observe the King's state of mind. I thought you had better opportunities than any of us for knoAving the truth.\" Dorothea shrank back and trembled, listing her eyes helplessly to the scornful face of the speaker. The bitter feelings of jealousy toAA'ards Dorothea which had been nursed in the breast of Gertrude von Sigismark for so long, had at last found utterance. Emboldened by the disclosure made to her by the Chancellor on the day before, to expect the momentary downfall of the King, to be folloAved by the dismissal from Court of her young rival, she no longer thought it Avorth while to place any restraint on her feelings, nor could she resist the pleasure of being the first to crush Dorothea Avith the news of her royal lover's fate. But Dorothea had no thoughts to give to the taunts of her enemy. Her Avhole mind was absorbed in anxiety on behalf of the King. \" I do not believe it ! \" she cried passionately. \" His"], [285, "THE SECOND WARNING. 273 Majesty is perfectly well. I will go and ask the Princess if what you say is true.\" And before the dismayed Gertrude could stop her, Dorothea, flushed and weeping, Avent in and fell on her knees before her mistress. \" What is the matter, my child ? \" inquired the Princess, her stern face relaxing Avith sympathy. \" Oh, Madam, is it true Avhat they are saying ? \" the girl faltered out. \"Do people really think that the King is going mad ?\" Hermengarde's face instantly grew black. \"Who has been telling you that?\" she demanded, so Avrathfully that Dorothea Avas frightened afresh. \" The Lady Gertrude von Sigismark said so,\" she responded, trembling. She did not add anything as to Gertrude's ill nature towards herself, but Hermengarde Avas quick to perceive Avhat had taken place. \"The vain, insolent minx!\" she muttered between her teeth. Then, speaking more gently, she replied to Dorothea \u2014 \" I am ashamed of Lady Gertrude. Her jealousy completely blinds her. You must pay no attention to Avhat she says. I have seen for some time that she Avas irritated at the friendship the King and I have shoAvn you, but I did not think she Avould dare to indulge her ill feeling in such a manner. What she has said is high treason, and I shall rebuke her severely for it, and so will the Chancellor. As for you, my dear child, depend on me. Whatever happens, always remember that Hermengarde of SchAverin-Strelitz is your friend, not T"], [286, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 274 because the King admires you, but in spite of it.\" She stooped to bestow a caress on the agitated girl, and then added, \"Now go, and tell the Lady Gertrude I desire her attendance immediately. And be careful not to breathe a Avord of this to any one else.\" She dismissed Dorothea, Avho found Gertrude outside and conveyed Hermengarde's message to her. Gertrude received the summons in silence, and sullenly proceeded into the presence of the Princess, feeling no slight dread as to her reception. Her dread Avas amply justified, and before she re-emerged she was made to feel that it Avould have been better for her to have bitten her tongue than made her ill-timed display of spite. But, as the Princess feared might be the case, the incident did not end there. A few hours after, Dorothea, Avandering in the gardens by herself, came upon Johann Mark. Her first impulse Avas to turn and avoid him, as she had done ever since their quarrel on the night of the ball ; but the next moment she made up her mind to sacrifice her own personal feelings in the interests of Maximilian. She therefore Avalked straight up to her cousin, and at once began \u2014 \"Cousin Johann, I have something very serious to tell you about the King. He is in danger.\" Johann had assumed an air of some severity on the first appearance of his cousin, which he altered into condescension on her coming up, as he thought, to make friends Avith him. But directly he heard what she had to say, all thoughts of their quarrel Avere forgotten."], [287, "THE SECOND WARNING. 275 \" What is it ? \" he cried anxiously. \" Do you mean the Socialist demonstrations ? \" \" No. I have not heard anything about Socialists. It is something far Avorse than that. Johann,\" her voice dropped to a Avhisper, \"tell me, have you ever heard it rumoured that the King Avas going mad ? \" He started back in alarm. The very suggestion Avhich had been made to him a short time before by Maximilian's most intimate friend and favourite ! Was it possible that Dorothea, too, had been infected by the base fear? \" Certainly not ! \" he exclaimed indignantly. \" He is as sane as any man in Germany. Do you mean to say that you have dared to suspect such a thing ? \" \" Oh no ! \" protested Dorothea, earnestly. \" Never for one instant have I thought of it. But \u2014 and that is why I wanted to consult you \u2014 I am afraid the King has enemies who think that his mind is giving Avay, and Avho reckon on his not being alloAved to reign much longer.\" Johann smote his breast. \"Infamous, infamous ! \" Avas all he could say at first \" But Avho are these enemies ? \" he added, turning quickly to his cousin. \" I do not know. I know nothing beyond the fact that some one spoke to me this morning, almost threaten ing me with Avhat I have said, as if it were certain to come to pass.\" \" Who was it that spoke to you ? \" \" I hardly knoAv whether I have a right to say.\" \" You must. For the King's sake, Dorothea ! \" \" Well, it was the Lady Gertrude von Sigismark.'"], [288, "276 A CROWN OF STRAW. \" Von Sigismark !

He pondered for a minute. \" I understand everything now,\" he said at length. \" You have done the greatest service in telling me this ; Heaven grant it may not be too late. This is evidently some plot to dethrone the King, because he has dared to take up the cause of the people. And I am responsible for this ! It is the result of my coming to Neustadt ! Well, I must save him ; that is all. There is not a moment to be lost. I will warn him at once, and as soon as I have put him on his guard, I will go to Mann hausen, and expose the Avhole plot to the people.\" Dorothea stood listening intently, her cheeks flushed Avith admiration for the young man's energy and resolu tion. He noticed her emotion, and a neAv thought occurred to him. \"But, Dorothea,\" he said inquiringly, \"surely you must have come to love the King at last, since you are so much concerned about him ? \" She dropped her head quickly. \" No, Johann. You do not understand me. I shall never love him. I Avish you would see that I am just what you are to him, a devoted friend, and nothing more. ' \" Then it is true,\" pursued her cousin, feeling his Avay delicately, \" that there is some one else ? \" \" Yes,\" said Dorothea, blushing, \" it is true.\" \" And do you still object to tell me avIio it is ? Dorothea looked at him gravely."], [289, "THE SECOND WARNING. 277 \" Some day perhaps I shall tell you,\" she said. And she turned hastily and ran away, leaving Johann Avith a sense of disappointment which he could not quite analyze, and Avhich continued to trouble him in the midst of his anxieties about the King. His first step Avas to return to the Palace, where he made his way straight to Maximilian's apartments. On the threshold he Avas met by Karl. \"Tell his Majesty I ask to see him immediately,\" he said abruptly. \" His Majesty has given strict orders that he is not to be disturbed by any one,\" Avas the glib ansAver. Johann stamped his foot \" Go at once, and tell his Majesty that I ask to see him on a matter of life and death.\" \" Wait here then, and I will try Avhat I can do.: Karl disappeared and Avas absent for a minute, during Avhich the republican impatiently paced the corridor. Karl returned, looking obstinate. \"His Majesty is very sorry, but he cannot possibly receive you.\" Johann darted a look at the minion Avhich made him quail. \"Go and tell the King that I demand an audience in the name of the people.\" \" I dare not\" Johann drew back and made a sign which the other had seen him make once before on a memorable occasion. He submitted at once. \" Well, I will try again ; but I Avarn you it will be useless.\""], [290, "278 A CROWN OF STRAW. He again went inside. After a somewhat longer absence he came back, and said stolidly \u2014 \" His Majesty cannot see you noAV. You can come later in the day.\" \" I Avill not wait. Go back, and tell his Majesty that one hour is Avorth his kingdom.\" Karl Avithdrew, shaking in every limb, and Johann Avaited, breathing hard, and with the SAveat breaking out on his forehead. When Karl came back this time he Avas no longer alone. Auguste Bernal accompanied him, looking pale and concerned. The composer drew Johann aside, and Avhispered in his ear \u2014 \" Herr Mark, I implore you not to come in to the King just now. He is extremely ill, so ill in fact that I fear the least excitement might produce a terrible paroxysm. You understand. I dare not let this be known to a soul except yourself.\" Johann's face became ghastly as he listened. He searched the other's face as if he Avould read his very heart ; but finally he boAved his head and Avent aAvay, Avith his limbs trembling beneath him. Hardly had the sound of his footsteps died aAvay when Maximilian's voice Avas heard from inside, sound ing calm as usual \u2014 \" Does any one Avant to see me, Auguste ? \" Bernal and Karl exchanged dark glances, and the former hastened back inside. Hermengarde's sentinels had done their work. Johann lost no more time. He hastened to the"], [291, "THE SECOND WARNING. 279 stable, ordered a horse to be saddled instantly on the King's business, and galloped off at full speed toAvards the distant raihvay station. As he dreAV up to the top of the hill which separated the enchanted valley from the outer Avorld, he saw a State carriage, drawn by four horses Avith postilions, drive rapidly through the archway Avhich guarded the royal demesne, and come SAvinging down past him towards the Castle. Hardly had he gained the gate way himself than another similar carriage dreAV up, a person closely Avrapped up leant out of the Avindow and gave a password to the officer in charge of the gate, and this carriage folloAved on after its predecessor. Behind, at a little distance, Johann could see a third carriage rolling SAviftly up the long road Avhich led from the station. He checked his horse under the archway, and asked Avith affected carelessness of the officer \u2014 \"Who Avas that man who spoke to you from the carriage ? \" The officer looked at Johann, and appeared to recog nize him. His position in the King's favour had hitherto naturally led to deference on the part of the underlings of the Court. But on this occasion the officer's manner Avas brusque almost to rudeness. \"That Avas the Privy Councillor von Layern, Herr Mark. Ride on, if you please ; I have no instructions to stop you.\" Johann started violently, and his horse gave a plunge. He pulled the rein to turn round. \" Stop ! \" cried the officer, noticing the action. \" I"], [292, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 280 have instructions to prevent your returning, unless you give me the password.\" And he deliberately drew a revolver. Johann gave a groan, and setting spurs to his horse, dashed madly on doAvn the road. As he did so the third carriage came up, halted a moment, and then rolled on beneath the froAvning gateway, and was lost to view. Johann had been seen to leave the Castle by Bernal. Satisfied that the coast Avas noAV clear, he repaired to the presence of the Princess Hermengarde, whom he found anxiously aAvaiting an intimation that the Privy Council Avas in session. As he entered her apartments, Prince Ernest went out, looking strangely disturbed. His mother had just taken the same step Avith regard to him which the Chancellor had been rash enough to take Avith regard to Gertrude. But Hermengarde had delayed imparting the secret till the last moment, and it was indispensable that her son's mind should be prepared before the conspiracy actually took effect. KnoAving his fondness for Maximilian, she dared not give the boy any idea of the motives which Avere really at work in her mind, but spoke to him as if his cousin's madness were a fact Avhich she had been forced reluc tantly to believe in by convincing medical testimony. Ernest received the terrible revelation Avith a strange passiveness. At first he seemed hardly to understand the full meaning of the disclosure. When he had taken it in he hung his head as if ashamed, and without offer ing any comment, stole out of his mother's presence."], [293, "THE SECOND WARNING. 281 Wearing a dazed surreptitious look, he Avent on through the rooms Avhich formed the Princess's quarter of the Castle, and calling his favourite dog to accompany him, made his Avay round by a back staircase to Maxi milian's apartments. Here he was interrupted, as Johann had been, by the vigilant Karl. But the Prince brushed him aside. \" I want to see my cousin,\" he said. \" I know all about it. My mother has just told me. I will see that you are not blamed.\" And Karl not daring to oppose physical resistance, the lad thrust his Avay past him into Maximilian's cabinet He found the King seated at a table, Avith a map of Franconia spread out before him, into Avhich he was sticking pins with various coloured heads. Maximilian looked up, and smiled pleasantly at his cousin's entrance. \" Why, Ernest, how is it that you have come in so quietly ? Surely there is some one outside ? \" \" Yes, Karl Fink is there ; but I told him to let me pass.\" The boy stared strangely at his cousin, and added naively, \"What are you doing Avith those pins ?\" Maximilian Avas rather amused by the lad's coolness. \" Look here, and I will shoAV you,\" he said. \" You see these pins with red heads ; they are to mark all the large towns and villages. The small blue pins show where there are railways running already, and these yelloAV ones I am using to mark out the routes Avhere I think there ought to be neAv railways made.\" \"But why?\""], [294, "282 A CROWN OF STRAW. \"Because I have found out that there are a lot of men in my kingdom Avho have no work to do, and I want to give them a chance of earning their bread, and at the same time benefiting the country at large by giving the farmers better means of sending their pro duce to the markets. You see, Ernest, a king ought not to spend all his time in enjoying himself, as I have been doing till lately ; he ought to study the Avants of his people, and care for them.\" The boy regarded him with a puzzled air. \" But is this really true ? \" he asked doubtfully. \"Are these things really for Avhat you say ? I thought perhaps they Avere only things to play Avith.\" Maximilian laughed. \" I see you have a very poor opinion of my character for business,\" he returned jestingly. \" But, unfortunately, I have found it does not do to be always playing ; and you Avill find that out, too, if you ever come to the throne.\" He stopped, and fidgeted for a moment under the boy's steady, disconcerting stare. His nerves seemed to be affected by some influence in the atmosphere, and he shivered slightly. \"Why do you look at me like that, Ernest?\" he demanded petulantly. The lad's expression became gravely sorrowful. \" Because I Avant to see Avhat it is like to be mad ! \""], [295, "283 CHAPTER XXI. THE BLOW FALLS. \" I AVANT to see Avhat it is like to be mad ! \" The Avords struck on Maximilian's ear like the grind ing crash of a collision upon the ear of the sailor sleeping peacefully in his berth, far out upon the Avaste of Avaters. He sprang to his feet, and confronted the young Prince Avith terrible eyes. \" What are you saying ? Who taught you that ? \" Ernest recoiled, terror-stricken. \" My mother told me of it,\" he blurted out helplessly, backing tOAA'ards the door to secure a refuge from the King's wrath. Maximilian struck furiously upon a gong. Karl rushed in, evidently in a state of alarm. \" Take this boy aAvay,\" said the King, fiercely ; \" and send me Bernal here at once, and Johann Mark.\" Karl darted off, accompanied by Ernest, Avho, in his hurry to escape from his cousin's presence, forgot to call his dog after him ; and Maximilian paced the room Avith frantic strides till the attendant returned. Auguste Avas Avith him."], [296, "284 A CROWN OF STRAW. \" Herr Mark has left the Castle,\" explained the agitated Karl. \" He took a horse from the stable an hour ago, saying that it Avas on your Majesty's service, and rode aAvay at a gallop.\" Maximilian tore at his hair. \"Traitor! He has deserted me in the hour of need, after working my ruin ! \" he cried in the first moment. But on reflection, he added, \" Perhaps he has gone to get help. We shall see.\" Bernal affected to be ignorant of the cause of the King's excitement \" Has anything happened ? \" he inquired. \" What is it that has disturbed you ? \" Maximilian glanced from his face to that of Karl, and back again. The musician was unable to meet his eye. Karl, better used to hypocrisy, displayed the most genuine tribulation. \" Auguste,\" said the King, speaking solemnly and mournfully, \" you remember what I told you of the night I passed in prison in Mannhausen. The conspirators have gone on Avith their work. My aunt has joined them, and I have just learnt from Ernest that they are openly declaring me\" \u2014 it required an effort to bring out the word \u2014 \" mad. I adjure you,\" he added beseechingly, \" in the name of our sacred friendship, to tell me Avhether you had any inkling of this ?\" The man thus addressed shifted his position uneasily, and cast down his eyes. \" I have had certain fears,\" he said, in low, indistinct tones, \"that if you drove the Ministers too far, they Avould succeed in convincing the public that you ought"], [297, "THE BLOW FALLS. 285 not to be entrusted with the royal power. No doubt your refusal to proclaim these Avretched meetings has been the last straw.

Sir, never dare to address me again in the name you have used. Henceforth to you I am the King of Franconia \u2014 and a stranger. You will leave my Palace to-morrow, and you may take with you the thirty pieces of silver you have earned.\" Without attempting a reply, Bernal turned and went out of the King's presence. Maximilian turned to Karl. \" And you, Karl, Avhy should you be faithful to me ? All my friends have betrayed me ; Avhy do not you go and join them ? Doubtless you will be reAvarded well.\" Stricken to the heart, the wretched attendant fell on his knees before his master, and began to sob. \" See,\" said Maximilian, speaking aloud as if to some Avitness of the scene, \" this poor youth, on Avhom I have bestoAved neither titles nor honours, Avhom I simply fed from day to day, and treated as some creature of a loAver nature, he clings to me when all my friends and my Ministers, and my very kinsmen, have cast me off.

Karl, if I survive this day as King of Franconia,"], [298, "286 A CROWN OF STRAW. you shall be made a Count ; and I will bestoAv upon you the motto, ' Only true.' \" The miserable Karl cast himself grovelling at full length upon the floor. \"No, no,\" said Maximilian, raising him gently, \"do not distress yourself so much for me, Karl. I have been a kind master to you, have I not ? \u2014 but you have served me well. You, at least, have nothing to reproach yourself Avith. Come, let us act. I will knoAv the Avorst at once. Go instantly to the Chancellor, and tell him I command his presence without a moment's delay.\" Karl boAved his head, unable to speak, and fled from the room. The King Avalked to an iron cupboard in a corner of the cabinet, unlocked it, and took out a golden circlet, Avhich represented the croAvn of Franconia on all occa sions except the coronation ceremony itself. He placed the diadem upon his head, closed the cupboard, and seated himself at the head of the table, on which the map, Avith its parti-coloured pins, was still spread. There he sat silently, aAvaiting his doom. Maximilian's agony Avas not of long duration. The tramp of many feet Avas heard in the ante-room, the door swung back, and the Chancellor von Sigismark entered, clad in his official robes, and bearing in his hands a great parchment scroll, blazoned Avith the arms of the State, from the foot of which SAVung, by a silken cord, a huge round of Avax stamped by the Great Seal of the Franconian kingdom. After him filed in, in solemn procession, nearly the Avhole of the members of the Privy Council, the only"], [299, "THE BLOW FALLS. 287 notable absentee being the Count von Eisenheim, the distant kinsman of the king. The other Ministers and high officers of State folloAved ; and in the rear stole the Princess Hermengarde, Avith Auguste Bernal and a third figure Avhose presence destroyed the last doubt in Maximilian's breast as to his fate \u2014 the sombre-coated Court physician. \" On your allegiance,\" exclaimed the King, as the party filed in before him, \" I order every one except the Chancellor to retire.\" Not a soul obeyed. All cast looks at the young monarch, in Avhich he read pity or horror. Without Avaiting, the Count proceeded to read from the parch ment in his hands. \" Whereas it has pleased Almighty God,\" the docu ment began, \" to afflict his Majesty, Maximilian Charles Leopold Joseph Marie von Astolf, King of Franconia, Grand Duke of Thuringia and Swabia, Prince of Astolf, Marquis of Este and Ferrara, Count of Lech, Meyer, and Ratisbon, Lord of Hohenlingen, Lord of Sturn, Lord of Neustadt, Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece, etc., etc., Avith unsoundness of mind : Now we, the members of the Privy Council of Franconia, having received and considered the testimony of Her man Krauss, doctor of medicine, physician to his said Majesty, and of her Royal Highness, Hermengarde of Schwerin-Strelitz, Princess of Franconia, aunt to his Majesty, and of the illustrious Count von Sigismark, Chancellor of Franconia, and of Herr Paul Moritz, Minister of the Interior, Herr Auguste Bernal, his"], [300, "288 A CROWN OF STRAW.

Done by the Privy Council at Seid lingen this fifth day of June, 18 \u2014 \" Wilhelm von Sigismark, Chancellor. \" Christian Silbur, Clerk.\" The reading of this act was received in absolute silence, except when the Chancellor came to the name Karl Fink, when the King uttered a stifled cry, and glanced over the throng in search of his attendant. But Karl had slunk away, unable to endure the ex posure of his baseness. The Chancellor, Avith several others of the Council, had anticipated a fearful explosion on the part of their victim, and a body of guards had been ordered into the ante-room, in case of any forcible resistance. But their apprehensions were disappointed. As the Count folded up his parchment, a strange, baffled, hunted look spread over the King's features. He gazed at the array ot"], [301, "THE BLOW FALLS. 289 countenances before him with a sickly smile for one moment, and then, bursting into a vacant laugh, leant back in his chair, and exclaimed \u2014 \"Wolf! Wolf! Won't some one bring Wolf to me?\" The dog, which had been left behind by Prince Ernest, crept forward at the sound of its name, and licked the King's hand. While these events Avere passing in the Castle of Seidlingen, Johann was approaching the capital as fast as the train could carry him. On his arrival at Mannhausen, the first sound that struck upon his ear as he emerged from the station was the voice of a neAvsboy shouting out the deposition of the King. The telegraph had been quicker than the train. Without giving a moment to rest or refreshment, he sprang into a carriage, and drove off to the house of his old friend and comrade, Schwartz, the man with the red beard. Scrnvartz was completely taken by surprise at his appearance. Indeed, his manner was so em barrassed that if Johann's mind had been free to take in anything but the fate of the King, he must have perceived that something was wrong. \" I have come here straight from Seidlingen,\" he burst out, without waiting for Schwartz, \" to rouse the revolutionary party on behalf of King Maximilian. He is the victim of a vile plot, solely on account of his sympathy Avith us. They are scheming to depose him as a madman, though he is no more insane than you are.\" u"], [302, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 290 Schwartz listened coldly. \" I Avas just about to go to a meeting of the revolu tionary committee,\" he said. \" You had better come with me.\" Johann eagerly assented, and as they Avalked along, poured into his companion's ear the history of the last few Aveeks. Schwartz heard him Avithout vouchsafing any reply. The two men seemed to have exchanged natures. Still Johann suspected nothing. The Committee was assembled in a small private meeting-place when they arrived. The chair was vacant, and Schwartz at once Avalked up to the head of the room, and occupied it, leaving Johann by the door. The sullen hostile looks of those present Avere the first signs that roused the intruder to a sense of Avhat Avas coming. \"The first business before us,\" calmly announced SchAvartz, as soon as he had placed himself in the chair, \" is the reading of the minutes of our last meeting.\" A sensation made itself felt through the gathering, and all eyes were directed towards Johann as the secretary proceeded to read in a cold, metallic voice. This was the last item in the minutes \u2014 \" Moved by Comrade Meyerbeer, seconded by Comrade Hirst, and carried unanimously, that Johann Mark be expelled from all further connection Avith the revolu tionary movement, as a friend and favourer of monarchy.\" The republican reeled beneath the bloAv. His first impulse Avas to rush from the meeting. But before the"], [303, "THE BLOW FALLS. 291 chairman could affix his signature to the fatal page, he gathered himself together, and strode proudly up the room. \" You have condemned me in my absence,\" he cried, sternly. \" Will you give me a hearing now ? \" The chairman, after consulting his comrades with a glance, boAAred his head in token of consent, and Johann, seizing the permission, launched forth into a full state ment of all that had happened since his first meeting Avith King Maximilian. He Avound up his harangue by reiterating Avhat he had already told Sclnvartz as to the true nature of the conspiracy against the King, and implored those present to banish prejudice from their minds, and come to the rescue of one Avho Avas about to fall in their cause. The meeting heard him out in perfect silence. Schwartz took it upon himself to reply. \" Johann Mark,\" he said gravely, \" Ave have been friends for years, and it goes to my heart to have to cast you off. But the cause is more sacred than friend ship. We believe you to be sincere ; we do not con demn you, as we might, to the penalties of a traitor ; but you have gone over to the enemy, and henceforth there can be no more comradeship between you and us.\" Johann stamped his foot, \" I know you,\" he exclaimed bitterly. \" You talk of liberty and brotherhood, and yet you calmly stand by and see the sacrifice of the only king Avho ever shoAved him self ready to serve the cause of liberty and brotherhood. What are your real motives ? Not love of the principles"], [304, "A CROWN OF STRAW, 292 you proclaim so loudly ! Not love of the people ! But blind hatred for a name.\" \" Stop ! \" It was Schwartz Avho raised his voice harshly over the angry murmur arising in the hall. \" If you have been blinded and deceived, we have not I know these Astolfs ; I know this race of vipers. My daughter and her child Avere foully done to death by the father of this Maximilian ; their blood cries out for vengeance ; and rather than stir one inch to save him from his fate, I sAvear to you that if he Avere here at this moment, I Avould strangle him Avith my OAvn hands ! \" A dreadful silence followed the dreadful oath. Johann, sick to his Arery heart, sank his head upon his breast, and Avent aAvay out of the company, and out of their com munion for ever. Henceforth he had nothing more to do in Mann hausen. If the King Avere to be delivered, it must be by his unaided efforts. He took his way back to the raihvay station at AA'hich he had so recently arrived, and as he Avalked along he saAv, staring at him from every Avail and hoarding, a proclamation prohibiting the revolutionary demonstration on pain of treason, and signed in the name of Hermengarde, Regent of Franconia. The folloAving Sunday, armed troops patrolled the streets of Mannhausen, and of all the principal tOAvns in Franconia. In some places the proposed demonstra tions Avere abandoned altogether. In others, the revolutionists gathered, only to be charged, ridden down, and bayonetted by the soldiery. Many were"], [305, "THE BLOW FALLS. 293 killed, hundreds Avere taken and thrown into prison, there to aAvait the sternest penalties of the law. The whole revolutionary movement Avas extinguished as if by a breath, and the Regent's Government received the applause of the civilized Avorld."], [306, "294 CHAPTER XXII. A ROYAL MADMAN. The Regent Hermengarde sat in her former apartments giving audience to Karl Fink. She had not transferred herself to the royal suite, as Maximilian still occupied it, under the guardianship of Doctor Krauss and Karl himself, pending her decision as to his future place of confinement. The demeanour of the attendant showed that his communication to the Princess had been ofthe gravest nature. His mistress, hoAvever, maintained her cus tomary frigid calmness. \" You Avere perfectly right to acquaint me Avith this,\" she AAras saying, \" but on no account must you mention it to any one else, not even to the physician.

It will be my care to find you another post where your merits will be rewarded.\""], [307, "A ROYAL MADMAN. 295 Karl bowed, Avith a shudder Avhich he was unable to conceal from the searching eyes of the Princess, and silently Avithdrew. Hermengarde gave a deep breath and looked as if some care had been removed from her mind. Then she turned to a private Avriting-table and proceeded slowly to compose a letter to the Kaiser. Several days had elapsed since the overthroAv of the King. During this time she had been busily employed. In the course of some of her numerous intervieAvs with the Count von Sigismark, he had presumed to refer in guarded terms to the coming betrothal between Prince Ernest and his daughter. Hermengarde, however, had met these allusions by insisting on the impropriety of pressing on the affair Avhile Maximilian's misfortune Avas still fresh in the public mind, and the Chancellor had appeared satisfied. Neither of them had ventured into the presence of their victim since his deposition from power. Hermengarde received daily reports as to his condition from Karl, and the Chancellor from Doctor Krauss. The Privy Councillors had not yet left the Castle. But there Avas one thing of which Karl had failed to inform his dreaded mistress. That very morning, as he was strolling by himself in a lonely part of those beautiful grounds in Avhich Maximilian had looked forward to enjoying so much happiness, a figure suddenly glided out from behind a tree, and stood before him. It was Johann. The ex-conspirator had succeeded in evading the numerous sentries, and, making his way into the valley"], [308, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 296 by night, over the mountains, had been lurking Mn the neighbourhood till he could obtain an opportunity of accosting Karl alone. Ignorant of his recent expulsion from the secret society, Karl still dreaded him one degree more than the Princess, and dared not refuse his demand to be privately admitted to the presence of the imprisoned King. As soon as night had fallen he let in Johann by a secret postern, which had been designed by Maximilian for his oavii use, and ushered him Avith every precaution into the royal cabinet. The sight of the change Avhich had passed over the young man Avhom he had last seen in the pride of health and beauty, the cynosure of an attentive court, struck Johann to the heart. He rushed fonvard and fell on his knees for the first time before the discrowned monarch. \" My King ! My royal master ! Look at me ; it is I, your faithful Johann Mark.\" Maximilian thrust aside a mass of grey tangled locks, and turned a dull gaze upon the man Avhose voice had reached his ears. \" Ah ! \" he said, \" it is you. I Avondered Avhere you were. Go to my aunt, the Princess Regent ; she will take you into her favour like the rest.\" \"No, no, Sire. Do not speak to me like that Do not think me a traitor.

Disguise yourself and come Avith me, and Ave will make our Avay to some distant land where your enemies cannot reach you.\" The King gravely shook his head. \" No. You do not understand. Have they not told you ? I am mad. Where can a madman find refuge ? I am better here \u2014 here among my faithful friends.\" Johann rose to his feet, his eyes flashing indignantly. \" I do not believe it, Sire ! You are not mad, or if you are, then so am I too, and I will share your fate.\" Maximilian also rose, and touched Johann Avith his finger, as if to assure himself that he was there in flesh and blood. Then he smiled mirthlessly. \" Why, no, my friend, you are right, I am not really mad. But you see that they all think so.

I can escape when I like, you see.\" \" But there is no boat there,\" said Johann, trying to give the best meaning to his master's words. \" I do not Avant a boat, Johann,\" was the reply. \" They Avould see me if I escaped from them in a boat, and folloAv after and bring me back again. When I escape it will be by a Avay so secret that all their spies Avill not be able to track me, and all their guards will not be able to bring me back.\" A long silence folloAved. Johann began to try and form some fresh plan by Avhich to aid his unhappy master. Presently the King's manner changed, his form seemed to collapse, he AvithdreAV his arm and crept back to the chair on Avhich he had been sitting before. Johann followed him respectfully. \" Is there anything I can do for your Majesty to-night before I leave you for a short time ? \" he asked. \" I want to see my cousin Ernest,\" Avas the response muttered in sullen tones. \" They will not let me see Ernest, though he is my heir.\" \" Your wishes shall be obeyed, Sire.

You Avill find him very gentle, but he is unhappy. Try to soothe him.\" With these Avords he pushed the Prince inside, and folloAved Karl to the private outlet. As soon as Ernest found himself in his cousin's presence, he uttered a cry of astonishment. Maximilian had employed the half hour which had just elapsed in attiring himself in the complete trappings of his royal station. He had put on the ermine robe, thrown the collar of the Golden Fleece around his shoulders, girded on the swrord of state, and grasped the"], [312, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 300 golden sceptre in his hand. In this pomp he received his young kinsman. Overawed by this extraordinary display, the Prince was about to fall on one knee before his cousin, as he had been accustomed to do on occasions of great cere mony. Maximilian checked him. \" Do not pay homage to me, Ernest,\" he said sadly. \"No one does that now. I shall not be King much longer. I have sent for you to tell you that. You are my heir, and Avhen I am gone you will wear these ornaments, and sit on the throne of Franconia.\" \" Oh, Cousin Max ! I cannot bear it ! \" And the poor boy began to weep. \"You need not cry, Ernest. You cannot help me. You have not plotted against me, and bribed my friends and servants. You have not spent the moments Avhen my head lay on your breast in calculating how to betray me. You have not Avatched me from day to day, for something which you might seize upon to carry to my enemies as a symptom of insanity. If you gave me food I should not spit it out again in secret, for fear it might be poisoned ! \" The boy's eyes greAv large with horror. \" What do you mean ? Poison ! \" he cried. \" Yes ; but have no fear, they will not poison you. But Avhen you are King, Ernest, do not forget your people. That is a crime for Avhich you will deserve to be punished as I am. Rule them, Ernest, but rule them yourself; let no ministers come between you and them, and usurp your power from you. Govern them justly but kindly ; if they make complaints, listen to them ;"], [313, "A ROYAL MADMAN. 301 if they have just grievances, redress them.

Study their problems, find out their needs beforehand. Above all, love them, Ernest, and they will love you, and no traitors will ever dare to conspire against your throne, and tear your crown from you like this.\" He Avrenched the diadem roughly from his head and made as if to cast it on the floor. But a new impulse suddenly coming to SAvay his mind, he strode up to Avhere his young cousin stood trembling and speech less. \"Take it, it is yours. See, I crown you, Ernest V. of Franconia ! \" And he thrust the circlet forcibly down upon the lad's broAV. \"No! No! Take it away!\" cried Ernest, wildly. \" It hurts me.\" \"Why, so it should,\" returned Maximilian grimly. \" Did you think crowns were pleasant things to wear ? It will hurt you more presently, Ernest, it will groAV red-hot, and sear a mark upon your forehead that will never wear away.\" \"You frighten me! I do not know what all this means. I feel something inside me, as if my head Avould burst.\" \"Why, there again, that is one of the symptoms,"], [314, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 302 Ernest You are an Astolf, too, poor child, your mother forgets that. But you must have these other things as well. The crown is not enough.\" And Avith the excitement mounting in his brain, the King tore off collar and robe and sword-belt, and thrust them almost by force upon the resisting boy. He finished by placing the sceptre in his hand, and then knelt doAvn upon one knee before him. \" Hail, your Majesty ! Noav go and show your subjects their new King ! \" \"Max, Cousin Max, I feel ill ; something is the matter in my head. Am I going mad ? \" \"Mad? Why not, Ernest? We are all mad, we Astolfs. It is in the blood. We inherit it Avith our kingdom. My father died mad, so did yours. What matter ; they have not found you out yet, as they did me. Hide it, Ernest, be cunning, cringe to that old fox Von Sigismark, marry his vain daughter, and he will never pull you down.\" The boy gave a wild laugh. \"Gertrude! I hate her ! They shall never make me marry her. I Avould rather go mad than do that.\" Maximilian laughed too, and clapped his hands, \" It Avorks, it Avorks ! \" he cried frantically. \" The poison in the crown Avorks, I kneAV it Avould ! \" Suddenly the Avildness left him, he crouched down shuddering, and raised a finger to his lips. \" Hush ! I hear some one. It is the doctor. Be careful ; Ave must try and deceive him.\" And he shrank down again in his seat. The door was opened, and Dr. Krauss came in. He"], [315, "A ROYAL MADMAN. 303 glanced round, and his eyes fell upon the young Prince in his strange masquerade. He turned sternly to the King. \"What do you mean by this, Sire? These things must be taken from you if you play such tricks. Be good enough to take them off, your Royal Highness,\" he added, speaking to Ernest, \" and come back to your apartments.\" And after helping the dazed lad to rid himself of the royal insignia, he took him by the hand and led him out. The King Avalked towards the Avindow."], [316, "304 CHAPTER XXIII. HERMENGARDE'S TRIUMPH. As the door of the cabinet closed, leaving Maximilian by himself, Avith the ensigns of his monarchy streAved upon the table and the floor, the clock of the Castle began to strike ten. Before the notes had finished, a solitary horseman came riding swiftly doAvn the road Avhich formed the main approach to the Castle. He had come through the guarded gateway on the crest of the hill Avithout a check, all the sentinels having presented arms as he Avent silently past them at full speed. He pulled up his reeking horse at the steps leading up into the Castle, and dismounted alone. At this moment a loud splash Avas heard in the lake, followed by a solitary cry. Immediately the great doors Avere opened Avith a clang, and a croAvd of servants and guards came running out, Avith torches in their hands, and shouting confused directions to each other. They streamed down to the margin of the Avater, the lights tossing above their heads like banners as they Avent Here they scattered, some searching up and down the edges of the lake, while"], [317, "HERMENGARDE'S TRIUMPH. 305 others tumbled hastily into the boats Avhich lay moored along the marble quay, and pushed themselves off from the shore. The torches gleamed fitfully, first in the air and then in the dark mirror of the Avater, as the boats glided to and fro, Avith a noise of oars, and every now and then a muttered direction from men standing up in the bows. Over all toAvered the high wall of the Castle, its lighted AvindoAvs showing out brilliantly against the gloom of the night. And the casement of one Avindow Avas open, and flapped sloAvly overhead, like the wing of some huge bird of prey, and moaned. Finally, there Avas a subdued shout, the wandering lights on the Avater gathered together in an aAvfully narroAV ring about one point, and one of the boats tilted slightly, as some Aveight was slowly dragged in over the side. Then the boats came back, rowing heavily to the shore, and from the foremost boat a burden Avas lifted, and laid Avith reverence upon the bank. The stranger, Avho had stood watching all this time, uncovered his head, and stepped forward to look at the dead body. Then he solemnly crossed himself, and went on his Avay into the Castle. By this time a new misfortune had befallen Johann. Hardly had he left the precincts of the Castle, when he ran almost into the arms of two soldiers Avho were aimlessly straying through the gardens. He AA'as quickly recognized, and the pair at once took him into their custody, and carried him before the Chancellor, Avho ordered him to be detained in strict confinement The neAvs of his arrest quickly spread, and it Avas not x"], [318, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 306 long before it reached the ears of Dorothea. She at once sought the presence of the Princess Regent During these last few days a secret estrangement had sprung up betAveen Hermengarde and her favourite. Though without any true idea of the Princess's share in the fall of Maximilian, Dorothea could not help per ceiving that her patroness Avas to some extent hostile to the poor King, and the confidence she had formerly felt in her friendship had received a great shock. The absorption of the Princess in the cares of her new situation had kept them apart a good deal, and Avhen they met, the girl could no longer greet Hermengarde Avith the same frank affection as before, and Hermen garde, on her part, shrank more into herself, and no longer indulged in the occasional touches of tenderness by Avhich she had Avon Dorothea's heart. But on the present occasion all these restraints Avere brushed aside. Dorothea rushed in, and fell kneeling before her mistress, crying \u2014 \"Madam, Johann has come back, and they have made him a prisoner ! \" The stern features of the Regent Avere irradiated by a smile of a softness rarely seen there. \" Have no fear, my child,\" she said soothingly. \" Did I not tell you that, Avhatever happened, I Avas your friend.\" And lifting her up, she sounded a gong for the page, Avhom she despatched Avith strict orders to have Johann brought before her at once. \" And now,\" she said, turning to Dorothea, \" I have something to say to your cousin which I do not Avish"], [319, "HERMENGARDE'S TRIUMPH 307 you to hear. Go into my bedroom while I receive him.\" Dorothea went through a door behind the Princess, still too much moved to be able to express her gratitude in words. She had scarcely disappeared when the outer door opened and admitted Karl. His face told the Princess all. \" Maximilian is dead ? \" she said. \"Yes, Madam. He threw himself out of the window of his room into the lake. His body is being dragged for by the soldiers.\" Hermengarde crossed herself. \" Go, and tell the Chancellor that I desire his atten dance immediately.\" The awe-struck wretch departed, and she sank doAvn upon a seat, a prey to the most conflicting emotions. The arrival of Johann Mark disturbed her reflections. He was accompanied by tAvo guards, whom the Princess haughtily dismissed. \" Herr Mark,\" she said, \" we have never met before, but I have reason to think you regard me as your enemy. Nevertheless I have sent for you to tell you that you are a free man. The Chancellor will be here im mediately, and I shall direct him to make you out a free pardon for everything Avhich may have been laid to your charge.\" The prisoner gazed at her in bewilderment. Was this the woman whom every one regarded as the em bodiment of selfishness and unscrupulous ambition ? \" Madam, I must tell you,\" he said at length, \"that, if"], [320, "308 A CROWN OF STRAW, you release me, I shall renew my efforts on behalf of the King.\" Hermengarde gravely shook her head. \" King Maximilian is no more. My son is noAV King of Franconia.\" Johann broke doAvn, and the Princess allowed him time to recover himself, watching him soberly the Avhile. \" I do not Avonder at your emotion,\" she said. \" I wish that my son might have such friends.\" \" But Avhy, Madam,\" asked Johann, as soon as he could speak \u2014 \"Avhy do you show me this unexpected kindness?\" \" I do it at the request of your cousin Dorothea,\" Avas the ansAver. \" She has a deep affection for you. I do not knoAv Avhether it is returned.\" \"It is indeed,\" Avas the Avarm response. \"Ah, Madam, since you are so good as to interest yourself in Dorothea, may I entreat you to Avatch over her here ? Her father is not fit to have charge of her.\" \" I know that. But you, have you never thought of taking his place by a dearer right ? \" \" Madam, I will confess the truth to you. Such an idea never came into my mind till the other day. I Avas even guilty of urging her to accept the offers of the King. When she refused finally, she admitted to me that it Avas because she loved another. And then, for the first time, a light seemed to strike into my own heart, and I found out, too late, that I loved her myself.\" Hermengarde's sombre face relaxed once more. \"Foolish young man,\" she said softly, \"did you never"], [321, "HERMENGARDE'S TRIUMPH. 309 think Avho it Avas that had won your little playmate's heart ? \" The young man started, a joyful gloAv broke out over his features. The Princess Avent quickly to the bed room door, opened it, and brought forth the blushing Dorothea. \"Here is your cousin, child. He has not yet found out whom it is you are in love Avith.\" One look between the tAvo Avas enough. They Avere folded in each other's arms. The Princess detached a string of magnificent diamonds from her neck. \" Here is my wedding present,\" she said, casting it round the young girl. \" Now go, and if you sometimes hear evil things said of Hermengarde of Schwerin- Strelitz, remember that she Avas your friend.\" And bestowing a last kiss upon Dorothea's cheek, she pushed them out of the room. The Chancellor came in directly aftenvards. He found the Princess in her most haughty mood. \"You have heard of my nepheAv's sad fate,\" she said briefly, \"and you are no doubt making all the necessary arrangements for the proclamation of my son.\" \" I am, Madam.\" \" While I remember it, I desire you will at once make out a full and complete pardon for Johann Mark. I have ordered him to be set at liberty.\" The Chancellor ventured to remonstrate. \"Are you aware, Madam, of the serious character of this man ? \""], [322, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 310 \" Yes, sir, I am. But I have found a remedy for all that. He is noAV my very good friend.\" Still the Chancellor faintly objected. He could not so soon forego his vengeance on the man Avho had done so much to thAvart him. \"Your Royal Highness bears in mind the consequences of the unhappy event Avhich has just taken place. There will have to be \u2014 of course as a matter of form \u2014 a fresh appointment in regard to the Regency.\" \" Of course, and in regard to the Chancellorship too, I presume,\" retorted Hermengarde, sharply. \"In the mean time, we both hold our offices, and if it is my last act as Regent and your last act as Chancellor, I order you to make out this pardon.\" \"You shall be obeyed, Madam,\" replied the Count And he kept his Avord. Secure in her son's accession, Hermengarde now thought the time Avas come to throAV off the mask she had worn so long. \"There is another consequence of this event Avhich your loyalty will no doubt be quick to recognize,\" she said. The Chancellor bowed, as one Avho kneAV Avhat was coming. \" I refer of course to my son's marriage. As King of Franconia, this is noAV a matter Avhich has passed out of our hands, and we must be prepared to sacrifice our private Avishes to the interests of the State.\" \"Quite so, Madam. I anticipated that you Avould be compelled to take this view, and it does not find me unprepared. I may before long have the honour of"], [323, "HERMENGARDE'S TRIUMPH. 311 soliciting your Royal Highness's favour for a marriage betAveen my daughter and Herr Moritz.\" \" I shall be much gratified to be present at it,\" replied Hermengarde. \" I have some reason to hope, I may tell you privately, that the Kaiser may be induced to bestoAV one of his sisters on the King.\" Used as he Avas to Court duplicity, the Count could not repress a slight grimace at this cool intimation. \" An admirable arrangement,\" he said, preparing to AvithdraAv ; \" but, as you have said, Madam, this matter has now passed out of our hands.\" As soon as he Avas gone Hermengarde rose, and pro ceeded to seek out her son in his own rooms. At the door of the sleeping-room she Avas stopped by an attendant, Avho said \u2014 \" His Majesty is asleep. He has been unwell, and the doctor has given the strictest orders that he is not to be disturbed.\" Hermengarde shoAved some slight alarm. \" I hope it is nothing serious ? \" she said. \" I believe not, Madam.\" \"Well, I Avill not disturb him. Send the doctor to me.\" She returned thoughtfully toAvards her own room. On the threshold she encountered Karl. \" Well, has the body been found ? \" \"Oh yes, Madam. But, pardon my asking, does your Royal Highness know that the Privy Council is in session ? \" \" The Privy Council ! Without my authority ! Take me there at once ! \""], [324, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 312 Karl led the way, heartily cursing himself for having played so blindly into the hands of the Princess. At the door of the Council-room, the guards would have stopped her, but the imperious Avoman literally thrust them aside, and forced her Avay into the room. The Avhole of the Councillors staying in the Castle Avere present. But there Avas one addition to the number assembled on the last occasion, a man Avhom Hermengarde had never seen before, tall, dark, Avith iron-grey hair, and an expression of the most profound melancholy on his countenance. He sat in a chair at the head of the Council table, Avith the old Chancellor on his right hand, and had just finished affixing his signature to a parchment Avhen the Princess burst in upon them. At first this personage clearly failed to recognize the Princess. But the Chancellor leant over and Avhispered in his ear. He at once rose, the other Councillors following his example. \" Come in, Madam,\" he said gravely. \" We Avere about to send to desire your presence. Will you take that seat.\" And he pointed to one near himself. \" What does all this mean ? \" demanded Hermengarde, disdaining the proffered seat. \" I do not know Avho you are, sir.\" \" My name is Frederick von Astolf. You have perhaps heard of me as the Count von Eisenheim.\" Hermengarde turned pale, and gazed blankly around her. Still she preserved her Avrathful tone. \" I presume you have a right to be here, as. a Privy"], [325, "HERMENGARDE'S TRIUMPH. 313 Councillor, my lord. But Avhy has the Council met Avithout my authority ? \" The Count von Eisenheim turned to the Chancellor, Avith a glance signifying a desire that he should ansAver the question. Von Sigismark eagerly complied, and his voice had in it a ring of long-suppressed resentment. \"It is my duty, Madam, as Chancellor, to call the Council together on a demise of the crown, in order to proclaim the neAv sovereign. In this case, moreover, Ave had also to appoint a Regent.\" \"Well?\" It seemed to Hermengarde that she could scarcely breathe. \" The Council has proclaimed your son King, by the style of Ernest V. And it has declared his Royal Highness Frederick Leopold von Astolf, Regent.\" Hermengarde's eyes flashed Avith fury. \" Be careful, sir. Be careful, gentlemen. By what right have you passed me over ? \" The Chancellor again gave the answer. \" By the family statutes of the House of Astolf, and by the Franconian Constitution, the Regency goes of right to the next heir to the croAvn. It Avould have been illegal to appoint you, Madam.\" The Princess began to realize the bitter truth. She had been completely outwitted by the servile courtier. He had been preparing this bloAV from the very first. \" Enough,\" she said, Avith some dignity. \" I will not say more to you, noAV. In two years my son Avill take the government into his own hands, and then your authority will be over.\" \" I fear not, Madam.\" It was the Regent who spoke,"], [326, "A CROWN OF STRAW. 314 and Hermengarde, looking at him, saAv the deep mourn fulness on his face assume a new and dreadful signifi cance. And then, before anything could happen, she Avas aware of the presence of the tall, spare figure, clad in its long black coat, the sight of Avhich, Avalking across the gardens of Neustadt on a memorable morning, had fallen like a blight upon Maximilian's heart And she reeled back, and sank bereft of spirit upon the ground Avith the sIoav deliberate Avords beating like hammers upon her brain : \" Madam, the King, your son, is mad !\""], [327, "315 EPILOGUE. When the curtain falls on a tragedy in real life, the actors do not take off their dresses and depart to other scenes. They linger upon the stage, and those who care to do so, may watch the slow settling-down of the passions that once led on to the catastrophe. Most of the characters in this story are still alive. Johann and Dorothea are married, and dwell together peacefully in an ancient German city. The ardent reformer keeps to his old ideal, but his methods of working for it have greatly changed. He now believes that till his fellow-countrymen are of one mind as to the value of freedom, it is idle to try and thrust a Republic upon them by force ; and that Avhen they are of one mind the Republic will come of its own accord.

The musician Bernal has recently produced his great opera, The yomsburg Saga, into which he has intro duced a touching allusion to Maximilian's fate.

TAvice in every year, he is visited by a grey-haired Avoman, Avho passes through the ranks of the servants closely veiled, but Avith a step Avhich still retains some of the stateliness that once distinguished the Princess Hermengarde. When the visit is over, the stricken mother returns to her lonely home, in a distant corner of the kingdom, Avhere she lives under the name of the Countess Wal stadt, and bestoAvs the larger part of her revenues upon the poor. The only pleasure she permits herself is the occasional society of Dorothea, who generally brings Avith her a little girl named Hermengarde, Avith flaxen hair and big blue eyes, Avho sits on the elder Avoman's knee, and shyly accepts her caresses.
