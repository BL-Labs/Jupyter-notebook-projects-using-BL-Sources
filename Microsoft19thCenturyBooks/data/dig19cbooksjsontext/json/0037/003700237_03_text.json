' Don't be alarmed,' enjoined Mat Crabtree for the second time, an impossible piece of advice, considering the hour of his call, his aspect, his head turned to listen for the approaching footsteps of still more untimely visitors on the heels of the first. ' I was coming to tell you that there has been an unaccountable egregious mistake somewhere. It will all be rectified presently.' His voice stopped suddenly upon the entrance of the pretty prim housemaid. She was a more formal creature even than a footman, and b VOL. III. .

Yet she betrayed plainly enough, behind her shocked decorum, that she was, as she would have said, ' struck all of a heap.' She announced, ' Two gentlemen wishing to speak to Mr. Prior and Mr. John. Shall I show them in here or up to the drawing room ? ' Her mincing, slightly quavering voice was drowned by a piercing shriek from Susie, who was sitting bolt upright panting for breath. ' Don't let them come near me,' she cried wildly. ' It is not true. \"What has Lamb said ? ' Jack said not a word. His jaw fell a little; a lack-lustre look came into his eyes as he leaned against the window-frame so heavily that his mother in her bewilderment and consternation put her hand upon his arm to draw him back. 'Take care, you will be through the glass,' she warned him."], [15, "THE BLOW FALLS 3 John Prior looked up like a man dazed. 'Eh! What is it, Crabtree? What ails Susie ? \"Who else does the girl say has come before breakfast is well over ? ' The visitors answered in person. They had taken the liberty, conceiving it part of their duty, to follow on the servant's steps, while Susie's shriek had further accelerated their progress. Two respectable enough look ing men of their class, in plain clothes, but with an official air, men perfectly well known in Newton, stepped forward. ' \"We are very sorry, Mr. Prior, but we have no choice,' said the spokesman, hke a man accustomed to bear down opposition \u2014 not harshly, but as a matter of simple necessity. ' We have business here this morning. These are the warrants.' He took out two papers and offered them for inspection. '\"We have come over to arrest, at the instance of the crown, Susan Prior or Crabtree, wife of Lambert Crabtree, of Crab tree's Bank \u2014 this here young lady,' and he n 2"], [16, "BURIED DIAMONDS 4 looked up to put in the parenthesis, ' and John Prior, younger, of Eedcot, that young gentle man there,' he added another explanatory note to all concerned, ' on the charge of having wickedly and feloniously, on the night of the nineteenth or the morning of the twentieth of June, broken open the safe of Crabtree's Bank, Newton, and stolen from it the sum of seven thousand pounds in Bank of England notes, together with a parcel of South American bonds of the value of six thousand pounds.' He ended by the usual caution to his prisoners against making any statement, whether of innocence or guilt, which might be used against them on their trial. There was a second's dead silence, in which one might have heard a pin fall. Susie all convulsed a moment before, sat motionless, as if she were stiffening into stone. Jack did not stir. The next instant the spell was broken by a jarring discord. Tommy rushed barking upon the scene. Instead of the unearthly"], [17, "THE BLOW FALLS 5 stillness there arose a maddening, senseless clamour, for Tommy's example was followed in the form of crying by the two younger children. They wanted no further provocation to express their ignorant alarm in a style in keeping with their tender years. If the officers of justice plainly heard the intolerable din, and were seriously disturbed by it in the discharge of their duty, not another grown-up person was distinctly conscious of the hideous noise, though Mrs. Prior made a mechanical motion with her hand, which signified ' Down, Tommy ; be quiet, good old dog.' Just as instinctively and uncon sciously Bennet Gray caught up Sam \"Wood's and Piers Crabtree's cmmpled-together fingers in her own, clasping them in sign of restraint and encouragement. ' It is an outrageous blunder, as I said,' gasped Mat Crabtree, his voice half choked ; ' the best plan to clear up the error without delay will be for you, Susie, and you, Jack,"], [18, "BURIED DIAMONDS 6 to go at once along with the officers and me to Newton.' ' Of course we'll go,' declared Susie, in a melodious but highly - pitched voice which startled everybody afresh. She was sitting up, smoothing her hair with both hands, in her flushed beauty and natural grace, perfectly recovered from her recent distress, apparently mistress of the situation. ' I was taken by surprise, and nearly frightened out of my wits,' she apologised suavely. ' You know I don't believe my nerves ever will recover from the effects of that atrocious robbery. But when one comes to think of it, was there ever anything so ridiculous heard as proposing to arrest me and Jack for the theft ? Why don't you laugh, Jack ? Of course we'll go, and have the joke out with the magistrate. But won't pa-pa here do? He is a Justice of the Peace. No! Well, it will be greater fun to go to Newton ; I was just about to start \u2014 you all remember? And then Lamb will"], [19, "THE BLOW FALLS 7 share the fun. But first, my good men, have you had any refreshment after your journey?' and Susie turned to the officers of justice who had arrested her, with a movement of the most gracious consideration. ' Mam-ma, will you bid cook see to it, while I am getting ready and the phaeton is brought out ? ' Susie took away what breath was left in the assembled party. The very policemen gaped like the children, glanced inquiringly at each other, and at the rest of the audience, and forgot their good-breeding more than Camilla the housemaid had forgotten hers by grinning in a sickly, imbecile fashion. John Prior had crushed the newspaper he had been holding, let it drop, and risen to his feet, and was staring about him with a working face. ' The lawyers must be stark-staring mad,' he muttered. ' Accuse Susie of robbing the bank, a woman, a gentlewoman, the banker her husband, and her brother mentioned as her accomplice \u2014 it is more than preposterous.'"], [20, "8 BURIED DIAMONDS Then he suddenly faced round with bent brows on his son. ' What have you to say to it, Jack ? You can surely say something,' with rising irrita tion. ' I can't,' answered Jack, with so great an effort that it sounded like a groan, bending brows which were marvellously like those of his questioner. An indignant voice spoke up for him. ' The accusation is so unutterably absurd, it is not worth replying to.' It was not Mrs. Prior or Jane who said these words. Mrs. Prior, indeed, had not given way ; she was very pale, but she stood erect, with eyes which saw all that passed and ears that heard every word ; and she stepped forward between her husband and son as if to put a hand on each. But Jane clung to her mother as she had not clung since she was a little child. It was Bennet Gray who spoke with impatient scorn, which"], [21, "THE BLOW FALLS 9 changed to abashed mortification before the words were wTell out of her mouth. She had no acknowledged right to speak there. How could she stand up and defend him before his father and mother, friends and strangers, when their relations \u2014 hers and Jack's \u2014 had neither been openly proclaimed by him nor rightly recognised by others ? Even at this moment \u2014 after one glance that seemed to appeal to her passionately \u2014 he turned away from her. There was no farther outcry, Susie's bearing and Jack's silence forbade it. It would have been equivalent to admitting a belief in the sister and brother's guilt. It would have been unworthy of the family themselves, as well as an insult to Susie and Jack, to resent and resist the action of the law, however eccentric, and to reproach or execrate the men who were there to do their duty. Susie was certainly hurrying her departure. In place of getting up any obstacle or betray-"], [22, "BURIED DIAMONDS 10 ing the least reluctance, she was continuing to remind everyone that she had been on the point of starting for the Bank House. She was calling for aid to collect her various properties and to see her off. She was slightly staggered on being told that she was to go with her brother and the policemen in a cab, which they had brought from Newton, instead of being driven over in the phaeton by Jack, as she had proposed, while her luggage should follow her. As for her brother-in-law, it was only by the courtesy of the officers that he was to be permitted to accompany them. But Mrs. Lambert Crabtree insisted, against every prohibition and remonstrance, that she would take her children with her. According to Susie, she could not now be parted from darling little Mollie and Piers even for a few hours, though she had often before left them for twice as many weeks. \"What were the speakers thinking of? They did not know a mother's feelings. The idea was not to"], [23, "THE BLOW FALLS 11 be entertained for a second that she was to leave her blessed babies behind her, even in the care of their grandmamma, and Aunt Jane, and Miss Gray \u2014 who was so obliging in hearing the children say their lessons along with Molly and Piers's cousins. It was not altogether nice to take the little ones home in a common cab. She was afraid their papa would not hke it ; but she was not aware that there had been any fever patients driven to the infirmary lately, and she w7ould run the risk rather than be separated an hour longer than she could help from her pets. Susie had her way at this moment, as usual. The children were suffered to accompany her, room being made for them with some difficulty by the bigger of the policemen going on the box with the driver. The preparing and starting Mollie and Piers increased the confusion, as well as threw a slightly different air over the party \u2014 so that,"], [24, "BURIED DIAMONDS 12 if Susie had these ends also in view, she attained them likewise. Jane and Miss Gray, instead of the servants, waited upon Susie and the children. Jane's hands shook, while Susie's were steady, and Bennet was dumb before the excited chatter which the little Crabtrees struck up in the prospect of the journey. Mr. Prior had gone aside with Mat Crab tree, Mrs. Prior had one moment which she could call her own with her son. ' What is it, my boy?' she asked him piteously. 'Of course, it is all a stupid blunder ; but why do you take it in this way ? Why are you not able to make a jest of it, as Susie does ? What is it, Jack ? ' ' I can't tell you, mother,' answered Jack, with a restless gesture, and at the same time with an expression as if he was weary of the whole matter with utter weariness. ' Ask Susie, if you like ; I have nothing to tell.' John Prior scarcely appeared to follow the"], [25, "THE BLOW FALLS 13 arguments of his friend urging him to stay where he was at Eedcot, pledging himself \u2014 Mat Crabtree \u2014 to see Susie and Jack through this amazing farce of a trouble, undertaking to find bail (which might be asked as a form), swearing that, if offered, bail would be accepted. Mat tried farther to explain how so unnatural a charge had been brought. The stolen bank notes had been found secreted in the Bank House. The dishonest servant who had most probably done the deed had not yet been detected. It was incumbent on the police and detectives to do something. By venturing on a ruse like this \u2014 however transparent the ruse \u2014 they might succeed in throwing the real culprits off their guard, and so let the law get on their track. Jack mechanically kissed his mother and sister and wrung Bennet's hand, but without looking in her face. He was going away silent and gloomy, as if he was the actual depredator."], [26, "BURIED DIAMONDS 14 Susie, on the contrary, was as lavish in reassuring smiles as in tender caresses. ' Oh, how we'll laugh at it all some day,' she cried. ' What a story it will be to tell, that I was taken up \u2014 actually taken up \u2014 for robbing my husband's bank ! Poor little me a burglar ! It is a subject for Punch,' and she held up her small hands. ' How on earth did I do it ? On the night of the volunteer ball, too, of all nights, when I was so tired and sleepy. Molly and Piers, your mam-ma is a heroine labouring under a grotesquely grim accusation, or else she is a virago or a ghoul, for anything you know or she herself can tell.' When her foot was on the step of the cab she turned lightly and ran back into the hall, to give a last direction about her trunks. Her father was standing half-way down the stair ; she went up to him swiftly, passed an arm round his neck and kissed him again. ' Cheer up, papa darling. It is a horrid bore, but it is all a wild night mare, an insane delusion.'"], [27, "THE BLOW FALLS 15 ' Was it so ? ' John Prior asked himself, as the cab rolled off, and the servants who had been hiding away for very shame on the family's account came stealing into sight. Had Susie kissed him just under that grisly daub of Judas Iscariot betraying his Master, which the squire of Eedcot had well nigh forgotten these many years ? Whom did that strange, haggard face \u2014 wan \u2014 but with a hectic glow like a splash of blood on the pallid cheeks, resemble ?

Happily not one among many thousands of the myriads of families in which men and women are set in this world, are fated to experience such a shock \u2014 such a moral earthquake as was undergone at Eedcot on the morning on which Susie Crabtree and Jack Prior were arrested there. How do the tragically exceptional innocent people to whom such shocks come behave on these unique occasions ? Is it a fact that there is a limit to our capacity for pain \u2014 that when a mother and her child, or brothers and sisters, grown up men and women, perish together in a fire or by the upsetting of a boat,"], [29, "THE PILLARS OF THE FALLING HOUSE 17 the surviving members of the families \u2014 the husband and father who is at once a widower and childless, the parents bereft of sons and daughters by a single blow \u2014 are stunned as well as stricken, and rendered for a time at least mer cifully incapable of realising the extent of their misfortune ? Do they mourn, but with not more bitter and excessive grief than a sensitive man or woman might have felt for the loss of one human creature who was dear ? This may be true in a family shipwreck such as had befallen the Priors, the nature of which, to people of honourable antecedents, who have led honest and well-regulated lives, is as incredible as it is rare. Susie and Jack were gone under trying circumstances, but these were so astounding that it was impossible fully to realise them till an interval had passed. There was much more loud lamentation in the kitchen than in the drawing-room \u2014 and in the former region a sense of mournful enjoy ment soon entered into the proceedings, as into VOL. 111. c"], [30, "18 BURIED DIAMONDS a funeral feast, when the funeral is not one in which the guest is nearly concerned. The sombre satisfaction in this instance had the agreeable addition of a strong spice of excite ment. Miss Susie that was, and Mr. Jack charged with robbing a bank between them, perhaps lodged in Newton Jail by that time, was dreadful, but it was also thrilling. Upstairs, the family, and the woman who had tacitly become a member of it for the moment, looked at each other in blank wonder and consternation. What did it mean ? What grain of truth, of probability at least, had led to such an undreamt-of catastrophe ? John Prior pulled himself together and walked heavily to his study, to lock himself in and take counsel with himself, to bury his head in his hands, and ask himself \u2014 was this the retribution which Lambert Crabtree had threat ened ? How had it been brought about ? Could he \u2014 John Prior \u2014 have prevented it at one time by a word of his mouth, which, if"], [31, "THE PILLARS OF THE FALLING HOUSE 19 spoken now, if shouted in the market-place, would be wholly in vain. Jack and Susie branded for life, proclaimed common thieves ! Perhaps they had been drawn into some weak compromise, which constituted them partners in the guilt of a far greater sinner. He, their father, could not, for the life of him, in spite of his long apprenticeship to spleen and gloom, conceive that the girl and boy \u2014 they were still girl and boy to him \u2014 had committed a bare faced, vulgar crime, as gross an intellectual blunder as it was a heinous moral offence. Why, it was so egregious an error, by the sim plest reasoning, as to argue a lack of reason amounting to fatuous imbecility or hair-brained insanity in the man or woman of the rank of the Priors who fell into the delusion. What were the inducements which could lead to such a mania ? Susie's husband's difficulties, Jack's scrapes and debts \u2014 supposing he had contracted more. These might be alleged in a court of law, but they were totally inadequate. c 2"], [32, "BURIED DIAMONDS 20 In the drawing-room Bennet Gray roused herself in time to stop Ally from asking with round-eyed speculation and great glibness in leaping at a conclusion, whether Aunt Susie and Uncle Jack had been traitors or highwaymen, as Aunt Susie had seemed to say, and whether the gentlemen who had come for them were going to take them to the Tower ? But surely nobody would think of cutting off Aunt Susie's head with its fringe. Uncle Jack would not let them, he would fight for both. Miss Gray took the children to their nurse, to learn more prosaic annals of arrests from her gossip with her fellow-servants than were to be drawn from a child's history of England. When Bennet went back to the women's sanctuary, she found Mrs. Prior sitting patiently in her usual place, surrounded by her books and the materials for her work, though she was doing nothing unless seeking to recover herself. Jane was more restless. She was moving here and there, coming always back to her"], [33, "THE PILLARS OF THE FALLING HOUSE 21 mother's side and appealing to her.

It was the strangest, most pathetic thing to hear Jane \u2014 so self-reliant in her own fine \u2014 so tempted to undervalue what was apart from it \u2014 and so accustomed to regard her mother as good and dear, but as long left behind in the march of mind, thus turning and looking up to the elder woman's broader human experience and deeper knowledge of life in the hour of trial. It was equally strange and pathetic, in the order of nature, which is older and wiser in its instincts than any acquired knowledge, to see how Mrs. Prior bore herself. She had been content to bide her time, would have been more than content to bide it for ever, rather than have shared in such an awakening. But"], [34, "BURIED DIAMONDS -> 2 now she instantly resumed her place as one of the heads of the house, one of the bearers of its burdens, and showed herself ready, strong in her wifely and motherly instincts, for whatever demand might be made on her.

These qualities contest so successfully with feminine weakness as to render women stronger than men on certain occasions, not only ' ministering angels ' but rulers born for adversity. Bennet left the mother and daughter to gether, and went boldly to Mr. Prior's study door, where she knocked for admittance. There was a muttered protest within, a slow, reluctant tread to the door, which was unlocked, and the applicant had to stand for a moment the stare of utter astonishment and displeasure cast on the intruder.

' May I speak with you, Mr. Prior ? ' peti tioned Bennet quickly, as an excuse for her being there. ' WeU, Miss Gray, I should have thought that it would be tolerably plain to you I am engaged this morning,' he protested, with al most vehement sarcasm. ' This is not a time for unnecessary discussion.' Then he thought better of it, and held the door for her to pass in. ' Perhaps you are right,' he corrected him self formally, with a latent bitterness in the concession. ' It is better to act without delay when it can be done.

No doubt my grandchildren will miss your valuable instruction, but the loss cannot be helped, unfortunately.

' Allow me to write you a cheque for the quarter's salary. A h ! I forgot, my cheque-book is on Crabtree's Bank ; but there is money in the house \u2014 Jack brought a supply.' He stopped abruptly ; Jack's name had been too much for him.

' I can guess that there has been some wretched love affair,' admitted Mr. Prior sternly, and that you have probably considered your self engaged in marriage to my son.' Bennet bowed her head, which was hanging low enough already. ' So you came beforehand to spy the land. I shall not make any further comment than that it was ingenious of you,' he said, with a sneer. ' It was very wrong \u2014 I see that now,' she said, with straightforward simplicity and with more composure, as she made the confession, ' but you will not choose this moment to punish me.

I can only make some things clear to you which I must conclude you do not rightly comprehend. I am not the prosperous man you may have imagined me to be when you received Jack's unwarrantable addresses. I am poor ; I was on the verge of ruin before the event of the morning.

' Never ! ' exclaimed Bennet, indignantly raising her comely head high enough now. ' What, give up Jack !

The truth is I would not listen to him till he consented to go to one of the colonies and seek to make a home for us both there, where I might have worked with and for him, without degrading him and me in his people's eyes.

Then, during"], [40, "BURIED DIAMONDS 28 his absence, I succeeded to my cousin's fortune ; for I am not poor, like most schoolmistresses, I am rich ; I am fit to marry a squire's son, if money was the only consideration.'

' I wished to learn for myself the real character of Jack's friends and of his relations with them. I was vain enough to imagine that I might help to make peace.

There are so many much more im portant things to be thought of now, and I am sure no time should be lost.

Yet he was not without an underlying feehng of dull surprise and secret satisfaction \u2014 altogether passive to begin with, in the discovery that Jack, his son, with all his defects and faults, had made a woman like the one before John Prior \u2014 a woman rich in attractions and gifts \u2014 love the young man desperately, infatuatedly, so that she was ready to give up everything for his sake."], [47, "A COMPROMISE 35 And it was with old-world politeness and fairness, however coldly and with a suspicion of irony still not stamped out of him, that John Prior chose to accompany his future daughter-in-law back to the family circle, and to take that, the first, opportunity of introduc ing her to its members in a new character. ' I wish to let you know,' he said, speaking to Mrs. Prior and Jane, ' that Miss Gray has done me the honour to acquaint me with an earlier engagement between her and Jack, and with her determination to stand by it and him. In justice to myself, I cannot say that I approve of her resolution, though, in consideration for him, I am driven to acquiesce in it. I have also to tell you that it is not Miss Gray, the children's teacher, but an unsuspected heiress whom we have been entertaining unawares, who has been masquerading among us, that I present to you.

The women who served as an audience to the extraordinary speech had been so thunder struck and overwhelmed this morning already that they could not rise on the instant to fresh experiences of marvelling and strong feeling, whether of approval or disapproval. Their very intellects were stupefied, and the pair listened languidly, with a mystified, scared look, as if, on the one hand, they could not take in the tale, and, on the other, they feared for John Prior's wits. At last a gleam of joy, like a passing sunbeam piercing dark clouds, shot across Jane Prior's open face. She rose and went up to Bennet and clasped and kissed her in acceptance of her as a sister. ' You are really to be one of us,' she said, with little gasps after coherence ; ' you are not shrinking from us after what has happened to-day. You"], [49, "A COMPROMISE 37 are cleaving to poor Jack, though I knew you were too good for him already, before we were aware you were rich, except in what is far better than money. I am glad, for all our sakes.' But Mrs. Prior did no more than agree with a chilling submission to her husband's and her son's will. ' If you have given your con sent, John,' she said, with a glance at her husband, but without a look for poor trembling, shrinking Bennet, who appeared, in truth, as if she were the humble petitioner for mercy, aud not the flattered, looked-up to dispenser of bounties, ' of course, mine goes with it. That needs no commentary, and is of little con sequence.' Later, when Mrs. Prior .seemed to awake to Bennet Gray's unaccounted-for possession of worldly goods, the sole effect on an exceedingly unworldly woman was somehow to induce her to make a speech which struck the girl's wounded ears hke cruel mockery. She (Mrs."], [50, "BURIED DIAMONDS 38 Prior) was afraid she had unwittingly failed in the consideration to which Miss Gray was probably accustomed \u2014 that she might think the family at Eedcot ought to have shown her. She might have missed something in her ac commodation which she had a right to regard as her due. This to Bennet, who was if possible hardier and simpler than Jane in her habits, who would have been willing at no distant date to have kissed the ground that the elder woman trod, who would have accepted gratefully the poorest quarters that Mrs. Prior had awarded to her ! It was evident that Mrs. Prior resented the entrance of the new member into the family at this low ebb of their fortunes quite as much, possibly more, than if the Priors had been in the hey-day of their prosperity. No constancy or loyalty on Bennet's part, no benefits she could confer, reconciled the mistress of the house to the promotion to a daughter's place"], [51, "A COMPROMISE 39 there of a woman who had dwelt beneath its roof for many months under false colours. It was by no means the fact of Bennet's having been what Lambert Crabtree had defined as ' a hired servant ' that stuck so fast in Mrs. Prior's throat ; she could have swallowed that objection faster than most squires' wives would have swallowed it. It was, as Mrs. Prior believed honestly, the deceit with which she had been treated, the treachery which had been going on so long under her unsuspecting eyes, that she could not pardon. So the wife and mother revolted at the distinction which was thenceforth to be Bennet's portion, that could not be entirely disguised. The very servants remarked on it, though they knew no more than that Miss Gray was the trusted and confidential governess and friend of the family which she had been for some time. But it puzzled them a little to find her come so much to the front in this disastrous crisis. It ap peared as if nothing could be done without"], [52, "BURIED DIAMONDS 40 her. She strove to keep herself in the back ground ; nobody could accuse her of self assertion or arrogance. Nevertheless, it was not to be concealed that she took an active part in the measures which Mr. Prior was rousing himself to adopt in the circumstances. More than once Miss Gray was summoned to Mr. Prior's study to join with him and Miss Jane in a consultation from which Mrs. Prior for some reason held herself aloof. But the mistress of the house had so slipped into the position of a spectator rather than an actor in the affairs of the family, not to say a controller of them, that her passiveness on this occasion wras by comparison scarcely noticed. If one person perceived Mrs. Prior's withdrawal with remorse and shame, she dared not call attention to the anomaly, or try to obviate it, any more than she could take it upon her to show her former friend the letters which Miss Gray was writing on John Prior's behalf, and carrying to him for inspection. But it was hard for Mrs."], [53, "A COMPROMISE 41 Prior to brook Miss Gray's coming forward as Jack's chief help and stay in the day of his adversity, to feel that his mother was superseded even here in her most sacred privilege. Mat Crabtree was again able to send much needed consolation to Eedcot. In the course of the afternoon he could write, if not that the case had been instantly dismissed, at least that bail had been accepted both for Susie and Jack, The sister and brother were at liberty, and had gone to the Bank House, where it was considered advisable that Jack should remain with the Crabtrees for the present. It would be more convenient if they had to go through the form of getting up a defence. There was a good deal of reading between the fines of the note which Mat Crabtree had carefully refrained from putting down in black and white. He omitted any admission of the seriousness of the case. He suppressed the difficulties that had to be surmounted before bail was received. He did not record the"], [54, "BURIED DIAMONDS 42 points that were stretched in deference to the social position of the accused \u2014 above all to Susie's delicate beauty and feminine charm. She had hurried in from Eedcot with the children she could not bear to leave behind her ; she was relying on her husband, who had returned just in time, and was lending her his support in her painful position. How was it possible for any magistrate with a heart in his bosom, to look unmoved at that confiding, clinging creature in her refined grace and innocent unconsciousness of the danger and disgrace of the situation ? Whatever the burden of proof against her, he could not tear her from her home and family and send her to a common prison. It would be as much as her life was worth. It would be executing her sentence upon her before she was judged, and that long after capital punishment had been abolished for robbery without manslaughter.

He had gone so far as absolutely to refuse to return to his father's house under the present circum stances. There was yet another detail of the morn ing's work which the writer neglected to supply, though it had struck him forcibly at the time. \"When he had driven into Newton in such humiliation as his worst nightmare had never suggested, in the middle of his dismay and confusion, while he had hardly dared to raise his honest eyes and confront his numerous acquaintances, he had been impressed by finding them nowhere. All Newton was palpitating and quaking with the news, but it looked like a town deserted by its inhabitants. In the first blush of the catastrophe there was a natural recoil from witnessing its result. The same people who might to-morrow run to crowd and stare at the ugly spectacle of human collapse and degradation drew back and kept"], [56, "BURIED DIAMONDS 44 out of sight to-day. Not a face was visible at a window, not a head was thrust out of a shop door. A few foot-passengers and drivers of carts and carriages in the streets made as if they did not see anything unusual going on. The lamentable downfall of the Priors and Crabtrees was not beheld, to begin with, by a triumphant populace. 'Call no man happy till he die,' said the wise man. In a like spirit, ' call no day wretched till the day close.' The night before, Bennet had bemoaned an ignominious ending to a marked day in her life, which she had rashly chronicled beforehand with a white stone. In her ignorance she had railed at the past evening, and counted it the most intolerable she should ever have to know. Yet, matched with the woful day which had fol lowed, she was iuclined to look back on the moment of Jack's betrayal of their engagement, and call its vexation \u2014 poignant as it was at the time, sweet and not bitter, full of compensations"], [57, "A COMPROMISE 45 \u2014 lit up with hope in the future, having no real appalling burden of misfortune on the point of falling and crushing every bright prospect. Bennet believed she only got through the long summer day of Jack's arrest by the excite ment of her appeal to his father, and the bustle of work into which she plunged for his deli verance. Night came at last bringing the merciful shrouding darkness and oblivion which is at once so welcome and so terrible to the wretched, because with light consciousness must return. John Prior had been in the habit of reading family prayers from the date of his marriage and of his becoming the responsible, head of a household. As ten o'clock struck he came mechanically into the drawing-room and sat down in his customary chair, but, when the bell was about to be rung to summon the servants, he put out his hand to arrest the summons. ' I cannot, Susan,' he said hoarsely"], [58, "BURIED DIAMONDS 46 to his wife, 'I cannot to-night or to-morrow either, after what happened this morning. It is not fit. I would not face the very maids if I could help it, and this must seem mockery to them.' But Mrs. Prior rose up, all herself again for the moment, came round from her corner to his side, and pled with him. ' If we have asked God's protection and forgiveness all these years, John, shall we fail to seek them now, when we want them more than ever? Shall we fling back His past mercies and present pity in the face of our Maker ? We have done nothing that we need fear to look in the faces of our fellow-creatures. They know that as well as we do, and will not misjudge us or forget that we have led honest, friendly fives among them. Let them see you be the man you've always been ; show that you trust them, and that you trust God still, with your unhappy children as well as with your self. I ask it as a favour of you, John Prior,"], [59, "A COMPROMISE 47 and I have not asked any personal favour for a long time. Jane will bring the books before the servants come and look up the places, so that the ordeal may be short. If you like I'll read the chapter and psalms, as I did when your eyes were ailing \u2014 don't you remember?' He remembered what an effort it had cost the shy woman to control herself and summon courage to assume, even so far, the office of the family priest to the household in days gone by. But now her tongue did not falter, and her thin cheek was neither dyed with a blush nor robbed of every vestige of colour, as she sat by his side in the midst of those who had seen the manner in which her son and daughter had been taken from her that morning. Thus some drops of the dew of Heaven were distilled and dropped in soothing balm to quiet the strife of tongues and soothe the fever of anguish in these poor tortured hearts."], [60, "48 BURIED DIAMONDS CHAPTEE IV. AN EMBASSY. Days, even weeks, passed, until a sort of grue some familiarity grew up in the minds of people interested and uninterested in an event so improbable, disgraceful, and unspeakably miser able as the charge against Mrs. Lambert Crab tree and her brother. It began to be a matter of course, as if it had been a conclusion always to be anticipated, that Susie Crabtree and her brother had been accused of robbing Crabtree's Bank, had been arrested, were out on bail, and must stand their trial at the Assize held at a country town which, fortunately, was not Newton, but Crow minster, several miles further from Eedcot."], [61, "AN EMBASSY 49 The whole incredible, wretched story seemed to ring in Bennet Gray's ears from morning to night till every syllable was lodged in her memory and riveted there, and her entire mind was usurped so that she could think of nothing else, as when life or death in a sick room engrosses the faculties of the watchers. Eemonstrances from without, of which there were some, though there could not be many, touched her but slightly. One of the late Josh Gray's friends, a light of the law whom she had consulted, took the trouble to write and deliver a strong opinion upon the late great practitioner's cousin and heiress mixing herself up with people who could get into such grave trouble as had befallen the Priors. But he received so unqualified an answer for his pains that he decided the young lady had a mind of her own, and must be left to waste poor Josh Gray's money as she chose.

Mat Crabtree, who had been fully en lightened throughout their acquaintance with regard to Miss Gray's possessions, when he was told of the line of conduct she was pursuing, discussed it apart with John Prior, who had been overborne by her into taking her at her word. Mat induced the squire of Eedcot to make a fresh stand, backed by a responsible ally, and to remonstrate anew on the sacrifice she was beut on making. Mat Crabtree ex plained elaborately how money could be raised as he himself was raising it, without having recourse to a young lady who at that moment was totally unconnected with the Priors either by blood or marriage. But Miss Gray resisted the two men, either of them old enough to be her father, as stoutly as if they had been her contemporaries."], [63, "AN EMBASSY 51 ' I can surely do what I hke with my own What is it to anyone else how I dispose of my money ? I have often mourned over being an orphan without near relatives, but I have thought there was one small compensation \u2014 I was my own mistress,' she protested, almost angrily. ' Why do you force me to tell you over again that I promised myself to Jack when I was poor, and that, as I will never go back from my word, whatever he may do or say, he is the next thing to my husband in my eyes ? If you will not accept my help I shall engage counsel on my own responsibility, and let the world think what it chooses.' Bennet had imagined Jack Prior owning and claiming her before his friends ; but, as it turned out, it was she who had to own and claim Jack, and she did not flinch from the ob ligation. She stood the brunt of every attack on her unmoved. Not only was she unlike Susie Crabtree in not being given to cast her burden on another, and to cling to whoever E 2"], [64, "BURIED DIAMONDS 52 would bear the imposition, Bennet was not even upheld by Jack. He went on steadily, refusing to come out to Eedcot, where Susie would have had no objection to reappear if she had got any encouragement. Jack only wrote one letter in return for the score of letters Bennet Gray sent him, not caring \u2014 at least not caring sufficiently to cause her to let her pen lie idle for twenty four hours \u2014 that she had no answer save that single note. He told her so briefly in the page and a half she could only guess at the mortal misery with which the words were scrawled, that their engagement, with all their happy hopes and plans for the future, was at an end. A man charged with a bank robbery, and bound to undergo a trial, whether he were found guilty or not, was not a fit husband for her or any innocent girl of spotless reputation aud honourable antecedents, even though she had been as penniless as he had thought her. She was to have nothing more to say to him. He believed it would have been a happy"], [65, "AN EMBASSY 53 riddance, even if all this had not happened ; an ugly, stupid, idle cub, who had been 'no good ' to anybody connected with him. She would be infinitely better without him, if she could only see it, and he hoped she would be happy, and said with his whole heart, God bless her for all she had wished to be to him. But he could not hear of the connection lasting a day longer ; he would be a selfish brute to think of it. On the other hand, ever since she had known him, when Jack had fallen over head and ears in love with her on the first day of their acquaintance, Bennet had felt in some occult fashion accountable for the lad, bound to look after him, take care of him, and cherish him. It was from no want of manliness in him. Manliness was one of Jack's most conspicuous characteristics ; and in place of being back ward, he had been rather too forward and sanguine in urging his suit when he had nothing, independent of his father, to offer the woman"], [66, "BURIED DIAMONDS 54 he sought for his wife. It was the peculiar tie which unites certain natures, the form which love takes in the hearts of some women, and those among the noblest of their sex. Bennet's young lover was her natural charge, as well as her natural protector. He was, as coming events cast their shadows before, her lord and master ; he was at the same time nearly as much her boy as he was his mother's. Bennet's command of the means to carry on the contest had earned for her, without claim on her part, the right to be consulted. Besides, her quick intelligence and fearless spirit would have qualified her to come forward in any diffi culty. She had learned all there was to know, and had been taken into masculine confidences from which the other women in tenderness for them had been excluded. Yet Mrs. Prior could have shared the knowledge with Bennet and not have given way, but only grown more full of resource the greater the demand on her powers \u2014 only Mrs. Prior had elected that there"], [67, "AN EMBASSY 55 should be no alliance between her and her future daughter-in-law. The consciousness of the severed friendship, wduch had been so sore at first, had ceased almost to be felt by Bennet. For how could she pause to dwell on any minor grievance when her heart was full to bursting of Jack and his piteous strait ? Bennet had been forced to apprehend the seriousness of the outlook, not only that the presumptive evidence was next to damning against Susie before so startling and prejudicial a step as the arrest of a woman in her position was risked by competent authorities, but that there were many unlucky coincidences in ap parent corroboration of Jack Prior's participa tion in his sister's guilt which might compromise him fatally.

Above all, his dogged silence in declining to make any statement which would throw light on the matter, all were so many suspicious circumstances which the accused man's counsel, however skilful and eminent in his profession, would find it hard to get rid of. There was one little glimmer of comfort which came to Bennet in her tribulation ; not only was Jane free from envy of the supremacy to which her fellow -student had attained, and inclined to be sisterly with a greater longing for sympathy on her own account than the girl had ever before experienced ; but just as a spiritual door had closed between Bennet and Mrs. Prior, so a mode of communication was"], [69, "AN EMBASSY 57 opened, and grew wider day by day, between Miss Gray and John Prior. The young woman, the heritage of whose age and character it was that she could not despair and would not doubt, who was devoted to her purpose unhesitatingly and unsparingly, gained with every hour upon the beaten, disappointed man. Her nature worked upon his, till she restored to some extent his tottering belief in his son. At least Jack could not be base when she vouched for his truth. Her unshaken convic tion of his worth went far to prove him worthy iu a fashion. Bennet shed tears of joy in her night of sorrow when she found out for herself that John Prior had been to Newton, and been at the Bank House, where he had asked Jack to accompany him to the post-office and the railway station \u2014 a request which Jack, taken unawares and suspecting nothing, had granted. The result was that the father and son had been seen together in the most public places in the towu, and that one of the"], [70, "BURIED DIAMONDS 58 disastrous exaggerated allegations likely to be brought against the young man \u2014 namely, that he was an incorrigible scapegrace, at open war with his father \u2014 must be materially weakened by this contradictory evidence. Bennet did not know whether the incident reached Mrs. Prior, and whether she set it down also to the debtor and creditor account she had established between herself and the woman whom her son loved, and who loved him. Mrs. Prior might look upon it as a fresh wrong done to that other woman who had loved him longer, asking nothing again ; as one more instance in which she, the wife and mother, had been defrauded even of her wifely voice, her influence with the father on behalf of the son. Withal, Mrs. Prior had risen up to meet adversity as best she could. She had been quiet and self-restrained. For some time pre viously the reins of domestic government had been held slackly in her hands. The old"], [71, "AN EMBASSY 59 house, with old Martha the cook, old Eichard the coachman, the old gardener, and the younger servants under them, had very much kept itself. It was different now, when a stormy blast had shaken the establishment to its foundations, upset routine and rules, and let loose the elements of disorder, well-nigh of anarchy. However faithful the staff of servants, they could not be expected to sustain the ordeal unmoved. But Mrs. Prior gathered up the reins, superintended each department as in her younger, more active years, saw that all was ordered rightly as it had been hereto fore, and provided carefully for the comfort of each member of the community, including her natural enemy, Miss Gray. When the domestic machinery worked once more like clock-work, a sense of stability returned to the house, which had been, as it were, rocking wildly. Men and women went back to their several duties \u2014 dinner was not three minutes too late, the plate was cleaned, the horses were groomed"], [72, "BURIED DIAMONDS 60 with the accustomed regularity. A fulness of confidence succeeded to the sense of un steadiness when Mrs. Prior was heard talking to Tommy, checking an uncanny disposition to howl which the old dog, as he detected something wrong, with canine acuteness, had manifested lately to the superstitious horror of the servants' hall. The mistress of the family was even seen to sit down in her own corner and put a few stitches into one of her quilts \u2014 a proceeding which had an excellent effect. The little Woods ceased to stray over the house and gather such husks of gossip as the children could pick up. They began to play again at their old familiar games, to attend to their rabbits and pigeons, to confine the children's chatter to their own small concerns. The grown-up people commenced to believe it possible not only that the sky would not fall and the world would go on as it used to do, but that the clouds might pass away from Eedcot, the sun shine out once more as"], [73, "AN EMBASSY 61 it had shone a year \u2014 a month ago, and every thing be as it had been formerly. Mrs. Prior contributed her quota, and that not a small one, in stemming the tide, which might have prevailed till it accomplished the demolition of the family framework. John Prior forbade his wife and daughter to enter Newton. Mrs. Prior complied condi tionally. She would respect her husband's wishes unless \u2014 she did not say what misadven ture or what epoch was to hmit her obedience. Jane shrank of her own accord from the expedi tion. She could bear to see Jack, but not Susie. Her unprincipled extravagance had much to do with all the misery. Jane did not dare to say more even to her own heart. It had come to this, then, that Bennet Gray, acting on her own idea and on a hint from Jack Prior's counsel, volunteered her services, and accepted a commission from Mr. Prior to go to Newton, see both Susie and Jack, and gather what she could of the truth from them."], [74, "BURIED DIAMONDS 62 If John Prior had to give up his daughter, there was no help for it \u2014 at least he might take refuge in the knowledge that she was a married woman, and that, if she had committed a crime, it must have been at the instigation of a repro bate of a husband, who had exposed her to the danger of wliich he was to have reaped the fruits. But John Prior could not suffer his son to be the victim of his sister's treachery. What ever the father had thought of the son in the past, it was John Prior's part to come to Jack's rescue now ; it was all the more and not the less his part because of the alienation which had existed between the two. Jack's cause was his father's cause, and that of the woman who would go through fire and water for her lover, who loved him even as the woman who had borne him loved him. The lad was not forsaken. There was no objection to Bennet Gray's going to Newton. She would not be openly shamed in the deed. As Mat Crabtree had"], [75, "AN EMBASSY 63 said, there was as yet no confessed connection of blood or marriage between her and any Prior or Crabtree. Her position in the Eedcot family, which was all the public knew of her, would render it not at all out of the way that she should go as a messenger between Eedcot and the Bank House. Bennet had almost forgotten during these heavily-cumbered days whether the season was summer or winter. When she went up to her room for her hat and jacket, she recognised, almost with wonder, that the noisette roses were still drooping in great white clusters, like scidptured flowers, on a railing opposite. The shiver which, when she had leisure to feel it, was always running through her veins now, must be in the blood and not in the air. As she came down stairs she saw Jane by the hall table tying string round some little parcels. One of them contained a few of Susie's super fluities, a pet fan, a favourite scent bottle, a hood to wear when she indulged in a nap,"], [76, "BURIED DIAMONDS 64 which their owner had left behind her at Red cot and was clamouring to have sent to her. With another unusual instance of recollection and consideration in trifles, showing how Jane was waking up from her mental absorption, she had also put up some of cook's cakes, and the little Woods' books and toys for Molly and Piers Crabtree. Jane explained \u2014 l Their uncle says they are very much left to themselves, ]K>or children, while Susie will not let them be taken out of the turmoil to run about in peace either here or at Haybridge. What I have sent may help to amuse them. You will not mind looking after the parcels, will you, Miss Gray?' Jane refrained from the use of Bennet's Christian name, not because of any reluctance to take the privilege of their future relationship with her friend, but because of that habitual obliviousness and lack of glibness which made Jane in her wisdom so devoid of tact and practical cleverness, compared to Susie in her"], [77, "AN EMBASSY 65 folly. Even under the circumstances, Bennet could not refrain from a suspicion that Jane Piior had probably let her stumbling choice fall on the most indigestible of cook's dainties and the most unentertaining of the Woods' books and toys \u2014 those ' Conversations on the Tele scope ' and that miniature globe, Jane's own gifts originally, which were supposed to com bine instruction and amusement. Molly and Piers might snatch these loans out of each other's hands, come to blows over the temporary novelties, tear or break them, but would not otherwise honour them with juvenile patronage However, the amiable intention was every thing. ' Of course, I'll not mind,' said Bennet. ' Is there anything else I can do ?

Perhaps the baskets were on the table by accident, and it was not meant that Miss Gray should take them in the phaeton with her. Mrs. Prior arrived on the scene in time to account for the baskets. ' May I trouble you ? ' she said formally yet simply enough ; ' Susie is very fond of mush rooms, which none of the rest care for. She used always to claim the first from Eedcot, where we have not had them early this year. The pears are from the tree which Jack planted when he was a boy in his garden.' ' Is there nothing more 1 can say from you ? ' asked Bennet, faltering in her wistful ness. ' Nothing ; thanks.' Mrs. Prior froze again instantly. Bennet was not to be favoured with any communication beyond what the things them selves called for. Mrs. Prior chose they should go, and therefore used the go-between, though"], [79, "AN EMBASSY 67 the tokens of the mother's faithful remem brance and affection had to pass through Bennet Gray's hands.

Oh, it was not very difficult for her to transfer her right to Jack and her influence over him to another woman ! Her own thoughts were straving from Eedcot to a new home with another master than either John Prior or his son after him. Bennet drove in solitary state to Newton, her mind wandering now and then from the business which engrossed it to her first drive along that road with Jane on the November F 2"], [80, "68 BURIED DIAMONDS afternoon, and to the last coming home, in the June prime of the year, with Jack, to be soon followed by a disastrous parting. But she was never sufficiently disengaged, hopeful, and far-sighted to dream of herself as one day mistress of Eedcot driving in to Newton in a new carriage, with young horses and a young husband. The market town had resumed its normal aspect \u2014 sleepy in summer, with dogs stretched in the middle of the pavement, cats sitting basking at open doors, birds in their cages hanging by open windows \u2014 stagnant in winter, with the animal world housed and doors and windows closed tightly. However vigorously gossip might still be prevailing in the interiors, it had ceased till a more exciting moment to flow out and be demonstrative in the streets. The aristocratic quarter of the Bank House, which had been roused from its repose on the day when Crabtree's Bank stopped payment, was restored to its pristine quiet. The large"], [81, "AN EMBASSY 69 houses with the flights of broad steps to their front doors, and the pillars to their garden gates, looked as fixed in their substantial respectability and serene dignity as ever. When Bennet passed the little green, shaded by its one big elm opposite the church porch, the clock in the church tower chimed the hour with a drowsily precise monotony that added to the peace of the blue air in which white butterflies and brown bees and swallows with ringed throats went and came. Did Susie and Jack listen to the bells as they rang out at sunset and in the hush of the night ? And did they remind him of an all-seeing Judge who knew what the young man would not tell, though his silence might be dooming him and those he loved best to shame and misery ? Was Susie moved by the old familiar sound to repent of the destruction she was bringing upon her father's house, the brother's ruin she was compassing beyond the hope of redemp tion ? Susie had accustomed herself to regard"], [82, "BURIED DIAMONDS 70 these bells as among the relics of a worn-out superstition, but did the solemn, wistful rever berations awaken no lingering echo in her heart in what must be her sharp tribula tion ? The region was like itself, but its centre had undergone a melancholy transformation. The closed bank with its shuttered windows, was an image of death which gave a shock to the visitor who had not been there since the current of business was arrested at its source. The Bank House had no drawn blinds or locked doors, but it had a dead-alive, and, what was worse, a stigmatised air. The spacious, important building figured to Bennet's fancy as a ticket-of-leave house subjected to the unslumbering vigilance of the law, and to a nervous, horrified avoidance on the part of its neighbours. The man loitering at the corner was like a policeman out of uniform. There was nobody arriving or departing from the most hospitable of mansions.

Bennet followed the man, with barely time to speculate where Jack could be, and to school her heart in the near prospect of the meeting with Susie in such circumstances."], [85, "73 CHAPTER V.

There was a hush in the house \u2014 not unlike that breathless pause between the going out of a life and the committal of dust to dust \u2014 which the naturally strident voices of Molly and Piers, subdued by distance, ss they ranged the nur sery regions, did little to break. The servant Eoger, a steady, dull man of mature years, chosen for his imposing height and some talent in waiting at table, spoke in a whisper, and had a crushed, sat-upon air, as if recent events and police investigations had been too much for him. The housemaid whom Bennet passed on the landing first cast down a pair of somewhat sly eyes, as if it were impolite and unfeeling"], [86, "BURIED DIAMONDS 74 under present circumstances to look at any stranger coming to the house ; but on second thoughts the girl looked up and stared boldly. It was only the handsome governess at Eedcot, who was no more than a better sort of servant herself, with whom no great ceremony need be practised, who might even exchange meaning glances with Sarah. Lambert Crabtree was not with his wife, for wliich Bennet was thankful ; neither was Jack, for which the new-comer felt inclined to think she was thankful also. She had made up her mind beforehand that if it had been otherwise she would have bome the brunt of whatever feelings Susie might have thought fit to express, and begged to speak with the young man apart. Susie was alone, and had seemingly been doing nothing, though as a rule she was full of small occupations. She sat in the pretty, cosy room opening from her bedroom, and had been wrapped in a shawl. She must have been feeling, in spite of the warm weather, the"], [87, "AN APPEAL TO SUSIE 75 same fitful, spurious cold of which Bennet had been half conscious. As Susie rose, letting the shawl fall from her shoulders, it was seen that she was as carefullv dressed as usual, but for the second time in her hfe, she gave the im pression that she had not displayed her wonted nice judgment in the selection of colour and material. These were not becoming to her, though her dress in itself was as well thought out and finished in detail as her dresses always were. The colour was a dull blue, which did not harmonise with Susie's brunette complexion ; the stuff was soft and clinging, exposing any failure in youthful plumpness, any growing tendency to prominence in elbow and neck bones and shoidder- blades. Bennet received the same momentary shock which had struck Jack on the night of his return to England \u2014 that of a sudden meagre ness, even meanness of outline and feature, a battered, broken, furtive look about the bril liant little beauty. It somehow struck Bennet"], [88, "BURIED DIAMONDS 76 Gray, for the first time, with a sense of the un utterable pity and wretchedness of the affair where Susie Crabtree herself was concerned.

Before the notion could do more than flash across Bennet's mind, the idea was effaced by the rush of suavity and graciousness with whicli Susie received the intruder. A crushed butter fly, indeed ! This was rather a small queen winningly affable to a remote satellite. For it was not Mrs. Lambert Crabtree's cue to ac knowledge the engagement to her brother \u2014 of wliich she was quite well aware. She had also been told deliberately and advisedly by Mat"], [89, "AN APPEAL TO SUSIE 77 Crabtree of the true state of matters in refer ence to Bennet's money and to the assistance she was rendering Mr. Prior, on the ground of her engagement to his son, which she had con fessed to him, and by which she stood. But Susie preferred, for various reasons, to see in Bennet only the little Woods' governess. So long as Bennet herself did not communicate certain facts to Susie, the latter was not obliged to admit an acquaintance with a reversal of position, which, in spite of Mrs. Lambert Crab tree's well-known amiability, w7as decidedly distasteful to her. She chose to ignore the truth as long as possible. There was only a slight breach in Mrs. Crabtree's graciousness, when she stopped in the middle of her profuse declarations of plea sure at seeing Miss Gray, to ask sharply why her sister had not come. Susie went on to protest petulantly that Jane or mam-ma ought to be there to look after her, for she was in clanger of dying of laughter since the tragedy of the bank rob-"], [90, "BURIED DIAMONDS 78 bery had merged into the comedy of her and Jack being accused as the burglars. It was 'rich,' to quote Lamb, too good for anything out of Mark Twain. Susie said this with glit tering eyes fastened on Bennet's face, so that not a shade of meaning there had a chance of escaping her. ' So pleasant for you to come, dear,' Mrs. Lambert Crabtree murmured in honeyed accents, after she had established her visitor in a lounge opposite her, ' when I happen, oddly enough, to be all by myself, idle and able to entertain you.

Bennet had her own opinion of the delicate propriety of Mr. Lambert Crabtree's appearance at the opening of the Mailing town-hall, and also of the reception he was likely to meet with from his former friends if he attempted to rehearse for their benefit a haw-haw bur lesque of his misfortunes. But Susie did not wait to elicit an opinion. She wished to speak on her own account. ' I should have liked to have gone with Lamb, and seen ail the world, and made them laugh,' she added with audacious coolness, ' at having to shake hands with a burglar or burglaress \u2014 which is it, dear Miss Gray ?

' But the money was not taken, after all,' insisted Susie. ' At least, I am told it was found secreted in odd places about the house, as a jackdaw might have secreted it.

' It is doubtful if the bank is ever opened again, which is a pity, to be sure. But if a great many people are ruined, why, they are ruined, and it cannot be helped. The thing is done and cannot be undone. It will not bring the bank's credit or the people's money back, for them to persist in persecuting me and Jack.' ' It is not the people,' said Bennet, but Susie did not appear to hear or heed her. ' It was a good joke to begin with, but everybody must see it becomes tiresome when"], [95, "AN APPEAL TO SUSIE 83 it is prolonged. It is horribly inconvenient after a time to be kept at home and teased by useless questions. It is not as if we \u2014 Lamb and I \u2014 have not suffered.

We are positive paupers, dependent with our children on pap-pa and Mat Crabtree,' explained Susie in a tone of injured innocence, as if the impecuniousness she thus flaunted were an order of merit under the circumstances, a sign of integrity, and a claim to forbearance wliich could not be denied. ' I am afraid you don't understand,' said Bennet, gently enough, but with a quiver of indignation in her voice, The miserable little woman was, as Bennet had feared, impregnable in her selfishness, wdfuily blind, nearly incap able of recognising any rights or needs save her own, and therefore hopelessly disingenuous and radically dishonest.

The police, with their experience, say the crime must have been attempted by some person well acquainted with the house, probably by some inmate of it.' ' The police will say anything,' said Susie, turning away her head. ' I have always heard the Bobbies are ninnies the instant they are taken off their ordinary beat.' ' I think that statement ought to be taken with some reserve,' answered Bennet drily : ' and we have to do with several highly-trained men from Scotland Yard as well as with the local police.

This amount of information had been wrung from Jack with regard to his re maining at the Bank House in Newton in place of going out to Eedcot on the evening of his arrival from Australia. Susie winced, but recovered herself in a second. ' Well, I must say, Miss Gray,' she declared coldly, and with a little drawl, ' the interest which you are so good as to take in our family affairs carries you rather too far. If you will forgive me for mentioning it, it causes you to forget yourself, until you speak as if you were one of those martinets of lawyers of whom I was complaining. I am reduced to being unpleasant in my turn.' 'Mrs. Crabtree, you are proud of your"], [98, "BURIED DIAMONDS 86 family,' Bennet tried the appeal. ' Is it not dreadful for a Prior of Eedcot, perhaps the last representative of his name, to be in such a position ? Would it not be worth any sacrifice to save him ? ' ' I have sufficient confidence in my family,' said Susie, sinking back with half-closed eyes, 'to be satisfied that they are perfectly able 'to take care of themselves without your troubling yourself, Miss Gray.' ' I have come from your father,' said Bennet, desperately. ' Do you know he is in terrible distress ? His son, his only son, is under a criminal charge, which everybody who knows Jack, and you especially, are well aware, is totally without foundation. But, unfortunately, everybody does not know your brother, and if by any miserable misadventure there is a con viction, your father will never hold up his head again, and it will kill your mother.' Susie moved restlessly. The red spots wliich had risen on her cheeks grew more burning, her"], [99, "AN APPEAL TO SUSIE 87 lips parted, and showed the little white teeth within, as if her beautiful mouth was set in a ghastly grin, until Bennet feared to look at her. ' Eeally, Miss Gray, your interest in us tran scends everything \u2014 discretion, good-breeding, what shall I say ? But I suppose I must excuse the liberty because of the excellence of the motive.

Indeed, I was led to think that the old gentleman had come to regard his heir in the light in which many old gentlemen regard their heirs \u2014 as a ne'er-do-well from whom nothing good was to be expected.' ' You know it was very different,' cried Bennet, indignantly ; ' you know your father would have rejoiced to acknowledge his mis take, and would have been the first to relinquish it if time had been given him. You know that these unhappy misunderstandings only make matters harder to bear now.' ' Upon my word, you give me credit for more knowledge than I possess,' said Susie, with a"], [100, "BURIED DIAMONDS 88 slight supercilious gape. ' You know,' with an insolent imitation of Bennet's manner, ' that I never pretended to be anything save a simple woman, not a learned lady and female Solomon like you and Jane.

' I am their child as much as he is, and I have not brought discredit on them.' Bennet refrained by a strong force put upon herself from saying there might be two opinions on that head.

At the same time, Bennet was honestly convinced that the right course would be the best for the culprit in every way. Bennet argued with herself that men's and women's positions are not the same. A man must do and suffer on his own account. But when a woman\u2014 especially a wife and mother \u2014 is be trayed into an unlawful act, every extenuating circumstance is remembered in her favour. It is always understood that she might not have been her own mistress. Every allowance is made for the constraining, if not compelling, influence of another person, whose difficulties might have tempted him to exercise his power in an unwarrantable fashion. Bennet tried to say all this in general terms, and then sought to bring it home to her hearer. ' It is no secret now that Mr. Lambert Crabtree was deeply embarrassed. He may"], [102, "BURIED DIAMONDS 90 have thought, and made others think, that if he could tide over a particular date he would be saved.

You have simply to say it was you who unlocked the safe and took out the notes and bonds, that your brother had noohiug to do with the robbery, and knew nothing of it any more than your innocent children knew.' Bennet stopped abruptly, for Susie rose up flaming with wrath. 'I have stood a good deal from you, Miss Gray, but this is too much. I have never dreamt of asking your advice, and you volunteer an opinion that I should criminate myself in a matter with which it seems you are better acquainted than I. Bonds ? What bonds ? I never heard of them., I am unable to follow you.' The bonds had been mentioned in Susie's presence before, but she had been too excited to notice the allusion.

He announced, in a voice which had grown both hollow and wheezy of late, ' If you please, ma'am, some summer fruit from Eedcot.' . Susie was herself again before the salver could be put on the table, or Eoger could quit the room ; she clapped her hands and tripped across to take the gift. ' Oh, how charming !

As Bennet Gray descended the stairs at the Bank House, she felt too foiled and miserable to be exasperated. She was able, however, to turn over in her mind the distance to the meadows by the trout stream, and the possi bility of overtaking a solitary fisher who might have started hours before. Then she suddenly caught through a lobby window a glimpse of Jack Prior walking in the garden, and her spirits rose like quicksilver. Bennet had taken her resolution before she was at the foot of the stairs. She had a cun ning enemy to do battle with for Jack and his father, for truth and right. Bennet must"], [108, "BURIED DIAMONDS 96 engage Susie with her own weapons, and con descend to stratagem, to which Miss Gray had vowed never to demean herself again, but it was in order to vanquish the common foe. Bennet Gray was sufficiently familiar with the Bank House to know that there was a garden-door kept unlocked during the day, which, as in the case of several other garden doors in the vicinity, opened into the suburban end of the High Street leading to the church, bank, etc. She relied on entering the garden by this door without letting any member of the family, unless, perhaps, the gardener, know that she was going to take a stroll among the beds and borders. She also recollected with her natural nimbleness of mind that there was a screen of tall osiers which divided the upper and kitchen garden from the lower, which was the flower garden. The osiers were purposely intended to shut out the view of prosaic forcing frames and vulgar turnips and onions from the windows of the house. Bennet could only"], [109, "A REMONSTRANCE WITH JACK 97 trust that she might be able from the farther side of the screen to attract Jack's attention and summon him to join her. If she did not gain a hearing from him in this way, she felt assured that Susie would not permit any meeting between them which would not be brought to a speedy conclusion by her inter vention. But as luck, or, as Bennet liked better to think, Providence ruled, Jack in his aimless loitering to get rid of his time and his wretched ness had sauntered to the upper part of the garden, and was actually standing alone there, idly contemplating a sprawling cucumber. Bennet walked in, and the occupant of the path looked up, manifestly startled, and took a step forward, then remembering all, lifted his hat, made a bow \u2014 formal for Jack \u2014 and positively said \u2014 ' Good morning, Miss Gray.

But she was not to be put off with such a salutation from the young lover, who had found her in what many people would have called her obscurity, poverty, and drudgery, and been willing to throw up his prospects in order to go away and work with and for her. Bennet did what she could never have imagined herself doing, in her maidenly modesty, to mortal man \u2014 were he fortune's first favourite.

' Your mother does not like me, Jack,' she said, shaking her head. ' I thought I had won her regard when she only knew me as a schoolmistress and Jane's friend. But she cannot forgive me, and I do not deserve it, for deceiving her, after I had come between you.' ' Oh ! all that will pass,' said Jack, with the ghost of his old, cheery confidence. 'The mother is not one to bear malice long. There is no fellow going half so generous, unless it be yourself. She will be very fond of you.' ' If it were your father,' said Bennet, smiling faintly through her tears, ' I could have more faith in it.'"], [117, "A REMONSTRANCE WITH JACK 105 ' I hear you are great friends with the governor,' said Jack, brightening again. ' All right. Mat Crabtree \u2014 he is a good fellow, Mat \u2014 told me about it.

Jack, if you had only been patient and tried to understand and please him ! He is generous, too, and he has suffered so much. I am sure he has a good heart and cares for you \u2014 your mother does not care more.' Jack shrugged his shoulders slightly, but he said ' All right ' again. ' Poor old chap, I have been little help or credit to him ; but I have brought you to him also, and I hope I am not such a heartless beast as to resent my loss being his gain. I am glad of it.' There was a pause, and Jack's eye fell on a half-withered red rose which Bennet was wearing. She had forgotten it was the time of roses, but she had mechanically accepted"], [118, "BURIED DIAMONDS 106 a rose from one of the children, and fastened it in the lace of her dress. ' Will you give me that rose, Bennet ? ' he asked, putting up his hand. 'Not this half-withered thing,' she objected, covering it with her own hand. ' Sam picked it and gave it to me. It has only a quarter of an inch of stalk, and has lost half its leaves. If I had noticed, I should have taken it out and flung it away. It is not worth your having.

Then I shall venture out from behind the screen and gather for you the very finest Bank House rose.

That is not saying too much. No, Bennet,' covering her hand with his, ' this one Redcol rose, which you have worn, from you,' and he had it instantly. Jack openly accompanied Miss Gray to the Eedcot phaeton, and put her in before any portion of the public that chose to look on and say it was a shame of the Priors to throw a fine-looking, lady-like girl, such as the little Woods' governess, in the way of the reprobate Jack Prior had proved himself \u2014 a fellow as good as convicted of felony. Abduction, or any kindred crime, would be nothing to him. Had the girl no friends to look after her and take her away from Eedcot, since this was the manner in whicli the Priors made use of her? Jack could not be brought to say that he would come out to Eedcot, and Bennet knew that he would not come. She knew almost as well as if he had told her that in his own mind"], [120, "BURIED DIAMONDS 108 he thought it was not unlikely he had seen the last of his father's house, where he was born, of which he and Bennet should have been master and mistress in their turn ; he was probably bound for very different quarters \u2014 all Susie's doing.

It was incredible, but, if it could be believed, the grief of it melted rather than hardened him. Bennet was driving back full of care and sorrow. Yet the pleasure of having been with Jack had been great, the assurance of his love and that she was a comfort to him, though not in the way she wanted, very sweet.

Everything was green and luxuriant still, though the songs of the birds were well-nigh over, and the brambles were shedding their blossoms. The dim outline of a footpath, a single track, meandered up among the rocks and bushes. Mr. Prior held out his hand to lead Bennet to the higher ground. She followed him, a little surprised, but still thinking most of finishing her tale. He let her end it, then suddenly broke in, ' Look there.' She followed the direction of his eyes and hand, but saw nothing except the low-lying Ladslove meadows, with their"], [122, "BURIED DIAMONDS 110 cattle magnified in the sunny haze.

Perhaps, though you had given in, there would not have been time. The discovery of the coal might not have staved off the temptation and ruin. You could not foresee the course of events.'

In truth it was a relief for Bennet to be up and doing to the last. She was hke a man in this respect, though so womanly in others ; and she had a notion that it might be some small consolation to Jack to recognise her face with the veil of strangeness on it for the strange crowd around him.

Besides, the sight of Bennet at the decisive moment might overbalance the influence of Susie, and move Jack at last to convey to his lawyer a word on the question which chieflv implicated him.

It would save him, there was little doubt, but save him probably to be a prey to much the same scruples \u2014 morbid if one chose to call them so \u2014 which had wrecked his father's peace.

Certainly Miss Hopkins had sustained a shock when she read of the attempted robbery of Crabtree's Bank, of the failure of the bank, and, finally, that her nephew Lam bert's wife was one of the persons accused of the robbery.

Bennet had already discovered that there might be disadvantages to balance the gains of her incognito. She had to learn the lesson to a stdl greater extent presently. When Crowminster was reached, just before the opening of the court, the streets, always full at Assize times, were more crowded than usual. Among the shoals of visitors whom so extraordinary a case as the Crabtree Bank robbery brought to the town for the day, Miss Gray detected a tolerable sprinkling of the Priors' acquaintances.

It might be that not many of them \u2014 perhaps not one of the women would appear openly in the Court \u2014 stdl they were there, eagc to see from behind a screen, to hear on the earliest opportunity the scandal of the trial. Mat Crabtree relieved his mind by pointing"], [138, "BURIED DIAMONDS 126 out to Bennet Gray the thronged condition of a draper's shop opposite the Court House. 'Do you know why that man has so many county customers to day ? ' Mat inquired, sharply.

Some of these ardent students of humanity, notably a group of frisky youDg matrons, though they avoided Mat Crabtree, pounced upon Miss Gray, and detained her behind her party.

' Is it true that Mrs. Crabtree is very ill, and will not be brought into court? ' another speaker broke in.

We never liked him or could guess what Susie Prior saw in him to tempt her to marry him ; very likely her father and mother thought it a good match, which explains it. But as for Jack Prior, though nobody dreamt of such a miserable end as this comes to, it was no secret that he has been a great grief to his father, who gave him up long ago. ' You are mistaken,' said Bennet, stifling her anger and pain, but speaking stiffly and sternly, careless on her own account of the bad impression she produced on her audience.

Why, even a timid woman like his sister would brave the worst before she sought such a cowardly refuge.

But this only lasted for a time. She must control herself if she would be of any use to Mr. Prior, any comfort to Jack. Mat Crabtree got seats for his companions before he occupied his place near the counsel for the defence.

This was not easy where Miss Hopkins was concerned. She was a woman of imposing presence in every way, from her large nose with its high ridge to her habit of making audible observations on all that passed. She was certainly daunted for a second by the spectacle of the court and the consideration on whom it was to sit. ' Good heavens ! to think that Mrs. Lambert is to come in before all these men with their files of papers, and be nominally treated as though she were- the offscourings of the earth,' Miss Hopkins muttered, and subsided into meekness for a space. Unfortunately the impression was fleeting. Miss Hopkins was an independent, self-sufficing woman, and she soon began to congratulate herself that it was ' a far cry ' to the country town in which she dwelt, so that, though her cronies might read the trial in the newspapers with what gusto she could guess, it was exceedingly unlikely that any of them would be personally present on the occasion. K 2"], [144, "BURIED DIAMONDS 132 Apart from selfish considerations, Miss Hopkins had no objection to notoriety, even as the relative by marriage of county gentry, who had so grossly mismanaged their affairs that they were suspected of crime, and had come within the range of the law. She did not subdue her voice or modify the tone of her remarks in order to secure the obscurity which Bennet had been tempted to hug.

She believed she and Miss Hopkins would be fortunate if they missed forming one of the groups in an illustrated paper, the clever artist of which had been sent down expressly from the metropolis to pick up grist for the publishers' mill in scenes from the remarkable trial.

Hangings as a spectacle were exploded, except for jail officials ; but an exciting trial was still an infinitely greater treat than the most popular play could have been to these thoroughly realistic critics. Yet, to the credit of collier honour, there was hardly a representative of the miners of Kershaw present in the Court House when their master's son and daughter stood their trial.

He was an unfortunate man, who had not prospered, who was understood to be disappointed and soured by the course life had taken with him. He had reached the climax of his misfortunes in the strange lot for a man in his station, of being the father of the two prisoners at the bar, but any thought of personal dishonour in connection with him was to this day singularly inadmissible.

' I don't like to be uncharitable, but these beetle-brows and that Tartar nose and negro mouth are remarkably like what one would meet in Whitechapel, or see in Madame Tussaud's Chamber of Horrors.' ' How dare you say such things, Miss Hopkins ? ' Bennet was galled into a fierce whisper. Happily Miss Hopkins was not listening, she rarely listened when she could talk.

For the very reason of the public's over- stolid honesty, its resounding faith in the sacredness of its domestic institutions, and its hasty boisterous impulses, it was liable to blunder. It had a fine tableau presented for it to dwell upon in the little family group which, preceded by a female warder, entered the court and filed into the dock beside Jack. Susie was there in the character of an injured sufferer. She had never appeared to better advantage than in that simple black silk and cashmere frock, with the little bonnet to match, the only point of colour about her being the dove-coloured bow which formed the sole trimming to the bonnet, and the dove- coloured strings which tied it demurely"], [153, "THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRISONERS 141 under her chin. She looked lovely, patient, and pensive, a little flurried, but that was only to be expected. She glanced up and caught the eye of one of the lawyers who had dined at her table in Newton the last time the Assize was held at Crowminster, and made him a hesitating, deprecating bow. It was done with such a timid, disarming air, as if she would have said, ' I do not know the etiquette of tins place \u2014 how should I ? Forgive me if I do wrong. Perhaps a prisoner ought not to bow, and my friends may not care to acknowledge me under this dreadful cloud ; but I can only act according to my own gently-bred, womanly instincts.' There were many persons present who had not seen Mrs. Crabtree since the night of the volunteer ball. They thought her even more fascinating in the shade, drooping under the cruel stigma attached to her, than she had been in the light, in her season of triumph. There was not much to be said for Lambert"], [154, "BURIED DIAMONDS 142 Crabtree's looks. He appeared big, red, and croggle-eyed as ever \u2014 confident and hectoring as before. There was not even much to be said for the character of the bankrupt banker. His ways of doing business and of living had never, at the outset, recommended them selves to men of integrity. His sudden break up, with its ruin to hundreds of his fellow7 creatures, following hard on a long course of reckless expenditure, was only the biggest blot in a generally spotted and tarnished reputation. There was no other quality than that of doggedness shown in the manner in which he stalked after his wife. But when it was taken into consideration that he was a beaten man condemned to pay the penalty of his folly in having made ducks and drakes of a handsome inheritance ; still more, that he was there in the prisoner's dock, in a public court, of his own choice \u2014 in fact, it was by favour that he, who was under no arrest and no accusation, was permitted to occupy a chair on the other"], [155, "THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRISONERS 143 side of that wliich had been granted to his wife's weakness \u2014 the British heart softened and warmed to the man. He was there in the fulfilment of his conjugal vows, though he could have had little idea when he uttered them where they would lead him, or what they would exact from him. There were some dissentient voices where this theory was concerned. There were sceptics \u2014 where are there not sceptics ? \u2014 who alleged that Lambert Crabtree was not in the court of his own accord and to back his wife \u2014 at least not entirely so. These scorners had it that the Crown authorities had given Mr. Lambert Crabtree a quiet hint that they could not dis pense with his company ; they might want his presence before long. It was a mixture of insolent braggadocio and cunning policy on his part to put the best face on his compulsory attendance in court, and make it appear that it was in the interest of Mrs. Crabtree. As for the prosecution, the lawyers suffered him to"], [156, "BURIED DIAMONDS 144 give what colour he liked to the proceedings, and did not choose to show their cards before the time, while Mrs. Crabtree's counsel of course turned the incident to her advantage. But the main body of the audience was not of this mind. The British public has its vein of sentiment, genuine enough, if somewhat stereotyped and sugary. Lambert Crabtree was there as a proof of his trust in his wife, who had her brother on her other side, but that was not sufficient \u2014 he was her fellow-prisoner. It was for her husband, a free, unassailed man, to lend her his countenance still, to support his wife and the mother of his children, if he had a grain of affection for her or a spark of faith in her left. The man could not be a thorough paced bad fellow who fully confessed the obli gation ; and to judge by the manner iu whicli Susie leant her light weight on her husband's broad shoulder, and glanced up with her starry eyes in his red face, the tie between the couple must be of the tenderest kind."], [157, "THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRISONERS 145 The spectacle moved many a susceptible, worthy heart. There was in truth no great need for what Bennet in her bitterness told herself was the sole element wanting to over come the common sense of a gushin^ and gullible multitude, in the addition of one of ' the pledges ' of Lambert and Susie Crabtree's ' wedded love ' to make the tableau complete. After all, perhaps the presence of poor Molly and Piers, with their ungainly resemblance to their father, and their tiresome unruliness, was better in fancy than in fact. The jury were sworn. The prisoners pleadcl not guilty. The Crown prosecutor opened the case in a speech distinguished by its brevity and moderation. Evidence was led of the state in which Mr. Parsons and the junior clerks had foimd the bank when they opened it on the 20th of last June. The main-door of the bank and the door of communication between it and the Bank House were locked as usual, and presented their ordinary appearance ; VOL. III. L"], [158, "146 BURIED DIAMONDS so did the managing partners' and clerks' desks. But on going to the safe it was found open, every separate lock had been unfastened and remained with the keys in them or lying as they had been thrown down and left on the floor. On further examination it was dis covered that a private desk of Mr. Lambert Crabtree's had also been opened and stood with the key in the lock. It was in this desk he had been in the habit of keeping the various keys of the safe. He had not been accus tomed to distribute them among several respon sible clerks, according to the practice of many bankers. Mr. Parsons had a key, which had not been out of his possession, to the desk that usually contained the keys of the safe. The key found in the desk was either Mr. Lambert Crabtree's, or one similar to it. The safe was not empty. It had the amount of gold entered in the bank books, and a quantity of the Crabtree Bank notes. But there had been taken from it a sum of 7000/. in"], [159, "THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRISONERS 147 Bank of England notes, which Mr. Parsons deposed to have seen in its place the day before. The sum was above the average amount kept by a country bank which issued its own notes, but Mr. Lambert Crabtree was careful to pro vide against contingencies. Mr. Parsons was asked whether there was not a particular parcel of bonds belonging to a client of the bank's which had been kept among papers of a similar description in a compart ment of the safe. At the mere mention of the bonds, a close observer, posted up in the evidence as Bennet was. believed she detected an alarmed flicker of Lambert Crabtree's heavy eyelids and an im patient rustle of Susie's dress, while Jack sat wholly unmoved. Mr. Parsons, in answer to questions, de clared that he was aware of the existence of the Mexican 3 per Cents, and the Peruvian Bonds, and that they had been lodged in the safe. But he had not thought of them or l 2"], [160, "BURIED DIAMONDS 148 missed them on the morning of the robbery. When his attention was called to them he was prepared to swear that to the best of his belief the bonds must have been withdrawn from the safe some time before. It was not necessary that he should receive any communication with regard to their withdrawal, and he had not received any. But he had been told by Mr. Lambert Crabtree to make a fresh list of docu ments of the kind in the possession of the bank about three months previous to the robbery, and it was his opinion that these Mexican and Peruvian bonds were not then in the safe. He would swear they were there six months before, when he had gone over them in helping to make up a statement of his yearly accounts for Major Coplestone, the owner of the bonds. Mr. Parsons' disclosure with regard to the bonds excited some surprise in the court. His opinion was extracted from him not without difficulty \u2014 for he was a diffident, painfully-con scientious, elderly man \u2014 but no cross-question-"], [161, "THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRISONERS 149 ing caused him to contradict himself on any material point. While this witness was under examination, Lambert Crabtree's eyelids fell farther, and he was guilty of the slightest possible shuffle of his feet, which was masked by a second baffled irritable movement from Susie. The police gave evidence of having been called to the bank at the instance of the banker's wife, in the absence of her husband. She went with them and showed them the safe and Mi-. Lambert Crabtree's desk, which they found in the condition described by the clerks. There were no signs of violence within the bank or the Bank House, and externally none on the street side. Mrs. Lambert Crabtree had volunteered a statement, which the head officer took down. Then followed the story with which Susie had made everybody she had come across familiar. She had been awakened by unwonted and sus picious noises. She had risen in terror, and"], [162, "BURIED DIAMONDS 150 stolen out to the corridor into which her bed room opened, when her fright and delicate health had got the better of her, and she had not been conscious of what was happening for a time. On her recovery, as she found all was still she had crept back to her room and bed, and slept till her usual hour of rising next morning. In addition, Mrs. Lambert Crabtree had requested the police to accompany her to the garden. She had pointed out to them that the garden door was still locked and bolted, but that there was a ladder leaning against the lowest portion of the wall dividing the gard\u00b0n from that of the Eev. Edmund Ward \u2014 the vicar of the parish, whose garden door was often not bolted at night even during the fruit season. This piece of carelessness did a great deal to neutralise the precautions taken with regard to the outer wall of the Bank House garden. This had been purposely heightened for the security of the bank."], [163, "THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRISONERS 151 Mrs. Lambert Crabtree had also called the police's attention to the circumstance that the front windows of the Bank House, if one sup posed negligence on the part of the servants as to shutters aud ba~s, could be entered from without. She had farther reminded the guar dians of the public, whom she had done her best to help in the discharge of their duty, that the Bank House had been recently in the hands of house painters, who, in the course of their work, had been all over the premises. This part of the evidence, apart from its being shaped into questions and answers, was only got in jerky fragments, in consequence of the line pursued by Mrs. Lambert Crabtree's counsel, who tried hard to stop every second sentence as 'hearsay,' 'not admissible,' 'a breach of precedent,' &c, &c. Susie, with all her blandness, was not grate ful to her lawyer for his fidelity to her cause. She looked provoked and bored when she was thus not allowed to claim, even by proxy, the"], [164, "BURIED DIAMONDS 152 Court's sympathy in return for her courage, her sufferings, her seeking to put the police on the scent. Susie grew very pale, however, and gave a startled, scared gasp. She ceased to rest on her husband ; she sat bolt upright and listened with tingling ears as the imperturbable police officer went on with his evidence. He had examined the ladder, which was a very light one \u2014 light enough for a woman to lift to the spot on which it was planted. The spot was a garden-bed, newly dug and raked over, on which rain had fallen the previous night. The ends of the ladder merely rested on the earth, whereas if so much as a child's foot had pressed the rungs, the ends must have sunk half-an-inch in the soil, in the state in which it lay. Thomas Wilkes, the gardener, was called to corroborate the policeman's testimony. He looked anywhere rather than at his mistress, when he said that the bed on which the ladder had been resting was one he had prepared for"], [165, "THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRISONERS 153 young \u00ab plants.' The ladder was the same he had used the previous afternoon for thinning the peaches on the end wall He had put the ladder in the garden tool-house when he had done work the evening before that of the robbery, and he swore he had locked the door and taken away the key. He had only re opened the door the following morning before breakfast, when he returned to his work find ing both the tool-house door and the garden door locked as usual. When he left for break fast he had not relocked the door, as it was not locked during the day. On his return immediately after breakfast, he had been too busy seeking to frighten the sparrows from the peas to notice that the ladder was removed ; in fact, he had not gone near the tool-house. He had come back before nine, aud he had remarked Mrs. Crabtree leaving the garden and running up the flight of steps which led from the garden to the house. He remembered the incident because it had made an impression"], [166, "BURIED DIAMONDS 154 on him at the time. It was not her custom to be in the garden so early, and it had occurred to him she might have gone to look at some fuchsias she had wished taken into her jar diniere, which he had not been able to attend to the day before. A little later he had left off work in order to go into the town to attend a sale of ironmongery, at which he expected to get some garden tools at reduced prices. Before starting he had locked the garden door on account of the new paint, though it was not customary to keep the door locked during the day, and left it in the condition in which it was found by the police. In the course of Thomas Wilkes's examina tion Mrs. Lambert Crabtree recovered her composure. She did not flinch more than any woman unaccustomed to hear herself referred to in public, and constrained to listen to an unfavourable implication attached to her actions, might be excused for doing. On the contrary, she smiled faintly, and gave a slight"], [167, "THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRISONERS 155 shake of her head, as of one who would say how little even respectable old servants are to be relied on ! How their rank imaginations rim away with the foolish, ignorant dreamers, and they talk themselves into the belief of the most improbable scenes which never occurred ; especially if these scenes point to some grave offence on the part of the poor masters and mistresses. The servants of the Bank House were called in turn. Most of them gave their evidence with uneasy earnestness, much as the bank clerks had given theirs, under the daunt ing sense of the burden of suspicion which rested alike on clerks and servants, till the robbery was brought home to the real culprit. Eoger, the man, had slept out of the house in his rooms above the stables, and had very little to say, except in sundry small details which confirmed the narrative of his fellow- servants. The women had slept in their rooms at the"], [168, "156 BURIED DIAMONDS top of the house, and had heard nothing during the night. They had been first aroused by the arrival of a washerwoman who was accus tomed to come on each Wednesday morning as efrly as between four and five o'clock to assist the laundress. She was in the habit of ringing the hall-door bell, because Eoger took away the key of the area door that he might let in his boy to scour the knives before he went to school, the family not being astir on other mornings much sooner than eight o'clock. On the morning when the bank robbery was discovered the servants had been sleeping soundly. They had been kept late out of bed the night before by work connected with the volunteer ball, over which Mrs. Crabtree had presided. They had not heard the ringing of the washerwoman, until she had tried flinging up a handful of gravel, which had hit the window of one of the maids' rooms. The maid who descended to let in the applicant had been put about by finding that the key"], [169, "THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRISONERS 157 of the hall-door was not on the nail where it usually hung. She had sought for it in vain, and had summoned her fellow-servants to help her in the search without effect. In the end she and another maid-servant owned to having admitted the washerwoman by the window of the laundry, which was on the ground-floor. But they solemnly swore, as did an older and more confidential servant, that to their know ledge this window and every other window in the house had been closed and the shutters fastened over night, and that after the admission of the washerwoman the window was again shut, with the shutters bolted, and was only reopened late in the morning. Ann Smith, the washerwoman, was in Newton Infirmary labouring under congestion of the lungs, and could not appear in court ; but she had been able to make a declaration which corresponded in every important par ticular with the statement of the servants. The housemaid gave evidence that Mr."], [170, "BURIED DIAMONDS 158 John Prior had slept in the walnut-wood bed room for two nights \u2014 having arrived late on the evening before the volunteer ball, and staying till the morning after it, which was also the morning after the bank robbery. During the interval he had scarcely quitted the house. He had not attended the ball, and on the following morning he had left so early that he had gone without his breakfast. He had come into the dining-room before the servant was done cleaning it, and had given her a couple of half-crowns and a verbal message to her mistress, to be delivered when Mrs. Crabtree got up, that he was gone to Oxford. Sarah Eoberts had offered to prepare breakfast for him, but he had declined to wait for it. He had seemed restless and eager to set out. He was just gone when Mrs. Crabtree came into the room \u2014 much before her ordinary time \u2014 and expressed surprise that her brother had left so early, but added that he had no doubt expected her to sleep late on the morn-"], [171, "THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRISONERS 159 ing after a ball. Three hours later, after the robbery at the bank had been discovered and the police were in the house, the same girl went to ' do ' the room in whicli Mr. John Prior had slept. When she was moving the dressing-glass in order to dust it, she found beneath the stand, as if it had been thrust in there and forgotten, the missing key of the hall door and another key which she did not know so well \u2014 but she was told \u2014 no, she must not repeat anything she had been told. She took the keys to a fellow-servant, and finally they were given up to the police. An officer of the force spoke to receiving the keys from the servants, and proved that the one key was that of the hall-door, and the other the key of the door of communication between the bank and the Bank House. At the announcement of the keys found pushed out of sight in the room that Jack Prior had occupied, which produced a manifest sensation in the court, Bennet Gray half rose"], [172, "BURIED DIAMONDS 160 to v her feet regardless of all around her, and bent forward to look at Jack with a last piteous appeal. But he would not meet her eye, his face was set more desperately than her own, with a hopeless obduracy which seemed the only feeling that was left in him. Miss Hopkins was plucking at Bennet's sleeve. 'Did I not tell you he had done it? The hardened young scoundrel, he has not his ugly face for nothing. Poor, dear Mrs. Lambert has sacrificed herself to conceal his gmlt in vain. See, see ! We must get to her,' went on Miss Hopkins excitedly. ' We must tear our way through if necessary. No judge can have the heart to prevent us. Can't you tell she's going to faint, the tender-hearted soul ! ' And Susie did look ghastly for a second, and smelt nervously at a scent-bottle, while the full odium of the crime fell on Jack. But Bennet clutched at Miss Hopkins's mantle and held her down, addressing her in"], [173, "THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRISONERS 161 a manner which must have struck the elderly partisan as shockingly unfeeling. ' Sit still. Miss Hopkins. She will not faint.' Neither did Susie faint. She pulled herself together with steel-like tenacity, as she had done before. She went out for luncheon when she was allowed, in company with her husband and Jack, and their body guard of turnkey and warder, after the example of the judges and lawyers and those of the audience who could vacate their seats with any chance of being able to resume them. Susie came back delicately refreshed \u2014 at least she could listen with quiet attention, and without a sign of self-consciousness, when several members of the police were brought back to describe the recovery of the Bank of England notes which had been taken from the safe. At the suggestion of the London detec tives, the police had instituted a strict search over the Bank House and adjoining premises. M VOL. III."], [174, "162 BURIED DIAMONDS In the course of that night and the following morning the men found one roll of the missing notes in the water-butt, and another stitched into the mattress of Mrs. Lambert Crabtree's bed. The last piece of information made a greater impression than any that had gone before it, but Susie heard it proclaimed without doing more than open wide her great dark eyes and close firmly her small red mouth. Jack started, and turned and gazed at her as if to demand if it were all over with her and his self- destruction was useless. Lambert Crabtree's red face waxed purple, until one could fancy his teeth chattering with cold. Susie, the fragile, clinging creature, torn with conflicting emotion, was, nevertheless, when she chose to summon up her courage, the most indomitable spirit of the three. She did not so much as wince when the witness swore to finding silk in Mrs. Crabtree's work-basket in her room that matched exactly the silk with which"], [175, "THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRISONERS 163 the rip in the seam of the mattress had been re-sewed. The third roll and last of the notes had been picked up in the street, where it might have been thrown from one of the drawing room windows of the Bank House. The little packet had been secured by an early and lucky wayfarer. His luck, however, went no farther than the necessity of carrying the treasure, within twenty-four hours, to the police station, in a panic, lest the fifty-pound notes should be discovered in the possession of the finder, and he should be taken up as accessory to the bank robbery before he could explain how he came by the compromising money. The Court's working day closed at this stage of the proceedings, with the case for the prosecution not completed, and with agitating rumours circulating freely. It was said that there was still more fatal evidence behind to be brought forward at the last.

Common rumour, surely, was scarcely wanted to crush hope in the hearts of the prisoners and their friends. Guilty or innocent, their case looked nearly as bad as it could be. ' If that fine lady and her brother get off, they will have rubbed shoulders with the hulks,' was the dictum of an old judge accustomed to use out-of-date forms of speech, and by no means distinguished for prophesying smooth things. Bennet was to return to Eedcot by herself. The holding in abeyance of her real relations with the Priors, on which she had been bent, afforded her no apology, even in the eyes of Miss Hopkins, for trying to stay over the night in Crowminster and seeking to obtain an inter view with Jack. Besides, Bennet had promised to carry the news to Eedcot."], [177, "THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRISONERS 165 Mat Crabtree could not go back with Bennet. He was remaining with Miss Hopkins in the Assize town on the plea of being ready if he were needed.

Mat wrung her hand and looked into her downcast face with his own so careworn, it was with difficulty she could realise that it was the cheery scholar and squire of Haybridge who was speaking to her.

Latterly it had seemed as if he were seeking to walk his troubles down, for he was on his feet and abroad twelve hours out of the twenty four. His wife, delicate as she was, underwent the fatigue with him.

It did not even imply the ghastly dignity of a murder, merely the coarse vulgarity and gross stupidity of a theft.

She may have told Jack it was only a kind of lark wliich had so much good in it that it would enable her husband to tide over a money difficulty. Then, after Jack and she had hoaxed the authorities, as they often played mischievous tricks here long ago, and raised a hue and cry about nothing, there would be another hue and cry when the bank-notes turned up just where they had disappeared in the safe, for Jack and she would manage to put the paper back \u2014 no fear,"], [189, "BENNET'S DECLARATION 177 and the masquerading burglars would have a laugh in their sleeves.'

' It is hard upon Mat Crabtree,' said Jane, with a long heavy sigh, after a pause. ' His honourable name is dragged through the mire. The bank which his grandfather founded and his father did so much for, is irretrievably ruined \u2014 a calamity that will be talked of for half a century as \" the failure of Crabtree's Bank.\" So will the consequent blight on the neighbourhood, even without the horrid addi tion of the bank robbery at the hands of Mrs. Lambert Crabtree and her brother.

John Prior was in the central"], [191, "BENNET'S DECLARATION 179 arm-chair, his wife was seated a little behind him.

Jane was opposite, de clining to sit, her young limbs braced till they were hke iron under the necessity of standing by the hour, where she could see and hear the farthest. These were by no means the only watchers. There were loiterers along the road, some of them colliers from Kershaw in their upper world fustian's. There was a party of people in the lodge, and the house servants were gathered about the lower doors and windows more or less openly. For there was not want inff a roucdi notion that if ' Miss Susie that was ' and Mr. Jack ' got off,' there should be a wel come home, containing at least an element of triumph and rejoicing.

The window was open, everybody agreeing that the evening was warm ; but the true explanation was, that even if darkness set in the tramp of the horse's feet would still be heard coming up the avenue. All hope had long been relinquished that the trial would prove a mere form and be quashed at an early stage. It must have been dragging on through the long hours that seemed a very life-time to the family at Eedcot. The question was, What were they waiting for ? Had the end come on the first day ? Could what appeared the interminable delay be bringing back Susie and Jack, released, if not vindicated, to their friends ? Before it was too late to distinguish a carriage, there was a little half- stifled cry, ' There she is !

They could not call out ; they could only look at each other with protesting eyes. That strange paralysis which often attends on the chief crisis in a life had befallen the Priors. They saw and heard the phaeton stop, and Bennet Gray alight. They knew she was running the gauntlet of the servants' inquiring eyes, even of their irre strainable tongues, as she must have run simdar gauntlets more than once on the road. The breathless listeners heard the foot on the stairs, but no one ran out to meet and greet Bennet, and charge her to tell how the trial had gone. She came in bare-headed and bare-handed.

Then they all knew it had gone ill with Jack and Susie. Mrs. Prior did not resist, neither did she return the embrace. She said, with dry lips, ' He is found guilty ? ' ' Oh, no ! it is not so bad as that,' said Bennet, coming to herself and proceeding to tell them the whole truth before she delivered Mat Crabtree's messages.

' Oh, Bennet, his Bennet, God for ever bless you ! It is I who have been blind in my wicked jealousy ; it is you who must forgive me,' cried the poor mother, falling upon the girl's neck to weep there. But John Prior rose feebly and protested, as he had protested before, only more tenderly. ' It cannot be, my dear, you are young, you are carried away by your feelings at this moment ; you do not know what you are saying or what you are undertaking. When you are older and wiser you wdl understand better. Neither Jack nor anyone else could consent to such a terrible sacrifice.' But she would have her way. ' You and"], [200, "188 BURIED DIAMONDS he must and will consent.' She reminded him of an Englishman of rank and repute who had fallen from his high estate, fallen by his own dishonest deed, and of an English lady in his circle, his contemporary in rank and in age \u2014 which was not that of impulsive youth, but of sober, reasonable middle-age \u2014 to whom he had been engaged in marriage. She had heard when his sentence was passed, she knew that he had crossed the seas as a convict ; and the moment she could follow she had gone to him and kept her engagement by becoming his wife. The thing was no secret, and, though England was a nation of shopkeepers, it had not cried shame on the woman for her tender forgiveness and generous fidelity. Not that the cases were parallel, Bennet had only quoted this as an extreme example. She had nothing to forgive. Jack was innocent. Everyone who knew him, and many who did not know him, had suffi cient fairness and judgment to recognise that. It was clear that Bennet was in an over-"], [201, "BENNET'S DECLARA TION 189 wrought state, with which nobody could very wed cope. At last Mrs. Prior, who had begim to wait upon her, got her to eat some thing and to go to her room, on the plea that if she did not take food and try to sleep she would not be able to return to Crowminster and be in the court next day. Even then, as they passed the door of the nursery, and heard Ally stiU chattering, Miss Gray woidd go in to kiss the children and bid them good-night.

' No,' denied Mrs. Prior staunchly, ' a true man should act as Jack has acted.' ' I used to have such horrid dreams of storms and shipwrecks, after I sent him to Australia,' said Bennet again. ' I knew I should never be at peace tfll I had him back. Yet I have lived well-nigh to own that it would have been wed for him and all who loved him if he had been washed overboard some wdd dark night, and perished, while the world was still bright to him, and his faith in God and man unshaken.' Mrs. Prior bade the girl remember that Jack had stid something to look forward to and live for even when life was hardest, though he should be cut off from his family and Eed cot for many a day.

Mrs. Prior dried Bennet's tears, and, in spite of all protest, undressed the girl with Jack's mother's own hands, and kissed and blessed her, for she had taken her daughter to her heart in their extremity, and surely the fulness of the reconciliation and the extent of the adoption were thrice welcome to both, even in the sorest hours of their lives.

The lawyers would seek to establish, and would have considerable materials to their hand, that the South American bonds belonging to Major Coplestone which had not been recovered were not taken along with the Bank of England notes from the safe.

The fact that Ann Smith came in the regular course of her duty, and that her presence at so early an hour was a weekly occurrence at the Bank House, had been overlooked by one of those simple stupid blunders that frequently disarm, as if by the interposition of Providence, the elaborate precautions of the most skilful and daring of criminals. It was not pretended that these were skilful burglars, but skilled or not, they must have found themselves baffled in the attempt, and called upon to come to an immediate decision with regard to the disposal of the bank-notes taken from the safe without an opportunity to return them after the house was awake and aroused. Accordingly, some of the money was dropped into the water-butt, some was stitched into the mattress of Mrs. Crabtree's bed, and the rest was tossed from the window into the street below, without reaching the watcher on the other side of the"], [209, "THE SECOND DAY OF THE TRIAL 197 road, who had doubtless taken the alarm and made off at the noise made by the washer woman. In like manner the keys of the hall door and of the door of communication with the bank, which had been secured by the persons engaged in the robbery, could not be returned to their accustomed places, and had been found thrust under the stand of a looking-glass in a bedroom in the Bank House. That bedroom had been occupied over night and during the previous night by Mr. John Prior, who had vacated the room early on the following morn ing, when he had not waited for breakfast, before starting on a journey of several hours. Yet he had been apparently at a loss how to dispose of his time quite recently, since he had loitered for two days and nights at his sister's house without going to his home, which was within a walk or a ride, after his return from a protracted absence. This indifference might or might not be explained by the fact that, as"], [210, "BURIED DIAMONDS 198 it was well known, he was on bad terms with his father, the squire of Eedcot. There had been no plea of the young man's attendance at the volunteer ball to account for his stay at Newton. His going to the ball might have rm plied his going home first. Certainly he had not gone to the ball, and it had seemed as if he did not care to be seen during his stay at the Bank House. Mrs. Crabtree had been as early a riser as her brother on this particular morning, accord ing to the evidence of the housemaid and gardener, though the practice was not in ac cordance with her usual habits, and was not to be looked for, as she had herself remarked, on the day after a ball. Bennet had learned all this argument long before it was to be delivered from the report of Jack Prior's lawyer. She suspected that there was an additional influence at woik. She felt that the course of the case the pre vious day, and the particulars it had brought"], [211, "THE SECOND DAY OF THE TRIAL 199 to light, had revived in full the excitement of the time of the robbery and the failure. It had renewed all the animus against the Lam bert Crabtrees which had taken the place of their popularity, and was virulent and wide spread in proportion to what had been the strength and extent of the opposite feeling. Bennet was sure that the assize town was ring ing with stories comparatively fresh there of her extravagance and his irregularities and vices. Among the husband and wife's old admirers and worshippers there were doubt less few indeed who at that moment did not secretly blush for having been gulled by the pair, and were not inclined to protest against the tools ever having been really taken in or capable of entertaining the least sentiment of sincere regard for their victimisers. It was with such a couple that Jack Prior must stand or fall. Bennet, in her comparative ignorance of legal rules, had a haunting dread that Lambert"], [212, "BURIED DIAMONDS 200 Crabtree might have been arrested in the middle of the case, and might now sit with Susie and Jack in the dock \u2014 not as a devoted husband countenancing his aspersed wife, but as a fellow-prisoner, the guiltiest of the three. The dread was not confirmed by the note which was handed to her from Mat Crabtree, containing only the words ' nothing new,' or by any knowledge which could be imparted by Miss Hopkins, by whom Bennet again had a seat. But Lambert Crabtree did not come in with his wife as he had come yesterday. She entered alone, save for Jack and the officials, and, while her brother's bearing was little altered, the strange, shrunk, aged look, which had been more than once before remarked in Susie, had come over her again. The great eyes were dilated as with fright and anguish \u2014 like those of a creature at bay. There were dark lines underneath the eyes. The rich colour was altogether fled, and had left a"], [213, "THE SECOND DAY OF THE TRIAL 201 sallow olive in its place. Her very lips looked bloodless and dry \u2014 the gliding, tripping walk * 1 J \u00a3 1 V 1 If C 'was exchanged for a stumbling half run as of a hunted fugitive. Bennet glanced once towards Susie, and could not bear to look twice. She had not been five minutes in the box, when a loud, regardless ' Oh, I say ! ' from Jack, as he tried to reach his sister, and a quick movement on the part of the experienced female warder, who caught the sinking figure in her arms, showed that Susie had fainted outright. Miss Hopkins, though she screamed, was too much overpowered by her own feelings to do more, far less to 'tear' through the crowd, as she had proposed, to the aid of her niece by marriage. Happily there was no occasion. Though deprived of the support of her hus band, Mrs. Lambert Crabtree's womanly weak ness was treated with every consideration. Judges, jury, audience were ready to wait, even to hang breathless on her recovery. Indeed, Susie's fainting fit was one of those"], [214, "BURIED DIAMONDS 202 extraordinary turning points, contrary ebbs of the current, and strong reactions, which sway and master popular emotion, and are not unin fluential in directing the very course of law and justice. It was something undreamt of and marvellous to Bennet Gray to note the change that came over the spirit of the scene, even before the conviction grew and matured \u2014 not that Lambert Crabtree was arrested, but that overnight, without the knowledge of the au thorities and of his brother, the ex-banker had quitted the town, and was hastening to quit the country, never to return. How it happened exactly Bennet could never say. She was told that, even in the most favourable circumstances, Lambert Crab tree, though he had not been accused either as a principal or an accessory in the robbery, and was at liberty both before and during the trial, ought to have been under the surveillance of the Crown lawyers. He should have been de tained by them till the erid of the case in which"], [215, "THE SECOND DAY OF THE TRIAL 203 his wife was tried, which concerned him so nearly. Bennet was never sure whether there had been culpable negligence or connivance advisedly on the part of the prosecution ; whether, as in more illustrious instances, there had been a painful puzzle what was to be done with the 'high-class misdemeanant,' according to Miss Hopkins's definition. Or there might have been a vague, illogical, not strictly moral, yet common-sense, idea that, as the Bank of England notes had been recovered and Crab tree's Bank had ceased to exist, enough had been done to vindicate the outraged majesty of the law without pushing matters to the last ex tremity. Such unacknowledged anomalies and ' uncovenanted mercies ' are not absolutely un known even in countries with model Govern ments. It was by a happy precaution providing for such contingencies that not one of the 'gentlemen of the jury' was a shareholder, or so much as a depositor, in the unfortunate Crabtree's Bank, when the greatest victim of"], [216, "BURIED DIAMONDS 204 Lambert Crabtree's dishonesty sat before them with her fate to be weighed in Justice's scales. For it was not to be believed that Mrs. Lambert Crabtree, the pretty, delicate little creature on whom one day in court had worked such a grievous change, who was faint ing with the terror and disgrace of her position before the eyes of the jury \u2014 could have robbed the bank except at her husband's instigation. Yet here was she left to pay the penalty. Her deserted, miserable situation tugged more and more at the hearts of men learned and men unlearned in the law, who did not appear to waste a thought on the possible betrayal and self-abandonment of Jack Prior, sitting by his sister, in his honest, manly ugliness, more pathetic to those who could appreciate it than Susie's beauty. A quick sense of the turning of the scales caused a gleam of hope to flash across Bennet's mind. She was roused to hail fresh marvels. The counsel for the prosecution was ending"], [217, "THE SECOND DAY OF THE TRIAL 205 his case with a nameless languor, against which' he was powerless to struggle. It was bred by the vivid comprehension of a transfer of men's sympathies, wliich were now ranged on the opposite side.

She saw what the opportunity was to which she must rise, and how she must adapt herself to the new standard presented to her. She was no longer the innocent victim \u2014 she was the repentant transgressor \u2014 a touching sacrifice so complete that it was well-nigh heroic to a mistaken sense of the obedience required from a wife. She was no longer rendered calm and fearless by her husband's presence. She was bathed in tears.

All were to be eagerly re membered, seized, and acted upon by every man who had a heart in his bosom. The counsel for the defence marshalled his witnesses and arranged his points with renewed hope and spirit. He indicated delicately, but forcibly, the respectable standing and high character of the Crabtree and Prior families, with the great improbability that their ranks woidd supply common criminals.

Stress was laid on the fact that the night or morning of the robbery was the night of the volunteer bad, and the morniug after it when the town, and especially the railway station, were in a state of confusion, and little attention would be paid to arrivals and de partures. It was hardly worth calling witnesses to show it could only be by an extraordinary strain put on the circumstance that a purely domestic incident so simple and natural as the cursory visit of a brother to his sister on the return of the gentleman from a voyage to Australia, should be brought prominently for ward and dwelt upon as it had been by the counsel's learned friend. There, was, however, one direct allegation which ought to be im mediately contradicted, though Mr. John Prior's"], [220, "208 BURIED DIAMONDS counsel would dispose of it effectually. So far from Mr. John Prior being on bad terms with his father and family, Susie's counsel could furnish abundant testimony to the contrary, even after the unfounded charge had been made against the young man. The maid -servant who had admitted Jack to the Bank House on the night of his arrival in England was recalled to prove that his visit had been wholly unexpected by her mistress. No preparations had been made for it. Mrs. Lambert Crabtree was taken by surprise when she found her brother in her drawing-room. There was a general feeling, increasing in significance and weight, that the less that was said of Mr. Lambert Crabtree the better for him and everybody connected with him. But his wife's counsel condescended to produce contradictory evidence of Newtonians who, according to their own account, had been parading the streets of their native town early on the morning succeeding the volunteer ball."], [221, "THE SECOND DAY OF THE TRIAL 209 They had seen no mysterious man lurking in the shade of the trees, opposite the Bank House, hours after Mr. Lambert Crabtree had quitted the drill hall.

Yet neither was the fact lost sight of that even if the banker had been found implicated in the robbery, it did not follow that his wife was guilty. Nobody had seen Mrs. Crabtree break open the bank \u2014 one had only to look at her to be struck with the preposterousness of the accusation. True, some of the Bank of England notes taken from the safe were found stitched in the mattress of her bed, and the silk with which they were stitched corre sponded with silk found in her work-basket. But that was at the best presumptive evidence.

And after all. this was ignor ing an obvious explanation of a suspicious co incidence \u2014 namely, the similarity of much of the silk in ordinary use.

A consider able number of hours \u2014 a whole half day \u2014 had intervened, during which she had acted as most ladies in the trying circumstances would have done, she had gone with her children, in the absence of her husband, from the un pleasantness of the scene of the robbery, to her father's house at Eedcot.

On the missing bonds, of whicli so much had been made in the theory of a sufficient motive for the crime, the counsel became almost supercilious. He declined to deal with what he protested was irrelevant matter, and would say nothing with regard to a line of aronment which he considered from first to last supposititious. It was acknowledged by the prosecution that it was uncertain whether the bonds were or were not in the bank safe at the time of the robbery. Unless it could be shown that they were in the safe, which, of course, would have demolished the theory of a motive for the felony, he submitted that they ought not to have been brought into the case.

For reasons which could be easily understood and appreciated, he refrained from calling the child Piers Crab- tree to give evidence to save his mother. The lawyer contented himself with reserving the child's figure for his speech alone. It was admitted that one of Mrs. Crabtree's children had slept in her room on the night of the robbery. Now, though the sleep of childhood was proverbially sound, was it conceivable that a sane woman, projecting a burglary, would have voluntarily provoked the additional"], [225, "THE SECOND DAY OF THE TRIAL 213 peril caused by the presence of a child ? Was there a father or a mother present who could believe that, of her own choice, even the most desperate and degraded of women would commit a crime, aud secrete the fruits of her dishonesty, close to the little bed on which her innocent, unconscious child lay sleeping ? Mrs. Lambert Crabtree's fine eyes swimming in tears protested emphatically against the un natural inference. But, indeed, cleverly-selected witnesses ex amined in a masterly manner, forensic elo quence, the Judge's summing up with a leaning to mercy's side, were so much valuable stock-in-trade thrown away to induce what was in the end a foregone conclusion.

Jack Prior's counsel's opinion coincided with that of his professional brother, since Jack would stand or fad with his sister. It was idle to waste the time of the Court with a greater demonstration on young Prior's part than what was necessary in re-establishing his character as a well-liked, m the main trustworthy, fellow, not practicady disowned by his father, and in re iterating the circumstances of his position and education, with the incredibility of his em ploying them in the abetting of a palpably violent and desperate crime.

Again the Court House and its crowd seemed to rock and sway round Bennet Gray, but she was still able to meet and return one eager, half-incredulous look of relief and thank fulness from Jack as he left the dock with very much the same air that he had worn when he entered it, though people were now pressing round him to congratulate him.

When he heard that his son had gone before him fresh colour came into his cheek, and he reared his grey head and walked more erect and firmly than he had walked for many a day. He did not object to being accompanied by Bennet and Jane, particularly as Mrs. Prior, still shut up with Susie, had not heard what had happened, and it was judged best to spare her the knowledge till the danger was over, the speakers said softly, with bated breath. The bleak, blighted, ash-strewn moor was as Bennet had pictured it would look on the occasion of one of the periodical tragedies of"], [242, "BURIED DIAMONDS 230 the mine. The machinery had been standing in lifeless stillness and dumb protest after the accident, but had been hastily repaired to admit of relays of men going down to learn the extent of the injury, and to seek to rescue the sufferers. A detachment had descended the pit under Mr. Willet before Jack Prior could arrive. He had headed another company after he had been overtaken by Joe Jones, which had followed the first down the shaft before Mr. Prior and the girls came on the ground. Bennet and Jane were far from the only women present. Youth and age were alike re presented. The old-fashioned little lass who had been accustomed to carry ' father's meals ' to the pit-mouth with one hand and to lug about a baby on the other arm, was there ; so was the feeble grandmother, who rarely stirred from the warmest seat in the chimney corner, unless to go to church on the finest Sunday of the year. Widow Maxey had instinctively yoked"], [243, "JACK PRIOR DOES SOMETHING 231 her venerable horse into her cart, resumed her carter's whip, and was seated in her place of office once more. There might be other loads than coals to cart that day, and who so fit to drive them as she, who had been about Kershaw Colhery for a good score and a half of years \u2014 who had done service on the memorable day in '63 ? Every woman who was not absolutely bed-ridden had run out ; whether her men folk were in the pit or out of it, she knew they would soon be in the thick of the fray at the ominous sound. They all knew it by report, if not by personal experience, and had trodden with wild, feeble feet, jostling each other, the familiar paths from the Bows to the particular pit. The first frantic rush had died out with the smoke and dust of the catastrophe. But straggling parties of people from neighbouring villages and towns continued to hurry across the moor, brought by interest and curiosity to the spot. It was understood by those who had"], [244, "BURIED DIAMONDS 232 sufficient knowledge to form an opinion from the signs above ground that the disaster was not so bad as that of '63. The damage done to the machinery had not been great. It could be repaired in a temporary manner without loss of time. Some parts of the roof had fallen, but, it was hoped, not where the men in the pit had been at work, and not to such an extent as to offer an insuperable barrier to reaching them in time. The great dread, after the kindling of the fire-damp, was the letting loose of the choke-damp and the closing up of the air-passages. There was no loud lamentation, doing despite to the blue sky that lies behind even the smokiest pall which shrouds ' a black country,' to the dense air, still mellow in its moorland sharpness with the recent breath of summer.

The women especially, with Bennet and Jane among them, were forced to give the pit a wide berth, for none of those above groimd knew what might meet their hungry eyes when the first explorers returned with their freight and their tale. The busy group in front closed in round the pit and obscured the view to those at a little distance, so that they could not catch a glimpse of who or what had returned to the upper world. Then the tidings were circulated that it was Mr. Willet and a codier who had"], [246, "BURIED DIAMONDS 234 been down with him, and that they brought up between them one of the men who had been in the pit at the time of the accident. The pit was not on fire, but the fall of the roof had been greater than was at first supposed, and the air was bad. The searchers had got far enough to extricate this man, who had been working nearest the roadway, and were going on with their efforts to rescue the other men. But it had been necessary for Mr. Wdlet, who had become affected by the foul air to which he had been exposed for some time, to come up, while young Mr. Prior had taken his place. The news was as good as all save the most sanguine had anticipated.

The re-assurance was damped, especially to those unaccustomed to such scenes, by the condition of the next victim recovered from the mass of ruins and the stifling fumes rising from old wastes and abandoned workings. He was reduced to something carried past on a shutter, with a sheet hastily thrown over it. Bennet and Jane drew away, clenching their hands in horror, while the other women strove desperately to reach the bearers, to discover who was their burden, and if it was all over with him. The load was put down for fresh inspection by a doctor, and was not immediately taken up again.

The hurt man was Ben Ashe, and he would have been clean gone if Noah King, that hauled him to the pit-eye, had not treated him as ' gin he were a drownded man,' after the directions in the ladies' lectures. Bennet thanked the lad gratefully for his communication, but Jane broke into sobs. Bennet recognised little Nancy Jones, as she executed the long whoops of her cough in the arms of a middle-aged woman, whose heart was in the pit with her two nephews still unaccounted for there. Bennet, whose own heart was in the pit, proposed to relieve the woman for a space. And the ice which had been gathering and settling in the girl's breast, like a heavy"], [250, "BURIED DIAMONDS 238 weight at her heart, cheeking its flow of blood, melted for an instant when ' the little wench ' responded to her former nurse's greeting. 1 Your father is where Jack is,' Bennet whis pered to the unconscious child. ' They are facing life and death together for their brothers. That should make you and me good friends, Nancv.' ' Da-da, da-da, la-dy, la-dy,' babbled the child. But Jack and Joe Jones were parted. Joe had been overcome by the insidious after damp, and Jack had ordered him up to the fresh air, refusing to return with him, though the remaining seven men had been found hud dled together, all of them alive, and none so serious^ hurt as Ben Ashe. There was word of a lad who had not been come upon. He had not been reckoned among the older lads and men, and formed the tenth life in the lot.

After that Bennet wandered restlessly to Mr. Prior, and stole one of her hands into his. He wrung her hand, and continued to hold it, saying nothing.

When Jack's face, with a diabolic tint added to its grotesque plainness, rose above the lining of the pit, and it was seen that he had brought with him the last waif of the explosion, a cheer suddenly burst from the men around.

During his watch by the pit-mouth, John Prior had made every arrangement which a considerate and humane coal-owner could ac complish for the relief of the injured men, and the assistance of the other colliers who would be subjected to enforced idleness for several weeks by the accident.

MOLLY AND PIERS CRABTREE'S GUARDIANS, BY NATURE AND BY ASSUMPTION. When Susie descended from the fastness in which she had detained her mother, not a re proachful word was said to her. She was not likely to take to herself a change not alluded to which had been made in the house. ' Indeed,' she exclaimed nonchalantly, when she found that the picture of the arch-traitor had been removed from the staircase. It was sufficiently shown otherwise that silence and oblivion were to fall on the episode of the bank robbery ; and it was devoutly to be desired that Susie's plain tive jeremiad on her wasted youth and beauty, and on the trials of a too devoted wife, might come to an end as speedily as possible. Perhaps, E 2"], [256, "BURIED DIAMONDS 244 as it belonged to Susie's character to utter this jeremiad, the treatment was trying. Certainly it did not elicit any overpowering expression of gratitude. Susie was equally irresponsive to the knowledge that there was stdl a home for her and her children at Eedcot ; that neither her father in his repugnance, no, nor Jack, though he too shrank unconquerably from her \u2014 ad the more that she gave no sign of shrink ing from him \u2014 would turn her from their doors tid another refuge was found for her. Susie took it as her inalienable right that she should be in the home she had outraged and threatened to render desolate \u2014 not only in the most comfortable chair, which she quickly ap propriated, but in the place of honour, whicli she was ready audaciously to fill. In the same manner she would unhesitatingly have caded upon her mother to resume the chief of her motherly cares for her \u2014 Susie, to be the slave of her whims if she chose. But John Prior interfered and peremptorily forbade the impu-"], [257, "MOLLY AND PIERS' GUARDIANS 245 dent extortion, however gracefully made. Mrs. Prior, on her part, though she had wonderful patience and forbearance, ay, and tears of pify, which were hke drops of blood wrung from her heart, where her erring daughter was concerned. rose up after the first few days, in what, was not so much self-defence as an honest mainten ance of what was right and fit, a strong sense of what was due to her husband and her re maining children. Susie did not scruple to be mddly indignant, and to complain piteously to all who would listen to her, that even mam-ma had gone against her. Then Mrs. Lambert Crabtree condescended to make overtures on terms of equality to the late Eedcot governess, about whom the cock and-bud story that she was an heiress in dis guise had actuady turned out to be true. In addition, she had been eminently successful in her aims, though she was not to be the mistress of Haybridge. Miss Gray had the credit of"], [258, "246 BURIED DIAMONDS subduing pap-pa with her bow and spear, though when it came to that, not many elderly gentle men were wholly inaccessible to the charms of heiresses \u2014 open or disguised \u2014 as wives for their sons and heirs ! Pap-pa had chosen to announce, in the most gushing manner, at a gathering of the colliers \u2014 of all people, after an explosion of all things, that Miss Gray was to be the future mistress of Eedcot. Of course, when pap-pa had gone so far as to say that in public, even though it was a public of colliers, the family could only submit \u2014 nothing more was to be done. But Bennet, though she could not trample on a creature who was down, was inflexibly civd ; no more. From Jane there was nothing to be had save cold magnanimity. No amount of mis chief-making, however ingeniously prosecuted, would render the large-minded, large-hearted woman jealous of Jack and his coming wife. So many of Susie's vocations were gone already, it was stid harder for her to discern"], [259, "MOLLY AND PIERS' GUARDIANS 247 that, in spite of her former social sway, and notwithstanding the eclat with which, as it seemed to her, her trial had ended, the county neighbours of the Crabtrees and Priors mani festly fought shy of her \u2014 a wife with a cloud upon her, living apart from a disreputable hus band, a pensioner on the bounty of her father. Poor old John Prior ! he had been sorely tried, though this windfad of a moneyed wife, a charming, handsome, monstrously clever young lady, had turned up in the most romantic manner, in time to redeem the scapegrace Jack's chances. But as for Susie Crabtree, however cruedy she had been treated, however much she was to be felt for and lamented, with her memory tenderly cherished, as in her day the loveliest, brightest, most pleasant spoken of young matrons unequady yoked to a brute of a husband \u2014 she was stid a woman who had only escaped by the skin of her teeth from conviction in a public trial for a bank rob bery. She was no fit associate for the men's"], [260, "BURIED DIAMONDS 248 wives and daughters, however captivating and entertaining she might stdl be in casual en counters with the men themselves. Susie was to have no more good times of pre-eminence in popularity, unless she was prepared to angle for them on another and very different moral level, which could not be while she stayed at Eedcot. Susie began to droop, and to afford indica tions of becoming an interesting invalid, and so further burdening her relatives and trading on the sympathies of the world. Mat Crabtree strove manfully to accommo date himself to the checks put on his former liberality in farming enterprise and scholarly tastes by the mortgages with which Haybridge was now burdened. If they were to be wiped out in his day, they could only be got rid of by all-round retrenchment and strict economy. Nevertheless he proposed again, as he had proposed at the beginning, to take his brother's wife's children to stay for the present at Hay-"], [261, "MOLLY AND PIERS' GUARDIANS 249 bridge. But Susie knew better than to imagine that Havbridge imder existing circumstances could be preferable to Eedcot. At this juncture letters came from Lambert Crabtree. who had gone, from easdy understood reasons, to Sweden, where a former acquaint- ance of his had settled and prospered. Lambert had found an opening through this acquaint- ance, and by Mat's consenting to stint himself, in order to give his brother another start in life. Lambert was as ready to brag as ever of what were likely to be the profits of the new concern, and of the progress he had already made in winning the good graces of the leaders of Upsala society. Ad at once Susie was seized with an ardent longing to be with her husband. A wife's place was by her husband's side what- ever his faults mio-ht have been, and she would say this for her poor dear old Lamb, that he had thought nothing too good for her, and would have liked her to eat out of gold plate and wear gold tissue if she had cared to do it."], [262, "BURIED DIAMONDS 250 He would be amazed and indignant to hear how cavalierly she was treated now by her own people among others, she was sorry to say, though they might have felt for her if anybody could feel. A true wife did not mind sharing the reverses and hardships in her husband's lot. Banishment, privation ! What did she care for banishment and privation if she could but be by her poor Lamb and prove a comfort to him ? She supposed she would not die of the cold of Scandinavia. If she did, what did it signify when she was in the path of duty \u2014 a wife's duty? The loss would be Lamb's, for since their misfortunes nobody wanted her at home. It was pointed out to Mrs. Lambert Crab tree that she could not with prudence take her children to Sweden till it was seen whether their father would succeed and whether he could provide a permanent home for her and them. Here she was quite amenable to reason.

They at least would bo safe enough with their grand-parents and uncles and aunts \u2014 there was no lack of relations. The children were too young to be deeply wounded by the un kindness which had cut her to the heart \u2014 and she did not mean to say that mam-ma and Jane, not to say pap-pa and .lack and Mat. or even Miss Crav, would be guilty of inhumanity to their own near kindred in the shape of dear. innocent, helpless children.

No sooner"], [264, "BURIED DIAMONDS 252 was she fairly gone than her family, in com pany with the whole neighbourhood, were keenly sensible what an incubus had been lifted from their shoulders. Susie might re pent ; it were hard to deny her that half divine capacity of sinners which is the hope of humanity ; but it could scarcely have been among the kindred whom she still in her heart scorned with a sight hardened scorn, upon whom she would have continued to trade with self-satisfied assurance. Poor sittle Molly and Piers were left, and were likely to be left, unless they could be found of service to their parents, to the custody of other, and, it was to be hoped, more dis interested and trustworthy keepers. Mat Crabtree, coming upon their Aunt Jane with Piers in her lap and Mody at her knee, listening to their lessons, and striving to be of use to the unlucky wights, thought he had never seen Jane Prior to greater advantage. He longed not only to ted her so, but to share"], [265, "MOLLY AND PIERS' GUARDIANS 253 her task aud lighten it by sharing it, for were not the boy aud girl his nephew and niece as wed as hers, Crabtrees still more than Priors ? ' I must have the chddren to Haybridge, Jane,' he said, as he sent them to play out of hearing. ' There can be no question about that being their proper home. They have more claim upon me than upon anyone here, and I am willing enough to acknowledge the claim. A little lad and lass, growing up in the house of a solitary man, should be a boon to him, shotddn't they? Anyhow, your father and mother ought not to be troubled with the children any longer. The little Woods are enough for a nursery of a previous generation.' ' I don't think Mody and Piers bore my father and mother, Mr. Crabtreee,' said Jane, growing a shade paler, ' and I'm sure they do not bore me. I seem to have learnt experience with Ally and Sam and Tom, or Miss Gray has opened my eyes on some points,' she went on with a faint smile, ' for I get on better with"], [266, "BURIED DIAMONDS 254 Molly and Piers, now that they are my parti cular charge.

' Indeed, they are not at all bad children, though they are rather slow and a httle unruly. They are affectionate, and I think,' she added, stammer ing, and her face getting very red, ' I think they are truthful and honest.' ' I hope so,' he answered, with quick, grave emphasis.

These two wid not drift far apart again, I trust ; but an interpreter rather than a peace-maker is stdl needed be tween them sometimes. My father has a great respect for Bennet's opinion, and is inclined to think more of Jack's when the two are in j unison. \u2022 Ad the more reason you should not be cumbered with my nephew and niece, while I dwed in solitary state at Haybridge.' ' Certainly, Mr. Crabtree, you are the best entitled to the chddren.' ' My dear Jane, you don't imagine that I covet the monkeys on my own account,' pro tested Mat Crabtree ruefudy.

I know they will miss you dreadfully, and that all the good training you have been giving them for the last month or two will soon be lost.' ' I daresay,' said Jane shyly, ' your house keeper will be able to manage Molly and Piers.' 4 Not at all,' he said, shaking his head. ' My housekeeper has given in her leave. That state to which I have alluded has got too sorry for her taste, latterly. Well, I don't blame her. She has been a faithful servant, but she does not like changes, naturally. She is getting up in years, she has saved money, and she wishes to join a sister who is about to start a lodging-house at Bournemouth. It is all per fectly fair and reasonable, though I may be put about to begin with, getting used to new ways and new servants.' ' Then why don't you leave the children where they are, at least in the meantime, if that will be any relief to you ?

He got up from his seat opposite to her, and came and stood beside her, looking down at her. ' I am no longer young. I have lost sufficient money to keep me pinched in my resources, though I believe I can right myself if the time is granted to me. There is no use in saying what I might have done if all this trouble had not come upon us, particularly as even without it th e Priors might well have had enough of the Crabtrees.' Jane was silent for a moment, and even after she spoke with strong feesing she could not look at him. ' It might be put the other way \u2014 that the Crabtrees have had enough of the Priors,' she said in a low tone, her eyes cast down in morti fication and shame, even while she trembled with a very different feeling.

WHAT CAME OF THE BORE AT THE RATS' DITCH. John Prior was standing in the Dutch clover field looking down at the Eats' Ditch. It had undergone a considerable transformation since the spring day when Lambert Crabtree had found his father-in law apparently contemplat ing the gambols of Tommy and Fly, as they plunged and struggled after imaginary rats in their happy hunting ground. It was autumn \u2014 the second autumn \u2014 and there was the usual October wealth of wither ing sedges and bulrushes. Occasionally a single tuft of the blue flower of the chicory contrasted with a double row of the red berries of lords and-ladies. These again were but dull crimson"], [274, "262 BURIED DIAMONDS reflections of the purer scarlet of the big berries of the bryony ; its leaves were already russet and shrunken, festooning the hedges, and blend ing inextricably with the long green garlands and downy white seed of old-man 's-beard. There were greater alterations than those made by the annual round of the seasons. The borers had been here at last. They were not at work, for they had done their task, but their gear \u2014 windlass, ropes, rods \u2014 still stood or lay about among the heaps of rubbish and the trampled down, dug into sides of the ditch. John Prior had a perfect right to stand there. He was under no inducement to make a feint of being drawn aside by his four-footed companion. For Ladslove had been bought with Bennet Prior's money, and was her pro perty, to be united with Eedcot as the inheri tance of John Prior's grandchildren. It was by John Prior's orders, and under his personal supervision, that the dream of his sife had been realised, and coal bored for on the"], [275, "IT CAME OF THE BORE 263 spot where he had been assured that the buried diamonds lay waiting for their finder.

There was not an ounce of coal under the earth by the Eats' Ditch any more than in the other Ladslove meadows. It was only yesterday that John Prior had been driven to acquiesce in the fallacy of the besief whicli had coloured the greater part of his life, and moved the man to the centre of his being. He stood and gazed blankly at the blank before him as at the grave \u2014 the empty grave, for it"], [276, "BURIED DIAMONDS 264 had never contained a body \u2014 of his visions, ap prehensions, and reviving hopes. It was as if his loves and his hates had been alike wasted, as if one were to awake in another world and find that the chief desire and dread which had shaped the site of the past had been a mere chimera. As he stood and looked, the soft autumn day, fad of the pensiveness of over-ripeness, the morbidezza dropping to decay, which precedes the chid of the fall, he was again interrupted, but it was by a gentler intruder on his meditations this time. Instead of Lambert Crabtree, swaggering on his vicious bay \u2022 Eoosian,' Bennet Prior came quietly walk ing along the field-path, ftidowed by Tommy, picking his steps gingerly, for there had been a touch of hoar frost in the early morniug. melted by the midday sun, and Tommy had as great an objection to wetting his paws unnecessardy as a cat feels to wetting hers.
