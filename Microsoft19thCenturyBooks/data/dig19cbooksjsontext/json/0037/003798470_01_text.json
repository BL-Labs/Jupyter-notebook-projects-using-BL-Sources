In this he is already assured of much sympathy, and but for the assistance which he has received on all sides his efforts would have been of Httle worth. His greatest hope at the outset of his enterprise is, that the work may incite in many minds a thoughtful and intelligent disposition to observe, study, and reflect upon the world at our doors, and gather from these Records a warmer regard for the surrounding scenes and the people amongst whom we dwell.

I was bent upon a day's pleasure. With something of an angler's zest I had devoted the whole of a spare day to a good hard fishing among the records. There is a great resemblance between this kind of sport and the sport of the rod and line ; and when, with no impediment pre vailing, I start on such expeditions, I think I know how Piscator feels when bound for his favourite stream. Many pleasant days, spread over several years, had been already spent in that charming haunt, the Library of the British Museum ; but to-day I was to try my fortune in new pre serves. I had heard some time long ago of a sealed packet, vaguely sup posed to hold many secrets of Woolwich, somewhere hidden away, no one knew where. I had an indistinct idea that the abode of this treasure was either the United Service Institution, the Indian Museum at South Kensington, or Sir John Soane's mansion of curiosities in Lincoln's Inn Square, whose locked chambers are still to some extent concealed from mortal eye. To these I severally repaired, and in each was courteously assisted by the officials in my search. Old lumber that had scarcely seen daylight for years was dragged out and examined, books, models, and plans and drawings of all kinds were displayed, but nothing like a"], [66, "2 INTRODUCTION. revelation appeared to view. Eemembering that I had publicly adver tised this, my strong desire, on more than one occasion, and had utterly failed in its achievement, I began to despair of success, and resolved to give up the search as idle and visionary. At least I would spend the remainder of the day in the soothing atmosphere of the ever blissful British Museum. Arriving at' Bloomsbury, I was fatigued with the long morning's work, and as I passed the well-known portal I certainly never dreamed of that day netting a prize. The broad shelves with their thousands of works of reference had all been travelled over many a time and oft, and all the promising volumes probed and robbed as the bee robbeth the flowers. I suppose that the veriest tyro of the reading-room knows that the accessible shelves are only the beginning of research. But I had also thoroughly scoured the catalogues \u2014 especially the Catalogue, which itself consists of 2,000 great volumes ; and every work which seemed to bear upon the affairs of my district, or to have any connection therewith, had been duly requisitioned and studied, until I had read or referred to thousands of books and made a pretty pile of notes. Even accustomed readers, however, are slow in understanding the catalogues, and especially in penetrating far beyond the general cata- logue, where are a number of special catalogues in which are enumerated works of particular classes, not mentioned, though they ought to be, in the general catalogue. It requires a long apprenticeship to the Library to become familiar with all these sources of information, and were it not for the invariable courtesy and help of the gentlemanly officials, the poor student would often come to grief. I had previously marked down one of these special catalogues for attack, and found that it dealt exclusively with plans and diagrams in the King's Library. To-day I got it out and turned over the index pages as usual. \" Wool- wich,\" \"Plumstead,\" \"Charlton,\" \"Erith,\" \" Lesnes,\" \"Kent,\" \"Thames,\" &c, were looked for without any particular success, and then I came almost by chance upon \" Dockyards of England \u2014 South-east District.\" This looked promising, and I sent for the work. It arrived, a ponderous tome two feet square, which when opened nearly covered the ample desk allotted to the reader. Yes. Here were certainly some fish which seemed worth catch ing. But what is this ? \" Plans of Woolwich Dockyard, &c, not to be opened.\" A great packet, sealed up, how long nobody knew, and not to be opened ! The book came, as I have said, out of the King's Library, that vast and splendid treasury of books accumulated by George III. and presented to the nation by his son George IV. Thither I went, and was informed that the plans were more than"], [67, "3 INTRODUCTION. a hundred years old, and that they had been sealed up for an indefi nite period, like many others of the same kind, as a precaution of national safety, lest some adversary might see and copy them to the prejudice of Old England. To the principal librarian I pointed out that if they were so antique, they would be more likely to mislead and injure an enemy than assist him ; for the enemy would certainly fall into a trap if he expected to find things as they were a hundred years ago. And the gentleman concurred in my belief, but stated that the book was sealed by order of the Government, and that without an order from the Government it would not be opened. Denials whet desire, and I was now hankering feverishly for the forbidden fruit. I wrote an argumentative letter to the librarian, formally applying for permission to open the sealed packet, mentioning as references all the best men I could think of, including one or two War Office and Admiralty people, who could testify that I was neither a Russian nor a Soudanese. Then I handed in the letter, returned the book with the seal intact, received my voucher, and went home to wait. Next day the postman brought me word from the librarian that my application had been forwarded to the War Office, and for a whole month the War Office was debating this momentous matter, until at last a little friendly influence settled the point in my favour. An officer, who was fortunately familiar with modern Woolwich, was sent to the British Museum, and I had the extreme satisfaction of seeing the sealed packet ripped open and its contents disclosed. The first sheet which I opened was \u2014 Au exact plan of the town of Woolwich, His Majesty's Dockyard and Ropewalk, surveyed by John Barker, with a plan of the Warren as surveyed in 1748, and a view from Prince Rupert's Walk of the Royal Academy, Laboratory, &c, surveyed and drawn by John Barker, 1749. This was a real prize. Every house as it stood close upon a hundred and fifty years ago ! every garden-plot laid out according to the fancy of the dead and forgotten occupier ; and a thousand details for study, reflection, and deduction. But I hurried on, and, after passing two or three more plans, I came upon \u2014 The North Prospect of Woolwich in the County of Kent, drawn by S. & N. Buck in 1739. And two churches, cheek by jowl, on the summit of the churchyard mount !"], [68, "4 INTRODUCTION.

Such of these as have special interest, and do not repeat each other, will be found reproduced in this work, for the polite librarian had great pleasure in informing me that the Secretary of State for War had no objection to my making copies thereof, and the gentleman in charge of the map department was instructed to afford me the neces sary facilities for this purpose, which he did most heartily and thoroughly. I fancied that the British Museum people shared some of my joy at the breaking down of this ancient and useless barrier. To me a new world was opened, and it was this fortunate discovery which determined the idea I had long cherished of collating and publishing \" The Records of the Woolwich District.\" To this effort, it is needless to say, I have had to bring many other resources, the nature of which will appear as the book proceeds. It may well be supposed that the labour has not been light, but it has been deeply absorbing and pleasant, and it has been amply repaid by many strange revelations, as well as by the generous kindness and help which have met me at every step of my search. That I have been enabled to procure so many pictorial illustrations, most of them now printed for the first time, though the hands which drew them have been for gene rations past at rest, is a fact sufficient to show that my exertions have not been fruitless. These will not only elucidate the Records of Wool wich, but in a surprising manner illuminate the past ages of Plumstead, Charlton, Kidbrook, Shooters' Hill, and the whole district to which I have, in more or less degree, as will hereafter appear, extended my inquisition.

The Earliest Records. \u2014 Dealing as we are with records, rather than with speculative history, we will commence with that most respect able authority, the Domesday Book. It is true that the chronicles of Woolwich may carry us back, if but vaguely, to the earlier days of good King Alfred and Canute, when, according to the ecclesiastical authorities, there was a parish church at Woolwich under the care of the Holy Fathers of Lewisham so soon as a.d. 964. This one circum stance is almost a temptation to muse upon the probabilities of \" Wool wich under the Saxons \" or **** under the Danes,\" but there really are no evidences sufficiently reliable to be regarded as matter-of-fact re cords until after the Norman conquest. Of course there are vestiges far more ancient than the records, and folks who are minded to indulge in hypotheses may readily find materials in the relics turned up from the soil for reconstructing a picture of the Roman occupation ; should they desire to penetrate still farther, they have tumuli at Shooters' Hill and Plumstead Common as texts for chapters upon the Celts and Druids ; while the flint implements which have been picked up so often in our dry watercourses may be so many books in which to read the stories of the old Stone Age. But for the present we propose to deal so far as we can with ascertained facts and absolute proofs, and discard all inferences that are not positively indispensable. We begin, then, with the Domesday Book \u2014 that useful assessment of his kingdom made by William the Conqueror in 1086 ; Just a little over eight hundred years ago. It is, we find, erroneous in many particulars, even as an assessment book might be to-day, but it is entitled to all the rever ence which is due to age, and it claims a certain amount of reliance as an official document.

In the time of King Edward and afterwards and now it is worth seven pounds. Two brothers held this land of the King for two manors ; Goduin and Ahmard.\" Early Taxes. \u2014 With the exception of the Domesday Book, the early records are, as might be supposed, almost exclusively ecclesiastical, and these will be found hereafter properly classified. It may be stated here, however, as an evidence of the relative importance of these old villages, that a taxation for church purposes, made in 1291 by Edward I., shows the following assessments: Cherlton, \u00a35 ; Wolewich, \u00a36 13s. 4d. ; Plumstead, \u00a36 13s. 4d. ; Earheth (Erith), \u00a35 6s. 8d. Save such brief references as these, there are no literary remains to enlighten the obscurity of our local history in the early times, and all we can learn from them is that Woolwich and her neighbours were at the period of the Conquest merely rural parishes, but prosperous beyond the agricultural degree by reason of their plenteous fisheries. The rivers and the seas were always sources of man's food, and it may confidently be asserted that wherever the banks of the Thames afforded a suitable landing place there men have been located from the earliest times. Founded on Chalk. \u2014 Old Woolwich was built upon the promon tory which we now call Market Hill. It jutted out in the midst of flat marshes, for it was founded upon a solid spur of chalk which crops up * \"Bordars\" and \"villans\" are supposed to have been the tenant farmers and peasantry of the \"ville\" lands. All the authorities agree that there were never, so far as history goes, any \" villians,\" or bondsmen, in Kent. In a suit tried under Act of 30th King Edward I., the defendant pleaded that she was free, and the jury found that her father was born in Kent, whereupon judgment was given that she was free, for there were no villiens in Kent. \u2014 Robinson's \"Gavelkind,\" 351. An old song says : \u2014 Gainst Norman hosts the sons of Kent were led. Kent, known for conquest, hath for freedom bled, Freedom, envalued prize ! In freedom's cause They spurn'd the invader's arbitrary laws. William, who saw them nigh, aloud did cry, \" Kent's privileges I grant, I'll none deny.\" And thus the Conqueror confirmed the Kentish law of gavelkind. So say at least the Kentish men. t Domesday Book has a second entry with reference to Plumstead, in an enumera- tion of the church lands belonging to St. Augustine's, which had \" three bordars and four teams,\" \" six cotars and six teams,\" and an assessment of _\u00a314 Ss. 3d.

The chalk at this spot, as at all the other ancient landings on the south bank of the river, descends in the shape of a point to the stream, in which it therefore offers a dry foothold, and becomes a natural causeway which could not have been overlooked by a race of fishermen. We may therefore assume that upon this spot generations of men \u2014 Britons, Romans, Saxons, and Danes \u2014 lived their lives away, gaining a fair sustenance by land and water, their peaceful pursuits only broken by the occasional visitations of pirate invaders. Indeed, there are not wanting direct evidences in support of the assumption just made that the sites of all the towns south of the river were occupied by ancient communities of people \u2014 their villages, camps, and fortifications. Ancient Camps. \u2014 The summit of the cliff behind Woodland Ter race, at Charlton, within the northern enclosure of Hanging Wood, was another commanding position ; it was one which could never have been neglected by the crudest strategist, and, although we know not whether the terraces which we follow down the grass-grown slopes represent the intrenchments of Briton, Roman, Saxon, or Dane, there are sure proofs of the site having been occupied as a fortified camp, probably by more than one of the powers which succeeded to the soil. Similar indications, but less legible, appear in other parts of Hanging Wood, and on the various \"combes\" of Charlton, and others are to be found about Shooters' \"Hill and the chain of prominences stretching away through Plumstead and Abbey Wood to Erith. A Roman Settlement. \u2014 The authorities incline to the supposition that the camp in Hanging Wood is Roman, and remains have been Roman Vases, -dug up in the Royal Arsenal, 1S51, and now in the Royal Artillery Institution. discovered which show undoubtedly that Woolwich was a Roman settlement. In the early part of the year 1853, as some convicts were"], [81, "WOOLWICH. 11 employed in digging a drain in the Carriage Department of the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, they turned up a considerable number of vessels and bones, among which were the three vases figured in the accompany ing illustration. In the largest of these vessels were remains of human bones, and in the others ashes. Although of common material, the forms of these vases are remarkable, and denote them to be of Roman art. Unfortunately they were much injured by the picks and spades used by the convicts in opening them in the expectation of finding money in them. They were of red brick ground, with an elegant raised pattern of darker hue, the relieved portion being comparatively entire. From this discovery it has been contended that the site of the Royal Arsenal was a Roman cemetery. The remains of the vases are preserved in the Royal Artillery Institution at Woolwich. Roman Cemetery at Wickham Lane. \u2014 The more recent unearthing at Wickham Lane of a leaden coffin and skeleton, with other remains, all, beyond question, ofthe Roman epoch, emphasize the certainty of Woolwich having been the site of a Roman settlement, and, as the burial-places of that marvellous people were always placed by the roadside, we are justified in concluding that the roads adjacent to the remains here mentioned are very ancient indeed. It was in January, 1887, that workmen were digging for the foundations of new houses near the junction of King's Highway with Wickham Lane, when they came upon this leaden coffin about three feet deep, perfectly preserved in loamy soil. It contained the skeleton of a female, also perfect, in length 5 feet 6 inches, and near to it were some potsherds such as the Romans were accustomed to place with their dead. A skull and other portions of a man's skeleton, without any remnant of sarco phagus, were also lying near, and impart to the burial-place the character of a public cemetery such as the Romans established outside their cities, both in Italy and wherever they went to conquer and to colonize. The leaden coffin, which had upon the lid a border of blue beadwork such as may be seen on other specimens preserved, was, according to the best authorities, of some date between a.d. 200 and 400, and, by the light of exhaustive researches into the subject, some have assigned it distinctly to the first half of the fourth century. It has also been assumed that the deceased was a lady of rank, as only persons of wealth could afford the luxury of lead, and the accepted theory of aU the experts who investigated the matter pointed to the existence at the time of a neighbouring villa as the country residence of some senator or centurion.

Mr. W. G. Dawson, on whose land the relics were found, proposed to give them to the Museum at Maidstone, but, the coffin and contents being taken to the mortuary in the churchyard, the vicar insisted on burying them in the consecrated soil, from which, after infinite trouble, they were disinterred the following August by Mr. George Payne, of Tunbridge Wells, under a faculty from the Bishop of Rochester.

It may be noticed that there are crosses on the lid and head of the coffin. To these marks arch\u00e6ologists assign no signi ficance, but the theory has been started that they are Christian symbols. The interment, being north and south, was unquestionably pagan, and to reconcile the apparent contradiction, it is suggested that the old Roman family were secret converts to the new faith, and had roughly and clandestinely carved the crosses for conscience' sake. That the"], [83, "13 WOOLWICH. remains were Roman admits of no question. The coffin is, indeed, one of the most perfect specimens in existence. The beadmark round the edge is well preserved both in form and colour, the blue pigment or enamel being almost perfect. The articles of pottery, which are usually found in such burying-places, were dug up close by, but the heathen propitiatory coins were absent. Roman money has been found at various times by the farm labourers on the adjacent land, but, though search was made, nothing of the kind was discovered near the interments. The pottery included one good vase, probably from the old Upchurch works, which produced the finest ware in Kent ; the ruder kind were probably manufactured in the locality. The brick and tilemakers adjacent have met with frequent traces of ancient workings. The urns, &c, are in possession of Mr. Dawson. On Plumstead Common. \u2014 Of another class of burials are the ancient mounds or barrows, of which I think we have two good speci mens in the Woolwich district, the one on Plumstead Common, and the other at Shooters' Hill. The first stands, an almost shapeless hillock, out in the centre of the eastern division of the Common, beyond the Slade, and has undoubtedly proved a temptation to many genera tions of men, including the present ; for it was only a few years ago that the writer of these lines surprised the workmen of the Metro politan Board carting it away for the sake of using its loamy soil in the planting of trees around the Common. The nature of the soil, which is quite unlike the arid gravel and sand of the Common, denies the argument that this is a natural hillock, and the material was probably brought from a distance to build the earthen mausoleum of some great chieftain. A timely remonstrance addressed to the Metro politan Board saved the relic before it had lost much of its bulk, but our forefathers appear to have shown it less mercy. It has probably been opened and ransacked many times. There are depressions across it north to south, and east to west, which may either mark the lines of excavations, or show where the cross-passages of the tumulus have fallen in.

It forms part of a map of Plumstead Common drawn about 1740, and represents a party of Gentlemen Cadets at mortar practice, standing near the western end of the Common, for the range is marked \" 1,800 paces.\" Close examination and mature consideration have, however, strengthened my first belief. The character of the soil, the great breadth of the mound, its circular shape and general appearance, all combine against the assumption of its being a mere butt, although there is no doubt that, being convenient, it was put to practical use by the early artillerymen. I am convinced that it was originally the burial-place or monument of some prehistoric personage. At Shooters' Hill.\u2014 The Shooters' Hill barrow is now enclosed within the fence of Tower House, but can be seen from Shrewsbury Lane, at the corner of the footpath leading to Shrewsbury House. \"Until about 1860 there was at this spot a large uncultivated space called \" The Furze-field,\" and the mound now in question was a favourite rendezvous for picnic parties. Supposing it to be an ancient \"bury,\" of which I have no evidence beyond its external aspect, it has been much better preserved than that of Plumstead Common, and some day it may be worth while to investigate it. The position, at least, is strongly corroborative of its suspected character, for it is most prominently placed. The Name of Woolwich.\u2014 Whoever were its inhabitants, Wool wich, so far as we know, has always borne the same name, though many ways spelt; and, unlike its sisters, Plumstead and Charlton, which have numerous namesakes, Woolwich enjoys a monopoly of its cogno mination. There is indeed a corner of a parish, Wimlingswold, in Kent, north-east of Barham Downs, below Canterbury, which bears the appellation of \" Woolwich Wood ; \" but this is probably only a reflected title, as it was from this wood in the early years of the British navy that the mother dockyard of England obtained much of the timber for building her ships.* The origin and signification of the name is doubt ful and obscure. We have seen that it is called \" Hulviz \" in the Domesday Book (1086), and this has been interpreted \"The dwelling on the creek,\" but the Domesday scribe was not particular in his orthography, an accomplishment which has only quite recently come into fashion. At one time everybody spelt just as he pleased, and the different writers have rung the changes on the designation of this town in every conceivable form. But, excepting the writer of the Domesday, and one other eccentric individual who was a pioneer * In 1594 the wood was rented by Queen Elizabeth, but Her Majesty took a twenty-one years' lease of it in 1600 at \u00a35 a-year."], [85, "15 WOOLWICH. shipwright in the primitive dockyard under Henry VIII., and invented a way of his own in calling it \"Owllwiche,\" all the old authorities allowed it to begin with \" W.\" Indeed, we find that it had that initial even before the Norman Conqueror took his famous inventory, which shows conclusively that \" Hulviz \" was a corruption and must not be accepted as evidence of the primal source. Wulewic, Woldicich, and Wolwich are the earliest Anglo-Saxon read - ings. Wul stood for \"wool,\" and wold for \" wood,\" \" weald,\" \" slope,\" or \" plain.\" Wol was Anglo-Saxon for \" plague,\" \" disease,\" or \"gloom:\" thus, wolcn was a \"cloud;\" irolcyrge \"a hag;\" wolic, \"wicked;\" and woliche (our very name) \"unjustly.\" But wolde was also used for \" old : \" \u2014 And be in charitie and in accorde With all thy neighbours wolde and yung. HalliwelVs Archaic. Woldicich, therefore, may have meant \" the old village.\" Wic (Wye in Saxon), had many significations, but all denote a fixed abode or residence. Thus it meant street, village, camp, castle, house, place of work, &c. Wich, in our case a corruption of Wic, generally implies \" salt springs.\" Nothing is more reasonable to suppose than that the compiler of Domesday found the Anglo-Saxon icic and the Norman viz convert ible terms, and pardonably preferred his own tongue. The only explanation of his first syllable which I can offer is that he may have been misled by the sound, which, if we give the u a broad pronunci ation, renders \"hul\" (hool), and \"wool\" not unlike, especially when we imagine them spoken with a provincial dialect. In all I have met with thirty variations of the name Hulviz AVolwiche AVoolwych Wolkge OwUwiche Wolwych AVoollwitch AVoolwiche Walwich Wolledge Woolwicke AVoolwych Woldwich AVollewich AVoollewic AVulewic Wlewic AArollwych AVoollwitche Wulwiche Wlewich Wolnewich* Woolledge Wulewiche Wlewick AVoolich WoolUdge Woolwich Wolwich AVooledge Others might probably be added. One of the most curious of the fore going is the second example, already referred to, which seems to have come from an application of the French equivalent Ou for the initial W ; but it was nearly imitated in the address of a letter which puzzled the Post Office some few years ago : \u2014 Peter Robertson, 2 Compney 7 Batilian, Rolyl Atirian Owilige, England. * Thomas Philipot, in his \"Kent Survey\" of 1659, says :\u2014 \" Wolwich has been in elder times written Wolnewich.\" But his Etymology in the same volume declares it was \" anciently written Woldwich, that is, the turning river under the would.\""], [86, "16 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Our part in English History. \u2014 We do not find many references to Woolwich amid the historical literature of early England, but, like the rest of the county of Kent, the place seems to have had a hand in most ofthe famous insurrections. The people of Kent, especially in the Metropolitan section, were counted amongst the most cultivated as well Blackheath Hill and view of Old London, Seventeenth Century. as the most valiant of Englishmen, and it was but natural that they should have their share in all popular movements, whether for good or for evil. The Jack Cade rebellion, for instance, was not the rabble riot which is sometimes supposed. Amongst seventy-four gentlemen who were pardoned for taking part with John Cade in the rising of the Commons of Kent, in 1450, are enumerated Thomas Hethe and William Northampton, both of Woolwich, and with the latter is associated \" Richard Lovelace de Byngesdom, gentilman.\"* Those of lower order engaged in the same conspiracy who went from Woolwich were Thomas Attewode, Simon Shipton, Robert Newdegate, William Pegge, Joseph Edwyn, Robert Egell, John Frost, and Nicholas Atte Gore. From \" Plumstede\" went John Cokke and John Crabbe of Borstall, Robert Ricarde and Robert Drynker. A blank time. \u2014 We propose to deal separately with the ecclesiastical chronicles, and it is partly due to this arrangement that the infancy of Woolwich may seem barren in this history. Nearly all the events and interests of localities at that period are bound up in the Church, and it may almost be said that, prior to the reigns of the Tudors, Woolwich has no history. The world of London knew of it only as a pleasant little village, a halting place in a day's sail upon the river. The King's court at Eltham had it within its manor, and occasionally came across * In all probability ancestor of Richard Lovelace, the poet.

So little, however, was Woolwich thought of, even in the days of Elizabeth, when the nucleus of a dockyard had been established, that Lambarde, the historian and topographer of Kent, writing in 1596, does not mention it except in his schedules, although he lived close by, at Westcombe, Charlton. Machyn's Diary. \u2014 Somewhat earlier, however, we have a few notices of the place in the diary of Henry Machyn, the merchant tailor, which may be extracted in all the freshness of his early English ; \u2014 The vj. day of July, 1551, the Kynges grace (Edward VI.) rod through Grenwichye Parke into Blake heth, and my Lord of Darbe and my Lord of Warwyke, and odur lordes and knyghts and gentyllmen and trumpeters playhyng and alle the gardes in ther dobelets and ther hosse with bowes and arrowes ij and ij to-gether, and ther the Kynges grace ran at the ryng on Blake heth.

We shall have to deal elsewhere with the shipbuilding yard, and must pass on to records more directly affecting the old town. * Strype mentions that, just before his death, Sir John was divorced from his wife. t In the Calais Chronicle it is said that the Great Harry was built in 1512.

A Royal Manor. \u2014 Woolwich was from the earliest recorded times included in the Royal Manor of Eltham. In the seventh year of King Edward I. (1279), the king was declared to be Lord of Eltham and Woolwich, but in the twenty-first of Edward III. (1358), and in the sixth of Henry IV. (1405), they were pronounced one manor, and the inhabitants of Woolwich enjoyed the same privileges as those of Eltham and Mottingham. This law extended to the whole parish, but the principal estate, which covered nearly the whole parish, claimed from an early date to be considered as a separate manor,, until 1659, when an action at law resulted in a decree that it was still part of the Royal Manor of Eltham. The Manor of Southall. \u2014 The estate by which this pretension was set up was called \" the Manor of Southall or Woolwich.\" Its remnant still exists under the name of the Bowater Estate, and, until the early part of the present century, it was intact and undivided, as it had been for five hundred years.

Thus : \u2014 Gilbert de Maurisco held it in the early part of Edward the I.'s reign, about 1272. Sabina de Windefore, or Windsor, had it in 1324. The Earl of Hereford (Humphrey Bohun) was its owner prior to 1327. Sir John Pulteney died possessed of it in 1349. Thomas de Charlton and John Reveil, members of the Pulteney family, had the estate until 1374. Nicholas Lovayne, Aubrey de Vere, and others succeeded. William Chichele, youngest brother of Archbishop Chichele, held the estate about 1400. John Chichele, son of William, inherited it and it passed to Sir Thomas Knollys, who gave it in marriage with his daughter, Agnes,* to John Tattersall, 1447. Sir Ralph Hastings married Tattersall's daughter Anne and had the manor ot Woolwich. He was brother of Lord Willoughby. The Boughtonst of Burwash Court, Plumstead, came into possession of the manor somewhat later. Richard Heywood (or Heyden) purchased it of Nicholas Boughton in 1554. Christopher Heywood (or Heyden) sold it to William Gilbourne, citizen and draper, of London, in 1580. Sir Nicholas Gilbourne, son of Wifiiani, settled it on his son Henry, who died without issue, and it descended to Elizabeth, daughter of his brother, Thomas Gilbourne, Esq., of Woolwich. She married \u2014 Sir Leger Scroop, of Louth, who died involved, and an Act of Parliament relieved the widow by sale ofthe estate to \u2014 Richard Bowater, sen., mercer, and Richard Bowater, jun., linen-draper, of the City of London, in 1692, for \u00a311,800, and the nominal sum of 5s. each to the widow and her second husband, Thomas Aspin, of the Middle Temple. The estate was still entitled \" the Manor of Woolwich.\" Captain Bowater owned the property in 1795, but at that time the \"Manor of Woolwich \" was leased by the crown to Sir John Shaw and did not include this estate. Captain Varlo, Royal Marines, occupied the \" Manor House\" in 1811. It was also known as Bowater House,! and stood on the site of the Red Barracks. The estate consisted, when Tattersall (or Tattershall) had it in 1447, of two messuages (dwelling-houses and land adjoining), three toftsj 140 acres of arable, 12 acres of meadow, 24 acres of marsh, and 166 acres of wood. * Agnes was one of a remarkable family of twenty-four children. t See \" Records of Plumstead,\" &c.

He and his descendants leased the Crown rights of Eltham and Woolwich for several generations, and in 1695 he alleged in the Court of Exchequer that he was entitled to rents, fines, duties, and services due to the King, that the sum of ,\u00a33 8d., formerly paid by Mr. Boughton to the Manor of Eltham for land in Woolwich, on the south side of the town, had ceased for some time, and that the crown was likely to be disinherited. Richard Bowater disputed the claim, declaring that he knew not that the lands were in the Manor of Eltham. But the Barons of the Exchequer decreed that the estate was within the Manor, and Bowater agreed to pay \u00a33 8d. yearly rent, with thirty years' arrears. A commission was appointed in 1696 to define the boundaries of the estate, which extended from Hogg Lane (Nile Street) and the Rope Yard (Beresford Street), including a messuage called \" The Naked Boy,\"* to Collickf Lane and Woolwich Common, Little Heath, Hanging Wood, and the manor-way J parting Woolwich and Charlton level. Part of the property stretched east to the \"water course \" at Brookhill, and the boundaries compassed the whole of the town excepting the Vicar's Glebe, the King's Yard, a small portion next Plumstead, including the Warren or Royal Arsenal, and part of the river side of High Street.

In 1649 a survey had been taken, in which Woolwich is described as a member of the Manor of Eltham, but holding a separate court, and in the reign of Charles II. they were separate manors, but held together, and so conveyed in 1663. And notwithstanding the Exchequer suit, a Court Leet and Court Baron were held yearly for the Manor of Woolwich, even in Hasted's time (1778), and at the Court Leet the jury appointed \" two constables and two ale-tasters for the town and parish of Woolwich.\" Indeed the allegiance of Woolwich to Eltham was frequently disputed and ignored ; nevertheless it is certain that for ages past, down almost to our own time, the Manor of Eltham was master of Woolwich.

This series of pictures is not found in any known collection, and I believe that they were never published. But it is more than probable that two which I present, copies of the original MSS., now printed for the first time, are Nos. 1 and 4 mentioned in Sandby's advertisement. These are the \" View of Woolwich Common\" (plate vi.) at page 23, and the \" View of Woolwich from the Bowater Sandpits,\" at page 24. The \" View of Woolwich from the West,\" on page 1, is by Gas tineau, and dated 1829 ; and the sketch here given is by Schnebbelie, of Woolwich, 1800. By Schnebbelie. 1800. These two, with Sandby's, may be compared to show how little change the scene underwent in a long series of years. They also indicate the unison of artistic taste in the selection of so eligible a standpoint. All three, and two or more others which I have met with, are taken from the hill which we now ascend from the Dockyard. Coleman Street appears to have been created at the earliest period repre sented by these sketches, and probably Charles Street also. The third row of houses in Gastineau's view is apparently the west end of Powis Street, at that time regarded as part of Edward Street, from whence it sprung. The Dockyard Station. \u2014 Before the Dockyard Station was built (a.d. 1845), the great sandpit had been little used for many years \u2014"], [100, "26 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. probably not since 1806, when Mr. Bowater sold his house and grounds for the Marine Barracks \u2014 and a great pond of water had formed in the hollow. The houses in Coleman Street and King Street were at first continuous, but an opening was made by the railway to form Station Queen Street Chapel, Woolwich,, showing Part of the Site of the Dockyard Railway Station. Sketched about 1835. Road. North Kent Terrace was built at the same time, and a good deal of the hollow was filled up with borings from Blackheath tunnel. No testimony is needed beyond our own vision to identify the great hollow at the Dockyard Station with \" Mr. Bowater's Sandpits \" (the \" Sandpits at Woolwich,\" referred to by Sandby), seeing that Mr. Bowater's house stood on \" Mount Pleasant,\" just where the Red Barracks now stands, in evidence of which there are several maps and plans hereafter to appear. The Pattison Sandpit. \u2014 There were, however, sandpits at Wool wich in addition to Bowater's, and altogether the old town did a good trade in its mineral productions. At the other side of Woolwich was Mr. Pattison's pit, and the family at \"Burrage House\" were rivals in commerce with the squires of Mount Pleasant. The Arsenal Station. \u2014 Pattison's pit is now partly occupied by the Arsenal Station, and it is somewhat remarkable that the railway should have intersected both these hollows, and that each should have become the site of a station. It is probable, however, that the engi neers found them convenient on account of the levels and made their plans to fit the situation."], [101, "27 AVOOLWICH. They were anxious, no doubt, to save expense in excavating, for the cost of the tunnels and cuttings through Woolwich had been great, notwithstanding the uti lisation of the surplus earth by taking it lower down, to form the em bankment over Plum stead Marshes. Built in the Sand* pit. \u2014 Built within the Bowater pits are not only the Dockyard Sta tion, but the whole of Station Road, North Kent Grove, and North Kent Terrace. But, broader than Mr. Bo water's diggings, and scarcely less deep in Aspect of Pattison's Sandpit in 1887.

The edge of the cliff is marked by Crescent Road, and by the high garden of the Walpole Tavern, where it rises a sheer sixty feet from the end of Walpole Place. Indeed, although some of the Aspect of Pattison's Sandpit in 1887. Sketched from Walpole Place, Woolwich. roads have been artifi cially raised, the back gardens of nearly all the houses within the limits described still show the depth of the ancient sand - searching indentation. Some idea of this depth may be found by adding to the height of the cliffs the mea surement of a sunken area at the corner of Spray Street and Tay lor's Buildings, behind the railway station. At this spot the depth was probably fifty feet. Both sand and chalk were dug out, and the great ballast pits now seen near Charlton"], [102, "28 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Station may afford an approximate notion of the Pattison pits when in full swing. Burrage House. \u2014 I have been much disappointed in failing to find a view of \"Burrage House,\" full as it is of interesting associations connected with the locality. But in the plan of Woolwich made by John Barker in 1745, which we shall presently see, there is some indication of the sandpit ; and the orchard which stood between the house and Plumstead Road, and remained until the buildings disap peared about 1848, is also sketched. Reference may be likewise made to a plan of the Burrage Estate in 1801 (see Plumstead Records), which shows the position and extent of the house at that time, with a lake or pond in front. Furthermore I have the plan made in 1844, for the construction of the North Kent Railway (see Plumstead), and a plan prepared for the Woolwich Town Commissioners in 1845, both of which show the position and extent of the mansion and grounds \u2014 at that time long abandoned as a country seat, and devoted to the cultivation of juvenile Woolwich under the direction of the Rev. J. Bickerdike. Men now growing grey remember the old house and playground, and the weary days on which they \" lagged unwillingly to school,\" along the too short lane from the back entrance in Spray's Buildings. The railway took in a large part of the estate on the north side, including most of the site upon which Parry Place is built. The remainder southward is the Pattison or Burrage Estate to this day, respecting which there is much more to be said by-and-by. Charlton Pits. \u2014 To these two pits niay be added the equally extensive and probably much older pit between Woodland Terrace, Charlton, and the Lower Road. The strata, however, is at this place not sand such as is suitable for domestic uses, but soil far more valuable for other purposes, and inexpressibly interesting to the student of nature on account of the rich deposits of fossils enfolded in its manv layers. Various geologists have commented on the splendid section revealed in this cutting. This, however, must also stand over, as it will be referred to in the chapters on Charlton. Its connection with the subject under notice may be justified if necessary by quoting one of the writers of the last century, who says \u2014 At the east end of the town is a chalk-pit, which has a stratum abounding with the same extraneous fossils as that at Charlton. Plumstead Pits. \u2014 There might also be included in the category of old pits the cavernous holes at the remoter extremity of Plumstead Common, celebrated in an exciting time of modern history as \" Jacobs's sandpits.\" These furnish a peculiar loam, which is in much request"], [103, "29 AVOOLWICH. for metal casting ; but they were probably worked in the olden time for the silver sand which formed the slope of the great hills, now gnawed into in all directions. This material is very clean, and, like that of the Pattison and Bowater pits, may well have been in request when \" Sand 0 ! \" was one of the old London cries, which we see illustrated in picture-books of the period, and the old round of \u2014 \" White sand and grey sand ! AVho'll buy my white sand ? AATho'll buy my grey sand ? \" was a refrain well understanded of the people. Ships' Ballast. \u2014 It may reasonably be conjectured, although Austin aforesaid does not mention it, that a good deal of the coarser earth excavated went away in ships as ballast. There were, for in stance, many vessels coming from the North with coals to London, which would require ballast to make up deficiencies of cargo in returning, and what more natural than that they should take it from Woolwich ? For if they wanted sand there was plenty of it. It was possibly an article of merchandise for which they had a market else where, and it was easily taken on board at a safe berth in deep water. We can see on the early maps the \" Sand Quay \" which Austin refers to, marked where the Dockyard then terminated, opposite Chapel Street and just where the Dockyard steps are;* and I fancy that, before the ballast wharves at Erith and East Greenwich (Angerstein's) came into being, there was a busy ballast wharf on this spot. The Churchyard Cliff. \u2014 It is reasonable also to imagine that the cutting down of the hill on which the churchyard is now perched may in the very early days have had this same origin, for it has not been gravel for road-making that has been taken away, but sand, and sand only. There were others beside the great landowners who were interested in the sand question, for in the Home Office records we find that in 1688 and in 1694, Thomas Aspin and his wife petitioned the Com missioners of the Navy to remove a conduit for water and leaden pipes that had been placed in their ground at Woolwich during the Civil War, and hindered their digging for sand, which, as the navy is mentioned, must have been somewhere near the Dockyard. And, some what earlier, in 1666, we read that the Government was in treaty for a seventeen years' lease of two ballast wharves, two ballast pits, two lime kilns, and two tenements. It was stated that one wharf, being near the yard, was convenient for storing timber, and that the Royal Navy could be ballasted from the pits and wharves at a saving of \u00a3500 a year. * See Buck's view, page 5 (Plate IV.), and Barker's plan, page 41. C"], [104, "30 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. We are also told that all the glasshouses in London used the Woolwich sand for their work, and we find it stated that the Norwegian ships sold the ballast at home\u2014 the chalk for lime, and the sand for all sorts of uses. So much for sand. The Salmon Fishery. \u2014 But wherefore \" salmon\" ? Because the chronicles tell us that in the early days of which we have been speak ing, Woolwich was a flourishing fishing-place, and, although William the Conqueror could get no more than three pounds a-year in taxes out of the inhabitants, its salmon fishery was even in his time regarded as valuable. And not alone salmon. There is in the Rolls of Parliament a petition from \" the poor lieges of Lesnes, Plumstede, Earheth, and Woolwych,\" &c, presented to King Richard II. about 1380, pray ing his Majesty's protection against encroachments on their fishing grounds, to which the king graciously assented by ordering the nets which were complained of to be removed forthwith. Again, in the seventeenth year of the same reign (1393-4), we find the people of Woolwich and Plumstead complaining to the king of being prevented fishing in the Thames at their appointed seasons for the \" supply of the adjacent country and the City of London.\" And then a statute appears under King Richard's sign-manual, in which the fish which were the due and privilege of these same fishermen of \" Plumstede and Wool wych,\" and the rest, are described as \"troutes and saumons, pikes, roches, barbils, and other fish.\" Lord Mayor and Fishermen. \u2014 In the reign of Edward II. (1320) we learn from the ancient Letter Books of the City of London that \u2014 Master John le Fishmongere 'and others produced at the Guild Hall, before the Lord Mayor* and Aldermen, sixteen nets called kidels, taken in the Thames while under the charge of John de Pelham, fishmonger of Wolwiche, and John Godgrom of Plomsted : who said that the same kidels belonged to certain men of Plumstede, Lesnes, Berkynge, and Erhethe, who were there named ; and that the said kidels were placed in the water aforesaid, to the destruction of the small fish and salmon, &c. It was therefore judged by the said Mayor and Aldermen that the kidels should be burnt, and that the said fishmongers, on the peril which awaits'them, should not commit the like offence again. The lawful measure of the meshes of Thames nets at this time was two inches from one knot to the next nearest knot.\" The Holy Friars. \u2014 Our neighbours the monks not alone used nets too fine in the mesh, but seem to have resorted to other sharp practices for catching more than their share of the fish. * The Lord Mayor of London had jurisdiction as far as Gravesend. \u2014 Stow, 1720."], [105, "WOOLWICH. 31 In 1313, according to a letter in Latin preserved among the archives of Edward II., a certain kidel belonging to the Abbot of Lesnes was found in the course of the banks of the Thames, opposite the Abbey of Lesnes, and brought before the Mayor and Aldermen of London and adjudged to be burnt, such net being \" too narrow in the meshes, and insufficient for fishing, to the undoing of the banks of the said river, and to the loss of the whole city, and of the people resorting thereto.\" All such kidels and dams thrown up in the river to entrap the fish were pronounced contrary to the Great Charter of the Liberties of the People of England. Condemned and Burnt.\u2014 On October 28th, 1344, a net called a \" codnet \" was taken on the Thames from \" Robert Pesok of Plumstede,\" and brought before the Mayor and Aldermen of London at Guildhall, when six fishmongers on oath declared such net to be unlawful and false, and it was ordered to be burnt \" near the Stone Cross in the high street of Chepe.\" A Fishing Tumult\u2014 Henry IV. ascended the throne in 1399, and the Woolwich fishermen continued to figure under his regime. In the Guildhall White Book it is written in Norman French that a sub conservator of the Thames, named Bonar, seized sixteen nets belonging to the fishermen of Woolwich, Erith, and Barking, because the meshes of the nets were not according to the statutory limit of two inches from knot to knot. This Bonar made a complaint before the Court at West minster that the fishermen had followed and assailed him, and threatened to take their nets again and do him violence, by which the majesty of the law had been affronted, and the offenders placed in grievous peril. On the 21st of February, in the seventh year of King Henry IV. (1406), the ringleaders were taken before the Court at Westminster, and were found guilty, to their great dismay ; but the Archbishop of Canterbury interceded for them, and they were pardoned by the Lord Mayor, who furthermore gave them back their nets \"with his own hands.\" Big* Fish. \u2014 Of a certainty there was other fish than salmon. Those curious old pamphlets which were the progenitors of the daily papers tell us that \u2014 On the 13th August, 1627, a fish called a grampus, of 10 yards long, about 5 feet high, and of the Uke breadth, was shot with musketts and taken near Woolwich. And a little later we have the \u2014 Relation of a terrible monster taken by a fisherman neere Wollage, July the 15, 1642, the shape whereof is like a toad, but that which makes it a monster is that it hath hands with fingers and is chested like a man, being neere five foot long and three foot over, the thicknesse of an ordinary man. Friday morning, between 4 and 5 of the clock in the morning, a little above Wollage, one Thomas West casting his"], [106, "32 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. net upon the comming in of the tide for salmon, upon drawing in of the net, he sees in the net a fiend, not a fish. ... It was brought on shore alive, and a butcher's wife who saw it started with a shriek, crying, Oh, the devill in the shape of a great fish ! swoonded, and was faine to be carried out. Never any of this strange kind hath beene seene by any age before. Histories do with constant consent maintain that all unusual births on sea or on land have been the harbingers of tumults and desolation. God in his mercy grant that this ugly monster may not for our sins prove the like to us. There is much more of the same sort, concluding with a solemn prayer of a strong Conservative flavour. The monster was probably an octopus. There are several records of whales of as much as fifty feet long being captured above Woolwich, at which spot the water was at high tide salt. In the year just quoted (1642), there appears to have been three of these visitors in company, for the chronicle proclaims \u2014 Newes from Gravesend and Greenwich, being an exact and most faithful Relation of 2 miraculous and monstrous Fishes, first descovered in Rainham Creek \"and after wards pursued by fishermen in the Thames, and the biggest killed and boiled for oil at Gravesend, the other at Greenwich, which was one and twenty feet in length and six feet over, and likewise a less than either made its escape to the sea again. But the lesser kinds of fish were probably of most value as regular prey. Pennant, in his \" Journey to the Isle of Wight,\" writing of Woolwich in 1801 says \u2014 Sprats come up the river in November in great numbers, continue till March, and are a great relief to the poor. They are constantly followed by the speckled grebe, called here the sprat loon, from their feeding on that fish. The great sepia is very frequent where the salt water reaches, and is found of a considerable size. From these records, then, we learn that sand and salmon were of pecu liar interest to the people of Woolwich hundreds of years ago, especially before a more solid industry arose in the establishment of a Royal Dockyard."], [107, ""], [108, "(To face Page 33.) View of Woolwich in 1GU2. By Jonas Moore. PLATE VII."], [109, "CHAPTER IV. GROWTH. An old Picture. \u2014 I may now introduce that which I believe to be the earliest view of Woolwich in existence, not reckoning for the moment a sketch of the Thames made for Queen Elizabeth. The drawing on the opposite page is by Jonas Moore, Surveyor of Ordnance in 1662, and although a little indistinct, is undoubtedly accurate. The church shown is, of course, the predecessor of the present edifice, and I wish the reader to observe that the high road runs close to the water's edge under the churchyard cliff, with guard-posts along the beach. This part of the road, which is followed by the tramway between High Street and Church Street, is still called \" Dockrails.\" There appears also to have been a wharf and public way along the front of the old town to some distance from this point, and the trees which formed \" The Grove \" leading past the old Rectory are clearly shown. A few items of local history saved from this period may be read in connection with this interesting view."], [110, "34 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. The Civil War. \u2014 The previous twenty years had covered the range of the Civil War, in which Kent took a prominent and early part. It was reported to the House of Commons on May 26, 1648, that the rebels had advanced as far as Greenwich and Deptford, plundering the houses of members of Parliament on the way, and that Woolwich had also been threatened. \" Some well affected members of the House, who had taken care to remove the ordnance and ammunition from Woolwich to the Tower,\" had the thanks of the House given them for their good service. \u2014 Historical Collectioiis. There were afterwards skirmishes at Crayford, Wrotham, Maidstone, and other parts of Kent, to which county at first the rising was mainly confined. Some of the river watermen and apprentices at Green wich, Woolwich, and Gravesend, who were known to be engaged in it, were at once disfranchised. The movement soon spread into Essex, and the rest is well-known history which need not be repeated here. The King's Deer. \u2014 Of the unfortunate Charles I. it may, how ever, be mentioned that among the state papers of his reign appears an order, dated 1638, forbidding the inhabitants of Woolwich, &c, to hunt certain of the king's deer which may have gone astray. \" Any persons offending herein to have their dogs, guns, and crossbows seized, and their names reported.\" Master William Barnes. \u2014 Under date of 1642, we have a vivid illustration of that unhappy period. It appears in a pamphlet entitled : \" A true and perfect relation of the seizing the house of one Master William Barnes, a Cavalier,\" of course by a \"Roundhead.\" Amongst the rest of the worth)** captaines and officers of this famous Parliamentary Army, one Captaine Willoughby, sometimes a sea-captaine, in the County of Kent, having a compan}' of volunteers to the number of one hundred, well affected and stout youngsters, whom he exercised at Gravesend till they were somewhat exiert in their arms, and then, desirous to try what good service he could do his king, the Parliament, and his countrey, set forth from Gravesend on Thursday last, and with leisure arrived at Eariffe, where he with his company lodged that night, and the next day came to Wollage upon the Thames, where, having spent some time with his company, notice was given him that in the Ship-carpenters' yard, commonly called the Wood-yard at Wollage, there was the score and fifteen peeces of ordnance which were intended very suddenly privately to be shipped and conveyed to Newcastle for His Majesties service, upon which the said Captaine Willoughby, with his company compleatly armed, marched into the said yard, and there in the name of the Parliament seized the said peeces for the use and service of his Majesty and the Parliament, no opposi- tion being made or attempted, saving that one Mr. William Barnes, a. gentleman that lived about a quarter of a mile from the towne, said to some of the souldiers, their captaine and they did more than they could answer when time should serve, that they would be called to an account for what they did, which, being reported to the captaine, he inquired what gentleman he was, which being declared to iiim he caused"], [111, "35 WOOLWICH. him to be apprehended, and took order for the securing the peeces till his return, and took about forty of his souldiers with him and went to the house of the said Barnes, which he searched very strictly, but could find nothing to their purpose. Then went they to the stable (one of the souldiers perceiving the said Barnes his eye to be alwayes towards the stable) to see what horses he had fit for service, but finding none at all, asked the said Barnes if hee had not hid any money or plate in any place private, who answered, curse him and sinke Mm no, upon which as they were depart ing, the souldier that viewed the Gentleman's eyes said hee would take up a planke of the floore before he went, and taking up the same pitched a sticke in the ground and it stuck in ; whereupon they called for a spade and digged about a spit deepe, and cut off a peece of leather of a trunke which they tooke up filled with plate, which they conceived could not bee lesse worth than one thousand pounds ; upon which they digged deeper and found another trunke, in which was many popish bookes, a cope, surplice, beads, and priest's garments, which they seized and brought to Wollage, and forthwith shipped the peeces of ordnance, and with a guard sent them to the Tower, and the rest of the souldiers with the Captaine tooke boate and crossed the water to Blackwall where, about eight of the clocke at night, they cloaked one of the souldiers in the priest's attire and with one of the bookes in his hand by torch light on foot came to the Tower, which, if they had daylight, intended to have come to the Parliament, but being late staid all night at the Tower, and this morning sent to know the Parliament's pleasure, what should be done with the peeces and plate and with the said Barnes, which they Apprehended, where they continue expect ing Parliament's Answer concerning the same. Thus we yet see and feele the goodnesse of Almighty God in bringing to light from day to day the secret plots and endeavours of the adversaries to his true religion, and the peace of their countrey, which God of his mercy still prosper in the hands of his servants. Ship-money. \u2014 While the national discontent was fermenting, our own records were not wanting in evidences. The obnoxious system of taxation known as \" ship-money \" was in operation, and in the year 1634 an assessment was made on all the maritime places between Westminster and Gravesend by virtue of a writ from Charles I., under the Great Seal, \" for setting forth a ship of 500 tons burthen.\" Deptford was charged \u00a343 6s. 5d. ; Greenwich, \u00a3124 4s. lOd. ; Plumstead, \u00a35 5s. 9d. ; Woolwich, \u00a314 15s. 6d. ; and Charlton, \u00a313 10s. 8d. Woolwich was getting on. In addition to ranking as a maritime place, the town had now been classed as a seaport. It is not only so described in the Index Villar is of 1690, but it is further shown that the parish then contained the seats of at least three gentlemen. Pepys at Woolwich. \u2014 Samuel Pepys, whose diary I quote more fully in another place, has one or two references to the Woolwich of his day, which are well-nigh inexplicable. The following he writes under date of \u2014 \" Feb. 27, 1666. To the Dockyard, and went into Mr. Pett's, and there he did present me with a Japan cane with a silver head, and his wife sent me a ring with a Wool- wich stone, now in much request.\""], [112, "36 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Perhaps we shall some day learn what was a \" Woolwich stone.\" Furthermore, Pepys talks of \" the old woman of Woolwich,\" whose story greatly amused him. We shall be glad to hear who she was and what was her story. Woolwich must have been a pleasant country resort for Londoners only two hundred years ago, when Mr. Pepys could write \u2014 \" 28 May, 1667. My wife away down with Jane and Wm. Hewer to Woolwich, in order to a little ayre and to lie there to-night, and so to gather Maydew to-morrow morning, which Mrs. Turner hath taught her is the only thing in the world to wash her face with ; and I am contented with it.\" The house in which Mrs. Pepys slept was in the Dockyard. Woolwich Coinage. \u2014 In the middle of the seventeenth century, Woolwich, like other towns, issued its own coinage, and there are several 1.

They were legal tender during the Common wealth, and, although designed according to the fancy of the owners, were very similar in character throughout the country. They usually bore the initials of the husband and wife, as in the instances here depicted, which are of exact size. The coins represented are, with only one exception, the whole of the Woolwich coins known to exist.* In comparison with other Kentish towns Woolwich has a small collection. No. 1 is the onlv known example of Lodwick Poole's farthing; it has only recently been discovered, and is now published for the first time. No. 3 is also a rare farthing, and has been brought to my knowledge by Mr. A. H. Baldwin, of Plumstead. No. 4 is not distinct as to the name of the issuer, which maybe either \"Bouter,\" \" Bowter,\" or \"Boyter.\" The token of which I have been unable to obtain a copy is a farthing inscribed \u2014 Obverse. \u2014 \" At the Barber's Pole,\" and pair of Scales, Reverse.\u2014\" In Woolledge, 1656. W. I. F.\" Later Tokens. \u2014 Mr. George Baker tells me of a later Woolwich currency. He and his father before him hav,e a connection with the Royal Arsenal which goes back to the very beginning of this century, and it was from his father he learnt the history of this peculiar local coinage. The date is about 1820, and the occasion was the dilatory system of paying the Government workmen which prevailed even down to that recent period. The wages were usually paid once a month, and then in \u00a31 notes, the consequence of which was a prevalence of credit to an extent of which we can hardly have full conception. It is almost needless to say that this condition of things placed the unfortunate customer at the mercy of the shopkeepers; and some ofthe latter, not content with exacting enormous profits on their goods, insisted when ever they changed a note on giving a good proportion of their own small cash \u2014 copper pence or tokens which only they and those in league with them would afterwards accept. This imposition became at length so intolerable that, when the Marquis of Anglesea was Master-General his attention was called to it by (it is said) a workman showing to him a double handful of the wretched coins, and he speedily introduced a better method of paying wages. This nearly ruined the truck-shops, for the tokens all came in and had to be melted down for old copper. If they were coins of recognisable shape it is rather remarkable that none of them are preserved, but they were probably mere bits of metal, rudely stamped and not likely to be treasured up. The last Woolwich Coinage. \u2014 A still more modern Woolwich * From Charlton and Plumstead we have not one."], [114, "38 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. coin, and I believe the very latest issued, is in my possession, and there are doubtless many other specimens extant. It is a farthing, well struck, in copper, and thus engraved : Obverse. \u2014 The head of Queen Victoria, surrounded by the words, \"Royal Artillery Canteen, Woolwich.\" Reverse. \u2014 A field gun, and \"Gregory Browne, Wine, Malt Liquor, and Provision Merchant.\" The coin is undated, but Mr. Gregory Browne kept the Canteen in the Royal Artillery Barracks at Woolwich about 1850, and the Camp Canteen for many years after the military went into trading on their own account. Trade Signs. \u2014 Reverting to the old coins just depicted, it will be observed that there were either two houses with the sign of the Carpenters' Arms, or that the Carpenters' Arms must have changed tenants between 1650 and 1666 \u2014 an interval of stirring events which changed many things. These tokens were prohibited in 1672, and we cannot trace the position of any house from which they issued. It should be noted, however, that at the period when such coins were current a house sign did not necessarily, as now, denote a tavern. Most shopkeepers and tradesmen had signs to their houses, generally denoting the occupation followed, but not always, for it frequently happened that a house altered its business character without disturbing its sign, and the symbol of the carpenter has done duty for a hairdresser or a tailor. Inns of Antiquity. \u2014 Nevertheless, although signs do not always represent places of entertainment, it is certain that many taverns which in that day existed have now no place amongst us. The oldest tavern in Woolwich at the present time I believe to be the \" Bell,\" at Bell Watergate, not only from its position at the very source of the town, but from the fact of its mention as long ago as 1655.* Where the Cage stood. \u2014 In excavating for the foundations of St. Saviour's Schools in 1873, two pewter pots were found, the spot being just under the site ofthe ancient cage, at the north end of Ropeyard Rails. They were inscribed : \" Mary Hogg, at Ye Bull Head in Wool wich, 1726.\" We can only conjecture that the Bull's Head was an inn which stood close by. The Corner of Warren Lane. \u2014 The sketch here given represents a house which stood at the corner of Warren Lane in 1850. Tradition, its appearance, and its position declared it to have been formerly a house of entertainment, and one could well believe the legend which told of its ancient importance as a resting stage for London travellers. The * See note * at page 43."], [115, "39 WOOLWICH. locality, we must not forget, was not of the same character as now. This very house was in 1815 the shop of the leading baker of the place, and nearly all the business of the town was centred there, the fashion able bootmaker patronised by the officers and ladies of the garrison being located close by in Hardens Lane. But, as the town extended, the new growth withered the old, and, as the neighbourhood of Warren Lane decayed, the whilom inn and bakery descended to the status of a common lodging-house for poor travellers. It was known, I believe, Old Tavern at tlie Comer of Warren Lane, Woolwich, 1850. in its latter days as \" Jacob's Ladder,\" consequent upon its interminable staircases. The old house was pulled down some years since and the ground upon which it stood enclosed within the extension of Messrs. Kirk and Randall's works. Woolwich in 1748. \u2014 I have already mentioned Mr. John Barker, the highly skilled and painstaking draughtsman, who lived at Wool wich in 1748, and has placed us under such deep obligations. The most valuable of the records which he has left us is the plan show ing in careful detail the whole of the area which the houses then covered a hundred and forty years ago. This plan has been carefully copied for this work, and in order that the scale may be adequate, I have spread it over two pages, the first containing the eastern, and the second the western, division of the town. Old East Woolwich. \u2014 It is almost impossible to exhaust the interest which may be derived from these drawings by an intelligent inhabitant. We see that the whole of the houses which the town could boast were in the line* through Church Street, High Street, and * Seymour in his Survey of Kent (1776) says : \"The town, from the Dock to the Warren, consists of one street, nearly a mile in length. The whole place is taken up by the works erected for the naval service.\""], [116, "G. Harden's Lane. H. Fletcher's Lane. I. Old Market House. K. Goldsmiths' Almshouses. L. Old Orchard. M.

From Green's End there were but two roads, Love Lane and Cbolick* Lane (now Mill Lane), part of which was renamed \" New Road,\" when it was cut through into Plumstead Road about 1780. Round about New Road. \u2014 Taking the plan in detail, and com mencing at the top of the eastern section, we find (v) Cholic Lane, and (u) Love Lane, forming the corner which is now faced by the Fortune of War Tavern in New Road. Mr. Pattison's sandpits (b), cover all the area surrounding the Arsenal Railway Station, and extend to Plumstead Road, where the entrance gateway occupied the site of the Mortar Tavern. The stream from Brook Hill Road to Shooters' Hill passed in an open watercourse across the Plumstead Road, and there was a little foot-bridge opposite the spot where the Arsenal Chapel stands. f Only a portion of the great sand and chalk pits already described are here seen, but down Plumstead Road (beyond t), is the circular fence enclosing the entrance to Burwash Court, afterwards Bur rage House \u2014 the parent of Burrage Town. Tbe lane which led to the farmbuildings and subsequently became Burrage Road, is shown a little farther east ward. The houses which were afterwards removed by the Government for the purpose of forming Beresford Square are also very clearly defined. The Royal Arsenal. \u2014 The Arsenal consisted of the Laboratory, Dial and Carriage Squares, with the old Gun Foundry, the Academy, and the Artillery Barracks, Rupert's Walk, and the remains of the old moat. The practice-butt is also seen, and there are evidences of a gravel pit, relic of the waste which the Warren once was. The circles probably represent ornamental basins or fountains, excepting the small one near the Academy (7) which stands for Rupert's Tower. The gate of the Arsenal was considerably recessed ; it was about fifty yards west of its present position and very narrow. The Ropeyard occupied the site of Beresford Street, and the origin of Ropeyard Rails is self-evident. We have seen that Cannon Row (e) was called Ragged Row, and the Arsenal was apparently walled in, as it is now, but there seems to have been a second entrance by the back way from Warren Lane. The Market and High Street. \u2014 One of the strangest revelations due to this plan is the discovery that the old Market HouseJ stood at (i) * Cholick : ch pronounced hard as h ; sometimes spelt \" Collick.\" t See Hypothetical View, next title-page. X The subject of the markets is more fully treated later in this chapter."], [119, "43 WOOLWICH. the lower end of Ropeyard Rails, where the Cage was, and where St. Saviour's Schools now stand. The open ground now known as the Market Head, in High Street, was then all built over with houses, and a new market house (r) had been erected in a square on the river side of it ; while the wharf beyond, from which the steamboats now start was (y) a woodyard. New Street (q) was New Street then, having too long outlived its name; but the market-place was then below, not above it. On the other side of Bell* Watergate (s) was {x) Rem nant'sf private foundry of shot and shell (where now is Edgar's coal wharf), and this will probably explain the error into which other old histriographers have fallen in stating that the Gunwharf at Woolwich formerly stood on the site ofthe market-place. + Meeting House Lane (m) to-day perpetuates the existence of the early Nonconformists' chapel ; \u00a7 and we have heard traditions of (l) the Old Orchard and (n) Caribbee Isles, which were on the site of Rodney Street and the Baths, but survived in name only, even in 1748. The small building which stands in the centre of High Street is pro bably the parish pump, and we may suppose that the small circles at Warren Lane and other places represent wells. It will be observed that the triangular projection just above R exactly corresponds with the shape of the present paved market-place, and the little alley across it exists to-day in the shape of a narrow road. Water Stairs and Alleys. \u2014 The landing-place which we call Ship Stairs was then \" Sheep Stairs,\" and another landing, known as the \" Blue Anchor Stairs,\" was at the bottom of Globe Lane. Therb was a \" Cock Yard,\" as now, on the opposite side of High Street, and a \" Cow Yard \" on the Market Hill. Cow Yard (\u00ab) h^s*lost all trace of its inelegant title, unless we can follow its development in its present name of Gough Yard. Here we may see in embryo the lanes and * The Bell Tavern at Woolwich is mentioned in a State Paper relating to a theft of cordage belonging to the State (Commonwealth), dated Jan. 18th, 1655. t The following epitaph on \" Stephen Remnant, Esq., of Woolwich,\" I have seen quoted as a literary curiosity\u2014 \" Here's a Remnant of life and a Remnant of death, Taken at once in a Remnant of breath ; To mortality this gives a happy release, For what was the Remnant is now the whole -piece.\" % In Lysons' \" Environs of London,\" published in 1796, it is said that \" the Gun- wharf at Woolwich is a very ancient place and formerly occupied the site of the market- place in High Street.\" There is no authority for this belief other than Lysons, who made the statement \" on the information of John Cockburn, Esq., Storekeeper of the Warren.\" The supposition is contrary to all the teachings of the official records, and probably arose from a confused tradition relating to Mr. Remnant's shot and shell foundry, which stood at this spot. \u00a7 See Records of Nonconformity."], [120, "44 RECOEDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. orchards which ultimately became built about, but still bear the name of \" The Gardens.\" The alleys all converge upon a footpath which led from Cock Yard (A) to the upper part of Green's End and thence to the Common. Hare Street, which now takes a similar direction, had not yet been thought off, and was, in fact, not a thoroughfare for nearly a hundred years after Barker's plan was drawn. Old West Woolwich. \u2014 We commence our inspection of the second half of Barker's plan where it should join the first. The contemptuous nomenclature of the old alleys observed in the east pursues us in the west. There is Hog Lane (u), which we have recently refined into Nile Street ; * there is the sister Sow Alley (v), and a little Pig Court (w). Glass Yard (x), in which at this time the Huguenot glassblowers probably worked, and Short's \u2022 Alley (y), still hold fast to their ancient titles, but some of the other courts have disappeared. The Parsonage. \u2014 At the western end of Short's Alley (y), and under the reference e\\ will be seen a house standing in an extensive garden. This was the old parsonage, which had on one hand High Street and Parson's Hill, and on the other side the Thames, into which at some remoter day its green lawn dipped. Such a dwelling as Swift had in his mind when he said \u2014 I've often wished that I had clear For life six hundred pounds a year, A handsome house to lodge a friend, A river at my garden's end. Our fathers have told us of this rectory as it stood at the foot of Parson's Hill early in the present century, and both in the plan and in Buck's view (Plate IY., pages 4-5) it is distinctly seen. It faced the river, having its back on High Street, and was approached on both sides through an avenue of trees, now a mere alley entering by the gas works, and emerging at the soup-kitchen, but even now spoken of as \" The Grove.\" Prince Rupert. \u2014 Tradition has it that this house was the residence of Prince Rupert when he was constructing the defences of Woolwich and fighting for the Stuarts, and that the various \" yards \" in the vicinity bearing the names of animals were so many appurtenances of his establishment \u2014 \" Dog Yard \" being the kennel, and \" Hog Lane \" the piggery, and so on. There is, however, no evidence to support the assumption, and the probabilities are against it.t * The \" Green Dragon \" tavern at the bottom was re-christened \" The Nile \"in honour of Nelson's victory. It was demolished in 1887 for the Steam Ferry. t See Prince Rupert at the Royal Arsenal."], [121, "45 WOOLWICH. Sir Martin Bowes. \u2014 I find, however, that there was in earlier times a second, and probably more important, mansion at this spot, the exact site of which I should fix at the bottom of Glass Yard. If Rupert resided in this vicinity it is likely that he may have occupied this latter house, where I am of opinion that another distinguished man, of more consequence to Woolwich than even Prince Rupert, had his home. This was Sir Martin Bowes, who is described by old Stow as \" a great and worthy citizen, Lord Mayor of London, and a benefactor of the first size.\" He was of the Company of Goldsmiths, and endowed the Goldsmiths' Almshouses in Cannon Row, one of the most valuable of the Woolwich charities. He flourished in the reigns of Henry VIII. and Edward VI., and died on the 4th of August, 1566.* The remains of a large dilapidated house in Cock Yard were recently exposed during the progress of the Hare Street improvement, and it was hinted that this was believed to have been the house of Sir Martin Bowes ; but I have reason to think that his residence was by the river side and nearer the Dockyard. In 1541, Henry VIII. granted to Sir Martin Bowes a dwelling house, with a garden and wharf belonging to it, in Woolwich. f This property Sir Martin leased or sold for a time, but in after years regained and bequeathed to his family, and this, until there is proof to the contrary, I can only identify with the mansion in \" The Grove.\" The old parsonage was pulled down in 1809, when the present Eectory was built on the Glebe. I have ventured to suppose that this locality north of High Street may have been part of the manor of \" Jefferys.\"\u00a3 The Church Hill. \u2014 The approaches on either side of the church yard (ex and e2) were both known as Church Hill, as indeed they were until lately. Edward Street or Parson's Hill, either of which may now represent e1, was then continued by a footpath going in the direc tion of the Common, still traceable in an alley leading out of Parson's Hill by the forge. The Church. \u2014 The church in Barker's plan was the present structure, then newly built, and the old edifice, which we have seen as it stood in 1739 (plate iv.), had been swept away. The footpath * Mure of Sir Martin Bowes (with portrait) hereafter. Stow describes Sir Martin's tomb in the church of St. Mary Wolnoth as being \"of goodly marble, under the communion table, where his will is also kept.\" Sir Martin Bowes was four times Lord Mayor of London. + Page 16. X The estate of Jefferys consisted of 540 acres. All, or nearly all, the remaining area us the parish was in the estate of Southall (see \"Manor Rolls \"). The premises ol Sir Martin Bowes are described iu the Chancery records as having consisted of a capital messuage, orchard, and wharf, and 2\u00a3 acres, near the Kingstield (probably east of the Dockyard) in Woolwich, late belonging to the Monastery of St. Mary Overy Southwark. n"], [122, "46 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. through the churchyard was not railed off until about 1848. The addition to the south side of the burial-ground was made in 1801. On the western side of the churchyard we see the orchard which suggested our Orchard Street, and we may peradventure recognise some of the surviving houses on the side of Church Hill. The old Dockyard Gates. \u2014 At e2 we come upon another revela tion. There is a footpath and flight of steps descending abruptly to the Dockyard wall, in which, at the protuberance which I have always believed marks the diversion of the ancient highway,* there are evidences of an entrance. This induced me to examine more closely the model of the Dockyard in the Repository, and, having had it Woolwich Dockyard Gates at Church Hill, 1748. is now occupied by the Globe and Sheer Hulk taverns, brought into the light, I found the gates, a sketch of which I made on the spot. Probably no one living was aware that the Dockyard gates were ever in this position. Hill's Alley (d), just facing the old gates, is now Sun Street. The object to the left of the letter probably represents a public well. New Alley (c) is now known as Martyr's Pass age, but the cottages called Doudie's Carribees (b) are van ished and forgotten. The site The Dockyard extended no farther than this point in 1748 ; and on the west we see \" the Sand Quay,\" at which the sand brought from Bowater's pits (r) was shipped. The road from the pits, which is now Chapel Street, ran straight to the river through an orchard. Henry Street and Frances Street had not been formed, and Mr. Bo water's house and garden, as before stated, stood on the sand cliff. The larger ofthe two buildings seen on the plan (q) was the mansion, the smaller the stabling and farmhouse. The Church Footpath. \u2014 We may learn that in Barker's time the only communication between the Dockyard and the Common, other than by toiling through a sandpit or going a long way round, was the footpath across the fields from the church, which footpath followed in its upper part the present line of Rectory Place and Mulgrave Place. * The road which runs through the Dockyard is a direct continuation of the original highway, which seems to have been diverted to the south, being probably pushed out to form Church Street in the early growth of the Dockyard."], [123, "a, Gateway. b, Porter's House. c.

Five Generations Back. \u2014 By tbe aid of this very precise plan View from the West End of Woolwich Dockyard, 1744. Showing the Stairs and Sand Quay. and the accompanying views we may construct a fairly satisfactory idea of Woolwich as it existed a hundred and fifty years since, and realise with more or less accuracy the circumstances under which our fore fathers lived in tbe older days, and during some of the events embraced within the records. I light, for instance, on this singular incident, the actors in which could scarcely have expected that it would be preserved and brought to light five generations after : \u2014 March 24.7?, 1760. \u2014 Whereas the mill built by the shipwrights belonging to His Majesty's Dockyard at Woolwich was on Sunday the 16th of this instant, consumed by fire ; and it having been scandalously and maliciously reported that the bakers belonging to the said Town were concerned in setting the same on fire ; therefore we, Thomas Fleet, John Hodgkinson, Thomas Asslott, George Sargent, George Moore, and Robert Shewring, all of Woolwich in the County of Kent, Bakers, do severally make oath and say that they neither knew nor heard of the same in flames, and that they nor any of them did not set the same on fire, or were in any manner whatever accessory to the said accident. Signed, &c. All six sworn before me, Thomas Chittv Mayor.* This mill, built by tbe shipwrights, is a proof that co-operation is not tbe new thing in Woolwich it is generally supposed to be. Where tbe mill was situated is not specified, but in Proctor's view of 1796 we discern the old mill which stood in Mill Lane even in our own day, * Lord Mayor of London."], [126, "48 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. and none of the views of Woolwich represent any other. We may therefore at least surmise that this old mill, of which I bave a very artistic engraving drawn by Mr. W. Clifton (plate xvi.), was tbe mill built by tbe shipwrights. The Market House. \u2014 But, as already observed, one of tbe most remarkable discoveries which are due to Barker's plan is the Market House, which stood at the end of Ropeyard Rails, where we now find St. Saviour's schools. This spot, which was for centuries in tbe best part of the High Street, and the heart of tbe little town, was in our time (i.e. 1849) occupied by tbe parish cage. Tbe cage, which was removed shortly afterwards, bore tbe date of 1812. A similar structure preceded it, and we may safely infer, now that we know the Market House was there, that the cage and stocks were there also.* Who would have thought that just a hundred years before we saw the cage pulled down an old market toll-house was at the point of death on the selfsame spot ? So far as we are able to judge from tbe plan (i) the structure was of the kind still to be found existing in antiquated towns, its principal use being probably that of an office for collecting the market tolls from the dealers who occupied tbe surrounding space. A New Market. \u2014 The market itself appears, however, to have, in Barker's time, recently removed to the newer market place, just described as on the site of Ross's wharf. This, tbe second market place, was not open to High Street, as tbe market-place known to us has been for the last two or three generations. It was a quad rangle enclosed by buildings with narrow entrances from High Street and New Street. There was a squi re market bouse in tbe centre of this, the second market, and the buildings round were probably butchers' shambles and shops, for I am told that there were some underground ruins hereabout, in which the boys were wont to play sixty years ago. The accompanying sketch, made near this spot about 1835, would have shown a portion of these remains if they had then existed, but they had disappeared. The tent-like erection in the centre of the picture was, I believe, a shelter over the parish pump, which stood here in 1835, and is shown also in Barker's plan of eighty-six years earlier. Another new Market. \u2014 The date of another market-place is fixed by a note in the supplement to Lysons' Environs (1811), which says \u2014 Under an Act of Parliament passed in 1807, Woolwich has now two market days, * In 1664 there was a report made to the Admiralty by the Master Shipwright, Chris. Pett, of the arrest of the servant to the carpenter of the yacht Henrietta for stealing old iron. He says : \"We put him in the stocks, when he confessed that he sold it to a smith in the town. He was then taken from the stocks aud whipped and discharged from the Dockyard.\" The stocks and not the cage are here mentioned, but in 1798 the cage was reported to be on the site of the market house (see page 57)."], [127, "PLATE IX. Woolwich Cage, 1835. Market Hill, Woolwich, 1835. [To face page 48.]"], [128, ""], [129, "49 WOOLWICH. Wednesday and Saturday. The old market was on Friday. The market-place is about to be removed under the above mentioned Act, and a new site has been prepared.* It was stated in this Act that tbe old market-place (tbe \" new market place \" of Barker's plan) bad fallen into disuse for want of proper accommodation, and that it would be of great utility to have a suitable market-bouse erected (wbicb it never was). Tbe condemned place was described as \"tbe market, shambles, buildings, and erections thereto attached,\" all until that time private property. The buildings attached to tbe market included tbe Crown and Cushion public -bouse (John Kibble), tbe Waterman's Arms (John Bull), the wharf bouse and market (John Strother), the Ring's Head public -house (Jobn Prebble), four shops and fourteen private bouses, tbe whole belonging to Lady Wilson. On its site now stand Ross's Wharf House and tbe shops on tbe north side of Market Head. The Act of 1807 was, however, a futile measure. It was deemed inexplicit, and an Act of the following session (48 Geo. III.) was passed to set it right. The petition wbicb forms tbe preamble of this Act will explain tbe difficulty : \u2014 Whereas an Act was passed in the Forty-seventh year of His present Majesty, intituled, \"An act for paving, cleaning, lighting, and watching the Town and Parish of Woolwich, in the County of Kent, and removing and preventing nuisances therein ; for the better relief and employment of the poor ; for providing an additional Burial Ground ; and for regulating the Market of the said Town and Parish,\" and whereas doubts have arisen whether, under the Provisions of the said Act, the Commissioners thereby appointed can purchase ground and erect a Market House and Shambles thereon, without previously purchasing the present Market, Shambles, and Erections attached thereto ; May it therefore please your Majesty, and be it enacted in this present Parliament, that it may be lawful for the said Commissioners to contract and agree with any Person or Persons whomsoever for the Purchase of a Piece of Ground within the said Town, not exceeding one acre and a half, or to take and accept a Lease thereof for any Term not being less than eighty years, at a full or nominal Ground Rent for the same, and to erect a Market House, Shambles, and other necessary buildings thereon, as the said Commissioners shall think proper, without previously purchasing the present Market House, Shambles, and Erections attached thereto. Under this Act it appears tbe Town Commissioners purchased the ground upon which the Town Hall and police offices stand, and endeavoured to establish a market. But they had reckoned without their public, and, although they put up their shambles, and made all tbe other necessary preparations, they could not get tbe people to go so far \" out of the town \" to do their marketing. They still clung to the Market Head in High Street, and after a while the attempted transporta tion of tbe mart was abandoned as hopeless, all that reminds us of it * The site upon which the Town Hall, &c, now stands."], [130, "50 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. now being the \" Market Streets \" which surround the scene of the failure. Market Hill. \u2014 Some alteration and improvement of the Market Head were, however, effected by tbe Wilson family, to whom tbe site and the market rights belonged ; and the present space, having been ultimately cleared of tbe old buildings upon it, was used instead of the spot nearer tbe river. Migration of the Market. \u2014 And so it continued and flourished until that era of changes, tbe time of tbe Crimean War, 1854-5, when the population shifted eastward, and the dealers followed, leading an unsettled life about the streets, at constant war with tbe authorities, until they were allowed to congregate in Beresford Square. The Market Charter. \u2014 -Woolwich Market, through all its vicissi tudes, has lasted for two hundred and seventy years. It exists by virtue of an ancient charter wbicb reads like a vestige of feudal law. It was King James I. who issued letters patent, bearing date the First day of June, in the Sixteenth year of His Reign (1619), granting \"by the request and for the benefit of the inhabitants \" \u2014 To Sir JFilliam Barne* Knight, and Hucjh Lyddiard, t Esquire, and their Heirs and Assigns for ever, the right to hold and keep, within the town of Woolwich, and the Liberties and Precincts of the same, one Market Day on Friday in every Week, yearly to be holden and Kept ; and also two Fairs or Marts yearly, one on the First Day of June, and the other on the Feast Day of Saint Simon and Saint Jude, together with the incident separate Pie-powder Courts, for the Time of the said Fairs or Marts respectively to be held, and with all Liberties and free Customs, Tollage, Stallage, Piccage, Fines, Amerciaments, and all other profits for their own use and benefit. Tolls for Two Hundred and Fifty Years. \u2014 And thenceforward, for their own use and benefit, Barnes and Lyddiard, their heirs and successors, took the market tolls for two hundred and fifty years. Lady Wilson and Sir Thomas Wilson, to whom the privilege descended with the freehold of tbe adjacent property, always bad their agents out * Sir William Barne (or Barnes) was knighted in 1603. Lysons says : \"A family of good account, called Barnes, sometimes Barne, settled in Woolwich in Elizabeth's reign. In 1596 Sir WilUam Barnes was a justice of the peace \u2014 a time, Mr. Lambarde says, when only persons of the highest reputation and the best gentry being in the Commission, it was an honour to everyone who was named on it.\" The son of the Sir William here mentioned was Lord Mayor of London, and among his descend- ants was Sir William Lovelace, father of the cavalier poet, Richard Lovelace, who was born at Woolwich. The name of \" Barnes\" turns up repeatedly in our old records, and we have already seen it in an incident of the Civil Wars (page 34). t Hugh Lyddiard was clerk of the cheque at Woolwich Dockyard and a favoured individual. A grant made by the King on June 22nd, 1604, conferred upon this Hugh Lyddiard the offices of Clerk of the Cheque of the Navy and Works at Wool- wich, and Clerk of the Storehouse for life. The 'privilege of the market tolls was another piece of favouritism."], [131, "WOOLWICH. 51 on market days, collecting the dues, so long as tbe market remained in situ ; but when it became scattered, as beforesaid, the attempt to levy tbe tax was abandoned. Tbe Act of 1808, however, expressly pre served and perpetuated the manorial rights, and subject to this proviso it was enacted \u2014 That such market shall be holden on the Wednesday and Saturday in each and every week,* Christmas Days and Fast Days by proclamation excepted. But, whatever tbe local authorities did, tbe lord of tbe manor was still paramount. When the Commissioners established (or attempted to establish) the market on tbe site of tbe Town Hall and police court, the agents of Sir Thomas Wilson were allowed to walk in and collect the tolls, just as they always did when the market was in High Street. However, as just observed, tbe profits of tbe market tolls diminished as tbe dealers migrated eastward, and they bad become a minus quantity when, in 1868, tbe Local Board leased them for twenty-one years of Sir Thomas Maryon Wilson for a nominal sum, and attempted to lure back the trade to High Street. The old spot was paved and lighted and otherwise improved, but the market bad gone for ever. The town bad changed its centre owing to the extension of the Arsenal and tbe growth of Plumstead, and tbe dealers followed tbe people. Beresford Square. \u2014 In defiance of all efforts to check it, a vigorous market soon grew up in Beresford Square. For many years tbe local authorities feigned to ignore it, or tried to crush it, but it continued to flourish in a free and lawless manner, whilst tbe ancient market-place became utterly deserted. About 1884 tbe Local Board began with hesitation to recognise and acknowledge tbe inevitable by putting \"tbe Square\" under some sanitary supervision, and in 1887 Sir Spencer Maryon Wilson sold all bis rigbtsf in tbe matter to the parish for tbe sum of \u00a3500. In 1888 tbe Local Board made regulations for this Beresford Square Market, and, in order to extend it, cleared away a plantation of trees and shrubs wbicb bad been formed on the western side some twenty years before. The One Long Street. \u2014 Returning now to Barker's plan, we may observe that it is confirmed by another plan of tbe Dockyard drawn by a later band, in 1753, and preserved in tbe same volume of tbe King's Library. From these two maps together we learn that tbe north-western side of Church Hill was all a hillock of open ground crossed by footpaths. There was then no entrance to tbe churchyard * An Act was passed in 1847 by which such markets are permitted to be held on such other days as the local authorities may appoint. t The market rights extend to the whole of the parish."], [132, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 52 on the side next Parson's Hill ; tbe churchyard did not extend so far; and there was no Parson's Hill, no St. Mary Street, Orchard Street, Coleman Street, Warwick Street, Chapel Street, Queen Street, Henry Street, nor Frances Street. Tbe few narrow openings, like Sun Alley, Martyr's Passage, and Bowling Green Row, led from Church Street, to fields, gardens, and solitary cottages, and virtually the whole of Woolwich, save the one long street, was in the hands of tbe hus- bandman. Views Of Old Woolwich.\u2014 The picture of Old Woolwich which appears as a frontispiece was drawn by T. Girtin and published in 1798. Another similar view, of which I now present a copy, is of unknown date, but it is probably earlier than Girtin's work. The two, however, fairly correspond, and both appear to be taken from precisely the same spot. This posi tion I have endeavoured to trace, but I bave long been uncertain. Neither Rectory Place nor Frances Street would fit the situation, but I bave learnt that a farm lane, now extinct, passed from the church to and beyond Bo water House, over wbicb lane tbe public bad a semi right of way which was continued for some time after tbe Marine Map of Dockyard District, 1832. Barracks were rebuilt. The present back-way to these (the Cambridge) barracks from King Street went completely through the barracks fifty years ago, and there is a remnant of this road which we can still trace in tbe greensward up to the rear of the Red Barracks and the site of tbe old Manor House. The road is shown by tbe $$\" in the plan here given, which is copied from a map of the Borough drawn at its formation in 1832, and I have no doubt that it was from the highest point of this road, just at the back of the Red Barracks, that our artists sketched Old Woolwich. The Pleasant Little Town. \u2014 Here then we are brought face to face with tbe rural Woolwich of a hundred years ago, and stand in a country lane between hedges and in the midst of fields, where now bricks and mortar cover the ground in all directions. Within a tract of perhaps a mile in each direction, we see only one or two home steads, a row of cottages behind tbe Church, and the roofs of a few"], [133, "Old Woolwich. \u2014 A Sketch of the Last Century. [To face page 52.] PLATE X"], [134, ""], [135, "53 WOOLWICH. houses at Church Hill. The rest of tbe town is bidden by the rising ground. The house on tbe hill to the right stood near tbe site of the Congre gational Church in Rectory Place. The one below may bave been the predecessor of \" Grove House \" in Rectory Grove. The letterpress description which appears under the original of Girtin's picture (our frontispiece) in the Kent Itinerant is worth quoting : \u2014 Woolwich. \u2014 This pleasant little town is most delightfully situated on the southern bank of the Thames. It is remarkable that part of the parish is on the opposite side of the Thames, on the Essex shore, and where formerly there was a chapel, though included in the county of Kent. The town is not only rendered considerable by its excellent Dockyard, the oldest belonging to the Royal Navy, and which is reported to have furnished as many men-of-war as any two in the kingdom, but it is also deservedly famous as our British university for the military science, where young gentlemen are regularly instructed in all the arts of gunnery and fortification. It is indeed the usual residence of the Koyal Regiment of Artillery, who have an academy for instructing the train in the art of gunnery, and a company of matrosses are commonly employed in making up cartridges, and charging bombs, carcases, and grenadoes. In the Warren or Park, where trial is made of great guns and mortars, there are some thousand pieces of ordnance, with a prodigious number of shot and shells. The town has a market every Friday, but no fair, and there is an almshouse for poor widows. The famous Mr. Duncan Campbell* has also assisted the celebrity, if not the reputation, of this place, by stationing his academy of convicted felons in lighters off the town of Woolwich, for the purpose of heaving ballast from the bed of the river. Woolwich a \"Watering-place.\" \u2014 The resident of Woolwich to-day will be gratified to note in the foregoing description the character Woolwich from Sandy Hill, 1836 of the \"pleasant little town \" as it existed in the past century. But even more recently it has received similar compliments from equally disinterested observers. It is classed as one of the \" Watering-places Mr. Campbell had charge of the convict hulks."], [136, "54 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. of Great Britain \" * in a work of that name, published in 1836, and the view from Sandy Hill is bere reproduced from an engraving which appears therein. Furthermore, we have evidence to the same effect in \"Cock's Guide\" of 1837, which says\u2014 The short distance from the Metropolis, the facilities afforded by steamboat conveyance, &c, together with the salubriousness and gentility of the higher parts of the town, form a powerful incitement for some of the London merchants to make Woolwich their place of abode. A Youthful Elopement.* \u2014 But we have not yet done with the eighteenth century, respecting which we glean some interesting extracts from the Showell Collection,')' a series of scrap-books filled with pictures and newspaper cuttings, to which we are indebted for many records. Amongst them we find the following, which was printed about the year 1770 \u2014 Taken away by violence from her friends at Woolwich, by breaking open the locks of her chamber and parlour doors, and forcing her out of a window, Mary Baker : she is not 15 years old, has a speck in each eye, dressed in an old linen bedgown, with no stays on, a light-coloured quilted petticoat, and a red cloak, under the pretence of an arrest for a debt, by John Davis . . . And supposed to be concealed by John Spencer, about 13 years old, son-in-law of the said John Davis. This is to caution all persons not to secrete or harbour the said Mary Baker, all clergymen are desired not to marry them, and all inn-keepers and stable-keepers are not to furnish such persons with post-chaises or carriages. AVhoever will bring the young Lady unmarried to Cuthbert Andrews at his Majesty's Rope Yard at Woolwich will receive 20 guineas reward. Under 1769 we read \u2014 Yesterday morning was married at Woolwich George Bond, Esquire, to Miss Norris of Woolwich, an agreeable young Lady with a genteel Fortune. These scrap-books will have to be frequently referred to Pies and Puddings. \u2014 The rolls of the Royal Military Academy will also have to be quoted freely, and will be found amusing. The following is one extract : \u2014 Jan. 1795. \u2014 The inhabitants of Woolwich having signed an agreement to leave off pastry during tlie high price of flour, the Governor of the Academy dispenses with the usual pies and puddings, but recommends the housekeeper to provide rice puddings at the Cadets' table every Tuesday. Our Lord Mayor. \u2014 The Lord Mayor of London formerly reigned over Woolwich : * \" The Watering Places of Great Britain and Fashionable Directory, illustrated with views of all the places of resort in the United Kingdom.

London : Frv, White Conduit Grove, Pentonville, 1836.\" + The collection appears to have been made by Colonel David Showell, of Park Lodge, Hatcham. The drawings were principally by 0. Lennell, prior to 1841, and the whole of the collection was presented by Mrs. Showell to the British Museum."], [137, "55 WOOLWICH. Jaly, 28th, 1770. On Friday last the Lord Mayor held a Court of Conservancy at the Ship Tavern, Woolwich, and also went on board the Russian man-of-war. A great many Aldermen were present, and this being Mr. Wilkes's first appearance at Woolwich since an Alderman, a number of people assembled to see him. The Old Volunteers. \u2014 If it be only t. .troduce two other persons connected with our history, I may refer e fact that our locality was loyal according to its ability in the volunteer movement ofthe last century. At an entertainment given by Lord Romney to the county volunteers at his lordship's seat near Maidstone, in tbe presence of King George III. and tbe Royal Family, on the 1st of August, 1799, there were mustered 5,319 officers and men, among whom are mentioned \u2014 From Woolwich, Captain Remnant* and 21 cavalry, Captain Powis and 66 cavalry. From Greenwich, Captain Cooke and 32 cavalry, Captain Campbell and 129 cavalry. From Deptford, Captain Goodhew and 41 cavalry, Captain Lamb and 53 cavalry. Tbe Loyal Greenwich Water Fencibles, under Captain Colegate, with a roll of 192, did not attend the Review. Woolwich contributed some years later a troop to the \" Blackheath Volunteer Cavalry,\" referred to in the Records of the Garrison. * The name of Remnant we have already seen. This officer was doubtless a member of the family which formerly had the shot foundry at Bell Watergate. Captain Powis, the founder of the Powis Estate, had been a brewer at Greenwich."], [138, "Paul Sandby, 1785. By R. Conway, R.A. Reproduced from the Original Steel Plate. CHAPTER V. MATURITY. Improved and Beautified. \u2014 Being an ancient town, grown up before building acts, street regulations, and sanitary science were thought of, Woolwich is an inheritance which has vexed the souls of several generations of its modern inhabitants, and has left much to be done for its narrow and crooked ways, its bouses and its people, before it can hope to vie in health and comfort and respectability with its younger neighbours. Nevertheless, it is certain that the town has been consider ably reformed, and, at least for eighty years, the principal work of its local government has been the effort to repair the errors of tbe past. We read, indeed, in a gazette of the eighteenth century, that as early as 1750 the town had \" recently been much improved and beautified,\" which probably refers to the market buildings at that time newly erected in High Street. Until then tbe town bad apparently vegetated from its very beginning, without any idea of advancement beyond the market"], [139, "The Original Drawing from which I have t.aken this interesting picture of Green's End is in manuscript, and bears neither date nor name of the artist. It is, however, probably the work of Paul Sandby, and the collection of whicli it forms part is supposed to have been made in 1786. The point of observation is marked at the present day by the corner of Lower Market Street, and the house in the centre of the middle-distance is the former Duchess of Wellington Tavern, now the Green's End Distillery, which m.ay then have been a private residence or school. The building seen above the roof to the right might stand for the Chapel erected by the Wesleyans, afterwards the Roman Catholic Church, and now the Steam Flour-Mills, but cannot be reconciled with the date assigned, as the Chapel was not built until 1789. The probability is that the sketch is of about the year 1790. The road on the right hand is Love Lane, and beyond is the Sappers' Green, which gave the name to \"Green's End.\" [To face page 56-] PLATE XI."], [140, ""], [141, "57 WOOLWICH. house, the cage and the stocks. Here was the seat of government, here was the rendezvous of the old watchmen and constables ; * and here the ale-tasters, beadles, and highway surveyors held court and sway. And, notwithstanding the erection in 1748 of the new \" market and shambles \" farther west, the old Market House did not desert its ground until 1774, when, being utterly condemned as a nuisance, it was pulled down. The Centre of Government. \u2014 The parishioners did not rebuild their market house, though it seems to have stood upon a parish free hold, for we are told in tbe charity records that \u2014 In 1687 Sir Richard Pritchard gave the old market-place, where the cage now is, for the henefit of the poor. \u2014 Table of Benefactions, 1798. It should be noted, however, that Sir Richard Pritchard gave the site for the almshouses, and there may be some confusion bere. There is no doubt that the market house was timber-built, and dilapidated before it had seen very many years. There is the following entry in the Vestry books of \u2014 March, 1735. \u2014 Resolved to pull down the cage, watch-house, and stocks, and rehuild as before on the same ground. This intention was not performed. Tbe building, as just stated, was not demolished until 1774, and then a watch-bouse, cage, and stocks were undoubtedly built upon the site. This edifice would scarcely be dignified with tbe character which attaches to the centre of govern ment, and we may therefore assume that from 1737 until 1840, when the Town Hall was built \u2014 that is, for more than a hundred years \u2014 Woolwich had no recognised seat of authority ; justice aud other local requirements being administered at some schoolroom or public tavern. Even the watch-house built in 1774 did not endure until our time. It had to be rebuilt in 1812. The Stocks. \u2014 The stocks, too, had altogether disappeared in 1849, but many of the inhabitants remember them. The last reference I find to their employment as a punishment is dated October 30, 1835 : \u2014 A man named Castleton appeared in a state of intoxication to give evidence before the magistrates, who, instantly perceiving, refused to hear his evidence and fined him five shillings for being drunk. He refused to pay, and Dr. Watson sentenced him to six hours in the stocks. * The frequent mention of these constables in the parochial and manorial papers tempts a quotation from Bishop Earl : '\"A constable is a viceroy in the street, anil no man stands more upon't that he is the king's officer. His jurisdiction extends to the next stocks, where he has commission ior the heels only, and sets the rest of the body at liberty. He is a scarecrow to that alehouse where he drinks not his morn- ing draught, and apprehends a drunkard for not standing in the king's name. Beggars fear him more than the justice, and as much as the whipstock, whom he delivers over to his subordinate magistrates, the bridewell man and the beadle.\""], [142, "58 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT.

On she went To find the knight in limbo pent ; And 'twas not long before she found Him and the stout squire in the pound, Both coupled in enchanted tether, By further leg behind together. Five Markets. \u2014 Taking the site of the cage as the first market place, we have regarded as the \" second market \" that which we see in Barker's plan, encroaching upon our \" Roff's wharf.\" In 1807, when an attempt was made to establish a third market on tbe Town Hall site, tbe second market was described as ruinous, and \" all fallen into disuse for want of proper accommodation,\" and such it remained for a good many years, as it is shown in the same position both in a map of the Ordnance property drawn in 1810, and in a private plan of tbeBow ater Estate prepared in lb20. At the latter date, as I am told by aged"], [143, "59 WOOLWICH. people, only the basement of tbe shambles remained, and these were cleared away to the foundations when the fourth market was laid out close by on Market Hill. Beresford Square is consequently the fifth Woolwich market. The old Draughtsmen. \u2014 We have seen how much of the information and interest afforded by these records is ascribable to the old prints which illustrate the text. These, it will be noticed, are chiefly attributable to the latter half of the eighteenth century, when the art of engraving underwent a great advancement, and public taste and desire for landscape drawings experienced a high development. It is fortunate for us that tbe period corresponds with the lifetime of a generation wbicb must always have an important place in our local his tory, and that the occasion produced such able draughtsmen as Buck, Barker, Milton, Girtin, Sandby and others, who bave left us the heritage of their admirable workmanship for our edification and enjoyment. Paul Sandby. \u2014 Paul Sandby, of whom we have an excellent portrait at the head of this chapter, resided at Woolwich during the greater part of his life, and was a most able, industrious, and popular artist, who found ample employment for his talent, not only in fancy etchings and fugitive sketches, but also in taking views of country seats and illustrating magazines. He is said to bave amassed a large fortune, and tbe hundreds of old prints upon which we find bis name confirm the belief. He was chief drawing master at the Royal Military Academy from August, 1768, to January, 1797. Agricultural Woolwich. \u2014 The rural and picturesque aspect of the town, as presented to us by our artists, endured for some time after the close of the last century. Lysons in tbe first edition of his \" Environs of London \" (1792-5) wrote \u2014 There are in Woolwich, on the Kentish sideof the river, fifty acres of marsh, about forty acres arable, and ten occupied by a market gardener. Some of this agricultural space is now within tbe Dockyard ; the remainder is built upon. Mr. Samuel Hardin farmed nearly tbe whole of it, and at his death in 1803 was succeeded by bis son-in-law, Mr. John Sbersby. Mr. Hardin's farmhouse and residence stood on tbe ground now occupied by tbe large building at the Dockyard gates, formerly tbe quarters of tbe Commodore Superintendent, since in tbe occupation of the Commissariat and Transport staff, and now converted into offices. I have seen in the British Museum an unfinished sketch made on this spot showing \" The Ruins of Mr. Hardin's Farm, Woolwich, inhabited by an old couple, who claim tbe right to it. \u2014 Nov. 12, 1807.\" Shersby's Field. \u2014 The whole of the triangle enclosed by Albion"], [144, "60 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT.

(Showing laud afterwards taken into Dockyard.) began to appear upon it, and in a few years it became completely covered. One of the extensive chalk and lime-pits for which Woolwich was known during the last century occupied part of this area, and"], [145, "61 WOOLWICH. close by the present cliff-like extremity of Morris Street, which is the verge of a chalk -pit, stood in 1842 an old lime-kiln. (See illustration, page 1.) Before the Dockyard Extension. \u2014 The rough plan of which I give a copy appears to have been drawn in the early part of the century, presumably about 1815. It is hastily sketched on a scrap of paper, and was probably penned in court during the progress of a law suit to illustrate tbe locus in quo. The late Mr. S. C. Harrington, of the Bowater Estate, allowed me to make this copy, and it will be useful in showing the remarkable changes which the district it represents has undergone. The references I have inserted, and they may be thus dealt with : \u2014 A. The present entrance to the Dockyard. B. The corner of Chapel Street (at first called \" Chapel Row \"). C. Mary Cottages and Charlotte Place, taken for the Dockyard prior to 1820. D. Prospect Row. The \" Hedge Row \" through Hanging Wood. E. Corner of Sand Street. A large space on this side of the road was taken into the Dockyard in 1842, including \"Adams's Cottages,\" here shown on \"Mr. Bowater's Freehold.\" This will account for the road being now straight.

The Manor Dissolved. \u2014 The Bowater Estate, which once embraced nearly tbe whole of Woolwich, so continued until the beginning of the present century, prior to which there had been no material alienations beyond the surrender of the glebe land, and other space required for the pious uses of the parish church. But the inroads of the Dockyard having once broken through, other ravages followed. The Powis Estate was sold to Mr. Ogilby for \u00a35,000, and another slice to Mr. Shersby for \u00a3500. Both were promptly laid out for building, and tbe Board of Commissioners were wise in securing the plot which, after failing with their projected market, tbeyr turned to account as sites for the present Police Offices and Town Hall. Wellington Street and Green's End. \u2014 Wellington Street and the streets to the westward of it were the growth of the second quarter of the century. The ground which they occupy was all open country in 1812, and Wellington Street itself had but two or three scattered houses built upon it until after 1830, the Sappers' Green remaining much aa it is shown in our view (plate xi.). In that, however, we see only the thoroughfare known as Love Lane. Wellington Street must be drawn in imagination nearer to tbe left-hand corner, which is E"], [146, "62 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. now the corner of Lower Market Street. If we can picture a few houses straggling up the western side of the road we have the Wel lington Street of 1837, when \" Cock's Guide \" * tells us that\u2014 A piece of waste ground in Wellington Street, in the rear of the barracks and belonging to the Bowater Estate, is used as a parade ground, and known by the name of the \" Sappers' Parade.\" East Woolwich in 1810. \u2014 The Ordnance plan of 1810 is here presented, and will clearly show the condition of the eastern portion of Woolwich in that year. Artillery Place, then emerging from the embryo footpath at the back of the barracks, had but a few houses here and there, but Mulgrave Place had begun a sturdy existence. It seems indeed that when the inhabitants ventured away from the waterside they made their first pitch at Mulgrave Place. The houses erected were of rather a superior character, as may be traced even in their present degeneration, and they were occupied by officials con nected with the garrison. It will be seen that in this map Wellington Street exists only as a track over the Green, blocked by a house at the \" Green's End,\" while of the streets which now branch from it there is no trace.

The same year Sanger's circus, which usually occupied the ground behind the Barrack Tavern, wintered on the spot now covered by the Union Street Board Schools. In earlier years, prior to 1848, when space was plentiful, the travelling companies had more choice, and dropped down in the vicinity of Brewer Street, or elsewhere, as they might list. Only once in my remembrance has a show or circus stood on Woolwich Common, and that was in 1885, when Sanger's g^eat tent was seen near the Camp. Sermons in Stones. \u2014 Referring to Beresford Square, we are reminded that the stones which form the paved crossing from the Elephant and Castle to the Mortar Tavern have historic associations with Whitehall and Charing Cross, for in 1884 they were taken up from the space in front of Trafalgar Square, where they had for fifty years or more been trodden by all sorts and conditions of mtn. Though partly worn, they were still suitable for the lighter traffic of Woolwich, and at this and other parts of the town they were advan tageously put to their second use. The First Commissioners. \u2014 The Improvement Act of 1807, recently mentioned, was a well-intended measure. It originated in a strenuous desire to do something for the town and its inhabitants, but the effort appears to have proved too much for its authors, and to have fallen exhausted from lack of stamina. By this enactment Parliament gave sanction for enlarging or rebuilding the old workhouse in Rope Yard Rails, providing a cemetery, re-erecting the market house, and so on, and appointed the following commissioners to carry out these necessary and important works : \u2014 The Rector and churchwardens, Lieut.-Gen. Vaughan Lloyd, Edward Syson, John Tyson, Benjamin Wilmot, Dr. John Rollo, Robinson Kittoe, John Guest, Thomas Fitzmaurice, William Sture, Joseph Meads Madkins, Col. Wm. Borthwick, Capt. Geo. Hayter, John Rutter, Thomas Burnett, Joseph Whidby, Dr. Wm. Witman, Adjutant Ernest, Christian Wilford, Wm. Absalom, John Bonnycastle, Richard Dunmall, jun., Wm. Austin, John Henderson, Rev. John Bligh, James Stone, Capt. Henry Deacon, Capt. Tremenare, John Long, Thomas Percival, Thomas Foster, and Thomas Mills. The Water Supply. \u2014 The Commissioners were to meet in a room at the poor house and in the Sunday-school room which stood in the churchyard, and they did meet accordingly, but they did not rebuild the workhouse nor the market house, and they did not create a new cemetery. They purchased, however, some additional land to enlarge the churchyard, and set about providing a water supply, having been rightly persuaded that the first condition of health was pure water. The Thames, though clean, was so impregnated with salt as to be unfit for domestic use, and very little to be preferred was the system of"], [153, "PLATE XII. , [To face page 66.] Beresford Square, IFoolwich, 1837 Roman Catholic Church, New Road.

By the second local act (1808) the Commissioners were empowered \u2014 To raise and convey water from a Field in the Parish of Charlton belonging to Dame Jane Wilson and Sir Thomas Maryon Wilson, Baronet, along the high road leading from Greenwich to Woolwich into thc Town of Woolwich, and along the High Road by Unity Place into Frances Street, and from thence into a Reservoir to be made in a field belonging to John Bowater, Esquire, in the occupation of Mary Rideout, Widow,* and afterwards through Lands belonging to the Rector of the said Parish of Woolwich into another Reservoir near AVoolwich Church, in a field in the Occupation of Mr. Samuel Hardin. The source from whence the water was to be obtained was a spring t beside the Woolwich Lower Road by the turnpike at Charlton Lane, where the Kent Water Company fifty years afterwards erected one of their pumps. The Commissioners went to the expense of ,\u00a33,600 in buying the spring and providing machinery, but they were unable to complete the work, and were glad to accept from the Kent Water Com pany of Deptford an offer to take the whole responsibility off their hands. The Company bought the machinery for about \u00a31,000, but found it unsuitable and resold it at a sacrifice. They also complied with the terms of the local act by making a reservoir known as the Bowater Pond, on the land of Mrs. Rideout, but tbe proposal to form another reservoir on the Rector's glebe land near the church was very wisely discarded. A rather extensive reservoir was discovered a few years ago under some stabling near Pickford's yard at tbe back of High Street, but there is no mention of this in any of the documents relating to the Water works that have come under my notice. * Widow of Capt.

CHAPTER VI. EHUCATION New Commissioners. \u2014 An energetic move onward was made in 1834, when a new generation arose and re-established the govern ing body of the town on a fresh basis. We find under date of \u2014 May 7th, 1834. \u2014 The first meeting of the Commissioners of the town and parish of Woolwich was held in the schoolroom on the evening of Thursday last, the Rev. H. Fraser, Rector, in the chair, when the following appointments were made : William Nokes, Esq. solicitor and treasurer ; Mr. Edward Sargent, clerk ; Messrs. Charles Sargent and Samuel Watts, collectors of the parochial rates. We thus come within touch of the present generation, for these officials were all serving within tbe last forty years. Mr. Edward Sargent, besides being clerk to the commissioners, was in 1835 elected actuary to the Woolwich and Plumstead Savings' Bank, \"vice the convict Gloag,\" and became tbe first clerk ofthe Local Board of Health when it was constituted in 1852, Mr. Nokes aforesaid being also retained as its solicitor."], [157, "WOOLWICH. 69 Men of 1837. \u2014 The following were the parochial appointments in Woolwich on the 1st April, 1837 \u2014 \u25a0 Churchwardens : Mr. Barnes and Mr. Parsons.

Modern Advance. \u2014 The tide of progress had started, and in \u2014 April, 1840. \u2014 At a meeting of the Board of Commissioners, Mr. Robert Jolly* intimated his intention of providing a plan for watering the streets of Woolwich. But the old inhabitants were slow to recognise their backward state, and were a long time being convinced. The First Town Hall. \u2014 We have seen that the plot of ground in William Street had been purchased with part of the price obtained by the sale of the parish rights over the Common, and that when the market failure was recognised, tbe Commissioners decided to utilise the ground for a town hall and offices. This met, of course, with opposition, and \u2014 At a Vestry held on March 23rd, 1840, to resist the building of the Town Hall and Board-room in \" the New Market \" it was stated that the clerk of the Board of Commissioners received \u00a340 (!) a year, and \" had only to look after the roads,\" and that the solicitor had \u00a370 a year for getting the parish into law. After many stormy discussions at tbe Board, tbe building was approved, and a tender of \u00a3646 10s. accepted for the work, as designed by Mr. Kinton. The structure was finished in the September following, but it was immediately coveted by the newly-organised police, and on the 10th October, 1840, the Board of Commissioners agreed to sell the new hall to the Government for the sum of \u00a31,322, which included a charge of \u00a34 per foot for tbe freehold site. The cottage behind, at that time occupied by Mr. Postle, the Foreman of Roads, was also sold under * Father of Mr. J. E. Jolly, J.P., &c."], [158, "70 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. the same agreement for an additional \u00a3200, and is now the residence of the court usher. The Second Town Hall. \u2014 Then the Board of Commissioners at once set about building another hall and offices, and in March, 1841, tenders were opened for the work, when the lowest offer, amounting to \u00a3887, was found to have been sent in by Messrs. W. and J. Cann, and it was accepted. The present hall and offices beneath were thereupon erected, and have answered their purpose moderately well.* The whole transaction was unquestionably beneficial to the town. The ratepayers netted \u00a33,000 for the Common without losing any real privileges ; they made a good bargain in selling the first hall to the police, and secured for Woolwich one of the best courts of justice to be found in the Metropolitan area ; having eventually, close to the same spot, their own public hall and offices in a central and convenient yet quiet locality. The original hall was divided for police court purposes by a bisecting wall, forming court and ante-room. Mr. Robert Jolly. \u2014The inhabitants seem for once to have been satisfied, and we see by a newspaper slip that some of them met together in 1841 to present an elegant silver cup to Mr. Robert Jolly, in testimony of their high appreciation of his character, and especially of his attention to the interests of the parishioners in superintending the erection of the Town Hall. Sectarianism. \u2014 Disputes, however, arose quite early as to the letting of the new Town Hall for sectarian purposes. In January, 1844, we read that the British Reformation Society wanted the use of the hall for a public meeting. It was objected that the Roman Catholics might want it for an opposition meeting, and it was proposed that the application be granted for \u00a310. The charge was fixed at \u00a34 10s. as a sufficient deterrent. Sir Robert Peel's Police. \u2014 The police were introduced into Woolwich in January, 1840, but the police court was not opened until the following October, when Mr. Jeremy sat for the first time in the new building. A court had previously been held at the Castle Inn, Powis Street, by the county justices, who presided in the long trian gular apartment now principally used for coroner's inquests. The court was held every Monday and Friday. Small Debts. \u2014 For the recovery of small debts under \u00a35 there was a local authority called \" The Court of Requests,\" f held every alternate Friday at some decent tavern, generally the Crown and Anchor or the * The Clerk's offices have been added within the last twenty years, and the enlargement of the Board-room dates from 1878. t See Page 69."], [159, "71 WOOLWICH. King's Arms. This court was elected by the parishioners on Easter Tuesday, and five members were required to constitute a Bench. But there was still another legal tribunal for the settlement of first offences of a mild description, such as unjust weights and measures, and this was the Board of Commissioners. In 1839, for instance, we find that Mr. Watts, the high constable, was busy haling before this Board a number of tradesmen for their careless or dishonest inattention to the standard, and the Board, having heard what the offenders had to say, ordered them to be taken before the magistrates for punishment. County Court, \u2014 Debtors and creditors whose disputes exceeded the \u00a35 jurisdiction of the Court of Requests had to go to the superior courts in London until the County Court was established at Greenwich, to which money-claims large and small, not exceeding \u00a350, were then referred, and the Court of Requests ceased to exist. The inconvenience of attending at Greenwich, however, was of short duration, for the branch County Court at Woolwich was opened on December 29th, 1848. The parish was subjected to the bankruptcy jurisdiction of Green wich on January 1st, 1870, and included in the London Court of Survey District, October 6th, 1876. The Old Watchmen. \u2014 Sir Robert Peel's policemen were not extended to Woolwich on their first introduction to the Metropolis, and the town was for some time longer under the domination of the old parish constables and watchmen. But on February 23rd, 1839, the papers reported that \u2014 A public meeting is announced to be held by the inhabitants of Woolwich to consider the propriety of petitioning for the introduction of the new police force into that town. When it is considered that there are twenty thousand inhabitants, six or eight night watchmen, and only one police officer by day, some further protection is necessary. In due time the boon was promised and arrangements made, as already stated, for the police to begin duty in January, 1840, when, lo ! on January 4th a tardy vestry resolved almost unanimously to oppose their introduction. Tbe opposition came too late, and we find the advent of the police into the garrison town heralded by the following \u2014 General Order, Jan. 13th, 1840. The Commandant has received intimation that a portion of the Metropolitan Police will commence duty to-day in the parishes of AVoolwich, Plumstead, and Charlton. He thinks it necessary to remind the troops that the object of the Government is for the better security of persons and property, and the general conservation of the public peace. He therefore expects the utmost harmony will exist between the military and police, and that on all occasions when called upon they will aid the police in the execution of their duty."], [160, "72 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. The strength of the force at first was eight men.

A Fall Down a Chimney. \u2014 The following amusing incident found them some employment on the early morning of May 30th, in this year. Mrs. Lacey, of the Red Lion, Mulgrave Place, was awakened by loud groans and woke her husband, who found the house full of smoke and the bar strewed with soot. Tracing the cause to the chimney, he poked up an iron bar and found a man stuck fast, but, having taken out the register, the intruder was dragged down. He proved to he an artilleryman, well known at the house, and living a few doors off. He said that he was in the habit of smoking his pipe on Mr. Lacey's chimney pot, and slipped down ! He was locked up and taken before the court, but his \" little slip \" was forgiven. Business, at first, appears to have been slack.

At a meeting of the Board of Commissioners held only a few months before (November 3rd, 1839), f a letter was read from him appealing (probably with an eye to his pension) for an increase of salary. The increase, from twenty-five to thirty shillings per week, was carried by a majority of three. The Twopenny Post. \u2014 There is no doubt that the town was at this period beginning to assume its later importance. In 1830 it had been made one of the centres or \" rides \" of tbe twopenny post, of which there were but nine in the whole of the suburbs round London. From this centre the letters were conveyed by the postcart to the following stations, which were called \" walks : \" Blackheath, Green wich, Deptford, Rent Road, Peckbam, Lewisham, Eltham, and Bexley Heath. An Elopement. \u2014 Two newspaper extracts of 1832 and 1833 may be inserted here. The first is matrimonial : \u2014 Jan. 21, 1832. \u2014 Yesterday between twelve and one a respectable-looking couple accompanied by a bridesmaid and groom, arrived at St. Mary's, AVhitechapel, with a licence. The marriage ceremony was about to commence wheu two others rushed into the church in breathless haste. They were the father and uncle of the young woman, who had eloped and was going to marry contrary to the wishes of her friends- She is in her twenty-second year and of very prepossessing appearance, is the daughter of a wealthy innkeeper at AVoolwich, and entitled to considerable property. Her adorer is only a constable of the police, and she declared that nothing but absolute force should separate her from her lover ; but her friends removed both of them from the church, and consented that the young man should accompany her home. Making his Bed. \u2014 The second paragraph is funereal, and appeared in 1833:\u2014 Mr. John Cox, stonemason, of Woolwich, many years ago built himself a vault in the churchyard, in which he placed a stone coffin to receive his mortal remains, and, wishing to save executors as much trouble as possible, he erected a tombstone specifying the day of his birth and that he died on the day of 181 , supposing that event would have taken place in the year eighteen hundred and some \" teen \" or other ; but having got through the teens into the twenties, he altered the latter date to 182 ; and, having again beaten old tune, and safely entered into * The first appointments actually date from 1839, having been made in anticipa- tion of the opening of the Police Court. t Nov. 3rd, 1839. \u2014 Board of Commissioners.

The old gentleman is near ninety, and often hobbles on his crutches to the place of his ultimate retirement, to rub out the dates which mischievous urchins chalk upon his tomb. He died in 1835. The Woolwich Advertiser. \u2014 A decent - looking newspaper, called The Woolwich Advertiser and Local Intelligencer, was started on January, 12th, 1839, price fourpence, and, although it comprised but four small pages, was a fair sample of a local paper of that date. In December, 1840, we read therein \u2014 Woolwich is the emporium for all the surrounding towns and villages. The inhabitants of Eltham, Chiselhurst, the Grays, Welling, even of Dartford and Bexley, and the fast-rising new town of Bexley Heath, regularly resort to AVoolwich to replenish tlieir shops. The farmer and man of business haste here weekly to pay into the Bank of England branch, while the humble individual seeks the Savings Bank to place his small deposit. No Public Buildings. \u2014 The erection of the Town Hall appears to have been a work of some necessity, for of public buildings devoted to assemblies and amusements there was a decided scarcity. All the public gatherings which are chronicled were held either in the open air, in schoolrooms, or in taverns.* Theatres. \u2014 Dramatic performances, which have an ancient and uni versal history, were no exception to the foregoing rule. Strolling com panies of players, wandering from town to town, lighted occasionally here, and put up their scanty scenery in barns or public-houses. In 1884 the fragment of a playbill was found behind a skirting board at the Salutation Inn, Woolwich, during alterations, in com pany with a guard report dated January, 1760. It ran thus : \u2014 By the Canterbury Company of Comedians at the Playhouse at the Salutation in AVoolwich, this present evening, being the 10th inst., will be presented a Comedy called \" The Suspicious Husband.\" Ranger, Mr. Smith ; Frankley, Mr. Jackson ; Bellamy, Mr. Claydon ; Mr. Strickland, Mr. Heron ; Jacky Meggott, Mr. C.

The First Elementary Schools.\u2014 A reference which has been made to the British and Foreign Schools requires the explanation that prior to their establishment the only schools for the poor were that founded by Mrs. Withers in Rope Yard Rails and the school adjoining Enon Chapel, both of which are elsewhere dealt with. But about 1820 the town began to realise its educational necessities, and several good private schools were started, with useful results. The National Schools also were founded and opened in the Harmonic Hall (now Co-operative Hall) in Powis Street, and remained there until the present schools in King Street were built, in 1840. The British and Foreign enterprise was worked under the incubus of a troublesome debt, and we find tbe following advertisement : \u2014 Oct. 9th, 1834. \u2014 The committee of the British and Foreign Schools, Powis Street, Woolwich, beg to acquaint the ladies and gentlemen of the Borough of Greenwich that His Majesty's Government have granted the sum of .\u00a3225 towards paying off the debt upon the building, but only on condition that the remaining sum of .\u00a3235 is bonafide raised by the friends of the institution.

There were gas works in Woolwich for nearly twenty years before the prejudice against tbe \" new-fangled light \" was overcome. The first gas factory was a very small concern at the bottom of Surgeon Street, on the site of Edgar's coal wharf, and belonged to one of the Livesay family, the first manager being Mr. Sanderson, who had previously exhibited the light in his shop window, in Richard Street (the upper part of Hare Street). The charge for the gas was thirteen shillings per thousand feet, and the few public lamps that were supplied with the wonderful illuminant were never lighted on moonlight nights nor during the summer. This embryo enterprise, which dated from 1820, was merged in the Equitable Gas Company when that company was started in 1832. The Consumers' (at first styled \" The Protective \") Company originated in 1844, and both were absorbed in the South Metropolitan system in 1885 (1st Jan.). It is worthy of note that one of the Livesay family is at the head of our present gas supply, being chairman of the South Metropolitan Company, just mentioned The experi ments which preceded the introduction of coal gas as a lighting agent were made at Shooters' Hill ; and, seeing this early connection of the district with the now universal gaslight, it is discreditable to note that the streets generally were lighted with oil until 1844.

Woolwich in 1840. \u2014 The growth and progress of the town had then begun, but it was still a town far different from the Woolwich of to-day."], [171, "79 W00LAVICH. In 1840 the private houses in Powis Street greatly outnumbered the shops, even at the busier end, next the Royal Arsenal. The Pres byterian church at the south-east corner stood in a graveyard, and the site is now covered by the Powis Arms and the shops of Messrs. Reed and Purvis in Green's End, and the butcher's shop in Powis Street. Close to the British and Foreign School, on the north side, was the shop of Mr. Giles, the principal draper in the town, and nearly opposite was the only ironmonger's, kept then and for many years afterwards by Newhall, then Whale, and so on. Hammond's toyshop was a big butcher's, kept by Cook, afterwards Harding. Another flourishing butcher was Smith at the Market Head, but the most important of all was Bassett in Church Street. Dinmore's rope warehouse has sur vived \u2014 almost the only relic of Powis Street in 1840. In Hare Street, Bland the butcher remains, but where is his rival, Cornish ? The only poulterer in Woolwich at that time was Greenwood in High Street ; and Morgan, in the same street, kept the largest baker's shop. It is there now, close to Plaisted's tavern. Trade had begun to move southward along Green's End in 1841. The principal auctioneer, Mr. Austin, had his office where now is located Mr. Hughes, M.P., solicitor ; the Round House was built soon after, and Mr. E. Jones kept the principal post-office at \" The Library,\" which was then the lounge of military officers, and is now the Kentish Independent office. The western side of Wellington Street was then formed of private houses, and the eastern side, unbuilt upon, was still the Sappers' Green ; the streets were lighted with tbe oil lamps which had been in vogue for two hundred years, and a few remained even in 1849. The last was in Union Street. The Coming Dawn. \u2014 Hitherto the march of progress had been a laggard pace, but about this period new aspirations prevailed, and another era began to dawn. The laws of health were diligently and in telligently studied, and the unsanitary state of things, which bad been endured in the past as quite of the natural order, were seen and exposed in all their horrible deformity. There was an almost entire absence of drainage prior to 1853. The governing bodies had been talking of it for twenty years, and on the 10th of October, 1843, a serious discussion had taken place on the question. The idea at that time was to drain Brewer Street only at a cost of \u00a3400, but the whole town was said to have been in a filthy state for want of drainage. The curbing and chanelling of some of the streets was at that time in progress, but it was not for many years that the general paving of the footpaths was accomplished. In a local guide-book, published by Mr. Ruegg in 1847, there is this impeachment : \u2014 The town is in a state of unparalleled prosperity, but is perhaps the dirtiest, filthiest, and most thoroughly mismanaged town of its size in the kingdom. No town presents"], [172, "80 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. greater facilities for cleanliness, nearly all the streets being elevated ; but there is hardly a public sewer in the parish, and the channels are allowed to become the recep tacles of all kinds of filth. The Great Ten Years. \u2014 This state of affairs, being as bad as possible, was bound to mend, and circumstances helped the reformation. There is no denying that the most important decade in the history of Woolwich and the locality was that which followed the year 1850, but to these ten years ought justly to be added the five preceding and the five succeeding ones to cover the approaching and subsiding gradients of activity. Public Inquiries. \u2014 In 1845 there was a Governmental inquiry at Woolwich by Captain Denison, R.E., one of the Commissioners for inquiring into the state of large towns, and he had recommended an efficient and thorough system of drainage, a proper and adequate water supply, the construction of public baths, and a better paving and cleansing ofthe streets. But little, if anything, was done, and matters did not progress much beyond the stage of discussion until a second and more effective investigation was made in 1848, by Mr. Robert Rawlinson, Superintending Inspector of the General Board of Health, who was sent down in response to a forcible petition, subscribed to by the Rev. W. Greenlaw, Rector, and four hundred and forty inhabitants \u2014 being more than ten per cent, of tbe rated inhabitants, who were under four thousand. The petition appears to have been an exhaustive statement of the case, and bears the evident impress of Mr. Ruegg's hand. It stated that there were at that time six thousand troops in the garrison, and three thousand men employed in the Dockyard and Arsenal. It was a critical period, and demands a new chapter."], [173, ""], [174, "face page 81. Woolwich in 1840. PLATE XIV."], [175, "Hog Lane (Nile Street), Woolwich.

The Public Health. \u2014 It is but fair to say that the inhabitants had at last become thoroughly roused to the necessity of vigorous action to improve their sanitary state, and free the town from its discreditable condition and character. But the primary need had been an increase of powers enabling them to raise capital wherewith to carry out all the improvements demanded. In 1848 the Public Health Act was passed, and to that Act, aided by the courage and self-sacrifice of the generation which is passing away, Woolwich owed its new birth. At that time the town was still under the local acts of 1807-8, and the Commissioners, thirty-three in number, did their best to administer its weak and ancient rules.

Setting to Work. \u2014 To these Commissioners, and to some others who will be hereafter named, the official investigation and the early application of the Public Health Act to Woolwich are in the main due, with all the many and great advantages which have resulted there from. To understand what this means it is needful to realise the state of Woolwich at the time, and for this purpose the evidence given before Mr. Rawlinson must be cited : Dr. F. Bossey produced tables relating to the mortality, and showed that, after deducting the convict establishment, the death rate was 22 per 1,000, while in Lewishamit was but 17, his inference being that out of the 36,000 people in Wool wich, 180 died prematurely every year. This he showed was traceable to the worst conditioned parts of the town by the following figures : \u2014 District. Population. Persons Deaths in Fevers, Proportion of per house. 4\u00a3 years. &c. deaths per 1000. Woolwich Common, &c. . . 842 6*4 53 13 13*8 High Street, &c. . . . 1,754 7*0 134 41 17*0 Union Gardens, &c. . . . 697 5*5 72 29 22*9 Cannon Row, &c. . . . 804 6*6 97 31 26*8 These facts proved a startling excess of mortality in the lower districts of the town, and Dr. Bossey traced various causes, especially heaps of foul refuse in dustmen's yards, filth in open ditches and gutters, an over-filled churchyard, defective water supply, overcrowding of dwellings, and especially the great tract of marsh land at Plumstead, which presented many acres of stagnant water and undrained bog. To this he attributed the great prevalence of ague, fevers, jaundice, neuralgia, and other diseases of the liver and spleen, and he stated that in 1847 out of 420 convicts in the Justitia, 405 attacks occurred."], [177, "83 WOOLWICH. Dr. J. Butler corroborated Dr. F. Bossey, and said that the prevalence of dysentery and diarrh\u0153a might be alleviated by the better drainage of the houses. Dr. Prater said the town was completely riddled with cesspools, and many inhabi tants had typhus repeatedly, while cholera and erysipelas found the town a very hot bed. Dr, Peter Bossey said that in Hare Street there was no sewer, and the butchers and fishmongers emptied their slops into the street every morning. The blood and offal from the slaughterhouses flowed down the open gutters. In Myrtle Place, for instance, there was an open gutter along which the house drainage ran. The cesspools in many places were pumped out into the street. Dr. AArm. Stuart and Dr. Macintosh, of the Royal Artillery, gave similar evidence. Colonel Dundas spoke especially of the injury resulting from the marsh malaria, and said that he could not live in the Arsenal. Mr. R. Ruegg was then examined at length. He pointed out that the seven thousand soldiers of the garrison were chiefly young and healthy men, and ought to be deducted from the mortality tables, which would make the death rate much higher. In the spring of 1848, as many as four thousand persons were attacked with disorders of the zymotic class in AVoolwich and Plumstead, due in his opinion entirely to the marshes. Mr. George Hudson said the drainage from Red Lion Street and Mulgrave Place flowed over the surface and came down Brewer and AVilliani Streets, the effluvia being so bad that he could scarcely open his windows. Surgeon Davis, R.A., said Barrack Court, beyond the Mill in Mill Lane,* was very unhealthy, and other courts near the Barracks were nearly as bad. The Government provided one hundred cottages on the Common for married soldiers, and these were kept very clean and healthy, t A special report on ague, which was then so prevalent at AVoolwich and Plumstead, was presented by Dr. Peter Bossey, who said there had been that year numberless cases, affecting grown persons, children, and even infants. This he ascribed to the increasing defects of the marsh lands, which the owners of cattle had dammed up to prevent the entrance of salt water, and thereby hindered the drainage. Ague and low fever spread even over the higher ground, and in Hopgood's Cottages, newly built above the Slade, he had attended twenty-six cases within a few weeks. He found that in 1778, of 632 convicts in the hulks no less than 142 died in eleven months of fever, which broke out after they had worked ashore below AVoolwich. The question of the water supply was then gone into. The mains of the Kent Water Company had been extended into the town, but the charge was very high (5s. to 7s. 6d. per room per annum), and the water was deficient in quantity. It was pumped from the Ravensbourne, and was said to be bad in quality also. Mr. Hethrington said he got water from a cart in the street at three pails a penny. Mr. Ruegg said very few of the houses in the town took the company's water. The Kent Water Company forwarded a statement setting forth that they supplied 1,720 houses in AVoolwich. They also said that the AVoolwich Commissioners had in 1808 contracted with Boulton and Watt for a steam pumping engine, and taken a lease of some springs from Sir T. M. Wilson for ninety-nine years at the yearly rent of \u00a3105, but had not supplied a house or laid a pipe. The company in 1811 bought the lease of them for \u00a32,625, but the springs were worthless ; and they also bought the steam engine for \u00a31,000, and found that it had never been unpacked. Like the springs it was useless, and was afterwards sold for \u00a3500. * The site of the Auxiliary and Female Hospitals. t The huts near the camp, afterwards visited with diphtheria, and pulled down in 1875."], [178, "84 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. It was also stated by the company that they supplied all the Government buildings, and had constructed for the Government in 1844 the reservoir on Woolwich Common for the extinction of fire. The crowded state of the churchyard, in which burials were then permitted, was also the subject of inquiry, and some scandalous details were given. Of the attention paid to the roads, Captain Denison's report furnishes the following evidence : \u2014 The materials of which the streets or roadways of Woolwich are composed render any attempt to cleanse or sweep them unavailing. A loose, badly-binding gravel, procured in the neighbourhood,* in summer is soon reduced to dust and in winter to mud, and is washed away by heavy rains into the gutters, choking them up and causing their contents to be spread over the roadway ; and what is called cleansing the roads consists in emptying and cleaning out these gutters and throwing the contents back again into the roadway. The following statistics are extracted from this report : \u2014 Table of Burials Registered at Woolwich Church.

The terrible death-rate in the Arsenal district may well have cried out for inquiry and redress.

Verdict and Sentence. \u2014 The ultimate conclusion of Mr. Raw linson was an utter condemnation of the existing arrangements, and his emphatic recommendation was that the Public Health Act of 1818 should be forthwith adopted at Woolwich.

Withdrew. The Drainage. \u2014 Having appointed as their clerk and solicitor Messrs. E. Sargent and W. Nokes, tbe two officials of the defunct Commissioners, tbe Board advertised for a competent surveyor, and Mr. John Barnett was elected out of a large number of candidates. Other advisers were also called in to help with their experience, and the main drainage of the town was at once started. The excellent"], [181, "87 WOOLWICH. sanitary condition of the parish at the present time has been purchased at the following cost : \u2014 Loan of \u00a316,500 at 4 per cent., 23rd August, 1853. \u201e \u00a32,000 at 5 \u201e 31st March, 1857. \u201e .\u00a33,000 at 5 \u201e 13th March, 1865. \u00a321,500 Tbe loans were borrowed for thirty years of the Royal Exchange Assurance Company, and have thus been borne with something like fairness by a succession of ratepayers. The highest annual rate made by the Board reached seven shillings and sixpence in the pound in 1870 ; the lowest four shillings and sixpence, in 1860. These sums do not include the Private Improvement Rate, which was simply a repayment made by the house-owners of the money advanced by the Local Board for private works connected with the drainage, and spread over thirty years. The Crimean War-time. \u2014 Decisive action came only just in time, for in 1854 the great War with Russia broke out, the demand for warlike productions enormously increased, the population multiplied at a marvellous bound, and, although Woolwich has had its stages of depression since, it may safely date from 1854 a strength and standing to which it never before attained, and from which it has never yet descended. But it was not alone the Crimean War which brought this change. The duty of improving and maintaining the national defences had begun to be recognised, and gradually to affect the productive power of the national Arsenal, some years prior to that event, and Woolwich was progressing numerically and commercially before the Emperor Nicholas defied the Powers of Europe. It was progressing also in another and no less important direction. The Age of Intellect. \u2014 To the first half of the nineteenth century will ever belong a principal share in the glory of scientific achievements. It witnessed the development of Steam and Railways, the discovery of the Electric Telegraph, the growth of universal Educa tion, Political Liberty, and a Free Press. It was the era of literary institutions, the season of sanitary enlightenment, when cleanliness and temperance began to be taught as essential elements in the physical and intellectual advancement of the people, and it will ever be a satis factory reflection to Woolwich that among all the towns of England she, at this momentous crisis, was not found wanting. Men of Enterprise. \u2014 The generation which so promptly and energetically led the enterprise of Woolwich to early triumphs in the establishment of steamboat companies, gas companies, and such-Kke"], [182, "88 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. undertakings for the public welfare, could not be devoid of men of capacity to deal with the health requirements of the population, and to these men we must admit that the town owes the credit of having been the first place in tbe whole Metropolis to accomplish a complete and efficient system of drainage. At first the sewers were discharged into the Thames at Trinity Street and Hog Lane (Nile Street), being stored in receivers until high tide, but in 1861 the Metropolis at large was also drained, and the Woolwich system was connected with the great outfall sewer which is carried away to Crossness. In consequence of having completed its drainage, Woolwich was specially exempted from most of the responsibilities imposed upon other Metropolitan parishes by the Metropolis Local Management Act of 1856. Never theless, it was for certain other purposes included in that Act and the subsequent Amendment Act, and the parish has always been represented by one member on the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Main Drainage of London.\u2014 The town, however, had to pay for the privilege of connecting with the great outfall, and has had more than its share of the annoyance of that effusion, by having it in such close vicinity. The creation of this enormous sewer through Woolwich caused less inconvenience than might have been expected, as it was done chiefly by tunnelling. Underground Woolwich. \u2014 In July, 1861, a few weeks before the completion of the work, a large party of the contractor's staff and their friends amongst the tradesmen and inhabitants of Woolwich, descended to explore the great tunnel, and held a jovial meeting under the dome where the principal junction exists in the centre of the town, which is near the Board Schools in Powis Street. Having provided themselves with plenty of champagne and other requisites for a jolly evening, they held high festival for several hours, the band of the 4th Rent Rifle Volunteers (the town corps) assisting to wake the subterranean echoes in the bowels of Old Woolwich. The outfall sewer, as it passes through the town, is eleven feet in diameter. Steam Ferry. \u2014 No other work of such magnitude as the sewer has been seen at Woolwich in our time, but the Free Steam Ferry across the Thames promises to be one of the grandest accomplishments the town has ever achieved. It was decided upon by the Metropolitan Board in 1885, and ordered to be carried out at the cost of the whole Metropolis, as a set-off for the bridges provided in the more favoured west ; but nearly three years were consumed in negotiations, arbitra tions, and preparations. Paving. \u2014 Previously to 1863 the town was unpaved, except in"], [183, "View ofthe River from Woolwich. PLATE XV. [To face page 88.]"], [184, ""], [185, "89 WOOLWICH. one or two places, including the footpath which led up New Road towards the Barracks, and was called, par excellence, \" The Pavement.\" But in that year the Local Board summoned courage to incur another loan of \u00a37,000, and paved the paths throughout with a course of York stone four feet wide. The Freehold Of Woolwich. \u2014 Public improvements at Woolwich have been greatly impeded by tbe land tenure. For the greater part of this century the bulk of the freehold of Woolwich has been held by the Ogilby family. Mr. James Ogilby, who died about 1885, resided in Ireland, and took so little interest in the town which he may be said to have almost owned, that he for the last fifty years of his life refused not only to sell any of his freehold but even to grant any extension of lease, being determined to leave the property, just as it was, to his heir. In 1898 the reversions will fall in."], [186, "CHAPTER VIII. ENTERPRISE. A.D. 1849. \u2014 In 1849, when junior imp of a printing office, and the humble servant of two proprietors and fifteen printers, I had an obscure part in the production of a \"Woolwich Directory,\" probably the first which the town had ever seen. The issue was not a large one and the demand was not ravenous \u2014 circumstances which are to my present advantage, seeing that I have preserved a rare book. The contents of this Directory have peculiar charms for such as care to dwell upon the memories of the past, to conjure up the spirits of the old familiar men and women of the generation that has gone away, and to recall in a vivid presence their active lives, their words and works. Every page, it is true, is full of regrets ; it is like walking through a street of the dead, and losing one's self in a reverie among the tombs of departed friends. But, apart from its sad sermon on bfe and death, my Directory is a grand record of good men and noble achievements. The Men Of '49. \u2014 It is to these men of 1849 that Woolwich owes her early commercial prosperity, her many public undertakings and beneficial enterprises, and the inestimable blessings of health and com fort which, notwithstanding primary and inherent disadvantages, the town and the people have enjoyed for many years in advance of other towns, even those included, like Woolwich, within the girth of modern London. By promptly recognising and adopting the Public Health Act of 1848, our fathers not only rescued their parish from a state of sanitary degradation and affliction, and raised it to a respectable level in the bills of mortality, but they also saved its inhabitants many of the heavy burdens afterwards cast upon their less fortunate or less pro vident neighbours. The main drainage of the town, the paving of the footpaths, the making of sound roads, the provision of plentiful water, the closing of the churchyard and the making of a cemetery, were all costly undertakings, and needed some courage and self-denial at each successive plunge ; but, fortunately for us, the right men were in the right places at tbe right time, and, carefully but fearlessly, step by step onward, they took upon themselves the obligation of loan after loan, and, undeterred by the pessimism which was called \"prudence,\" they carried out everything to which they set their hands. And, for the thirty years in which they and we have been paying off the debt, we have"], [187, "ilst.. i?_ ilf..Z Lane, 1845. Old Road at Plumstead, 1886. [To face page 90.] PLATE XVI."], [188, ""], [189, "91 WOOLWICH together reaped the profit. Woolwich is not all that it might be even now, but, considering its lowly origin, its sickly childhood, and its neglected youth, the men of the mid-century may be said to have brought it fairly out of its troubles and given it a vigorous manhood, which, in spite of its unshapely form and features, is likely to endure. Our fathers, at any rate, did better than their fathers, and still better than their grandfathers, who seem to have lived and died under the impression that the world was made especially for them, and never dreamt of leaving it better than they found it. Many of the \"improve ments \" which have lately faced us, and some which still face us, are but corrections of ancestral blunders. Mr. Richard Ruegg. \u2014 When Woolwich, in 1861, presented to Mr. Richard Ruegg a handsome testimonial, an acknowledgment was made more truthful than testimonials usually are. It typified the satisfaction of the town at the fulfilment of the measures which he had been one of the first to advocate and promote, especially the drainage and the paving. As a deep and thoughtful reader, a scholar, a man of scientific acquirements, an able writer, and a good debater, he had been for many years engaged in stimulating the inhabitants to action \\>y all the means within reach, including the newspaper which he edited, the Kentish Independent; and, when the time came for making up their minds, the people knew at least something about the merits of the question. Mr. W. P. Jackson. \u2014 At every step Mr. Ruegg was warmly sup ported by his friend and coadjutor on the Press, Mr. William Parry Jackson, then in part, and afterwards wholly, proprietor of the newspaper just named. Mr. Jackson served many years upon the Local Board of Health, and was for an unexampled period its chairman, besides repre senting the town on the Metropolitan Board and discharging other prominent duties.* Mr. George Hudson. \u2014 Another worker who was early in the field, and rendered most valuable service, was Mr. George Hudson, whose practical knowledge of surveying and business experience were of essen tial benefit to the parish at such a juncture. The Rev. William Greenlaw, Rector of Woolwich, and his two churchwardens, Messrs. Morgan and Roff, were also well in front at this stirring time ; and special mention might be made of other zealous public men, including indeed the whole of the Commissioners then in office. Mr. Thomas Morgan. \u2014 Mr. Thomas Morgan, who had a share in the destinies of the place for nearly ninety years, was long known affectionately as \" the father of Woolwich.\" He was born in High * The position to which Mr. Jackson attained unquestionably entitles him to a leading place in these records.

Street on the 20th February, 1796, and carried on the business of a baker in the same street from 1822 to 1855. He devoted much of his life to the town, serving all the parochial offices, being an early mem ber of the Board of Commissioners, and the first chairman of the Local Board of Health. He was an active supporter of the Woolwich Savings Bank, the special friend of the parish almshouses, and no man was ever more sincerely esteemed for his kindness of heart and unswerv ing honesty of purpose. In his time, and largely by his means, a new town grew out of the old Woolwich, and its period of highest develop ment, during which most of its houses were built and its general improv ment accomplished, was fortunate in having his guiding hand. He survived this busy era for many years, his bright intellect and cheer ful manner remaining to edify and delight his friends, and many records of Woolwich have I gathered from his lips. Full of years and univer sally respected, he died at his residence in Brewer Street on the 17th of November, 1884, and he was reverently laid to rest three days later in St. Thomas's churchyard.

In 1860 commenced practice as solicitor at Woolwich, and was the same year elected on Local Board. Had been secretary to Mutual Building Society for five years, but now assisted to found the Woolwich, Plumstead, and Charl- ton (now Kent and Surrey) Building Society, and became its solicitor. Was also appointed Conservative agent for the Woolwich district ; was in 1863 elected Vestry Clerk of Plumstead, .and has several times had a seat upon the Plumstead District Board ; was a director of the Woolwich Steamboat Company and of the Consumers' Gas Company. In 1862 was commissioned second lieutenant of Plumstead Volunteer Artillery. As a political .agent he is credited with the Conservative supremacy in the County of Kent and City of London, having conducted the registration and many elections in both. He was instrumental in winning first one and then both of the seats in the Borough of Greenwich, and on the formation of the Borough of Wool-"], [201, ""], [202, "PLATE XVII Mr. T. W. Boord. M.P.

In 1715 the following return was presented to Parliament, purporting to be a list of freeholders, between the age of twenty-one and seventy years, within the town half hundred of Blackheath, having estates of \u00a310 a year. Woolwich Dockyard and Eopeyard Officers, viz. : Mr. John Hayward, Master Shipwright ; Mr. Joseph Downes, Assistant ; Mr. John Smith, Storekeeper ; Mr. Jethro Barton, Master Ropemaker ; Mr. James Felton, Storekeeper to ye Warren ; Jonas Hardyng, Gentleman ; John Hammond, mealman ; John AA7atson, potter ; Richard Hammond, mealman ; Thomas Rose, baker ; John Pullman, shipwright ; Matthew Cartwright, cooper ; Joseph Shortrouch, shipwright ; Benjamin Slading, shipwright ; Edward Gray, shipwright ; Thomas Bartrum, ropemaker ; John Hos kins, shipwright ; Richard Cooley, shipwright (Signed) A. Reynolds, R. Cavell, Petty Constables. This list probably does not mention the whole of the \u00a310 freeholders, and I doubt that all those named were in the Government service. The Borough of Greenwich. \u2014 But even when the borough was formed in 1832, the persons entitled to vote were only 741 in AVoolwich, 87 in Charlton, and 47 in the part of Plumstead which came within the boundary \u2014 this being a line drawn from the Storekeeper's house to the stile at the top of Sandy Hill. In 1840 the full register of the borough gave the following electors : \u2014 Greenwich, 1,371 ; St. Paul, Deptford, 932 ; St. Nicholas, Deptford, 319 ; Woolwich, 1,049 ; Charlton, 91 ; Plumstead, 48. Total, 3,810. The greater part of the growing parish of Plumstead was omitted until 1868, when the Boundary Commissioners took the whole of it into the Borough of Greenwich. The Borough of Woolwich was constituted in 1885, and the number of voters on register may be given to contrast with the figures of 1832 : Woolwich, 4,012 ; Plumstead, 5,064 ; to which must be added Eltham, 693. Charlton, which is within the limits of the newly defined Borough of Greenwich, has just over 1,100 voters. The First Great Struggle. \u2014 In 1835, half a century before Woolwich became a separate borough, it was engaged in its first serious political battle. There had been the election of 1832, of course, to constitute the new Parliament under the Reform Act, but on that occasion all the candidates were Liberals, and the newly fledged electors had hardly had sufficient time to realise their privileges. Even thus wich, was himself returned as its first member of Parliament. Was in 1877 gazetted Lieutenant-Colonel of the 2nd Kent Artillery Volunteers, which he had raised from a single battery of thirty-seven members to a brigade of 480.

November 18th, 1832.\u2014 A meeting was held at the Abercrombie Arms, when the gallant candidate, Captain AY. Deans Dundas, was introduced. The Artillery band played many airs and several toasts were given, and at a late hour the party sepa rated, full of good wine and good humour. This will be a successful canvass. It is the only jolly, joyous, musical, social, spirited, and becoming electioneering meeting we have had to record. But it was reserved for 1835 to witness the first daring attempt of a Torj- invasion and a real strug gle. The Liberal candidates were Mr. Barnard and Mr. John Angerstein, and to their attack came the terrible Con servative, Mr. M. W. Attwood. Brib ery and C orruption. \u2014 The battle waged is never to be forgotten. For weeks together there was strife and fun and excitement every day. Processions always moving, bands of music always play ing, unlimited silk given away sor flags and ribbons, and money flying about us freely as the colours \u2014 these were the ordinary experiences of elec tion times fifty years ago. Every publican thought it was necessary that he should have a committee sitting daily Admiral Dundas, M.P., 1847. in his club-room, and at many of them there was a free-drinking privilege known as \" open bouse \" sor several days before the polling. Without inferring that votes were bought and sold, it may be safely said that bribery and corruption were the law of elections in 1835. Their mildest form was the frequent present of a silk handkerchief in the colour of the candidate to the voter's wife ; and many of the tradespeople, who would have been horrified at a bribe, looked upon a substantial order for goods from the candidate of their fancy as quite a proper thing. Nomination and Polling. \u2014 At that time there was only one hust ings, which stood in the open space beside St. Alphage Church at Green wich, and everybody went there to vote. Nearly all the voters went there"], [205, "W00LAVICH. 105 also on the day before the polling to hold up both their hands at the nomination (generally known as the \" show of hands \"), and on the day after the poll they went again to hear the declaration. Hustings at Woolwich. \u2014 The nomination and the declaration of the poll were continued at Greenwich until, the new plan -of election was adopted in 1868, but the necessity of going -to Greenwich to vote was avoided after two or three elections by the provision of hust ings at Woolwich. Until 1851, or a little later, these hustings were built on the Mar ket Hill in High Street, but Beres ford Square was afterwards selected as a more suitable spot. Of course there was no secret vot- ing in. those days. Indeed, in 1835, a Greenwich paper printed the entire poll-hook of the election, showing how every elector voted. We may say a little more about this election of 1835. The poll lasted two days, and tbe three can didates stood in the hustings to thank the voters as they came to General Codrington, M.P., 1857 poll. There was a great multitude, and vast excitement, people shout ing, and bands playing, colours flying, and frequent fights.

The church bells A Borough Election, 1852. were rung, and guns were fired, not only on Woolwich Common, but at the residence of Mr. Nokes, in Mulgrave Place (he was Mr. Angerstein's agent) and at other places. The day wound up with dinners and conviviality everywhere. The Champion at the Feast. \u2014 Amongst the rest \u2014 A dinner was held at the Crown and Anchor to celebrate the return to Parlia ment of Mr. J. Angerstein, whose son, Col. Angerstein, was present. Mr. J. Butler was chairman, and about a hundred gentlemen sat down to dinner. During the proceedings the attention of the com pany was arrested by a most interesting exhibition. The champion of Mr Anger stein, armed at all points, and bearing a shield with the honourable member's arms, made his appearance, and, having proceeded to the chair, drank a bumper of wine to the health of Mr. Angerstein, member for the Borough of Greenwich, Mr. W.

The health of the"], [208, "108 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. other member of the borough, Mr. E. G. Barnard, was also given, and that of Mr. Nokes, who remarked that the 9th of January was a day never to be forgotten. A Mr. Jolly, he said, had laid the foundation of the building by giving the first vote to Mr. Angerstein, and he should propose Mr. Jolly's health. Mr. Jolly returned thanks. (This was Mr. R. Jolly, father of Mr. J. R. Jolly, J.P.) Political Variations.\u2014 It is unnecessary to describe all the subsequent elections, though each has had its peculiar features. The sketch on the preceding page illustrates one of the most remarkable of the struggles, that of 1852, when for the first time since 1837 (when Mr. Att wood was returned), a Conser vative (Mr. Peter Eolt) wrested one of the seats from the Liberals.

Sarges and Tilt Boats. \u2014 The above woodcut, taken from a sketch made by Canot in 1753, shows the favourite mode of travelling between \"Woolwich and London during the last century. The tilt boats, as they were described, sailed with the tide, and our fathers have told us of the strange hours at which they were accustomed to embark. In their time, speaking of say 1830, three of these boats were sufficient for the public requirements, and they occupied three hours on the journey. Many old residents remember when there were but two of these boats daily, one owned by Mr. Sales, and the other by Mr. Spurling, starting \" as the tide suits,\" night or day. At the time of Canot, however, one such conveyance was probably enough. Each was prohibited from carrying more than ten passengers; and at one period the law required that two vacant places should be reserved for persons who might be picked up on the way. Fares by Water. \u2014 I have not ascertained the amount of the fare in 1753, but I have a \" \"Waterman's Table from Windsor to Woolwich \" of 1813, which states that the legal charge from London Bridge to Woolwich was, at that time, five shillings. The predecessors of the tilt boats were either watermen's wherries, hired by special bargain, or barges which carried passengers and merchandise together. A Penny Ride. \u2014 In 1562, when money values were many times higher than at present, the fare from London to Woolwich by barge was one penny each person, and to Gravesend twopence. A wherry man"], [217, "115 AVOOLWICH. was not permitted to charge more than a shilling all told for the journey from London Bridge to Woolwich, working two oars.* Until stage coaches were started, Government officials, and such as were able to afford the luxury, kept their own boats and boatmen. Stage Coaches. \u2014 A stage coach ran daily to London and back from an early dates having its town rendezvous in Gracechurch Street. A road book of 1807 has a table showing that coaches from London to Woolwich started as follows : \u2014 From Morning. Afternoon. Swan, Charing Cross ... 9 \u2014 12 3 \u2014 8 Hope, do. ... 9 11 \u2014 368 Cross Keys, Gracechurch Street . \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 6 \u2014 Horse Shoe and Magpie, Bridge } q 1 9 q Street, Westminster . - ) Kings and Key, Fleet Street . 10 11 \u2014 3 6 8 In addition to the above there were several coaches daily passing over Shooters' Hill to Gravesend and Dover, and many poor people were conveyed in carriers' waggons. Rival Coaches. \u2014 It appears from the following paragraph that competition sprang up and was followed by some of its consequences. Sept. 16, 1822. \u2014 On Monday morning the Tally Ho of Woolwich, opposition coach, actuated by that spirit of rivalry which has of late been fatal to so many lives, had the temerity to pass down Blackheath Hill J at full gallop. About midway down the hill it was throw*n over with such violence that the side was driven in and broken to pieces. There w*ere fifteen passengers, eleven outside and four inside, all of whom, without exception, received serious injury. Of Major McLeod, who was a passenger and a very fine young man, little hope3 are entertained. Not one escaped without broken legs or arms, and several will, it is feared, lose their lives. Omnibuses. \u2014 Omnibuses were put on the road about 1830, and these also had their opposition to contend against. Shillibeer, who claimed to be the inventor of the omnibus, and afterwards rose to fame as the pioneer of cheap funerals, issued the following advertisement in April, 1835 :\u2014 Shillibeer's AVoolwich Omnibuses. \u2014 G. Shillibeer has the pleasure to announce that in consequence of the monopolizing spirit exhibited by his rivals, and to afford the inhabitants of AA'oolwich greater facility of conveyance, eight of his Greenwich omnibuses will leave AVoolwich daily for Oxford Street, Islington, and the City, and, to prevent collisions with his rivals, will start from the Star and Garter, Powis Street, at a quarter before or after the hours, calling at the Crown and Cushion and Globe * Cawood's Rates and Fares. t There were probably some such conveyances early in the eighteenth century, and the coaches from London to Dover by way of Shooters' Hill were available earlier still. X Blackheath Hill in the olden times is illustrated at page 16."], [218, "116 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Taverns, and proceed without delay or changing vehicles, as hitherto, to their respec tive destinations. To compete with the steamers, the fares from Woolwich to London will be reduced to one shilling. To his patrons at Greenwich thus Shillibeer writes, Or at least to his Laureat the poet indites : The omnibus I first invented all know, And abolished bad language as vulgar and low And my orders are, always behave to each fare With obliging attention, politeness, and care. It gives me much pleasure when this is the case, And I never allow them to gallop or race, Nor to loiter and wait and then rattle away, At the risk of your life, as was done every day. At the Star and the Garter from Woolwich I start, From the corner of Nelson Street, Greenwich, depart ; And old Centurion, Deptford, at the end of High Street, Are the place, my friends may my carriages meet. (In all ten verses.) Steamboats. \u2014 Circumstances were, however, too strong for the gifted Shillibeer. The steamboats gradually but surely superseded the coaches and omnibuses, though some (or at least one) of them, con tinued to run a precarious trade in the face of fate as lately as 1844, in which year we read that \u2014 Mr. George Green's four-horse coach was turning the corner at the head of Powis Street, AVoolwich, when the driver fell from his box and was run over and killed. Greenwich Railway. \u2014 When the railway was made from London Bridge to Greenwich, the coaches from Woolwich, with rare exceptions, went to Greenwich only. A local \" Guide \" of 1837 informs us that \u2014 Omnibuses start from the Crown and Anchor every half-hour, and vans every hour from the same spot, as far as the railway terminus at Greenwich. The First Steamer. \u2014 The Woolwich Steam-Packet Company was established in 1834, and was of great benefit to the town. Its first boat was the Sylph, and the following was one of its early advertise ments : \u2014 AVoolwich steam-packets, Fairy, Sylph, and Naiad, continue to run every day from Woolwich : morning at 9, afternoon at 2 ; from Hungerford Market* : morning at II, afternoon at 4 ; and will embark and disembark without the use of boats.

Fancy Names.\u2014 In 1837 the company had five boats, the Ariel being added to its fleet, and it may be observed that for every vessel which they built the company found an appropriate and kindred name, each one representing a sprite, and each one being formed of five letters. In 1837 the boats made four or five passages per day in Woolwich Piers in 1838. winter and seven or eight in summer, calling at Greenwich and Queen hithe. The Watermen's Company. \u2014 The success of the company and its competition with the scullers induced the latter to start a rival con cern, called the \"\"Watermen's Steam- Packet Company,\" and a strife began which nearly ruined both, but resulted in the older concern buy ing up and absorbing its weaker antagonist. The Watermen's pier was run out from their stairs at Bell Watergate, close to the Woolwich Company's pier at Strother's (now Ross's) Wharf as seen in the accom panying sketch. The Watermen also had their poet, who took up the strains of Dibdin and sang : \u2014"], [220, "118 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Now all the world flocks to the jolly steam watermen, From London to Woolwich through water they fly, And they paddle along with such ease and dexterity Charming each heart and delighting each eye. They look so neat and they run so steadily ; The ladies all flock to these boats so readily, And walk fore and aft with so charming an air, The Watermen ne'er are in want of the fair. The Piers. \u2014 The present pier was constructed subsequently to 1837, in which year, on November 10th, appears on the rolls of Parlia ment a \u2014 Notice to bring in a bill next sessions for a pier or jetty on the south of the Thames at Woolwich, between Globe Lane and the Dockyard, with approaches from High Street. The Railways. \u2014 There was certainly no room for local rivalries, seeing that formidable railway opponents were threatening on both sides of the river. The North Kent line was proposed in 1835, and Woolwich resented it with all its might. The following report of a meeting held on the subject, in 1836, deserves to become historical. At a very numerous and highly respectable private meeting of the house proprietors, owners of properties, tradesmen, and other inhabitants of the parish of Woolwich, on Friday, the 5th of February, 1836, to adopt measures in opposition to the project of a railroad from Greenwich to Gravesend passing through Woolwich (Sir John Webb, K.C.B., in the chair), the following resolutions were unanimously agreed to : \u2014 Besolved, on the motion of Mr. Colquhoun, seconded by Mr. Church \u2014 That the line of the Greenwich and Gravesend Railroad through the town of Woolwich in the manner proposed, by the excavation of an open ditch or cut of considerable width and depth, will be extremely injurious to the inhabitants. Resolved, on the motion of Mr. Samuel Noble, seconded hy Mr. Henry Fish \u2014 That it does not appear that in any similar instance in railroad speculations that any such excavation or cut has ever been attempted through a town so densely populated, and that if the same be permitted there will be an end to the safety of persons and property. Resolved, on the motion of Mr. Lewis Davis, seconded by Mr. Thomas Parkes \u2014 That the proposed line of road will be a nuisance to the town, deprive the inhabitants of the benefits derived from the several springs, prevent a proper drainage, throw difficulties in the way of communication for gas and water, destroy numerous valu able properties, and render others valueless ; that the said plan is unnecessary, uncalled for, unsightly, ruinous, unparalleled, and altogether destructive of the town and the interests of its community, and that the said bill be opposed. The Railway Rejected.\u2014 The bill was, for the time, thrown out, and on the 8th of March following it was resolved at another meeting \u2014 That the grateful thanks of this meeting are due to James Colquhoun, Esq., of Woolwich, solicitor, for his able opposition to the bill for making a railroad from London to Gravesend, by the successful opposition whereof the town of Woolwich has"], [221, "119 WOOLWICH. been preserved from the destruction and ruin contemplated by the above-named project. The Railways Triumphant. \u2014 The \" preservation \" was, however, only for a few years longer, and when the inevitable railways came they were right welcome. The first line to Woolwich, however, was not the North Kent, but the North Woolwich branch of the Eastern Counties (now Great Eastern) Company, which was opened in 1847. The South Eastern Company's North Kent line was opened in the summer of 1849.* The North Kent Cutting. \u2014 The cutting of the North Kent Railway did not have the fearful consequences which were contem plated, but it effected several other collateral changes, some of which ought to have been averted. The level crossing in Sand Street and the constriction of John Street were both unnecessary, but the drying-up of the ponds by the Dockyard Station was a decided advantage. It has been already stated that King Street and Coleman Street were con tinuous on the western side until the railway cut through and made an opening for North Kent Terrace, and two or three houses and shops were in like manner cleared away in Green's End. The plans of tbe railway, dated 1846, are to be seen in the Boyal Artillery Library, where also is a good copy of the map made for the Town Commissioners in 1843. Water Journey. \u2014 Steamboat travellers may read old Stow's description of places on the Thames in his day (1720). He commences with Gravesend, \" Where the Lord Maior's jurisdiction begins.\" \" Gravesend,\" saith Stow, \" is a place of great resort, being the common landing place for strangers and seamen in their passage to London ; as likewise the accus tomary place of taking of shipping and the ready road for France. AU which doth occasion it to be well inhabited and resorted unto, and sufficiently furnished with inns, taverns, and other places of entertainment. And its markets, which are Wednesdays and Saturdays, are well provided ; yet all things want for no price. It is a maior town. Here is all the conveniency for travel for its inhabitants, either by water, or by land in the stage coaches or hackney horses, which are always to be had, either to London or Rochester, or elsewhere. \"Erith is a town of no great account. Opposite to this town in Essex is a place called Coldharbour. \" Raynham Creek on the side of Essex ; next to it is Dagenham Creek. About a mile and a half more westwards is the Halfway Tree in Essex side ; and over against in Kent is the Halfway House, so called as seated in the midway betwixt London and Gravesend. At Barking Creek two miles farther westward, and on the same side, is a lone house called \" the Devil's House,\" for wharreason I known not. Over against Woolwich in Essex side is Ham Creek, and about two miles more westwards is the river Lee.\" * This was only to London Bridge. The extension to Charing Cross was not opened until Jan. 11th, 1864."], [222, "120 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Latter-day Steamboats. \u2014 Notwithstanding all its troubles, the Woolwich Steam-Packet Company contrived to render good service to the town for many years, providing a cheap if somewhat slow con veyance for the inhabitants, and bringing down a vast number of visitors. It had rivals and other misfortunes, all of which it out lived, but in the year 1875 the enterprise was wrecked by London speculators, who, in an attempt to amalgamate the various steamboat services on the Thames, ruined them all. The Princess Alice disaster in 1878, and the foulness of the Thames, helped the evil fortunes of the river steamers, and now for some time the water service between Woolwich and London has been in a languishing and nearly dormant state. Railway Statistics. \u2014 The railways have, however, continued to flourish. From official information dated September, 1887, I find the average number of passengers daily from Woolwich to London and other up-stations to be \u2014 From the Arsenal Station about three thousand, and from the Dockyard, Station about two thousand. The arrivals are fairly represented by the same figures. The early workmen's trains have created a new traffic, the immigration of strangers far surpassing the emigration of inhabitants, consequent, no doubt, upon the exceptionally busy state of the Government works. Up passengers by early trains from Plumstead, 25 ; Arsenal Station, 75 ; Dock yard Station, 50. Down passengers from London, Deptford, Greenwich, &c., to Dockyard Station, 50 ; Arsenal Station, 500 ; Plumstead, 50. Building Societies. \u2014 The very earliest building society in the Metropolis arose in Woolwich, and it is prospering to-day. The germ was a small co-partnership which had its quarters in 1842 at the Castle Inn, the proprietor of which, Mr. Thunder, was the first chairman, the secretary being Mr. Evan Griffiths. Mr. Frederick Pearce and another were solicitors, Mr. Carrington surveyor. Mr. T. R. Richardson and other active members left the society in 1843, and formed another on improved principles, Mr. John Christie being chairman, Mr. W. Buchanan secretary, and Mr. Richardson a director, and this in 1847 became reconstituted on the \" permanent \" plan, under the name of the Woolwich Equitable Building Society, Mr. W. Stuart being the first chairman, and Mr. F. Pearce for a time both solicitor and secretary. For twenty-nine years Mr. Richardson was a director, and for eleven years chairman, resigning in 1887. Within the next few years the Woolwich Mutual Building Society, and the Woolwich, Plumstead, and Charlton, afterwards Kent and Surrey, Building Society, were set on foot, and have been in operation until now. Captain James Mutch, formerly of the Royal Engineers, was the first secretary of the"], [223, "121 AVOOLWICH. Mutual, and Mr. Geo. Bryceson has been the only secretary of the Kent and Surrey. Literary Institutions. \u2014 The first attempt at intellectual culti- vation of which we have any note was the establishment, in 1838, of a Literary, Scientific, and Practical Institution, which is said to have had two hundred members. The Moral and Intellectual Improvement Com- pany had its offices at 48, High Street, in 1848, and in the same year was started the \" Woolwich Mutual Improvement Society,\" which held its meetings at the Infant Schoolroom in Brewer Street. Mr. T. R. Bichard- son was its secretary until 1851, when its name was changed to that of the \" Woolwich Athen\u00e6um,\" and it died a natural death. In June, 1850, the Baths and Lecture Hall were opened in Nelson Street, and in high hopes the new \"Literary and Scientific Institution\" was established, being inaugurated by a great conversazione, at which Lord Derby and other distinguished persons assisted. It had for a time some success, its secretaries being Mr. Stephen Hudson, Mr. Edwin Hughes and others, but its career was for the most part a struggle, and, after spending its declining years in an upper room at No. 37, Green's End, it expired from inanition about 1872."], [224, "Sir Martin Bowes, Lord Mayor of London, 1545, CHAPTER XI CHARITIES AND CUSTOMS. The Goldsmiths' Almshouses. \u2014 Upwards of three hundred years ago (it was in the reign of Elizabeth \u2014 1560) Sir Martin Bowes, knight and goldsmith, a resident at Woolwich (and Lord Mayor of London), erected five almshouses opposite Warren Lane for poor persons over fifty years of age, and endowed them with a yearly income arising from estates devised for the purpose. The allowance to the occupants was \u00a31 Os. 5d. a year each, to be paid quarterly by the Goldsmiths' Company of London, who were to make an inspection annually between Midsummer and Michaelmas ; to have a sermon at the parish church, and to give the churchwardens 7s. and the poor lid. A tablet in the front of the centre house was inscribed \u2014 These almshouses were endowed by Sir Martin Bowes, Knight, who was Lord Mayor of London, 1545, and were rebuilt by the Company of Goldsmiths, London, in the year 1771.

Sir Martin Bowes. \u2014 Tradition has it that Sir Martin Bowes erected these almshouses in gratitude for the preservation of his son from drowning, but I find no evidence to confirm the suggestion. I have, however, been so fortunate as to discover Sir Martin's portrait, which appears at the head of this chapter. I have already expressed a belief that the good man resided in the mansion near the churchyard. The Parochial Almshouses. \u2014 The parochial almshouses in Rope yard Rails are themselves modern, but to get at their origin we must go back two hundred years. It was in 1679 that Sir William Pritchard* gave the ground which they occupy \"for the use of the poor,\" describ ing it as \" the ground at the back of Bowes's almshouses.\" Three small tenements appear to have been erected on the site, but in 1731 the trustees were authorised to pull them down and erect a workhouse there instead. Woolwich Workhouse. \u2014 The poorhouse presented in our illustra tion (plate xviii.) was accordingly built, and did its duty for more than a century. In the local act of 1808, previously quoted, authority was given to enlarge the workhouse or build a new one, as the structure was in many parts decayed, and insufficient for the accommodation and employment of the poor ; but the authority was never exercised, and matters continued in the same way until Woolwich was taken into the Greenwich Union. February 28, 1837. \u2014 A* meeting of the inhabitants in vestry was held to consider the proposal of the Commissioners of the parish regarding the order of the Poor Law Commissioners for uniting AVoolwich with Greenwich and Deptford, thereby displac ing the management and control of the poor, and to adopt such measures thereon as will prevent the removal of the poor from Woolwich. The union of the three parishes was vigorously but vainly opposed, and Woolwich in 1838 sent its representatives to the Greenwich Board of Guardians. The poor people continued at the old workhouse some months longer, and on January 17th, 1839, a letter was received from Mr. Bayly, one of the overseers of AVoolwich, which goes to show that the administration was as crude and simple as the building itself. Mr. Bayly informed the Guardians that he had been down to the Woolwich workhouse and seen the aged paupers, for want of knives and forks, \" holding the meat in their hands and tearing it to pieces with their teeth.\" The reply of the Guardians was that \" it was not customary to supply adult paupers with knives and forks.\" Next we read \u2014 February 20, 1839. \u2014 On Saturday the women and children in the workhouse ot Woolwich were removed in omnibuses to Greenwich. The scene was heartrending, and great disapprobation was evinced by the multitude. * I have searched for portraits of Sir WilUam Pritchard and other benefactors of old Woolwich, but without success."], [226, "124 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. The End Of the Workhouse. \u2014 The male inmates appear to have remained a while longer, but in January, 1841, the building was deserted and \u2014 A suggestion was made by Mr. Thunder at the Board of Commissioners, \"That the workhouse at Woolwich being, from the operation of the new poor law, no longer of service, should be devoted to the wants of the aged and unfortunate, and made an asylum for poverty, wretchedness, and infirmity.\" The Almshouses Started. \u2014 The proposition was heartily adopted, but two years were occupied in raising the necessary funds, and it was not until May 18th, 1843, that the announcement was made that \u2014 On the spot where the old workhouse stood will be erected ten almshouses, and on Friday last the foundation stone was laid by the Rev. W. Greenlaw, rector, assisted by Messrs. Morgan and Jolly, churchwardens, in the presence of a large concourse of the inhabitants. Mr. Clark of Walworth, formerly of Woolwich, materially assisted in the necessary funds. It was stated a week later that \u00a3143 had been raised, of which \u00a31 00 was given by Messrs. Peter and Edward Bossey. Mr. Thomas Clark contributed \u00a3200 towards the almshouses, and also invested \u00a33,000 in Consols for their support. Further, by bis will in 1861, he gave \u00a33,000 Consols, equal to \u00a390 a year, to be divided among the inmates annually. In 1847 Miss Anna Joanna Reid, of Woolwich Common, left a legacy of \u00a3400, in the Three per Cents., to the support of the inmates. Schools for the Poor. \u2014 Help also came in from an earlier source. In 1750, Mrs. Anne Withers had left \u00a3100 for the erection ofa school house (which was built on part of the old site) and \u00a31,100, invested in Old South-Sea Annuities, to the rector and churchwardens in trust for the maintenance of a schoolmistress for ever, in order to educate thirty poor girls. She also gave the interest of \u00a3400 Government securities to buy bread for the poor, to be given away weekly between 4th October and 27th December, every year. When the National Schools were erected, the teacher's endowment of \u00a31,100 was in due form transferred to them, being still employed for the purpose intended, but in a diverted channel. Its value in 1867 was \u00a31,202, and the income derived from it, \u00a336 ls. 2d. per annum. The schoolhouse in Rope yard Rails was, however, converted into a central almshouse, and its occupants are still elected by the rector and churchwardens, the tenants of the other cottages being chosen by the Local Board of Health, the subscribers, and others. The almshouse funds have since been increased by the care and assiduity of Mr. Morgan and his friends ; and a recent substantial legacy of \u00a32,000, under the will of Dr. Hallifax (formerly of Wool wich), who died at Brighton in October, 1885, has relieved the trustees of their monetary anxieties. Dr. Hallifax was a surgeon at Woolwich,"], [227, "PLATE XVIII. The Goldsmiths' Almshouses in 1835. Woolwich Workhouse, erected 1731, demolished 1842.

A Woolwich Character. \u2014 The following event in connection with Dr. Hallifax was published by a Brighton paper in 1877 : \u2014 A piece of good fortune has just fallen to the lot of Dr. Hallifax of Brighton. An aged miser, who died a few days since at Woolwich, has left him a legacy of \u00a36,000. The old gentleman, John Clark by name, was a rather singular character. He was eighty-six years of age, and, although he was reputed to be the possessor of a large fortune, he lived to the last in a squalid hovel in the poorest part of AA'oolwich,* where, being a man of education, he devoted himself to the accumulation and study of books, of which he leaves a large store. It is said that the front shutters of his house have not been opened for thirty years, and that he never took a regular meal. He did not know the taste of wine or spirits. The value of his estate has not yet been computed, but, from the fact that besides the legacy to Dr. Hallifax, he bequeathes \u00a35,000 to his housekeeper, and various legacies of smaller amount to the local chari ties and to a number of the poor neighbours by whom he was surrounded, it is estimated at between \u00a330,000 and \u00a340,000. Parish Gifts. \u2014 The other parochial charities are the following : \u2014 1575. Sir William Lambarde left one place in Queen Elizabeth's College at Greenwich to be filled from Woolwich for ever. 1621. Richard Sims and Anne his wife gave four small tenements to the poor. By vestry order, August, 1731, three small tenements, probably the same property, were pulled down and the ground let. Annual value, \u00a33. 1622. William Hawkes, formerly minister of Woolwich, devised to the rector and churchwardens, in trust, the rent of one acre of marsh land, situate in the Abbey Level, Plumstead Marshes, and the interest of \u00a327, to be expended in bread for the poor, one shilling's worth every Sunday. 1639. Philip Roberts, by will, dated 24th August, devised an annual rent charge of \u00a31 to be expended in bread for the poor. The sum issued originally out of three small houses in Woolwich, and the charge was confirmed by the Master of the Rolls, 20th April, 1694. The Crown and Masons' Arms public-house stands on the site of the three houses, and the \u00a31 is paid yearly by the owner. 1657. The Rev. Abraham Colfe, vicar of Lewisham, left 8s. 8d. a year for the poor, to be distributed in bread, and gave the rector and churchwardens of AAroolwich the right of presentation of three boys to the Free Grammar School endowed by him at Lewisham. 1744. General Joseph Smith, H.E.I.C.S., by will gave \u00a31,000 in trust to the rector and churchwardens for the benefit of the poor. This sum, with interest amount ing to \u00a31,785, was recovered by a suit in Chancery, and is now invested in Three per Cents. The income is laid out in bread for the poor. 1758. Mrs. Maiy Wiseman, by will dated 3rd January, left \u00a31,000 Old South Sea Annuities, for educating and clothing six orphan boys, sons of shipwrights. The stock increased to \u00a34,300 in 1868, and the income to \u00a3129, sufficient for ten boys.t * Hog Lane, otherwise Nile Street. t This bequest, however, has been unavoidably diverted from the purposes intended by the testator, for there are no shipwrights' boys left at Woolwich to teach or apparel, and other orphans have had to stand in the places of the young shipwright.. Such instances show how unwise are these special legacies. The late Mr. John Harris of Plumstead, who bequeathed a large fortune to charitable works, once confided to me I"], [230, "126 RECORDS OF THE WOOLAVICH DISTRICT. 1806.

An account was published in \" Hone's Everyday Book \" of November 24th, 1825, from a correspon dent (\" R. R.\"), describing an annual ceremony observed on the evening of St. Clement's Day by the blacksmiths' apprentices of the Dockyard at AVoolwich : \u2014 One of the senior apprentices being chosen to serve as Old Clem (so called by them) is attired in a greatcoat, having his head covered with an oakham wig, face masked, and a long white beard flowing therefrom. Thus attired, he seats himself in a large wooden chair, chiefly covered with a sort of stuff called bunting, with a crown and anchor, made of wood, on the top, and around it four transparencies, representing \" The Blacksmiths' Arms,\" \" Anchorsmiths at Work,\" \" Britannia with her Anchor,\" and \" Mount Etna.'' He has before him a wooden anvil, and in his hands a pair of tongs and wooden hammer, which, in general, he makes good use of whilst reciting his speech. A mate, also masked, attends him with a wooden sledge-hammer ; he is also surrounded by a number of other attendants, some of whom carry torches, banners, flags, &c. ; others battle-axes, tomahawks, and other accoutrements of war. This \u25a0procession, headed by a drum and fife, and six men with old Clem mounted on tlieir shoulders, proceeds round the town, stopping and refreshing at nearly every public house (which, by the by, are pretty numerous), not forgetting to call on the black smiths and officers of the Dockyard. There the money-box is pretty freely handed, after Old Clem and his mate have recited tlieir speeches, which commence by the mate calling for order, with \u2014 \" Gentlemen all, attention give, And wish St. Clem long long to live.\" Old Clem then recites the following speech : \u2014 \" I am the real St. Clement, the first founder of brass, iron, and steel, from the ore. I have been to Mount Etna, where the god Arulcan first built his forge, and forged the armour and thunderbolts for the god Jupiter. I have been through the deserts of Arabia ; through Asia, Africa, and America ; through the city of Pongrove ; through the town of Tipmingo ; and all the northern parts of Scotland. I arrived in London on the twenty-third of November, and came down to His Majesty's Dockyard at Wool wich to see how all the gentlemen came on there. I found them all hard at work. and wish to leave them well on the twenty-fourth.\" The mate then subjoins : \u2014 \" Come all you A'ulcans stout and strong, Unto St. Clem we do belong ; I know this house is well prepared With plenty of money and good strong beer, And we must drink before we part, All for to cheer each merry heart. his proposal to leave a sum of money to buy milk for the poor, and I persuaded him to give the money to some hospital instead. My suggestion that future inven- tion might supersede milk so affected the good and thoughtful old gentleman that he left me \u00a3100 in his will."], [231, "127 WOOLWICH.

St. Catherine. \u2014 The same correspondent speaks of another custom which has not been so well fostered as that of \" Old Clem,\" whom we saw paraded in a cart, drawn by a horse in place of the six lusty black smiths, only a few years since. He ought to have died with the Dock yard, but he has been kept alive for the sake of the revelry by volunteer successors of the old apprentices. Says the writer aforesaid, in 1825 : \u2014 On the 25th of November, St. Catherine's Day,* a man dressed in woman's clothes with a large wheel by his side, to represent St. Catherine, was brought out of the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich (by the workmen of that place) about six o'clock in the evening, seated in a large wooden chair, and carried by men round the town, with attendants, &c, similiar to St. Clement's. They stopped at different houses, where they used to recite a speech ; but this ceremony has been discontinued these last eight or nine years. \u2014 R. R. t * I cannot trace any association between the Dockyard and St. Catherine or her wheel, but there was once (about 150 years ago) a tavern named in her honour at Shooters' Hill. The probability is that the shipwrights, after enjoying the festival of St. Clement on Nov. 23rd took to observing St. Catherine's Day (Nov. 25th) as an excuse for renewing the fun. t R. R. was not Richard Ruegg, who in 1825 was but nine years old. i 2"], [232, "CHAPTER XII. STREETS AND PEOPLE. Woolwich Street Names. \u2014 Much of our local history may be read in the names of the streets. Powis Street, the most central and important thoroughfare of modern AAroolwic*h, commenced to exist only at the beginning of this century. It was laid out as part of the Bowater estate purchased by the Powises, a family of brewers at Greenwich, about 1800. The Powis family still hold the property. Thomas Street, William Street, Richard Street (which is now absorbed in Hare Street), and Charles Street were named after members of the Powis family. Eleanor Road and Monk Street have a similar origin, but are of later date (about 1860). Brewer Street commemorates the family trade. Rectory Place, and the streets to the north, were built on the Glebe or Rectory land about 1820. Rectory Grove occupies the garden of Grove House. St. Mary Street was on the Glebe, and is named after the church. Parson's Hill was the hill just opposite the old Parsonage by the river. Mulgrave Place was one of the first streets to appear when the town began to expand in 1810. It bears the name of Earl Mulgrave, the then Master-General of the Ordnance. AVellington Street marks the date of its formation, about 1815-20, when the hero of Waterloo was at the height of his glory. Green's End is the end of the green on which the Sappers drilled. Spray Street was laid out by a Mr. Spray, about 1800 (see Burrage Estate map, under \" Plumstead \"). Helen Street, on the same estate, was named after Miss Helen Pattison. Mill Lane, formerly Cholic Lane, [was the high road to London,* with a mill standing on the eastern side, in the place of the Royal Engineer Office, until about 1860. \" Rose Bank \" adjoined, and Barrack Court occupied the site of the Auxiliary and Female Hospitals about 1850. Cholic Lane bore its old name until 1830. New Road was made about 1790 to connect Plumstead Boad with Cholic Lane, the line of traffic having previously been carried round Green's End. * How the ancients came to make the high road from Woolwich to London by such a crooked route we shall probably find out as we proceed, but it may be at once stated that there are good reasons for supposing that the highway across AA'oolwich and Plumstead Commons pre-existed from a very early period, and that the traffic from the town was simply led into it at a right angle. The Lower Boad was no doubt of older date, and although it seems to have been badly maintained until recent times, its better level would naturally have attracted most of the vehicles."], [233, ""], [234, "To face page 129.] Map of Woolwich and Locality, 1778. PLATE XIX."], [235, "129 WOOLWICH. The White Gate was opposite Barrack Court. The road to this spot from the Barracks was laid out after 1810, when it was only a footpath. Nightingale Place was until 1850 known as \" Ditchwater Lane,\" from the brook which ran across it and under the hedges of Brookhill Park. Typographii EtihingCa.,sc. Map of Woolwich, and Locality, 1885. Nightingale Vale owes its name to the \" feathered choir,\" which made music in the valley. Sandy Hill was a footpath deep in sand until the Board of Commissioners made the road about 1848 upon a tough foundation of faggots. Waterman's Fields is a name which may have been taken from the landowner, but"], [236, "130 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. is more probably a corruption of \" water-fields,\" referring to the watercourse which ran from Brookhill to the river. The houses were built about 1770. Bull Fields may be traced to the tavern at the Arsenal Station. The Bull was one of the first houses built on the site of the old sandpit. Market Street, Upper, and Lower, and Little, remind us of the attempt made by the Board of Commissioners in 1808 to force a market on uncongenial soil. Its site is now occupied by the Town Hall and Police Offices. Union Street and Union Gardens are traceable to the old workhouse in Ropeyard Rails. The workhouse was for a time connected with the Greenwich Union, and a passage leading from the gardens was left when Beresford Street was built. But Union Street when completed had a dead end, which was removed with some diffi culty in after years. The Gardens, the name by which the locality is also known, has survived since the spot was cultivated by the cottagers about 1835. Beresford Square, though cleared many years previously of the old cottages which occupied the site, was named after the Marquis of Beresford, Master-General when the new entrance to the Royal Arsenal was formed in 1828-30. Beresford Street was built on the site of the Rope Walk soon afterwards. Ropeyard Rails have borne the name for nearly three hundred years, having occu pied the rear of the Rope Walk. Cannon Row was called \" Ragged Row,\" until the Government set up a number ot old guns for posts along the footpath. The parish took up the posts and sold them a generation or two later. Nelson Street, Collingwood Street, and Rodney Street were named in honour oi the admirals ofthe Nile, Copenhagen, and Trafalgar, 1805. Meeting House Lane led to a little chapel or meeting house which stood in an orchard by the river from 1740 until about 1837. Globe Lane was so called after a now extinct tavern. Cross Street West was made at the same time as New Road, about 1790. Cross Street East and its continuations came into being some years subsequently. Peak's Place is the degenerate tailpiece of primitive Love Lane. Taylor Street was built on land belonging to Mr. Taylor about 1810 (see Burrage Estate map), and was called Taylor's Buildings. The railway bisected it in 1848-9. New Street is a very old street. It was called New Street in 1740, when George II. was king. New Street, Kidd Street, was built about 1830. Nile Street was called Hog Lane until about 1860. It is probably the oldest street in Woolwich, and was occupied by shipwrights and other decent people in 1835. It was re-named Nile Street after a tavern at the river end. Hog Lane, Cock Yard, and Dog Yard, are said to have been appurtenances of the great house which stood in the Grove, between High Street and the river, and to mark the sites of the piggery, poultry farm, and kennel. There were also at one time Sow Alley, Pig Court, and Cow Yard adjacent. Hare Street is another of the zoological series. It was a short and narrow cui de sac until it met and united with Richard Street, about 1820. It was widened in 1883. Bell Watergate was named after the Bell, a very old tavern .* Glass Yard is a relic of the Huguenots, who are said to have established a glass factory here. Mortgramit Square had a strange conception. It was the joint property of Messrs. * It is asserted that it was at the Bell the captain of the Shannon formed the crew with which he fought the famous battle with the Chesapeake in the American war."], [237, ""], [238, "37.

It was proposed to be Knight Street, but the official who attends to such matters translated it into German. Milward Street was named after Colonel Milward, R.A., Superintendent of the Royal Laboratory, 1870. Ordnance Terrace at Shooters' Hill stands on part of the plantation acquired by the Board of Ordnance, 1809.

The hill remains, but the brook and the greensward beside the road disappeared about 1855. Love Lane was in the old time a footpath across fields. It became a cart road, and in the early part of this century it was hedged in, and was so narrow that the bushes brushed both sides of the carriages. Hill Street did not exist until 1806. The way to Charlton by the Little Heath was previously a mere track over the waste. Wood Street, AVoodville Street, Woodlands Terrace, &c, are all within the ancient boundaries of Hanging Wood. Maryon Road adjacent takes the penultimate name of the Wilson family. Hardin Street and Hardin's Manorway tell of Mr. Hardin, an extensive farmer, whose homestead is now represented by the large house at the Dockyard Gate, for many years occupied by the Commodore-Superintendent. Mr. Hardin's land was partly taken into the Dockyard, but the bulk of it fell to his relatives, the Shersbys, by whom it was laid out in streets prior to 1850. Harden's Lane, in High Street, was so-called as early at least as 1740. Bowater Crescent is on the site of the park which surrounded the mansion on \" Mount Pleasant,\" the home of the Bowaters and their predecessors. The Bowater Pond on the hill was an ornamental water in the pleasure grounds, but was converted into a reservoir by the Kent Water Company in 1812. Henry and Samuel Streets were named after the Bowaters. Rush Grove was an avenue leading past the great pond to Bowater House. Chapel Street traces its name to the Baptist Chapel near its foot. Ogilby Street is one of a series of roads on a part of the Bowater Park purchased and laid out by Mr. Ogilby about 1850. Artillery Place was naturally the outgrowth of the Barracks between 1775 and 1820. Arery few of the houses were built prior to 1810. Orchard Street will be seen by the old maps to occupy the place of an orchard. Station Road, North Kent Terrace, &c, were laid out when the North Kent Rail way came through in 1848-9. Sand Street leads through an old sandpit, the boundary of which is clearly seen at the upper part near Trafalgar Street. Prospect Row was a narrow path between hedges, and called \"Hedge Row\" all the way to Charlton. Bowling Green Row tells its origin, as do many more ; but the derivation of other names, such as Coleman Street, and Surgeon Street, being remote, can only be conjectured, i Angelsea Road, which was built about 1856, was named after the tavern at the corner, which took its title from the famous Marquis, who was Master-General of the Ordnance when it was established in 1846. As the Marquis of Anglesea was in some sense a local celebrity, I may quote a humorous ' ' Epitaph \" written by George Canning on the leg which the hero left buried on the field of AVaterloo. EPITAPH ON THE MARQUIS OF ANGLESEA'S LEG. Here rests \u2014 and let no saucy knave Presume to sneer and laugh, A leg and foot, to speak more plain, Rest here, of one commanding, To learn that mouldering in the grave Is laid \u2014 a British calf. Who, though his wits he might retain, Lost half his understanding ; And here five little ones repose, Twin-born with other five, And when the guns, with thunder fraught Poured bullets thick as hail, Unheeded by their brother toes, AA'ho now are all alive. Could only in this way be taught To give the foe leg-bail;"], [241, "133 WOOLWICH. And now in England, just as gay As in the battle brave, For Fortune's pardon I must beg \u2014 She meant not to disarm ; Goes to the rout , review, or play, With one foot in the grave. And when she lopped the hero's leg She did not seek his h-arm, Fortune in vain here showed her spite ; For he will still be found, And but indulged a harmless whim Since he could walk with one, Should England's sons engage in fight, Resolved to stand his ground. She saw two legs were lost on him Who never meant to run. Population. \u2014 It is a remarkable and unquestionable fact that the people of Woolwich have gradually and continually increased in number from the earliest time of which we have any data. Before the census came into vogue in 1801, there are no positive records of the popu lation, but we may gather from the registers some approximate ideas on the subject, The rapid growth indicated as these figures approach the end of the last century can hardly fail to be noticed. The same, or proportionate, increase will be found to have taken place at the same period in Plumstead and Charlton, the circumstance being due to an aug mentation of workmen in the Government establishments during the great wars. The number of houses in Woolwich in 1795 was 1,200 ; in 1801, 1,362 ; and in 1810, 1,800.

Water and Dry Land. \u2014 The proportion of land and water is as follows in acres : \u2014 in acres : \u2014 These totals do not correspond with the average usually given, which merely reckons land and still water. Woolwich is in area a small parish, comprising without the river only 1,126 acres, of which 336 are north ofthe Thames and 790 on the south. Of this space the Government occupies 360 acres, or nearly one-third. The river frontage (north and south) measures 2,696 yards, of which the Royal Arsenal and Dockyard absorb about 1,600 yards. Increasing and Multiplying. \u2014 There were in the \"Woolwich Union district, during the ten years 1871-80, 7,228 marriages, 27,559 births, and 15,569 deaths, being an excess of births over deaths of 11,990. The population during the same period increased by 7,465. But, notwithstanding this great number of births, it is certain that the gradual and increasing growth of the population both of Woolwich and its neighbouring parishes has been due largely to immigration, and every increase recorded marks the degree of importance added to the place since the preceding enumeration. Making allowance for the multiplication of inhabitants by birth, there would, under ordinary circumstances, have prevailed the various causes which drain populations and keep the numbers from excessive augmentation ; and it is quite clear, from external actual evidences, that the additions have, at all the times covered by the foregoing figures, been ascribable in a large degree to the influx of strangers. Whence have they come ? We read frequently in the annals of the early Dockyard of shipwrights and others being brought here from distant places, some being foreigners and even prisoners of war ; and when Woolwich became a garrison, the men who settled here from all quarters and reared new families of Woolwich children must have been very many. We have seen much of this in our own time, but it was a cause which operated still more in the olden days, when the conditions of life in the army were so different from those of the present.

Chosen People. \u2014 Even the precise spots from which these men, some of whom are our most respected citizens, have sprung would not be difficult to hit upon. Patronage existed a generation or two back to an extent of which we have hardly a conception, and, as a general rule, the smaller the borough the greater was the influence of its parlia mentary representative. In the books of the Ordnance Department, at the Arsenal, it was actually the custom to enroll against every man's name the name of his patron, and it was long proverbial that the two members who sat in the House of Commons for the diminutive town of Queenborough (now disfranchised) had provided places under Govern ment for tho sons of the whole constituency. North Britons. \u2014 The natural enterprise and instinct of the northern races on both sides of the Tweed led very many of them in search of fortune to turn their footsteps hither in the early part of the century, and there is much to be traced to the Scotch character in the sober and diligent habits of the people of Woolwich and Plumstead. The Huguenots. \u2014 A small but interesting importation of French and Flemish blood is ascribed to the Huguenots. When the persecuted Protestants fled from France and Holland in 1554, they nearly all landed at Rye and Sandwich, and spread themselves over Kent and the adjacent counties. They are believed to have established a glass manufactory at Woolwich, in the part of High Street still known as Glass Yard, and the parish registers display several of their names, and a few with the occupation of \" glass-maker \" appended. The following familiar names are found in the roll of the Huguenot families : Delafield, De Grot, Champion, Kettel, Gerard, Maynard, Raymond, Fleury, Austin, Chamberlayne, Majendie, Vincent, Pain, Martin, and many more. Some of the foreigners transformed their names thus \u2014 L'Oiseau to Bird, Le Jeune to Young, Du Bois to Wood, La Croix to Ring, Le Maitre to Masters, Dulau to Waters, Sauvage to Savage or Wild, Touncher to Cooper, and so on ; while others suffered simple cor ruption, Drouet becoming Drewett ; Barre, Barr ; Bouchier, Butcher or Boxer ; Mahieu, Mayhew ; Huyghens, Huggens or Higgins; Kerk, Kirk ; Breton, Britton ; De Moulins, Mullins ; Langlois, Langley ; Petit, Pettit ; Reveil, Revill, &c* A curious instance of colonisation is afforded by the case of M. Chas teauneuf, a French midshipman, who was sent to Woolwich as prisoner * The Rev. J. Jordan has traced out the following Huguenot names in the parish registers : \u2014 Tittery, Henzy, Filmer (glassmaker) and Hasselton (glassmaker) between 1670 and 1682."], [248, "140 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. on board a prize taken in the war with Buonaparte. He liked Woolwich so well that he settled on shore, married, died, and left a numerous progeny of Woolwich worthies. Railway Men. \u2014 More recently there has been a healthy introduction of railwaymen \u2014 guards and engine-drivers, and such honest folk \u2014 at Plumstead. This class is one of the best specimens of the British artisan, and the future people of Plumstead will be all the better for the mixture of so excellent an ingredient. Siemens' Telegraph Works. \u2014 So much ofthe space, and so much of the local labour, have been absorbed by the Government works that there has been little left for private enterprise. But a piece of good fortune fell to the share of Woolwich and its neighbours when the high class industry known to all the world as Siemens Brothers' Telegraph Works came to be established just on the Charlton boundary. This was in 1860, not long after the shipbuilders and anchorsmiths were driven from the Dockyard, and the employment which the twin sciences of telegraphy and electricity have ever since afforded has been of the utmost service in providing as residents of the district a superior order of mechanics and an advanced rank of scientific men. In 1857 the firm commenced its English enterprise (as a branch of the Berlin house ) at Millbank, where a workshop was taken at the corner of Holywell Street, merely for the repairs of telegraph instruments, under the name of Siemens, Halske & Co. Increase of business necessitated larger premises, and the extortionate charges of the then existing \" Cable-ring \" compelled Messrs. Siemens to set up machinery for themselves in opposition to the clique. In 1860 they put their feet down on the spot where their great factory has since grown up, starting with a small building next the Warspitc bathing-place, at the river corner of Hardin's Manorway. The buildings now cover six and a half acres. The old firm at Berlin has always retained its association with the English business, but on the retirement of Mr. Halske, this branch became known as \" Siemens Brothel's,\" the brothers being Werner, Carl, and William. Still later, in consequence of Mr. Ludwig Loeffler, the manager, entering into partnership, the title of the firm was changed to that which it now bears, \"Siemens Brothers & Co., Limited.\" Sir William Siemens. \u2014 Sir William Siemens, the most distin guished of the four brothers (Werner, Wilhelm, Carl, and Friedrich), was born in Hanover, April 4th, 1823, and came to England in 1842 (then a mere student), to introduce a method of gilding by galvanic deposit invented by his brother, Dr. Werner Siemens. After returning for a time to Germany he decided in 1844 upon remaining in England, and in 1850 he became a naturalized subject of the Queen. To describe"], [249, "141 WOOLWICH. all that he and his colleagues have done for the practical application of electricity would require the full dimensions of thi3 volume, but the several Atlantic cables and the electric light will ever be asso ciated with the name of the Woolwich enterprise. That remarkable ship tho Faraday was built from Sir Wm. Sie mens' designs, and has greatly assisted in the development of submarine telegraphy. He was knighted by Her Majesty on the 21st of April, 1883, and died on the 18th of November in the same year, aged sixty years. A German Colony. \u2014 Thus Sir W. Siemens. was introduced to Woolwich and her neighbours, not only a new industry for the employment of the inhabitants, but a number of most intelligent German colonists to swell the population and help the prosperity of the ever-growing townships. Woolwich Postal District. \u2014 The changes which have come over Woolwich and the neighbourhood during the last forty years is well illustrated by the postal service. In 1850 there were but eight post men employed in the delivery of letters at Woolwich, Plumstead, Shooters' Hill, and New Charlton, where now (1888) fifty-four men are required for the work. There were then only three places at Woolwich and one at, Plumstead where letters could be posted ; there are now in Woolwich twenty-five and in Plumstead eighteen. In 1850 the conveyance of country letters was so uncertain that the time of first delivery was frequently 12.30 and 1 p.m., whereas we get our country post at the present time between 8 and 9 a.m. Mr. George John Lockwood was appointed postmaster at Woolwich in 1874, at which time the locality was for a short period in the London S.E. district ; but in April, 1875, it was formed into a separate division and known as the Woolwich Postal District. The Great Exhibition of 1851.\u2014 On June 8th, 1850, a meeting, which was probably the largest ever held within a building at Woolwich, took place in the Royal Artillery Riding School in support ofthe Great Exhibition ofthe Works of Industry ofall Nations, 1851. Galleries were erected by Mr. G. H. Graham and Mr. J. Tricket, and two thousand persons were seated. General Sir Thomas Downman presided, and K"], [250, "142 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. addresses were delivered by Commodore Eden, R.N., Colonel Reid, R.E., the Rev. A. De La Mare, the Rev. Dr. Carlisle, Messrs. R. Ruegg, D. W. Wire, F. Bossey, and others. Mr. T. R. Richardson spoke for the Dockyard workmen, and Mr. (afterwards Sir) J. Anderson for the Royal Arsenal. It was a very loyal, hearty, and enthusiastic meeting. Banking. \u2014 It is neither to be expected nor desired that we should essay to trace the source of all the trade and enterprise which the growth and prosperity of Woolwich have attracted to it, but it may be noted with satisfaction how large a proportion of its commercial men are native-born and members of its old-established families. An excep tion may be made in the case of the banking interest, which is to some extent national rather than local. Woolwich Banks. \u2014 The earliest \"Woolwich bank\" of which we have any notice was a private concern known first as \"Nokes and Ward \" and then as \" Budgen, Ward, and Co.,\" and was held at the house in Rectory Place now occupied by Mr. T. H. Jones, and known as Glebe House. Mr. Budgen resided at the Manor House next Plumstead Church, and was churchwarden of Plumstead. The bank stopped pay ment in November, 1836, and the failure caused great excitement and distress, as the townspeople had reposed absolute confidence in its security. The loss amounted to \u00a37,000, the available assets, which were also \u00a37,000, being barely half sufficient to meet the liabilities. London and County. \u2014 Thereupon the \"Surrey, Kent, and Sussex Bank\" came to the help of the town, and soon afterwards changed its title to that of the \"London and County Bank,\" under which it has well served the population for more than fifty years. At first its estab lishment was on the north-east corner of William Street, where is now a chemist's shop, but it moved across the road about 1850 to an old pawn shop (formerly occupied by Mr. Lewis Davis), and on that site the pre sent substantial building was erected in 1867. The local managers within my recollection have been Mr. Grugeon, Mr. Gates, and the pre sent head, Mr. R. Rabson. London and Provincial. \u2014 In the year 1873, as the population grew, a second banking establishment was started in Beresford Square, by the Metropolitan and Provincial Bank (afterwards Metropolitan only), Mr. J. T. Drake having the management. This effort gave place in 1873 to the London and Provincial Bank, which, with Mr. Drake as its manager, opened a branch at 38, Green's End, from whence it was removed to the corner of Wellington Street and Thomas Street in 1879. Mr. Drake retired in 1887, and was succeeded by Mr. W. H. Lewis. Capital and Counties.\u2014 The Capital and Counties Bank opened a"], [251, "143 WOOLWICH. branch at Woolwich on August 1st 1876*, occupying the premises in Beresford Square formerly held by the Metropolitan, and having for its manager Mr. W. Bryan. In 1875 the same premises were temporarily occupied by a fraudulent \u2022concern called \" The Co-operative Bank,\" which promised 18 per cent. on deposits, and collapsed in January, 1876. The Savings Bank. \u2014 A good record must be given to the old Woolwich and Plumstead Savings Bank, which helped the humble fru gality of the poorer inhabitants for more than half a century \u2014 from 1816 until 186S \u2014 -when, on May 16, it was honourably dissolved, the establishment of Post Office Savings Banks having* removed the motive of its existence. It was located at the western end of Powis Street, and its offices are now in possession of the Odd-Fellows of the Woolwich District. Breach of Trust. \u2014 Not uneventful, however, was the life of the Woolwich and Plumstead Savings Bank, for it experienced a severe blow in 1834 by the defalcations of its secretary. Circumstances having led me to investigate this matter, I give the following report : \u2014 Nov. 1st, 1834. \u2014 During the last fortnight the directors and trustees ot the Woolwich and Plumstead Savings Bank have heen engaged in examining the hook3 of that institution, in consequence of the discovery of a fraud on the part of the actuary, Mr. William Gloag, a person of very respectahle connections, who was appointed to that situation through the interest of Sir John Wehh, Director-General \u25a0of the Medical Department at Woolwich ; and it is stated that an embezzlement of its funds has been carried on to a very considerable extent, though there is every reason to believe that the depositors will not be eventually the losers. Much consternation has prevailed, however, among that class of persons ; and for the purpose as far as possible of relieving their fears, a public examination yesterday took place of Mr. Gloag before the magistrates at Woolwich, before whom he has undergone three several private examinations. About twelve o'clock, Adam Young, Esq., chairman, sat at the bench, assisted by Mr. John Wray. The Rev. Dr. Watson and Mr. W. Stacey were also present. Long before the opening of the court the seat behind the bench was occupied by several of the most respectable inhabitants of the neighbourhood, while the part in front ofthe magistrates devoted to the public was crowded to excess. Near one o'clock the prisoner, dressed in a suit of black, was placed at the bar. The charge against the prisoner was for embezzling \u00a3243 6s. 4id., moneys said to have been lodged in the bank on account of Sarah Jones. As the depositions of the witnesses were taken at the private examination of the prisoner they were read by Mr. Smith, jun., and the witnesses were respectively sworn. The statement ot several witnesses who had examined the books belonging to the bank were then gone through at some length, from which it appeared that the sum of _\u00a3243 13s. 2\u00a3d. with interest had been paid out to a depositor named Sarah Jones ; but it turned out that no such payment had been made. It appeared that the prisoner * Preceded for a short period by the Hampshire Bank, which followed hither the 5th (Northumberland) Fusiliers. K 2"], [252, "144 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. had acknowledged his guilt, and that he had been embezzling the money of the bank for a long time. The chairman then observed that the period had arrived when it became his duty to give the result of the investigation. All the depositions had been read, anil from them he was quite satisfied that there w*as sufficient evidence (in which view his brother magistrates concurred) to send him to Maidstone, there to take his trial on the charges brought against him. The witnesses were bound over, in subscribing to which obligation Sir John Webb was conspicuously affected. Sir John Webb addressed the persons in the court, stating that seven gentlemen, directors of the bank, had been engaged several days in examining the books, and that as soon as the accounts are looked into a public meeting would be called ol all the depositors, when a statement of the accounts would be laid before them. Much delay had been caused from the depositors not having brought in their books. He had no doubt that a satisfactory statement would be made. The prisoner was then removed from the bar, in custody of Campion the officer. Campion was called back, and in answer to questions from Sir John Webb, he said that since he had had the prisoner in his custody he had placed him in the cage. He was always with him, and no magistrate, either directly or indirectly, had had communication with him. The chairman then directed Campion to take the prisoner instantly to Maidstone, as in consequence of the new criminal court law coming into operation this day some demur might arise. The prisoner was immediately conveyed to Maidstone, where he was tried at the following county assizes, and sentenced to transportation for life. A part of the convict's sentence was served on board the hulks at Woolwich. Strange Panic. \u2014 The trustees had another alarm in the later days of the bank, arising from a curious panic, which had no other founda tion than a stupid rumour. The story went from mouth to mouth that \" the Bank \" was \" closed.\" It was speedily traced to the circumstance ofa beer-house known as \" The Bank\" in High Street (now \"The Coat and Badge \") having put up its shutters, but it created a smart run upon the Savings Bank and upon the other banking establishments likewise. Another \"Respectahle\" Pelon. \u2014 In the same year that Gloag was tried, AVoolwich had an earlier sensation. On March 15th, 1834, Thomas Gorhani, solicitor, aged thirty-six, was tried at Maid- stone for forging a bill of exchange with intent to defraud Mr. George Hudson of \u00a350. Mr. Hudson said he was a solicitor at Woolwich. Prisoner owed him \u00a328 and paid him with the bill produced, which purported to be drawn by Mr. Shrubsole, grocer, Sheerness. He cashed it at the bank of Messrs. Nokes and Ward, Woolwich. Mr. Nokes, solicitor and banker, said the prisoner had served his articles with him. The bill was in the prisoner's handwriting. The prisoner, who feigned insanity, and asked for \" Mary,\" was sentenced to transportation for life. There were three or four other indictments against the prisoner, which in consequence of this conviction were not brought on."], [253, ""], [254, "View of Woolwich in 1698, showing the ancient Church, the Dockyard, and Dock-rails.

It may, indeed, be asserted that throughout our land the village church is honoured with the best position in the village ; and so much of the lives and interests of our ancestors were centred there that, generally speaking, the history of the parish church may be regarded as the history of the parish. This is true in a large measure of Woolwich, especially in the primitive period which preceded the birth of the Dockyard ; and yet there is so much of our local annals associated distinctly and inseparately with the church and churchyard that I have felt bound to divide their records from the rest, and to devote to this particular theme its own particular chapters. A Thousand Years. \u2014 It is almost beyond doubt that this spot has been the site of a church for at least a thousand years. The present"], [256, "146 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. structure was built only in 1735, but it replaced a former one which was said to have been very ancient. Three representations of the earlier church are known to exist, and I have copies of all three in this work. The first in order of date is the drawing made in 1662 by Jonas Moore, and appears on Plate VII. ; the second is that which is given here, is thirty-six years later, and on a clearer scale ; and the third is the excellent view of 1739, which appears on Plate IV., and shows the old edifice and it successor standing on the hill together. The site of the older sanctuary was on the north side of the Church Hill footpath. The tombs of Henry Maudslay and Timothy Church now occupy part of the precise spot. At what period this former church was built no one can say, but the church chronicles go back to a.d. 400, and it is possible that it may have stood there from the first introduction of Christianity to this corner of Kent. Its appearance betokens a primitive construction, and other similar churches are still in existence which trace their origin to the early Saxons, and even to the Romans. There is no mention of its ever having been rebuilt prior to 1735, and no trace has ever been dis covered of a previous building, but it may nevertheless have heen several times erected on the same site. At the Conquest. \u2014 Distinct references to the church are found as far back as the Xormans, for it is declared to have been given by William the Conqueror's son, Henry I., to the Priory and monks of Rochester about the year 1100, with all the tithes belonging to it, for the good of the souls of his parents, himself, and his wife. Bishop Gundulph, who was at that time head of the see of Rochester, in separating his own maintenance from that of the monks, gave them Woolwich for their support, and granted them the free disposal of the vicarage. Except for a short interval* the parish has remained in the diocese of Rochester ever since. About 1190, however, Bishop Gilbert de Glanville, who succeeded Gundulph, held that the see had been im poverished by extravagance, and divested the monks of the church and tithes, but allowed them to receive a yearly donation of seven shillings out of the profits which had always been paid by the parishioners to their mother church. This seven shillings a year has been paid ever since to the Dean and Chapter of Rochester, and is paid still. The Ancient Fabric. \u2014 It is not difficult to credit the church with an existence of one thousand years when we have a list of the rectors, obtained from the archives of the diocese, which goes back with some interruption more than seven hundred years. One of them, William Prene, is said to have founded a chapel in connection with the * The parish of St. Mary Magdalen, Woolwich, was transferred to the London diocese August 20th, 1845, but prospectively restored to the diocese of Rochester by 26 and 27 Vic., c. 36 (1863-4)."], [257, "147 WOOLWICH. church (probably tbe second aisle) and given the belfry to it. He was buried in the old church in 1464. The most ancient monument of which we have any notice is that of one John Colin and wife, men tioned by Weever as having died in 1397. But the memorial had disappeared before Harris wrote in 1719, and the old church itself went twenty years later.* Edward VI. 's Schedule. \u2014 We have, moreover, some testimony as to the church bells in an inventory of Woolwich Church taken in the reign of Edward VI. and dated 1552, which is still in existence. This is signed by Richard Billyng, curate ; Robert Parker and William Clarke, churchwardens ; and states that the church property consisted of \"two chalaces of silver weying 8 oz., one Bible with Parapbrasis of Erasmus, one newe booke of the newe ordre of service, and one candlestick of latten, t three bells of bell mettell suted hanging in the steple there, and one little saint's bell of brass hanging in the said steple.\" There is a memorandum attached to explain that one other chalice mentioned in a previous inventory \" remaineth in possession of Robert Cokks, bere brewer,\" and \"one little crown of silver in the pos session of Nicholas Boughton, Esq.,+ executor unto Sir Edward Bough ton, knight.\" It is also noted that \" one pix\u00a7 of silver, three latten candle-sticks,\" and some vestments are to be sold for the \"reparations of the church,\" and that some other things bad been stolen. The Church Bells. \u2014 To finish with the bells, I ought to say here that I have inherited from the late Mr. B. Wells his belief that the present church had originally either four or six bells, and that they were in earlier times the occupants of tbe older belfry. About 1810 a London founder gave the present eight bells in exchange for the old ones, and Mr. Wells says that his father was present at the inaugural ringing and subsequent supper. The Titular Saint, \u2014 The parish was formerly dedicated to St. Lawrence, but this was altered four hundred and fifty years ago. The motive for the change was an agricultural one, showing the extent to which the farming interest prevailed in the early days. It had been customary to hold the feast of the Dedication on August 9th, the eve of * Weever's record dates from 1631, and is as follows : \u2014 \"Woolwich \u2014 Orate pro amina Johannis Colin et Mathilde vxoris eius : qui Johannis obiit 27 Januar .... and Mathilda 25 Octob. 1397. \"Hie iacet Dominus Will.

St. Lawrence, but in seasons of bad harvest this frequently happened to be a day of fasting and abstinence. So inconsistent an interruption of a joyful celebration was annoying to the good yeomen of Woolwich, and they petitioned their bishop to find them a more convenient saint. Accordingly, on the 1st of September, 1429, the Bishop of Rochester made a decree by which he transferred the festival to the 5th of October, which does not appear to be any saint's day in particular, and at some later time, probably when the church was rebuilt, the day was again changed to July the 22nd, which is the feast of St. Mary Magdalen, and remains the accepted anniversary in our day and generation. St. Margaret's, Woolwich. \u2014 Mention in an old diary (1610) of \" the bell-ringers at St. Margaret's, Woolwich,\"* has led me to make some inquiries, but I can find no other evidence that the church has ever borne any name beyond those authoritatively assigned to it, St. Lawrence and St. Mary. The festival of St. Margaret in the Church calendar is on July 20th, two days prior to the feast of St. Mary Magdalen. The diarist probably made a mistake. At the Dissolution. \u2014 The tribute of seven shillings a year just mentioned was seized by Henry VIII., with the rest of the revenues of St. Andrew's, Rochester, at the Dissolution, but the King in 1541 settled the income upon his new Dean and Chapter of Rochester. In 1288 the value of the church was assessed at ten marcs, but in Henry VIII.'s inventory it is put down at \u00a37 12s. 5d., with 15s. 3d. added for the \" yearly tenth.\" In 1650 the church living was described as \" a parsonage with a house and some glebe lands, worth \u00a355 per annum,\" Master William Hawkes being the rector. The ancient church, as will be seen from the illustrations, consisted of two aisles only, and had a square tower. The tower, according to Queen Elizabeth's view of the Thames, 1588, was at that time surmounted by a spire, but this may have been a mere fiction of the draughtsman, inserted for the purpose of indicating more clearly the character of the building. In the earliest reliable view of Woolwich, that of Jonas Moore, 1662, (Plate VII.) there is no spire. A Decrepit Old Age. \u2014Soon after 1700 the inhabitants appear to have grown anxious about their church, which was very much decayed, and in great peril, consequent on the shifting soil of the sand hill upon which it stood. As the hill had been worked for ballast on the river face hundreds of years before, t the danger from this source * See Dockyard, Pett's Diary, Feb. 1st, 1610. t A letter of licence written in Norman French and dated 1413 gives to certain \"dear and well-beloved \" persons, described as common labourers in boats called \"lyghters,\" bringing victuals to the City, full power to dig and take sand and gravel for ballast from both sides of the Thames without making payment to anyone for the same, so always that they do no damage to the \"walks \" or embankments of the river."], [259, "149 WOOLWICH. must have been constant and imminent from generation to generation, but the edifice had the advantage of being soundly constructed. It was, as we see, strongly buttressed, and, although its materials were but flints and chalk, it had stood from unrecorded time, a monument of credit to the early builders. Spenser's lines aptly describe the old church : \u2014 It was a goodly heap for to behold And spake the praises of the workman's wit, And full great pity that so fair a mould Did on so weak foundation ever sit ; For on a sandy hill, that still did flit And fall away, it mounted was on high That every breath of Heaven shaketh it. An Interesting Petition. \u2014 Furthermore, the church was too small for the increasing population, and the very limited graveyard must even then have been fully occupied. The following document, printed on a sheet apparently for circulation and dated 1718, is preserved among the unique curiosities in the inner sanctuary of the British Museum. Woolwich Church is situated on the top of a sandy hill, almost perpendicular, forty-three feet high from the cartroad of the highway, and but thirty-two feet south from the edge of the said hill. The fence of the church is on the edge of the said hill and is mostly undermined ; above sixty loads of the surface of the earth having slid and been washed down the hill within these three months last past, and several bones of dead bodies have been seen sliding down with the sand into the common cartroad, which increases the danger of its foundation and very much lessens the burial place. The inhabitants have it as a tradition that the said church is near one thousand three hundred years old, the foundation of which is rotten and mouldering ; the wood work, especially its roof, is so rotten that it cannot be repaired ; some part whereof about eight years since sunk and gave such a crack when it was full of the inhabitants, which put them into a very great consternation, insomuch that many were trampled under foot and hurt in crowding to get out of the church. There is near one thousand families belonging to the Navy Dockyard and Ropeyard, two hundred families belonging to the Ordnance service, and about one hundred independent of either, which, after the rate of five to each family, is six thousand five hundred, and the said old church cannot at most contain above six hundred people. All which reasons prove the necessity of building a new church and moving the situation of it farther south, as well as the present churchyard being small and already very full, and the parish very populous and daily increasing, there is not room for burying the dead. To which may be added that the poor's rates has been for several years past 3s. in the pound, never less than 2s. 3d., a heavy tax for poor labouring- men to pay, which makes them wholly unable to contribute more than they have done towards rebuilding the said church. The estimate of the charge for the rebuilding the said church, being proposed to be done with the utmost frugality, amounted to (before the inhabitants increased to the present number) upwards of the sum of \u00a35,069 0 0 From whence abating what has been collected by virtue of the brief the sum of 1,141 3 11 The sum wanted to rebuild the church according to the above-said estimate is upwards of 3,927 16 1"], [260, "150 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Collecting Funds. \u2014 The inhabitants bad, before the death of Queen Anne (which took place in 1714), obtained letters patent for collecting this needful sum of \u00a35,069, and Dr. Lindsay, the former rector, at that time Lord Primate of Ireland, with other friends of the church, gave \u00a3380 14s. 8d. towards it. Seven years prior to the rebuilding (i.e. 1726), a piece of ground measuring one and a half acres was obtained for enlarging the churchyard, and upon this the site of the new church was fixed. Previously the whole enclosure, church and churchyard, were on the north of the footpath which passes from High Street to Church Street. The added ground was purchased from Richard and John Bowater, bricks were made and a foundation laid down, and upon these preliminaries a sum of \u00a3746 17s. 8d. was expended. A Windfall. \u2014 The balance left had slightly improved by invest ment in the public funds, but in 1731 the whole sum available was \u00a31,230 in joint stock of South Sea annuities, an amount so far short of requirements that the promoters of the pious work became sorely troubled in their minds, when, to their great relief, an Act of Parlia ment was passed in 1732 for rebuilding Woolwich Church as one of fifty ordered to be built by the previous statute of Anne, cap. 2, and assigning \u00a33,000 towards the cost from certain funds and revenues set apart for the purpose. Another Check. \u2014 With good heart the parishioners then went to work, and built the body and tower and roofed all in, when they found themselves again involved, for they had spent all their money, and required \u00a31,000 to finish the undertaking. Another Windfall. \u2014 Some years elapsed without anything being done, but a vestry meeting was held on Sunday, the 25th of February, 1738, and the will of a good friend, Daniel Wiseman, Esq., was dis cussed. He was a dockyard official, and had held a good position at Deptford, but he had an affectionate remembrance of his earlier service at Woolwich, and not only ordained that at his death his body should be buried in the churchyard here, but devised a plan by which, without wronging his rightful kindred, he might help the completion of the church. Falling in with his scheme, the vestry at once resolved to petition Parliament for an act to give it virtue, and accordingly a measure was passed in 1739 for \" applying a sum of money given by the will of Daniel Wiseman, Esq., deceased, for finishing tbe church at Woolwich, and by raising an annuity chargeable on the parish rates.\" The pre amble to this act sets forth : \u2014 Whereas the sum of three thousand pounds granted out the coal dues by the pre-"], [261, "WOOLWICH. 151 vious act and the mone}* raised by collections has been expended and a substantial church built and covered in, but no further progress made towards the finishing of it for divine service, and whereas Daniel Wiseman, one of the trustees, made his last will bearing date the 26th of November, 1736, and directed that in case at the time of his decease the parish church lately built at Woolwich should not be completely finished and fit for divine service, then his wife, Mary Wiseman, whom he made sole executrix of his will, should pay or advance to the minister, churchwardens, and principal inhabitants of the parish of AVoolwich, such sum or sums of money out of the residue of his personal estate as should, by able, good, and honest workmen, be found wanting and necessary for completing the works of the said new church, not exceeding in the whole the sum of one thousand pounds, on conditions that the said one thousand pounds be paid only after the decease of his wife, Mary Wiseman, and her mother, Elizabeth Crouch, and not before, unless the rector or minister, church wardens, overseers of the poor, and other principal inhabitants of Woolwich would sign their bond, to pay interest at five per cent, until their deaths ; and whereas an estimate has been made ofthe expenses that will attend the finishing the said church, amount ing to \u00a3938 17s.. 5d., and whereas the parishioners of the parish of Woolwich, who are very poor, and chiefly consist of artificers and labourers employed in His Majesty's dock and yards, are unable to raise the money, and so long as the same remains unfinished will be destitute of a place of public divine worship ; and whereas the said Mary Wiseman and Elizabeth Crouch are willing that the said sum of one thousand pounds should be immediately applied, pursuant and according to the pious intention of the donor, so as an annuity equivalent to the interest may be effectually secured to them ; be it therefore enacted, &c.

In the London Gazette of October 25, 1853, an order appeared that : \u2014 On and after Monday, October 31st, 1853, with the exception of private vaults and graves, no more than one body should be buried in any grave in the churchyard of St. Mary, Woolwich, and that burials be wholly discontinued after the 1st of May, 1855. That, with the like exceptions and conditions, burials should cease in Union Chapel burial-ground on the 1st of May, 1854 ; that no more than one body in a grave should be permitted at the Wesleyan Methodist ground, and no burial within six feet of the school ; that burials be wholly discontinued in Salem Chapel burial ground, in Enon Chapel burial-ground, and under Queen Street Chapel. Burials under the chapel floor were at one time common, and some scandal was created in 1883 when, in converting Bethlehem Chapel into the chess club, several coffins were uncovered. The order just mentioned was afterwards postponed until October 23, 1855, and was made final September 29, 1857. The Cemetery. \u2014 On the 17th of January, 1855, the parishioners resolved by a majority taken at a poll to establish a cemetery, of which hereafter. Memorials. \u2014 There is more to be said before we quit this interest ing spot. The inner walls of the church support a number of memorial tablets. Over the chancel there are the following : \u2014 The Rev. Hugh Fraser, thirty-two years rector, who died on the 4th of April, 1837, in his seventy-third year ; the Rev. William Greenlaw, died 22nd December, 1850, in his seventieth year ; Major James Pattison Adye, died 1831 ; and Major-General Stephen Galway Adye, died 1836. A memorial to Mr. Greenlaw's two sons, who were both deprived of life by similar accidents in 1841 and 1845, is near the chancel. The story of the terrible fever on board H.M.S. Eclair in 1845 is perpetuated in a marble tablet erected by the survivors ; and amongst other inscriptions we read of John Mends, Esq., many years resident in this town, who died in 1821, and his son Tucker Mends, who fell at Algiers when eighteen years of age ; of Major-General Sir John Bo3cawen Savage, colonel-commandant Royal Marines, and \" Dame \" Sophia his wife, both of whom died in 1843 ; of Lieutenant-Colonel Belford, R.A., died 1841 ; Lieutenant-Colonel H. G. Jackson, R.A., died 1849 ; Lieutenant-Colonel Ford, R.M., died 1848 ; and Lieutenant-Colonel Middleton, 42nd Highlanders, who died here in 1843. Mr. Daniel Wiseman, who had served in Woolwich Dockyard, and been raised to the office of clerk of the cheque at Deptford, has a handsome memorial at the east end of the south gallery, befitting so good a benefactor of the church ; and opposite to it is the record of the Barnards, showing that Joel Barnard, attorney, was for many years vestry clerk of both Woolwich and Plumstead, and died in 1758 ; that John, his son, was \" thirty years clerk in the master intendant's office at Woolwich Yard ;\" and that Ann Barnard, Joel's daughter, who died in 1765, at the age of thirty-four, was \"a dutitul and affectionate child and sister, pleasing in person and manners, and very ingenious in the useful accomplishments of her sex.\""], [270, "156 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Graves and Tombs. \u2014 Scattered about the churchyard, but chiefly located on the southern side, the names of many distinguished officers are to be found on the tombs and gravestones, among them being those of \u2014 Colonel Colquhoun, Inspector Royal Carriage Department, died 1853 ; Brigade- Major Adye, died 1S09 ; General Adye, died 1838 ; and many more. There is a stone to the memory of Sergeant James Knight, R.A., who died in 1818, age seventy six, erected by General Sir Thomas Downman, Commandant of Woolwich Garrison, General Sir Hew D. Ross, D.A.G., and the officers of the Royal Artillery, in honour of \" a faithful old soldier who was first clerk in the Commandant's office for the long period of fifty years.\" In another part of the ground is a massive tomb over the grave of Sergeant-Major Shepherd, R.A., who was assassinated under circumstances related elsewhere. At the north-west corner of the church is a neat tomb erected by the Royal Marine Band, Woolwich division, to their comrade George Wilson, who died in 1853 ; and near the north-east end is a stone in memory of Sergeant-Major Fleming, died 1843, erected by the non-commissioned officers and men of the 9th Battalion R.A., lie having been their sergeant-major for eighteen years. Lieutenant William Robe, who was fifty-nine years in the artillery, and thirty years proof-master, died 1814, age eighty-one, and has a grave near the High Street entrance ; and on the same side of the ground is the tomb of Mr. Thomas Walton, who is described as having been sixty two years in the ordnance service and the inventor of instruments used in examining cannon. He died in 1830, aged eighty-four. Lewis's Topography says : \u2014 In Woolwich churchyard is the monument of Lieutenant-General Williamson, whose wife is lineally descended from Richard, king of Scotland.* There are several stately monuments from which the inscriptions have entirely disappeared, while others are kept in preservation with evident care. The one which is clearly the subject of most attention is that of Mrs. Anne Withers, that eminent benefactress of the parish ; and another which has preserved itself with remarkable endurance is that of a still more eminent friend of the church, Daniel Wiseman, Esq., who died in 1738. The inscription on the stone cover of his vault is so perfect as to induce a belief that it has been renewed at some more recent date in gratitude for the favours which he rendered the church at its rebuilding. The tomb of John Nelson, Esq., master shipwright of Chatham Dockyard, which is adjacent, is one of many evidences of the connection which existed between Woolwich and the sister yards during the last century*. Though conspicuously placed at the south-west corner of the church and of handsome proportions, the tomb of Mr. Samuel Hardin modestly speaks of him (who was the founder of a rich and broad estate) as a \" farmer and gardener,\" but commends his charity, good manners, his virtue, and piety. He died * Colonel Adam Williamson, their only son, married Anne, daughter of Thomas Jones, Esq., of East Wickham."], [271, "157 WOOLWICH. in 1803, aged eighty years. Similarly unpretentious is the description of Mr. John Hemlow (1736), who has a goodly monument, but is spoken of simply as a \"master house carpenter.\" The tomb of Henry Mauds lay, the grave of the boys who were drowned in the Bowater Pond, and the place where Charlotte Bees was laid, are all clearly visible from the public footpath crossing the churchyard, and all have their stories embalmed within these records. Of historical interest may also be the brief tale of heroism fast vanishing from the gravestone of Mr. William Sharp, of Woolwich, who \" while attempting to save the lives of two of his fellow-creatures, was himself unfortunately suffocated, January 26, 1797, in the thirty-fifth year of his age.\" Charles Loe has a cenotaph which tells his tragic end at the age of twenty, in 1825. He was \" struck by a whale in the South Seas.\" A singular -looking monument, shaped like a pepper-castor, is a memorial to the wife of William Harris, Esq., and is dated 1789 ; and there are many family tombs, on which may be read the names of \u2014 Strother (1804), Newhall, Church, Shersby, Graham, Remnant (1752), Waterfield, Slack, Wood (1761), Newell, McCoy, Pettigrew, Powrie (1786), Elcock, Dunlop, Sanders, Douthett, Heriot, Gates, Heaven, Tandy, Read, Reed, and Reid, Evans, Tappy, Spurting, Flick, Millar, Funge, Home, Giles, Venning, Adair, Campion, Austin, Davies, Sorrell, Mase, Prowse, Sales, Bush, Dunbar, Hone, Iceley, Cuthbert,.

There are two stones which appear to have been put up solely to remind the sexton that their owners paid, the one \u00a310 and the other \u00a320, into the Savings Bank that he might have the interest as his reward for keeping their graves in order. The church books also show that Mr. Loat left \u00a3100 consols by will, proved November 13, 1853, the interest to he expended on bread for the poor and on the repairs of his tomb. Mr. Hardin left \u00a3105 Three per Cents, for repair of his tomb ; and Mr. Fraser similarly left \u00a321 10s. 2d. in 1855.

Dock Rails.\u2014 As the high boundary wall which supports the steep side of the church yard on the north has been erected at a comparatively re cent date, the task of preserv ing this portion of the church yard has necessarily been a source of trouble to the church wardens through all recorded time. It is mentioned in the petition (page 149) as one of the reasons for rebuilding the church, and it has been the subject of many appeals to the Government. It is probable that the river washed the base Tom Cribb, 1805. of the acclivity at high tides, and an anchor was once dug up close to it,f but it is certain that at one time the hill sloped down to the shore, and it must be assumed that so long as Woolwich has existed the road which now takes the form of Dock Rails ran by the water's edge. The probability, however, has just been pointed out that in the early * Fistiana's record of Tom Cribb's \" war services \" is as follows : \u2014 Born at Hanham, Gloucester, July 8, 1781 ; w*eight, fourteen stone three pounds (champion and presented with a belt) ; beat Maddox, near Highgate, Jan. 7, 1805 ; beat Tom Blake at Blackheath, February 13, 1805 ; beat Ikey Pig at Blackheath, May 21, 1805 ; beaten by George Nicholls ; beat Richmond at Hailsham, October 8, 1805 ; beat Jem Belcher, two hundred pounds a side, at Moulsey, April 8, 1807 ; beat Horton, October 25, 1808 ; beat Jem Belcher, two hundred pound, at Epsom, February 1, 1809 ; beat, Molyneux (the black), two hundred pound a side and one hundred pound, Copt- hall Common, December 10, 1810 ; beat Molyneux, six hundred pound a side, at Leicester, September 28, 1811 (presented with a cup, value eighty guineas) ; beat Carter (room turn-up), Oxenden Street, February 1, 1820.

George Cribb, Tom's brother, fought and was beaten with unvarying monotony five time.. Tom Griffiths, who is buried close to Cribb, has five pitched battles to his record, in the last of which he was killed by his antagonist, Paddy Gill.

In the illustration at the beginning of this chapter (Plate XX.), which is found in an Admiralty survey made in 1698, the \"dock rails,\" which gave to this spot the name it still bears, are shown as they stood at that time when the river bank was an open promenade. In such circumstances it is more than possible that the tide invaded and damaged the road and its slight embankment. Repairs. \u2014 Among the State Papers of the reign of Charles I. there is the following report : \u2014 July 3, 1633. \u2014 From Edward Boate and F. Sheldon to the officers of the navy: \u2014 \" The highway leading from the town of Woolwich to the timber yard and'dock is very ruinous, and prejudicial to the King's service by stopping land carriage that way, and endangering the lives of those that are employed in his Majesty's works. They recommend that out of waste and unserviceable timber the officers should allot a proportion towards the repair thereof.\" The appeal was ineffectual, and shortly afterwards, when King Charles paid a visit to Woolwich, the inhabitants thought the opportunity might be turned to account by presenting his Majesty with a petition on the subject. The King accepted the petition, but he had other matters to think of, and the road was still neglected nearly a year after wards. Then a determined remonstrance was made to the Board of Admiralty in a memorial from the inhabitants to the following effect : \u2014 June 17, 1634. \u2014 Petitioners have for a long time been suitors for relief towards repair of a highway from Woolwich to Greenwich, which being formerly preserved by a timber wharf is now by the violence of the river quite decayed, so that the lives of passengers are endangered, the parish church is in hazard speedily to fall, and the bones of the dead are washed out of the churchyard into the river. The Lords formerly recommended the same to certain commissioners, but they found the road in question to be a parish way, belonging to petitioners. Petitioners also make humble suit to the King, in respect that by this way all provisions aud land carriages are convej'ed to the timber yard and dock. The King promised relief, but petitioners, not being able to hear anything of their petition since it was presented last year at Woolwich, and being themselves poor labouring men, relieved by his Majesty's works, now pray for an allotment of unserviceable timber out of his Majesty's yard towards the furtherance of this work. Annexed is a paper signed by the Bishop of Rochester and two others to the Justices of Assize for Kent, certifying that the required repairs would cost \u00a3200, and the parishioners are not able to expend that sum. There is also a report (June 25, 1634) from the master shipwright of the Dockyard, Phineas Pett, showing that during his employment at Woolwich in building the Prince Poi/al and Merhonour there bad been twice allowed a proportion of waste timber for the repair of thc highway leading from the town to the dockyard. 1.2"], [274, "160 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Faced by such precedents and backed by such authorities, the appli cation was entirely successful, and the Lords of the Admiralty at once resolved to support so good a work. The timber was granted, the land slipping of the churchyard hill was stayed, the roadway was mended, and the retaining fence which supported the dock rails on the water front was put in order. Indeed these repairs were done and continued, not only during the reign of King Charles the First, but also under the strict rule of the Commonwealth, for in 1650 Cromwell and the Council of State are reported to have repaired with waste timber from the State's dockyard a wharf leading thereto, 553 feet long and six feet deep, on petition from the inhabitants of Woolwich, who complained that no one could pass it without fear, and that it endangered the falling down ofthe church. Scandal, however, naturally arose from so questionable a practice, insomuch that it became necessary in 1663 for Christopher Pett, who was then master shipwright, to send a letter to the Navy Commissioners, informing them that a certain report which alleged that the stones bestowed upon the parish had been offered for sale was utterly false and unfounded. The truth he declared was that these said stones would be of essential service to the King (Charles II.) in mending the road from the \" Ropeyard to Woolwich \" * for the carriage of timber. The Churchyard Wall. \u2014 When the Mast-house was built and the Mast-pond constructed in 1784, and the foreshore enclosed at Dock Rails, the wall of the Dockyard was extended eastward to the corner of High Street, and then it probably was that some important and per- * Chris.

Some sort of retaining wall had been erected previously, and a State Paper of January 6th, 1745, speaks of the churchwardens being then about to build such a wall on the north side of the churchyard. The wall, however, was not very high, and the protection subsequently added seems to have been an inner wall on the terrace. In the accompanying drawing, which I have happily* lighted upon, the two walls are shown. The date of the picture is somewhere about 1780, for the original bears the impress of Sandby's hand, but there are living inhabitants who remember the two walls in existence. A Lych-gate. \u2014 Looking at this picture, however, I may confidently say that no one living ever saw, or, so far as I am aware, ever heard of, the gateway through which the people of a century since passed from High Street into the churchyard. It is not too much to imagine that this erection was an ancient lych-gate, at which the bearers of the dead rested their burdens on the way to the grave. The High Wall.\u2014 It was not until 1836 that the high wall which now keeps the churchyard from falling into Dock Rails was erected. We read that \u2014 On the 24th of August, 1836, the inhabitants of Woolwich met in vestry to receive tenders for carrying up the lofty boundary wall on the north side of the churchyard, and to make a rate for the expenses thereof as well as for the necessary repairs of the church. Mr. Noble's tender was accepted, and the churchwardens asked for a sixpenny rate. The collector said a threepenny rate would realise between \u00a3320 and \u00a3330, and Mr. Noble said it would cost \u00a31,500 for the erection of brick arches from the Horse and Star to the Hampshire Hog.* A letter was read from the arch deacon, recommending the parish to \" reclaim the old ground between the two walls.\" It was then proposed that a rate of fourpence only be granted and applied in paying for the boundary wall, and this was carried by 37 votes to 17. Thereupon a poll was taken in. favour of the sixpenny rate, which was endorsed by 248 ratepayers against 38 . The high wall was then built as we see it when we pass along the tramway. The eastern end, I may remark, appears to be of older date than the remainder, and to have consisted originally of arches. A Ghastly Revel. \u2014 The old churchyard seems to have at all times suffered from neglect, and its present state is perhaps not worse than its condition a hundred years ago. None of the tombs to-day would permit of a scene like the following, which was reported in the year 1780 :\u2014 Mr. Constable, who was steward for John Bowater, Esq., lord of the manor of Woolwich, passing through the churchyard at twelve o'clock at night, was surprised * Presumably the present Mitre, in High Street, and Golden Cross, in Church Street."], [276, "162 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. to hear a loud noise Uke that of several persons singing. At first he thought it proceeded from the church, but on going to the church doors he found them fast and all silent within. The noise still continuing, he looked round the churchyard and observed a light in one of the large family tombs, and, going up to it, he found some drunken sailors had got into the vault, and were regaling themselves with bread, cheese, tobacco, and strong beer. They told him they belonged to the Robust man-of-war, and that, having resolved to spend a jolly night on shore, they had kept it up at the Ship and Punch Bowl till they were turned out by the landlord, and were obliged to take shelter there to finish tlie evening. Clearing the Ground. \u2014 The condition of the churchyard did not improve with years, and on the 14th of February, 1838, we find an advertisement issued by tbe churchwardens to the following effect : \u2014 Whereas many of the tombs and stones in Woolwich churchyard have become dilapi dated, notice is hereby given to the parties claiming a right to the same, that if they do not come forward before the 15th day of March next and have them repaired, they will be removed and the ground appropriated, viz. : \u2014 Tomb of Elizabeth Andrews, 1737, and Edward Purnell, 1799 ; of William Baylis, 1785 ; Thomas Hooke, 1714 ; the Hon.

PARSONS AND PARISHIONERS. The Old Rectory. \u2014 Akin to the subjects of the church and churchyard is the parsonage house. This formerly stood in \" the Grove \" by the river-side, with its back upon High Street. Its position is shown in the plan prepared by John Barker in 1748 (page 41), and part of the site is now occupied by the shops west of Enon Chapel. The parsonage is known to have stood on the same spot for some hundreds of years. It is mentioned in the Close Rolls of Queen Eliza beth in connection with the following transaction : \u2014 Oct. 25th, 1568.\u2014 John Martin of Woolwich, yeoman, sold, for \u00a3200, to William Maresam, Robert Broke, and Richard Hall, citizens and grocers of London, a great messuage, with barns, stables, orchards, and wharf, and four tenements and gardens, and a wharf adjoining the great tenement, in Woolwich, between the Queen's highway (east) the parsonage of Woolwich (west) the Thames (north) and the high way leading from Woolwich Church, and the tenement of Richard Heywood, Esq. (south).* The parsonage remained the parsonage until early in this century. In 1809 it was represented to Parliament that the old parsonage house was \" small, decayed, and badly situated by the banks of the Thames,\" and in the same year the Rev. Hugh Fraser, rector, sup ported by the Bishop of Rochester, obtained an Act empowering them to sell the old parsonage, and let seventeen of the total twenty acres of the glebe on building leases for ninety-nine years, in order to raise a sum of \u00a33,000 for the purpose of building a new rectory-house, which was finished in 1811. The old house and garden were sold for \u00a31,000; the house was pulled down in 1811, t and on its site and in the garden, we are told, \" several neat houses \" were erected. The New Rectory. \u2014 The present rectory which we see in Rectory Place was built on the glebe in the midst of three acres of garden, orchard, and pasture, which have since been considerably curtailed. The remainder of the glebe was advertised to be let under the Act for * This exact description evidently applies to the great house previously spoken of at page 45 and fixes its precise locality, which appears to have been the site of the Consumers' Gas Works. t Lysons' Supplement."], [278, "164 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. raising the \u00a33,000, but the sale ofthe leases did not realise the sum re quired, and a loan of \u00a32,000 had to be obtained on security of the living at the heavy interest of eight and a half per cent. This was a pressing burden upon Mr. Fraser and his successor until, with the help of subsequent sales, it was paid off. The Rector's Glehe. \u2014 The glebe lands extended from the church yard to Rectory Grove, and embraced the whole area from Mulgrave Place to the back of Church Street. In February and March, 1849, there was a sale of 280 houses on the glebe land, and they were described as situated in Rectory Place, St. Mary Street, * King Street, parts of Sun Alley and Parson's Hill, form ing \"from the memory of man\" part of the glebe of the rectory. The property, which was of the estimated value of \u00a34,000, was sold under the power of an Act passed in the previous session of Parliament, entitled \" an Act for the sale ofthe glebe lands belonging to the rectory of Woolwich, in the county of Kent, and to confirm the building leases of such lands, and for the endowment of a new district t and for other purposes.\" An \" apportionment of rent charge in lieu of tithes for the parish of Woolwich,\" confirmed by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners on Sep tember 30th, 1846, is as follows : \u2014 Total area 1,200 acres, of which 399 are marsh land, 144 upland pasture, 120 gardens, and the remainder occupied by houses, roads, wastes, and sites for building. Rent-charge payable to the rector in lieu of all manner of tithes, moduses, and customary payments arising from all lands in the said parish, except the glebe, \u00a3183 6s. 8d., out of which the sums of \u00a31 9s. and \u00a31 3s. 6d. have been redeemed by the South Eastern Railway Company and Mr. Gregory Browne respectively.

The Sunday school-room appears to have been removed when the National Schools were built, which was in 1840. The infant schools date from 1877. The Vestry Books. \u2014 Much that is interesting may be learnt from the old vestry minutes and churchwardens' accounts, from which the following extracts are presented : \u2014 1698, May 16th. Relieved a minister who came from the north bound to Canter bury, ls. \u201e Paid Rob. Hopkins for a fox's head, ls. June 13th.

Whereas, it hath been the constant practice of several inhabitants of this parish at the time of the perambulation of the bounds thereof, and also at the visitation, to resort to the place appointed by the churchwardens for those meetings, and there to intrude themselves, with no other intent or design than to eat and drink, and so put the parish to extraordinary charge : Ordered \u2014 that no inhabitant, saving the minister only, shall on those days have or partake of anything for Breakfast, Dinner, or otherwise, by the churchwardens' order, unless such person or persons who come with intent to go to the said bounds, do first deposit or pay into the hands of the churchwardens eighteenp ence towards the charges and expenses of the parish for that day. 1726, May 22nd.

Curious Wills. \u2014 The following remarkable allusions to Woolwich Church are found in some very ancient wills. It will be observed that they all bear date prior to the Dissolution and Reformation : \u2014 1455, Oct. 1st. Thomas Heth, of Woolwich, who was buried in the Porch of the Blessed Mary, Woolwich, leaves to the high altar, 13s. 4d., to the fabric of the said church, 20s. ; four wax candles at my funeral (the greatest not to exceed 5 lbs.), and four torches (various other bequests), residue to William Lovelace,+ of Bretresden, Kent, supervisor, &c. 1462, Oct. 4th. Thos.

Margaret Egle, widow, directs by her will that she is to be buried in the churchyard by the Palm Cross, and leaves a house to the church to find a lamp burning there, as my husband's will was, also legacies for diriges and masses and repairs of the church.

Early Telegraphy. \u2014 Several drawings of Woolwich Church (dating from 1790 to 1800) show the semaphore telegraph on the tower by which messages were sent to ships up and down the river in the latter Woolwich Church and Semaphore, 1790. part of the last and the early part of the present century, and I have inserted one to illustrate this phase of its history. As lately as 1847 the tower was made use of for similar purposes, for in that yTear Mr. Ruegg wrote \u2014 Woolwich Church may be seen for some miles up and down the river, and when any visitor of importance is expected from the continent, a watch is kept from its tower, and the hoisting of the standard on its flagstaff intimates to the authorities the moment the steamer arrives in sight.

Church Rates. \u2014 During the last century, before people had dis covered how to do without church rates, the sum of about \u00a3200 per annum was raised for the church by a charge of something like two shillings in the pound, the assessment being low and the excusals many. In these church rates it was usual to include Burrage House, Plum stead, and all the property down to Cole Fields, at the bottom of Dead man's Lane (Vicarage Road). From this fact I have supposed that a large portion of Plumstead was at that time in Woolwich, and that the division line was that adopted at the formation of the borough of Greenwich in 1832 \u2014 a line drawn from the Storekeeper's House (Middle Arsenal Gates) to the stile at the top of Sandy Hill. There are, however, paramount reasons for concluding that the boundary between the two parishes was at all times the Brook Hill stream, and it may therefore be inferred \u2014 firstly, that the residents at Burrage House, &c, paid rates to Woolwich Church in return for the privileges of worshipping there ; and, secondly, that the borough boundary may have been extended into Plumstead in order to embrace the few houses which had grown up on the borders of Woolwich. Church rates at Woolwich were continued until 1859, when a pro posed rate was defeated at a poll by a majority of 702 to 591, and no attempt to enforce upon the parish the care and maintenance of the church has since been made. Woolwich Cemetery. \u2014 In connection with the closing of the churchyard, it has been necessary to mention Woolwich Cemetery. The beautiful burial-ground which fronts the King's Highway on the eastern slope of Plumstead Common was opened as a cemetery for the parish of Woclwich on January 3rd, 1856, in pursuance of a poll taken a year earlier. It was consecrated on the ecclesiastical side byr the Bishop of Oxford, the whole having been purchased and laid out at a cost of \u00a36,200, raised by a loan repayable in twenty years. Adding to the Cemetery. \u2014 The ground, consisting of nearly twelve acres, was practically absorbed in thirty years. In that period 25,517 burials took place in the cemetery, and it became necessary to obtain more space. Accordingly, taking time by the forelock, a vestry meeting was called on 21st December, 1883, and sanction obtained without a poll to purchase twenty acres of land adjacent. The cost of this, with the laving out, and building a wall round both the enclosures, was estimated at \u00a314,000. This also has been raised by loan, and the new ground was opened on the 23rd of December, 1885, on which date the church portion was consecrated by the Bishop of Rochester. Memorials in the Cemetery. \u2014 We may here glance at some of the tombs and memorials in Woolwich Cemetery.

The first stone was laid with much ceremony on the 6th of June, 1833, being the same month in which the company was formed. In 1834 the building was opened, and for sixteen years, i.e. until 1850, it was conducted as a proprietary chapel under tbe ministry of the Rev.

Duncan Long, M.A., held the position for about one year, and in 1852 the church was consecrated by Bishop Blomfield (Wool wich being at that time in the diocese of London), having been purchased from the proprietors by a subscription raised by the rector, the Rev. H. Brown, the War Department giving \u00a31,000. The church then ceased to be proprietary, and became a chapel of ease to the parish church. The Rev. Thomas Reynolds, M.A., was appointed minister of the church in 1852, and retained that post until 1860. In 1860 the Rev. James Stewart Ruddock, M.A., succeeded to the ministry, and remained until 1869. In 1867 the Rev. James White, M.A., came as assistant curate to Mr. Ruddock, and in 1869 succeeded him as minister of the church, continuing until 1877.* From 1877 to 1879 the rector of Woolwich, the Hon. and Rev. A. Anson, with the help of curates, conducted the services, being also assisted for a part of the time by the Rev. T. Hutton. On February 7th, 1879, the Rev. J. Jordan entered upon the duties of minister of the church, and on the 13th of March, 1881, Holy Trinity was exalted to the position of a separate parish, Mr. Jordan being appointed the first vicar. The work prospered in his hands, and a vicarage was provided in Rectory Place, but a severe illness compelled him to retire on October 1st, 1888 ; and he died at Shanklin, November 10th, 1888. St. Thomas's.* \u2014 The district of St. Thomas was formed of sections taken from the mother parishes of Woolwich and Charlton in 1844. The church was commenced in 1847, and finished, consecrated, and opened in 1850. It cost between \u00a35,000 and \u00a36,000.

Before October 8th, 1869, St. John's was but a chapel of ease to the parish church, but on that date (when Canon Brown was rector) the parish of St. John, Woolwich, became a separate ecclesiastical district under an order in Council. The Rev. G. C. Bateman succeeded the Rev. E. C. Lefroy as curate at Michaelmas, 1880, and remained until 1887, when he was transferred to a living in Devonshire, and was succeeded by the Rev. F. L. Goslett, M.A. St. Michael and All Angels. \u2014 The church and district of St. Michael and All Angels originated in a mission work instituted by the Rev. Hugh Ryves Baker, the present vicar, in 1866, a schoolroom, which was also used for services, being formed out of a skittle alley. In 1869, a site having been secured by the Bishop of London's Fund, a temporary building was opened. In 1871 the permanent schools were ready, and in 1874 the church, or portion of a church,* was begun. The foundation stone of the chancel was laid on July 15th, 1875. On July 1st, 1878, the consecration took place. The patronage is vested in Keble College, Oxford. The sum of \u00a315,000 has been raised to carry on the work, as part of which a mission chapel has been established, and a vicarage provided at Haricesher House.

Its early records will be found elsewhere, its original purpose having been a chapel associated towards the end of last century with the Countess of Huntington and Mr. Whitfield, and under the ministry of Dr. Percy. The date of its acquirement by the Board of Ordnance cannot be ascertained, but it was probably about 1797. t At the beginning of this century the building was used as a Government store for a number of years, and it was then fitted up as a chapel for the use of the civil departments of the Royal Arsenal. Service was performed in it by the chaplain of the Royal Military Academy in the Arsenal. Lysons speaks of it as a chapel in 1811, and the Church property includes a prayer-book lettered on the cover * The edifice comprised a chancel, side chapel, vestries, and organ chamber. t The late Mr. Edwards, stationer, of High Street, thought it was in Dr. Percy's time, and between 1788 arid 17$.. 1 fix 1797 by the receeds of Salem Chapel.

To this date (1857) it had continued directly under the control of the War Department, and for most of the time was attended by the corps of Royal Sappers and Miners (Royal Engineers). But from that year until 1873 the Government took little interest in it, and the services were carried on by curates under the vicars of Plumstead, to whom the building was lent as a chapel of ease to the parish church. The greater part of the building is, however, in Woolwich, as may be seen by the boundary mark in Plumstead Road. At length the War Office resumed charge of the building, and the Rev. Charles Berry was appointed to conduct it, with the rank of Chaplain of the Arsenal, in 1873. An Older Arsenal Chapel. \u2014 There was at one time a place of worship inside the Arsenal.

The Garrison Church. \u2014 St. George's (the Garrison) Church was built in 1863 on a site selected by Lord Sidney Herbert, Secretary of State for War, shortly before his death, and was modelled on a structure erected by that nobleman at his residence in Wiltshire. The War Department contributed \u00a318,000 towards the cost, but the burden of the internal decorations was borne by the Royal Regiment of Artillery. The edifice was consecrated in November, 1863. It is very rich in memorials, mostly of modern date. The windows are nearly all of stained glass given to commemorate the names of brave soldiers. At the western end above the gallery is a handsome rose window in memory of Lord Herbert, erected by his widow. The five windows in the chancel are in honour of the Royal Artillerymen who fell during the war with France 1808 \u2014 15, and the war with Russia 1854 \u2014 55.

CHAPTER XVII NONCONFORMITY. Early Dissenters. \u2014 There are few traces of early dissent from the established form of worship to be found in the records of Woolwich. In the year 1662 the rector of the parish, the Rev. William Hawkes, was ejected from the Church for an offence against the Act of Uniformity, but it is not known whether he had any following, or whether he con tinued any kind of ministration apart from the orthodoxy. The First Chapel. \u2014 In 1689 the Act of Toleration was passed, and shortly afterwards a small wooden building for public worship was provided near the \" Sheep Stairs.\" * I have but recently learnt that this vanguard of nonconformity was named \" Bethel.\" It was usually known as \" the meeting house,\" and the little street which led to it is still called \"Meeting House Lane.\" One of its first ministers was the Rev. Samuel Oldfred, whose ordination took place on April * Now \" Ship Stairs,\" or \" Ship and Half-moon Stairs,\" Rodney Street."], [295, "179 WOOLWICH. 14th, 1698. After him came the Rev. George Jacomb, and then the Rev. Emmanuel Ellerke, who died after one year in 1727 ; the Rev. Joseph Stokes, 1728 ; and the Rev. Benjamin Stokes in 1735. The last named was shut out of the meeting house, but was restored by the Committee of Deputies ; at his death iu 1772 the congregation was dispersed, and some money which was left to it was claimed by another community. Until 1756, the meeting house had been the only place of worship in Woolwich excepting the parish church. Mr. Ranwell, in a pamphlet * published in 1837, stated that \" the small dissenting place \" was still standing in Meeting House Lane, and that it had at one time been occupied by the Scotch Presbyterians, who were \" few in number, only meeting for worship twice on the Lord's Day.\" The Oldest existing Chapel. \u2014 Enon Chapel was the first Baptist sanctuary established in Woolwich. In 1754 a small community of twelve persons was drawn together by mutual inclination, and one of them in 1756 built a small meeting house in Hog Lane (Nile Street). It was opened on the 10th of October in that year, when Mr. R. McGregor preached and became the pastor. So rapidly did the con gregation increase, that the building was soon found insufficient, and in 1761 a chapel was built on the site now occupied by \" Enon \" in High Street. This too was overcrowded before many years were past, and the present building was erected on the same ground and opened in July, 1775. Enon Chapel is therefore the oldest nonconformist place of worship in the parish. Early Persecution. \u2014 The dissenting movement was naturally disliked by those who remained faithful to the Establishment, but its aggressors were really the vulgar and ungodly people of the town, who persecuted the early Baptists without stint or mercy. The pastor was openly insulted in the public street, and his effigy was drawn through the town upon an ass, labelled \u2014 \"McGregor, the Baptist Parson.\" One of the enemy, however, was smitten by the truth. He went to scoff and stayed to prav, became an earnest Christian, and was after wards a successful minister of the gospel at Reading. Mr. McGregor remained for the long period of forty-seven years in charge of the chapel, and when he became incapacitated by reason of his age, Mr. W. Culver was chosen (in 1799) his co-pastor. Mr. McGregor had founded and nourished the Sabbath school, and sent out * *' The Memory of the Blessed, or Biographical Sketches of some Persons connected with the First Baptist Church, Woolwich, with an Account of the Introduction of the Gospel into the Town,\" by William Ranwell, senior deacon."], [296, "180 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. workers from Enon to preach and set up schools in the villages of Kent. He saw a great improvement in the moral and religious aspect of Woolwich before his death, which took place at the age of eighty-eight years, in April, 1804. He was interred under the chapel. Mr. Culver was pastor till his death in 1827, a period of thirty j'ears. During Ms time the little church suffered the loss of many workers by a great reduction in the Government establishments after the battle of Waterloo. Mr. Bowes succeeded on the decease of Mr. Culver, but after nine years resigned the pastorate to take a charge in London. Mr. Galpine then held the office for a short time. Mr. C. Box was chosen pastor in 1839, and for thirty-two years was active in the cause. He resigned in 1871, through age, but continued to attend until his death in 1881. Mr. Lynn and Mr. Brittain held the pastorate for the ten years following Mr. Box, and in 1881 the present minister, Mr. W. K. Squirrel, commenced his labours. Many of the deacons of Enon have held long service. Mr. C. Wren was in office for twenty-four years, and died in 1807, leaving the interest of \u00a32,000 to educate poor children, which has been a great blessing. Mr. AV. Ranwell was deacon for fifty-four years. Mr. R. Abrahams, the present senior deacon, has been connected with the cliurch for forty-six years, during thirty-one of which he has held office. Mr. Wren was one of the first promoters of Sabbath schools, but long before such schools were thought of it was customary to assemble children in tbe chapel on Sundays for religious instruction. In later years a large room was hired, and several places of worship united in teaching the children there before they went to their respective chapels. Queen Street Chapel. \u2014 Queen Street Chapel was a Baptist off shoot from Enon Chapel in Hign iStreet. In 1786 Mr. Adam Freeman and twenty-four others withdrew trcm Enon on the question of free or open communion. They met for some time in a large room in the Market Place,* and then erected the present chapel in Queen Street. The Rev. Adam Freeman was ordained first pastor on March 10th, 1789. The Rev. John Cox joined as co-pastor with Mr. Freeman, and afterwards had sole charge. He was formally recognised as pastor on April 16th, 1833, and remained until his resignation on September 16th, 1854. The Rev. Charles Hawson succeeded Mr. Cox on his retirement, February 26th, 1856. The Rev. John Teall followed, entering on his charge August 11th, 1861, and resigning March 28th, 1877. The Rev. Thomas Jones succeeded to the pastorate April 2nd, 1877. A view of Queen Street Chapel, drawn in 1835, is at page 26. * On the site of the Steamboat Company's Dock."], [297, ""], [298, "PLATE XXTT.

The Congregational Church. \u2014 The Countess of Huntingdon, in promoting the revival of religion led by Whitfield and Wesley during the latter half of the last century, established some of her missionaries at Woolwich, amongst them being the Rev. R. Shrubsole and the Rev. Mr. Cross. Mr. Shrubsole came from Sheerness to be master-mast maker at Woolwich, and the Countess of Huntingdon invited him \" to preach at her chapel in the Plumstead Road and to superintend its spiritual concerns,\" which he did in 1773 for a period of seven months. This appears to have been the origin of the Ordnance Chapel or Royal Arsenal Chapel, now and for many years past the property of the Crown.* The Rev. Dr. William Percy, who filled this same chapel with (we are told) \" a fine congregation,\" was also one ofthe Countess's ministers, and was appointed in 1782. Salem Chapel. \u2014 The Rev. J. Wilcox Percy, brother of Dr. Percy, was engaged to assist at the Plumstead Road Chapel in 1796. When the Plumstead Road Chapel was sold to the Government, the site in Powis Street was selected for a new sanctuary. The foundation was laid Sep tember 14th, 1798, and Salem Chapel was finished and dedicated June 4th, 1799. The Rev. J. W. Percy held the pastorate until August, 1820. On the first Sunday of that month he preached from Psalm xliii. 4, \" I will go unto the altar of God,\" when he was seized with sudden illness and died in a few days. A tablet erected in the chapel stated that he was for twenty-four years minister of the congregation, that he died on August 16th, 1820, in the seventieth year of his age, and that, in token of pious respect, his mortal remains were \" deposited beneath the table pew.\" Salem chose as its pastor after Mr. Percy the Rev. Thomas James, who took charge on October 24th, 1821. He increased the congrega tion so much that more accommodation was needed, and the chapel was enlarged at a cost of \u00a31,200, and reopened September 23rd, 1829. The collections on the opening day exceeded \u00a350, and it was remarked that there were at that time no fewer than eighteen places of worship in Woolwich. Mr. James remained from 1821 to 1843, when he resigned. The Rev. J. S. Bright, of Luton, Bedfordshire, succeeded him, but remained only until 1847, when he removed to the Independent church at Dorking, Surrey. The Rev. Dr. Carlisle next accepted the charge, but in 1852 the old community began to show signs of decay, being sapped by the new growth which has become the vigorous Congregational church of Rectory Place. From the minute book of the Congregational church at Salem Chape * Page 175."], [300, "182 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. which covers the period between 1839 and 1843, we have not only some details of an unhappy controversy between two of its members which throw a light upon the subsequent division, but also some further information on the subject of the church's first establishment at Woolwich. From February 20th, 1798, until his decease in August, Rectory Placi Congregational Church, Woolwich. 1820, Mr. Percy admitted into fellowship 238 members, of whom 154 died or had withdrawn or been expelled, leaving at his death 81. From 1821, when the Rev. Thomas James took oversight of the church, until 1839, he was reported to have admitted 180 members, leaving at that date 115 in actual fellowship. The church thereafter appears to have declined in numbers and in spirit, and in 1852 the young off shoot just mentioned withered the parent trunk, Services were still carried on at Salem under various ministers for several years, but at length the building fell into the hands of the London School Board, and now forms part of Powis Street Schools. It was on April 5th, 1852, that eight Sunday school teachers con nected with this place resolved upon founding \" another Christian interest on Congregational prin, ciples.\" A document read at the laying of the foundation of Rectory Place Church on November 3rd, 1858, stated that \u2014 This cause was originated by Thomas R.

On August 23rd, 1852, a church was formed of forty-two members. On September 7th, 1852, divine worship commenced in the Masonic Hall, William Street. On April 24th, 1853, the Rev.

Rectory Place. \u2014 During Mr. Gill's highly successful pastorate the new church in Rectory Place was resolved upon, planned, built, and paid for. On November 3rd, 1858, the memorial stone of the church was laid, and on June 28th, 1859, the opening services were held. The cost, .\u00a37,000, was entirely defrayed in seven years.

Carpenter, of Devonport, was appointed, but retired through ill health on December 19th, 1870, and died May 16th, 1871. On March 3rd, 1871, the Rev. Thomas Sissons, of Bishopsgate Street Chapel, London, became pastor, and remained until March 18th, 1884, when he accepted a similar charge at Beckenham. On July 31st, 1884, he was succeeded by the Rev. A. J. Viner, of London. The Sunday school numbers about four hundred, and there are two hundred and seventy scholars at the Mission Station in PeUipar road. The Preshyterians. \u2014 The Presbyterian Church was established in Woolwich as early as 1662, prior to the Great Fire and Plague of London and the Dutch War, prior to the passing of the Conventicle Act, and therefore early enough to endure persecutions under that Act and the other repressive measures which sullied the periods of Charles II. and his successors. We have no evidence of any build ing devoted to the Presbyterian form of worship in the early days, and probably, after the manner of the Covenanters, its disciples met in the open air ; but about 1756, as will be seen from the records of Enon Chapel, the Scotch Presbyterians appear to have made use for a time of the old meeting house in Meeting House Lane, High Street. Scotch Church, Xew Road. \u2014 At a later date, which I cannot trace, the Scots built a church at the corner of Green's End and Powis Street \u2014 an unpretending structure in a roomy graveyard and screened by trees, just discernible in the view of Beresford Square on Plate XII. Here they met until 1842, when they migrated to New Road. The following account appears under date of October 8th, 1841 : \u2014 The present church in which the Presbyterian form of worship is performed by a clergyman of the Established Church of Scotland being far too small for the congregation, the minister and influential members commenced a subscription to build a new church and schools, and have succeeded in raising \u00a32,856, besides having obtained an eligible piece of ground of ample dimensions from the Board of Ordnance. Wednesday the foundation-stone was laid by Lieut.-Colonel Dundas, C.B., Royal Artillery, and presented an imposing spectacle. The proceedings * He was afterwards useful in other labours, and in 1885 went to North Adelaid Australia, where he was elected chairman of the Congregational Union, and died in 1888."], [302, "184 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. commenced at one o'clock in the present church, and the procession formed in the following order : \u2014 The Beadle of the Church. School Children. Non-commissioned Officers and Men of the Royal Artillery, about five hundred, that being the average of Presbyterians in the corps at Woolwich. Then the Royal Sappers and Miners, &c. The Builder and Architect. The Ministers and Office Bearers. Then a division of tbe Royal Artillery closed the Procession. At the conclusion of the proceedings the Royal Artillery band played \" God save the Queen.\" The records of the ministry in a connected line carry us back in four long strides to 1797, and they are as follows : \u2014 Rev. John Blythe . . . Feb., 1797, to Oct., 1829. Rev. Dr. Scott .... 1830 \u201e 1837. Rev. W. M. Thompson . . Aug., 1838 \u201e Dec., 1876. Rev. Dr. Raitt .... Dec., 1876 (still serving) Dr. Scott was afterwards Professor of English Literature in the University of London, and Principal of Owens College, Manchester. He was obliged to leave the Presbytery in consequence of having adopted dissentient views. During tbe very long service of the Rev. W. M. Thompson he had as his colleagues the Rev. W. Cousin, now of Lady Glenorchy's Free Church, Edinburgh, and the Rev. J. Nisbet Wallace, now of the Presbyterian Church, Swindon. The prejudice against the employment of instrumental music in divine worship, which was for long a denial to the Scotch Church, has lately been overcome at this and most other Presbyterian places of worship. A good organ and choir have been provided. St. Andrew's. \u2014 The large and influential congregation of Presby- terians now worshipping in St. Andrew's Church, Anglesea Hill, had a small beginning. Twenty-six years ago (1862) a few Presbyterians met in a room in the Royal Arsenal and resolved to petition the London Presbytery to open a preaching station in connection with the United Presbyterian Church. The old Congregational church in Powis Street (Salem Chapel), now used as a Board school, was taken at a rent of \u00a370, and a committee of management, who charged themselves with the expense, was organised. In November, 1862, the Rev. R. Balgarnie (now Dr. Balgarnie) w*as ordained as the first pastor, and under his ministry the congregation increased steadily. In 1868 it removed from Salem Chapel to an iron church on the site of the present building. In 1871 the foundation stone of the present church was laid by James E. Matheson, Esq., and in May, 1872, the church was opened by the Rev. Donald"], [303, "185 WOOLWICH. Fraser, D.D. The original outlay was over _\u00a35,000, but since that time a gallery, heat ing furnaces, organ loft, and choir gallery have been added, so that the whole outlay has been about _\u00a38,000.* In 1879, Dr. Balgarnie having accepted a call to Gravesend, the Rev. A. Craig was inducted to the pastorate. Owing, however, to weak health he was compelled to resign on July 12th, 1881, and seek a field of labour in New South Wales. The present pastor is Dr. Rentoul, who was inducted on the 23rd of February, 1882. The congregation is in a very flourishing condition. Of the original committee of management one alone remains still in office, Mr. James Ronald, who is at present both an elder and a manager in the church. After the terrible accident at Shoeburyness on the 26th of February, 1885, in which, out of nine persons around the shell which burst, seven were killed, the congregation of St. Andrew's erected a stained glass window in their church as a token of their gratitude to God for the escape of Mr. Robert Low, manager of the Royal Laboratory in the Arsenal. The window bears the following inscription : \u2014 Erected by this congregation as a token of our gratitude to God for the preserva tion of our esteemed friend and fellow-worshipper, Mr. Robert Low, in the explosion at Shoeburyness, on February 26th, 1885. Mr. Low on his restoration to health presented the congregation with two stained-glass windows, the centre window on each side of tbe church being his gift. Carmel Chapel. \u2014 Carmel Chapel in Anglesea Road was erected in 1856. The congregation had previously gathered and prospered at a small edifice bearing the same name in New Road, the site of which is now partly covered by the Gun Tavern. We read something of its origin in an old magazine published under the title of The Earthen- Vessel as follows : \u2014 Formation op another Baptist Church at Woolwich. \u2014 On Lord's Day, January 13th, 1850, a church was formed on strict Baptist principles at Carniel Chapel, New Road, Woolwich. In the morning Mr. Israel Atkinson, who has been for some time supplying here, preached to the people. In the afternoon Mr. John Foreman addressed the congregation on the nature and constitution of a Gospel church The order of a Gospel church he proved from the New Testament to be strict communion, admitting none others to the table of the Lord than those who had previously made a public profession by baptism by immersion Mr. J. A. Jones then asked for some account of the leadings of Divine Providence, which had led them to take Carmel Chapel, and to form themselves into a church. This ques tion was answered by one of the members, who read a plain statement of facts. Mr. Jones then requested that those who were about to become members of the church would stand up and hold up their right hand as a token of the same, which they did. \" Now,\" said John Andrew Jones, \" having thus publicly given yourselves to God, give yourselves to one another, as did the disciples of old, by turning round and * In 1886 a bazaar held in the room under the church to clear off the debt realised within a little of \u00a31,000."], [304, "186 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. giving each other the right hand of fellowship.\" This they did, and the ordinance of the Lord's Supper was then administered. The newly-formed church consists of about twenty or twenty-five members. At the exodus, and for many years afterwards, Carmel was under the pastorate of the Rev. H. Hanks, who died on December 26, 1882, aged seventy-one years. The little chapel in New Road which was the birthplace of \" Car mel\" was previously called \"Providence Chapel,\" and was held under \" Lady Huntingdon's connection \" first by Mr. Bickerdike and after wards by the Rev. W. Woodlands, and had a scattered congregation, who at length united with the people of Union Chapel in Sun Street, where Mr. Woodlands was pastor for many years. Parson's Hill Chapel. \u2014 It was about the year 1855 that a portion of the congregation at Queen Street Chapel had occasion to Parsons Hill Chapel, Woolwich. differ with the administration and sormed a separate camp, setting up their standard at the Lecture Hall over the Baths in Nelson Street, under the leadership of the Rev. Harris Crassweller. Here they continued to worship according to the ordinances of the Baptist Church until the new chapel at Parson's Hill was opened in 1857. Mr. Crassweller left about 1864, and shortly afterwards the Rev. W."], [305, "187 WOOLWICH. Woods took charge, remaining until the year 1869, when his place was taken by the Rev. J. Manley Camp. After four years in the work Mr. Camp also left, and the Rev. J. Turner became the pastor and did zealous service until 1879, when he retired, and the congrega tion, like a flock without a shepherd, dispersed, the chapel being left to the care of the London Baptist Association. It did not long remain unoccupied, for the Rev. John Wilson, who had been preaching in the vicinity for a short time previously, made application to the Association and was installed at Parson's Hill, where, with remarkable energy and devotion, he has established the present large and united community. The debt of \u00a31,000 which Mr. Wilson encountered was boldly increased by \u00a3700 for the erection of galleries, but the whole encumbrance was speedily swept away, and the young society set out for new fields of labour. The Mission Chapel at New Beckton was erected at a cost of nearly \u00a3600, the chapels at Joseph Street, Woolwich, and at Silver town are likewise branches of this trunk, and services are held in con nection with the same head at both the Royal Assembly Rooms and the Co-operative Hall. The roll of membership, which numbered but 90 when the present minister began, contains now over 700 names, and there are 500 children in the Sunday schools. The Wesleyan Methodists. \u2014 The brick building which is now the Steam Flour-mills in New Road was the first Wesleyan chapel at Woolwich, and was opened by Mr. George Phillips and bis two brothers, eleven years before the close of last century. The building afterwards became the Roman Catholic church,* for it was vacated by the Wesleyans in 1816, when they erected their present chapel in William Street. Woolwich was in the East London Circuit until 1811, when it was constituted part ofthe Deptford Circuit, and so remained until 1849, the year in which the Woolwich Circuit was constituted. The following is a succession list of ministers of the Woolwich Circuit : \u2014 1849. The Rev. Robert Newstead. 1849. The Rev. Peter Prescott, jun. 1850\u20142. The Rev. Robert Thompson. 1850.

The Birth of a Church. \u2014 One of the founders of Wesleyanism in Woolwich, indeed its avant-coureur, has left an autobiography in MS., which affords a complete record of the outspring of the present large and flourishing circuit. He was a working carpenter, born in 1750 at Upminster, Essex, and was a member of the Established Church until 1782. He resided for some years at Purfleet, where he joined a little society led by Mr. Weaver, a devout disciple of Mr. Wesley, and on the 26th of July, 1786, he came to Woolwich to work in \"The Warren.\" He says \u2014 I wished to continue at Purfleet, for I could not embrace the Calvinistic doctrine with which Woolwich was deluged. Here was none of Mr. Wesley's people, no class-meeting. I constantly attended the preaching at Mr. Percy's,* and also the Baptist chapels, and sometimes at the church. I also attended all their prayer meetings, but they would not suffer me to pray with them, except I would abandon Mr. Wesley's opinions and principles. Sometimes I have been detained at night by Congregational, now Ordnance or Arsenal Chapel, Plumstead Road."], [307, "189 WOOLWICH. the Baptists in Mr. McGrigor's chapel.* In October, 1786, Mr. Witten, an engraver in the Tower of London, came down to the Royal Artillery Barracks in order to engrave some arms. In the evening we met in Green's End, and he told me he intended to preach that evening in a room at Ropeyard Rails. I promised to be there if I could find the place. I did, and the room was almost filled with attentive hearers. After the service we went with Mr. Richard Mills, an invaUd t of the Royal ArtiUery, to his little cottage Mr. MiUs asked me to call upon him some evening, and, as there was no preaching nor prayer-meetings on Monday night at any of the chapels in Woolwich, I was led. to choose Monday night, and caUed upon him. The blessing of the Lord was upon us. This was in a small house in Warren Lane. I continued to go every Monday night, and the good old man began to invite his neighbours to come to his house, saying he would have a young man there who would pray with them and for them. In the deed many attended, and sometimes more than the room would contain.. The latter end of November, a young man, Joseph Johnson, came from London and got employment in the Dockyard. He by some means while in London heard there was a Methodist in Woolwich, and that he belonged to the Warren. He came into the Warren and inquired for me, and as he did not know my name he inquired for a Methodist until he found me. We agreed to meet at Mr. Percy's chapel, Plumstead Road. About the middle of December he proposed to me to form a class. It was proposed to the people at the prayer-meeting, and it was agreed to meet on Thursday evenings. Our first meeting in class was on the first Thursday in the new year, 1787. Brother Johnson did not come ; we were but four in number. The next Thursday we added two more, and the class increased. Although many of them were Calvinists, they were desirous of Mr. Wesley's preachers amongst *us, but none would come. I next went to Mr. John Wesley and applied to him for some of the local preachers. Mr. Wesley did not deny my request, nor give me any promise, but he told me to go back to Woolwich, and said, \" You wiU be the seed of a society there.\" I answered him, \" No, sir ; the seed is not good.\" Soon after I went to Purfleet to my friend Mr. Weaver, and he proposed that he would come to Woolwich and preach once every month, free from expense, upon condition that I could get three more local preachers, so as to have preaching every Sunday. I went to Dept ford, and Mr. Jacobs agreed to come once a month ; also Mr. Phillips, who, in about two years and a half after, built the chapel in the New Road. I went to Mr. Witten, at the Tower of London, and he also agreed to be one of the four. Now I had to look for a place to preach in, and, after seeking awhile, I hired a one-pair-of-stairs room at eighteenpence a week The local preachers in London generally breakfasted together every Sunday morning, and Mr. Phillips attended there also. He laid the state of the people of Woolwich before them, and they were of opinion a trial should be made. Soon after this Woolwich was put into the London circuit plan. I think this was in the month of June, 1788. In the September following Mr. Phillips said to me that he thought, if a chapel could be built, some good might be done. He proposed this to Mr. J. Wesley, and he did not object Soon after this Mr. Phillips went to a builder aud agreed with him to build a chapel, and then he came to me to get a piece of ground to build it on. We sought to get a piece in the middle of the Rope Ground, but found that no lease could be given, the estate being in Chan cery. We next applied to Mr. Everit, and took a piece in the brickfield joining to the New Road. Mr. Phillips with a bricklayer, on the 18th of October, 1788, and we, staked out the ground for the foundation of the chapel that day, and then com menced building it, and it was opened on the 29th of October, 1789, by Mr. John Phillips. The service began at half-past ten in the morning, half-past two in the afternoon, and six o'clock in the evening. * Enon Chapel, High Street. t Pensioner. N"], [308, "190 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. The manuscript is unsigned, but it bears on the face of it the unmis takable hand of one who was closely identified with the work which he so lovingly describes. This was Mr. Thomas Murrell, whose tombstone, recently restored, is to be seen in the little graveyard on the northern side of the chapel in William Street. It informs us that \" he was the founder of the Methodist Society in Woolwich,\" and that he died on January 30, 1837. Religion in the Army. \u2014 From a little book entitled, \" Experi mental and Practical Piety, or Memorials of Sergeant Rudd, Royal Artillery,\" by the Rev. R. Sargent, Woolwich, 1861,\" I extract a few further details, from which we may gather some idea of religion in the army during the earlier half of the present century, as well as infor mation specially affecting the Wesleyan community. Sergeant Rudd was born at Arklow, in Ireland, on April 6, 1777, and was devoutly brought up in the principles of the Church of England. He enlisted in the Royal Artillery in 1801, and came to Woolwich, where he feU into evil ways, until one Sunday evening, being in a public-house near the old church at Plumstead, he heard the sound of singing, which reminded him of home and his old convictions. He at once left the company, vowing to be faithful for the rest of his life. In a per- sonal narrative he says : \u2014 \" One evening, crossing over the barrack field, very solitary and unhappy, I was spoken to by a friend, to whom I opened my mind. He invited me to accompany him into Hanging Wood for prayer. In this wood was an old hollow tree, to which two or three godly soldiers used to retire for prayer and religious conversation. There they could possess and enjoy a place of retirement for social worship such as the barrack-room did not afford, and there they repaired every night. On one of these occasions the power of faith came down upon me.\" Sergeant Rudd joined the Wesleyan Church in 1804, when the society was small, and worshipped in the wooden chapel in Meeting-house Lane. The \" Old Chapel\" in the New Road, in which the society had worshipped, was mortgaged to \" a Mr. Weaver, \" who with others joined the Kilhamite division, and took with them the right of occupying the chapel with their own nnnisters. The Wesleyans worship- ping in Meeting-house Lane were, however, though few, united and devoted. \" The artillery soldiers now began to attend our Uttle chapel,\" says Sergeant Rudd, and he was appointed leader in 1806, with special reference to the converted soldiers, in which employment he continued for forty-seven years. About 1810, the congregation at Mr. Weaver's chapel having fallen away, he sold it to the \" Old Body,\" who now left Meeting-house Lane and took possession again of the chapel in New Road, and many young recruits became by the help of Sergeant Rudd steady and useful Christian soldiers in the Peninsular war. He states: \u2014 \" We commenced additional prayer meetings at six o'clock every morning, which became well attended by the soldiers, and every meeting became more interesting. In 1813 our chapel was so crowded that it was impossible to seat even the mem- bers of the society, now increased to nearly four hundred. At this time I was the society steward, and as we belonged to the City Road circuit I had much pleasure in reporting to the friends the great work that was going on at Woolwich. The preachers, Messrs. Clark, Griffith, Benson, Rankin, and Rodda, visited Woolwich every fortnight, and the work continued so to spread both amongst soldiers and civilians that the"], [309, "191 WOOLWICH. friends judged the time had arrived when they ought to have a much larger chapel. Hence the present beautiful and commodious house of God, which was erected in the year 1816.\" Sergeant Rudd was not permitted to go on without considerable opposition and serious danger to his temporal interests. Those in command at the barracks sought to thwart him in every possible way. More than once he was threatened to be sent abroad. Bibles and religious books were, if not literally prohibited, rarely to be met with amongst soldiers, and he hung behind the guard-room door a card, upon which was written that any of the men wishing for the loan ofa Bible or interesting book on religious subjects could have it by applying to himself. The captain of the day observed the card, and in great anger took it to the commandant of the garrison. Sergeant Rudd was sent for, severely reprimanded, and significantly informed that a station abroad would be a very suitable place for him. But Captain Maitland, an officer of a different spirit, hearing of the facts, directed that a copy of the Scriptures should be placed in every guard-room, which was also reported to the commandant, who passed a censure upon the captain. Captain Maitland then communicated with his father, who held a high commission. His father communicated with still higher authority, and the result was that a waggon-load of Bibles was sent down to Woolwich barracks for the guard-rooms and sick-wards of the hospitals. This, with concurrent circumstances, led to the regulation still in existence that every soldier's kit shall be supplied with a copy of the Bible. From an acorn springs a forest. In a letter dated June, 1828, Sergeant Rudd says that prayer meet ings would frequently continue five or six hours, until one, two, or three o'clock in the morning. At these meetings perhaps twenty persons would pray, and many twice over, and the exertion, combined with his labours as a clerk in the Adjutant-General's office, seriously impaired his health. He continued, however, active in the work for many year-; after, and died January 17, 1861, in the 85th year of his age. Welsh Chapel. \u2014 The Welsh Methodists have had a small chapel on Parson's Hill for about eighty years. It did not exist in 1806, in which year \" The Beauties of England and Wales\" records: \u2014 \" There are in Woolwich six meeting houses, one for Presbyterians, two for Anabap tists, two for the disciples of Mr. Whitfield,* and one for those of Mr. Wesley.\" Neither the Welsh Chapel, Carmel Chapel (New Road), Zion Chapel (Upper Market Street), Union Chapel (Sun Street), Bethlehem Chapel (Charles Street), nor any other chapel in Woolwich, had then come into existence. * Counting that in Plumstead Road, which seems to have been closed. N2"], [310, "192 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. But in 1812 the obituary notice appears of the Rev. David Morgan, minister of the Welsh Chapel at Deptford and Woolwich, and formerly of Swansea, who died October 31. The Welsh chapel has had but a feeble life, owing to the sparseness ofthe Welsh people at Woolwich, and in 1852 the following notice was posted on its doors : \u2014 \" This Chappell Too Lett. Enquire of Sun Alley, Daniel Lewis, near her Pump.\" Bethlehem Chapel. \u2014 There are few records of a remarkable nature connected with the smaller places of worship. Some have ceased to exist, like Bethlehem Chapel, which, after being some time closed, has during the last few years been converted to the uses of the \" Woolwich Chess Club.\" In repairing the floor, as already mentioned, some skeleton forms were discovered, but not removed, the remains of those who were buried under the church fifty years before ; and a stone tablet which stood behind the pulpit recorded the long and faithful services of Mr. Burnett, the zealous pastor of Bethlehem, and the worthy ancestor of a well known Charlton family. Zion Chapel. \u2014 The Bible Christians, another branch of the Wesleyan Connexion, for many years found a footing at Zion Chapel,* in Upper Market Street, but in 1886 they migrated to a superior temple in Herbert Road, Plumstead. Union Chapel. \u2014 Union Independent Chapel, in Sun Street, originated with the Roman Catholics in 1815. The ground upon which it stands was taken on lease for ninety-four years, commencing January 1, 1816, at \u00a316 per annum, from John Long by Tobias Conway. The Roman Catholics soon removing to New Road, an agreement was entered into by Mr. James Downes with Mr. Conway on August 1, 1818, to take the building and ground on lease at \u00a366 per annum, with the option of purchasing the chapel for \u00a31,000. The building was altered and fitted up and opened in October, 1818, and, as some of the principal persons in the congregation were Churchmen, the prayers of the Church of England were used. A minister was sought in the connection of the Countess of Huntingdon, and the Rev. Thomas Sharp, M.A., was chosen in 1819. He laboured with success until July, 1833, when he became minister of Crown Street Chapel, Westminster. Mr. Sharp during his ministry of fourteen years resided in Brewer Street, next the Wesleyan chapel, where he kept a first-class school for boys.\")\" Church prayers were discontinued at Union Chapel during the latter part of his ministry, and never resumed. * Now a school. t The iron frame which supported the school bell remained in situ until a few years since. The school occupied two houses."], [311, "WOOLWICH. 193 The Rev. George Neeton, of Dursley, succeeded Mr. Sharp on July 9, 1834, but resigned in July, 1836, and went to Norwich. The Rev. H. Jenkins came next, February 22, 1837, but he also resigned in the autumn of 1840 to settle at Chelsea, and the congregation began to languish. It was at this juncture that negotiations were opened for an alliance with Providence (afterwards Carmel) Chapel in New Road, the lease of which was nearly out, and under the pastorate of the Rev. W. Woodlands. The chapel was repewed and reopened under the name of \" Union \" Chapel, March 5, 1841. On the retirement of Mr. Wood lands he was succeeded by the Rev. R. B. Isaacs, who was followed by the Rev. John Richards, at the close of whose ministry the trustees handed the church over for the remnant of the lease to the Primitive Methodists, and they are still in occupation. The Primitive Methodists and Bible Christians will be historically treated under the head of Plumstead. Beresford Street Chapel. \u2014 Beresford Street Chapel was built in 1840 for \" the Wesleyan Association,\"* an offspring of the Wesleyan chapel in William Street, the trustees and leading spirits being Messrs. Johnson, Ph\u0153nix, Featherstone, Hiskins, and Truin. Joseph Street Chapel, \u2014 A few years afterwards Joseph Street Chapel was erected for the same body of Christians, and conducted by the same leaders. This chapel has recently become a Baptist place. There have been many other movements of a religious character set on foot by various sects and independent bodies, and the public halls have oeen many times used for more or less ambitious efforts to found new congregations. Chanting in Chapel. \u2014 I may note that the practice of chanting now adopted by various nonconformist bodies appears to have been introduced into Woolwich at a service held at the Lecture Hall, Nelson Street, on Sunday, January 6, 1856, under the leadership of the Rev. John Cox, formerly minister of Queen Street Baptist Chapel. The canticles sung were, \"0 come, let us sing\" (Psalm xcv.) and \"God be merciful\" (Psalm lxvii.). The Roman Catholics. \u2014 The Roman Catholic community at Wool wich was not numerous at the beginning of the present century, and its chronicles are likewise few. According to the annals of the Church there appears to have been a chapel or place of meeting in or near St. Mary Street, and unimpeachable authority points to the chapel in Sun Street, but prior to 1815 the Catholics had no place of worship nearer than Greenwich. * The chapel bears the name of \" The United Methodist Free Church.\""], [312, "194 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. About 1817, when the Wesleyans had quitted their old meeting house in New Road, the Roman Catholics took the building and con verted it into their church,* in which they worshipped until 1843. The Government gave, both to them and to the Presbyterians, sites of ground adjacent in New Road in 1842, and the Catholic journal, Orthodox, had the following announcement on September 24th of that year : \u2014 St. Peter's Catholic Church, Woolwich. \u2014 We have the happiness to inform our readers that the erection of this sacred edifice will soon commence. The intended church will be worthy of its designer, Mr. Pugin. The CathoUc population at Wool wich numbers 3,000 souls, and the present dilapidated chapel wiU not admit more than 400. On Sunday evening, the 2nd of next month, a meeting will be held at the Duchess of Wellingtons Green's End, Woolwich, and a collection made. The first priests at Woolwich were the Rev. Mr. Staples and the Rev. Mr. Nightingale. The latter, I believe, was accustomed to walk down from London for Sunday services fasting, and he would walk back to London again. This, of course, was long before railways. The Rev. Mr. Cole \u2014 \" Father Cole \" he was universally called \u2014 came next, and he held the charge for about eighteen years. The Rev. J. Cotter succeeded Father Cole in October, 1858. The schools adjoining were built upon the site of the old \"Gun\" Tavern, which stood between the Catholic and the Scotch Church until 1854, when it was purchased by the Government and the ground given for its present purpose. The trade of the \" Gun \" was then transferred to another house, erected on part of the site of the old Carmel (formerly Providence) Chapel, some sixty yards north. * See Plate XII., page 66. t lt was the common practice for the priests and people to meet after service on Sundays at the house of Mr. O'Dwyer, the Duchess of Wellington tavern, and discuss the affairs of the church.

Of these the martial muster-roll engrosses the most heroic, as, for especial instance, the immortal Gordon, whose brief memoir appears elsewhere. But it must also be allowed that the native genius of the place has gained victories other than of war. Beyond those whose deeds will be recounted in these pages, there are unquestionably some who by intellectual rank alone call for particular pedestals in our gallery of fame. The first in all grades of precedence, Richard Lovelace, distinguished both with pen and sword, was born at Woolwich in 1618, the fifteenth year of James I., and the year in which bold Raleigh lost his head. His father, Sir William Lovelace,* had an estate and residence here, but it seems impossible at present to determine its precise locality. Sir William, I find, was baptized at Canterbury Cathedral in 1583. He was knighted by James I. in 1609. He married Anne, sister of Sir WiUiam Barne (or Barnes) of Woolwich. t His illustrious son, Richard * The Lovelaces resided at Woolwich for several generations, and are mentioned in the records on various occasions. t Sir William Barnes, and others of his family, are also frequently named."], [314, "196 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Lovelace, is said to have been the most handsome, most accomplished, and bravest of all the noble spirits that shone during the unhappy reign of Charles I., and, like many more, he wasted his fortune and ruined his life in the service of that ill-fated king. His biographer has lavished upon him unmeasured praise, but several other writers of the period are fully as complimentary. The following story of Lovelace's life is extracted from Wood's account : \u2014 Richard Lovelace, the eldest son of Sir WiUiam Lovelace, of Woollidge, in Kent, Knight, was born in that county in 1618, educated in grammar learning in Charter house School, near London, became a gent, commoner of Gloucester Hall* in the beginning of 1634, and in his sixteenth year, being then accounted the most amiable and beautiful person that ever eye beheld ; a person also of innate modesty, virtue, and courtly deportment, which made him then, but especially after, when he retired to the great city, much admired and adored by the female sex. In 1636, when the King and Queen were for some days entertained at Oxon, he was, at the request of a great lady belonging to the Queen, actually created Master of Arts, though but of two years' standing, at which time his conversation being made pubUc, and thereby his ingenuity and generous soul discovered, he became as much admired by the male as before by the female sex. Lovelace subsequently turned soldier, and fought in the Scotch ex pedition of 1639, after which he retired to his estate at Bethersden, near Canterbury, which brought him an income of \u00a3500 a year. About this time, being on the commission of the peace, he was selected at the County Assize to deliver to the House of Commons the famous Kentish petition for the restoration of the King's rights and for settling the government. For this service he was on April 30, 1642, committed to the Gatehouse gaol at Westminster, and while a prisoner there he wrote his immortal song, \" To Althea.\" When love with unconfined wings Hovers within my gates, And my divine Althea brings To whisper at the grates ; When I Ue tangled in her hair And fetter'd to her eye, The birds that wanton in the air Know no such liberty. When flowing cups run swiftly round With no allaying Thames, Our careless heads with roses bound, Our hearts with loyal flames ; When thirsty grief in wine we steep, When health and draughts go free, Fishes that tipple in the deep Know no such liberty. * He matriculated at Gloucester Hall, June 27, 1634, as \" fihus Gul.

Stone waUs do not a prison make, Nor iron bars a cage ; Minds innocent and quiet take That for an hermitage. If I have freedom for my love And in my soul am free, Angels alone that soar above Enjoy such liberty. After a few months' incarceration Lovelace was released on heavy bail, and was forbidden to leave London, where it is too sure that he lived beyond his income and was too generous, not only in the King's cause, but in the entertainment of his friends. His brothers too he assisted, and as, like himself, they were soldiers, they were greatly in need of means to support the troops of an impoverished State. In 1646 he formed a regiment for the service of the French king and was its colonel, but was wounded at Dunkirk, and coming home, in 1648, with his brother Dudley, then a captain under him, they were both imprisoned in the Peter-house, London. It was in this durance that he framed the poems afterwards published with the title of \" Lucastra,\" which was the fanciful name of Lucy Sacheverell, a lady of beauty and fortune of whom he was enamoured, and to whom he wrote, when going to the wars, the well-known lines \u2014 Tell me not, sweet, I am unkind, That from the nunnerie Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind To wars and arms I fly. True, a new mistress now I chase, The first foe in the field ; And with a stronger faith embrace A sword, a horse, a shield. Yet this inconstancy is such As you too shall adore ; I could not love thee, dear, so much Lov'd I not honour more. Lucy Sacheverell, however, was inconstant too, for, hearing that he had died of his wounds at Dunkirk, she hastily married another wooer, and Lovelace appears to have been much affected by her fickleness. After the execution of Charles he was set at liberty, but, although still young, his life was waning. He had consumed his estate, and, as his health declined, he became melancholy, ragged, and miserable, lodging in obscure and dirty places, and hiding himself and his sorrows even from the charity of his former friends. He died in a very mean lodging in Gunpowder Alley, near Shoe Lane, and was buried amongst his kins-"], [319, "199 WOOLWICH. men in St. Bride's Church in 1658, having lived barely forty years. It is believed that he married his \" Althea \" after Lucastra's desertion, and that his daughter Margaret subsequently married Henry Coke, son of the Chief Justice, and ancestor to the Earls of Leicester. His brothers, Francis, Thomas, and Dudley, all partook in some degree of his poetic fire. Colonel Francis Lovelace wrote some congratulatory verses on the pub lication ofthe \" Lucastra,\" in which he describes Richard as his \" best brother : \" \u2014 So, my best brother, if unto your name I offer up a thin, blue-burning flame, Pardon my love, since none can make thee shine LTnless they kindle first their torch at thine. Thomas Lovelace, another brother, wrote an elegy, \" On my brother,\" with less guarded extravagance : \u2014 Lovelace is dead ! then let the world return To its first chaos, muffled in its urn The stars and elements together lie Drench'd in perpetual obscurity, And the whole machine in confusion be As immethodic as an anarchy. The youngest of his brothers (Dudley Wallace) also wrote an epitaph in more modest strain, and has left several other of his literary efforts, one of which, addressed \" To my dear brother, Colonel Bichard Love lace,\" is as follows : \u2014 I'll do my nothing too, and tr}' To dabble to thy memory. Not that I offer to thy name Encomiums of thy lasting fame. Those by the landed have been writ : Mine's but a younger-brother wit.

His friend Cotton wrote of him \u2014 His youth an abstract of the world's best parts, Inured to arms and exercised in arts ; Good as the best in both, and great ; but yet No dangerous courage nor offensive wit.

The Poets Of Nightingale Vale. \u2014 William Wordsworth the poet dwelt for awhile in Nightingale Vale, Woolwich, just by the boundary line which divides Woolwich and Plumstead. The house in which he resided is now No. 3, Nightingale Place, and stands facing Brook Hill Road, looking north. The adjoining houses, opposite the Lord Clyde, have been rebuilt, but this remains undisturbed, the easternmost of the old buildings. A gentleman named Quillinan occupied the house, and was the poet's intimate friend, and after wards his son-in-law. Wordsworth and Quillinan. \u2014 Sir Edward Perrott, Bart., to whom I am indebted for much in formation on manifold subjects, was invited by his neighbour Quillinan to meet Wordsworth, who had ad mired the beautiful grounds of Wordsworth. Brook Hill Park, and was enraptured with the nightingales \" and the full choir which woke the leafy groves.\" The nightingales occasionally visit the spot still, and have left it a name which will have sweet associations while the name survives. Edward Quillinan was himself no mean poet, as his published works testify. The nightingale enchanted him also, and thus in one of his poems he apostrophises melodious Philomel : \u2014 But hush, poor bird, thy clamorous suit, And thou, whom day offends, be mute ! For hark, the vernal notes awake From yonder lone neglected brake. Dear, musical, enthusiast, haU ! Unmatched, poetic, Nightingale. And in a note he says \u2014 I wish to take the opportunity in good time of preventing the charge, which may otherwise be brought against me, of having stolen from a golden treasury, and unskU fuUy aUoyed and debased the coin by converting Mr. Wordsworth's description of the Nightingale to my own use. This has been long written and printed, and it was only very recently that I saw Mr. Wordsworth's beautiful verses on the Nightingale for the first time. Wordsworth's style was, however, quite distinct : \u2014 And hark, the Nightingale begins its song, \" Most musical, most melancholy \" bird ! A melancholy bird . 0 idle thought ; In nature there is nothing melancholy . * * * *"], [322, "202 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. So many Nightingales : and far and near, In wood and thicket over the wide grove They answer, and provoke each other's songs With skirmish and capricious passagings ; And murmurs musical and swift jug-jug, And one low-piping sound more sweet than all. Quillinan was originally an officer of the 3rd Dragoons, but he was always warmly attached to literature, and his propensity for writing got him into some trouble, including two or three duels with brother officers. He served in the war with France, and on its conclusion, in 1816, he made the acquaintance of a mutual spirit, Sir Egerton Bridges, of Graves of the Wordsworth Family in Grassmere Churchyard. Denton Court, Kent, whose daughter Jemima he married. Quillinan's second daughter, Rotha, had Wordsworth for her godfather, as his well known sonnet testifies : \u2014 Rotha, my spiritual child, this head was grey When at the sacred font for thee I stood ; Pledged till thou reach the verge of womanhood, And shalt become thine own sufficient stay ; Too late, I feel, sweet orphan, was the day For steadfast hope that contract to fulfil ; Yet shall my blessing hover o'er thee still, Embodied in the music of this lay, Breathed forth beside the peaceful mountain stream,* The River Rotha, which flows into Windermere."], [323, "203 WOOLAVICH. Whose murmur soothed thy languid mother's ear Alter her throes ; this stream of name more dear Since thou doth bear it\u2014 a memorial theme For others ; for thy suture self, a spell To summon fancies out of Time's dark cell. Quillinan's young wife was burnt to death by her clothes catching fire in 1822, and the sad event cast a gloom over his life. Nineteen years elapsed, during the later part of which time he lived at Woolwich,* and then he married Wordsworth's daughter Dora,f doomed, alas, to lose her also by death after a short six years. This was in 1841, and ten more years covered the duration of his second loneliness. He died in Westmoreland on July 12th, 1851, aged sixty years. Words worth died in 1849, aged eighty. Robert Bloomfield. \u2014 Robert Bloomfield, poet, also spent some of his most restful and happy days at Woolwich, and is believed to have resided in the vicinity of Nightingale Vale. He married a Woolwich girl, as we may find frotr the preface to an edition of his poems published in 1809, which was during his lifetime. In this is quoted a letter from his Robert Bluonijield. brother George, showing that not only Robert, but one of his brother found a wife here : \u2014 * Sir Edward Perrott thought it was in 1835 that he met Wordsworth. Speaking of Rotha QuUlinan he says : \" You revive my memory about the pretty fair-haired rather ruddy girl. She and her sister w*ere elegant and cordial in manners. They did not mix with the military of that date, but wished to live retired, and I was the more gratified that they liked to roam about the Roughs and some parts of our grounds, from whence you could see down the Thames.\" t To whom in her childhood Wordsworth wrote his poem on the longest day. commencing \u2014 \" Dora, sport as now thou sportest On this platform light and free ; Take thy bliss while longest, shoitest Are indifferent to thee.\" To whom also he wrote that address \u2014 \" Hast thou then survived, Meek offspring of infirm humanity ! In that Being's sight From whom the Race of human-kind proceed, A thousand years are but as yesterday.\""], [324, "204 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. As my brother Nat had married a Woolwich woman it happened that Robert took a fancy to Mary Anne Church, a young woman of that town, whose father is a boat-buUder in the Government yard there. He married 12th December, 1790. Soon after he married Robert told me he had sold his fiddle and got a wtfe. Like most poor men, he got a wife first and had to get household stuff afterward.\" Bloomfield, as we know, suffered much from ill health, and in a note to his poem on Shooters' Hill, he says : \u2014 Sickness may be often an incentive to poetical composition ; I found it so ; and I esteem the following Unes only because they remind me of past feelings which I would not willingly forget. SHOOTERS' HILL. To hide me from the public eye, To keep the throne of reason clear, Amidst fresh air to breathe or die, I took my staff and wandered here ; Suppressing every sigh that heaves And coveting no wealth but thee, I nestle in the honied leaves And hug my stolen Uberty.

The following verses are omitted from most of the published collec tions of Bloomfield's works; hut, although they may be inferior in literary character to other of his writings, they are especially welcome to us as evidencing the poet's close familiarity with our locality and its affairs, and at the same time helping to illuminate our historical records.

One of his biographers says of him \u2014 A sweeter kindlier soul never laid down the burden of an unequal strife. Richard Ruegg. \u2014 Mr. Ruegg, who also resided in Nightingale Vale, was the author of many fugitive poems, most of which appeared in the columns of the Kentish Independent. It has been said that his intellect should have been given entirety to literary work instead of being spent upon sanitary science, but no mind can be degraded by devotion to those pursuits which give health and happiness to the people. The following verses on \" The Maids of Kent \" were among his early productions : \u2014 The maids of Kent, the maids of Kent \u2014 The pencU hath no art To shadow forth in all their grace These idols of the heart !

Cobbett, who attacked Paine under the nom de plume of \"Peter Porcupine,\" changed bis mind and apologised after Paine's death. Paine died June 8th, 1809, aged seventy-two years. William Cobbett was born at Farnham, in Surrey, in 1762. He enlisted at Chatham in a line regiment in 1784, and a year later went to Nova Scotia, where he remained until 1791. He there saw his future wife, who was then but thirteen years of age, while he was twenty one. She was the daughter of a sergeant-major of ar tillery, and he a sergeant major of a regiment of foot. Her beauty and industry combined to draw him to wards her. Early one morn ing he saw her out on the snow scrubbing a tub, and exclaimed, \" That's the girl William Cobbett. for me.\" He never repented his choice. Six months after their first meeting the battery of artillery was sent home to Woolwich, and his sweetheart went with her father, but Cobbett gave her all his savings \u2014 \u00a3150 \u2014 and told her to make use of it as her own. Two years after he came home, and, repairing at once to Woolwich, found his girl in the situation of servant to Captain Brisac at \u00a35 a year, but she put into his hands the whole of the \u00a3150. The register of Woolwich Church records their marriage on the 5th of February, 1792.

An incident of his life, which I have seen narrated in his biographies, was his appear ance as a witness at Staffordshire Assizes to prove an alibi for a man charged with murder, whose ac quittal he secured by showing that on the day of the murder he, Grimaldi, played at Woolwich, and saw the accused there.* Joe Grimaldi Tom Hood the elder wrote an ode on Grimaldi, and probably had \" Prospect Row \" in his mind when he penned this verse : \u2014 Joseph, thou hast left the stage, To toddle down the hill of life, And taste the flannell'd ease of age Apart from pantomimic strife ; Retired \u2014 (for Young would have it so) \u2014 The world shut out \" \u2014 in Pleasant Row.

His acquaintance with the organ and with church music was so remarkable, even at that period, that it led to his appointment as organist and director of the choir at the church of North Cray, in Kent ; and while holding that office he wrote chants and * The date was March 13th, 1807. t The house still stands behind the theatre"], [330, "210 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. anthems which would have done no discredit to composers of repute. He continued to study the theory of music under a well-known master, and took lessons on the pianoforte from the celebrated John Cramer. He was next placed under the care of a distinguished professor of singing, and from that moment the other branches of his musical education were generally abandoned. The bent of his mind was evidently towards dramatic singing, and after a long course of assiduous study he made his first appearance ou the stage ofthe theatre at Newcastle. This was in 1839, when he wa*~ in his nineteenth year, and had duly cultivated what was then considered a barytone voice.\" Sims Reeves made (I believe) his first public appearance at a sacred concert given by Mr. McKenzie, the Royal Artillery bandmaster, at Woolwich in 1834. A book of words used on that occasion is in my possession. It was printed by E. Jones, Thomas Street (afterwards Kentish Independent office), and is entitled \" Selection of Sacred Music to be performed at the Royal Artillery Chapel, Woolwich, on Tuesday, 23rd December, 1834.\" A list of the choir is given, in which will be found many well-re membered names in com pany with those of young Reeves and his father : \u2014 Treble. \u2014 Masters Wells, Reeves, jun., Wilkinson, jun., J.

Mr. Ludwig Siedle, their father, kept a jeweller's shop at 17, Thomas Street, Woolwich, and it is a remarkable fact that this same house was formerly occupied by Mr. McKenzie, the Royal Artillery bandmaster just mentioned, and that here Sims Reeves came to take lessens of him. On November 3, 1886, I had the pleasure of seeing and hearing Sims Reeves and the two Siedles (Phillipine and Mrs. Lennox) associated together in the three leading parts of the Beggars' Opera at the Avenue Theatre. Another strange coincidence is this : Sims Reeves, the Siedles, and Frederick Leslie, not to mention a host of other actors, all gained their earliest fame in the same build ing ; for the Garrison Theatre, be it remembered, was formerly the Garrison Church, in which Reeves sang as a boy under his father's tuition. Miss Phillipine Siedle has been constantly associated with Mr. Sims Reeves in his later concerts and dramatic performances. Her portrait appears on Plate H, page 197. Fred. Leslie. \u2014 Mr. Frederick Leslie was born on April 1, 1855, at 49, Artillery Place, Woolwich, where his father founded a well known and extensive trade of military outfitting, since removed to London. Our successful young actor has been the subject of many published biographical notices, and I choose one of these in preference to recording, under the influence of a close personal friendship, my own impressions. I select the following from a theatrical journal, Under the Clock, in which it appeared on December 13, 1884 : \u2014 Mr. Frederick Leslie commenced his dramatic career at the precocious age of eight. He had long occupied himself with the construction of paper scenery and puppet, actors, and at length an opportunity occurred for making a debut upon real boards. It came about in this way : a wooden fence which divided his father's garden from some adjoining premises happened to be leveUed, and it occurred to some stage struck companions and himself that a real theatre might be built from the planks which lay about temptingly idle. Some gas-pipes were obtained as a support for the stage, which had, however, to be chalked in parts where dangerous to tread, and the place was roofed roughly in after the manner of fair-booths which the youthful archi tects had somewhere seen. Young Leslie set himself dUigently to work to write the play, all the characters being played by boys. This first effort of the juvenile play wright has not been preserved, but its name was Walker's Ruin, the said Walker being murdered in the first act, much to his disappointment, and under strong protest, as he was naturally ambitious to keep himself as a leading character well before the pubUc till the fall of the curtain. The boys had expended all their pocket-money in preparations for the forthcoming piece, and, at the last moment, it was discovered that they had no lights, when they conceived the brilliant idea of making a charge ol one farthing for admission to the show. As the money flowed into the treasury it was at once expended in candles, till at length, as the theatre became full, it presented a blaze of splendour. Mr. Leslie was destined for the profession of an architect, but"], [334, "212 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. it was little to his taste, and when quite a youth in his teens he was playing as an amateur, and before he was twenty had undertaken leading Shakespearian parts. His first engagement in the great regular army of which he had long been an enthu siastic volunteer was at the Royalty under Kate Santley's management. He presented himself as an impersonator of old men's parts, and is firmly convinced that a thick stick which he carried, and thumped vigorously upon the ground while he read the part of Colonel Hardy in Paul Pry before the manageress, secured him his first en gagement. When asked what salary he wanted, he modestly mentioned a pound a week, subsequently raised to two pounds, to which an extra five shilUngs was afterwards added as an appropriate remuneration for ' a voice ' of which he was dis covered to be the fortunate possessor. Mr. Leslie next obtained a two years' engage ment, which included a provincial tour under Madame Dolaro, at the Folly, now Toole's Theatre, for a season of comic opera. From thence he migrated to the Alhambra, where, sure sign of a rising actor's success, he doubled his salary in twelve months . Here he played with a great success Due della Volta in La Wilh du Tambour Major, Faust in Herve's Mephistoplieles II. (Little Dr. Faust), Briolet in Jeanne, Jean * nette, and. Jeanneton, with other parts. He made next a tour through the States extending over eight months. Mr. Leslie has drifted rather than gone of set purpose into the Une of comic opera. It was only the accidental discovery that he possessed a voice which diverted him from the Shakespearian parts and the more serious drama, to that Ughter vein of opera created almost by composers Uke Offenbach, Suppe, and Strauss, and of w'hich after only six years from his debut he had become one of the best exponents on the English stage. Not but that very tempting opportunities have often presented themselves to induce him to return to his first histrionic love, Shake speare. When in the States, before the vision of beautiful Mary Anderson appeared on the Lyceum stage, Mr. LesUe was invited by her step-father and manager to play Romeo to her Juliet, when we should certainly have seen a Romeo of as noble a presence as any that have trod the London boards, and a fit mate to a Juliet of matchless beauty ; but the offer was decUned by Mr. Leslie. He is exceedingly popular both within and without the profession, and has been cordially recognised by the most, distinguished patrons of art. On a memorable occasion Mr. Irving paid him the high compliment of inviting him to be present at a supper which he gave to the Prince of Wales and a select few on the stage of the Lyceum. During his first visit to America, Mr. Leslie was cabled to by M. Marius to appear at the opening of the new Avenue Theatre, as the Marquis de Ponsable in a revival of Madame Favart ; and he also appeared here in Les Manteaux Noirs. In Rip van Winkle, at the Comedy, he had a run of over three hundred nights. A second visit to America followed, when he made a marked success in The Beggar Student, 'Madame Favart, and other pieces. Mr. Leslie possesses all the qualifications for success in the leading roles of comic opera \u2014 a handsome, manly face, a noble stage-figure, which lends itself admirably to the impersonation of the stage hero. He speaks his part with irre proachable purity of tone and accent. He is a thorough gentleman upon as weU as off the stage, and, added to all, he possesses a voice full of melody and power, and ho is never guilty either of the affectation of aiming at a style of singing appropriate to more serious opera, or of descending to the level of the music-hall stage. He is a man of cultivated tastes, of very varied accomplishments, a genial companion, and a capital raconteur, as well as a first-rate artist. While still under thirty, he has reached the very front rank of his profession. As the romantic hero of operetta, he stands without a rival on the English stage. In 1888 Mr. Leslie went on a tour through Australia and America with the Gaiety company at a salary of \u00a3100 per week, and received an invitation to return to the Antipodes at twice the figure."], [335, "213 WOOLWICH. Edward Terry. \u2014 The now famous Edward Terry fulfilled one of his first engagements at the Theatre in Beresford Street, Woolwich. He says : \u2014 The young actor has no such training school now as he had under the old order of things. Whatever success I have gained I largely attribute to the hard work I did as a member of a stock company, when I worked at the Woolwich Theatre nearly fourteen hours a day for eighteen shillings a week. Other Stars. \u2014 Of the many other living artists whose names are asso ciated with Woolwich we may mention Madame Amadi, better known by her professional name of Miss Annie Tremaine, but still more readily recognised here, her birthplace, as Miss Creelman. Mrs. Willard (nie Waters) was born and reared in St. Mary Street, and several well-known actors have old associations with the place, amongst them being Mr. Arthur Dacre (a surgeon and assistant to Dr. Butler of Woolwich Common) and Mr. Graham, who was Mr. Modlock, master of St. John's Schools. The last-named is now engaged chiefly in America, as is also Mr. Harry Morgan, another younger son of Wool wich, a rising star full of promise. The \"inimitable\" Mackney in his early days played the violin in the orchestra at Woolwich Theatre for a weekly salary of fifteen shillings.

Henry Maudslay (says Samuel Smiles, the author of \"Self Help,\" &c.) was born at Woolwich towards the end of the last century, in a house standing in the court at the back of the Salutation Inn, the entrance to which is nearly opposite the Arsenal gates. His father was a native of Lancashire, descended from an old family of the same name, the head of which resided at Mawdsley Hall, near Ormskirk, at the be- ginning of the seventeenth century. The family were afterwards scattered, and several of its members became workmen. WiUiam Maudslay, the father of Henry, belonged to the neighbourhood of Bolton, where he w*as brought up to the trade of a joiner. Having got into trouble in his neighbourhood through some alleged liaison, WilUam enlisted in the Royal Artillery, and the corps to which he belonged was shortly after sent out to the West Indies. He was several times engaged in battle, and in his last action he was hit by a musket-ball in the throat. The soldier's stock which he wore had a piece cut out of it by the ball, the direction of which was diverted ; and, though severely wounded, his Use was saved. He brought home the stock, and preserved it as a relic, afterwards leaving it to his son. Long after, the son would point to the stock, hung up agamst the wall, and say, \" But for lhat bit of leather there would have been no Henry Maudslay.\" The wounded artilleryman was invaUded and sent home to Woolwich, the head-quarters of his corps, where he was shortly after dis-"], [336, "214 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. charged. Being a handy workman he sought and obtained employment at the Arsenal. He was afterwards appointed a storekeeper in the Dockyard. It was during the former stage of William Maudslay's employment at Woolwich that the subject of this memoir was born in the house in the court above mentioned on the 22nd of August. 1771. The boy was early set to work. When twelve years old he was employed ac a \" powder monkey \" in making and filling cartridges. After two years he was passed on to the carpenters' shop where his father worked, and there he became acquainted with tools and the art ol working in wood and iron. From the first the latter seems to have had by far the greater charms for him. The blacksmiths' shop was close to the carpenters', and Harry seized every opportunity that offered of plying the hammer. the file, and the chisel, in preference to the saw and the plane. Many a cuff did the foreman of carpen ters give him for absenting himself from his proper shop and stealing off to the smithy. At the end of a year it was thought better to yield to his earnest desire, and he was re moved to the smithy in his fifteenth year. Hi? heart being now in his work, he made rapid pro gress, and soon became an expert smith. His skill was especially in surging light iron work, and a favourite job was making \"trivets'' out of the solid. which only the \" dab - hands \" of the shop could do. Birthplace of Henry Maudslay in Salutation Alley, Woolwich. but which he threw off with great rapidity in first-rate style. Even at the close of his life, when he had acquired eminent distinction as an inventor and was a large employer of skilled labour, he looked back with pride to the forging of his early days in Woolwich Arsenal. He used to describe with much gusto how the old experienced hands, with whom he was a great favourite, would crowd about him when forging his trivets, some of which may to this day be in use among Woolwich housewives for supporting the toastplate before the bright fire. This, however, was entirely contraband work, done \" on the sly,\" and strictly prohibited by the superintending officer, who used kindly to signal his approach by blowing his nose in a peculiar manner, so that all forbidden jobs might be put out of the way The manual skill of the young blacksmith gave him considerable reputation, and he was spoken of in the London shops as one of"], [337, "215 WOOLWICH. the most dexterous hands in the trade. It was this circumstance that shortly led to his removal from Woolwich Arsenal. Joseph Bramah took out the first patent for hi. lock in 1784, and consulted an old German artizan in Whitechapel, reckoned one of the most ingenious workmen in London, with [the object of securing precise work manship in lock-making. But they could not solve the problem, and Bramah began to fear that his lock would become a mechanical curiosity, when one of the German's fellow-workmen ventured to suggest that there was a young man in Woolwich Arsenal named Maudslay, who was so clever that \" nothing bet him.\" Maudslay was at once sent for, and appeared before the lockmaker \u2014 a tall, strong, comely young fellow, then only eighteen years of age. Bramah was almost ashamed to lay his case before such a mere youth, but necessity constrained him, and the replies were so modest, sensible, and practical, that Bramah adopted the youth's suggestions and offered to give him a job He soon took rank in Bramah's workshop, for his manual dexterity was the least of his gifts. He was not only the favourite, but the hero of the shop. Perhaps he owed something to his fine personal appearance, for on gala days it was \" Harry \" who marched at the head and carried the flag. His conduct as a son was as admi rable as his qualities as a workman. His father dying shortly after he went to London, he was accustomed to walk down to Woolwich every Saturday and hand over to his mother, for whom he had the tendersst regard, a considerable share of his week's wages, and this he continued to do as long as she lived Bramah admitted that to Maudslay's skill he owed in a great degree his success, but, even after making him manager of his works, he declined to advance his wages beyond 30s. a week, and Maudslay, having married and found the cares of a family, determined to start on his own account. He began in a small shop in Wells Street, Oxford Street, and success soon followed. His inventions were many, including the well-known \"slide rest,\" the influence of which upon machinery his pupil Nasmyth has likened to the influence ofthe steam-engine on manufactures and commerce. Maudslay soon became acquainted with the famous Brunei, and removed eventually to his great factory in the West minster Road, Lambeth. The rest of his wonderful career it is unnecessary to trace. He was the beau ideal of an honest, upright, straightforward, hardworking, and intel- ligent EngUshman. Maudslay's Tomh. \u2014 Henry Maudslay's death occurred from a cold on the Wth of February, 1831. By his direction he was buried in Woolwich Churchyard, where a cast-iron tomb made to his own design was erected over his remains. It stands on the summit of the north enclosure, where it can be seen from the public footpath. A Lover of Woolwich. \u2014 Maudslay had ever a warm heart for Woolwich, and he often returned to it to refresh himself with a sight of the scenes familiar to his boyhood. He liked its green common, Shooters' Hill, with its look-out over Kent and down the valley of the Thames, the river busy with shipping, and the royal craft loading and unloading their armaments at the wharves. He liked the clangour of the Arsenal smithy, where he had first learned his art, and all the busy industry of the place. It was natural therefore that, being proud of his early connection with Woolwich, he should wish to lie there ; and Woolwich on her part, let us add, has equal reason to he proud of Henry Maudslay."], [338, "216 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. To the foregoing facts I am enabled by the kindness of the present Mr. Henry Maudslay to add some further details respecting his famous grandfather and the Maudslay family. Our hero's father, William Maudslay, was a sergeant-wheelwright when in the Royal Artillery, and was married at Woolwich Church to Margaret Laundy in July, Henry Maudslay. (Photographed from an Oil Painting in possession of the Family.) 1763. They had seven children (all born in Woolwich), of whom Henry was the fifth ; he also by his wife had seven chil dren, the eldest, Thomas Henry, having seven likewise. Sergeant Maudslay was a member of the Union (now Union Waterloo) Lodge of Freemasons at Wool wich, and the present Henry Maudslay is a distinguished member of the Grand Lodge of England. Amongst the special inventions which made the fame of the Woolwich apprentice may be mentioned the cup leather for the hydraulic presses, and the first upright direct action steam-engine. He also obtained a reward of \u00a31,000 offered by the Government for a three-threaded screw required at the Royal Observatory. The heralds have traced the family back to remote times and high rank, the name having undergone some singular variations, and it is also probable that some of the branches have remained in Woolwich until this day, the Morsleys and the Moseleys, perhaps, being of them. There is a good deal in pedigree, and irrespective of his achievements Maudslay was a fine fellow, of commanding figure and with a splendid head, as this photograph which I have taken from the family portrait will show. But, after all, it is \u2014 Worth makes the man, and want of it the fellow, Tlie rest is all but leather or prunello.

Among these so creditable an authority as Lysons, in his \"Environs of London,\" has asserted that the ship was built at Erith, J and by contract ; while others, equally reliable, have declared, equally without proof, that the honour belongs to Woolwich. All the writers agree that the Henry Grace de-Dieu, afterwards known as the Great Harry, was commenced in the third year of Henry's reign, i.e., 1512, and it is remarkable that such a mighty controversy should have prevailed so long about her birthplace, seeing how simple a matter it would have been to refer to the official records at the Admiralty and settle the point.

A.D. 1512. \u2014 The foregoing extracts prove beyond question that the Great Harry was built at Woolwich, and by the Crown. This being so, it requires very little conjecture or argument to establish the fact that a dockyard must have existed at Woolwich in 1512, but it must be confessed that the fact is not distinctly stated in any of the records. This is the more vexatious as there is an entry of this same date (1512), showing that a new dock was then constructed at the opposition port of Erith, and a \"king's schipp \" named the Sorerin taken in for repairs. No one is likely to dispute, in the face of the foregoing documents, that Woolwich had a dockyard in 1512, and built therein the Great Harry, and we can at any rate bring direct testimony to establish the existence of the dock in 1514-15, by quoting from the navy accounts which appear under that date the following items : \u2014 \u00a3 s. d. The Sovereign. Costs of bringing her from Erith to Woolwich, and so into her dock, and the charge of much repair H 5 4 Paid by the king's command for the carting, cleansing, hedging, staking, and piUng of the dock at Woolwich for the bringing in the ship called the Sovereign .... 26 0 0 Costs of carriage, and felling of tynnet stakes and pUes, as well for the docks, as for shutting the head of the same . . . . .2142 Costs of certain labourers dispatching the ballast X out of the Sovereign, and helping to moor the Great Barbara at Woolwich . . . .290 Paid to labourers for the shutting in the Sovereign's dock head . . . 24 13 5 Felling timber, and other expenses in the Sovereign and her dock . .307 The following will go to prove that this dock was at this time a royal dock, and a permanent establishment : \u2014 A Note how many ships the King's Majesty hath in harbour on the 18th day of September, in the thfrteenth year of his reign (1521), what portage they be of, what state they be in the same day, also where they ride and be bestowed.

And Brygandyn,t the clerk of the ships, doth say, that before the said ship shall be laid in the dock, it is necessary that her mast be taken down, and bestowed in the great storehouse at Erith ; and also he saith, that if the Great Henry be not housed over, in such wise that the same may be sufficiently defended from snow, rain, and sun, it shall be utterly destroyed within few years, and also he esteemed that the charge to house it will amount to the sum of one hundred marks and above. The Sovereign, being of the portage of eight hundred tons, lyeth in a dock at Woolwich, the same being in such case that she must be new made from the keel upwards. Upon these evidences, then, it may safely be averred that a dock and building-yard existed at Woolwich as early at least as 1512, and there is no doubt that the first of the long line of leviathan ships which have established and maintained the naval supremacy of Britain was here brought into being. Record so early as this has no other royal dock or place where royal ships have been builded, and I hope it will not be thought wasted space to have printed here the proofs which are necessary to vindicate, in this particular, the credit of Woolwich. Early Days. \u2014 Once set on foot, the young dockyard had a vigorous growth. At first it seems to have consisted merely of the building slip, with a few temporary buildings for the workmen and officers, but, King Henry continued to build and repair his ships here, and to extend his premises. His Majesty bought a house and land, a meade, salt-house, and wharf at Woolwich in August, 1518, for \u00a3113 6s. 8d., and the same day he paid John Hopton \u00a3100 for repairing and caulking there the great galley Mary Rose, which was built here and afterwards sunk at Spithead.* Sir Edward Boughton. \u2014 In the thirty-seventh year of his reign, 1545, the King purchased two other parcels of land, called \" Bowfon's\" (or \" Boughton's\"), from Sir Edward Boughton, who had long been his confidential clerk and local agent at Woolwich and Plumstead, and was now lord of the manor of Southall, which practically made him owner of nearly the whole parish. Henry afterwards bought of Sir Edward two more parcels, called \"Sandhill\" and \"Our Lady Hill.\" All these sites were, I believe, within the present enclosure, and included in the earliest limits of the infant dockyard. The name of * This refers to the dock in which, according to the next paragraph, the ship Sovereign was then lying. t Whose name was given to vessels rigged according to his suggestion. + The Mary Rose was frequently at Woolwich. In 1579 we have the following entry : \" The White Bear new repayred in Wollidge dock to a charge of .\u00a3800. The Mary Roase new repayred in Woolch dock to a charge of \u00a3640. The storehouses at Woullwich new repayred.\""], [347, "223 WOOLWICH. \" Our Lady \" Hill has a significant relationship to that of St. Mary's Church, and was probably in close proximity. I fancy that it may have been part of the slope which we descend on the tramway from Coleman Street to Dock Rails, and the Sand Hill was either adjoining, or one of the ballast hills at the back of the town street.* It is not improbable that Bowton's docks may have been the original building yard itself, at first hired only and then purchased by the Crown. The payment of \u00a36 to Maryon Danyell t for the hire of her ground and houses, occupied by the King's timber and tbe Henry Grace-de-Dieu in 1512-15, helps this conjecture, for it is easy to suppose that Bough ton may have acquired the land, with the rest of his estates, in the interval. The Nucleus. \u2014 The first building-slip was probably on tbe spot occupied by the granite graving dock at the eastern end of the yard, and may originally have been a natural cleft in the land at the termi nation of the little valley which we find in St. Mary Street and Sun Street. It has been pointed out that at one time the hill on which the church stands sloped down to the water's edge. J And it would have formed the eastern side of the little estuary. There was only one building-slip for very many years. And not only are we sure that, while the Great Harry was a-build ing, Woolwich was one of the chief ports of the royal navy, but it is by no means certain that this was not the royal dockyard also during the preceding, if not several preceding, reigns. However, there are no positive proofs to offer in evidence, and the claim to priority being sufficiently established, it is not necessary to pursue the subject. After the Harry was launched, she seems to have been usually moored lower down the river, and on the 11th of August, 1515, when Henry VIII. had at Woolwich the Great Barbara, the Great Nicholas, and the John Baptist, he had in the broad reach of Erith, the Henry Grace-de-Dieu, the Trinity Sovereign, the Gabriel Royal, the Catherine Fortokza, the Catherine Galy, the Rose Galy ; % at Blackwall, the Mary Rose, the Peter Pome Grenade, and the Great Elizabeth ; and at Dept ford the Crist of Greenwich. Ancient Wages. \u2014 From an account rendered about the same time relative to the Great Nicholas while moored at Woolwich, we find that the carpenters and others employed upon her were paid from twopence * See Plate XX., page 145. t See note, page 220. X See Churchyard, page 158. \u00a7 Probably gaUeys, or rowing-boats. P 2"], [348, "224 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. to sixpence per day, and the sailors five shillings a month. The bill for victuals was as follows : \u2014 \u00a3 s. d. 282 doz. of bread 14 2 0 67 pipes of beer at 0 6 8 per pipe. 28 qrs. of beef at 0 4 2 per qr. 500 dry fish 2 7 8 per 100. 800 cades of herrings at 0 5 0 per cade. 6 barrels of white herrings 0 7 0 per barrel. Henry's navy accounts have also mentioned the \" great storehouse \" at Erith. This I make out to have been an old hulk afloat. It was pro posed in 1525, as it had been in 1521, to lay the masts of the Great Harry in the storehouse at Erith. End ofthe \" Great Harry.\"* \u2014 The Great Harry had alife of only thirty-eight years, and ended, as she had begun, her career at Woolwich. We read that \" the famous ship, being at Woolwich on the 27th of August, 1553, the first year of Queen Mary, by the carelessness of the mariners took fire, and was totally consumed.\" She was a magnificent vessel, but the drawings by which she is repre sented, one of which I produce, Plate XXIV., page 218, are of doubtful accuracy. Longfellow writes of her in his \" Building of the Ship \" \u2014 Above them all, strangest of all, Towered the Great Harry, crank and tall, Whose picture was hanging on the wall ; With bows and stern raised high in air, And balconies hanging here and there, And signal lanterns and flags afloat, And eight round towers, like those that frown From some old castle, looking down Upon the drawbridge and the moat. Early Vicissitudes. \u2014 Henry's passion for building big ships was not inherited by his children, and we hear little of Woolwich during the short reigns of either Edward VI. or Mary. Nor did the longer regime of Elizabeth and her vigorous foreign policy bring any per manent increase of employment to the town. Inconstant trade and fluctuating prosperity have been the features of the Government adop tion almost from the very beginning. Hasted tells us that in the reign of Elizabeth, as the business of the royal navy increased, \" new docks and launches \" were erected here ; hut the good queen had a frugal mind, and, although she knew how much of her strength lay in her navy, she was a trifle parsimonious with her fleet.

It is thus recorded : \u2014 The next day, July 3, the Queen went to Woolwich, to the launching of a fine ship newly built, and called by her own name, Elizabeth. The 10th of the same month, being stiU at Greenwich, there was made a place.in the park for the Queen's pensioners, who were to run with spears. The chaUengers were three \u2014 the Earl of Ormond, Sir John Perrot, and Mr. North.* There is no doubt, however, that the Queen was idolised by her people, whose loyalty, indeed, was of quite an extravagant order. The writers of^the day were accustomed to deal out unmeasured flattery of their sovereign lady, and the following verses written by Rowland on * I have given the second part of the paragraph because it contains a familiar local name."], [350, "226 RECORDS OP THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. the combined theme of the Queen and the Thames is a fair example of courtly language in the Elizabethan era : \u2014 \" 0 thou silver Thames, O clearest crystal flood, Beta alone the ph\u0153nix is of all thy watery brood. The queene of Virgines onely she, And thou the queene of floods shall be.

The Thames and Shooters' Hill. Drawn 1810. Mr. Peter Pett, the master shipwright, sent to the Queen in 1586 an estimate for new buildings and reparations required at the Wool wich storehouses, and at the same time reported that Her Majesty's navy generally was in a very bad state, most of the ships being old and out of repair, but all capable of being fitted out for sudden service. The Queen, it is well known, took a personal concern in such matters, and it is believed that in this yard she fitted, at least in part, the expe dition which in 1587 she sent out in charge of Sir Francis Drake to pillage and destroy the Spanish shipping.

At that time tbe English navy consisted of only forty ships ; but merchantmen pressed into the service from all the ports, and having gallant hearts within them, proved worthy auxiliaries of the regidar wooden walls of England. The Engagement with Sjianish Galleons. mighty fleet of Spaiu was utterly discomfited, and Drake was loaded with glory. But there were not wanting envious critics, who ascribed the failure of the Armada and the perservation of the country to a series of accidents and mistakes, and these evoked the following epi gram : \u2014 Oh, Nature, to old England still Continue these mistakes, Give us for all our kings such queens, And for our dux such Drakes.

It is ordered that the storehouse at Woolwich, being decayed, the arms be removed to the Tower, as they are subject to embezzlement and rust. Old Woolwich not Healthy. \u2014 Stowe, the early historian, writing in this same year (1598) says \u2014 \u2022 Woolwich is seated on the Kentish side, low and not over healthful, but, by reason of its dock and storehouses for the Navy Royal, is a place well inhabited, especially by those that have their dependence thereon. Sir Walter Raleigh. \u2014 That famous seaman and adventurer, the brave, the chivalrous, the courtly Raleigh, was intimately associated with Woolwich. It is be lieved that in this dockyard his ships were built and fitted for his expeditions to South America during the reign of Elizabeth ; and it is certain that, after his long confine ment in the Tower, his last ill-fated enterprise in 1618 was here, at least in part, prepared. Our master ship wright, Phineas Pett, in his diary, the MS. of which is still to be seen, says \u2014 About the 27th of March, 1615, I bargained with Sir Walter Raleigh to build him a ship of five hundred tons, which I procured leave from the Lord Admiral to buUd in the GaUey Dock at Woolwich towards which I presently received \u00a3500, Sir Walter Raleigh. to begin -with, and the 8th of April foUowing I set my men to work on her.

His * See Records of Royal Arsenal."], [353, "229 WOOLWICH. son was slain hy the Spaniards in Guinea, and on his return to England, King James, to mollify Spain, sent Sir Walter Raleigh to the block. East India Company. \u2014 Two years before Elizabeth's death the first expedition left for the East Indies, and laid the foundation of our vast and magnificent oriental empire. It consisted of three ships, and the records of the company state that they were fitted out at Woolwich, under Captain James Lancaster, and by virtue of a royal charter granted to the company of \" merchant adventurers.\" It was on the 15th of May, 1601, that the expedition was finally inspected and declared ready for its enterprise, and the three ships were the Dragon of 600 tons, the Swan of the like burthen, and the Guest, a victualler of 130 tons. The soldiers, sailors, and \" merchants \" numbered 550 men, and they took with them trading stock to tbe value of \u00a320,000.* This was the beginning of our magnificent Indian Empire. Woolwich under James I. \u2014 James I., who ascended the throne in 1603, did much during his remarkable reign of twenty-two years to advance tbe navy, and Woolwich undoubtedly7 made much progress. Indeed, in all its history the dockyard has experienced no years so eventful as those embraced within the earlier part of this monarchy. The gallant young Henry, Prince of Wales, the idol of the people, who was educated at Charlton, was never happier than when at Wool wich, and never so much at home as in its dockyard. His association with Phineas Pett, the skilful and enterprising master shipwright, had a salutary effect upon the art of naval architecture and the develop ment of this yard, and the many incidents of the period which are preserved to us by the diarists of the day are amongst tbe most inter esting of all the records in our collection. Royal Patronage. \u2014 We are at once struck with the system of state patronage which was at that time accepted as the natural order of things. In 1604 (as stated at page 50) there was a grant to Hugh Lyddiard (frequently spelt \"Lydiard\" or \"Lydyard\") of the office of Clerk of the Checque of the Navy and works at Woolwich, and Clerk of the Storehouse there, \"for life ; \" and two years later a grant \"in reversion \" to Jobn Jackson of the clerkship of the cheque at Wool wich, also \" for life.\" Jackson's chance seems to have been delayed until 1614, when John Ac worth was granted, \" for life,\" tbe second half of Lyddiard's office, the care of the storehouses. These royal favours were not peculiar to this monarch, for we may find that in the following reign (Charles I.), Henrick Edisbury, who was an officer of the yard at Chatham, writes to a friend at court to say that \u2014 * See Records of Rope Walk."], [354, "230 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT.

A GREAT STATE TRIAL AT WOOLWICH, James I. also many incidents and vicissitudes of his chequered life The Story of Phineas Pett. \u2014 The records of Woolwich Dock yard under tbe reign of James I. have a special attraction, from the remarkable detail with which we have brought down to us the story of Phineas Pett and the King's State Trial at Woolwich. In a copious diary, still preserved in tbe original manuscript, Pett narrates not only this note worthy episode, but Phineas was son of Peter Pett, master shipwright at Deptford, who gave him a good education ; but, after his father's death, he had sud denly to leave his college, in consequence of his mother having con tracted a second and imprudent marriage. He served some time with a shipwright, and then went to sea for twenty months, after which his brother Peter, who was one of Elizabeth's master shipwrights, employed him as an ordinary workman upon a vessel, The Defiance, which was in Woolwich dock, being sheathed for the voyage of Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins. This was in 1594, and in the following year he was engaged on a new ship called The Triumph. About midsummer, 1598, he tells us, there was a great stir at Woolwich, when the Eliza lieth Jonas was to be launched, preparations being made to receive the Virgin Queen on board ; but she did not come, and the launch took place without her.

But at this juncture Phineas experienced the beginning of his troubles, for in 1608 \"an inquisition for inquiring into abuses and misdemeanours by all officers,\" was ordered to be instituted, and was made the means of his cruel persecution. Over this he triumphed, but in April, 1609, he discovered another conspiracy by the rival ship wrights and other adversaries, and at once appealed to the King for protection and a fair trial. The King thereupon sent the Lord High Admiral, with the Earls of Suffolk and Winchester, on a commission of inquiry to Woolwich, where, having heard the accusers and seen the work which they con demned, they gave Pett the full assurance of their confidence, and denounced as slander and malice the motives of his enemies. These men, however, had a strong supporter in the Earl of Northampton, who protested to the King that the inquiry had been unfair ; and His Majesty, who had an exalted opinion of his own wisdom, at once decided to hear the cause in his own gracious person, appointing Monday the 8th of May, at Woolwich, for the trial. The Royal Court at Woolwich. \u2014 Both sides made busy pre paration, and a room \u2014 the workmen's dining-room, adjoining the master shipwright's quarters \u2014 was fitted up for the King's court, Pett's own dining-room being reserved for the private service of His Majesty. The house of Hugh Lydiard, Clerk of the Cheque, was appropriated to the Lord Northampton and his party of accusers, some of whom, Pett tells us, made spiteful remarks to him before the King came, and promised him that he should be hanged within a week. Pett's narrative of the affair may now be taken up, from his MS. in the Harleian collection, as follows : \u2014 On Monday morning, the 8th of May, 1609, the Lord Admiral came betimes to Woolwich, attended by Sir Robert Mansell, Sir John Trevor, and others, where his lordship was met by all those persons who were formerly warned to be there on our part. Presently after came the Lord Northampton, attended with all the spiteful crew of his informers, and he took Hugh Lydiard's house, being Clerk of the Cheque, which was fitted for him, and was there attended with all his rabble. Before His Majesty's coming, Weymouth and all his associates pried up and down the yard, belching out nothing but disgraces and deceitful speeches. They had given out that the work should be defaced at the least, which was Ukely enough to have proved so had not God put a hook in their nostrils, and, bj- the justice of the King, caused themselves to fall into the pit they designed for another. It would occupy too much space to relate in Mr. Pett's own words the previous proceedings, and the courses of the \" malicious practices \" of which he so feelingly complains. But Dr. Birch, in his \" Life of Prince Henry,\" thus tells the story \u2014"], [362, "234 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. The Earl of Northampton, who, with the wardenship of the Cinque Ports, held the post of Lord Privy Seal, conferred upon him in the end of April, 1608, had, by the instigation of some persons, who had no great regard either for the Earl of Not tingham, Lord High Admiral, or for some of the principal officers of the navy in special favour with his lordship, procured a large commission from the King for the enquiring intQ all abuses and misdemeanours committed in their several stations, under pretence of reformation, and of saving great sums to His Majesty, expended yearly in the maintenance of his ships. This enquiry was carried on by Sir Peter Bucke, Clerk of 'the Ships, Thomas Bucke, his brother, under-clerk to him ; Mr. Matthew Baker, and Mr. William Bright, principal shipwrights to the King ; Hugh Marriott, one of the six masters ; Hugh Lydiard, Clerk of the Cheque at Woolwicll ; Thomas Norris, and one Clifton, a baker, formerly purser of ships in the navy, with divers others. The persons principally questioned and aimed at were, Sir Robert Mansell, then Treasurer of the Navy ; Sir John Trevor, surveyor ; Sir Henry Palmer, comptroller ; Captain Thomas Button ; John Legat, Clerk of the Cheque at Chatham ; Mr. Phineas Pette, and Sir Thomas Bluther, then Victualler of the Navy. This enquiry, which began in 1608, was prosecuted with such violence and malice as not only occasioned a great trouble and expense to the persons accused, but likewise brought almost ruin on the navy, and a far greater yearly charge upon his Majesty than had ever been known before. The Lord Admiral, the Earl of Worcester, Master of the Horse, and the Earl of Suffolk, Lord Chamberlain, being appointed by the King to hear the cause of complaint against Mr. Pette, met at Woolwich on the 28th of April, 1609, and their report proved very favourable to him. But his Majesty resolving to hear the cause himself, went to Woolwich on Monday, May the 8th, attended by the Prince. The Trial. \u2014 Let Mr. Pett resume :\u2014 All things being in readiness, about eight o'clock* His Majesty came in his coach, attended with Prince Henry and the principal lords of his Majesty's Council. The Lord Northampton met him before he came to the ordinary gate of the yard, and used all the means he could to have led his Majesty through Lydiard's garden by a back way into his house, but his Majesty told his lordship that the Lord Admiral, whom he espied waiting at the ordinary gatet of the yard, would justly take excep tions at his so doing, for that it belonged properly there to his lordship to receive and entertain him ; so, alighting, the Lord Admiral, after his duty performed, guided his Majesty in the room purposely provided for the business. After his Majesty had a little reposed, he desired the Lord Admiral to bring him to the sight of the work then in hand, which being done, directing his Majesty to a brow or stage made at the stern of the ship, where he might take a perfect view of the whole groundwork of the frame, being then about half set up and planked as high as the wrong heads, no foot wailing as yet begun. After his Majesty had satisfied himself sufficiently, he returned back to the place again and there seated himself, the Prince and lords taking their stands on his Majesty's right hand, with the Lord Admiral and all those warned on our part ; and the Lord Northampton on the left hand of his Majesty, with all his crew of informers and others appointed to assist him on his part, of sea-masters and shipwrights of the Thames. These things thus ordered, his Majesty (silence being commanded by his gentleman-usher) began a very worthy speech ; first, to signify the cause of his coming to that place, and how much it imported the royal care of a king to take to * Early rising has always been a royal virtue. t The old gate at Church Hill."], [363, "WOOLWICH. 235 his personal examination a business of such consequence as so much concerned the strength and honour of the kingdom and state, besides the expense of his treasure. Then he addressed his speech to the actors on both sides, to those who were informers and to those who were defendants, the substance of his royal speech tending to religious exhortation, that none tin both sides should either accuse for maUce or other pretence, or excuse foT love, favour, or other particular respects ; for that his Majesty, in the seat of justice representing God's person, would not be deluded or led by \u20227py coloured pre tences from under standing the very plain truth of that business which was to be handled, and therefore wished such on both sides, whose con science accused them either of ma licious proceedings, private ends, or par tial favour, to give over and depart before they took the oaths adminis tered to them, threatening severe punishment to those who should be found offenders therein, declaring what dan ger it was to be per jured before the majesty of God and she King.

The persons were in number\u2014 on the Lord Northampton's side, fourteen seamen, eight shipwrights, and two informers ; on the other side, fourteen seamen, and thirteen shipwrights. These several persons called and appearing, the form of the oath was read unto them by the Earl of Salisbury, Lord Treasurer, who personated the Clerk of the Ses sion, and the book was presented to them by the Right Honourable Charles Howard."], [364, "236 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Earl of Nottingham, Lord High Admiral. This and these ceremonies performed, his Majesty willed the Lord Northampton to begin his accusation, and then I was caUed personally to answer, and kneeled right before his Majesty, the Lord Admiral stand ing on my right hand, Sir Robert Mansel and Sir John Trevor standing both right behind me. The accusation against me was exhibited by Lord Northampton in \u25a0writing, containing sundry articles in point of my sufficiency, art, and experience, and in point of my care and honesty in discharge of my duty in unserviceable materials, to the great detriment of his Majesty's service. His Majesty perceiving the articles to be many and very intricate to answer each particular, very judiciously contracted the business to three principal heads \u2014 the point of art, the point of sufficiency of materials, and the point of charge ; and to these heads I was commanded to make my answers and they their accusations. I must confess that at the first I was so daunted at the majesty ofthe King, the power of my enemies, and the confused urging of the objections, that I was confounded in myseU tiU it pleased God, by the help of the Lord Treasurer and his discreet directions, I was recollected and recovered my spirits, and so orderly answered to each objection, his Majesty still holding us on both sides to the proportions. Much time was spent in dispute of proportions, comparing my present frame with former precedents, and dimensions for the best ships for length, breadth, depth, floor, and other circumstances, in aU which they could not fasten anything upon me, but reflected to their disgrace and apparent breach of oath and plain demonstration and expression of combined prac tice. One point of proportion was mainly insisted upon, and with much violence and eagerness urged on both sides, which was the square of the ship's flat in the midships, they offering constantly upon their oath that it was full thirteen feet, we as constantly insisting that it was eleven feet eight inches. But because this difference was long and could not be tried upon the smaU plats, his Majesty referred the trial to be made on the great platform which was purposely framed of planks to the fuU scale of the ship, where all the lines of the midship bend were drawn and the square of the flat only described, with their centres, perpendiculars, and swreeps, which trial, because it much concerned the truth or falsity of all the rest, his Majesty would not give trust to any of those who by oath were interested in the same, but made choice of the noble and worthy knight, Sir Thomas Chaloner, the Governor of the Prince his .Highness's household, and of the learned Rev. Mr. Briggs, reader of geometry, lecturer in Gresham CoUege in London, and Master of Arts, student in St. John's CoUege, Cam bridge, who were to decide the controversy. This thus concluded, we came to the point of charge, to which was answered that the charge of building this ship should not exceed other ships that had been built in her Majesty's tune (I mean Queen Elizabeth of famous and happy memory), allowing for proportion, the garnishing not exceeding theirs. This gave full satisfaction to the point of charge, being the second head propounded. It being then almost one o'clock, his Majesty caUed for his dinner, referring the other points to be handled in the ship after dinner. All this time I sat on my knees, baited by the great lord and his bandogs, sometimes by Baker, sometimes by Stevens, Bright, Clay, gaping Weymouth, and sometimes confused by aU, and, which was worse, his Majesty's countenance still bent upon me ; so that I was almost dis heartened and out of breath, albeit the Prince's Highness standing near me from time to time encouraged me as far as he might without offence to his father, labouring to have me eased by standing up, but his Majesty would not permit it. So soon as his Majesty and the Lords had dined, the King rose and went into the body of the frame of the ship to make trial of the goodness of the materials. All the lower futtocks were placed, and many other futtocks also. The adverse party had chalked almost half the lower futtocks for red-wood, cross-grained, and merely un serviceable, aU which timber his Majesty caused to be dubbed by workmen ready"], [365, "237 WOOLWICH. with their tools for that purpose ; and, being tried, they were aU approved very sound and serviceable ; and, touching the cross-grained timber, his Majesty said very earnestly \u2014 \" The cross-grain is in the men and not in the timber.\" His Majesty spent much time in the survey of these things, still opening way to what objections the adverse party could allege and what answer I could make for my defence. This business performed within board, his Majesty well satisfied in every particular, he openly deUvered that the ship would be too strong if one third part of the timber were left out, and then began to give a princely countenance and encour agement, protesting often-times that all this grievous accusation proceeded of nothing but maUce. Then his Majesty came without board, and curiously surveyed the planks, the tree-nails, and workmanship, all which gave such satisfaction as stiU con firmed his opinion of their maUcious proceedings. All the while his Majesty was intent upon this search, the gentlemen forenamed who were appointed for the trial of the point of the true flat of the floor, were busied in taking the measures from the ship and bringing them to the platform ; and when they found by due trial all lines to be truly set ofl', they acquainted his Majesty that aU these things were in readiness. His Majesty having then received satisfaction of all things about the frame, repaired to the platform, attended with the Prince, lords, and many thousand spectators besides. His Majesty called the gentlemen to measure each dimension of breadth and depth for his own satisfaction, and then, coming to the point of the square of the floor, whether it were answering their assertion of thirteen feet or agreeable to ours of eleven feet eight inches. The square of thirteen feet was tried from the true centre and perpendicular, which, being applied to the swaps of the mould, did differ about sixteen inches at the wrong head ; the Uke trial made by our true centre and perpendicular feU as just in our Unes as could be'possible ; which done, his Majesty, with a loud voice, commandeth the measurers to declare pubUcly the very truth ; which, when they had delivered clearly on our side, aU the multitude heaved up their hats and gave a great and loud shout and acclamation. And then the Prince his Highness called with a high voice in these words : \u2014 \" Where be now these perjured fellows that dare thus abuse his Majesty with these false informations . Do they not worthily deserve hanging . \" By that tune aU these things were performed, and his Majesty wonderfully satis lied, and it growing something late, his Majesty returned into the haU again where he formerly sat, and being placed and the room being liUed as full as it could be packed, his Majesty began a most worthy and learned speech for conclusion of the business, wherein he expressed with many effectual speeches, what content he received in bestowing his pains that day to so good a purpose. Next, his Majesty addressed himself to the Lord Northampton for his great care and diligence for searching out such errors in the office of the Admiralty, wherein his Majesty and State were abused, with encouragement for him to go forward with prosecuting his commission, notwithstancUng his lordship had been misinformed by being drawn to question this business. He next directed his speech to Mr. Baker, Bright, Stevens, and aU the rest of the informers, very bitterly reprehending their malicious practice, more to bring to effect their own private ends than out of any con ceivable care of the good of his Majesty's service or benefit of the State, repining at the preferment I had and the countenance of his son, the Prince, combining together to disgrace and ruin me (though otherwise they envied one another, and were at contro versy who should be preferred to my business) ; with many good exhortations to will them to beware how they did abuse the majesty of God, and himself, his substitute, with maUciou3 informations, in which he could do no less than think them perjured, as in the prosecuting of this whole business was too apparent to himself and all the Q"], [366, "238 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. world ; whereby they deserved to be punished severely, if he should censure them as they worthily merited. His Majesty then began to shew me a very pleasing countenance, and turned his speech to me, willing me not to be discountenanced with these proceedings against me, seeing he was now sufficiently persuaded of my honesty, integrity, and ability to perform what I had undertaken ; advising me not to refuse council of my feUow-ser vants, since it was his service, wherein we ought to join together for his good and the honour of the State, with many other princely expressions of his good opinion of me, and readiness not only to give me countenance but assurance of future favour toward me ; and, lastly, he cleared all imputations and aspersions unjustly cast upon the Lord Admiral, with recital of all his honourable service performed to the honour Water Procession of James I. (Even on common occasions the sovereign moved upon the Thames with regal pomp, surrounded by boats, and guards, and musicians.) of the State and his perpetual fame ; commending his great wisdom and impartial carriage of himseU in this day's trial, wherein he was never observed to give impedi ment to his Majesty's proceedings, but all furtherance possible, as was both evidently manifest to his Majesty by the great pains he had endured that day, and the noble patience he had given public testimony of to all present who were eyewitnesses, with many other gracious speeches to put new Use and power into him, to go on as he had begun, to the perpetual remitting his name and honour. Then giving general thanks to those who had taken pains in that day's business, with protestations of his princely, care in all matters of such consequence for the safety and honour of the State and kingdom, he concluded his speech. Then the noble AdmUal, as his Majesty was rising, humbly besought his Majesty to license him to speak a few words, as well to declare his own innocency concerning these unjust accusations, as to clear me in the point of my insufficiency and care and honesty to perform the service entrusted to me, to which his honour's request (though"], [367, "WOOLWICH. 239 tc be late) his Majesty most willingly condescended. The sum of his eech tended to admire and extol his Majesty's justice, great wisdom, and ly care us the good of the commonwealth, in that he had refused no pains (as this day's work and honourable assembly could justly witness) to provide, to rectify, and to set straight, to the wonder and admiration of them all, a work of so great con sequence and of such a kind of intricacy as his Majesty had never been accustomed to before, and yet so clearly to examine and try in so short a space as if he had been only bred and accustomed to such elements, with many other speeches tending to that purpose. His lordship then, laying his hand upon my head, standing next to him upon his right hand, did there freely offer to pawn all his lands, his honour, and his Use, in my behalf, for the performance and finishing of this royal work, which being once perfected, if his Majesty (by advice of the best artists and seamen of his kingdom) should dislike, he would willingly, with the aid of his friends, take off from his Maj esty 's hands, at his and their proper charge, without any damage to his Majesty. To this speech his Majesty replied briefly with a gracious acknow ledgment of his princely acceptance of his lord ship's true and faithful service and zeal, ex pressed in that his worthy speech, of which he had so great assur ance, as he confidently protested, never King could be more happy than himself in the ser vice of such an honour able subject ; and, there fore, there was no need why he should any way engage either himself or Henry, Prince of Wales. his honour in that which his Majesty had by the course of upright justice before the face of God and the world, so apparently cleared. This said, his Majesty arose. In passing through the hall, the Lord Admiral going before and leading me in his hand, the Lord Thomas Howard, then' Lord Chamberlain of the Household, made a motion to his Majesty to lay a charge upon me, that I should not make any quarrel against any person or persons that had that day given information against me, alleging, he knew ray stomach to be such as, if I were not contained by his Majesty's commandment, I would call them to account for their doings, whereupon blood might ensue. His Majesty gave ear to what his lordship advised, gave him thanks for his worthy counsel, and, calling me to him before the whole company, I sitting upon my knees he gave me an especial charge upon my allegiance and life, that I should not quarrel Q 2"], [368, "240 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. or chaUenge any person or persons whatsoever that had that day given irjf against me, aUeging I had honour sufficient to have been cleared of aU q objections unjustly charged against me by the equity of my cause and his justice. This speech concluded, his Majesty hasted to take his coach, which attended at the gate. His Majesty gave me his hand to kiss, with such an expression of princely favour and encouragement to proceed cheerfully in my business, as did not only infuse new Use into me, but also gave great comfort and content to aU standers-by. Then I presented myself on my knee to the most noble prince, my then master, who, taking me from the ground, did so affectionately express his joy for my clearing, and the satisfaction that his father had received that day, that he protested he would not only countenance and comfort me hereafter, but take great care to provide for me and my posterity whUst he Uved. I received the Uke courtesy from aU the lords, who declared their joy for the happy success God gave me in this great deliverance. The great Lord Northampton, seeing the event of this business, and that aU things sorted out clear contrary to his expectations, raiUng,bitterly against his informing instruments, took the way back to his coach, and would not so much as take leave of his Majesty, but passed away with no Uttle expression of great discontent, as did also the rest of their partakers. The Lord Admiral attended his Majesty, being never better content in all his Use, and returned to Whitehall with the company, it being almost eight o'clock before they went from Woolwich. This day it was very tedious to me by reason I was to answer all objections, and kneel so long together ; so was ita day of jubilee to me, a day never to be forgotten by me nor mine, wherein my good God shewed me wonderful favour and mercy to enable me to endure the frowns of the King, and to strengthen my weak abUities to withstand the maUce of such and so many powerful adversaries by the space of one whole summer's day. After the Verdict. \u2014 The remarkable event here related will pro bably not escape the observation of future English historians. It illustrates not only an important epoch in our naval progress, but brings into relief the character of the all-sufficient monarch who founded the Stuart line and united the kingdoms of Great Britain. The trial of Phineas Pett might well form the subject of an historical picture. Failing such representation, I am fain to borrow the figure of the King in his state chair at page 235 from the picture of \" James I. and the French Ambassador.\" The cushion at the sovereign's footstool is painfully suggestive of poor Pett kneeling for the greater part of a long summer's day, in physical torture and mental tension, which he so acutely depicts. But his triumph was complete, and he goes on to tell us that \u2014 The next day, being the 9th of May, I began to work again, every man striving to express his willingness thereunto, by reason of the great encouragement his Majesty had publicly and generously given them ; and, within two or three days after, the Lord Admiral, Sir Robert Mansell, Sir John Trevor, advising together with me, we resolved to move the Lords of the CouncU to have two principal men who were ship- wrights, to be by their order appointed to repair twice at least in the week to Wool- wich, to survey the provisions, and to foresee that no unserviceable materials should be wrought upon the ship, which we did to clear aU suspicions of any ends of our own. This accordingly was consented to of the Lords, and Mr. Matthew Baker and Henry Reynolds were appointed to be overseers, who, for fashion's sake, some three"], [369, "241 WOOLWICH. ;raes came to Woolwich, but, finding our care to be more to perform honestly . could be to prevent with their best endeavours, they gave over the trust recommended to them , and left me to myself. Pett's enemies, however, had not quite done with him, for a little later he says \u2014 Thursday in Whitsun week, his Majesty began to hear the great and general cause of the navy in his Presence Chamber at Greenwich, wherein three whole days were spent in several examinations of the truth and circumstances of the informations deUvered by the Lord Northampton and his agents against Sir Robert Mansell, Sir John Trevor, and Captain Button, Sir Thomas Bluther, Mr. Leggatt, and many others, together with myseU. First day, the Lord Northampton made me the very entrance into the business, a great complaint of the dishonour he reaped by the hearing at Woolwich, insisting very maliciously in incensing his Majesty against me and others who, as he said, traduced him in every tavern and ale-bench, to his great dishonour and therefore humbly besought his Majesty that business might be again called in question, aUeging the confidence of the informers, who were ready to maintain the truth of their former information with their lives. His Majesty, taking it Ul that my lord should dare to question his first proceedings, which he had taken such pains personally to hear determined, took him short with a sharp reprehension, and wiUed him no further to insist upon that whereof his Majesty and the whole world were bo sufficiently satisfied."], [370, "Charles I. CHAPTER XXI. UNDER THE STUARTS. Prince Henry's Affection for Woolwich. \u2014 On tbe 13th of August, 1608, Prince HeDry's growing affection for the navy led him to make a visit to the royal dock at Woolwich. We read that \u2014 The Prince took his barge at Blackwall and came to Woolwich about noon, accompanied only with his own train. He was received by Mr. Pett on shore at the yard stairs. On the poop of the Royal Anne were placed trumpets and an ensign, and on the heads of both of the niizens, two ensigns. Mr. Pett having paid his compliments to the Prince, and represented how great a satisfaction it would be to all the seamen to perceive his Highness so well affected to the navy, he conducted the Prince round about the dock, and so directly aboard the Royal Anne, to the very top of her poop, where he gave a signal to Mr. William Bull, the Master-Gunner of England, who stood ready prepared upon a mount* with thirty-one great brass cham- bers, orderly and distinctly placed, which had been procured from the Tower for that purpose by Mr. Pett with the assistance of the Master-Gunner, who, upon the signal made, gave fire to the train, .and discharged the whole volley with such good order as was highly satisfactory to the Prince, and the more so because it was unexpected. When the ordnance ceased firing, Mr. Pett kneeled to his Highness, and requested him to accept this poor sea-entertainment as an unfeigned earnest of duty to him. * Probably Bowater Hill."], [371, "PLATE XXVI.

The Prince returned a most gracious answer, and then ordered Mr. Pett to lead him into aU the parts of the ship, which having viewed with a singular pleasure he was conducted to the dockyard, where the keel, stem, and stern of his own ship, which was to be built, lay ready framed . Having examined these with great attention, his Highness caused the length of the keel to be measured, and being then desired to walk into the house to rest himself, he readily consented, and found in the parlour a 6et banquet of sweetmeats and all other fruits which the season yielded, with plenty of wine \u2014 Rhenish, white sack, Greek, and claret. After he had refreshed himself, and given his hand to kiss to divers gentlewomen of the town, who were in the room with Mr. Pett's wife, he desired to be conducted to the mount where the chambers were placed, which were again charged and ranged in their former order with the train made ready. This sight deUghted him so much, that he was desirous to have the train fired while he stood by ; but at Mr. Pett's entreaty and representation of the danger, he ordered that at the holding up of his handkerchief in his barge they should be discharged, which was accordingly done, after his Highness had expressed his satisfaction in the whole entertainment. Again, says Mr. Pett \u2014 The last days of January, 1610, the Prince's Highness came to Woolwich to see what forwardness the ship was in, where I gave him and his followers entertainment. Also on the 1st of February, the ringers at St. Margaret's * were paid 2s. 6d. for ringing for the king. We may continue for a while longer Mr. Pett's interesting narra tive : \u2014 On the 18th of June, 1610, the Prince's Highness came to Woolwich to see the ship, which was now in great forwardness, and almost ready, and the next day he came thither again, in company with the King his father, and a great train attending on them. In the afternoon his Majesty spent almost two hours in great content, in surveying the ship, both within and without, protesting it did not repent him to have taken such great pains in examination of the business of the work, since the fruit thereof yielded him such content. His Majesty then did me the honour to come into the house, where my wife had prepared a banquet of sweetmeats and such fruits as were then to be had, whereof he was pleased to taste plentifully, and did very graciously accept of his homely entertainment, giving me special command not to launch the ship tiU his progress was ended, t Between Easter and Michaelmas that the ship began to be garnished, it is incredible what numbers of people continually resorted to Woolwich, of all sorts, both nobles, gentry, and citizens, and from all parts of the country round about, which was no small charge to me in giving daily entertainment to all comers, which could not possibly be avoided in that place at such a time. The 9th of September, being Sunday, about six o'clock in the morning, divers London maids, coming to see the ship, brought in their company a Uttle boy of twelve yeare old, the only child of his mother, a widow woman dweUing in Tower Street, who carelessly going up and * The parish church of \" St. Mary \" must be meant here. t This ship had been nearly two years in building, having been begun October 20th, 1608. A contemporary description of her says: \"The keele of this most goodly shippe for warre is 114 feet long, and the cross-beam 44 feet in length. She will carry threescore and foure pieces of great ordinance, and is of the burthen of 1,400 tons.\""], [374, "244 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. down upon the mam orlop, fell down into the hold of the ship, and was thereby so bruised and broken that he died before midnight, being the first mischance that had happened in the whole time of the ship's building. About the middle of this month, being ready to have the ship strucken down upon her ways, I caused twelve of the choice master carpenters of his Majesty's navy to be sent for from Chatham to be assisting in her striking and launching ; and, upon the 18th day, being Tuesday, she was safely set upon her ways, and this day Sir Robert Mansell dined at my lodgings. The 20th of this month the French Ambassador came to Woolwich to see the ship, whom I entertained in the best manner I could, and in the time of Ids being with me, the Prince, my royal master', sent me a wonderful fat buck, which he kiUed with his own hand.* Now began we on all sides for the preparation to launch the ship, and for that purpose there was provided a rich standard of taffety very fairly gUded with gold, with his Majesty's arms, to be placed on the poop, and a very large ensign of crimson rich taffety, with a canton of the Prince's crest, to be placed upon the quarter-deck ; and all other ornaments were carefully provided befitting that purpose. There was a standing set up in the most convenient place of the yard for his Majesty, the Queen, and the royal children, and places fitted for the ladies and councU aU raUed in and boarded. All the rooms, both in my own lodgings and at Mr. Lydiard's, were prepared, and very handsomely hanged and furnished with a cloth of state, chairs, stools, and other necessaries. Nothing was omitted that could be imagined any ways necessary both for ease and entertainment. Upon Sunday in the afternoon, being the 23rd, Sir Robert Mansell, Sir John Trevor, and Sir Henry Palmer, came to Woolwich to see how everything was ordered ; and, finding aU things prepared and fitted to their liking, about three o'clock they returned aU to Deptford, where they lodged that night with Sir Robert ManseU. This evening very late, there came a messenger to me from Court at Theobalds, to give me orders to be very careful to search the ship's hold for feare some persons disaffected might have bored some holes privily in the ship to sink her after she should be launched; but my care had prevented their fears beforehand so far as could be searched or discovered. On Monday morning, assisted by the help of my brother Simonson, and sundry others of my friends, we opened the dock-gates, and made all things ready against the tide, but the wind blowing very hard at south-west kept out the flood, so that it proved a very bad tide, Uttle better than a neap, which put us afterwards to great trouble and hazard. The King's Majesty came from Theobalds, though he had been very ill with surfeiting from eating grapes, and landed here about eleven o'clock. Prince Henry attended him, and most of the Lords of the Council. The Lord Admiral, attended by the principal officers of the nawy, together with myseff, received him on land out of his barge, and conducted him to the place provided for him in Mr. Lydiard's house. His dinner was dressed in our great kitchen. After dinner came the Queen's Majesty, accompanied with the Duke of York, Lady EUzabeth, and divers great lords and ladies in her train, the drums and trumpets placed on the poop and forecastle, and the wind instruments by them, so that nothing was wanting to so great a royalty that could be desired. When it grew towards high water, and all things ready, and a great close Ughter made fast to the ship's stern, and the Queen's Majesty with her train placed, the Lord Admiral gave me commandment to heave taut the crabs and screws, though I had Uttle hope to * On August 31st of this year (1610), Mr. Pett wrote to the Prince at Nonesuch, where he was hunting, reminding his Royal Highness that \" he had of his nobleness promised to send me a buck to Woolwich, because he had then given aU away that were fallen that day.\""], [375, "245 WOOLWICH. launch, by reason the wind over-blew the tide, yet the ship started; and had launched but the dock-gates pent her in so straight that she stuck fast between them, by reason the ship was nothing Usted by the tide, as we expected she would ; and the great lighter, by unadvised counsel, being cut off the stern, the ship settled so hard upon the ground that there was no possibihty of launching that tide ; besides which, there was a multitude of people got into the ship, that one could scarce stir by another. The noble Prince himself, accompanied with the Lord Admiral and other great Lords, were on the poop, where the great standing gilt cup was ready fiUed with wine, to name the ship so soon as she had been afloat, according to ancient custom and ceremony performed at such times, by drinking part of the wine, giving the ship her name, and heaving the standing cup overboard. The King's Majesty was much grieved at the frustrate of his expectation, coming on purpose, though very Ul at ease, to have done me honour. But God saw it not so good for me, and therefore sent this cross upon me, both to humble me and to make me know that however we proposed He would dispose all things as He pleased ; so that about five o'clock hi3 Majesty with the Queen and all her train departed away to Greenwich, where the household were removed. Prince Henry stayed a good while after his Majesty was gone, conferring with the Lord Admiral, principal officers, and myseU, what was to be done, and, leaving the Lord Admiral to stay here to see that aU things were performed that were resolved on, he took horse, and rode after them to Greenwich with promise to return presently after midnight. So soon as the multitude were gone and all things quiet, we went presently in hand to make way with the sides of the gates ; and having great store of scavel-men and other labourers, we had made aU things ready before any flood came, which per- formed, every man applied himself to get victuals' and to take rest. The Lord Admiral sat up aU night in a chair in his chamber tUl the tide was come about the ship, and Sir Robert ManseU, Sir John Trevor, and Sir Henry Palmer, and the rest, made a shift in my lodging to rest themselves. The beginning of the night was very fair, and bright moonshine, the moon being a Uttle past fuU ; but after midnight the weather was sore overcast, and a very sore gust of rain, thunder, and lightning, which made me doubt that there were some indirect working among our enemies to dash our launching.* These gusts lasted about half an hour with great extremity, the wind being at south-west. In the midst of this great gust Prince Henry and all his train were taken upon the top of Blackheath in their coming to Woolwich ; but his invincible spirit, daunted with nothing, made little account of it, but came through, and was no sooner ahghted in the yard, but calling for the Lord Admiral and myself, and Sir Robert Mansell, went all presently on board the ship, being about two o'clock, almost an hour before high water, and was no sooner entered but the word being given to set all taut, the ship went away without any straining of screws or tackles till she came clear afloat in the middle of the channel, to the great joy and comfort of the Prince's Highness, the Lord Admiral, and aU the rest of my noble friends ; which mercy of God to me I pray I may never forget. His Highness then standing upon the poop, with a selected company only, besides the trumpeters, with a great deal of expression of princely joy, and with the ceremony of drinking in the standing cup, threw all the wine forwards towards the half deck, and solemnly calling her by the name of the Prince Royal, the trumpets sounding all the while, with many gracious words to me, gave the standing cup into my own hands, and would not go from the ship tUl he saw her fast at her moorings. In heaving down to her moorings, we found that all the hawsers that were laid ashore for landfasts were treacherously cut, to put the ship to hazards of running ashore, if God had not blessed us better. In * Mr. Pett was not free from the then prevalent superstition of witchcraft."], [376, "246 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. the interim of warping to her moorings, his Highness went down to the platform of the cock -room, where the ship's beer stood for the ordinary company, and there finding an old can without a lid, went and drew it full of beer himself, and drank it off to the Admiral, and caused him with the rest of his attendants to do the like. At nine the same morning, being very rainy, he took his barge, accompanied with the Lord Admiral and the rest of his train, and giving us a princely gracious farewell, rode against the tide to Greenwich, where he made relation of all the business and the circumstances thereof to the King his father. We then came ashore to refresh our selves with victuals, and to take some rest, having toiled all the night before ; and amongst the rest Sir Henry Palmer was pleased to stay dinner, where we drank Prince Henry's health round, to handsel the standing cup given at the launching. The Queen Mother. \u2014 Queen Anne of Denmark was another believer in Pett. In Strickland's \" Lives \" we are told that the Queen was persuaded by her son, Henry, Prince of Wales, to attend at Wool wich the launch of a ship which had been built by the Prince's favourite architect, Phineas Pett. \"Young as Henry was,\" says Mrs. Strickland, \" he had already supported this valuable servant of the country against the insolence and oppression of the arbitrary junto of which the King's favourite, Somerset, was the tool. The Queen threw all her influ ence in the support of her virtuous and right-judging son, not because he was virtuous and just, but because her strong maternal instinct and her queenly pride were alike centred in her firstborn, the darling of her heart and the delight of her eyes.\" Anne of Denmark. Prince Henry's Fate.\u2014 Prince Henry's sudden and suspicious death, which occurred in November, 1612, in his eighteenth year, to the great grief of the nation and the special sorrow of Woolwich, deprived Pett of a powerful auxiliary and excellent friend. But the King, who was lampooned as the \"most learned fool in Europe,\" and has even been suspected of connivance at his son's assassination, was true to his son's companion, Pett. He con tinued also to take an interest in Woolwich, and, so long as he had health and vigour, his Majesty was a staunch supporter of the Royal Navy. The King of Denmark. \u2014 Although the diary of Mr. Pett has"], [377, "247 WOOLWICH. taken up so much space, a few further extracts are indispensable. He says \u2014 On the 22nd of June, 1613, the King of Denmark came suddenly to Somerset, House unexpected. The 1st of August, my gracious master King James, with the King of Denmark, Prince of Wales, and many other lords, came to Woolwich, and went on board the Mer Honeur, then lying in the dry dock and almost finished, which ship liked them wondrous well. Decline Of James. \u2014 James ruled for twelve years longer, but his zeal for the navy, so long sustained, did not increase with his infirmities, and there are signs of some falling off in our dockyard towards the end. It is, indeed, to be assumed that its enemies and rivals began to make way as the vigilance of the monarch declined, and, in the last year of his life, Chatham had obtained such an ascendancy that there was a vast increase of employment there in consequence of the removal of works from Woolwich and Deptford. The King's Death. \u2014 The dockyard fell undoubtedly into a state of neglect when King James died. We perceive that in the second year of Charles I. (1627), Captain John Mason writes from Wool wich to say that all things are ruined there, for the particular ends of someone, and will cost much labour to rectify. If his Majesty (Charles I.) be pleased to keep tbe use of this dock, it will, he adds, be necessary to appoint someone to take care thereof, and Captain John Mason modestly proposes himself. Under Charles I. \u2014 The shipwrights were in a state of discontent approaching insubordination. One of their number, named Edward Stevens, was, in 1626, committed to prison for disrespectful words spoken to Sir Sackville Trevor and Captain Pett, on the survey of the Triumph at Woolwich ; and although Charles I. seems to have paid a visit to the place shortly afterwards, matters still went on badly. The slackness of work is shown in a petition sent to the King from the ship-carpenters at Woolwich, soliciting employment in the navy, for \"as the King's works expire they are all discharged in tbe dead of winter,\" and it is clear that for some years the yard had been almost ignored. One entry seems to imply that tbe whole establishment had been condemned by Charles I. or his father, both of whom were supposed to have been jealous of Prince Henry's popularity, and not too much pleased with his partiality for Woolwich. Regarded from the present distance of time the assumption seems unjust, and it is more probable that the influence of the King's opponents in Parliament was at the root of the mischief. Supplies were granted with a niggard hand, wholesale retrenchments were demanded, and the services were worried with perpetual inquisitions and changes. The effect upon Woolwich is shown in a letter from the officers of the navy dated 1628,"], [378, "248 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. recommending the reappointment of John May as assistant to the Master Shipwright at Woolwich Dock, from which he was said to have been \" discharged by the late Commissioners at a time when the dock was cast as of no use at that time.\" The troubles of the King and his Parliament were beginning, and the whole town was in one of its periodical depressions for several years. The distress among its water men was such that, for want of employment on the river, they were driven elsewhere, perhaps to that common refuge, the sea ; and on Febru ary 2nd, 1629, when there was a muster of all the watermen belonging to the port of London and the liberties thereof, Gravesend sent 121 and Greenwich 128 ; while Deptford could find but 20, and Woolwich and Erith together contributed only 19. A Visit from King Charles. \u2014 Through all the tribulation, however, Phineas Pett had won the favour of Charles as he had previously gained the good graces of his royal brother and father, and although the new king had an impoverished exchequer, he found some work for Pett's shipwrights, and paid frequent visits to Woolwich Dockyard. In his diary of 1631, Mr. Pett says : \u2014 The 21st of April, his Majesty (Charles I.), with divers ofthe lords, viz. Treasurer, Chamberlain, Marquis of Hamilton, Holland, and others, came to Woolwich to see the Vanguard launched, which was performed to his Majesty's great content, I entertained them in my lodgings with cakes, wine, and other things, that were weU accepted. His Majesty commanded me into his barge with him, designing to see the St. Dennis at Deptford, in the dry dock, but, the rain preventing him, I was put into a pair of oars. On Friday morning the Victory, lying above the Vanguard, was launched out of the same dock.* In the beginning of the year 1632, I was com manded to assist my son Peter in budding a new ship of eight hundred tons at Woolwich, which was begun in February, most part of her frame being made in the forest of Shotover, and Stowkwood, Oxfordshire. My son had the oversight of the work. About the 8th of June, his Majesty came to Woolwich to see the work. I entertained him in my lodgings. Again, in 1633\u2014 The 30th of January, the new ship at Woolwich was launched, his Majesty being present, and stood in my lodgings. The ship's name was Charles, after his own name. The next day Mr. Goddard's ship was launched ; the King and Queen were present, and was called after the Queen's name, the Henrietta Maria. The Chronic Fluctuation. \u2014 Another ship, called the Unicorn, was also launched here on February 6th, 1633, \" though they had no more water than the ship drew,\" and a few fitful orders kept the works going. But matters nevertheless did not improve, and great misery prevailed continually until 1634, in the March of which year Secretary Windebank reported that he had, according to his Majesty's command- * It was a \" double dock,\" being twice the usual length."], [379, "249 WOOLWICH. ment, advised with Sir Robert Mansell concerning the petition of the carpenters intended to have been presented to his Majesty at Woolwich, and found their complaint in some circumstances just, and \" a necessity for keeping them in work.\" He had ascertained that they were sus pended by the officers of the navy, on the Lords of the Admiralty respit ing the allowance of the estimate for reparation of the hulls of the King's ships, which are in some decay, and he therefore begged tbe King to order Secretary Coke to have them repaired, \" they being now unserviceable, and continual reports of great preparations upon the coast of France. The King's honour and safety,\" he adds, \" consists in his navy, and money must be found for reparation of those hulls, whatsoever else be slowed.\" A National Crisis. \u2014 Affairs were really becoming critical, for the King bad dissolved his Parliament and was endeavouring, in the teeth of the Constitution and the protests of the nation, to rule without an elected assembly. Foes were threatening from within and from without, and at last Charles seems to have decided that he must increase the power of his fleet. Accordingly in 1634 he levied that \"ship money\" tax which so much deepened his people's dissatisfaction with his reign, and hastened the coming climax. It is said to have been an impost as righteous as most taxes are, and it at least brought advantage to Woolwich in an order to build tbe finest ship of war that had ever been seen. The \"Royal Sovereign.\" \u2014 The great vessel was called the Royal Sovereign, and she was launched in 1637. Several descriptions of her are extant, and she is fairly delineated in the illustration on Plate XXIV. One writer says, that \" the piece of timber which made the kelson was so great and weighty that twenty- eight oxen and four horses had much difliculty in dragging it to the waterside.\" The ship was 1637 tons burden, corresponding with the date of the year \u2014 a coincidence which was said to have been undesigned. She had \" three decks and five lanthornes at her mastsheads, the biggest of which would hold ten persons standing upright without shouldering.\" This writer, whose description was published the same year, concludes by an encouragement to all faithful and loving subjects to be \" liberal contributories towards the ship-money.\" Stow's \" Survey \" has the following details : \u2014 In Woolwich Dock hath been buUt the beat ships of war ; amongst which the Royal Sovereign, anno 1637 ; being in length by the keel 127 foot ; in breadth by the beam 47 foot ; and in depth 49 foot ; her draught of water 21 foot ; her burden in all 2,072 tuns, and 1,492 tuns, besides guns, tackle, &c. She hath six anchors, whereof the biggest weighs 6,000 Ub., and the least 4,300 lib. She hath fourteen cables, whereof the"], [380, "250 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. greatest is 666 inches in diameter,* and 21 inches in compass, and weighs 9,000 lib.; her least cable being 254 inches diameter and 8 inches in circumference, and weighs near 1,300 lib. Unto her belonged eighteen masts and yards, whereof the mainmast is 113 foot long and 33 inches diameter ; her main yard 105 foot long and 23 inches diameter. She carried several sorts of sails, of which her greatest is her main course, together with her bonnet, which contains 1,640 yards of canvas. One complete set or suit of sails belonging to her will cost ,\u00a3404 sterling. She carries a long boat of 50 foot, a pinnace of 36 foot, and a skiff of 27 foot long. The weight of her rigging is 33 tuns. She carries three tiers of guns, all of brass ; whereof there are 44 in her upper tier, 34 in her second, and 22 in her lower tier \u2014 in aU 100 guns. Her complement of mariners, soldiers, and officers is 850 men. Her whole charge for wages, diet, ammunition, with wear and tear, for every month that she is at sea, costs the King i!3,500, as hath been computed by experienced accomptants. This royal ship was curiously carved and gUt with gold, so that when she was in the engagement against the Dutch, they gave her the name of The Golden Devil, her guns being whole cannon, making such havoc and slaughter among them. The following is Phineas Pett's account of the building and launching of the ship : \u2014 The 3rd of February, 1637, his Majesty, the Prince Elector, and divers lords, came to Woolwich hy water, and after viewing the work without board, they did the same within board, both aloft and in the hold, being well satisfied. Then retiring to my lodgings, they staid till the flood, and then returned in his Majesty's barge to White hall. Tuesday, the 29th of August, proved very rainy, yet the shipwrights of the river, who were called to help to strike the ship on her ways, being come, we struck her by eleven o'clock. The 25th of September was the day peremptorily appointed by his Majesty to launch the ship, so everything was prepared to be in readiness. His Majesty, accompanied by the Queen, and all the lords and ladies and their attendants, landed at Woolwich dock stairs about twelve o'clock, and went directly on board the ship, where, staying about an hour, they retired into our room furnished for their entertainment. About two o'clock the tackles were heaved taut, and the ship started till the tackles failed and the water pinched, being a very bad tide. Then we shored the ship, and their Majesties returned to Whitehall, very sorry she could not be launched. After attempting two or three tides, we concluded to stay till the next spring, which was about the 12th of October ; in the interim many reports were raised to disable the ship and disgrace me. Sir Robert Mansell called a meeting at Woolwich of such Trinity masters as were employed in the business, with all the officers of the navy, to resolve on the time of launching, which was generally concluded to be the Sunday following, being October 14th, and that I should not attempt to stir her before. But the Saturday night, the wind chopping fair westerly, promising a great tide, I caused the two masters of the navy to be ready, commanding all the hands we could on sudden to attend us, \u25a0contrary to the mind of Mr. Cooke who was unwilling to meddle with the ship in .the night. But Mr. Ausiem, being the most resolute man, was for taking the first opportunity. The tide came on so fast that the ship was afloat by three-quarters flood, so I ordered to heave her out, which done, and the ship brought into the channel by several warps, she was got to her moorings, lights being made all along the shore with reeds tiU the moorings were made fast to the bits, which done, I sent * Stow's \" diameter \" here probably stands for length. In that case the ship's cables would have been respectively 55 and 21 feet long, but it is difficult to reconcile the weights."], [381, "251 WOOLWICH. a messenger to Sir Robert ManseU at Greenwich, who came aboard with all speed and, according to His Majesty's order, called her the Sovereign of the Seas.* The next morning the Trinity masters and others came to give their attendance, but finding the ship at her moorings they were much discontented, which they expressed as much as they could. This morning Sir Robert ManseU rode post to his Majesty, then at Hampton Court, and acquainted him with our proceedings, with which he was well pleased. The week foUowing we reared our sheers to set our masts, which was all done in fourteen days, and as soon as the rigging was fixed and the sails at the yards, we removed from Woolwich to Erith for depth of water. His Majesty had been on board before she removed thence. The 6th of June following (1638), his Majesty with the Queen, the Duchess of Sheverees, Duke and Duchess of Lenox, and divers other lords and ladies, came on board the ship at Greenhithe, where they dined. At their going away we gave them seventeen guns. About the 12th of June the Sovereign weighed from Greenhithe, and anchored below Gravesend, where she rode till his Majesty came on board, which was July 21st. I had placed my then wife, Byland, daughter Fenn, and many other gentlewomen, my special friends, in the great cabin, to kiss his Majesty's hand ; and prevailing with his Majesty to go aft into the cabin, he most graciously gave each his hand to kiss. Then he took barge, and we saluted him with seventy two guns. State Rewards. \u2014 Mr Phineas Pett, with whom we have thus made extensive acquaintance, appears, even beyond his own showing, to have been a good and faithful servant of the nation. His yearly salary, in 1628, was but \u00a354 2s., a mean allowance even in that day, seeing that the master shipwright of the East India Company was at the same time paid \u00a3250. But Mr. Pett had a comfortable residence in the dockyard, and doubtless some privileges. Indeed, it appears that among other marks of the royal favour bestowed on our master shipwright, he enjoyed the disposal of two baronets' patents, one of which he sold for \u00a3700. Mr. Pett was also employed to fit out the fleet which carried over the Princess Elizabeth after her marriage to the Palsgrave in 1613, and accompanied the Lord Admiral in that voyage. In 1623, he went with Prince Charles to Spain, and for his attendance on this voyage he was presented with a gold chain valued at \u00a3104. In 1625, he fitted out the fleet which brought over Henrietta Maria, and attended the voyage. Death of Phineas Pett. \u2014 Mr. Pett was the first master of tbe Shipwrights' Company after their new charter of incorporation in 1612. * The ship was commonly known by her original name, the Royal Sovereign. Evelyn says that on 19th July, 1641, he \"rode to Rochester and Chatham to see the Soveraigne, a monstrous vessel, being for burthen, defence, and ornament, the richest that ever spread cloth before the wind, and especially for this remarkable, that her budding cost his Majestie the affections of his subjects, who quarelled with him for a trifle, refusing to contribute either to their own safety or his glory.\" The ship met the same fate as had befallen the Great Harry, being accidentally burnt at Chatham, January 27th, 1696."], [382, "252 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. He is supposed to have died at Chatham in 1647, for the following entry appears in the register of that parish : \u2014 Phineas Pette, Esquire and Captain, buried August 21st, 1647. More of the Family. \u2014 Phineas had a son, also named Phineas, born in 1618, but this son seems to have died young. His third son, Peter, was shipbuilder at Woolwich in 1633, first assisting and then succeeding his father. He invented the description of ship known as \" the frigate.\" Peter Pett died in 1652,* leaving no family, and was succeeded in charge of this dockyard by his brother Christopher. Captain John Pett was Peter's eldest brother, and had a son whom he named Phineas, which Phineas also in course of time left Phineas the fourth and another Christopher. Of this pair the former was Com missioner of the Navy at Chatham, and the latter was distinguished in his generation at Woolwich. The Petts were a clever and a famous race, but they were not always popular. The following lines by Marvell, written at a time of national chagrin during the Dutch war, refer to a prevalent disposition which existed to throw the blame on tbe shipbuilders : \u2014 All our misfortunes on Pett must fall, His name alone stands sit to answer all : Pett, the sea-architect, in making ships, Was the first cause of all our slips. Remnants of the Race. \u2014 I regret that I have not succeeded in find ing any portraits of the old Petts, and the nearest ap proach I can offer is the presentment of their de scendant, tbe Rev. Phineas Pett, archdeacon, who died Rev. Phineas Pett. at Oxford in 1830. There are many families named Pett at Deptford, hut I am unable to trace any of them to the source from which in every probability they all came. The Dockyard in 1633. \u2014 During the time Peter Pett was * An alabaster monument to the memory of Peter Pett may be seen in St. Nicholas Church, Deptford. He died January 31st, 1652, in his sixtieth year."], [383, "253 WOOLWICH. employed under his father at Woolwich in 1633, he was engaged in assisting to make a very curious and exact survey of the Dockyard, by order of Charles I. The following is the description given : \u2014 By this plotte [plan wanting] is described the situation of the timber yards, the drie dock, and gaUey dock, the master builder and clerk of the cheque's house, and the storehouse between them ; the plancke yard and storehouse betweene it and the cUf, the smith's forge, sawhouses, cranes on the wharf, &c. This yard is enclosed with an high cUf to the southwards, the said houses westward, and the outermoste parte nexte the towne eastwarde, empaled from the clif to the waterside. A pale of nyne foot high and a palUsado upon it were very requisite to be made all alongest the wharfe towards the river, for the better preservation of the outstores from embeseUng. The wharfe without the yarde is much ruyned, and must of necessitie be repaired afore that pightle (a smaU enclosure) of ground without the yard enclosed with a gate from the highwaie ; otherwise in shorte tyme the river wiU eate it out so as no provicions maie be carried by land into or out of the dockyard. Mr. Doctor GUbourne challengeth a small piece of ground, part of the pightle without the yard, to be his land. Ancient Limits. \u2014 This report presents to us a valuable picture of the early dockyard, with its boundary cliff next the high road, and it confirms the belief that the whole yard was originally confined to the low ground at the eastern end, near Church Hill. \" The wharf without the yard \" mentioned in the survey was probably more easterly still. The Privilege of \" Chips.\" \u2014 There have always been complaints of pilfering from the dockyard, and the paling and pallisading, even when complete, offered but a poor protection. And there was pecula tion from within as well as purloining from without, and the system of perquisites, beginning in high quarters, extended down to the humblest of the King's servants. It is about this period that we first hear of the great \" chip \" question. The shipwrights claimed and were allowed to carry away for firewood all the chips they made in their work, and they do not appear to have been very particular in their selection. Such privileges were almost unchecked during this weak and unhappy reign ; but once, when times were hard and chips were short, a daring shipwright loaded a barge with trenails \u2014 small wooden wedges or spikes \u2014 and his cargo was seized by an officer close to the King's yard. This was too much even for a dockyard, and, although the culprit pleaded his right, the officer in charge felt bound to report the circum stance to the higher authorities, but found it needful to offer as his excuse that \" the infinite abuse and prejudice the King has, in most of his yards, under colour of chips, is intolerable. If,\" he adds, \" every carpenter can claim such nails (trenails), the King's purse will deeply waste for it.\" He did not, however, succeed in abolishing the pernicious system. B"], [384, "Oliver Cromwell. CHAPTER XXII. THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE RESTORATION. The Protectorate. \u2014 Always active when the nation is stirred, Woolwich suffered no relapse during the remaining years of Charles's unfortunate monarchy, mainly occupied as they were with the startling events of the civil war. Indeed, we must pass beyond the date of his execution in 1649, to find anything more of note in connection with the dockyard. But as soon as Oliver Cromwell settled down to work he proceeded to overhaul the navy and improve his artillery, both of which efforts necessarily turned his attention hitherward. In 1651 the Admiralty granted timber to make three butts at Woolwich for the trial of ordnance, and there is a note in the State records under date of November 22nd, 1652, which says : \" at Woolwich there is much work.\" It may be observed as an instance of the fidelity to their office ever manifested by the Pett family, that Christopher Pett, who was master shipwright here under Charles I., remained at his post under the Commonwealth. He was paid 20d. per day, but the Protector was generally a year in arrear with his wages. The First Dry Dock. \u2014 This Pett built a great ship called The President, which was launched in 1655, and he appears to have had a"], [385, "255 WOOLWICH. busy time. The Admiralty, to give him more space, hired a room by the waterside, sixty feet by twenty feet, of Captain Hosier, in July, 1653, for the storage of tar ; and in the same year the construction of a dry dock was ordered, at a cost of \u00a3561, with sheds of strong timber in addition. In this year also we find that a master-attendant was appointed, with \u00a3100 a year and a residence. Gunpowder on the Thames. \u2014 The order prohibiting ships containing gunpowder to pass above Woolwich, was made in 1654 by the Council of the State. War with the Dutch. \u2014 Cromwell's period, however, was not, as every reader knows, absorbed by domestic legislation. The Protector had work both for his ships and his soldiers, and we learn that Woolwich had not only to find vessels for the navy, but crews to man them. We were at war with Holland, and the bold Dutchmen were harass ing our merchantmen and threatening our ports. But, on June the 2nd, 1653, the English ships encountered the enemy's fleet and were victorious, sinking and burning twenty sail, and taking several more. The loss was a hundred and twenty men, including brave old General Deane. His body was brought to Woolwich, and thence conveyed for burial, at a cost to the Commonwealth of \u00a3800. Eleven Dutch prizes and one thousand three hundred prisoners were brought up to Woolwich with the body of General Deane. A few days after his death the Dutch met with another severe defeat and sued for peace, one of their pinnaces, carrying a white flag on the mast, sailing up the Thames on June the 23rd. Woolwich was the port from which most of the ships for these engagements were despatched, and its officials were very much worried both in bringing the vessels forward and in supplying them with sailors and soldiers, who at that time did duty as marines. Press-gangs. \u2014 The rigours of the press-gang were in full force, and we read in the year 1654 of Corporal Hastings, of the Victory, at Woolwich, who was engaged with two others in conveying fifteen pressed men in a boat off the dockyard, when the men fell upon their guard and severely wounded the corporal, leaving him half dead. They then steered the boat ashore and escaped. The Government gave to the corporal as compensation \u00a34 10s., and to one of his men, named Welch, who was also wounded, 30s. It was customary to send to this and the other ports the pressed men from various parts of the country. A town would be required to raise a certain number, as it might have raised militia, and it was optional r2"], [386, "256 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. to do this either by forcing unwilling recruits or paying volunteers. In 1652 the parish authorities of Southwold reported : \u2014 We have pressed fourteen men for the navy at 12s. each, and sent them to Woolwich. Our town might have afforded more seamen, but we had eighty in the service before the order came to hand. Only one volunteer came in on the beat of drum, many being gone the week before. Prosperity and Enmity.- \u2014 Under Cromwell we find Woolwich once more taking the leading rank amongst the dockyards, and again we naturally look for attacks upon her premier position. In 1655, when vigorously assailed, she found a strenuous vindicator in Mr. John Packwood, Clerk of the Cheque in the dockyard, who wrote a report to the Admiralty giving his \" reasons for maintaining that it is of greater advantage to the State to have ships fitted out at Woolwich than elsewhere, though some have maintained the contrary.\" Foremost among its antagonists was its own master-attendant, Captain Badiley, who disliked Woolwich from his first appointment to the dockyard, and reported emphatically that there was great danger to ships riding at anchor, as Woolwich was \" a bad road.\" That was his opinion on November 20th, 1655, and on November 26th he followed it up by declaring that the ships afloat were in peril from the ice, while on December 10th he protested that he had had great difficulty in saving the Speaker from sinking after the ice had damaged her. Cromwell either disregarded or discounted these criticisms, or had perhaps more weighty matters to attend to, for he kept Woolwich at work and Badiley to look after it as before, and made no change while he held the reins of the kingdom. Arrears Of Wages.- \u2014 The Commonwealth, however, was no panacea for an impoverished State, and all the taxes which the Govern- ment could levy were insufficient to keep creditors quiet and pay current expenses. In 1655 there were two hundred and seventy-two workmen in Woolwich dockyard, but they were all claimants for wages in arrear ; and at the Restoration, in 1660, William Sheldon presented an estimate of wages due to the men for the previous six months, and found it \u00a39,900, or an average of \u00a338 apiece ! The nation, exhausted and unsettled by internal commotions, was for many years afterwards unable to pay its way, and the records are studded with frequent appeals from the officials and workpeople for the payment of their salaries. There are also, not infrequently, requests to be compen- sated, or re-instated, from sufferers in the civil wars, all of whom, of course, show that they have been loyal to the party in power. In January, 1657, John Bilton, a shipwright, of Woolwich, begged the Commonwealth to give him an appointment, and represented that he"], [387, "257 WOOLWICH. had been a prisoner in the hands of Prince Rupert, \" who would have given him anything to win him to his service,\" but he was always firm to the Parliament and against the Royal party. Changing Colours. \u2014 The same time-serving policy was seen in all departments, and even the ships partook of it. All the royal names were superseded, such titles as The President and The Speaker came into vogue, only to disappear when the monarchy returned. The Naseby was built here, in the time of the Commonwealth, and was named by the Republicans from the battle so fatal to the Royal cause. At the Restoration its name was changed to the Charles, as was the Richard, called after the innocent son of Cromwell, to that of the James. We shall consequently find none of the Cromwellian ships enumerated in the official catalogue. Cromwell and Woolwich. \u2014 Oliver Cromwell, whatever may have been his faults, was a staunch friend to Woolwich, and refused to be blinded by all its calumniators to its advantages as a dockyard. Unlike most naval stations, Woolwich has never had the influence of a powerful patron, there having been in all its history no resident nobleman nor eminent personage with sufficient interest in the place to study its welfare. But, resting entirely upon its merits, it held its supremacy through the whole of the Commonwealth, and therein established the footing which it maintained with more or less success for the next two hundred years. Only One Slip. \u2014 The State declared by an order dated 1650, that there was \" no other dock fit for docking the great ships,\" and for this purpose \"the dock\" at Woolwich was ordered to be kept free. The singular number here employed might be supposed to stand for a yard of several building- slips, but we have proof that there [really was but one slip at this time. This is contained in a recommendation made on December 5th, 1654, for the appointment of Captain Badiley to he master-attendant at Woolwich, in which the argument is, \" there being now two docks there.\" The second of these, as we have just seen (page 255), was a dry dock for repairs, constructed the previous year. Captain Badiley. \u2014 Captain Badiley was not the first master- attendant. That officer was Robert Orchard, appointed at the creation of the post on October 20th, 1653. Badiley afterwards left the dock- yard and led a rover's life at sea, but, after many exploits, he returned to spend his declining years at his old post, where he continued to abuse the place as \" tbe worst reach in the Thames,\" and asked to be relieved of it. This was in 1665, when he was naturally fretting at his cranky"], [388, "258 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. limbs having laid him up in ordinary while the Dutch ships were insulting London. The Hill Boundary. \u2014 Rule and order, as we understand them, had not reached perfection in the seventeenth century. The dockyard was very insecurely protected in 1657, when an order was given to erect \" a fence of waste timber on the hill* against the deal-yard, to prevent embezzlement during the night.\" There had, as we have seen, many times been complaints on this subject, and nearly thirty years earlier (December 7th, 1630) Francis Sheldon, Clerk of the Cheque, complained that only four watchmen were allowed at Woolwich, and they watched by turns. There was also a porter at the gate, but they were all unfurnished with means of defence. \" Within these two nights \" (he says) \" a bark riding close by the dock was surprised by two boats, well manned, who robbed her of her goods, value \u00a340, and escaped undiscovered.\" Loose Supervision. \u2014 Two years subsequent to the Restoration the want of a \" ticket \" system must have impressed itself upon the officials, for an account is given of a number of men and servants who were discovered to be absent when a muster was suddenly called, and all these de faulters were discharged next day. Extra vigilance was apparent in the follow ing year (July 18th, 1663), when to prevent embezzle ment of the stores lying in the yard, a man was set to watch at the gate, for which service threepence night and morning was charged. King Charles II. \u2014 Charles II.'s reign opened inauspiciously at Woolwich. In a letter from Andrew Newport to Sir R. Leveson, dated December 11th, 1660, it is said: \u2014 Charles II. On Saturday night last one of the King's frigates lying at WooUage with the port-holes of the lowest tier of ordnance * The position of this hiU, previously described as \" the cUff,\" is marked by the rising ground in Church Street."], [389, "259 WOOLWICH. open, the seamen being asleep, rolUng by the strength of the great wind, took in so much water at the portholes that she sunk, and the men in her were drowned. At low water she Ues pretty bare, and they have got some of her guns out already, and hope to weigh her up too. This ship was the Assurance, which, according to Captain Badiley's report, was overturned by an extraordinary gust of wind, and drowned twenty men. The sad event is also reported in Mr. Pepys's diary. Probably it is the guns of this ship that are referred to in a minute of the Navy Commissioners of February 25th, 1661, relating to the repair of \" the chain that is broken at Woolwich and taking up the lost guns, lest others may do it.\" Early Extensions. \u2014 It was about this time, the beginning of Charles II. 's reign, that the dockyard began to make some growth. In 1663 additional ground was taken from Dr. Gilbourne on lease for seventeen years. This ground had previously served the purposes of a wharf, and as such had been hired and used by the Govern ment, but it was not found altogether serviceable, and it had to be raised considerably at the water front and filled in from behind with marsh earth. Nevertheless, the owner attached a substantial value to his property, and when the Admiralty were negotiating for a lease he asked, in consideration of his outlay, \u00a31,200 in cash, together with a rent of \u00a3132 per annum for the first six years, and \u00a3182 per annum for the residue of eleven years. Tbe property was described as two ballast quays, two ballast pits, two limekilns, and two tenements, from which description it would appear that the extension was westward. Dimensions in 1663. \u2014 When completed (in 1663) the eastern wharf contained \" in front and at both ends \" water frontages of 397 feet and it was 18 feet deep on its river face. The western wharf contained by similar measurement 375 feet frontage, and the embank ment was 19 feet deep. The Merry Monarch. \u2014 King Charles II. unquestionably took au interest in this dockyard, but it is too certain that his anxieties on its behalf were only such as may be imagined from his frivolous and selfish character. No monarch had ever been such a constant visitor to Woolwich, but the cause of his solicitude was not the war-ships which were to guard his kingdom, but merely tbe building of his pleasure yacht. The correspondence which took place concerning the keel-piece of this precious craft is most elaborate and amusing. The keel-piecu was in the first place a long while coming, and the King was terribly impatient for his toy. At last the keel-piece arrived and was found to be rotten, at which the King was fearfully wroth. Then a new one was built by a man named Graves, who was a long while getting his"], [390, "260 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. money, and bothered the King a good deal. Even when the yacht was finished the trouble did not cease, for Christopher Pett demanded shot to ballast her, and the Admiralty told him to use stones, to which he answered that stones sufficient would half fill the cabins and make the vessel run to leeward. It was represented that the service would suffer if so much of the war stores were devoted to this purpose ; but the king's amusement outweighed the national weal, and he got his ballast \u2014 about forty tons of iron shot and leaden bullets. The yacht cost \u00a31,800, and probably \u00a3200 more for ballast. The Duke of York, brother to the king, also had his yacht built here. Holidays. \u2014 The workmen of the yard were kept so hard at their toil over these and other works that they were denied part of their customary holidays, and on May 12th, 1663, they entreated allowance for a whole day's holiday, as on the previous Gunpowder Plot Day and Coronation Day they worked till noon and had no breakfast-time. They were so busy, indeed, that in this same year, when the East Indian ships had to be docked at Woolwich, men from Deptford were requisitioned to help. Royal Visits. \u2014 There are numerous recorded visits of the King at this period, such as the following : \u2014 1664. September 23rd. \u2014 The King has been to Woolwich to view and hasten the ships. The drums stUl beat for men to go to New Guinea with Prince Rupert. Catharine of Braganza. \u2014 Queen Catharine of Braganza, wife of Charles II. , paid a visit in this same year (1664), which is thus related hy Mrs. Strickland : \u2014 Catharine went with her ladies in her state barge to see a ship launched at Woolwich, October 26th, 1664. The wind and waves were so rough that day, that the Duchess of Buckingham and the fair Mistress Boynton, one of her maids of honour, were as much indisposed as if they had been at sea. The Queen alone felt no incon venience. The King, the Duke of York, and the French Ambassador came in the royal carriages by land. The ship, which was built by Pett, was successfuUy launched, and much admired by the King, who said, \" she had the finest bow that he ever saw ; \" and the French Ambassador gives a Uvely description of the grandeur and beauty of the vessel, which carried seventy guns. Charles behaved very graciously on this occasion to the veteran naval commanders of the Commonwealth who were present. He told the French Ambassador in his jocose way, before them,\" that they had all had the plague, but were now perfectly cured of the malady, and were less likely to have it again than others.\" They then went down to the Nore in the newly launched vessel, and returned in the royal yacht, when they partook of a noble banquet. The King's carriages were tc meet them again at Woolwich. Meantime, a very rough swell came on ; the haU and rain descended in torrents ; every lady but the Queen was sea-sick ; and she, who had come with her ladies from WhitehaU to Woolwich in the royal barge, and was expected to return the same way, played his Majesty and the gentlemen a sly trick, by steaUng on shore with her ladies, and taking possession of the coaches which had been sent for the King and the"], [391, "WOOLWICH. 261 Ambassador, \" making it,\" complains his exceUency \" her pleasure to see the other unfortunates suffering from the effects of the tempest, and not caring what became of us. It was impossible for us to get to London in the barge, and we were obliged to get horses and carriages at Greenwich to take us to Whitehall.\" Strikes for Pay. \u2014 Court affairs, however, did not greatly interest the subjects of Charles II. , and want of faith in the Government was the common failing of all its servants. In 1665 W. Acworth, an officer of the dockyard, reported that \u2014 The Loyal Katherine is at Woolwich, but soldiers ordered for that ship refuse to come on board until their arrears, amounting to \u00a31 3s. 4d. per man, are paid. The arrears were promised as soon as they got on board, but only 120 accepted the promise ; the others did not believe it and went away. In the same year also (October 3rd) Christopher Pett asks authority to \"press caulkers and shipwrights,\" and begs some payment to the workmen on account of their diligence and great distress. Anxious Times. \u2014 At this period, it must be confessed, the need was urgent and the pressure overpowering. The State was poor, and was kept poor by recklessness, extravagance, and vice ; the Great Plague was upon us, and our old foes, the Dutch, smarting under their last punishment, were threatening to ascend the Thames and plunder London. No fewer than 68,596 deaths resulted from the plague in this one year, and many occurred at Woolwich. The Plague. \u2014 On November 10th, Christopher Pett reports that \u2014 He cannot get men to work on the Little Prince, on account of the infection on board, but has ordered the ship to be cleaned, and pitch and tar burnt between decks. He begs consideration for Peter Warner, shipwright, who refused his quarter's pay at the table, but will now be glad to receive it, his family being visited with the plague. Horrors accumulate. \u2014 And all the while the enemy thundering at the gate. Read the following extracts from tbe official records of this unhappy year : \u2014 1665. September. \u2014 Abstract of letter from Christopher Pett to the Navy Commis sioners : \u2014 The plague increases in the town and many of the workmen are dead.

The EngUsh fleet is ordered to fall down to the Nore. Sheerness and the Nore War, Pestilence, and Famine. \u2014 At no period of our history have tbe afflictions of our people been so heavy to bear. Toiling night and day, with barely sufficient wages to buy bread, worn out with tending the sick, cast down with sorrow for the dead, and all the while in daily peril of being trodden under tbe heel of an invader, our artisan population was in the very depths of misery.

Dutch ships in our river, but war had also been declared against us by Denmark ; and France, joining in the attempt to crush the power of England, had a menacing squadron of forty ships in the Channel. The Enghsh navy was, however, resolute and strong, and some victories were achieved close to our shores which proved very disas trous and discouraging to our foes, many of whose ships were sunk or captured. Prisoners of War. \u2014 Victory, however, was not without its alloy at Woolwich, as it was here that the conquering Prince Rupert sent most of his prisoners to be housed and fed. In the latter part of 1665 three ships laden with Dutch captives, one alone containing six hundred, were brought to Woolwich in company with numerous prizes, and the workmen of the dockyard found ample employment in fitting and arming the enemy's ships for future use. But the prisoners were a painful encumbrance, and sickness was rife among them. Vain efforts were put forth to beat away the plague. Sailors were forbidden to go to London, and their wives were not allowed to visit them, several having been seen in the streets \" with plague-spots about them.\" It was deemed so unsafe to procure clothing from the infected district that our soldiers and sailors were in rags, and all the while the plague came steadily on. John Evelyn. \u2014 At this juncture the Government called upon Mr. Evelyn to act as Commissioner for the sick and wounded and prisoners in Kent, and, deserting the pleasure and safety of bis country seat, he established himself in the thick of his work at Deptford, and nobly set about the fulfilment of his trust. He found his charges in all the towns and villages which lie between Chatham and London, and all that man could do for the alleviation of their sufferings they owed to his tender hand and gentle influence. At Woolwich the Loyal Katherine, before mentioned, was furnished as a hospital ship, and lay off the town full of sick and wounded men, and urgent appeals for help from such as Evelyn awoke the charitable heart of England. On October 3rd, 1665, Evelyn wrote to Pepys from Say es Court, Deptford, as follows : \u2014 At Woolwich they refuse to take the sick and wounded men from the com manders in ships, on pretence of a fear of contagion, whUe they in the meanwhile suffer others to tipple in the alehouse ; and Sir TheophUus Biddulph wishes to spare Greenwich, because of your sitting there, and Deptford, in regard of his Majesty's yard. I would be glad to know, since Chatham and Gravesend can hold no more, and that I have peopled all the intermediate villages, what I shall do with these miserable creatures. I have the importunity of a thousand clamours at my doors, which neither lets me rest day nor night. A.D. 1666. \u2014 Winter came and mercifully prevailed over the plague,"], [394, "264 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. and in January, 1666, the visitation had so much abated that the King, who had fled from London, found courage to return. One of his first acts was a judicious command that the Dutch prisoners should be allowed to go on shore on parole from the ships at Woolwich and work at their trades for a subsistence, which the poor fellows, \"being in great necessity,\" were only too happy to do. The agreement with them stipulated that they should work for board wages, but within a fortnight the \" foreign shipwrights \" were petitioning for their wretched pay, and Christopher Pett was more than ever perplexed by pecuniary complications. His carpenters intimated that they should not work much longer for \" twelvepence per day,\" and he was at his wit's end for money to pay them even so much. The Fire of London. \u2014 The same year (1666), to complete the consensus of tribulations, the Great Fire of London occurred. This, with the plague and the war, created such dire distress, despair, and recklessness, that the Kent Militia were called out to preserve order and prevent crime. Providentially, the herring fishery was very abundant this year, and it was said here that \" twelve herrings a penny filled many a belly.\" Another agreeable feature of a terrible year was the loyalty of the North American colonists, who, to help their country against her foes, sent over from New England, to Woolwich, two masts one hundred feet long as a present to Charles II. from Massachusetts. Invasion. \u2014 But the war continued and extended, the Dutch, elated by some successes, growing more and more audacious. By the summer of 1667 they had made all their arrangements for an invasion, and came down on us with the vehemence of a hail-storm. The follow ing are some of the dockyard reports at this crisis : \u2014 1667- June 15th. \u2014 Captains Lake and Burke report that they have sunk their ships at Woolwich. Sir F. HoUis publishes a further order for sinking six ships at Woolwich, and eight hoys with four guns each, and 4,000 tons of stones in the ships. June 17th. \u2014 Sir F. Hollis was ordered to send down to Gravesend aU the fireships under his command, in company with the frigates under Sir W. Jennings to support the men making the fortifications, and \" to continue there unless he finds the enemy near and too strong, in which case he is to retreat and come up the river.\" Signed by Sir W. Batten, and dated at Woolwich, June 17th, 1667. June 18th. \u2014 Christopher Pett reports being actively employed planting ordnance in the town and yard ; the men working night and day fitting out fireships, &c, and cannot hold out much longer. 1667.

A hundred sail of the enemy are at the Nore. June 29th. \u2014 The Dutch Fleet of 120 sail still roves between the Gun Fleet and the Downs, and two days ago came into the river, within five mUes of Gravesend, which"], [395, "265 WOOLWICH. gave a fright, Woolwich and Chatham being unprovided. If they had had the courage to come on shore when they got to Chatham they might have spoiled all that was in the river, up to the Tower. Sir Edward Spragg, vice-admUal, now defends Woolwich. The Town in Peril. \u2014 It was a gloomy outlook, indeed, for the whole kingdom, and especially for the inhabitants of the riverside towns of Gravesend and Woolwich, at either one of which the enemy, if he had effected a landing, would probably have commenced his ravages. The Dutch had already captured Sheerness and sailed about the Lower Hope, but, leaving the Thames, had proceeded up tbe Med way to attack Chatham, where tbe terrible De Ruyter not only broke an iron chain stretched across the stream, but actually passed over the twelve sunken ships by which the Duke of Albemarle attempted to check his advance. Fireships destroyed a number of King Charles's vessels in Chatham Harbour, and then De Ruyter, scarcely damaged, fell back upon the Thames, with the evident intention of extending his hostilities by tbe next tide to Woolwich, if not even to London Bridge. Everywhere in this locality the utmost alarm prevailed, and families fled from their homes, crying, \" We are betrayed, let it light where it will.\"* For want of ready money Parliament had paid off our clamorous seamen with tickets bearing interest. Many of these men joined the enemy in disgust, and were heard to call out from on board the Dutch fleet : \" We fought for tickets before, now we fight for dollars. We have come for tbe money for our tickets.\" Peace. \u2014 It is due to the good sense and moderation of the French king at this critical time, rather than to any virtues of the English Government, that the ruin of the nation was averted. France had no desire to push matters to extremities. She had put a check upon the supremacy of the English navy by playing off the Dutchmen, and, being satisfied, she recalled her allies. England was only too glad to conclude a discreditable war by a dishonourable peace, and a treaty which sullies our whole history was signed on the 10th of July. A poem published at this time, supposed to have been written by Sir Jobn Denham, and entitled \"Advice to a Painter,\" contains the following trenchant lines : \u2014 \" Painter, let thine art describe a story Shaming our warUke island's ancient glory ; Make the Dutch fleet, wlule we supinely sleep, Without opposers, masters of the deep ; Make them securely the Thames's mouth invade, At once depriving us of that and trade ; * Letter of John Rushworth."], [396, "266 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Draw Woolwich, Deptford, London, and the Tower Meanly abandoned to a foreign power ; Yet turn their first attempt another way, And let their cannons upon Sheerness play ; Their canvas sweUing with a prosperous gale, Swift as our fears make them to Chatham sail.\" Consequences. \u2014 The effects of the peace upon Woolwich, with which we are chiefly concerned at present, were a glut of ships, soldiers, and sailors, and a sudden stoppage of work. We note the following report from Barking Reach : \u2014 1667, July 24th. \u2014 Captain J. Pearce is ready to saU, but wants sixty lusty soldiers who may be sent on board his ship at the Halfway Tree, in two hours, Woolwich being full of them. The Sunken Ships. \u2014 Directly the war was over the King was once more bothered by claimants for justice. The ships which had been sunk at Woolwich in such frantic haste were the first which came to hand, and amongst them was a French vessel sent to fetch prisoners by exchange from Woolwich. The master of this ship, which was described as a fly-boat of four hundred and forty tons, was Jean Kerkhoven, and he now sent in a demand in which he stated that he was employed by the French king to proceed from Dunkirk for prisoners, and that he had on board provisions for three hundred men, but that his boat was sunk with all in it by tbe English king's Commissioners \" on approach of the Hollanders.\" He therefore asked for the restoration of his vessel, or another in its place, which he doubtless received, for Charles appears to have been, like most spend thrifts, as prodigal in satisfying his creditors as in getting into debt. The sunken ships were soon raised, and in July, 1667, the Earl of Anglesey, Treasurer of the Navy, paid \u00a3300 for \" weighing the ships lately sunk at Woolwich and Blackwall,\" but they must have been considerably the worse for their immersion, and appear to have been taken altogether off their owners' hands. What ultimately became of them may be inferred from the following minutes in the Admiralty books : \u2014 1667. Aug. \u2014 Captain Sinunonds, late commander of the Exhibition frigate, petitions the King for an old fireship of small value lately sunk at Woolwich. He had dUigently served under Prince Rupert at Woolwich and Sheerness since the Dutch came on the coast, and had .\u00a33000 of his personal property taken from him by De Ruyter. Sept. 7th. \u2014 The widow of Phineas Pett* (slain in the Tiger, May 2nd, 1666) peti tions the King for one of the old ships lately sunk at Woolwich, as her husband left her in debt and there is \u00a3380 due to her on a broad seal of the late king. * Son of Captain John Pett, and grandson of the great and original Phineas Pett. (See page 252.)"], [397, "267 WOOLWICH. Fortification of Woolwich. \u2014 Although there were protests against the unprotected state of Woolwich during the peril of war, some attempt was certainly made to fortify and defend it, for which purpose timber from the dockyard was taken to the other extremity of the town, where the earthworks were constructed and the guns were mounted. The King himself came down to see the progress of these works on May 28th, 1667. This part ofthe subject will have to be referred to hereafter. The war finished, the dockyard almost collapsed, and, as early as the August following, Christopher Pett entreated the King for money or timber to carry on the works, as \" the workmen and their families are in great necessity, and many sick and perishing in the town for want.\" Almost at the same time he pressed for the return of \" the timber lent to the Ordnance for fortifying the town,\" and to this extent he was satisfied so soon as the earthworks were dismantled, but he did not greatly succeed in improving the condition of his workmen. Forced Lahour. \u2014 And yet, though the exchequer was bankrupt, and the State compelled to pay its creditors by giving them old ships, the King contrived to carry out a project upon which he had set his mind, the building of a \" mast and reed-house* \" in Woolwich Dock yard, even though he had to accomplish his design by forced labour : \u2014 1667. Sept. 10th.\u2014 Chris. Pett reports that he has pressed several carpenters for carrying on the mast and reed-house, but they have got discontented and most of them have left work. He suggests that two or three ofthe ringleaders shall be clapped into the Marshalsea and severely punished. Several of the caulkers are also absent, and he asks that the Admiralty marshal shall force them to work or carry them to prison. Sept. 16th. \u2014 Christopher Pett replies to a letter from the Navy Commissioners in which they ask him, in the names of his Royal Highness and the Council, to lend money for paying the fleet. He says that he is Ukely to lose _\u00a3500 which he has paid aUeady for timber, and that he is so meanly paid that he can hardly keep his famUy. He has been twenty years in the place and has eleven chUdren. Oct. \u2014 Chris. Pett reports that he cannot get on for want of tar, but has borrowed a little from the ropeyard. Most of the sawyers are sick or dead, and aU the men are much discouraged for want of money. Kingly Toothache. \u2014 Ships, however, had to be provided whether there were money and tar or whether there were not, and the King seems to have done his best by his personal supervision and encourage ment to compensate for the deficiency of supplies.

PEPYS AT WOOLWICH, The Prince of Diarists. \u2014 Our share of the gratitude which all posterity will owe to the memory of Samuel Pepys, the Admiralty official, who has left us such a delightful diary of the times in which he lived,* is by no means small, for Pepys resided with his family at Woolwich for a time, and makes some interesting allusions to the place in connection with the Plague, the Fire, and the Dutch invasion. It is probable that Pepys Uved at a house in the dockyard while he was absent from his town residence, which was near to the Tower of London, and close to the spot known as Barking Churchyard. His diary, which is written in all the secrecy and sincerity of cipher, contains the following references to Woolwich : \u2014 The \"Assurance\" Capsized. \u2014 We are first mentioned in connec tion with the accident to the ship Assurance, of which we have been told \u2014 1660.

July 26th. \u2014 To Greenwich, where the King and Duke are come by water this morn from Hampton Court. They asked me several questions. The King having dined, I went in the barge with him down to Woolwich, and there I just saw and kissed my wife, and saw some of her painting, which is very curious, and away again to the King, and back again with him in the barge. Aug. 21st. \u2014 Messengers went to get a boat for me to carry me to Woolwich, but aU to no purpose ; so I was forced to walk it in the darke, with SU J. Minne's George* with me, for fear of the doggs at Coome farme,t and more for fear of rogues by the way. Aug. 28th. \u2014 I think to take adieu to London streets. In much the best posture I was ever in in my Use, both as to the quantity and the certainty I have of the money I am worth, having most of it in my hand. But then this is a trouble to me what to do with it, being myself this day going to be wholly at Woolwich, but for the present I am resolved to venture it in an Uon chest.

Sept. 17th. \u2014 There is dead of the plague one of my own watermen, who carried me daUy. Fell sick as soon as he had landed me on Friday morning. Oct. 26th. \u2014 At Woolwich ; I there went up to the King and Duke. Here I staid above with them while the ship was launched, which was done with great success ; and the King did very much like the ship, saying she had the very best bow he ever saw. By and by the Queene comes and her maids of honour ; one whereof, Mrs. Boynton, and the Duchess of Buckingham, had been very sick coming by water in the barge (the water being very rough) ; but what siUy sport they made with them, in very common terms, methought was very poor, and below what people think these i^reat people do. The launching being done, the King and company went down to take barge, and I sent for Mr. Pett (he had built the ship), and put the flagon into the Duke's hand, and he in the presence of the King, did give it to Mr. Pett, taking it npon his knee. The Plague at Woolwich. \u2014 It is not remarkable that Woolwich had a share in the plague, for it spread far and wide.

Coventry to have the Duke of York's permission to puU down houses rather than lose this office, which would much hinder the King's business. So Sir W. Penn wrote down this night in order to the sending them up to-morrow morning. Sept. 5th. \u2014 1 lay down in the office, being mighty weary.

There, when I come, I found the gates shut, but no guard kept at all, which troubled me. I got the gates open and to Mr. Sheldon's, where I locked up my gold and charged my wife and W. Hewer never to leave the room without one of them in it night or day. Sept. 7th. \u2014 Blessed be God, all well. . . .

A Woolwich Hermit. \u2014 We shall probably never know more than the next entry tells us in regard to an interesting hermit who dwelt, we may conjecture, in Hanging Wood. June 14th. \u2014 At dinner we discoursed of Tom of the Wood, a feUow that lives Uke a hermit near Woolwich, who, as they say, did foreteU the burning of the city, and now says that a greater desolation is at hand. . . . At night come home SUW. Batten and W.

But strange our confusion !

It has been conjectured that they were laid in a line across the channel opposite the site of the T pier of the Royal Arsenal, but it is more probable that the position marked by the town pier was selected, for the river there is narrower, and Pepys tells us that Prince Rupert's fortifications at the Warren were \" below the sunken ships.\" t Mr. WUUam Bodham had charge of the Ropeyard."], [409, "275 WOOLWICH. the ships that are sunk, but not above them.

James's short and troublous reign of three years tended only to make matters worse, and on bis abdication and flight down the Thames in 1688, William III., Prince of Orange, and Mary his wife, came to tbe inheritance of a bankrupt exchequer. After a time prospects began to mend, but not too rapidly, nor at any time, it is feared, to the King's complete satisfaction. Shish, Father and Son. \u2014 Among the MSS. of this century are letters and reports from Thomas Shish, who was master-shipwright at Woolwich in succession to his father Jonas, who was, I suppose, successor to tbe Pett6. In the churcb of St. Nicholas, Deptford, is a grey marble monument inscribed to \u2014 \"Jonas Shish, Esq., master-shipwright to King Charles II. of His Majesty's yards at Deptford and Woolwich, who dep.arted this life May the 7th, 1680, in the seventy fifth year of his age Also John, his eldest son, master-shipwright of Deptford, died Oct. 16th, 1686, aged forty-three ; and Thomas, the third son, master-shipwright of Woolwich, died Dec. 6th, 1685, aged thirty-seven years.\" * See Plate XXVIII. tMr. Evelyn says in his diary under June 18th, 1667 : \"Alarmed by the Dutch, who were fallen on our fleete at Chatham, went to see the work at Woolwich \u2014 a battery to prevent them from coming up to London, which Prince Rupert com- manded, and sunk some ships in the river.\" Throughout his copious diary this is the only mention the accomplished author of \" Sylva \" makes of Woolwich, though he lived at Deptford and performed responsible functions under the State. He makes however, a casual reference to the place in the letter mentioned at page 263."], [410, "276 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. The Unpaid Workmen. \u2014 Woolwich Dockyard had an uneventful time under the Shishes, but we always find that the workmen were in straits for their wages, whoever was shipwright or whoever was king. There is a petition, dated 20th December, 1694, from the shipwrights and other workmen in Woolwich and Deptford yards, complaining that their wages were twelve months in arrear ; and another document making a similar complaint to the Treasury in May, 1697. Again, in 1710, came a memorial from the shipwrights and ropemakers objecting to be paid in Queen Anne's Exchequer Bills, and asking for \" six months' more wages.\" And then we find a state paper of June 30th, 1712, stating that the Commissioners of the Navy had agreed to discharge about four hundred workmen from Woolwich and Deptford, and demand ing about \u00a312,000 to pay them off. At the same time they announced their intention of making reductions at Chatham, Sheerness, Ports mouth, and Plymouth, \" the workmen being in a very miserable condition, and a year and three quarters in arrear.\" Under such a financial system as this it was impossible to carry on the public works in a creditable or economical manner, and there was continual trouble and delay in tbe course of business. Coercion. \u2014 Occasionally, to encourage the others, mechanics and labourers who refused to work without pay were seized and flogged, put in the stocks, or pressed into the navy, but it cannot truthfully be said that either William III. or his two successors quite succeeded in solving the fiscal difficulty. As recently as 1739, upon November 5th, a battalion of the Guards and a troop of cavalry marched from London to Woolwich to \" quiet the workmen in that yard,\" who had \" mutinied about their pay and refused to work ;\" but we do not hear of any more complaints of arrears after this, and may suppose that under the better management of the Brunswickers the nation had contrived to get along without a running debt with its artisans and labourers. Improvements. \u2014 Yet William was a wise and fairly prudent sovereign, and one of his early measures was to strengthen the navy and improve the dockyards. Woolwich yard, which had been patched and pieced many times during the preceding hundred and fifty years, had by this time extended to a length of eight hundred feet, stretching westward to \" The Row of Trees,\" which stood in the recess by the Black Eagle tavern.* The trees, which were ten in number, are shown in a plan of the dockyard drawn by Milton in 1753, and partly copied on page 278. William, however, set himself the rather to improve the efficiency of the dockyard than to enlarge it, and although he took in * This spot was still known as \" The Row of Trees \" by old inhabitants forty years ago, and some of the trees were standing at the beginning of this century."], [411, "Woolwich in 1798.

In that year an Act of Parliament was passed to acquire \" land and wharf near the dockyard,\" which was sold by Bowater to the Royal Navy Commissioners for the sum of \u00a33,299 10s. This addition carried the dockyard as far as the pre sent main gate, which was two hundred feet beyond the former boundary. The new officers' quarters (or \" lodg ings \" as they were called), were built, and the yard, though but half its present size, was thought to have extended far enough. It George II. was bounded westward by the road leading from the sandpits (now Dockyard Station) to the Sand Quay, by meadows, and by marsh. The number of building slips increased to seven, but none were permanently covered until long afterwards. The gate was still at Church Hill, but there was a second entrance next the officers' quarters. More Additions. \u2014 The rapid growth of the navy, however, more than kept pace with the dockyards. Before many years more space was demanded, and it was noted as a special defect of Woolwich yard that it had no room for the storage of timber, nor convenience for the number of workmen. But so it went on fifty years, when (in 1784) the Mast Pond, two new slips for building ships of the line, and new storehouses were added, and part of Mr. Harden's farm on the west appears to have been at the same time purchased of the Bowaters. The ground taken for the new erections was enclosed with high thick walls, which, on account of the marshes, were piled under the foundations.

It is copied from a very large oil painting by Proctor, now exhibited in the Royal Naval Hospital at Greenwich, and dated 1798. The eastern end of the yard was much as it now is, but to the west, although a large space has been added, and the present main gate substituted for the old one, the new building slips had not been constructed, nor had the area which was afterwards excavated for the new basins and graving dock been included.

The ship had been slightly careened over, by shifting the guns to windward, in order to get at and repair a pipe below the water-line on the other side, when a sudden gust of wind washed the sea into her ports, and, in the words of the poet Cowper \u2014 \" Down went the Royal George, With twice four hundred men.\" There were said to have been about twelve hundred people on board, of whom three hundred were saved; but tbe estimates which have been made of the loss of life varies to any extent between five hundred and one thousand.

The wreck lay in not very deep water, but there it was left unmolested for fifty-seven years ; during which time, however, many proposals were made to raise or destroy the hulk. By the use of the diving bell a survey was made in 1817, but nothing practical was done until 1839, when the Royal Sappers and Miners from Woolwich and Chatham undertook to blow up the vessel by gunpowder, which was accomplished (in fragments), between that year and 1842, under the direction of Sir Charles Paislev.

THE LATER DAYS OF THE DOCKYARD. Arctic Expeditions. \u2014 Woolwich has been the starting-point of expeditions from the earliest times to the latest, and has prepared for many of the daring adventures in which brave Britons have risked and given up their lives, including most of the enterprises undertaken in the hope of finding the long- wished- for northern passage to India. Mr. Phineas Pett, in the reign of James I., fitted out an early Arctic expedition, for upon the North-West Passage his young master Henry, Prince of Wales, had set his heart. It consisted of two ships, the Resolution and Discovery, which sailed in April, 1612, but did not return until after the Prince's untimely death in November, 1612. Sir John Franklin. \u2014 Perhaps the most remarkable and most calamitous of Arctic explorations was that undertaken by Sir John"], [420, "282 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Franklin and his brave companions in the summer of 1845* Her Majesty's ships Erebus and Terror were placed at his command, and were fitted out with great care at Woolwich, under the direction of Sir John himself. He had previously made three voyages to the Arctic seas, and this time he was to attempt to circum navigate America. The Erebus and Terror were, like their com mander, seasoned to the work. They had both been engaged in the South Polar Expedition in 1839-1843, under the command of Captain Sir James Ross. The Terror had previously visited the Arctic regions, being the vessel in which Sir George Back, in 1836, attempted by \"way of Sir John Franklin. Wager River,\" to trace the northern boundary of tbe American con tinent, but, after encountering extraordinary perils among the ice, she was compelled to return home in 1837. This was the fifty-seventh Arctic expedition from England, commencing with Cabot's voyage (temp. Henry VII.), and Sir John Franklin's was the fifty-eighth. The vessels were put in commission at Woolwich on Tuesday, March 4th, and sailed on Monday, May 17th. Sir John Franklin was appointed to the Erebus (the larger vessel), with Commander James Fitzjames, Lieutenant Henry J. D. de Vescoute ; mate, Charles H. Des Voux ; second master, H. F. Collins ; clerk, G. F. Pinhorn ; gunner, J. G. Robinson ; boatswain, J. G. Terry ; carpenter, W. Weekes. Captain F. R. M. Crosier commanded the Terror, with Lieu tenant Edward Little, and Lieutenant G. H. Hodgson ; carpenter, Thomas Honey. The provisions embarked were considerable, and consisted of pre served provisions of various kinds, a large quantity of tea, and extra strong West Indian rum, 35 per cent, over proof. The consumption was provided for a prolonged expedition. Ten fine live oxen also were shipped at the Woolwich Dockyard on board the Barretto, hired trans port ship, which accompanied the discovery vessels to the edge of * Many of the Arctic explorers, including Franklin himself, were weU known at Woolwich.

Each ship was supplied with two hundred tin cylinders for the pur pose of holding papers to be thrown overboard, with the statement of the longitude and other particulars worthy of record, written in six different languages. Lost in the Ice. \u2014 From the time when the tender left the ships in tbe north seas, not one of their brave crews (in number one hundred and thirty-five, all told), was ever seen alive, so far as we know, by any but themselves. As time passed the most intense anxiety was felt for them in England, and several relief expeditions were sent out by the Government, by Lady Franklin, and others. Departure of Sir J. Ross, 1848. \u2014 Sir James Ross, with the Enterprise and Investigator, left Woolwich the 12th of June, 1848, and returned November, 1849. Sir Edward Belcher's expedition sailed Departure of Captain Ross, 1848, from Woolwich 15th April, 1852, Belcher being in the Enterprise, and having with him the Resolute, Captain Eellett ; North Star, Captain Pullen ; Intrepid, Captain McClintock ; and Pioneer, Captain Sherard Osborn. This expedition was likewise disastrous, and Captain Belcher and his party only saved themselves by abandoning their _,_iips and meeting with rescuers, May, 1854. It was afterwards ascertained by Captain McClintock, of the Fox, that the two ships were beset by ice on September 12th, 1846. Franklin died June 11th, 1847, and the ships were abandoned April"], [422, "284 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 22nd, 1848. The whole of the officers and crew are believed to have perished in that year. Royal Emharkations. \u2014 Much of this history being made up, after the manner of histories in general, of the doings of Royalty, it may be remarked that, until the present happy reign, Woolwich was not much thought of by the ruling monarch as a port for embarkation. The favourite places were either London or Blackwall, Gravesend or Dover. A newspaper of August 12th, 1822, reports that when George IV. went to Scotland in that year he embarked at Blackwall in the steam yacht Royal George, and tells us that \u2014 His Majesty was standing on deck opposite the town of Woolwich, and was wel comed hy a royal salute from the hatteries, and three sloops of war that happened to be stationed there. The yards of these vessels were manned, and aU theU different flags were flying. The saUors cheered when the King passed them, as did also the workmen in the dockyards and pubUc works. At two of them a large flag was dis played, on which was inscribed, \" Long live King George the Fourth.\" At the arsenal, the Artillery, the Sappers and Miners, a regiment of infantry (the Buffs, we beUeve), and a troop of cavalry were drawn out at the water's edge to meet his Majesty. The standard of England was hoisted on the church. Royal Early Rising. \u2014 Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were, however, several times at the Dockyard, it being their point of departure for Scotland and the Continent, in the early years of their marriage. Both possessing the royal virtue of early rising, the Dock yard and Garrison officials were careful on these occasions not to oversleep themselves. For instance, we are told that on \u2014 August 29th, 1843. \u2014 The Queen and Prince Albert embarked for Scotland at ten minutes to 7 a.m., having driven down from London. They were conveyed in a pinnace from the Dockyard StaUs to the royal yacht George, and there was a great multitude present and great enthusiasm. The Queen wore a blue silk dress, a white sUk bonnet, and a splendid Paisley shawl. September, 8th 1844. \u2014 The Queen and Prince Albert embarked at Woolwich Dockyard for Scotland on board the royal yacht Victoria and Albert. The Queen wore court mourning. On one of these occasions, when Victoria and her consort were accompanied by their children, the Princess Royal and Prince of Wales, the street ballad girls sang : \u2014 We'll sing so keen, God save the Queen, Her husband and her son and daughter ; She sails away from Woolwich town To visit Scotland o'er the water. So noble looks the River Thames, Thousands will be on the water To see old England's blooming Queen From Woolwich town take her departure ;"], [423, "285 WOOLWICH. She gives command, and off she goe: To where some noble friends wiU mind her ; She bids adieu to Woolwich town \u2014 That pretty spot she leaves behind her. The \"Trafalgar.\" \u2014 The presence ofthe Queen and Prince Albert at some important launches was also the occasion of much excitement, in testimony of which I present a short report of the launch of the Trafalgar, 120 guns, on June 21st, 1841 : \u2014 Of all the sights w*hich have attracted pleasure-seekers within the last twelve years, none wiU be recorded as having produced greater interest than the launch of the Trafalgar. The roads from London swarmed with carriages and pedestrians \u2014 coaches and four by dozens, coaches and paU by hundreds ; barouches, gigs, phaetons innumerable ; coronets and mitres, rich hammercloths emblazoned in silver, the more humble carriages, and the patent cab, passed before the eye in incessant Une. Launch of the \" Trafalgar,\" 1841. Almost every shop in Woolwich was closed. From fifty to a hundred steamers aud yachts carried joyous freights of people on the river, and if ever there was lUe upon the waters it was that day. The Queen, accompanied by Prince Albert and an immense suite, alighted at a stage covered with green cloth for her soft feet to tread upon, she in whom were centred aU the nation's hopes \u2014 \" The fondly reared, the faU, Gladdening all eyei to see.\" Her Majesty wore a bright blue silk dress and a white drawn bonnet with roses. Prince Albert also looked very well \u2014 pale, as he always does, but certainly with no symptoms of consumption. The bottle of wine with which the christening was performed was one of those which Nelson had on board the Victory at the battle of Trafalgar. Lady Bridporfe, Nelson's niece, performed the ceremony. Nelson's sister, Mrs. Matcham, was also present, and the survivors of the memorable battle. As the dogshores were knocked away the great leviathan gUded slowly and majestically off the stocks, amid thunders of applause and the booming of guns. To this we may add Longfellow's elegant lines : \u2014 \" She starts, she moves, she seems to feel The thrill of life along her keel ; T"], [424, "286 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. And, spurning with her foot the ground, With one exulting joyous bound She leaps into the water's arms.\" \" The Royal Albert.\" \u2014 Another royal launch of especial note was that of the Royal Albert, on Saturday, May 13th, 1854, when the Queen, accompanied by her consort, the Princess Royal, the Prince of Wales, Prince Alfred, and the Duchess of Kent, was present in the midst of sixty thousand spectators. England and Russia were at the beginning of the war, and the bombardment of Odessa had just drawn peculiar attention to tbe Navy, to which the Royal Albert was now to be added as an important member. The royal party arrived by road punctually at one o'clock, and were received by a guard of honour Launch ofthe \"Royal Albert,\" 1854, composed of the cadets from the Royal Military Academy. The Queen christened the ship with a bottle of wine at the third attempt, and the launch was successfully accomplished. The Last Extension. \u2014 The completion of the Dockyard, as we now see it, was not accomplished until 1843, but several additions were made by purchase from tbe Bowater estate * during the earlier part of the century, the extension works being, as usual, carried out by convict labour. Tbe ground joined on at the west was for a long while * See plan, page 60."], [425, "AVOOLWICH. 287 enclosed for the most part by merely a wooden palisading, and on the 10th of April, 1840, we read \u2014 This morning at eight, one of the convicts in the dockyard escaped during a heavy fog, by pulUng out one of the paUngs bounding the Greenwich Road. The sentry was within a few yards of him and fired his gun, loaded with baU. The whole of the dockyard ought to be surrounded with a high wall. [The man was captured two days afterwards in a field at Charlton.] The progress of the extension works which formed the Albion Road (see page 60) was thus recorded in \u2014 Queen Victoria christening the \"Royal Albert.\" November, 1842. \u2014 For some time past a body of labourers have been engaged in making a new road on the southward of the present Woolwich and Greenwich road, which when completed will be substituted for the old road. The latter will then be broken up and enclosed, with several acres of land, as part of the dockyard. About twenty-five respectable cottages, situated between the dockyard and fields, will be pulled down to carry out the order. This step has been necessary in order to erect numerous workshops for the engineers and miUwrights. The Height of its Glory. \u2014 This final extension of the Dockyard was accomplished by the end of 1843, and was tbe largest, both in extent and expenditure, of all the series. It took, as just stated, the public road, together with rows of cottages on each side of it, and all the space between the road and the river as far as Trinity Street. It included the immense graving dock, the great basins, and the new building slips. The steam-engine factory, the mast house, and many other buildings were erected on the new ground, and the triple iron shed was considered a masterpiece of engineering skill. The Dockyard by this additional area was enlarged to fifty-six acres, and had a river frontage of 3,680 feet. The old dry dock at the eastern end was the largest in existence until the new graving dock was built at the western extension. The contractors, Messrs. Grissel and Peto, were paid \u00a380,000 for this work, and they finished it in 1843. The steam-engine factory was built in 1839. t2"], [426, "288 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. The Allied Sovereigns. \u2014 Even prior to this improvement, the mother dock was pronounced superior to any other in the kingdom. _. 1814, when the allied sovereigns were at Woolwich, they saw both the Arsenal and the Dockyard, and the Emperor Alexander of Russia exclaimed, \" Good Heavens ! You seem to have preparations for another twenty years' contest, instead of being exhausted with that which you have just concluded.\" The wharf was built in 1818 on a new line of frontage, partly on account of dilapidations and partly to check the accumulation of mud, the dredging of which had cost in ten years the large sum of \u00a3125,692, and threatened to render the yard useless. And thus the old Dockyard, which had been so long and constantly abused, attacked, and menaced, grew in size and strength and value, and was in its fullest vigour within our own time. But the day of its pride Launch of Uu \" Agamemnon\" 1854. was the eve of its fall. Although of venerable age, it had no period of infirmity or decay. Its history, down to the very close, was one of unceasing activity and progress. During the war of 1815 the number of artificers and labourers was between three and four thousand, and even its peace establishment was fifteen hundred, a number which was ultimately increased, but not to a very large extent. In 1847, when Mr. Ruegg published his \" Rambles,\" he stated that the rise of a steam navy had established the steam engine factory, which employed a thousand men and boys, and that the Dockyard was at that time \"the leading establishment of the town.\" The Crimean War. \u2014 During the war with Russia in 1854-5, the place was again abnormally active, there being employed no fewer than eleven hundred and fifty shipwrights and seven hundred engineers, irrespective of other artisans and labourers, probably in all nearly three"], [427, "WOOLWICH. 289 thousand, but the number fell off again when peace was restored, and iii-_.865 we find the following to have been the full strength : \u2014 Established shipwrights, 440, with 50 apprentices and 150 hired men ; caulkers, 29, and 10 apprentices ; joiners, 68, with 3 apprentices and 6S hired ; smiths, 101, 3 apprentices and 115 hUed ; millwrights, 5, and 18 hUed ; sawyers, 22 at the pits and 20 at the sawmills ; riggers, 48 ; sailmakers, 14 ; and labourers, 520. Total, 1,684. The End. Even at this time there was little apprehension of the impending doom. Warnings and forebodings had indeed been heard, but they were only of the customary kind, and nobody heeded them. For at least twenty years the Dockyard had been told that it was to be extinguished, un til the cry of \" Wolf ! \" only provoked a smile, and the old \" Yard \" reposed in fancied security until the day of its death. But the end came in 1869, and the bell rang the workmen out for the last time on September 18th. The Thalia, the last ship built here, was launched on the 13th of Woolwich Dockyard Gates closed, September 18th, 1869. July previous. Most of the machinery and some of the buildings were removed to Chatham, where two of the great structures which once sheltered the ships in progress at this dockyard are to be seen to-day labelled \"The Woolwich Sheds.\" Deptford Dockyard and some smaller establishments were closed at the same time. Who Closed the Dockyard ? \u2014 Who closed Woolwich Dockyard ? is a question that has been asked of politicians hereabout more often than any other, and has never been satisfactorily answered. Both the great political parties have been accused of this crime, and neither has been able permanently to blacken the other with it, for the reason that both are equally involved. But it is to some extent gratifying to find that I am able to relieve"], [428, "290 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. both Whig and Tory of tbe primary and principal responsibility which attaches to this iconoclastic and ruinous proceeding, and place it upon the proper head. This is the head of someone hitherto unsuspected, \u2014 the head of the celebrated engineer, Mr. Rennie. Mr. Rennie. \u2014 In 1803, when there were threats of invasion, Rennie was consulted by the Government on the subject of improving the dockyards, which were being outstripped by private enterprise, and he made a report in which he recommended that Deptford Dockyard should be retained, but not as a building yard, and Woolwich Dockyard abolished. Woolwich, he said, was too high up the river, the water was shallow, and tbe place was incapable of enlargement to the required extent except at enormous cost. Large ships, even if built there, must, go down the stream into deeper water before they could take in guns, stores, and provisions. Chatham, it should be noted, was also condemned by Mr. Rennie, as incapable of being adapted to the national requirements ; but the authorities, though they have taken his advice as to Woolwich and Deptford, have gone in the opposite course with respect to Chatham. Rennie's leading idea was a magnificent new dock at Northfleet. Woolwich Dockyard was not closed until sixty-six years after this, but the great engineer's report was ever before the Admiralty, and at last both Conservative and Liberal concurred in the doom of the mother dock, whose final knell I stood at the gate to hear as the last of the workmen were \"rung out\" on the 18th of September, 1869. The expediency of abolishing the river yards and enlarging the remaining establishments was discussed in the House of Commons in 1868. It was then thought advisable to retain Deptford for victualling purposes, and to get rid of Woolwich altogether as soon as tbe extensions at Chatham were completed. The first Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Childers, in his speech on the Navy Estimates, 8th March, 1869, said, painful as it might be to close Woolwich Dockyard on 1st October following, as affecting the interests of so large a town, tbe only question was, \" Is Woolwich Dockyard required or not? \" and the only answer is that, \" It is not required.\" He said that Deptford should be kept as a storeyard, which was necessary on the Thames. Ruin and Migration. \u2014 The closing of the Dockyard had been just preceded by extensive reductions in the Royal Arsenal, by the removal of the clothing stores to Pimlico, and by the abolition of the Woolwich Division of Royal Marines. If the accumulation of disasters had been deliberately planned to ruin the town it could hardly have heen more complete. Terrible distress prevailed amongst the families of the workpeople, and owners of houses in the Dockyard district suffered"], [429, "PLATE XXXI Woohoich Emigrants embarking for Canada, 1869.

The whole place now consists of a few workshops and a number of supplementary stores under the charge of the Ordnance Department Woolwich Dockyard during the Great Storm of January 18th, 1881. at the Royal Arsenal.

The Great Storm. \u2014 The illustration here given perpetuates the remarkable storm of January 18th, 1881, when the snow fell three feet deep in the streets of Woolwich, and the tide rose eight inches higher at the Dockyard than was ever before known. Lifehoats. \u2014 The Dockyard and the town of Woolwich are entitled to a goodly share in the history of the Lifeboat Institution. Captain Washington, hydrographer to the Royal Navy, was the fidus achates of Algernon, Duke of Northumberland, the great resuscitator of the"], [432, "292 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. lifeboat enterprise ; and it was in Washington's house in Wood Street (afterwards occupied by the late Admiral Robertson) that the plans were drawn and discussed. It was in Woolwich Dockyard, soon after the Exhibition of 1851, that the first boat on the improved plan was tried in the presence of the Duke aforesaid, Sir Edward Perrott, and other friends of the Institution ; and it was at Woolwich Dockyard gates that the lifeboat carriage was found to be scientifically constructed too wide to pass through, in consequence of which the whole concern had to be floated down the river to the Royal Arsenal. At that time there were not a dozen lifeboats round the coast, where now they are counted by hundreds. Dockyard Accidents. \u2014 The career of Woolwich Dockyard, minus its own collapse, has been remarkably free from disasters. The most serious accident we have on tbe records was a singular explosion, which is thus described : \u2014 On Dec. 30th, 1812, in the afternoon, a machine used in Mr. Lukin's drying-house at Woolwich, for the purpose of bending and seasoning timber, unfortunately burst, in consequence of being over-charged, by which eight individuals lost their Uves, and fourteen were dangerously hurt, several having their legs and thighs broken. The premises on which the machine stood were destroyed by the explosion, which is represented as having been most terrific. Several of the men left large fanuUes.

Drawn by Paul Sandby in 1773. CHAPTER XXV. ANCESTRY OF THE ROYAL ARSENAL. Through the gloom of ages, it is not easy to discern the origin of the Royal Arsenal, and legendary mist has lent superfluous aid to obscurity ; but, by diligence and patience, we may, at least partly, penetrate the darkness, and see, perchance, tbe light. How it was not Created. \u2014 It is unnecessary any longer to refute the romantic story which for so many years found acceptance as tbe true narrative of the events which led to the establishment of the national works at Woolwich. It is now so thoroughly disproved and discredited that it may be with safety repeated as one of the legends of the place without fear of its imposing upon anyone. The story is that Mr. Schalch, who for many years held the office of Master Founder at Woolwich, obtained his appointment by predicting an explosion which was caused by a damp mould at tbe casting of a great gun at Moor fields in 1716, at which seventeen persons were killed and many others injured, amongst tbe latter being General Borgard, first Com mandant of Woolwich. Source of the Error. \u2014 This tradition, which was destroyed by Lieutenant (now Colonel) G. E. Grover, R.E., in a paper addressed to the Royal Artillery Institution, about the year 1874, appears in the book known as \"Beauties of England and Wales,\" published in 1806, and the writer says that he derived his information partly from \" Vestiges"], [439, "297 WOOLWICH. Collected and Recollected,\" * by J. Moser, Esq., who was collaterally related to Schalch, and partly from a conversation with L. Gaschlin,f Dr. Hutton, + and other officers belonging to the establishments at Woolwich. In Emhryo. \u2014 But while we know the Schalch theory to be a delusion, we have no other authority whatever in the shape of document or record of any kind to show us when the Arsenal actually came into being. We see that the site upon which it stands was in the early days a half wild, and, in the very early days, an unenclosed, spot, inhabited chiefly by rabbits, and known as \" The Warren,\" \u00a7 and of those early days we can learn little else. But there are evidences, nevertheless \u2014 positive and substantial, as well as circumstantial evi dences \u2014 to prove that the beginning of the Government works at this spot is just as ancient as, if not more ancient than, the first inception of their sister establishment, the Dockyard, which we have succeeded in tracing as far back as 1512. Date of Birth. \u2014 Common rumour, through the mouth of Moser and others, assigned its birth, as we have said, to 1716, but Grover conjectured an existence dating back to 1667. It will probably appear from these records that it came into existence, at least in tbe bud, fully a century earlier. Grover fixes upon 1667 because in that year Prince Rupert was ordered by the King || to raise works and batteries at Wool wich, and build in the Warren a platform with sixty guns upon it as a defence against the Dutch. This parapet is shown on the interesting plan prepared by General Borgard in 1701, H and a footpath along the river bank is described in several later maps as \" Prince Rupert's Walk.\" But I think there is sufficient warrant for concluding that the Warren was acquired and fortified by tbe nation long before Prince Rupert made his appearance at Woolwich. I propose to submit my evidence. A Venerahle Witness. \u2014 In the King's Library is preserved a skin of vellum on which is drawn in colours a plan of the Thames as it appeared in 1588, this having been prepared to show Queen Elizabeth the nature of the defences provided for the resistance of the \" In- , * European Magazine, 1802. + Lewis GaschUn was Schalch's nephew, and assisted him for many years. When more than eighty years of age he was stiU employed at the Warren as principal modeUer. J Dr. Hutton, the celebrated mathematician, was Professor of Mathematics at the Royal MiUtary Academy, at that time part of the Warren. \u00a7 In 1717, Harris, in his History of Kent, says, \" On the Warren, or as it is now called ' Woolwich Green,' the officers of the Ordnance usuaUy prove and try fheU new-cast guns,\" and a picture of the Warren, dated 1739, has the foUowing des- cription : \" This place is called ' The Warren,' and by some ' Woolwich Green.'\" || Charles II. IT Plate XXXIII."], [440, "298 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. vincible Armada \" if it should, in pursuance of the Spanish boast, dare to ascend the river. From this plan I have copied the portion which embraces Woolwich and the reaches of the Thames from Greenwich to Erith. It is on a very small scale, and the artist's colouring is a little confusing, further than which its great age must be taken into account. Old Plan of Thames, showing Woolwich in time of Queen Elizabeth, 1588 Woolwich Church. \u2014 It will be seen that the drawing represents Woolwich Church with a spire,* and delineates a battery of seven (?) guns either on Market Hill or at the Warren, showing their ranges up and down the stream. There are similar batteries shown in the original at Erith, Greenhithe, and Gravesend, and barriers of gunboats are moored across the river at Gravesend, as they are here seen above Charlton. The Breaches at Plumstead. \u2014 While we have this plan before us, it is well to note the great breach in the river wall at Crossness, the little breach at Trip Cot (which was a building on the bank), and the breaches on the northern side of the river, where also was a house which seems to have given its name to Gallions Reach. The point called \"Magott Nesse \" is now corrupted into \"Margaret's,\" and Tripcot is generally written \" Tripcock.\" \" Podde's Elms \" have disappeared, and the reach which bore their name has now no title more chaste than that of \" Bugsby's Hole.\" I may remark that the Dockyards of Woolwich and Deptford are unseen on this plan, though no especial inference is due to the circumstance, as each would have consisted merely of a sunken building slip, with no erections worth showing on so crude an elevation as this is. * The enlargement in the right-hand lower corner shows this earliest view of Woolwich as it appears under the microscope. I do not conclude from this that the church had a pointed spUe, the old draughtsmen being accustomed to use that sign indiscriminately for aU churches."], [441, "299 WOOLWICH. The Tower at Woolwich. \u2014 But, to reach the question now at issue, I would point out that the plan brings to our view, in addition to the church, two distinct spires or columns at the eastern end of the town. The smaller represents the turret of the Ropeyard, erected, as we shall presently see, in 1573-6 ; the other can be hardly anything else than the tower which has hitherto been known as \" Rupert's.\" If this be granted, then it is proved that the Tower Place existed in the reign of Elizabeth, and to establish the fact beyond question, we have an important piece of documentary proof. Sir Martin Bowes,* who was the wealthy man of Woolwich in the time of Henry VIII., and Lord Mayor of London in 1545, is shown by a deed still in existence to have owned \" the Tower in Woolwich,\" and the same (described as a \" capi tal messuage \"t) was sold by his son on the 14th of April, 1568, which was after his father's death, to Jobn Peers and Alice bis wife. The \" Tower Place,\" as it was then called, came soon afterwards into the occupation of tbe BarnesJ family, and, Sir William Barnes being a Crown official, it was probably at this time that the property passed into tbe bands of the Government. What was it ? \u2014 From these circumstances it would appear that the Tower Place was originally a family mansion, having close beside, but quite detached, a high, substantial, hexagonal column. It is diffi cult to assign the motive of the builder in providing this lofty pillar as an appendix to his dwelling-place. Possibly it may have been raised merely for its ornamental aspect, or for the view to be gained from it ; or it may have been intended for a scientific observatory, or a shot tower. There is, however, a real presentment of the edifice to be seen in a large and admirable model at the United Service Institution, by which we may study its purpose at leisure ; and there are several excellent drawings extant, one of which, from the accurate hand of Paul Sandby, I reproduce at the head of this chapter. I have come to the conclusion that it was not merely one of those towers for casting shot such as we see in the vicinity of Southwark, for the model just mentioned shows that it had five floors, with staircases from floor to floor \u2014 an arrangement which was evidently part of the original structure, and inconsistent with the shot-making hypothesis. I think the most feasible supposition I can offer is that the tower was one of those look-out posts which were planted at various parts of the Thames for the protection of the royal palace at Greenwich and the city of London.g It was finally pulled * See various records as per Index. t Messuage : dwelling-house and grounds. J See various records as per Index. \u00a7 For instance, it is stated in the chronicles of the city that in 1380, John Phelip- pot, late Mayor of London, undertook, at his own cost, to build a tower on the banks of the Thames, \" sixty king's feet in height,\" to protect the shipping and the city from hostile attacks and alarm, and the city undertook the building of a second tower."], [442, "300 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. down more than a hundred years ago, having probably become decrepit and unsafe. The date of demolition was August, 1786. The mansion, not the tower, is said to have been rebuilt by Sir John Vanbrugh in 1719, as we now see it, for it is the present Pattern Room of the Roval Laboratory ; but the foundations and lower walls may be pronounced remnants of the ancient fabric, seeing that they are in places six and seven feet thick, a circumstance which we cannot recon cile with the necessities of the Tudor age. Supposing that it has been rebuilt, we can only guess at the appearance and character of the ancient and original mansion ; but it probably resembled other old and half-fortified domiciles which are still to be met with, such an one as Spenser describes \u2014 A stately palace built of brick, Whose waUs were high and strong and thick. High Usted np with lofty towers, Full of faU windows and deUghtful bowers, And on the top, a dial told the hours. The Germ of the Arsenal. \u2014 The building bears to this day in many of its apartments, especially on the upper floors, strong evidences of its residential character, but, judged by its outward appearance, even in its present shape, its origin and purpose may well be conceived to have been, in some measure, defensive. It is undoubtedly entitled to our respect as the oldest and most important structure in or near Woolwich, and also, I believe, as the very germ of our great Arsenal. What it has heen. \u2014 The Tower House has been put to many uses and has various periods of history. Conceiving the object of its tower to have been defensive, and judging by relative circumstances, it may be thought to have dated from the time of Edward III. or Richard II. (1327-99), and to give the spot a militant connection of five centuries. Until about 1570, however, the house was but a private residence, and after it passed into the hands of the Government it remained for several generations the dwelling-place of successive Masters General of the Ord nance. It was the first home of the Royal Artillery, and it became the birthplace of the Royal Military Academy. As an early museum of curiosities it was once on the verge of destruction by fire, but it has now risen again to be an exhibition of warlike wonders more strange and vast than anything which its older occupants could have dreamt of. We may not know, then, the positive inception of the Royal Arsenal. Like the little negress, it may perhaps be said to have \" growed \" rather than to have been born ; but I can have no doubt that around this nucleus have been gathered all the storehouses, barracks, and factories which have in the course of the last three hundred years built up the"], [443, "301 WOOLWICH, garrison town of Woolwich. Palace or castle, the Tower House was the father of the Royal Arsenal. Woolwich Ropeyard. \u2014 Possibly in searching out the age of the Royal Arsenal, we may find some collateral testimony in the records of the Ropeyard. To most of those who now inhabit Woolwich, the Ropeyard is a mere tradition. And yet, for near three centuries, the Ropehouse was one of the most important hives of industry in the locality. Origin. \u2014 The Ropehouse was erected in 1573-6* (in the reign of Elizabeth) to supply cordage to the navy. The builder was Thomas Allen, \" the Queen's merchant,\" who, in the year 1579, we find in pos session of a leases of the place, then described as \" the long workhouse,\" and certain grounds in Woolwich adjoining the land of Dr. Gilbourne.J A plan of the rope ground shows that it consisted of a single ropewalk and a double ropewalk, a large storehouse, a tar-kettle house, old and new tar-cellars, and houses for the Master Ropemaker and Clerk of the Ropeyard. There were also several watch-cabins outside the walls to shelter the night watchmen. (Plate XXVI.)

MS. available for reference. We have a letter from the Ordnance officers at Woolwich (April 16, 1663) urging the need of repairs to the Gun Wharf, which they point out is also \" used for rope,\" and asking for timber to repair it; and there is a complaint from William Bodham, clerk and principal of the Ropeyard (August 3, 1664) showing the decayed state of \" the wharf in the Ropeyard where the crane stands.\" It is almost certain that tbe wharf referred to in both these cases is the same, and it requires very little effort to connect it with \" the storehouse by the water\" built by Allen in 1572. Therefore we trace the wharf and crane of the Ropewalk and the Gun Wharf of the Ordnance officers to the adjacent bank of the river, east of Warren Lane, and conclude with some certainty that the said wharf must have been that which forms the extremity of the Royal Laboratory.* Consequently we may decide that the rudimentary Arsenal and the Ropewalk existed together from the earlier part of Elizabeth's reign ; and, if there is any doubt in fixing this period for its origin, I should say that it is in favour of according to the embryo factory a line of antiquity remoter still. Stepping hack One Hundred Years. \u2014 However, taking the dates as clearly fixed (viz., 1545, for the existence in private hands of the Tower House, 1570 or thereabouts for its first occupation by a Government officer, 1572 for the building of the Ropehouse, and various other references which show that the Ropehouse and the wharf were one), we may fairly claim to have succeeded in carrying back the records of the Royal Arsenal a century beyond the period for which it has yet had credit. A Naval Descent. \u2014 For a hundred years or so tbe Ropehouse and the Warren were under one head, and that head the Board of Admiralty, or Navy Commissioners. We may, therefore, in continuing the narrative, follow for a time the records of one as the records of both, the greater including the less, and the greater being the Ropeyard. The Stuart Kings. \u2014 -Elizabeth's successor, James I., being devoted to his ships, looked well after his Ropeyard, which was the principal one in the kingdom and meet companion to the Mother Dockyard. There are saved from the lumber of James's reign three certificates of the year 1621, signed by Richard Chester, John King, Joshua Downing and others, showing the excellence of the cordage in his Majesty's Ropeyard; but the rule of Charles I., as may be imagined, was as disastrous here as it was at the sister establishment, though the * Pepys, Secretary to the Admiralty, who frequently visited the Ropeyard, speaks in his diary (Aug. 23rd, 1663) of embarking at the Tower Gates, referruig apparently to the steps adjacent to the Tower Place. TJ 2"], [448, "304 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT, Ropeyard has not always followed the fortunes of the Dockyard, for we sometimes find the one in a flourishing state while the other lan guished. Both, however, were at a low ebb under the feeble adminis tration of the martyr-king. The Conquest of India. \u2014 The chronicles of the Dockyard have already shown that the East India Company went out with its expedi tions for commerce and for conquest with its ships equipped at Wool wich, and the archives of the company show us that much of its good fortune sprang from hence. The possession of India, that resplendent jewel in the crown of England, is therefore distinctly connected with the records of Woolwich. The East India Company estahlished at Woolwich.\u2014 Charles was able to spare his dockyard entirely to the company for a short time in 1628, for we read that in February of that year \" the use of Woolwich Dockyard was granted to the East India Company for fourteen days for the repair of two of their ships, and grounding another for inspection,\" and the company's affection for the town ripened to such an extent that in a few years afterwards they proposed to take the Ropeyard wholly into their keeping. There is a report from the officers ofthe navy dated May 24th, 1633, showing that they had been in treaty with the East India Company about his Majesty's Rope house at Woolwich, to be let to them for three years, the company agreeing to pay \u00a3100 a year and build a brick wall about the yard. The report speaks favourably of the proposal, and, in a charter of June 5th in the same year, His Majesty makes acquiescence, saying that he is \" well content that the Ropehouse be let to the East India Company.\" On June 11th Sir William Russell writes with satisfaction at the pros pect, seeing that all things at the Ropeyard are \" exceedingly ruinated and purlioned away, to the king's prejudice,\" and the transfer was finally concluded by the Council on June 22nd. The brick wall was built in 1634,* but, for some reason unexplained, the three years ten ancy did not run out, for it appears that on July 14th, 1635, an Admi ralty order was passed to \" receive again the Ropehouse at Woolwich, formerly lent to the East India Company.\" While tbe place was in the Company's occupation we hear complaints, such as might be expected, of alien labour supplanting the natives, for the company brought their own officers and probably their own workmen with them. There is a petition dated October 31st, 1633, addressed to Secretary Coke, from Thomas Argoll, clerk (and principal) of tbe Ropeyard, setting * A State paper of Charles I. (MS.) says that the new wall extended by the highway on the north side to Dr. Gilbourne's land, and that it was under considera- tion to buUd a wall also on the south-west, between the yard and the land of Dr. Gilbourne, to whom the fence on that side belonged."], [449, "305 WOOLWICH. forth that he bad served in tbe Navy since 1588, and had since been employed for thirteen years making cordage at Woolwich, but that \" since the 24th of June last, the East India Company have the King's ropeyard and employ their own ministers.\" He therefore prays for a purser's place in one of the new ships. The Civil War. \u2014 It was about this time that Charles I. made that levy for the improvement of the navy which brought such trouble to the country and to himself; but Woolwich, which has prospered through many misfortunes, began once more to look up. The Ropeyard was started again as a Government establishment on a larger scale and with plenty of lucrative employment. In 1642 the civil war broke out, and for the five years in which it raged Woolwich seems to have been left in undisturbed peace and unmolested industry. The Protector.\u2014 Neither did the advent of the Commonwealth impair our good luck. Quite the contrary : Cromwell's republicanism bore early fruit in an order of October, 1649, increasing the wages of the Woolwich ropemakers all round on condition that \" they spin nineteen threads per day, the whole length of the Ropeyard, the same to weigh 77 lbs. ; \" the spinners also having their pay raised from eighteen pence to twenty pence per day, the hatchelors * from sixteen pence to seven teen pence, the winders from fifteen pence to sixteen pence, and the labourers from fourteen pence to fifteen pence. The impulse given to commerce and naval enterprise under the Protectorate is well known and undeniable. We have already seen its effect upon this station, and there is every reason to suppose that the Ropewalk was no exception to the rule of activity which prevailed at this time in all things connected with the national service. We may, indeed, through all our annals, read with tolerable accuracy the history of England in the records of Woolwich. Consequently, we must not expect such a satisfactory report from the reign of Charles II. Charles II. \u2014 Indeed, the period of the \"Merrie Monarch\" was a miserable time for the ropemakers, for work was scarce, and money scarcer. Tbe men were always begging to be paid their arrears of wages, and some of their petitions are most pitiful. In 1657, they pleaded that they were six months behind, and \" greatly prejudiced by running scores with merciless chandlers and mealmen.\" But things got worse rather than better, and when the arrears grew to nine months, instead of asking the King to pay up, they seem to have succeeded better by suggesting that he should increase their wages to 2s. 3d. per day, \" like the ropemakers of London.\" * Hatchelors = flax-beaters."], [450, "306 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT.

Bodham tells me there is one dead at Woolwich, not far from the Ropehouse. God preserve us. A Clerkly Ropemaker. \u2014 Mr. Bodham, clerk of the Ropehouse, was an energetic officer and an industrious correspondent. There are many letters from him in existence, mostly on dry matters of business, but lightened here and there by strange conceits. Here is an Admiralty minute, which throws a slur upon his orthodoxy : \u2014 1664. Feb. 21st. \u2014 WilUam Bodham reports a fire at the George alehouse near the Ropeyard, caused by the keeper entertaining some ropemakers and suffering them to be drunk. He has turned this man [presumably a ropemaker] out of the works, and recommends a certain honest fellow in his stead, but, being one whose private opinions suffer him not to go to church, is doubtful whether he may be entered. Cheats in the Ropewalk. \u2014 So conscientious a subject must have been greatly annoyed by the discovery which was made in this same year (August 17th, 1664), that tbe weights at the Ropeyard were too light, and that the Government had thereby been defrauded of \u00a3500 in four years \u2014 a demonstration of the same official morality which had raised the suspicions of Pepys in 1661. At this time (1664) the Dutch war made the ropemakers busy again, and they were spinning two tons per day. Peculation seemed to flourish in proportion to the labour"], [451, "307 WOOLWICH. done, although the yard was surrounded by watch-boxes, and although as many as thirteen persons were sent to Maidstone for trial in 1663 for stealing one piece of cable. Such trifles, however, did not disturb honest Mr. Bodham, nor impair his cheerful humour. Ten days after the exposure of the false weights (April 27th, 1664) he wrote a letter to the Government, suggesting, in his simplicity, that if a small belfry or turret were erected on his dwelling-house, he would pay for a clock for the yard himself. Bodham's residence must have been distinct from the main building, or the turret must have been temporarily absent, for in all the illus trations which we have of the place, before and after this date, the tur ret is clearly shown.* A Strike. \u2014 In the midst of the war time there was a strike among the ropemakers, but it only lasted five days, and we are not told its causeor purpose. Bodham simply reports (October 25th, 1665) that the whole of the refractory workmen who were away from the Ropeyard from the 13th to the 18th have returned peaceably and continued their employment. The powers of our managing clerk as a complete letter-writer were usefully employed in 1667 on behalf of Widow Lacy, who, having suc ceeded her husband in a department of the Ropeyard where the \" twice laid stuff \" was prepared, was forced to resign her appointment in conse quence of her son flying for debt, and Bodham urgently appealed to the Admiralty for payment of \u00a350 due to her on three bills, as she was \" without wood or coals to lay on the fire, and her indigent creditors are in as bad a case.\" William III. \u2014 King William III. had the Ropeyard extended on his arrival in 1688 at a cost of \u00a34,345, making its total length 1061 feet. In the survey of harbours made in 1698, it is stated that the value of the place before the Revolution (1688) was \u00a34,508, and after the altera tions, \u00a38,854. In the seventeenth year of George II. (1744) an Act of Parliament was passed to purchase an acre and a quarter of orchard ground near the Ropeyard from Mr. Edward Bowater. Another Strike. \u2014 This was war-time again, for the Pretender was in the field, and we had another strike. There were about four hun dred ropemakers employed in the yard, and the demand for skilled workmen was great. But the ropemakers refused to take apprentices, a proceeding which displeased tbe King so much that he sent out his press-gangs, seized eight of the protectionist mechanics, and had them taken away to the ships at the Nore to make them serve as sailors. * An official description of 1739 says, \" The Ropery has a turret and bell.\""], [452, "308 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Thereupon the whole of the remaining ropemakers struck work and volunteered for the navy ; and as the King could not do without his cables and cordage, he had to give way and send the eight pressed men back to their victorious companions. Lahour Lost, \u2014 Peace, however, lowered the pride of the haughty artisans, and they did not have another such opportunity, Royal Rope yards being established elsewhere and the labour distributed. In 1756, when we were at war with France, there were but twenty spinners and seven labourers in Woolwich Ropeyard, although it was reported that, having three spinning-wheels ready, the place could accommodate seventy men and spin a ton a day. Again, in 1774, in the midst ofthe terrible conflict which lost America, there were only a hundred and forty men, all told, in the Ropery ; and yet Hasted tells us, a few years later (in 1777), that it was here tbe biggest cables were still made for the men-of-war, some of them being twenty-seven inches in circumfer ence and two hundred and sixty yards long. But the establishment never regained the high position from which its four hundred monopo lists precipitated it in the time of George II. At its full size the enclosure was 1080 feet in length and in the shape of a parallelogram, as may be seen from Barker's plan on page 40. The buildings at the eastern end were three stories high. Fires. \u2014 The whole place was in peril of destruction by fire on two or three occasions, being built mainly of wood, and often heated for manufacturing purposes to a high degree. In 1759, by the boiling over of a tar-kettle, a considerable portion of the main building was de stroyed, and on the 8th of July, 1813, another still more disastrous fire entirely consumed the white hemp-house. On this occasion, the fire, which was supposed to have been incendiary, broke out between seven and eight in the morning and burned until ten, creating vast excite ment in the town and threatening the Royal Arsenal. The drums were beat to call out the military, and a thousand artillerymen were employed in extinguishing the fire. Finis. \u2014 The period of decay was prolonged until 1835, when the old buildings were finally condemned and sold, the site being pur chased by Mr. George Smith, of Woolwich. The church and schools of Holy Trinity, and the houses on both sides of Beresford Street, were built upon the ground prior to 1843.* The old materials were mostly employed in erecting the new houses, but the foundation walls were left undisturbed, and are unearthed whenever the excavators are at work upon the sewers, gas-mains, or water-pipes. These buried relics run the whole length of Beresford Street near the southern side. * See illustration, page 171."], [453, "The Royal Foundry and Rookery in 1779 (Sandby's original drawing). CHAPTER XXVI. INFANCY OF THE ROYAL ARSENAL. Woolwich Warren or Green. \u2014 Having followed the fortunes of the Ropery, which was almost unquestionably the progenitor of the Royal Arsenal, and attended its mournful decease, we must go back to the infancy of its offspring. Woolwich Warren, or Woolwich Green, extended from the border of the old town at Warren Lane until it merged in the swamp or \" salt ings \" of tbe Plumstead Marsh. The ancient embankment of the river ceased along the whole front of it, the gravel bed of which the soil mainly consists having raised the surface sufficiently above the prevailing level of the river shore to save it from the tides ; but a copious stream ran through it from the hills, covering with pools and reed-beds the low grounds to the east, while the sandy knolls on the town side were clothed with a coarse growth of turf and bramble, and burrowed through and through by colonies of rabbits. Hence its name, the Warren. It was unenclosed \u2014 an open, uncultured, worthless waste. But at length the growth of the town and the favouring site, on the"], [454, "310 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. edge of a vast and bright and beautiful river, teeming with fish, and convenient for communication with the cities of London and Westmin ster, attracted to the spot some wealthy citizen, and here he built, close to Warren Lane, the great Tower House. This dwelling-place was the seed of the Royal Arsenal. Tower Place. \u2014 The mansion stood a hundred yards or so from the river, on solid ground ; but it was here that the elevation upon which Woolwich grew began to disappear, and the soil by the waterside assumed the soddened boggy character of the neighbouring marsh. Hence, as the Crown had need of it, and as other buildings arose, it became requisite to carry the drains through the peaty earth upon deep foundation walls of brick,* and by the mere landing-stage provided for the accommodation of the folks at Tower Place, walls and wharves were built, little by little, until tbe whole frontage of the old Warren was breasted in, redeemed from the waste and quagmire, and added to the dry ground. Such was the infancy of the Royal Arsenal. Early Ordnance Departments. \u2014 The theory herein formulated is sufficiently justified by the records of the preceding chapter, but these may be reinforced by some others bearing more directly upon this section of our subject. All that we have hitherto seen of the primitive establishments at Woolwich are of a naval character, but we may also learn that the Ordnance departments were supplied from hence even at the early times when not only were the army and navy much commingled, but gunners, pikemen, archers, and musqueteers were all employed together in the composition of the British forces. In 1585, which was the twenty-seventh year of EUzabeth, her Majesty found it necessary to repair her storehouses, as witness the following specification : \u2014 An estimate for the office of Thordinauncet for the seas needeful to be taken in hande, as also newe buylding and other reparacions to be done at her highnes store house of Thordenaunce at Woolwich, viz. : reparacions to the crane at a house for Thordinaunce workmen at Woolwich ; . . . the wharfes there to be repaUed ; ... the paUinge to be repaUed.

The armoury, storehouse, and workshop of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth was by the Thames at Woolwich, under the shadow of the Tower House, from 1572. The establishment grew by several slight additions during tbe following fifty years ; and it was at this spot, on the ground now occupied by the Royal Laboratory, that Prince Rupert found the King's Warren when, in the course of his meteoric life, he came to Woolwich. * Backs and breasts for almaine corslets were parts of armour for pikemen ; bom- bards, padded breeches ; burgonets, helmets."], [456, "Prince Rupert. CHAPTER XXVH. PRINCE RUPERT AT THE ROYAL ARSENAL Rupert's Life and Character. \u2014 His Royal Highness Prince Rupert, of whom I give a faithful portrait, was third son of the King of Bohemia, by the Princess Elizabeth, eldest daughter of James I. of England, having been born in 1619. He was educated for the army, and on the commencement of the rebellion, which happened when he was scarcely of age, he offered his services to his uncle, Charles I. Throughout the whole war he behaved with great intrepidity. King Charles made him a Knight of the Garter, and a free denizen, and advanced him to the dignity of a peer of England, by the title of Earl of Holdernesse and Duke of Cumberland. When the civil war was over Rupert went abroad with a pass from the Parliament, but after the Restoration he was invited to return to England, and had several offices conferred upon him. In 1666 the King (Charles II.) appointed him, in conjunction with the Duke of Albemarle, to command the fleet."], [457, "313 WOOLWICH. He led, however, a retired life, mostly at Windsor Castle, of which he was governor, spent a great part of his time in chemical and philosophical experiments, as well as the practice of mechanical arts. He designed locks for fire-arms, invented \"pinchbeck,\" a composition called from him \" Prince's metal,\" and communicated to the Royal Society his improvements upon gunpowder. He also acquainted them with an engine he had contrived for raising water, and sent them an instrument for casting any platform into perspective. He was like wise the inventor of a gun for discharging several bullets with the utmost speed, facility, and safety ; and the Royal Society received from him the intimation of a certain method of blowing up rocks in mines and other subterraneous places. His skill in painting was noted, and he was considered the inventor of mezzotint. As a soldier he was brave but rash, and some of the reverses suffered by his uncle (Charles I.) have been attributed to his hasty and unguarded tactics. Prince Rupert's Warrant. \u2014 It was after the restoration of the monarchy that Prince Rupert was employed by his cousin, Charles II. , to construct batteries at Woolwich for the resistance of the threatened Dutch invasion. The King's warrant is dated June 13th, 1667, and is addressed, \" to our dearest cousin, Prince Rupert, Comte Palatine of ye Rhine and Duke of Cumberland.\" It begins \u2014 Most Dere Cousin. Wee greet you weU. Wheras wee have appointed certaine works and batterys to be forthwith raised at or neare Woolwich for ye better security of ye river against ye attempt of ye enemy in this conjuncture of affaUs, &c. Fortifying the Warren. \u2014 The Prince is accordingly requested to undertake the work, and persons of all ranks are charged to obey his orders. Soon we learn that on the 28th of June, 1667, one Roger Wiggen received \u00a3200 from Sir Stephen Fox, which he immediately carried to Woolwich, and deUvered into the hands of Prince Rupert, and that in a very short time after a platform or battery was built for sixty guns. Reference may now be made to General Borgard's plan of 1701,* which, in the opinion of Grover, shows a parapet along the river wall, thirteen feet thick and pierced with forty embrasures at central intervals of eighteen feet, there being room for at least twenty more guns on the parapet if required, It also shows, in rear of the parapet, \" Prince Rupert's Walk ; \" and, in rear of that, a wet ditch surrounding what appears to have originally been a triangular demi-bastioned work, such as were common in England towards the middle of the seventeenth century. Rupert's defences were unquestionably at the Warren, and there Borgard found them, or their remains, thirty-four years later. * Plate XXXIII."], [458, "314 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Duration Of the Defences. \u2014 It should be pointed out, however, that the timber which was lent by the Admiralty to the Office of Ordnance for this purpose was redemanded at tbe close of tbe war, and that, as will be seen in the chronicles of the Dockyard, it was duly returned. We must consequently suppose either that the batteries remained without the timber, or that they were demolished and rebuilt by Borgard, who certainly did construct new defences at this place. I prefer to believe with Grover that the batteries remained, and Prince Rupert's Walk, shown in the rear of tbe works, strengthens the idea.* A Sickly Spot. \u2014 The greater portion of the Arsenal nearest the river was, even at this time, a mere morass and desert, and the locality was very unhealthy, so that many officers and men employed upon the batteries were taken ill, and some of them died. The old difficulty connected with supplies still prevailed, and we may honestly suspect that the troops were ill-provisioned, for the national exchequer was just then quite empty, and King Charles II. was glad to borrow a special \u00a310,000 from the City of London for the defence of the Thames. His fleet had been crippled by poverty, recklessness, and incompetence, and all the disgrace and disaster and misery which befell England in the seventeenth century wars may be set down to tbe waste of their noble inheritance by the hapless Stuarts. The' fearful hate engendered in the internecine war between Charles I. and his people, is illustrated by Lord Macaulay in the following verses, which form part of a composition on the Battle of Naseby, June 14th, 1645, written by Obadiah Bind-their-kings-in chains-and-their-nobles-with-fetters-of-iron, Sergeant of Ireton's Regi ment : \u2014 It was about the noon of a glorious day of June, That we saw their banners dance and their cuirasses shine, And the Man of Blood was there, with his long essenced hair, And Astley, and Sir Marmaduke, and Rupert of the Rhine. And hark]! like the roar of the biUows on the shore, The cry of battle rises along their charging line ! For God ! for the Cause ! for the Church ! for the Laws ! For Charles, King of England, and Rupert of the Rhine ! The furious German comes, with his clarions and his drums, His bravoes of Alsatia, and pages of Whitehall ; They are bursting on our flanks. Grasp your pikes, close your ranks ! For Rupert never comes but to conquer or to fall. They are here ! They rush on ! We are broken ! We are gone ! Our left is borne before them like stubble on the blast. O Lordjput forth Thy might ! 0 Lord, defend the right ! Stand back to back in God's name, and fight it to the last. * The name of Rupert's Walk still clung to the road at the Laboratory end as lately \" as 1850 but it has at last died out. The trees opposite the Royal Gun Factory offices are a remnant of the row of elms which skirted this pleasant promenade."], [459, "315 WOOLWICH. Their heads all stooping low, their points all in a row, Like a whirlwind on the trees, like a deluge on the dykes, Our cuirassiers have burst on the ranks of the Accurst, And at a shock have scattered the forest of his pikes. Ho ! comrades scour the plain ; and ere ye strip the slain, First give another stab to make your search secure, Then shake from sleeves and pockets their broad pieces and lockets, The tokens of the wanton, the plunder of the poor. Rupert's Palace. \u2014 From Prince Rupert, we naturally turn again to the building which has so long borne bis name. \" Rupert's Palace \" and \" Rupert's Tower \" have quite supplanted the more ancient and forgotten \"Tower Place,\" and it is common belief that the Prince had here, for some time, a settled abode. It is not unlikely that he may have found a temporary lodging in the Tower House, and made it his headquarters while building his fortifications ; all I can say is that we have no reliable evidence of the fact.* The tradition that Rupert resided at a river-side house near High Street is even less supported by proof or probability, but even this tradition may be true. We simply know nothing about it, and none of his biographies mention the subject. Death of Rupert. \u2014 Prince Rupert died at bis house in Spring Gardens, Whitehall, on November, 29th, 1682, and was interred in Henry VII.'s chapel. After his death, his collection of pictures was sold by auction, but his jewels, which were appraised by three jewellers at \u00a320,000, were disposed of by way of lottery. The tickets were \u00a35 each, and the largest prize, a great pearl necklace, valued at \u00a38,000. The lowest prizes were valued at \u00a3100. The advertisement states that this lotterv was to be \" drawn in his Majesty's presence, who is pleased to declare that he himself will see all the prizes put in among the blanks.\" It has been remarked by Grover, as a coincidence, that the early history of the great military arsenal of England should be associated with the name of a soldier so distinguished as Prince Rupert of Bavaria in the manufacture of war material. Beyond the achievements pre viously mentioned, the Prince is said to have invented a process of annealing cast-iron guns, and to have built a gun-boring mill, turned by water, in Hackney Marsh. Introduction of Gunnery. \u2014 We may not be permitted to know whether Prince Rupert inhabited the Tower Place ; but we are able to * In a note to the engraving by Rooker of Paul Sandby's view of this building, published in 1775 (see p. 296), it is said that, \" This famous seminary is delightfully situated in the Warren, on the hanks of the Thames, where formerly stood a mansion house, the turret of which still remains, and was once inhabited by Prince Rupert.\" But Sandby may have been no better informed than we."], [460, "316 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. discover the purpose to which the building was put within six months of bis death. Colonel Duncan, C.B., M.P., in preparing his \"History of the Royal Artillery,\" met with an old deed dated March, 1683, referring to this place. It sets forth that the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance (who was next in rank to the Master- General), having to give up his official residence in \"ye old artillerie garden situate near ye Spitle in ye parish of St. Buttolph, Bishop's Gate,\" he should be allowed tbe large manor house and grounds known as \" Tower Place at Woolwich,\" together with \" The Warren,\" but on the express condition that the proving of great guns go on as heretofore in Woolwich, that the Government should have full control over all wharves, magazines, cranes, &c, and that a dwelling for the Master Gunner of England* should be allowed in the said mansion house, and lodging for ten field gunners in the adjoining houses, and also for such Ordnance labourers as might be necessary. Thus did gunnery establish its home at Woolwich in 1683. The same arrangements probably continued for about eighty years, during which, as we have said, Tower Place was rebuilt, or partly rebuilt, by Vanbrugh in 1719.f The Rahhit Warren. \u2014 It is rather difficult to reconcile the fore going statement as to jhe tenancy of the Warren with the following extract from the Exchequer Court Rolls of 1691 : \u2014 In the second year of WUliam and Mary, Thomas Lindsey, Rector of Woolwich, sued AUce WeUs, widow, in the Court of Exchequer, for neglecting to pay tithes, estimated at forty shilUngs a year, on great numbers of coneys and rabbits sold in the years 1688-89-90, from about thirty acres called \" the Warren.\" The apparent contradiction is, however, open to several solutions. The Warren may have been only leased to the Ordnance, or part of it may have remained in the occupation of widow Wells ; and yet the land attached to Tower Place in 1717 was forty-two acres. There are thirty-two acres of the Arsenal now in the parish of Woolwich, and it is possible that the thirty acres of the Warren upon which widow Wells paid tithes to Woolwich may be now in Plumstead. The Maker of Fireworks. \u2014 We have just noticed that the Master Gunner of England was to reside in the Tower Place, then described as the \" Mansion House.\" We also see his quarters men tioned as befng in the \" Manor House,\" which probably means the same thing. He appears to have been the chief administrative officer of the early artillery, and Queen Elizabeth entrusted him by letters patent * A tablet to Captain Leake, Master Gunner of England, and EUzabeth his wife, who died 1695-6, is in Woolwich church. They were parents of the famous Admiral. t The date, 1719, may be seen on the hoppers of the rainwater pipes."], [461, ""], [462, "PLATE XXXII.

The Master of the Ordnance was a superior officer, who received in 1544 a salary of \u00a3380, and in 1683, \u00a31,500. New Forts. \u2014 A little later than the arrival at the Warren of these important officials, we hear again of fortifications in a letter addressed by King James II. to his daughter Mary under date of October 2nd, 1688, in which he says \u2014 I was this morning abroad to take the air, and to see some batteries I have made below Woolwich* for the defence of the river. And since I came back, I have been so very busy to prepare things for the invasion intended, that I could not write tiU now. Two months later, the wretched monarch fled in the night past these very batteries, and, taking to his ship in the river, escaped the country, thus ending the dynasty of the Stuart kings. The Enemy off Woolwich. \u2014 The need of defences so high up the river, even after the crisis had passed, is shown by the following extract from a newsletter dated April 13th, 1695 : \u2014 Two small French privateers, under Danish colours, coming up the river to Wool wich with some design, are taken. * Probably Rupert's works restored. REFERENCE TO PLATE XXXII. Major-General Eardley Maitland, C.B., R.A., DUector- General of Ordnance Factories. \u2014 Born at 13, DevonshUe Place, Brighton, December 10, 1833. His father, who served in the Royal Artillery up to 1819 and then went into the Church, was incumbent of St. James's Chapel, Brighton, for many years. Eardley Maitland was at Brighton CoUege and at Dr. Butler's, on the HiU of St. Nicholas, the old parish church of Brighton. He was nominated for competition for the Royal MUitary Academy, Woolwich, by his uncle, General Sir Peregrine Maitland, and, having passed, was entered in May, 1848, and obtained his commission as second Ueutenant, Royal Artillery, in December, 1851. After serving at Woolwich, Landguard Fort, Guernsey, Plymouth, and Purfleet, until 1855, he embarked for Ceylon, whence he proceeded to take part in the suppression of the Indian mutiny Ui 1857-8. Was in the actions of Futtehpore, Aoung, Pandoo-Nuddee, Cawnpore, Oonao, Buseerutgunge, (1st and 2nd) Boorbeakechowkee, Mungarwar, and Alumbagh ; relief, defence, siege, and capture of Lucknow, actions at Selimpore and Sundeela, and operations in Oude. Received medal and three clasps, and a year's service for Lucknow. He remained in India until 1867, and was then at Malta until 1870, when he joined the Woolwich depot and commenced the special studies which led to his appointment as Assistant Superintendent of the Royal Gun Factories in 1872-7. He was then sent to Turkey, as mihtary attache with a special mission to report on war material during the Rnsso- Turkish War, and afterwards became a member of the Siege Operations Committee, the Machine Gun Committee, and Committee on Ordnance, until 1880, when he was made Superintendent of the Royal Gun Factories, which office he held until 1887 when he was selected for the post of DUector-General of Ordnance Factoriee.

The proof of ordnance was transferred to Woolwich from Moorfields at some date between 1665 and 1680, when \" ye Proofe-Master \" was Major Matthew Bayly. Private founders were allowed, then as now, to prove their guns at the Warren, at their own expense ; and there appears to have been no lack either of makers or inventors from the very earliest days of gunnery. Gunnery Science. \u2014 Even breech-loading is no new thing, as may be seen by the primitive weapons at the Rotunda and by the following extract from a Royal Commission report dated September 26, 1645 : \u2014 Petition of Captain Peter Cannon. Petitioner was one of the first employed to provide the train of artillery for the state, and to show his fideUty to the cause of"], [465, "Plan of Woolwich Warren in 1701, by General Borgard.

He has spent much time and money in inventing iron and brass ordnance to he loaded at the hritche, as others now are at the mouth. In this way they may be loaded and discharged much oftener than others, and are more secure by sea and land, to the saving of gunners killed in loading and spung ing other ordnance at the mouth. Petitioner prays that, as he has by his own industry discovered this invention never before attained unto, the House will grant him an ordinance for the making and casting of such ordnance, and that if anyone else should presume to cast any pieces after his invention without his leave, they may be forfeited to the use of the state. An ordinance to the effect desired passed the House of Lords, and was sent to the Commons, but, though often put in mind of it by the Lords, the Commons allowed it to drop. Captain Cannon, however, has left an immortal name. Gun Carriages. \u2014 The \"old carriage yard\" shown in Borgard's map of the Royal Arsenal* (which was drawn in 1701, and is the oldest we have), seems to have been built as early as 1664, an estimate dated July in that year having been found among the records in the Tower of London by Grover, which sets forth the necessity of making the storehouses \"wind and water-tite,\" and for \"keeping dry of ye powder-match and other provisions, and to keep ye said storehouses from falling downe and utter ruin,\" part of which work is specified as \" flooring a stoarehouse att Woolwich to keep shipp carriages dry.\" Further, on 5th October, 1680, there is an order that \" ye sheds at Woolwich along ye Proofehouse, and ye sheds for carriages there, be forthwith repaired ; \" and on 14th November, 1682, another for build ing a new shed at Woolwich, eighty feet broad and a hundred long, \" for lodging of ship carriages in ye place where ye old one is fallen down.\" That this was a workshop, and not merely a store, is shown by an order to Mr. Peach, the Storekeeper in 1683, requiring him to break up eighty-nine old carriages and take out the ironwork. In 1668 it was ordered that \"all ye gunns, carriages, and stores now at Deptford be removed to Woolwich, and from henceforth new ordnance and carriages be layd there.\" Laboratory. \u2014 Next to the Carriage Department came the Royal Laboratory, which was originally attached to the Tilt Yard at Green wich. Among the Treasury papers is a letter dated 9th October, 1694, from the Commissioners of Ordnance to the Lords of the Treasury, stating that the powder had been removed from Greenwich House and the Labora tory, near adjoining, to Gravesend and Tilbury, and that they were in consequence obliged to build a new powder-house in some more * Plate XXXIII. x2"], [468, "320 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. convenient place, which must be ready by the time Admiral Russell was home from tbe Straits, and submitting an estimate and desiring payment of \u00a3500 weekly. The estimates were twofold : \u2014 1st. An estimate for building a new magazine for powder and a convenient wharfe for shipping and unshipping into and out of the same, as also for building a proofehouse and a dwelling-house for the Storekeeper.* 2nd. An estimate for building a laboratory in the Warren att Tower Place att Woolwich. On the 3rd of December, 1695, a warrant was issued to William Edge \u2014 To fetch gravell and raise and levell the ground at the new labonratory att Woolwich, according to agreement with Mr. Boulter. The same Mr. Boulter was employed in January, 1696, to give directions for fitting up tbe Laboratory. There was a \" saltpetre house \" at Woolwich in 1662, and a \" store keeper of saltpetre,\" but there is no certain evidence that explosives were prepared here at that period. In 1681 Sir William Warren was asked to contract for \u2014 The making of two butts at Woolwich for the tryaU of a fire-shott, preparing ot Captain Leake, Master Gunner of England.f In 1682 \" one thousand canon and ten thousand demi-canon round shot \" were taken from \" Tower Wharfe, each side ye Traitors' Gate,\" to Woolwich. On October 4th, 1684, it was ordered that \"a wooden butt shall be built at Woolwich, according to Captain Leake's directions. The \" Greenwich Barne \" was erected at the Warren in 1696. There is an order in the Ordnance journals of December 19th, 1695, for taking down the \" barne \" in Greenwich Tilt Yard and re-erecting it at Woolwich. It was pulled down again in 1716 to make room for the gun foundry, which is now the Laboratory brass foundry. Borgard' s plan of the Warren. \u2014 These dates bring us within reach of 1701 and the plan of General Borgard,^ which speaks for itself. I would simply direct attention to the \" Greenwich Barne,\" just mentioned, near the site of our original gun foundry, to the \" Firework * Until 1759, when Purfleet was established, the principal Government powder magazine was at Greenwich, and the inhabitants frequently complained of the danger of keeping so large a store as six thousand barrels within a quarter of a mile of theU town ; ,\u00a315,000 was voted for the transfer to Purfleet. t Captain Leake, as we have just seen, resided at the Tower Place, in Woolwich Warren.

Barne,\" where the surgery now stands, to the \" smiths' shop \" at the end of the Laboratory, and to tbe many other proofs which it furnishes, that the machinery of Woolwich Arsenal was all in motion, though at a gentle pace, as early as 1701. The \"Greenwich Barne\" aforesaid seems to have been the original Laboratory, before it was removed from the Tilt Yard to Woolwich. By Borgard's plan, and tbe others which succeeded it, we are spared the necessity of pursuing any further the trifling and obscure details at which we have been glad to catch in searching out the earlier facts relating to the Royal Arsenal. We may come at once to the renowned explosion at Moorfields, which was so long accounted the origin of the national workshop. It certainly had a material influence on our fortunes, as we shall see. The Moorfields Explosion. \u2014 Mr. Matthew Bagley* cast all the guns which the Government required from 1704 to 1716 at his foundry in Moorfields, near Finsbury Square, t The guns captured by the Duke of Marlborough were in 1716 ordered to be used for the manu facture of newer ordnance, and on the 10th of May in that year a great many persons of quality assembled to witness the operation, including Borgard, who was then Colonel of Artillery and Chief Firemaster of England. The dampness of the mould, and the consequent generation of steam, caused the metal to be blown out again with terrible sound and fearful consequences. Seventeen persons were killed, including Mr. Bagley and his son ; and a number of others, among whom was Colonel Borgard, were wounded. + General Borgard's diary for 1716 says \u2014 In the month of March I was ordered by the Board of Ordnance to lay before them tables and draughts of all natures of brass and iron cannon, mortars, &c, which was done accordingly and approved of. After the said draughts, two twenty four pounder brass cannon were ordered to be cast by Mr. Bagley in his foundry at Windmill Hill, at the casting of which I was ordered to be present. In the foundry the metal of one of the guns blowed into the air, burnt many of the spectators, of which seventeen died out of twenty-five persons, and myself received four wounds. * The name strongly resembles that of Major Matthew Bayly, who removed the casting from Moorfields to Woolwich thirty or forty years previously (see page 318). t The present well-known Wesleyan Chapel in the City Road had its origin in the Old Foundry, in which Wesley and Whitfield preached to listening thousands. The foundry when disused was taken and fitted up by Mr. Wesley and his friends for a place of worship, and was so used until it was deemed advisable to supersede it by the present building, for which they obtained an excellent frontage opening into the City Road. The \" new chapel \" as it was called\u2014 that is, the present City Road Chapei\u2014 stands a few yards from the old foundry, which is reputed to have been the Government foundry for casting cannon many years prior to 1716. X A gun spoilt in the casting is exhibited at the Rotunda, Woolwich, as the product of this disaster."], [470, "322 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. The accident was a most deplorable one, but it was the making of Wool wich. Only a month elapsed when the following order appeared : \u2014 \"Martis 19*? die Juni], 1716. It having for many yeares been the Opinion of the most experienced Officers that the Government should have a Brass Foundery of their own, and whereas Mr. Bagley's Foundery is the only own for Casting Brass Ordnance & lyable to dangerous Accidents wch cant be prevented.

Two months later the sum of \u00a3300 was paid for bricklayers' work upon the new Brass Foundry at Woolwich, and tbe following adver tisement was published in the London Gazette of July 10th, 1716 : \u2014 Whereas a Brass Foundery is now building at AVoolwich for His Majesty's Service, all founders as are desUous to cast brass ordnance are to give in their pro posals forthwith, upon such terms as are regulated by the prmcipal officers of His Majesty's Ordnance, which may be seen at their office in the Tower. Andrew Schalch. \u2014 In the month following appears an order direct ing that \u2014 If the results of enquiry prove satisfactory, Mr. Andrew Schalch shall be em ployed in building the furnaces, and providing of the Necessary UtensiUs for the Royal Foundry at Woolwich, at \u00a35 a Day, untill Everything is provided and his performances approved. Next in order comes his full appointment, October 5th, 1716 : \u2014 The Board having recJ. a letter from Mr. Leathes, his Majesty's Minister at Brussels, giving an acco'. that Mr. Andrew Schalk (sic) bears a good Character at Doway and was an able founder. Ordd. That the said Mr. Schalk be employed in the Royal Foundry at Woolwich at \u00a35 per diem from the 20th of Sepr. last. Andrew Schalch * was for the next sixty years the head in every sense of the national gun factory. He occupied an official residence in the Arsenal, the building in which the Ordnance Committee is now located, but removed to Charlton prior to his death, which took place in 1776 at tbe age of eighty-four years. He amassed an ample fortune. It is related of him that he would never suffer the furnaces to be opened until the workmen and spectators had joined with him in prayer. Mr. Schalch was buried in Woolwich churchyard, and lately a memorial window7 has been erected in the Garrison Church of St. George to the honour of him and his descendants, five of whom have been officers in the Royal Artillery. His two daughters married distinguished officers, * Some of Schalch's guns, cast in 1742, were, nearly a hundred years later (1840) recovered from the wreck of the Royal George."], [471, "WOOLWICH 323 Colonel Belson and Colonel Williamson, both of whom became Com mandants at Woolwich. The Old Foundry. \u2014 Next to the Tower Place, Schalch's foundry is the oldest building in the Royal Arsenal. It is thus described in the Quarterly Review for January, 1858 : \u2014 With a stately solemnity which marked the conceptions of its builder, Vanbrugh, stands the picturesque gun factory, with its high-pitched roof, red brickwork, and carved porch, looking like a fine old gentleman amid the factory ranges which, within these few years, have sprung up around. It is impossible to contemplate this building without respect, for forth from its portals have issued that victorious ordnance which, since the days of George II., has swept the battle-grounds of the old and new worlds. An Impetus. \u2014 The plan of 1717 is useful in showing us the Warren in the year of its first impulse, the gun foundry having just been introduced. It also shows us by a dotted line the boundary of the enclosure on the east side, a line which very nearly coincides with the present division of Woolwich and Plumstead. It will be seen that a public way led towards the river from Burrage House, and that the great gravel pit had spread its contagion across the highway, forming a deep hollow where we now find the main gate in Beresford Square. The position of the entrance in 1717 is not clear, but there appears to have been an opening from the old town in Warren Lane. This is not quite so apparent in Borgard's plan of 1701. Departmental Seniority. \u2014 The plan of 1717 establishes the seniority of the Gun Foundry next after the Laboratory and Carriage Yard ; but the Dial Square appears to have been built soon afterwards from plans by Sir John Vanbrugh, which are dated in the same year, (1716), and may be seen in tbe national museum. Officers' Quarters. \u2014 The buildings adjacent, now converted into officers' residences, were tbe barracks of the Royal Artillery. They are described in Barker's map (1749) as the \" Old \" and \" New ' ' Barracks, and the earliest block, which faces the river, was built in 1719, as appears by the dates on the leaden waterspouts. The First Lahoratory. \u2014 The primitive Laboratory was, however, already going to decay when these buildings were erected. General Borgard says in his diary \u2014 1717-18. \u2014 The Board came to a resolution to regulate what was wantmg to coin pleat a compleat Artillery, for sea and land service. I laid before the Board the ill state of the Laboratory, which the Board ordered me to put in some better order, and to be at as little expense as possible, which I cUd accordingly. Carriage Yard. \u2014 The Carriage Department was also in need of improvement, and the order of July 24th, 1716, which includes the"], [472, "324 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. \"building of the Foundery at Woolwich,\" provides also for making \" two wharfs over the moat near the new carriage yard at ditto.\" Extensions in Plumstead. \u2014 Among the old buildings are also the stables near the Plumstead Gate, for they have water-tanks marked 1720 and 1729. The ground on which they stand must have been acquired subsequently to 1717. They may have formed part of a private residence, or the water-tanks may have come from some other building. The stables appear to have been attached to the Store Receiver's house, which stood adjacent on the west.

The upper rooms were probably used as a dormitory for such of the Cadets as were \"boarders.\" A Chapel. \u2014 There was also a place of religious worship somewhere within the Arsenal boundary, but its position cannot yet be defined."], [473, "325 WOOLWICH. On the 24th of April, 1756, it was reported that \" the old chapel in the Warren was filled with bombs, grape, chain, and double-headed shot,\" specimens of which are now to be seen in the Laboratory. Historic Window. \u2014 Over the entrance-door of the old foundry was placed a stained-glass window, which remained there for many years. It is now to be seen in the Pattern Room of the Royal Gun Factories, whither it was removed about 1880. It represents King Edward III. and a group of his officers examining an early speci men of ordnance, which lies on tressels before him, with a pyramid of shot close by, while the foreground is occupied by an ancient bombard, with its breach shaped like a ram's head, as if to connect it with the still older battering implements of the ancients.

On a garter at the base is the inscription, \" King Edward III. inspecting his Artillery.\" The Dial Square. \u2014 There is some doubt as to the period at which the Dial Square was built. The sun-dial over the gate bears the date of 1764, and ought to be a reliable authority, but the building is plainly outlined on Barker's plan, 1748, and the front next the river is unmis takable in Birch's view of 1739, its castellated walls standing, as now, between the Carriage Square and the Laboratory. The design of the \" front gate \" and \" the great pile of buildings \" at the Tower Place, previously mentioned, both refer obviously to the Dial Square, and"], [474, "326 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. both are dated 1717, about which time the building was in all pro bability erected. The sun-dial is therefore misleading, and the date upon its face can only be accepted as a record of its own age. It may be assumed that the dial was an afterthought, subsequent to 1748, when the place was known as \" The Grand Square, or storehouse of artificers' shops.\" It is possible that the Grand Square was covered in as we now see it in 1764. Royal Military Academy. \u2014 Thus far we have followed the fortunes of the primitive arsenal down to the beginning of the eighteenth century, and seen its first important outgrowth from the Tower Place. To that same focus our attention is drawn for some time longer. Full twenty years after the reconstruction of the building it continued to be used as official quarters; but when the advancement of gunnery called for a special education the ample apartments of the Tower House were fixed upon as most suitable and appropriate for the purpose, Accordingly, in 1741, we find tbe historic structure converted into the View from Rupert's Walk, 1749. nursery of the Royal Military Academy, and The Gentleman's Magazine of that year thus announces the fact : \u2014 An academy is ordered to be built at Woolwich for instructing the gentlemen belonging to the train of artiUery. Like the history of the Royal Artillery, the associations of the Royal Academy run for a while collaterally with the records of the Royal Arsenal, but to all practical intents diverge from the progress of the manufacturing branches almost from their beginning. Being located together, and under one head, they cannot be wholly separated until a later period, but they must henceforth, in the main, be distinctly treated. More Batteries. \u2014 The Warren remained for many years a com bination of school, barracks, factory, and fortification, affording full play to the versatile genius of its master-mind, Borgard. Here he erected, upon the most scientific principles, two gun-batteries and a bomb-battery in 1737, the former mounting in all five guns, and the"], [475, "327 WOOLWICH. latter a single mortar only. This work has disappeared, and left no more sign than the earlier defences of Prince Rupert. Without further prefix, I may now introduce a few miscellaneous extracts from the public prints of the period : \u2014 1740. June 20. \u2014 Complaint having been made to the Lords of the AdmUalty that the gunpowder used by the three men-of-war when they took the Princessa was weaker than the powder taken in the said ship, in the proportion of seven to twelve, it was thought proper to make a pubUck tryal. In order thereto, some gunpowder was taken out of each of the above four ships, put into foul* boxes at Portsmouth, which were sealed up by some officers of the Navy and Ordnance, and sent to town and this day try'd at Woolwich before the D. of Montagu, Master-General of the Ord- nance, Sir Charles Wager, Lord Vere Beauclerk, General Borgard, some captains of men-of-war, &c, in three divers ways. 1. By raising a weight of 20 lbs. 7 oz. with 2 drams of powder. 2. By firing a twelve-pounder shot out ofa 5|-inch mortar with a quarter of an ounce of powder. 3. By firing a half-pound shot out of a swivel gun with 2 drams of powder. In the first experiment the English powder raised the weight from 4 inches to 6 and some tenths, and the Spanish no higher than 1 inch and 9 tenths. In proving by the swivel gun, the English powder threw the ball 152 feet at an elevation of 61 degrees, and the Spanish had not strength enough to throw it out of the gun ; and the tryal by the mortar turned out equaUy in favour of the English powder. Notwithstanding the above account, many persons who have been at Portsmouth affirm that the shot of the Princessa were much sharper thrown than those of our men-of-war, some of hers going through the sides of our ships when ours stuck in her half-way. 1741. February. \u2014 On Monday last a most melancholy accident happened at the Royal Foundry at Woolwich, where an old Bombshell which had some days before been landed from on board one of the Tenders, and whose charge had not been with- drawn, took fire, and bursting, it wounded six of the Matrosses so dangerously that two are since dead ; the third had both his legs and his right arm cut off ; and U the others should live, the surgeons are of opinion, That they never can recover the Use of all their Limbs. 1742. May 24. \u2014 The three battalions of Foot Guards embarked at Woolwich for Flanders. 1742. June 12. \u2014 There is at present the greatest quantity of large ordnance at Woolwich that has been known, which excites the curiosity of numbers of people and draws them thither. 1744. July 7.\u2014 Last Saturday his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland, attended by several persons of distinction, went to Woolwich, where the large mor- tars and cohorns lately cast there were prov'd, and were allowed by the officers present to be the finest ever cast. 1744. September 8. \u2014 An order is sent from the Board of Ordnance to the Foundery at Woolwich for the casting a great number of brass and iron cannon ; and for that purpose the ancient pieces that have lain there for some time are to be melted down. The Marquis of Granhy. \u2014 In 1764 there was a grand display of fireworks in honour of the Marquis of Granby's birthday, \" played off on the green at Woolwich Warren,\" as related with much circumstance in the St. James's Chronicle of that year. There was also displayed a transparency inscribed \" Long live Granby,\" and after the fireworks"], [476, "328 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. there was a dinner at the Ship Tavern, where Col. Williamson* pre sided, and most of the artillery officers were present. The Marquis of Granby, afterwards Duke of Rutland, was Lieute nant-General from 1759 to 1763, and Master-General 1763-72. In 1764 he reorganised the Royal Military Academy. He augmented the Cadet Company, and increased tbe allowance to each cadet from Is. 4rf. to 2s. 6d. per day. He also appointed superior professors, and improved The Marquis of Granby. the character of the institution by establishing a qualifying examina tion. In 1766 he instituted two gold and two silver medals as prizes of honour to the gentlemen cadets. The Marquis, who was also com mander-in-chief of the army, was born in 1721, and died in 1770 from a sudden attack of gout in the stomach. With a brilliant career as a soldier he combined a most generous character. One who served with him has written of him \u2014 Oft have I seen his hand stretched out to supply the wants of the needy soldier ; * Colonel George Williamson, R.A., became a general officer in 1762, and died at Woolwich in 1781. He ought not to have been described as a colonel in 1764."], [477, "WOOLWICH. 329 nor did the meanest follower of his camp go hungry from his door. His table was hospitality itseU, and his open countenance gave a hearty welcome to all his guests. On the other hand, the Marquis had the misfortune to be terribly criticised in the famous \" Letters of Junius.\" He was very partial to Woolwich, and his name repeatedly appears in the chronicles as a visi tor both before and after his appointment to the head of the Ordnance. There is still a tavern near tbe Arsenal bearing his name. Progress and Change. \u2014 To realise the extent and character of the Royal Arsenal at this period of its history, it is needful to examine minutely the plan of Mr. John Barker, as reproduced on page 40. The \"old\" and \"new\" \"carriage yards\" which figure in Borgard's map of 1701 (Plate XXXIII.) disappear in Barker's plan, and the moat, formed with so much care, had become obsolete. The Laboratory, Dial, and Carriage Squares had been formed, compact and regular, but the old foundry stood in its old corner, and there was nothing else. The Dial and Laboratory Squares were still open and but partly built, and a foun tain played in the centre of each.* The Laboratory yard and Tower Place (the Royal Military Academy) were not enclosed. The present officers' quarters were the \" old\" and \" new Artillery Barracks,\" and the gate of the Royal Arsenal was a narrow porchway in a recess thirty yards to the west of the opening which we now have. The Nightingale Valley brook ran through the Warren from the sandpits ; the practice butt was just beyond it (near the site of the shell foundry), where it had been built forty years earlier. Gravel-pits and marshes made up the rest, and ploughed fields abutted against tbe eastern boundary, which may now be marked by a line stretching from the corner of Burrage Road to the T Pier.t Rupert's wall is seen extending along the em bankment of the river, and two batteries, probably those constructed by Borgard, project. Standing precisely where it has done to this day, is \" the flag that's braved a thousand years,\" but there is very little else that has not undergone a transformation. In Buck's view (Plate III.) there are seen three guns at the flagstaff, and some distance in the rear the north walls of the Carriage Department and Dial Square. The Laboratory is partly hidden, but the Tower is conspicuous, and three turrets stand boldly out. The two other turrets I am not able to explain. They are not shown in Barker's sketch from Rupert's walk at page 326. * The south portion of the Dial Square, which was first erected, was called the \" Bason Square,\" and its fountain is represented hy a cUcular figure. Fountains were not unusually introduced for ornamental purposes in the courts of workshops, as well as of dwelUng-places, in the early part of the eighteenth century. t The map of 1717 shows the boundary Une of the Warren identical with the parish boundary, which enters at the Ordnance Chapel and emerges close to the T pier. This was the fuU extent of the Warren until 1777."], [478, "330 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Mr. John Barker, to whom we are so much indebted, was an instructor at the Royal Military Academy. A Flourishing Place. \u2014 Austin, vicar of Hoo, writing of Wool wich about this time (1762), says : \u2014 Besides ye building yard, here is a large ropewalk where the biggest cables are made for men-of-war, and on ye east or lower part of the town is ye Gun Walk or Yard, commonly called ye Park, or the Gun Park, where there is a prodigious quantity of cannon of all sorts. Here is also ye house where ye firemen and engineers prepare their fireworks to charge bombs, carcases, and grenadoes for ye public service. The town of late years is much enlarged and also beautified. It is indifferently built, but the fine yard and docks make it a flourishing place. That place which is caUed the Warren is the most pleasing to a traveller's eye. To ye eastward of ye buildings is a mount where ye train of artillery try or scale their cannon. \u2014 MS. in British Museum. Another Fire. \u2014 The Annual Register of 1766 tells us that in August of that year \u2014 A fire broke out in the Laboratory, Woolwich Warren, which burnt very furiously for some time, but was at last extinguished by the carpenters and matrosses belonging to the Warren. A man who was at work when the fire began was burnt to death. Gunpowder Trials. \u2014 The same journal, under date of September 11, 1767, says: \u2014 The following warlike experiments are said to have been lately made at Woolwich by Mr. Cross, and were found to answer, but are not adopted, for particular reasons : 1. To fix gunpowder under the earth, and when trod upon to be blown up. 2. To fix gunpowder under a gate, and when opened wiU be blown up. 3. To fix gunpow der under the earth, and by lifting up anything that he may lay thereon, will be blown up. 4. To fix gunpowder under the greatest budding on London side of the Thames, Mr. Cross will stand the opposite side and blow it up without using match or train. He has brought to perfection also a moving battery, which is to be drawn by horses and is to be made use of in time of battle, when fifty men can withstand a thousand firing cannon, small arms, grenades, &c. The Old Foundry in 1887."], [479, "George III. CHAPTER XXIX. BAPTISM OF THE EOYAL AKSENAL. The First Royal Record. \u2014 It is not until the year 1773 that we have recorded the first visit to the Royal Arsenal of a sovereign of England, but it would be rash to assume that the important works which had been in operation here for more than half a century had not been previously recognised by the reigning monarch. The date was July 6th, 1773, and the King was therefore George III.* A news paper thus describes the event : \u2014 On Tuesday last the King arrived at this place (Woolwich). At a Uttle before ten in the morning his Majesty entered the Warren (preceded by twenty -four rope makers dressed in white with round hats decorated by ribbons, who had run before his Majesty's carriage from Blackheath) attended by a party of the light horse. His Majesty stepped out of his carriage and was received by Lord Townsend as Master- General of the Ordnance, on the Parade, when he was saluted by a discharge of twenty-one twelve-pounders. The guard rested theU arms, and the drums and music beat the march ; the royal standard was displayed on the mortar battery, and every window filled with ladies. His Majesty passed in front of the old invaUds and the guard, to the new-erected foundery ,t where Mr. Van Bruggen shewed His Majesty the various progressions of casting brass guns, such as the preparation of the clay forming the moulds, fixing the trunnions, and the motion of the fire in the * The visit of James II.

The boring was done by horse labour, as shown by a model in the Rotunda museum."], [480, "332 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. furnaces, occasioned by the subterraneous gaUeries that convey an uncommon blast of wind from every quarter. The King then entered the boring-room, for boring guns cast solid, by an horizontal boring machine, extremely curious and well contrived (likewise the work of Mr. Van Bruggen) where a forty-two-pounder was bored in his Majesty's presence. From the foundry his Majesty went through the gun walk to the mortar-battery, and saw several shells thrown from mortars of various diameters both for land and sea service ; some ricochet granadoes were like wise thrown from howitzers. From thence his Majesty went to the Royal Military Academy, * where he saw a very curious model of a fortification, together with the Unes of approach, parallels, and saps, explained in a very military-like manner by the inspector of the Academy, Capt. Smith, who is said to have been twelve years in the Prussian Service. His Majesty then viewed the drawings and other exercises of the Upper Academy, explained by Dr. PoUock, Professor of ArtiUery and Fortification; after which he returned into the grand room of the Academy, and was regaled with a breakfast and repast. Beanfeast. \u2014 The Beanfeast holiday which is annually observed at the Royal Arsenal is probably attributable to the incident just men tioned. The traditionary origin of the \" Beanfeast \" is an incognito visit paid by this same king soon after his accession ; and we are asked to believe that his Majesty, having dined alfresco with a party of labourers on beans and bacon, instituted the annual beanfeast in remembrance of the occasion. The day on which it is held is always the second Saturday in July, which corresponds very nearly with the date of the visit in 1773. I have heard that the very warrant by which it was instituted was in existence not very long since, but it would be more satisfactory to see it. f Beanfeasts are known to be as old as civilisation ; there are records of them among the ancients, and they certainly belong to the category of old English customs. It is natural to suppose that at a time when there were no Bank Holidays, and when Coronation Day was in October, the boon of a midsummer day's recreation, enjoyed by most other workpeople, may have been bestowed upon the Royal Warren as a memento of this auspicious visitation, and took the national title of \" beanfeast.\" An Inventor. \u2014 In concluding the chronicles of this interesting period, I must mention Lieutenant John Bell, R.A., who died in 1794. He was born at Carlisle in 1747, and was the inventor of many in genious mechanical appliances, one of the simplest of which is still in use in the Royal Arsenal, being the method of breaking up guns and other old metal by the fall of a heavy ball. He also designed \" Bell's gyn,\" * At the Tower House. t It has been customary to destroy the departmental books when a few years out of date. Many of the early records relating to Woolwich were destroyed in the fire which took place at the Tower of London in 1841 ; many more were lost owing to the practice which once prevailed of allowing the higher officials of the War Depart- ment to take away their letter-books on resigning office."], [481, ""], [482, "[To face page 333.

The Middle Age.\u2014 Our records now approach more modern times, and the plenteous materials at command require some selection. They have already pointed to the approaching flight of the Military Academy and Artillery Barracks from their nestling quarters, and in a few years after we find them both taking wing. The Second Academy. \u2014 The Company of Cadets was augmented by the King at one stroke from forty to one hundred, in the month of January, 1778, and, the Tower Place being overfull, the newer Academy eastward of the gate was erected. This range of buildings (shown at Plate XXXIV.) is now used as officers' residences, a school, and the Arsenal Institute, but they were occupied, -wholly or in part, by the cadets until 1850, and the green in front was honeycombed by them in the practice of constructing mines, parapets, parallels, approaches, batteries, and magazines. This green seems to have been better preserved when this picture was drawn (1789), and was encircled by a road, which the carriage in the distance is following to reach the gate. The open space is probably a remnant of the original \" Woolwich Green,\" and still exists as a lawn in front of the Carriage Department Pattern Room. Departure of the Cadets. \u2014 This, the second Academy, did not flourish for much more than twenty years, and was for a short time entirely vacated, when the present Academy was built. It is stated in the \" Beauties of England and Wales,\" that in 1806 \u2014 The building which was recently the Royal Military Academy is unappropriated, the Cadets having very recently removed to the new building on the common. Here Mrs. Simpson, reUct of the celebrated mathematical professor, died at the great age of one hundred and two. She was buried at Plumstead. Tbe building was afterwards reoccupied by the senior class of Cadets, and finally evacuated in 1850. f The Royal Artillery. \u2014 Still more rapidly the Royal Artillery outgrew its shell. The two wings which form a right angle at the south-east corner of the Dial Square were one after another provided, but the regiment had swollen almost beyond their capacity by the middle of the eighteenth century, and I believe that at one time a portion of the corps was quartered in the range of buildings which now forms * Page 279. + See \" Records ofthe Garrison.\" Y"], [484, "334 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. the face of the Laboratory. The regiment was transferred to the new barracks on the Common in 1775, and their old residence was converted into officers' quarters, which they still remain. Ordnance Stores. \u2014 Towards the end of the last century, the bulk of the Ordnance stores, which had theretofore been kept at the Tower of London, were transferred to the Arsenal, the present immense ware houses of the Ordnance Department being then built. Up to that time, the original level of the ground had been little altered. The open stream ran through and formed the moat as of old, and most ofthe area Ordnance Church, drawn in 1830. was a marsh- swamp. There was the wharf at the Laboratory end of the river front, and the three squares of buildings \u2014 Laboratory, Gun Factory, and Carriage Department \u2014 were in position ; but eastward of the stream were marsh meadows, still depending upon the protection of the ancient embankment of the Thames, while the snipe and rabbit, retained an interest in most of the soil. With the creation of the Ordnance Store Department, came, however, a great change. The wharf, from the octagon guard-houses to the coal-dock, was con structed, chiefly by convict labour, and the level of the whole space enclosed by the buildings was raised, except in two or three places,"], [485, "WOOLWICH. 335 which seem to have been left to show the original depression.* These may he seen just within the main gates on the right, and at the stables behind the officers' quarters. Later, when the area was extended, and the higher level was carried to the canal, another exception was made of the orchard now known as \" the Colonel's Garden,\" and the adjoining space occupied by the composition buildings of the East Laboratory, which appear to possess their original surfaces. Sandhy's Sketch. \u2014 If we refer now to Sandby's \" View from Woolwich Warren,\" at page 23, we shall find a difficulty in fixing the standpoint ; but as the church seen in the left-hand corner can have been no other than the parish church of Woolwich, the prospect is certainly up-river, and consequently the portion from which it was taken must be somewhere near the curve of the \"bight.\" I have con jectured that the artist stood below the site of the boat-house, and ancient mariners tell me that thereabout in their time stood a number of trees, which may have formed the orchard or other enclosure depicted in this pretty drawing, the date of which may be fixed at about 1775. Higher Consequence. \u2014 The increasing importance of the place at the beginning of the present century is mentioned by various writers. \" Pennant's Journey,\" of 1801, says : \u2014 The ships launched here and at Deptford take in their guns from the magazine of artillery established at this place. The guns of every ship are placed apart in terrific order ; the heavy cannon for batteries and the mortars and shells and balls piled in elegant forms complete the tremendous scene. It was a compUment equally line and just which the poet payed to Charles IL, possibly on this very spot \u2014 Had the old Greeks discovered your'abode, Crete had not been the cradle of their god ; On that small island they had looked with scorn, And in Great Britain thought the thunder born. In the Universal Magazine, 1803, the establishment is thus de scribed : \u2014 There is a large Ropewalk, where cables are made for men-of-war, and in the lower part of the town is the Gun Yard, commonly called the Park, or the Gun Park where are cannon of all sorts for ships of war ; every ship's guns lying in tiers, or rows apart ; heavy cannon for batteries, and mortars of all sizes, so that there have been laid up here at once between seven and eight thousand pieces of ordnance, * In digging the foundation for the DUector-General's offices, opposite the Medical Establishment, in June, 1888, the workmen disclosed, eight feet underground, a rect- angular wall, which was traced sixty feet north by eighty feet east. It was about eighteen inches thick, three feet high, and finished at the top, upon which had evidently stood a wooden erection. The site was almost identical with that of the Firework Barn in Borgard's map (Plate XXXIII.), but the dimensions will not agree, and it was probably the remnant of a later building. Under the eight feet of artificial earth a halfpenny was found bearing the date 1777, which will give us approximately the date of the altered level. Y 2"], [486, "336 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. besides mortars and shells without number. There is both a civil and a military branch of the Office of Ordnance estabUshed at Woolwich. The civil branch is under the management of a storekeeper, clerk of the survey, clerk of the cheque, clerk of the foundry, and other officers, who have many inferior servants and workmen under them. The military branch of the Office of Ordnance is under the dUection of a chief engineer, who ranks as colonel ; two dUectors, who rank as Ueutenant colonels ; and four sub-directors, as majors. The engineers in ordinary rank as cap tains, the engineers extraordinary as captain-lieutenants, and the sub-engineers as lieutenants ; beside which, are several practitioner engineers. Under this office, in a place called the Warren, artillery of all kinds and dimensions are cast, which, before the budding of the powder magazine at Purfleet, were usually proved here, in the presence of the principal engineers and officers of the Board of Ordnance, to which many of the nobility and gentry are invited, and sumptuously entertained by them. The gunpowder which is contracted by the Office of Ordnance is proved here, with regard to its strength and goodness, and its fitness for the pubUc service. There is besides a laboratory belonging to this office, under the direction of a controUer, a chief fire-master, a fire-master's mate, a clerk, and other workmen and labourers. The companies of matrosses are employed in making fireworks and cartridges, and in charging bombs, carcases, and grenadoes. Change Of Name.- \u2014 George III., whose earlier visit has been men tioned, was again at the Warren in 1805, and the occasion is remarkable as it gave rise to the name of \" The Royal Arsenal.\" The circumstance is thus narrated in the Gentleman's Magazine, under date of Thursday, July 27th, 1805 :\u2014 The Ordnance Board have signified to General Lloyd, who commands the artillery at Woolwich, that the Warren at that place is no longer to bear that name ; but from this time to be denominated the \" Royal Arsenal ! \" The old name had its origin from the place having actually been a rabbit warren, but the name of one of the tamest of aU animals was certainly ill-suited to the nature of the place. On the recent Royal visit to what is called the Warren, where all ordnance, stores, ammuni tion, &c, are lodged, His Majesty noticed how Uttle appropriate the name was to the place, and suggested the propriety of changing it to that of \" Arsenal.\" * The Master- General admitted the justice of the idea, and instantly adopted it ; henceforward therefore,, in compliment to His Majesty's suggestion, the Warren is to be caUed \" the Royal Arsenal.\" A portion of the Arsenal was, however, known as the Warren as recently as 1837, the edict of the King applying only to the foundry, gun-wharf, powder magazine, and other buildings at the western end.f * Etymology : arx navalis, whence the Romaunt arthenal, signifying primarily a \" naval citadel.\" The term \" arsenal \" is not so modern as its appUcation.

ENLARGING THE ROYAL ARSENAL. Extension. \u2014 It appears to have been in the year 1777 that the great enlargement of the place was carried out by the purchase of additional land from the Dowager Lady Wilson and Sir Thomas Wilson, Bart.* There is an order extant dated 1779, from the Master- General of the Ordnance to the Governor of the Royal Military Academy, requiring \"a plan of Woolwich Warren, with all the buildings in the state they were in before the ground was purchased of Sir Thomas Wilson, and a plan in its present state with all the additions marked.\" This was probably needed to show the second cadet-barracks. The old Warren we have seen consisted of only forty-two acres, but this enlargement made it about a hundred acres, aud forty acres more were added before 1810. Both these additions were necessarily in the parish of Plumstead. t Accidents. \u2014 It may be remarked that the turn-out of work was not a fiftieth part of the present production, but the proportion of mishaps was many times as great. The following are reported by the journals and other authorities of the period : \u2014 1770. March 9th. \u2014 Yesterday there was a grand proof of brass mortars and about a hundred large iron cannon in our Warren. The mortars aU appeared full proof, and discharged the balls to a very great distance in the river, signals being hoisted at different points to caution the shipping to keep out of the way ; but two ot the cannon burst into pieces and were forced into different parts of the Warren, but providentially no damage was done, nothwithstanding a great many spectators were present. 1779.

June 30th (Sunday). \u2014 At 9.45 p.m. a fire broke out in the store department and consumed two wooden storehouses, two storeys high and nearly a hundred and seventy feet long, filled with boxes of grape and canister, and about half a million boxes were destroyed. The Royal Artillerymen were turned out to prevent the destruction of the magazine, and to save the clothing store, which contained more than eight thousand suits. They covered the roof of the magazine with wet blankets, &c, till it was out of danger, though the heat was so great that the men were obliged to be played on by the engines to preserve them from fainting. The two buildings consumed were behind the moat ; not a vestige remains. The fire was not the effect of accident, as it burst out in five different places at once, and the stores were locked up by the proper officers on Saturday and not opened on Sunday. 1805. \u2014 The great magazine for holding powder was this year destroyed as a precaution against accidents, and all the gunpowder kept for the use of the artUlery departments deposited in small vessels anchored near the Royal Arsenal, and thence transferred to magazines erected in the marshes. \u00a7 1813. September 2nd. \u2014 A fire broke out in the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich on Monday, owing to the folly of a workman employed in the building caUed the Dipping Square. A female expressing a wish to see a rocket star, the man to gratUy her curiosity let one off in his hand, which coming in contact with the fire, he threw it down, and it communicated to some combustible materials. Happily no Uves were lost and the fire was subdued in about an hour. 1814. June 20th. \u2014 An unfortunate explosion took place in the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, in one of the sheds appropriated for making fireworks ; in consequence of which four of the workmen lost their lives, and two others were wounded. By the exertions of the officers on the spot, the fire was prevented from injuring any of the other buildings, and it was entirely got under in less than half an hour. Some more recent explosions will be dealt with separately, but there have been few fires of recent years worth comment. On January 28th, 1855, the Lancaster Shell Foundry was destroyed by fire, but such are the precautions now taken that for a number of years past there have been no fire records except a few important \" stops,\" one which threatened most being in the old building of which tbe Labora tory Drawing Office formed part and another in the Royal Carriage Department Store. * Discontent and disaffection were hereditary failings in the Government works, but at this time the workmen were treated with much greater consideration than formerly. In this same year (1S02) an Act of Parliament was passed, by which the men in the Warren were exempted from serving in the Militia. (42 Geo. III. Cap. 90, Sec. 43.) t Tower Place. X The model of Gibraltar is now in the Rotunda. It was constructed by two privates of the corps of artificers, Richmond and Bland, who for their extraordinary quickness at the siege of Gibraltar obtained the names of \"Shot\" and \"Shell.\" Commissions were afterwards granted to both of them for their good services. \u00a7 Lysons' Supplement, 1811."], [489, "WOOLWICH. 339 A Mischance Repeated. \u2014 Two events of the accident order, one earlier and one later, should be narrated together. They are in point of date a hundred and ten years apart, but their resemblance is remark able. The proof in the first paragraph was on the old ground near the Carriage Square. The butts in the second case are the butts in the practice range below the canal. 1742. \u2014 On Friday there was a proof of iron ordnunce at Woolwich, when a 24-pdr. burst, and a piece of metal about 4 cwt. flew near 300 yards over the heads of the people, and fell upon the top of a chimney of a house adjoining the founder's, broke through the roof and through three stories down to the ground floor, and providentially did no other mischief. The gun, in its agitation before bursting, turned that which lay next to it so as to point its muzzle towards the spectators and the storekeeper's house, and had it not struck out the portfire, which was lighted, great mischief would probably have ensued. 1852. February. \u2014 A proof of guns was taking place at the butts, several being placed side by side, double loaded, and made ready to be fired by slow match. The fuzes were ignited and the range party retired under cover. But the first gun to fire burst asunder, and turned the next gun in the direction of the town. When its charge ignited, the shot flew into the aU over the*^ Arsenal and the streets of Woolwich, where it was seen and heard whizzing overhead, and finally descended, two miles away, through the roof and several floors of a house in the Dockyard, close to the gates. As it was just the dinner hour, some thousands of workmen were crowding out of the gates, but happily no one was injured. Some excuses may be found for disasters in the fact of the work being in so large a degree experimental and mostly done by hand labour. It was the age of invention, and, in tbe art of gunnery as in other directions, science was busy with new contrivances. Shrapnell Shell. \u2014 The Shrapnell shell was invented by Colonel Shrapnell in 1804, and he was granted \u00a31,200 by Parliament in recog nition of his valuable discovery. The shell was used on service for the first time in Spain by Colonel Robe, R.A., under command of Sir Arthur Wellesley, in 1808, and the enemy were considerably astonished at finding themselves exposed to a fire of musket balls at over a mile range. The shells were cast and perfected by Gunner John Henderson, R.A., who was afterwards appointed master founder at the Royal Arsenal at \u00a32 per diem, which post he held until his death, October 16th, 1826.* Rockets. \u2014 Rockets, from being merely pastime fireworks, were applied to the saving of life from shipwreck in 1809. 1809.

The Hale rocket, which dispenses with the use of a stick, was invented hy Mr. Hale, a mechanic in the Royal Arsenal, about 1845. Detonation. \u2014 The introduction of detonation in the firing of large guns is announced under date of \u2014 1840. September 11th.\u2014 A party of the Royal Artillery proceeded to the proof butt in the Royal Arsenal, on Friday, to try a plan for discharging large pieces of ordnance by a hammer and detonating powder, the present system being with a portfire ignited and kept burning until the word of command is given. The gun selected was a 32 pounder and 40 rounds were fired with great satisfaction. Tuhes and Fuzes. \u2014 The friction tube and time-fuze, which are still, like the Shrapnell shell and tbe life-saving rocket, in general use all over the world, were introduced to public notice in the following paragraphs : \u2014 1840. December 18th. \u2014 In October last four hundred percussion tubes for field guns, made according to a plan invented in Hanover, with twelve thongs for firing them, were issued to two field batteries at Woolwich. Two hundred common tubes used with portfire were also issued, with instructions that they should be fired at the same time. The expt-iments are now complete and favourable to the adoption of the new tubes. Out of two hundred fired, twenty of the wire plugs were drawn without igniting the percussion powder, two without igniting the cartridge, and six hung fire ; the remainder were all very good. 1841. September 17th. \u2014 Experiments were made at the mortar battery on the barrack-field with a newly invented fuzee for exploding shells at a given number of seconds after they have been projected from the mortars. The first six fired were thirteen inches in diameter, fitted on a principle invented by Mr. Marsh, chemist of the Royal Arsenal, the fuzee being in the form of a screw, the composition being placed in the hollows, and when ignited or discharged, burns at the rate of one inch in two seconds. Lieut.-Colonel Dansey, R.A., afterwards gave orders to fire three shells fitted with fuzees invented by him. The Arsenal Chemist. \u2014 Mr. Marsh, remembered hy old inhabi tants, and several times referred to in these records, is mentioned also in tbe following notice : \u2014 1839. April 29th. \u2014 A new flexible shell tube is to be tested on Sandwich Flats. It is the invention of Mr. James Marsh, chemist, 'Royal Arsenal assistant to Professor REFERENCE TO PLATE XXXY. Mr. James Marsh was born September 2nd, 1794. He studied chemistry with great success, and was employed for many years at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. He assisted the famous Dr. Faraday, who esteemed his talents highly. He was the inventor of the electro-magnetic apparatus, and received the large silver medal and thirty guineas from the Society of Arts on the 26th April, 1823. Also a test for detecting arsenic, for which he received a large gold medal on April 22nd 1836 ; also percussion tubes for ship's cannon, &c, receiving the large silver medal and _\u00a330 from the Board of Ordnance on June 12th, lb37. The Crown Prince of Sweden also sent to him a small silver medal in appreciation of his science generally. He was voted \u00a330 by the Government for his quill-tube, and he was appointed Ordnance chemist. He died in June, 1846, leaving a widow and two daughters (one of whom is Mrs. Hatton, of Bumhani, and the other Mrs. Cram, of Plumstead). The Government awarded the widow a small pension, and the nation promptly and spontaneously raised for her a subscription of \u00a3500."], [491, "PLATE XXXV Mr. James Marsh To face page 340"], [492, ""], [493, "341 WOOLWICH. Faraday. He is inventor also of a discovery for the detection of poison by arsenic, to the study of which he turned in consequence of the Bodie case, and for this the Society of Arts have awarded him their large gold medal. Mr. Marsh's salary in 1839 was but 30s. per week. The Momentum of 1840. \u2014 The Royal Arsenal was at this period (1840) making another move onward. Since the beginning of the great wars of the last century and the increase of the establishments in 1777 there had been little variation calling for particular notice. The Peninsular campaign and the struggle which culminated at Waterloo kept the place uniformly busy for a long series of years, and then came a long depression. The demand for war material necessarily declined with the prospects of a permanent peace, and the old and evil system of obtaining warlike stores by contract prevailed to a considerable extent. It is something to boast now that no iron gun was ever cast in the Royal Arsenal, but at the cast-iron period it was a sore point to see that all the cast-iron guns were made by private firms and sent to the Arsenal merely to be passed by the Inspector-General of Artillery. This officer was then in charge of the Brass Foundry (forerunner of the Gun Factories) and occupied a position equivalent to that of the present Superintendent. Before Steam. \u2014 The Brass Foundry in 1835 employed only ten men, but the Inspector of Artillery bad thirty- five others working under him apart from the foundry. The casting of those brass guns which were considered the beau ideal of artillery, and the boring mills in the Dial Square, with machinery worked by horse labour, are among the early recollections of our present generation. In 1835 the Carriage Department employed ninety- five men, working five days a week, and the Laboratory had upon its books a. hundred and thirty-six men and boys, all told. Possibly two hundred more may have been employed in the Storekeeper's Department, chiefly old pensioners, labouring about the wharves and warehouses. Cock's Guide Book of 1837 says : \u2014 The weight of the largest gun cast in the Arsenal is ninety cwt. Although a gun will require, however much the manufacture may be accelerated, eleven or twelve days to complete it, yet they are completed at the rate of one and a quarter per day, including Sundays. The mould is secured by being strongly bound with iron hoops and the gun is cast soUd. The next process is that of boring and turning, which are both performed at one time. A large \" bit \" of the diameter wanted is fixed, and against this the gun revolves, four horses being required to move it. The same authority adds : \u2014 During the late war the number of men and boys employed in the Laboratory alone amounted to nearly 2,500 ; there are not at the present time more than 500 engaged throughout the whole estabUshment.\" But 1840 witnessed a new development consequent on the rearma-"], [494, "342 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. ment of the Navy, in which the Admiralty at one stroke rendered obsolete 10,000 guns and carronades, and introduced the 32-pounder and the 8-inch shell gun. The guns, being cast iron, were still made by contract, until the institution of the Royal Gun Factory and the introduction of the Armstrong rifled gun about 1857-8. But orders for 14,000 guns, extending over fourteen years, even if put out to contract, required new carriages and equipments, and for these fourteen years the departments got an appreciable extension of work. In the ten years ending 1853-4 the wages paid annually in the manufacturing departments ranged from \u00a334,000 (in 1844-5) to \u00a372,000 (in 1848-9). The Steam Age. \u2014 Steam-power had in the meantime been intro duced, improved machinery adopted, and the organization of the several departments placed on such a footing that the Royal Arsenal was regarded as almost in a state of perfection, although, regarded from our present point of view, matters were in a comparatively crude condition. But in one or two features the Arsenal has undergone no change during the lifetime of the present generation. Wharf and Wall. \u2014 The west wharf and the great external wall of the Arsenal have stood from the earliest recollections of the oldest inhabitant, and it becomes a matter of some curiosity to know how they were brought into being, in place of the wooden fences and tbe river bank which formerly guarded the privileged ground on its several sides. It has been shown in the annals of the Ropery that the western wharf in front of the Laboratory existed from a very remote date, and I have just met with a complaint made by the ropemakers in 1665 of delays by reason of the wharf's condition, in consequence of which \" thirty eight feet of wharfing at the crane in the gun-yard \" were ordered to be repaired. But this small wharf, reaching no farther than the first causeway or steps opposite the Laboratory offices, sufficed for all requirements until quite late in the eighteenth century, as may be seen by the drawings (pp. 4 and 40). The line of the original \" sea-wall \" is distinctly shown in a plan of the Thames prepared by Captain Bullock, R.N.,* in 1831 (Crace collection), and appears about fifty feet in rear of the present wharf frontage. But, strictly speaking, this line should represent the edge of the land, there having been no artificial embankment except at the lower part of the Royal Arsenal, where it assimilated with the marshes. In front of the Ordnance Storehouses, until the wharves were erected, the tide washed up the gravel beach to the walls of the buildings. * Captain (afterwards Admiral) BuUock, Uved for a number of years in a house which he built at Cantwell Road, Shooters' Hill."], [495, "343 WOOLWICH. The Convicts. \u2014 The wharves were the work of convicts, and found them in useful employment for many years. We have seen that extensive improvements date from about 1777, all of which are due to these felon hands, and the Parliamentary Journals of 1778 speak of \u2014 The mortaUty among the convicts in consequence of working ashore below Wool wich \" making an embankment for the Board of Ordnance in a piece of marsh ground adjoining the Warren, and also a ditch, a mote, and a proof butt.\" Proof Butt. \u2014 The proof butt was at this time removed from the position in which we have seen it (near the Carriage Department) * to a remoter spot, on the site of the Gun Factory's\" with a range of 560 yards extending down N.E.E. from the Plumstead Road, where there was a martello tower, close to the site of the R. C. D. sawmills. Coal Dock. \u2014 It is evident that the wharf was not at first meant to be carried farther eastward than the coal dock. This recess, which is now sheltered by the left arm of the iron pier, was then at the extremity of the Arsenal, and is the outlet of a drain which may be conjectured to have formed the dock at its estuary ; at any rate, the dock was there before the wharf. Colonel Mudge, in a letter dated May 1, 1810, says that a new wharf was built in 1809, and supplied with cranes for lifting ship's ordnance, and we read later that the wharf was continued east ward to the coal dock and completed in 1811. The allied sovereigns landed at the \"new wharf\" of the Royal Arsenal in 1814. Although it was not finished when the Ordnance map (p. 62) was drawn in 1810, this shows the wall and coal dock in their perfect state, and marks three projections beyond, which were probably the causeways which remain at the boat-house, and were in use for the Government ferry. The Canal. \u2014 But we find no sign of the Arsenal canal in this plan, and nobody I have ever met could tell me when this canal was cut. I searched in vain for its date, until I found in an old volume of the Arch\u0153ologia (7-412), a description of an elegant brass sword dug up in the summer of 1798, \" in the great marsh adjoining to Woolwich Warren, on making the boundary canal to the ground purchased for enlarging the Warren.\" The canal, therefore, was one of the works carried out by the convicts at the end of last century. The remainder of the wharf building was accomplished by instalments, the next extension after the enclosure of the coal dock embracing the frontage as far as the boathouse, the site of which was then occupied by the convicts' laundry, standing beside the causeway at which the prisoners landed from the hulks. The Justitia hulk lay just below this and the Warrior a little above, opposite tbe Laboratory. A third ship was employed as a hospital. * See Barker's map, page 40. t See Ordnance map, page 62."], [496, "344 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Convict Burials. \u2014 The gloomy story of the convict establishment is told elsewhere, but the mention of the subject recalls vivid recollec tions of the frequent burials of the poor wretches close to this spot. The bodies were brought ashore at the causeway as soon as the coroner and jury had done with them ; a hole, not too deep, was dug, and, with not too much ceremony, tbe rough deal coffins were thrust out of sight. It was generally believed that as soon as night fell the corpses were removed by body-snatchers, but many skeletons have been discovered by the builders in later years. All round about the old butts was marsh in 1850, and the \" colonel's garden \" was the \" convicts' garden,\" in which they grew their vegetables. The butts were taken beyond the The Proof Butts at the Practice Range canal when the Royal Gun Factories were built in 1855, and now new butts for the proof of guns have been provided quite outside the Arsenal wall. In our illustration the two principal bays of the butts at the inner range are depicted, and the electric screens which are employed to measure the velocity of projectiles are seen to the front. At these two bays, which are filled with sand, all the important gunnery trials and experiments of the last forty years have taken place. The Ferry. \u2014 The military ferry at the boathouse just mentioned was established shortly prior to 1810, and the landing on the north is spoken of as \" Duval's Point,\" but, as it still exists, there is no difficulty"], [497, ""], [498, "PLATE XXXVI. Embarking Horses for the Crimea, 1854. [To face page 345. J"], [499, "345 WOOLWICH. in locating it close to the Bargehouse. At the same time the road was made from the ferry to East Ham, where it joined the highway to Romford. The East Wharf. \u2014 Very old men remember the making of the east wharf, and tbe reed bed which occupied the river front below the boathouse is well within their recollection. The canal, being first em banked, was made useful in the raising of the surface about this part of the Arsenal. Most of the material came from the excavation of St. Katherine's Docks, and barges discharged it at the canal side. The convicts also dredged mud from the shoals in the river and poured it in behind the wharf wall, which was built in a great measure of clay dug from the foreshore. This, the east, wharf was probably constructed chiefly for the purpose of employing the convicts, for it was very little used for very many years. The Arsenal Piers. \u2014 Both the existing piers of the Royal Arsenal were built long subsequent to the erection of the wharves. When there were no piers at the Arsenal it was customary to send stores off to ships in the river by means of lighters or small boats, and the whole of the horses despatched from Woolwich to the Crimea in 1854 were hoisted on board by derricks from the yard-arm opposite the Dockyard and Arsenal. The First Pier. \u2014 In 1855-6 the T-pier was constructed, but for a short time previously the Royal Laboratory had provided for its own urgent needs a wooden projection, jutting out from the western end of the wharf opposite the saw-mills. The need of some such provision had been acutely felt during the war pressure, and, for the special advantage of the Laboratory, the temporary pier was fitted with troughs for rolling tbe spherical shot and shell from the factory on board ship. This system of loading, however, did not answer, and the pier was of so insufficient a character that it was condemned and demolished when the T-pier was opened in 1856. The T-Pier. \u2014 This pier, which is chiefly of timber, has been of immense service to the Royal Arsenal, especially in times of emergencies, but the birth of the \" Woolwich Infant \" of thirty-five tons, and the still more enormous giants of later years, urgently demanded some more adequate provision for their necessities. The Iron Pier. \u2014 In 1864, the Royal Engineer Department commenced the new iron pier opposite the Royal Gun Factories, and it was to some extent ready for use in the following year, but the increasing weight of heavy ordnance required an accession of strength and dimensions, and it was completed in its present form and opened in 1872. The one-hundred-ton crane upon it has since had its power"], [500, "346 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. increased to a hundred and thirty tons, and the whole structure is now regarded by experts as one of the most perfect of its kind in the world. The cylinders and other castings were made in the Royal Gun Fac tories. Before the Piers. \u2014 Unlike the East Wharf, the West Wharf has been a most valuable possession, especially prior to the creation of the piers. In 1811 we read that \u2014 On the new wharf are a considerable number of cranes for loading ordnance store ships, and so greatly has this improved the former means of fitting out the artUlery department, as well as that of the engineers, that within eight days aU the ordnance transports attached to the fleet for the Copenhagen expedition were completely ready and dropped down to the Gallions. A noble range of storehouses, constituting three sides of a square, has been built opposite to this wharf, and it is appropriated to the purpose of receiving carriages for service. A very important branch of business, called the Royal Carriage Department, is now carried on in the Arsenal to a great extent ; and for this purpose a great number of large shops have been built here since the year 1805, in which all the gun carriages for the army and navy are made. This important estabUshment is under the dUection of a comptroller, or head inspector, assisted by two deputies. Some buUdings forming a small quadrangle have been erected within the Arsenal for the Engineers Department. At this time (1811) we also read \u2014 The Commandant of the Garrison resides in the Arsenal, and the Lieutenant- Governor of the Academy, but there are now no barracks for soldiers. The whole extent of the Arsenal is now about a hundred and forty acres. The chief officers of the Arsenal are a storekeeper, clerk of the cheque, clerk of the survey, &c. The number of labourers employed in time of war, as at present, varies betw-een 4,000 and 5,000* The Outer Wharf. \u2014 Below the canal the wharf, in its new exten sion, has been the growth of many years' accumulations of cinders and other refuse from the furnaces and workshops, and several acres of valuable surface have thus been reclaimed from the useless foreshore. The butts .at the practice range, so long in use for proof and experimental purposes, are one more monument of prison labour, and much of the soil of which the mound is composed was dug from the surrounding marsh. The Practice Range. \u2014 Between 1850 and 1860 the inner range was commonly used for rocket and gun practice, but when the proof moved hither the outer range in the marshes was acquired and the practice butts built there. I clip the following paragraph, concerning the outer range, from a newspaper of \u2014 Sept. 1840. \u2014 The Ordnance authorities wish to obtain a more extensive practice range, the present one being so limited and in such close proximity to the river as to * In 1796, according to Lysons, there were about fifteen hundred men and three hundred boys employed in the Arsenal, and the convicts in addition. The making of canvas bags for the use of the Warren furnished employment also for many poor women."], [501, "347 WOOLWICH. be dangerous to the shipping. The intention is to continue the range eastward across the marshes toward Erith about three miles. Queer Fancies. \u2014 We have many amusing notions in the sug gestions our forefathers were accustomed to make in the exercise of that time-honoured custom, \" writing to the papers.\" One gentleman who visited Woolwich in 1798 thus delivered himself in the Gentle man's Magazine. Rejoicing at the escape the King's Ropeyard at Woolwich had from being destroyed by fire a few days ago, I was sorry to find how easily I was admitted into the Warren, by enquiring for a gentleman I might not even know or wish to see. When we consider how many disappointed and disaffected vagabonds are about this country, I think Government should be more vigilant. On my return the number of artificers entering the Warren surprised me. How easy a thing it is, said I to myself, to destroy this arsenal ! Should not every man wear a numbered badge, referring to a book describing his age and figure ; so that, when a suspected person enters, the sentry may assist to detect the fraud ? It would be easj** for a man, knowing all or most of the artificers, to sit at the gate during egress and ingress. This, with a parti cular jacket for the different branches in which they are employed, would go far towards detection. The Outer Boundaries. \u2014 Until 1844, the Arsenal was entirely in charge of the Military ; in that year, and for some years after, the police and the sentries had joint custody. In 1861, all but a small guard of the Military were withdrawn, but not until 1880 were the police in absolute charge. This reference to the means of protection on the land- side brings us again to the wall. From the old maps it would seem that there was at first only a wooden fence about the Arsenal, and the earliest refer ence to a brick wall which I have met with is contained in an order to the Cadets by General Belford,* as follows : \u2014 1758. \u2014 If any cadet shall presume to go out of the Warren, either over the wall or any other way, after tattoo, he shall be punished and dismissed the regiment. The* wall, however, was not then complete. When the before-men tioned extension took place, and the convicts were brought on the scene, we read : \u2014 1777. Sept. \u2014 The place where the convicts are now at Work near Woolwich Warren is enclosing on the Land Side with a Brick Wall, so that spectators will soon (if not abeady) be barred the Sight of those miserable Wretches on the Land Side except at a distance. A Pitiful Story. \u2014 A humorous illustration is in evidence regard ing this 6ame wall in this same year. There were two of the Academy \" professors,\" quartered in the corner of the Warren next Plumstead Road, and one of them had an outer door * It was this same governor who issued the order of 8th April, 1757, that, \"The first Cadet that is found swimming in the Thames shall be taken out naked, and put in the guard-room.\""], [502, "348 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. leading through the wall into the public thoroughfare, while the other had none. Consequently the professor minus the back door was an envious, discontented, and unhappy man, and he sent a plaintive letter to the Governor of the Academy, praying either that he too might have an outer door or the privilege of going through his neighbour's house. His sorrowful case must be set forth in his own words : \u2014 For want of such a ready communication with the town of Woolwich, with regard to my family, I am subject to much inconvenience. For the way by the gate of the Warren makes the distance to and from my house so great that I can't have the necessary provisions brought to me as other people have, by bakers, butchers, milkmen, &c, without great additional expense, and many not even for that at any rate. So that I am obliged to send my servants round about by all that way on all occasions to bring in all things necessary to the family. This is not the worst of it ; for ali kinds of family necessaries not being constantly to be bought in the shops in such a place as Woolwich, many things are brought only occasionally and cried about the streets, when it is a matter of no small grief that such things as may then be much wanted in the family can be heard to be cried immediately behind the house, without a possibility of coming at them, but by going half a mile round about, when perhaps the servants can be least spared to go ; and when they do go it is ten to one they are disappointed by the crier then being gone quite out of sight and hearing. And besides all this, it is not always that I can prevail on my good and sober female servants to be willing so frequently to go through by the Warren Gate, as it is next to an impossibility that such persons can pass so many soldiers as are generally there assembled without sometimes being subject to rencounters disagreeable to them. Why SO High ? \u2014 Tbe Warren wall was not more than eight feet high until 1804, when it was raised to its present, height. A burglary committed at the officers' quarters, in 1803, is said to have been the immediate cause of this precaution, but the safe custody of the convicts and the protection of the Government stores were doubtless the prime motives. The Arsenal wall in its greatest elevation, along the Plum stead Road, is twenty feet high. In other parts it diminishes to fifteen feet, and in some to twelve feet. An Extinct Gate at Plumstead. \u2014 There are plain evidences in all men's sight of the old gate opposite Maxey Road. It was about ten feet wide and had an arch lofty enough to admit a loaded waggon. As the Storekeeper's house stands to the east, the Store Receiver's house stood to the west of this gate, but was pulled down about 1820. Old Borders. \u2014 Until 1857 the canal was the extreme boundary of the Arsenal, and the inner practice range was barely enclosed from Plumstead Road, a hedge and a five-barred gate being the only protec tion. Tbe extent of the older wall is plainly seen a little beyond tbe Storekeeper's house and garden, now occupied by the Storekeeper's successor, the Commissary-General of Ordnance."], [503, "349 WOOLWICH. Cole Fields. \u2014 Until 1856 a triangular block of houses, known as Cole Fields, was wedged into the Government ground opposite Vicarage Road, having a road beside the receding wall from the main highway to the Canal, and this wall, which we can see from the top of the tram car, forms now an inner fence. Cole Fields boasted two taverns, the Dover Castle (now on the opposite side), and the British Flag, the fore runner of the Standard in Ann Street. The Arsenal gradually crept about and strangled old Cole Fields, but while the houses stood they seemed to proclaim a semi-public right to the land surrounding. Tbe .big lake which stood on the site of the cartridge factory, and the marsh ditches which ran up to the road, were free to all who chose to climb the gate or creep through the ill-kept hedge in the skating season. The cottages were pulled down and tbe Arsenal wall completed all round the Government enclosure (about two and a half miles) in 1857. Smuggling. \u2014 Until the wall was built, and tbe police were intro duced, many contraband practices were in vogue, and the following par ticulars under the head of \" The Woolwich Smuggling \" were published in a morning paper, concerning one of the Government vessels employed in conveying stores : \u2014 1816. March 30th. \u2014 On the voyage home, a carpenter employed in securing the packages discovered the secret. Immediately on arrival he gave information at the Custom House, but it was ten days more before the ship was inspected ; in the meantime much of the smuggled goods for certain persons were got away, and only those were left for men of less note \u2014 there were to the value of \u00a37,000 for one man, packed up as \" return Congreve rockets.\" There were many rare things which were got out of the way. In the mortars were laces, gloves, cambrics, &c, and in the tumbrils were claret, champagne, &c. Many people have long suppUed themselves and friends with wine in this way, and their wives with finery. This is the only vessel which has been detected, but the trade has long and successfully been carried on to a great extent. The man who informed got about \u00a31 ,000. The Main Gate. \u2014 On the gates of the Royal Arsenal facing Beresford Square will be found displayed the letter ***\u25a0 B.\" This is in honour of Lord Beresford, by whom the new entrance was made in 1829, as the following inscription on the inner wall of the staircase under the bell turret will show : This Entrance to the Royal Arsenal was planned, and the Gateway constructed by order of General Viscount Beresford, G.C.B., G.C.H., Master-General of the Ordnance, in the tenth Year of the Reign of His Majesty King George IV. A.D. 1829. The former main gate was at the entrance to Rope Yard Rails, in"], [504, "350 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. the first pan^l of the wall, west of the police offices. One of the two blocked-up archways within the Arsenal will be found to correspond with this position. The Bell. \u2014 On Jan. 3, 1861, the bell at these gates, which was said to have done duty ever since the works began, became cracked. Its place was supplied hy a new one cast in tbe Gun Foundry, and this also cracked in tbe year 1886. The new bell was cast by a private firm, and hung in 1887, in which year a bell was also fixed at the Lower Plumstead Gate. Precautions. \u2014 In contrast with the want of caution exhibited in 1798 there appears to have been an excess of zeal in 1840, as the paragraph which follows will explain : \u2014 1840. October 14th. \u2014 It is pretty generally known that previous to the fires taking place in the dockyards, the public were suffered to enter the Royal Arsenal and go wherever their curiosity led them. Within the last few days, however, the various storehouses have been closed, and the pubUc are now merely allowed to walk along a portion of the roads which are under the immediate notice of the soldiers of the Royal Artillery. Upon entering the gates, the visitors are conducted into the lodge on the left, where a corporal of the Royal ArtUlery enters their names in a book, and after- wards proceeds with them to the officer's room in the guard-house, from whom he obtains a card, upon which are the foUowing instructions : \" Royal Arsenal, Wool- wich, Xo. 2. Permit this party to pass round the Arsenal. They are not to go into any building without asking the permission of the head of the department under whose charge it is. To prevent inconvenience to themselves, the parties are to keep the broad roads as dotted on the plan on the other side.\" Upon the reverse side of the card is an ink-line showing the route, and at each angle of the prescribed boun- dary an artillery -man is placed. The visitors are not permitted to go as far as the convict hulk, and cannot pass eastward of the foundry, boring mill, laboratory, store houses, or carriage department, all of which are closed agamst the pubUc. These extreme precautions appeared to be justified by some alarming occurrences, but they did not continue for many years.* The present system of almost unrestrained liberty to all visitors provided with cards from the War Office has been in unvaried operation for nearly forty years, into which period the whole life of the Royal Arsenal as it is known to this generation may be conveniently compressed. Watering Time. \u2014 -One last relic of old times and we will enter on the new era : \u2014 1829. \u2014 In this year the privilege of \" watering time \"was abolished. Hitherto half an hour in the morning and half an hour in the afternoon were allowed for refreshments in all departments of the Royal Arsenal, and beer was brought in by the potmen from the public-houses. * Vigilance was briefly renewed when the Camperdown exploded in the Thames on the 12th July, 1843.

CHAPTER XXXI THE MID-CENTURY IMPULSE AT THE ARSENAI Sir John Anderson. \u2014 One who had an early hand and a promi nent part in the reformation of the Royal Arsenal, during that momen tous crisis, the war with Russia in 1854-5, was Mr. (afterwards Dr. and Sir) John Anderson. By him was presented to Parliament, on the 8th of May, 1856, a \" General Statement of Past and Present Condition of the several Manufacturing Branches of the War Department,\" and of this I give the following slightly abbreviated version : \u2014 Up to 1842 the machinery in the Royal Gun Factory was almost as antiquated as the buUdings. The three great boring mills, moved by horses, which were imported in 1780, as modern, from the Hague, were the only engines used in making Her Majesty's ordnance untU fifteen years ago. The more modern departments, known as the Royal Carriage Factory and the Laboratory, have flourished during the present century in an unequal degree. For fifty years the former has been more or less in a high state of efficiency through the introduction of machinery from the workshops of Bramah and Maudslay and the contrivances of Bentham and Sir I. Brunei. The improvements due to theU genius rendered the department highly efficient during the French war, but it was not until 1847 that symptoms of renewed Use were manifested under the able superintendence of General Gordon, and still later of Colonel Colquhoun. The Laboratory during the same period appears to have remained quite stationary, and up to 1853 was far inferior to that of any third-rate z 2"], [508, "352 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Power. ... On the outbreak of the Russian war there were not shells enough in the Arsenal to furnish forth the first battering train that went to the East, and the fuzes were of the date of Waterloo. As the war proceeded the Ordnance were at their wits'-end for coarse-grained gunpowder. . . . We were obliged to go to Liege for 44,000 Minie guns, 3,000 cavalry swords, and 12,000 barrels of powder, and to the United States for 20,000 barrels more. Money no object. The want of machinery was the difficulty. The shells for the Baltic fleet alone, which had to be fabricated by private manufacturers, cost upwards of \u00a3100,000 more than they would have done had they been made by the new machinery lately introduced into the Royal Arsenal. The Government were charged by the contractors \u00a373 per ton for six-pounder diaphragm shells, now made in the Royal Laboratory for _\u00a314 19s. 2d. per ton. These demands and the rapid drain of stores led the War Department to consider whether it would not be better to organize a Government establishment on a larger Enfield Small Arms Factory. scale and better system. A very large number of ingenious machines were procured from America, and others were procured from the Continent and at home. In a very short time a powerful factory of munitions of war sprang into life. Within three years factories sprang up on either side. . . . Fourteen pieces of brass ordnance can now be turned out weekly, and the fine building recently erected * is intended for the manufacture of iron ordnance which has hitherto been produced exclusively by private manufacturers. Had we possessed reliable guns in the late campaign, the destruction of Cronstadt and Sevastopol would have only formed the work of a few days. No less than seventeen of the thirteen-inch mortars were destroyed by the want of tenacity in the iron. . . . The want of shells induced the authorities to permit Captain Boxer to erect a model factory of shells in the autumn of 1855. This he did with surprising rapidity. The success of the experiment led to the erection of the splendid shell foundry which is now attached to the Arsenal. But where is the Small Arms Factory >. When the War Office decided upon * The Armstrong (now Royal) Gun Factory."], [509, "PLATE XXXVIII. Gates of Shell Foundry. [To face page 352.]"], [510, ""], [511, "353 WOOLWICH. having such a factory, the Inspector of Machinery * wanted to plant it in the Royal Arsenal, but the authorities took it twelve miles down the Eastern Counties Railway to Enfield Lock, because they abeady had there a small establishment for making or mending a few muskets. Here, amid flocks and herds and pollard willows, we espy the tall chimneys of Enfield Factory, looking like a stray fragment of Manchester that has wandered out of its way. At Waltham Abbey, which is not half-an-hour's walk from Enfield Lock, is situ ated the Government powder manufactory. Here dispersion instead of concentration is the rule. The necessity for isolation causes the factories to he distributed over a very large space of ground, and the visitor has to walk from workshop to workshop through groves and avenues of willow and alder as though he were visiting dispersed farm buUdings. To such an extent do meadows and woods and canals abound that the idea of being in a powder-mill is entirely lost in the impression that you are in the midst of a Dutch landscape. The visitor is, however, somewhat startled at find ing a steam-engine at work, and a tall chimney smoking its pipe in the midst of the gunpowder works, but these are really many hundreds of feet from the mixing houses. Sir Frederick Ahel. \u2014 Another authority of our own time is Sir Frederick Abel. Tbe eminent chemist of the War Department, speak ing to the Foremen's Association in 1885, said that when he joined the Arsenal in 1849 \u2014 It consisted chiefly ol the Dial Square, in which the Dutch first cast the EngUsh guns (and Ui which the Dutch method was even then being carried on) with one or two smaU buildings on the site of the Carriage Department, having in their midst that wonderful old tool made by Bramah, which every one went to see. Farther on was a long tract of ground covered with guns, mostly old cannon and carronades, past service and condemned, but a marvellous sight for strangers to see. Shortly afterwards came the Russian war, and while they were arming the troops in the Crimea they built the Royal Arsenal \u2014 including the main factory of the Laboratory, the Cap Factory, the Shell Foundry and the Royal Gun Factory, or, as it was called, the Armstrong Factory. They not only cast their own guns, but imported machinery from America and elsewhere, and began to improve the style of their ordnance. The Small Arms Factory at Enfield was at the same time developed, and everybody was delighted with the progress those few years had made. Growth of the Arsenal. \u2014 Each of the manufacturing depart ments has continued and continues to grow. The Laboratory and Gun Factory, having secured a footing on the eastern outskirts, are pushing out new branches, the latter surrounding itself with additional forges and turneries, while the former has taken several flights and settled down, in isolated spots, its east laboratory or composition buildings, its boys' (formerly girls') cartridge factory, its cannon cartridge works, and more recently its torpedo factory. The Carriage Department, being restricted, has grown within itself, and been marvellously improved internally. Until 1848 a roadway occupied the site of the scrap forge, and divided the Carriage Square from the Engineer Square, but in that * The Inspector ot Machinery was John Anderson himself, and he was always desirous of having all the Government works under one head and located at Wool- wich."], [512, "354 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. year the erection of the forge united the two in one block, and soon afterwards the whole of the premises was given over to the department. A little later other open spots were roofed in to form workshops, the main road to the south being thus possessed in 1886-7, and within the last few years many of the partition walls have been removed, converting all the shops into one and forming the spacious factory which now exists. The separate building known as the mounting ground* and tbe departmental officest and drawing offices were erected about 1854, and the rest of the old shot ground which stood in front of the shell foundry was taken in for other buildings in 18S5. The splendid model room in the south side of \" the Square \" was built about the same time as tbe aforesaid offices. Tbe old saw-mill, part of which remains, has stood since 1812. The new buildings have banished beyond the canal most of the old guns which formerly were a feature of the Arsenal, and the piles of spherical shot have almost disappeared. In 1850 it was reported that there were in the Royal Arsenal twenty-four thousand pieces of ordnance, three thousand being of gun metal, and twenty-one thousand of iron. Tbe weight of the largest gun cast at that time was. as in 1837, ninety hundredweight. The Armstrong Gun Factory. \u2014 When the Royal Gun Factories were built, in 1854-5 for the manufacture of the wrought- iron ordnance invented by Mr. (now Sir William) Armstrong, he was appointed Superintendent of the works. The tower which stands beside the bisecting road supported one side of a fine brick arch, since removed, and was intended for a clock tower. The clock is said to have been manufactured in London and to have had four faces, each nine feet in diameter, with hands respectively four and six feet long. But it was never put into its intended place, and tbe tower is useless except as an illustration of frustrated aims. Improved Guns. \u2014 The introduction of rifled cannon dates from 1860. On January 4th of that year the first rifled guns were turned out at the Rifled Ordnance Factory, and on November 7th following the first heavy Armstrong (100 pdr.) breechloader was proved at tbe Royal Arsenal. * The large shed which covered the mounting ground was destroyed in a snow- storm at Christmas, 1886, and was rebuilt of stronger materials. It was handed over to the inspection branch at the reorganization in 1888. t In \"Recollections of Woolwich,\" an unpretending work pubUshed by Mr. R. E. White in 1885, it is stated that the Carriage Department Office was formerly in the building now occupied by the Inspector of Machinery at the Rookery, and subse- quently in the Engineer Office, now devoted to the Volunteers ; the. Gun Factory Office was at the corner of the brass foundry, now the Audit Office ; and the Laboratory Office was in the Laboratory Square.^"], [513, "355 WOOLWICH. War with Russia. \u2014 The time of the great Russian war was a time of marvellous changes at Woolwich, and during its height ten thousand men and boys were employed in the Royal Arsenal, a number exceeded only by very recent years and under extraordinary circumstances. The most rapid advance that the Arsenal has ever experienced was developed during the continuance of this campaign. Inventors. \u2014 The whole nation was affected by the war fever, and projectors of all kinds (clergymen included) devoted their energies to the invention of new implements of destruction. Close upon two thousand suggested improvements in artillery were examined by the Ordnance Select Committee in 1854-5. Some proposed to fill shells with cayenne pepper, chloroform and cacodyle, a most virulent con trivance for poisoning the air. Only thirty of all these proposals were ever adopted, one of which was a plan of filling shells with liquid iron, which, in the first experiment, destroyed the new butt which had just been erected below the canal at a cost of \u00a3200. Another was the great Mallet mortar, hooped like a barrel, which threw a shell of three feet diameter, and containing 200 lbs. of powder. When fired in the marshes the shells descended with such force that some of them could not be found by digging and probing twenty-five feet deep, and the artillerymen surmised that they had gone to Australia ! But the mortar proved incapable of sustaining the moderate charge of 75 lbs. of powder, and it stands in the Arsenal now, a conspicuous monument of courageous but misdirected enterprise. Mr. Francis Pellatt, \u2014 While the war lasted and all the manufac- turing departments were undergoing a process, practically, of recon struction, the Ordnance (or Storekeeper's) department was on its first important trial. Mr. Francis Pellatt, a gentleman of great ability and a most popular official, was selected by Lord Palmerston at this juncture to direct the department, which he did, under trying difficulties, with remarkable success. Mr. Pellatt bad entered the department when a lad, and his life was one of constant advancement, during which he was always known as the workman's friend, but was nevertheless a most diligent and faithful servant of the Crown. In early life he was em ployed abroad, and was next attached to the Carriage Department, in which, on the retirement of Mr. Grinton, he became chief clerk, and then storekeeper. The Crimean war gave his powers of administration full play, and he was at the height of bis prosperity when an unfortunate accident cut short his career and plunged the whole community into sorrow and mourning. On Monday, May 31st, 1858, he was driving a cob-pbaeton down New Road, having Mrs. Pellatt with him, when a puff of steam from the railway frightened the animal, which bolted, and, in turning the corner of Plumstead Road, upset the carriage."], [514, "356 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Mr. Pellatt sustained such injuries that, after remaining in Dr. Cole man's surgery for two days, he died unconscious, at the age of forty seven years. His wife was also seriously hurt, but recovered. The deceased gentleman held the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, and was buried with military honours in Plumstead Churchyard, the Arsenal workpeople attending en masse to mourn their \" friend.\" Later Days. \u2014 The later records of the Royal Arsenal deal chiefly with the visits of distinguished personages, productions more or less. remarkable of warlike goods, and some lamentable misadventures. Queen Victoria. \u2014 Of Royal visits we have only two occasions to mention in which Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria has honoured Woolwich since the sad death of the Prince Consort, and on both these occasions Her Majesty merely passed through on her way to the Continent. Neither was consequently a public event, and would not call for particular mention but for an absurd feature of the second visit which has become historical. A Case of Over-zeal. \u2014 The earlier of these two embarkations took place at tbe Dockyard, and certain officials fell into disgrace for admit ting a visitor or two after an order had been issued that the Queen wished for strict privacy. Warned probably by this example, the officer who was at the head of tbe Royal Arsenal resolved when he received a similar order to obey it to the letter, and in the end got snubbed for his excessive pains. The Queen's departure took place from the T-pier of tbe Arsenal on tbe afternoon of Tuesday, August 11th, 1864, and this time the privacy was quite painful. The report before us says that the roads all the way from London were crowded with people, that police constables were placed at intervals along the whole distance, and that two mounted patrols, \" wearing the new helmet which is to be adopted as tbe head-dress of all the Metropolitan police,\" rode in front, tbe only semblance of authority. The carriage was closed, but Her Majesty bowed from the windows in response to the respectful salutations of her people. Tbe Arsenal was as silent as a cemetery. Except the police and the soldiers on guard not a living soul was to be seen. The clerks and workmen had been forbidden under fearful penalties even to look out of or approach the windows, and all the workmen were withdrawn from the wharves hours before. The families residing in the Arsenal were enjoined to keep indoors, and four or five officials on tbe pier were all the persons Her Majesty saw till she got on board her yacht. It was afterwards stated that the Queen was much displeased when she came to hear of all this fuss, Her Majesty's only desire having been to avoid unnecessary ceremony and a multitude of people."], [515, ""], [516, "PLATE XXXIX. The Thunderer Gun Experiments. [To face page 357.]"], [517, "357 WOOLWICH. The Girls' Factory. \u2014 Since the Crimean war, the Royal Arsenal has seen some fluctuations, but few, if important, changes. Among the latter is the discontinuance of female labour. In one of the large workshops beyond the canal \u2014 then known as the Girls' Factory, but now tbe Cartridge Factory, and filled with boys \u2014 several hundred girls were employed for a series of years making cartridges, under Mrs. Mabbett, as shown in the sketch at the head of this chapter. In March, 1872, they were all dismissed, and no girls have since been employed. Recent events are a little out of place in this historical chapter, and I bave no intention of following them. Tbe most momentous are those which have originated in the public inquiries, due to certain charges made, in 1886, under the name of \" the Ordnance Scandals,\" which, though they proved utterly untrue, have led to the reorganization of the departments on an improved foundation, as will be presently shown. The \" Thunderer\" Gun Trials. \u2014 Even the experiments which are on the \" Records \" would require several volumes for their proper narration, and must therefore be passed by, but I may make an exception of the Thunderer gun incident, because of the interest which it excited, and the important bearing which it had upon tbe reputation and prosperity ofthe Royal Arsenal. In 1878-9 breech-loading slowly began to supersede the Woolwich muzzle-loading system, and the advocates of rival patterns began the crusade of criticisms which lasted for years after. Just at this crisis, on January 2nd, 1879, one of the two 38-ton muzzle-loaders on board of H.M.S. Thunderer burst during practice in the Mediterranean, and an avalanche of censures descended upon tbe heads of the War Office and its advisers. The officials denied that the explosion was due to any fault of the gun, and at once declared that it must have heen caused by double loading. A long inquiry took place, followed by many experiments, in which all sorts of attempts were made to burst the sister gun, which was brought home to Woolwich from the Thunderer, until at length, on February 3rd, 1880, the gun was double loaded, and burst almost precisely as the other had burst thirteen months before. Tbe experiments took place in a bomb proof cell, specially constructed, opposite the proof-butts at the Royal Arsenal. New Berber. \u2014 In 1886, the railway plant which was purchased for the proposed desert-line from Suakim to Berber, together with the water-pipes which were to have been laid over the same tract of sand, and a variety of other stores from Egypt, were deposited upon a large area of tbe marsh-land, enclosed within a fence, and forthwith named \" New Berber.\""], [518, "358 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Powder Magazines. \u2014 'Berber\" was handed over to the charge of the Royal Arsenal police, and soon afterwards the magazines in the marshes were also transferred from military to police custody. This change was brought about, mainly by the panics to which young sentries had given wa}- at their lonely posts, in one of which a private belonging to the Welsh Regiment of Infantry had killed a comrade with a bayonet, mistaking him in the darkness for a dynamitard, while guarding the Gun Cotton Magazine at the end of the Harrow Manor way. The police station on the Magazine premises was occupied and the sentries withdrawn on November 24th, 1886."], [519, "Convict Hulk off' Warren Lane. CHAPTER XXXII. THE CONVICT PERIOD. Punishment by Contract. \u2014 *Of all the changes which have happened to Woolwich the one attended with the greatest blessing was the abolition of the convict establishment from the Royal Arsenal. Convict hulks were established by Act of Parliament in 1776, prior to which, felons under long sentence were all punished by transportation. Eighty years of Woolwich history, prior to 1856, is thus strongly flavoured with incidents and adventures connected with the criminals here imprisoned on board the ships in the river. These vessels, called \"the hulks,\" were moored off tbe Dockyard and Arsenal, and were originally farmed by a contractor ; Mr. Duncan Campbell, who was a well-known man of his time, undertaking their maintenance and safe custody for a consideration which the Government readily conceded, in order to be rid of the trouble. * So long, however, as the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, the hulks have been strictly national institutions under Government management, and, so far as we remember them, were named the Warrior, the Justitia, and the Defence. The Justitia, the accompanying sketch of which was made in 1849, lay nearly opposite Warren Lane, having the hospital ship in a line up river. * In a pamphlet published in 1782, entitled \" Hints for the Regulation of the Convicts in the Hulks off Woolwich and other Places,\" it is stated that the first contract when the hulks were provided was at the rate of ,\u00a332 for each convict per annum, and that it was afterwards reduced to \u00a326."], [520, "360 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Convict Labour. \u2014 The original purpose of the convicts being brought to Woolwich was the utilisation of their labour in the ex tension works at the Dockyard and Arsenal, and they were for many years so employed. The contractor appears to bave done the work very well until, for economy's sake, a Government was found bold enough to take it in hand. When the extension works were finished, tbe convicts were put to work as labourers in the Yard and Arsenal, but this proved unsatisfactory in many ways, and at length, in 1856, they were all taken away to Chatham and other places, where there was work to do of more appropriate kind. The digging and removal of earth is always found the most suitable labour for convicts, and while they were at Woolwich, gangs of the prisoners were occasionally employed on such jobs outside the walls of the Government works, as, for instance, in 1848, when they excavated tbe circular reservoir at the summit of Woolwich Common. Inhabitants of that date may remember them shuffling along New Road, to and from their work, all tethered to a single chain. The hulks were removed from the Dockyard some years before they disappeared from the Arsenal, which bad long been their headquarters. The Hulks. \u2014 A report upon the subject was published, July 15th, 1776, in one of the magazines, the hulks having at that time been just established. The writer says : \u2014 The law for sentencing the convicts to work upon the Thames is indeed severe, but we trust it will be salutary. They are to be employed in as much labour as they can sustain, to be fed with legs and shins of beef, ox cheek, and such other coarse food ; to have nothing for drink but water or small beer ; to be clad in some squalid uniform ; never to be visited without the consent of the overseers ; and whoever gives them the smallest relief incurs a penalty of forty shillings. The expense of keeping and maintaining them is to be paid by Government, and not out of the county rates. The first vessel launched for the above purpose was constructed on a plan approved of by his Majesty in council. It cannot be called a ship or tender, neither is it so flat or open as a lighter ; it is calculated to hold twenty-seven tons of baUast. On the larboard side the gunwale is considerably broader than in the common lighters ; on the starboard side is a flooring about three feet broad, for the men to work on, and a machine' called a da vid,* with a windlass, for raising the baUast. Part of the vessel is decked in abaft, for the convicts to sleep in, and another in the forecastle is formed into a kind of cabin for the overseer. Her outward appearance differs very little from that of a common lighter. t On the 5th of August, the convicts, chained by the leg, two and two, began to work in her, about two miles below Barking Creek, under the direction of Duncan Campbell, Esq., who has been appointed the governor of this new kind of Bridewell. Their behaviour, in general, since they came on board her, and other lighters employed in the same service, has been very becoming ; the clause in the Act which says that the time for which they * Vernacular, \"davit.\" + This description applies, not to the hulks, which were simply the hulls of old war-ships, but to the barges employed for dredging."], [521, ""], [522, "[To face page 361.] Convicts constructing Embankment of tlie Warren, 1779.

A few of them, indeed, employed a little below Woolwich, attempted to get off theU chains, and were guilty of some slight outrages to their commander, when a severe flagellation ensued on their being again properly secured. Eight others, a short time after, found means to seize on the arm-chest ; and presenting pistols to the heads of their keepers, threatened to blow theU brains out if they did not immediately go down into the hold, which they were obliged to comply with ; upon which the viUains jumped into a boat which had been designedly brought alongside by some of their friends, and got clear off. The writer of \" The Water Companion,\" in 1802, reports that \u2014 At the entrance to Woolwich Reach from E. by S., we see two or three old ships wherein are kept near three hundred felons,* here punished by working in lighters to clear the sandbanks in the Thames and on shore in the Warren or Gun Park. Here also the matrosses are employed in the composition of fireworks and cartridges, and in extracting salt-petre from damaged gunpowder. Convict News. \u2014 The following are newspaper cuttings relating to this subject :- \u2014 \u25a0 1777. The heads of the oxen slaughtered on Tower Hill are daily sent down to Woolwich hulks for the convicts. 1777. April 23rd. \u2014 One day last week the ballast tighter working on the Essex coast was drove over the river to Woolwich by the high wind, when fourteen of the convicts rose upon their keepers, cut one of them terribly in the shoulder and made their escape. A naval officer, meeting them at Greenwich, persuaded eight to return to their duty, but the other six have not since been heard of. 1777. December 1. \u2014 Last week one of the convicts at Woolwich, being at work on shore, concealed himself amongst some rushes, and in the night got in at the chamber window of a gardener in that town, and stole some plate, wearing apparel, and other things : but the gardener's wife, hearing him, alarmed her husband, who pursued and took him. He was carried on board the ballast lighter and severely flogged. 1780. \u2014 The convicts at Woolwich are now employed in making a new wharf at the Warren, opposite to where the hulks lay, for the purpose of the Ordnance hoys load ing and unloading, which they at present are obliged to do above the Warren, a practice attended with great inconvenience. Building the Arsenal Wharf. \u2014 This scene is illustrated in the picture on the opposite page, which is copied on a small scale from a large and rare engraving published in 1779. The original is inscribed as follows : \u2014 A view of the Hulks at Woolwich, with some of the convicts heaving up ballast and others on shore wheeling it to the places where the embankments are made by them.

They were well clad, and, by theU appearance, seemed well fed ; but, in general, the sense of shame was lost. If they had any at first, it soon is changed into hardened impudence, by the depravity of their fellow prisoners. At this time there were about three hundred busied on land, besides others who are employed on the shoals of the river in the ballast Ughters. At night they are all lodged on board four great hulks. Notable Escapes. \u2014 A little of the nervousness with which the inhabitants were wont to regard their unpleasant neighbours may be reasonably excused, for, if we do not hear of any serious crimes com mitted by the felons, they provided occasional excitements of severe impressiveness. In the Annual Register, under date of Thursday, June 27th, 1805, it is thus recorded : \u2014 This day five of the convicts on board the hulks at Woolwich endeavoured to make theU escape in a boat. They were pursued, and not surrendering, were fired at. Two were shot dead, and another was so much wounded that he soon cUed. The other two were taken unhurt. Similar attempts were frequent, a few successes, but mostly failures. The following are reports taken from old newspapers : \u2014 1832. November. \u2014 On Saturday, as a gang of twenty-four convicts employed in the Arsenal were going to work, twelve of the number attempted to escape, by jumping over a very high hedge, which divides the marshes from the high road. The sentinel immediately fired, bringing back eight of the number, the other four continuing their flight towards Plumstead Common. The artiUery on duty in the Arsenal, accom- panied by a number of villagers, went in pursuit, and found two of the fugitives con- cealed in a quickset hedge in a secluded spot* behind the niiti on Plumstead Common. They had taken off their shirts and pulled them over theU jackets, and pulled theti- stockings over the irons on their legs. The other two were found behind a haystack between Wickham and Welling. 1837. May 8th. \u2014 On Saturday afternoon a party of convicts, employed in Wool- wich Dockyard in charge of an officer and mUitary sentinel, four most determined characters, named Boutel, Wallace, Dalton, and Bannon, suddenly rushed upon the sentinel, a rifleman, on duty at the west gate, and forcibly took away his rifle. On one of the officers approaching, Boutel, who had the rifle, swore to blow his brains out, and all four made their escape by scaling the gate. On breaking into the London Road, the convicts betook themselves to the brickfields on the other side. Their ignorance of the localities induced them to climb a steep hiU on the centre of Charlton sandpits, thinking it was part of the hanging wood, but, finding a ravine of great depth intervened between them and the only spot by which they could expect to escape, they rapidly descended in fuU view of the excavators into the pits. Boutel. abandoning the rifle to Bannon, heavUy chained as he was, and compelled to employ- one hand in holding up his fetters, squatted down, and folding his arms over his knees, rolled himself, bounding like a ball, down a steep precipice fuU eighty feet deep, without sustaining any injury. Dalton took a line up the face of the ascent to the hanging wood ; the others passed through an orchard and some gardens, greatly alarming the inhabitants of that rural and retired spot, Woodland Place, who shut themselves in and watched the chase, as the yagers followed, discharging several shots without effect. Captain Grove, observing that the convicts were taking different dUections, extended his men, and in this way WaUace was captured. The others gained the summit of the hill, crossed a bridle road, and struck into a close shaw of"], [525, "363 WOOLWICH. underwood and furze, and when the troops attained the summit, the convicts were not to be seen. A tinker in the bridle road refused .to give any tidings of them, but intelligence was obtained from two boys, and the bugle sounded to encompass this part of the wood. If they had been a hundred instead of three, they must all have been captured in the lessening circle, and the villains were dragged from their lurking places, the rifle-piece recovered, and they were marched back to Woolwich. On board the hulks they were severely flogged. In October, 1833, a remonstrance was made to Lord Melbourne on tbe subject of the transmission of convicts by the stage coaches which ran between London and Woolwich, and subsequently the prisoners were brought down in special conveyances, generally by water. Prison Fever. \u2014 The health of the convict establishment was generally bad, due no doubt to overcrowding, the proximity of the marshes, and the harsh conditions of prison life. For some j*ears prior to 1840 there was a frequent outbreak of fever, and as an inquest bad to be held on every prisoner who died, the public was much scandalized by the excessive mortality among the miserable creatures. Strange Verdict. \u2014 On the 29th of December, 1840, an inquest was held at tbe Salutation, Woolwich, on the bodies of no fewer than seven convicts, but the jury returned the strange verdict of \" Died by the visitation of God of fever.\" Old Woolwich juries seemed to have found this form of verdict convenient in all cases of difficulty. Even when a soldier was flogged to death, the authorities were relieved of their responsibility by the jury's declaration that death resulted, not from the lashes, but from \" The visitation of God.\" The fees which were then allowed to coroners' juries may have helped to make them complacent, but could scarcely have enhanced their sense of a solemn duty. A Queer Joke. \u2014 For example, we find in tbe police court deposi tions tbe following case : \u2014 1831. January 2nd. \u2014 John Lowe, a butcher, was charged with administering a drug to a jury at the Chatham Arms. After an inquest on three convicts who died at the hulks, the jury received the county allowance of twenty shilUngs and ordered eight pounds of beef steaks, and each had a glass of grog. John Lowe was journeyman to Mr. Campion, butcher. It was proved that he bought twopenny worth of tartaric acid and that he was about the kitchen when the steak was cooked. All the jurymen were immediately and simultaneously ill, and the prisoner was arrested and kept for a time in custody on suspicion, but the worst supposition was that he had played a daring and dangerous practical joke, and, as the victims recovered, he was released. At this time the convicts were employed both in the Dockyard and Arsenal, and a paragraph of October 10th, 1835, says : \u2014 The convicts in the Arsenal are employed beating the rust off the shot and shells."], [526, "364 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Disasters. \u2014 During the later part of their stay here, when they did the work of ordinary labourers in the workshops both at the Arsenal and the Dockyard, I have some horrible recollections of inquests at both places on unlucky convicts, whose bodies were accidentally severed in twain by the circular saw. While they were stationed at the Dockyard, the following midnight incident occurred : \u2014 1839. 21s* March. \u2014 About half-past 12 a.m. on Monday, an alarm was given in Woolwich Dockyard that the \" Ganymede \" convict ship, with about three hundred men battened under hatches, had capsized. The mud and water were fast filling the cabins when means of egress were found, and the convicts, who behaved well, were got out drenched to the skin. The vessel had faUen on her bilge through part of her moorings having given way. Exodus. \u2014 Since our convict establishments were broken up at Woolwich, and prisoners under sentence more usefully employed upon the works at Chatham, and Dover, and elsewhere, Woolwich has been more happily and profitably served by free labour."], [527, "CHAPTER XXXIII. THE ORDNANCE DEPARTMENTS. The Sister Works. \u2014 The Royal Arsenal having become virtually tbe emporium of all the warlike arts, and its name the generic term for all the factories of arms and ammunition, I may introduce its satellites. Associated under one chief, and closely connected in many ways, the Royal Arsenal and the establishments at Enfield and Waltham Abbey are more than sisters \u2014 they are practically consolidated as the separate branches of one concern in the production of the national munitions, and would have been, but for reasons of policy, all combined at Wool wich. Like the Arsenal, they owe their development to the war with Russia. Enfield Small- Arms Factory. \u2014 It was in 1854 that the Govern ment decided, on the recommendation of a committee, to establish a manufactory of small arms to a limited extent, under the direction of the Board of Ordnance, and the House of Commons voted \u00a3150,000 for the experiment. Prior to that time, all our rifles were manufactured by private firms, chiefly at Birmingham, but in times of emergency we had often to seek aid from foreigners. It is true that a small Govern ment factory had existed at Enfield Lock since the early part of the cen tury, and that every year a few thousand muskets were there turned out by hand, but, as we have seen by the report of Sir John Anderson, there was at one time an idea of absorbing the Enfield works in the Royal Arsenal, and establishing the national small-arms factory as one of its departments. Other counsels, however, prevailed, and on a narrow strip of land hemmed round by the little river Lea, the Royal Small-arms Factory was built in 1855-6. Since then, other workshops have been added ; and the land enclosed, including the practice butt, covers forty acres. At first the factory was under the supervision of Mr. Parkins, the manager, but from 1872 it has bad, like the other factories, a military super intendent. The average annual output is about 60,000 rifles, 5,000 pistols, and 8,000 swords or bayonets ; but the resources are such that the rate of production could easily be advanced to 150,000 stand of arms.

As a Government establishment they are only of recent importance, but a powder factory has existed on the spot since 1684. The stream h ere separates into several canals and sidings, making in all ten miles of water, and the whole area forms a miniature Venice or Amsterdam. On its many islands and promontories the various sheds and works are disposed at discreet distances apart, surrounded and divided by thick groves of alder, willow and dogwood trees, the timber of which makes good charcoal for explosive uses.

The Impulse of 1885.- \u2014 In 1885 the Royal Arsenal received thc most healthy and enduring of its many impulses, consequent on the sudden discovery that the national defences were not in the state which befitted a great maritime power, and a determination to put the navy and the coaling stations into a condition of permanent efficiency. This necessitated not only a considerable augmentation of strength in the Royal Arsenal, but also the employment of night-workers, or \" shifts,\" and a general resort to overtime for more than twelve months at a stretch. Envy and Enmity. \u2014 The consequent prosperity of Woolwich at a time when trade generally throughout the country was depressed speedily attracted covetous eyes towards the Royal Arsenal, and the representatives of various interests were not slow in Parliament and elsewhere to fall foul of the Ordnance Departments on all sorts of pre tences. Protests were made against the overtime system, which was said to prevent the fair distribution of labour, and in 1886, the Secretary of State for War yielded to remonstrances, and ordered that overtime should cease. The following statement, which is, like all the figures which follow, official, will show the extent to which night work and overtime had been resorted to in the three manufacturing depart ments. 12 Between 1848 and 1850 there were several medical officers who took duty in the Royal Arsenal for short and broken periods. 13 Previously Assistants."], [535, "371 WOOLWICH. Accusations and Inquisitions. \u2014 A natural effect of the accusa tions made in Parliament and the Press was to create a feeling of uneasiness and distrust throughout the country, and at length certain charges were formulated, and a series of inquiries were instituted. The chief of these was the work of a Parliamentary Committee appointed to inquire into the organization and administration of the manufacturing departments, and the Committee was under the presidency of the Earl of Morley. Their investigations were long and searching, and in the end, they reported that the charges which had been preferred were false, but they recommended certain changes in organization and administration, amongst which was the appointment, as before mentioned, of a supreme head. Eardley Maitland. \u2014 The choice of the Queen's advisers fell upon Colonel Eardley Maitland, C.B., Royal Artillery, who, with the title of Director- General of Ordnance Factories, and the rank of Major-General, took up his appointment on November 1st, 1887. His command embraces all the manufacturing establishments at Woolwich, Enfield, Waltham Abbey, Birmingham, &c, and he is directly under the authority of the Secretary of State for War, the office of Surveyor of Ordnance being abolished, and the Director of Artillery transferred to the military side of the War Establish ment.

Consolidation. \u2014 Although the consolidation of the whole of the departments under the one head commenced in November, 1887, it did not fully take effect until the beginning of the following financial year, April 1st, 1888. The whole of the superintendents of departments at Woolwich, Enfield, Waltham Abbey, and Birmingham, with the clerks and managers, office keepers, messengers, electricians, railway men, &c, were then included in the Director-General's staff, and the whole of the Works Department, medical establishment, and other isolated institutions, were also attached to, and absorbed by, his office. The sum of \u00a33,000 was v.oted by Parliament in 1888 to provide the building in which the work of the Director- General is carried on. Inspection. \u2014 A separate inspection of stores, whether supplied by the Ordnance Factories or by contractors, was instituted on March 1st, 1888, in accordance with the recommendation of Lord Morley 's Com mittee of 1887. Its establishment as approved consisted of one chief inspector for small arms at \u00a3800, twelve inspectors at from \u00a3455 to \u00a3582 for guns, carriages, ammunition, &c, and five inspectors at \u00a3250 to \u00a3300 for harness, saddlery, and other stores. There is also an inspector for machinery at \u00a3600, and the chemical and photographic establishment, being essentially an inspection department, was trans ferred entirely to the new office. The inspectors and proof officers at Woolwich (under Col. C. Morlev, H.A., Assistant-Director of Artillery) are : \u2014 Laboratory Stores : Inspector, Captain C. F. Hadden, R.A. ; Assistant -Inspectors, Lieutenant A. H. W. Dod, R.A., and Lieutenant H. C. W. Eteson, R.A. * Including Dockyard, where are about 500 workmen and 25 police. t Approximate.

The first King who lifM Courl ai Eltham is said to have been King Henry III, who visited Eltham for the Christmas Festivities of 1270. Edward I (1272 1,07) signed several Charters at Eltham. During his reign Antony Bek, Bishop ol Durham, came into temporary possession ol the Palace. The Bishop rebuilt the Palace. 1"], [8, "Photo: Francis The Great Hall from the Lawn Edward II and Isabella, his Queen, frequently dwelt here. Their son, John of Eltham, was born here. Edward III (1327-1377) freo^iently dwelt at Eltham. It was during his reign, perhaps, that the royal village witnessed the most brilliant spectacles of pageantry and chivalry in all its history. In Edward's reign the \"Order of the Garter\" was finally established at Eltham. In 1347 a great tournament took place at Eltham, when Edward had returned from his victories in France. In 1356, after the Battle of Poitiers, King John of France was brought as a prisoner to Eltham. Froissart, the famous Chronicler, has left a full description of the rejoicings at Eltham Palace on this occasion. \"I can 2"], [9, "3 Photo : Francis The North Entran ce never relate how very honourably and majestically the King and Queen of England received King John,\" writes Froissart. Richard II frequently at Eltham. He held several Parliaments here, and much important business of State was transacted at Eltham Palace during his reign. In 1385 Eltham was honoured by the visit of Leo, King of Armenia. Henry IV frequently at Eltham. He kept Christmas here on five occasions, namely, in 1400, 1404, 1406, 1409, and 141 2. It was on the occasion of his Christmas festivities in 1400 that he entertained at the Palace, Manuel Pal\u00e6ologos, the Emperor of Constantinople."], [10, "4 In 141 2 Henry IV spent his last Christmas here, under sad circumstances. He suffered from leprosy. \"So complete was his seclusion, owing both to his illness and the awful disfigurement of his person, that he scarcely saw anyone but the queen, lying frequently for hours without any signs of life. After Candlemas he was so much better as to be able to keep his birthday ; so he was carried from Eltham to his palace at Westminster, where he had summoned the Parliament.\" Henry V kept his first Christmas as King at Eltham, in 141 3, and on that occasion a circumstance came to light which made it necessary for the king to cut his Eltham visit short, and hasten away to the Palace at Westminster, and thence to Windsor.

In 1416 Sigismund, King of the Romans, and Emperor Elect of Germany, paid a visit to Henry at Eltham. Its object was to secure the aid of Henry in a great scheme for putting an end to the divisions in the Church of Rome. There were, at the time, no less than three Popes, all declaring to have been lawfully elected. Henry VI (1422-1461) spent the early part of his life at Eltham Palace, and after a troublous reign, during which he was dethroned, we gather from the b"], [12, "6 The South Door \"Privy Council\" records that the unhappy King was allowed to come out to Eltham and amuse himself by hunting in the royal woods. His reflections must have been sad ones when he thought of the troubled times lie had passed through since those happy days, forty years before, when he played in these familiar fields, and since that other time, fifteen years before, when he brought his bride to the Palace at Eltham, full of hope for a happy and prosperous reign. Edward IV (1461-1483) resided very frequently at Eltham, greatly improved the Palace, built the new bridge over the Moat, rebuilt the Banqueting Hall. It is recorded that at his festivities as many as 2.000 persons were feasted daily at his tables"], [13, "7 View from Moat Wall Henry VII 1 1485-1509) spent much time at Eltham and helped to beautify thc Palace. During his reign, in 1500, the philosopher Erasmus visited the Palace in the company of Sir Thomas More, where they met the children of Henry VII, namely, Prince Flenry, afterwards Henry \\ III, Lady Margaret, afterw*ards Queen cf Scotland, Lady Mary, and Prince Edmund. The incident was subsequently recorded in one of the letters of Erasmus. Henry VIII (1 509-1 547) spent much of his childhood at Eltham Palace, and when King he came frequently to reside here, in the early part of his reign. Christmas in 15 15 seems to have been a remarkable one. It was on Christmas Eve, in the Palace Chapel, that Cardinal Wolsey, who"], [14, "had risen to great eminence, took the oaths of Lord Chancellor, and was created to that office in suc- cession to Archbishop Warham, who delivered the Great Seal on the 22nd December, only two days before. Henry VIII practically forsook Eltham as a Royal residence, when the Palace at Greenwich was completed. Queen Elizabeth (1 558-1603) lived here as a hild, and occasionally visited when Queen. James I (1603-1625) paid short visits, mainly for hunting in the Park. Charles I (1625-1649) made occasional visits. During the Commonwealth the Palace ceased to exist, the beautiful chapel and the greater part of the Palace itself were pulled down by Colonel Rich. The Great Hall was left and used for agricultural purposes [r. R. C. GREGORY.] Photo : Francis The Great Hall, showing South Bay s"], [15, "THE RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. VOL.

The compilation of these Records has occupied the leisure of twelve years, and every endeavour has been used to ensure their accuracy, but it is only to be expected that as the book proceeds errors and imperfections will appear. In all such instances early corrections or additions will be grate- fully welcomed, and provision may then be made for rectifying faults during publication, so as to present the completed Records purified as far as possible from all defects and insufficiencies. In the meantime the Author pleads for an indulgent criticism and a kindly interest in his endeavour to supply a fuller and more accurate history than yet exists of the locality to which he and so many friends and neighbours have devoted their lives. In this he is already assured of much sympathy, and but for the assistance which he has received on all sides his efforts would have been of little worth. His greatest hope at the outset of his enterprise is, that the work may incite in many minds a thoughtful and intelligent disposition to observe, study, and reflect upon the world at our doors, and gather from these Records a warmer reg rd for the surrounding scenes and the people amongst whom we dwell.

(The Original Engraving reproduced hy photography.) INTRODUCTION. A SEALED PACKET. I was bent upon a day's pleasure. With something of an angler's zest I had devoted the whole of a spare day to a good hard fishing among the records. There is a great resemblance between this kind of sport and the sport of the rod and line ; and when, with no impediment pre vailing, I start on such expeditions, I think I know how Piscator feels when bound for his favourite stream. Many pleasant days, spread over several years, had been already spent in that charming haunt, thc Library ofthe British Museum ; but to-day I was to try my fortune in new pre serves. I had heard some time long ago of a sealed packet, vaguely sup posed to hold many secrets of Woolwich, somewhere hidden away, no one knew where. I had an indistinct idea that the abode of this treasure was either the United Service Institution, the Indian Museum at South Kensington, or Sir John Soane's mansion of curiosities in Lincoln's Inn Square, whose locked chambers are still to some extent concealed from mortal eye. To these I severally repaired, and in each was courteously assisted by the officials in my search. Old lumber that had scarcely seen daylight for years was dragged out and examined, books, models, and plans and drawings of all kinds were displayed, but nothing like a"], [74, "2 INTRODUCTION. revelation appeared to view. Remembering that I had publicly adver tised this, my strong desire, on more than one occasion, and had utterly failed in its achievement, I began to despair of success, and resolved to give up the search as idle and visionary. At least I would spend the remainder of the day in the soothing atmosphere of the ever blissful British Museum. Arriving at Bloomsbury, I was fatigued with the long morning's work, and as I passed the well-known portal I certainly never dreamed of that day netting a prize. The broad shelves with their thousands of works of reference had ali been travelled over many a time and oft, and all the promising volumes probed and robbed as the bee robbeth the flowers. I suppose that the veriest tyro of the reading-room knows that the accessible shelves are only the beginning of research. But I had also thoroughly scoured the catalogues \u2014 especially lhe Catalogue, which itself consists of 2,000 great volumes ; and every work which seemed to bear upon the affairs of my district, or to have any connection therewith, had been duly requisitioned and studied, until I had read or referred to thousands of books and made a pretty pile of notes. Even accustomed readers, however, are slow in understanding the catalogues, and especially in penetrating far beyond the general cata- logue, where are a number of special catalogues in which are enumerated works of particular classes, not mentioned, though they ought to be, in the general catalogue. It requires a long apprenticeship to the Library to become familiar with all these sources of information, and were it not for the invariable courtesy and help of the gentlemanly officials, the poor student would often come to grief. I had previously marked down one of these special catalogues for attack, and found that it dealt exclusively with plans and diagrams in the King's Library. To-day I got it out and turned over the index pages as usual. \" Wool- wich,\" \"Plumstead,\" \"Charlton,\" \"Erith,\" \"Lesnes,\" \"Kent,\" \"Thames,\" &c, were looked for without any particular success, and then I came almost by chance upon \" Dockyards of England \u2014 South-east District.\" This looked promising, and I sent for the work. It arrived, a ponderous tome two feet square, which when opened nearly covered the ample desk allotted to the reader. Yes. Here were certainly some fish which seemed worth catch ing. But what is this ? \" Plans of Woolwich Dockyard, &c, not to be opened.\" A great packet, sealed up, how long nobody knew, and not to be opened ! The book came, as I have said, out of the King's Library, that vast and splendid treasury of books accumulated by George III. and presented to the nation by bis son George IV. Thither I went, and was informed that the plans were more than"], [75, "3 INTRODUCTION. a hundred years old, and that they had beeii sealed up for an indefi nite period, like many others of the same kind, as a precaution of national safety, lest some adversary might see and copy them to the prejudice of Old England. To the principal librarian I pointed out that if they were so antique, they would be more likely to mislead and injure an enemy than assist him ; for the enemy would certainly fall into a trap if he expected to find things as they were a hundred years ago. And the gentleman concurred in my belief, but stated that the book was sealed by order of the Government, and that without an order from the Government it would not be opened. Denials whet desire, and I was now hankering feverishly for the forbidden fruit. I wrote an argumentative letter to the librarian, formally applying for permission to open the sealed packet, mentioning as references all the best men I could think of, including one or two War Office and Admiralty people, who could testify that I was neither a Russian nor a Soudanese. Then I handed in the letter, returned the book with the seal intact, received my voucher, and went home to wait. TNext day the postman brought me word from the librarian that my application had been forwarded to the War Office, and for a whole month the War Office was debating this momentous matter, until at last a little friendly influence settled the point in my favour. An officer, who was fortunately familiar with modern Woolwich, was sent to the British Museum, and I had the extreme satisfaction of seeing the sealed packet ripped open and its contents disclosed. The first sheet which I opened was \u2014 An exact plan of the town of Woolwich, His Majesty's Dockyard and Ropewalk, surveyed hy John Barker, with a plan of the Warren as surveyed in 1748, and a view from Prince Rupert's Walk of the Royal Academy, Laboratory, &c, surveyed and drawn by John Barker, 1749. This was a real prize. Every house as it stood close upon a hundred and fifty years ago ! every garden-plot laid out according to the fancy of the dead and forgotten occupier ; and a thousand details for study, reflection, and deduction. But I hurried on, and, after passing two or three more plans, I came upon \u2014 The North Prospect of Woolwich in the County of Kent, drawn by S. & N. Buck in 1739. And two churches, cheek by jowl, on the summit of the churchyard mount !"], [76, "4 INTRODUCTION.

Such of these as have special interest, and do not repeat each other, will be found reproduced in this work, for the polite librarian had great pleasure in informing me that the Secretary of State for War had no objection to my making copies thereof, and the gentleman in charge of the map department was instructed to afford me the neces sary facilities for this purpose, which he did most heartily and thoroughly. I fancied that the British Museum people shared some of my joy at the breaking down of this ancient and useless barrier. To me a new world was opened, and it was this fortunate discovery which determined the idea I had long cherished of collating and publishing \" The Records of the Woolwich District.\" To this effort, it is needless to say, I have had to bring many other resources, the nature of which will appear as the book proceeds. It may well be supposed that the labour has not been light, but it has been deeply absorbing and pleasant, and it has been amply repaid by many strange revelations, as well as by the generous kindness and help which have met me at every step of my search. That I have been enabled to procure so many pictorial illustrations, most of them now printed for the first time, though the hands which drew them have been for gene rations past at rest, is a fact sufficient to show that my exertions have not been fruitless. These will not only elucidate the Records of Wool wich, but in a surprising manner illuminate the past ages of Plumstead, Charlton, Kidbrook, Shooters' Hill, and the whole district to which I have, in more or less degree, as will hereafter appear, extended my inquisition.

The Earliest Records. \u2014 Dealing as we are with records, rather than with speculative history, we will commence with that most respect- able authority, the Domesday Book. It is true that the chronicles of Woolwich may carry us back, if but vaguely, to the earlier days of good King Alfred and Canute, when, according to the ecclesiastical authorities, there was a parish church at Woolwich under the care of the Holy Fathers of Lewisham so soon as a.d. 964. This one circum- stance is almost a temptation to muse upon the probabilities of \" Wool- wich under the Saxons \" or \"under the Danes,\" but there really are no evidences sufficiently reliable to be regarded as matter-of-fact re- cords until after the Norman conquest. Of course there are vestiges far more ancient than the records, and folks who are minded to indulge in hypotheses may readily find materials in the relics turned up from the soil for reconstructing a picture of the Roman occupation ; should they desire to penetrate still farther, they have tumuli at Shooters' Hill and Plumstead Common as texts for chapters upon the Celts and Druids ; while the flint implements which have been picked up so often in our dry watercourses may be so many books in which to read the stories of the old Stone Age. But for the present we propose to deal so far as we can with ascertained facts and absolute proofs, and discard all inferences that are not positively indispensable. We begin, then, with the Domesday Book \u2014 that useful assessment of his kingdom made by William the Conqueror in 1086 ; just a little over eight hundred years ago. It is, we find, erroneous in many particulars, even as an assessment book might be to-day, but it is entitled to all the rever- ence which is due to age, and it claims a certain amount of reliance as an official document.

In the time of King Edward and afterwards and now it is worth seven pounds. Two brothers held this land of the King for two manors ; Goduin and Aluuard.\" Early Taxes. \u2014 With the exception of the Domesday Book, the early records are, as might be supposed, almost exclusively ecclesiastical, and these will be found hereafter properly classified. It may be stated here, however, as an evidence of the relative importance of these old villages, that a taxation for church purposes, made in 1291 by Edward I., shows the following assessments : Cherlton, \u00a35 ; Wolewich, \u00a36 13s. 4d. ; Plumstead, \u00a36 13s. 4d. ; Earheth (Erith), \u00a35 6s. 8d. Save such brief references as these, there are no literary remains to enlighten the obscurity of our local history in the early times, and all we can learn from them is that Woolwich and her neighbours were at the period of the Conquest merely rural parishes, but prosperous beyond the agricultural degree by reason of their plenteous fisheries. The rivers and the seas were always sources of man's food, and it may confidently be asserted that wherever the banks of the Thames afforded a suitable landing place there men have been located from the earliest times.

It jutted out in the midst of flat marshes, for it was founded upon a solid spur of chalk which crops up * \" Bordars \" and \" villans \" are supposed to have been the tenant farmers and peasantry of the \" ville \" lands. All the authorities agree that there were never, so far as history goes, any \" villians,\" or bondsmen, in Kent. In a suit tried under Act of 30th King Edward I., the defendant pleaded that she was free, and the jury found that her father was born in Kent, whereupon judgment was given that she was free, for there were no villiens in Kent. \u2014 Robinson's \" Gavelkind,\" 351.

Indeed, there are not wanting direct evidences in support of the assumption just made that the sites of all the towns south of the river were occupied by ancient communities of people \u2014 their villages, camps, and fortifications. Ancient Camps. \u2014 The summit of the cliff behind Woodland Ter race, at Charlton, within the northern enclosure of Hanging Wood, was another commanding position ; it was one which could never have been neglected by the crudest strategist, and, although we know not whether the terraces which we follow down the grass-grown slopes represent the intrenchments of Briton, Roman, Saxon, or Dane, there are sure proofs of the site having been occupied as a fortified camp, probably by more than one of the powers which succeeded to the soil. Similar indications, but less legible, appear in other parts of Hanging Wood, and on the various \" combes \" of Charlton, and others are to be found about Shooters' Hill and the chain of prominences stretching away through Plumstead and Abbey Wood to Erith. A Roman Settlement. \u2014 The authorities incline to the supposition that the camp in Hanging Wood is R,oman, and remains have been Roman Vases, dug up in the Royal Arsenal, 1851, and now in the Royal Artillery Institution. discovered which show undoubtedly that Woolwich was a Roman settlement. In the early part of the year 1853, as some convicts were"], [89, "WOOLWICH. 11 employed in digging a drain in the Carriage Department of the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, they turned up a considerable number of vessels and^ones, among which were the three vases figured in the accompany ing illustration. In the largest of these vessels were remains of human be -*\u2022 and in the others ashes. Although of common material, the fpii oiof these vases are remarkable, and denote them to be of Roman art. \"Unfortunately they were much injured by the picks and spades use_ by the convicts in opening them in the expectation of finding money in them. They were of red brick ground, with an elegant raised pattern of darker hue, the relieved portion being comparatively entire. From this discovery it has been contended that the site of the Royal Arsenal was a Roman cemetery. The remains of the vases are preserved in the Royal Artillery Institution at Woolwich. Roman Cemetery at Wickham Lane. \u2014 The more recent unearthing at Wickham Lane of a leaden coffin and skeleton, with other remains, all, beyond question, of the Roman epoch, emphasize the certainty of Woolwich having been the site of a Roman settlement, and, as the burial-places of that marvellous people were always placed by the roadside, we are justified in concluding that the roads adjacent to the remains here mentioned are very ancient indeed. It was in January, 1887, that workmen were digging for the foundations of new houses near the junction of King's Highway with Wickham Lane, when they came upon this leaden coffin about three feet deep, perfectly preserved in loamy soil. It contained the skeleton of a female, also perfect, in length 5 feet 6 inches, and near to it were some potsherds such as the Romans were accustomed to place with their dead. A skull and other portions of a man's skeleton, without any remnant of sarco phagus, were also lying near, and impart to the burial-place the character of a public cemetery such as the Romans established outside their cities, both in Italy and wherever they went to conquer and to colonize. The leaden coffin, which had upon the lid a border of blue beadwork such as may be seen on other specimens preserved, was, according to the best authorities, of some date between a.d. 200 and 400, and, by the light of exhaustive researches into the subject, some have assigned it distinctly to the first half of the fourth century. It has also been assumed that the deceased was a lady of rank, as only persons of wealth could afford the luxury of lead, and the accepted theory of all the experts who investigated the matter pointed to the existence at the time of a neighbouring villa as the country residence of some senator or centurion. The site of the house, if ever found, will probably be near one of the two streams which trickle down from the springs of Plumstead Common,* water being a necessity of life * From King's Highway and from the back of Bleak Hill."], [90, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 12 which was particularly studied by the ancients of every clime. Mr. \\Y G Dawson, on whose land the relics were found, proposed to give them to the Museum at Maidstone, but, the coffin and contents being taken to the mortuary in the churchyard, the vicar insisted on burylno* them in the consecrated soil, from which, after infinite trouble, they were disinterred the following August by Mr. George Payne, of Tunbridge Wells, under a faculty from the Bishop of Rochester.

It may be noticed that there are crosses on the lid and head of the coffin. To these marks arch\u00e6ologists assign no signi ficance, but the theory has been started that they are Christian symbols. The interment, being north and south, was unquestionably pagan, and to reconcile the apparent contradiction, it is suggested that the old Roman family were secret converts to the new faith, and had roughly and clandestinely carved the crosses for conscience' sake. That the"], [91, "13 WOOLWICH. remains were Roman admits of no question. The coffin is, indeed, one of the most perfect specimens in existence. The beadmark round the edge is well preserved both in form and colour, the blue pigment or enamel being almost perfect. The articles of pottery, which are usually found in such burying-places, were dug up close by, but the heathen propitiatory coins were absent. Roman money has been found at various times by the farm labourers on the adjacent land, but, though search was made, nothing of the kind was discovered near the interments. The pottery included one good vase, probably from the old IJpchurch works, which produced the finest ware in Kent ; the ruder kind were probably manufactured in the locality. The brick and tilemakers adjacent have met with frequent traces of ancient workings. The urns, &c, are in possession of Mr. Dawson. On Plumstead Common. \u2014 Of another class of burials are the ancient mounds or barrows, of which I think we have two good speci mens in the Woolwich district, the one on Plumstead Common, and tbe ether at Shooters' Hill. The first stands, an almost shapeless hillock, out in the centre of the eastern division of the Common, beyond the Slade, and has undoubtedly proved a temptation to many genera tions of men, including tbe present ; for it was only a few years ago that the writer of these lines surprised the workmen of the Metro politan Board carting it away for the sake of using its loamy soil in the planting of trees around the Common. Tbe nature of the soil, which is quite unlike the arid gravel and sand of the Common, denies the argument that this is a natural hillock, and the material was probably brought from a distance to build the earthen mausoleum of some great chieftain. A timely remonstrance addressed to the Metro politan Board saved the relic before it had lost much of its bulk, but our forefathers appear to have shown it less mercy. It has probably been opened and ransacked many times. There are depressions across it north to south, and east to west, which may either mark the lines of excavations, or show where the cross-passages of the tumulus have fallen in.

It ought to be said that the inhabitants see no remoter purpose for this mound than that of a butt for artillery practice, and, having met with B"], [92, "14 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. the accompanying sketch (a manuscript which I have been permitted to copy at the Royal Artillery Institution), I was for a moment doubt ful. It forms part of a map of Plumstead Common drawn about 1740, and represents a party of Gentlemen Cadets at mortar practice, standing near the western end of the Common, for the range is marked \" 1,800 paces.\" Close examination and mature consideration have, however, strengthened my first belief. The character of the soil, the great breadth of the mound, its circular shape and general appearance, all combine against the assumption of its being a mere butt, although there is no doubt that, being convenient, it was put to practical use by the early artillerymen. I am convinced that it was originally the burial-place or monument of some prehistoric personage. At Shooters' Hill. \u2014 The Shooters' Hill barrow is now enclosed within the fence of Tower House, but can be seen from Shrewsbury Lane, at the corner of the footpath leading to Shrewsbury House. Until about 1860 there was at this spot a large uncultivated space called \" The Eurze-field,\" and the mound now in question was a favourite rendezvous for picnic parties. Supposing it to be an ancient \" bury,\" of which I have no evidence beyond its external aspect, it has been much better preserved than that of Plumstead Common, and some day it may be worth while to investigate it. The position, at least, is strongly corroborative of its suspected character, for it is most prominently placed. The Uame of Woolwich. \u2014 Whoever were its inhabitants, Wool wich, so far as we know, has always borne the same name, though many ways spelt; and, unlike its sisters, Plumstead and Charlton, which have numerous namesakes, Woolwich enjoys a monopoly of its cogno mination. There is indeed a corner of a parish, Wimlingswold, in Kent, north-east of Barham Downs, below Canterbury, which bears the appellation of \" Woolwich Wood ; \" but this is probably only a reflected title, as it was from this wood in the early years of the British navy that the mother dockyard of England obtained much of the timber for building her ships.* The origin and signification of the name is doubt ful and obscure. We have seen that it is called \" Hulviz \" in the Domesday Book (1086), and this has been interpreted \"The dwelling on the creek,\" but the Domesda}* scribe was not particular in his orthography, an accomplishment which has only quite recently come into fashion. At one time everybody spelt just as he pleased, and the different writers have rung the changes on the designation of this town in every conceivable form. But, excepting the writer of the Domesday, and one other eccentric individual who was a pioneer * In 1594 the wood was rented bv Queen Elizabeth, but Her Majesty took a twenty-one years' lease of it in 1600 at .\u00a35 a-year."], [93, "WOOLWICH. 15 shipwright in the primitive dockyard under Henry VIII., and invented a way of his own in calling it \"Owllwiche,\" all the old authorities allowed it to begin with \" W.\" Indeed, we find that it had that initial even before the Norman Conqueror took his famous inventory, which shows conclusively that \" Hulviz \" was a corruption and must not be accepted as evidence of the primal source.

Thus it meant street, village, camp, castle, house, place of work, &c. Wicli, in our case a corruption of Wic, generally implies \" salt springs.\" Nothing is more reasonable to suppose than that the compiler of Domesday found the Anglo-Saxon wic and the Norman viz convert ible terms, and pardonably preferred his own tongue. The only explanation of his first syllable which I can offer is that he may have been misled by the sound, which, if we give the u a broad pronunci ation, renders \"hul\" (hool), and \"wool\" not unlike, especially when we imagine them spoken with a provincial dialect.

One of the most curious of the fore going is the second example, already referred to, which seems to have come from an application of the French equivalent Ou for the initial W ; but it was nearly imitated in the address of a letter which puzzled the Post Office some few years ago : \u2014 Peter Robertson, 2 Compney 7 Batilian, Rolyl Atirian Owilige, England. * Thomas Philipot, in his \" Kent Survey\" of 1659, says :\u2014 \" Wolwich has been in elder times written Wolnewich.\" But his Etymology in the same volume declares it was \"anciently written Woldwich, that is, the turning river under the would.\""], [94, "16 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Our part in English History. \u2014 We do not find many references to Woolwich amid the historical literature of early England, but, like the rest of the county of Kent, the place seems to have had a hand in most ofthe famous insurrections. The people of Kent, especially in the Metropolitan section, were counted amongst the most cultivated as well Blaekheath Hill and view of Old London, Seventeenth Century. as the most valiant of Englishmen, and it was but natural that they should have their share in all popular movements, whether for good or for evil. The Jack Cade rebellion, for instance, was not the rabble riot which is sometimes supposed. Amongst seventy-four gentlemen who were pardoned for taking part with John Cade in the rising of the Commons of Kent, in 1450, are enumerated Thomas Hethe and William Northampton, both of Woolwich, and with the latter is associated \" Richard Lovelace de Bj*ngesdoin, gentilman.\"* Those of lower order engaged in the same conspiracy who went from Woolwich were Thomas Attewode, Simon Shipton, Robert Newdegate, William Pegge, Joseph Edwyn, Robert Egell, John Frost, and Nicholas Atte Gore. From \" Plumstede \" went John Cokke and John Crabbe of Borstall, Robert Ricarde and Robert Drynker. A blank time. \u2014 We propose to deal separately with the ecclesiastical chronicles, and it is partly due to this arrangement that the infancy of Woolwich may seem barren in this history. Nearly all the events and interests of localities at that period are bound up in the Church, and it may almost be said that, prior to the reigns of the Tudors, Woolwich has no history. The world of London knew of it only as a pleasant little village, a halting place in a day's sail upon the river. The King's court at Eltham had it within its manor, and occasionally came across * In all probability ancestor of Richard Lovelace, the poet.

So little, however, was Woolwich thought of, even in the days of Elizabeth, when the nucleus of a dockyard had been established, that Lambarde, the historian and topographer of Kent, writing in 1596, does not mention it except in his schedules, although he lived close by, at Westcombe, Charlton. Machyn's Diary. \u2014 Somewhat earlier, however, we have a few notices of the place in the diary of Henry Machyn, the merchant tailor, which may be extracted in all the freshness of his early English ; \u2014 The vj. day of July, 1551, the Kynges grace (Edward VI.) rod through Grenwichye Parke into Blake heth, and my Lord of Darbe and my Lord of Warwyke, and odur lordes and knyghts and gentyllmen and trumpeters playhyng and aile tlie gardes in ther dobelets and ther hosse with bowes and arrowes ij and ij to-gether, and ther the Kynges grace ran at the ryng on Blake heth.

Thus : \u2014 Gilbert de Maurisco held it in the early part of Edward the I.'s reign, about 1272. Sabina de Windefore, or Windsor, had it in 1324. The Earl of Hereford (Humphrey Bohun) was its owner prior to 1327. Sir John Pulteney died possessed of it in 1349. Thomas de Charlton and John Reveil, members of the Pulteney family, had the estate until 1374. Nicholas Lovayne, Aubrey de Vere, and others succeeded. William Chichele, youngest brother of Archbishop Chichele, held the estate about 1400. John Chichele, son of William, inherited it and it passed to Sir Thomas Knollys, who gave it in marriage with his daughter, Agnes,* to John Tattersall, 1447. Sir Ralph Hastings married Tattersall's daughter Anne and had the manor ot Woolwich. He was brother of Lord Willoughby. The Boughtonst of Burwash Court, Plumstead. came into possession ofthe manor somewhat later. Richard Heywood (or Heyden) purchased it of Nicholas Boughton in 1554. Christopher Heywood (or Heyden) sold it to William Gilbourne, citizen and draper, of London, in 1580. Sir Nicholas Gilbourne, son of William, settled it on his son Henry, who died without issue, and it descended to Elizabeth, daughter of his brother, Thomas Gilbourne, Esq., of Woolwich. She married \u2014 Sir Leger Scroop, of Louth, who died involved, and an Act of Parliament relieved the widow by sale of the estate to \u2014 Richard Bowater, sen., mercer, and Richard Bowater, jun., linen-draper, of the City of London, in 1692, for \u00a311,800, and the nominal sum of 5s. each to the widow and her second husband, Thomas Aspin, of the Middle Temple. The estate was still entitled \" the Manor of Woolwich.\" Captain Bowater owned the property in 1795, but at that time the \" Manor of Woolwich \" was leased by the crown to Sir John Shaw and did not include this estate. Captain Varlo, Royal Marines, occupied the \" Manor House\" in 1811. It was also known as Bowater House,+ and stood on the site of the Red Barracks. The estate consisted, when Tattersall (or Tattershall) had it in 1447, of two messuages (dwelling-houses and land adjoining), three tofts,\u00a7 140 acres of arable, 12 acres of meadow, 24 acres of marsh, and 166 acres of wood. * Agnes was one of a remarkable family of twenty-four children. t See \" Records of Plumstead,\" &c.

He and his descendants leased the Crown rights of Eltham and Woolwich for several generations, and in 1695 he alleged in the Court of Exchequer that he was entitled to rents, fines, duties, and services due to the King, that the sum of <\u00a33 8d., formerly paid by Mr. Boughton to the Manor of Eltham for land in Woolwich, on the south side of the town, had ceased for some time, and that the crown was likely to be disinherited. Richard Bowater disputed the claim, declaring that he knew not that the lands were in the Manor of Eltham. But the Barons of the Exchequer decreed that the estate was within the Manor, and Bowater agreed to pay \u00a3Z 8d. yearly rent, with thirty years' arrears. A commission was appointed in 1696 to define the boundaries of the estate, which extended from Hogg Lane (Nile Street) and the Rope Yard (Beresford Street), including a messuage called \" The Naked Boy,\"* to Collickf Lane and Woolwich Common, Little Heath, Hanging Wood, and the manor-way J parting Woolwich and Charlton level. Part of the property stretched east to the \"water course\" at Brookhill, and the boundaries compassed the whole of the town excepting the Vicar's Glebe, the King's Yard, a small portion next Plumstead, including the Warren or Royal Arsenal, and part of the river side of High Street.

And notwithstanding the Exchequer suit, a Court Leet and Court Baron were held yearly for the Manor of Woolwich, even in Hasted's time (1778), and at the Court Leet the jury appointed \" two constables and two ale-tasters for the town and parish of Woolwich.\" Indeed the allegiance of Woolwich to Eltham was frequently disputed and ignored ; nevertheless it is certain that for ages past, down almost to our own time, the Manor of Eltham was master of Woolwich.

Sand and Salmon. \u2014 It will be something like a revealment to find that the early days of Woolwich were largely devoted to sand and salmon. Surprising \" nuggets \" often reward those who labour in the arch\u00e6o- logical mine, but I was particularly astonished one morning when, in digging among some old MS. records for fossils of the Dockyard, I came upon a very jewel of local history which seemed to throw a new and unsuspected light upon the bygone days of Woolwich. The MS. was a volume picked up at a sale in London in 1861, and lately added to the National Library. It was written by the Rev. Thomas Austin, who was Vicar of Hoo, below Gravesend, and it bears the date of 1767. Its contents are chiefly topographical notes on Kent, some original and some evidently borrowed from older sources, and of the latter character appears to be the extract which I am about to quote. It should be premised that Woolwich Dockyard in 1767 went no farther than the present main gate, opposite Chapel Street. The Sand Trade. \u2014 Our extract is part of a letter dated 1762, which first recounts particulars of a visit to Greenwich, and then pro- ceeds as follows : \u2014 \"The captain, contrary to his intention or desire, being obliged to call at Woolwich, we walked thither Having spent ye evening very temperately, considering the manner of such partings, we went on board the captain's six-oared boat at ye west end of the yard, where almost all ye sand used by the housewives of London is put on board barges from carts which bring it down from ye neighbouring hill.\""], [106, "24 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. The neighbouring hill ! Who that knows the Dockyard Station, and has looked upon the high cliffs now surmounted by the Red Barracks, has not felt curious to learn how, when, and why all that tremendous scooping out of earth had taken place ? Long before the railway came through with its cutting there was a concavity there from which many thousand tons of soil must have at some time been removed, and an imaginary thread drawn in the air from the hill on the north of the line, over the houses in North Kent Terrace, to the top of the Barrack cliff will show the dimensions of the slice out.* And this, we are told by Vicar Austin has for time indefinite gone to sand the parlour floors of that old View of Woolwich from the Bowater Sandpits.

Sand was, until a quite recent date, in universal use for this service, and its ancient purpose still survives, not only in country houses, but in many old-fashioned inns even in our towns. Only think ! Probably before the Dockyard was dreamt of, this sand-mine was at work, and a staple industry of our honest progenitors in the dawning days of England's greatness may have been this furnish ing of the silver grit with which the wives and damsels of the worthy old citizens of London town garnished their chamber floors, and polished their household powter \u2014 pots and plates and dishes. The Bowater Sandpit.\u2014 That this depression at the Dockyard Station was an old sandpit ought to have been surmised, but I have never heard the fact suggested until I saw in Hasted's \" History of Kent \" (1777 \u2014 90) a notification that Mr. Paul Sandby t proposed to publish \" by subscription at two guineas,\" in \"a new method called aqua-tinta \" \u2014 * See sketch, page 18. t Mr. Paul Sandby was chief drawing-master at the Royal Military Academy, and retired in 1797 after a long and honourable service of thirty years.

These two, with Sandby's, may be compared to show how little change the scene underwent in a long series of years. They also indicate the unison of artistic taste in the selection of so eligible a standpoint. All three, and two or more others which I have met with, are taken from the hill which we now ascend from the Dockyard. Coleman Street appears to have been created at the earliest period repre sented by these sketches, and probably Charles Street also. The third row of houses in Gastineau's view is apparently the west end of Powis Street, at that time regarded as part of Edward Street, from whence it sprung. The Dockyard Station. \u2014 Before the Dockyard Station was built (a.d. 1845), the great sandpit had been little used sor many years \u2014"], [108, "26 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. probably not since 1806, when Mr. Bowater sold his house and grounds for the Marine Barracks \u2014 and a great pond of water had formed in the hollow. The houses in Coleman Street and King Street were at first continuous, but an opening was made by the railway to form Station Queen Street Chapel, Woolwich, showing Part of the Site of thc Dockyard Railway Station. Sketched about 1835. Road. North Kent Terrace was built at the same time, and a good deal of the hollow was filled up with borings from Blaekheath tunnel. No testimony is needed beyond our own vision to identify the great hollow at the Dockyard Station with \" Mr. Bowater's Sandpits \" (the \"Sandpits at Woolwich,\" referred to by Sandby), seeing that Mr. Bowater's house stood on \" Mount Pleasant,\" just where the Red Barracks now stands, in evidence of which there are several maps and plans hereafter to appear. The Pattison Sandpit. \u2014 There were, however, sandpits at Wool wich in addition to Bowater's, and altogether the old town did a good trade in its mineral productions. At the other side of Woolwich was Mr. Pattison's pit, and the family at \" Burrage House \" were rivals in commerce with the squires of Mount Pleasant. The Arsenal Station. \u2014 Pattison's pit is now partly occupied by the Arsenal Station, and it is somewhat remarkable that the railway should have intersected both these hollows, and that each should have become the site of a station. It is probable, however, that the engi neers found them convenient on account of the levels and made their plans to fit the situation."], [109, "WOOLWICH. 27 They were anxious, no doubt, to save expense in excavating, for the cost of the tunnels and cuttings through Woolwich had been great, notwithstanding the uti lisation of the surplus earth by taking it lower down, to form the em bankment over Plum stead Marshes. Built in the Sand pit. \u2014 Built within the Bowater pits are not only the Dockyard Sta tion, but the whole of Station Road, North Kent Grove, and North Kent Terrace. But, broader than Mr. Bo- Aspect of Pattison's Sandpit in 1887.

The edge of the cliff is marked by Crescent Road, and by the high garden of the Walpole Tavern, where it rises a sheer sixty feet from the end of Walpole Place. Indeed, although some of the roads have been artifi cially raised, the back gardens of nearly all the houses within the limits described still show the depth of the ancient sand - searching indentation. Some idea of this depth may be found by adding to the height of the cliffs the mea surement of a sunken area at the corner of Spray Street and Tay lor's Buildings, behind the railway station.

Station may afford an approximate notion of the Pattison pits when in full swing. Burrage House. \u2014 I have been much disappointed in failing to find a view of \"Burrage House,\" full as it is of interesting associations connected with the locality. But in the plan of Woolwich made by John Barker in 1745, which we shall presently see, there is some indication of the sandpit ; and the orchard which stood between the house and Plumstead Road, and remained until the buildings disap peared about 1848, is also sketched. Reference may be likewise made to a plan of the Burrage Estate in 1801 (see Plumstead Records), which shows the position and extent of the house at that time, with a lake or pond in front. Furthermore I have the plan made in 1844, for the construction of the North Kent Railway (see Plumstead), and a plan prepared for the Woolwich Town Commissioners in 1845, both of which show the position and extent of the mansion and grounds \u2014 at that time long abandoned as a country seat, and devoted to the cultivation of juvenile Woolwich under the direction of the Rev. J. Bickerdike. Men now growing grey remember the old house and playground, and the weary days on which they \" lagged unwillingly to school,\" along the too short lane from the back entrance in Spray's Buildings. The railway took in a large part of the estate on the north side, including most of the site upon which Parry Place is built. The remainder southward is the Pattison or Burrage Estate to this day, respecting which there is much more to be said by-and-by. Charlton Pits. \u2014 To these two pits may be added the equally extensive and probably much older pit between Woodland Terrace, Charlton, and the Lower Road. The strata, however, is at this place not sand such as is suitable for domestic uses, but soil far more valuable for other purposes, and inexpressibly interesting to the student of nature on account of the rich deposits of fossils enfolded in its many layers. Various geologists have commented on the splendid section revealed in this cutting. This, however, must also stand over, as it will be referred to in the chapters on Charlton. Its connection with the subject under notice may be justified if necessary by quoting one of the writers of the last century, who says \u2014 At the east end of the town is a chalk-pit, which has a stratum abounding with the same extraneous fossils as that at Charlton. Plumstead Pits. \u2014 There might also be included in the category of old pits the cavernous holes at the remoter extremity of Plumstead Common, celebrated in an exciting time of modern history as \" Jacobs's sandpits.\" These furnish a peculiar loam, which is in much request"], [111, "WOOLWICH. 29 for metal casting ; but they were probably worked in the olden time for the silver sand which formed the slope of the great hills, now gnawed into in all directions. This material is very clean, and, like that of the Pattison and Bowater pits, may well have been in request when \" Sand 0 ! \" was one of the old London cries, which we see illustrated in picture-books of the period, and the old round of \u25a0 \" White sand and grey sand ! Who'll buy my white sand ? Who'll buy my grey sand ?\" was a refrain well understanded of the people. Ships' Ballast. \u2014 It may reasonably be conjectured, although Austin aforesaid does not mention it, that a good deal of the coarser earth excavated went away in ships as ballast. There were, for in stance, many vessels coming from the North with coals to London, which would require ballast to make up deficiencies of cargo in returning, and what more natural than that they should take it from Woolwich ? For if they wanted sand there was plenty of it. It was possibly an article of merchandise for which they had a market else where, and it was easily taken on board at a safe berth in deep water. We can see on the early maps the \" Sand Quay \" which Austin refers to, marked where the Dockyard then terminated, opposite Chapel Street and just where the Dockyard steps are;* and I fancy that, before the ballast wharves at Erith and East Greenwich (Angerstein's) came into being, there was a busy ballast wharf on this spot. The Churchyard Cliff. \u2014 It is reasonable also to imagine that the cutting down of the hill on which the churchyard is now perched may in the very early days have had this same origin, for it has not been gravel sor road-making that has been taken away, but sand, and sand only. There were others beside the great landowners who were interested in the sand question, for in the Home Office records we find that in 1688 and in 1694, Thomas Aspin and his wife petitioned the Com missioners of the Navy to remove a conduit for water and leaden pipes that had been placed in their ground at Woolwich during the Civil War, and hindered their digging for sand, which, as the navy is mentioned, must have been somewhere near the Dockyard. And, some what earlier, in 1666, we read that the Government was in treaty for a seventeen years' lease of two ballast wharves, two ballast pits, two lime kilns, and two tenements. It was stated that one wharf, being near the yard, was convenient for storing timber, and that the Royal Navy could be ballasted from the pits and wharves at a saving of \u00a3500 a year. * See Buck's view, page 5 (Plate IV.), and Barker's plan, page 41. C"], [112, "30 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. We are also told that all the glasshouses in London used the Woolwich sand sor their work, and we find it stated that the Norwegian ships sold the ballast at home \u2014 the chalk for lime, and the sand for all sorts of uses. So much for sand. The Salmon Fishery. \u2014 But wherefore \" salmon\" ? Because the chronicles tell us that in the early days of which we have been speak ing, Woolwich was a flourishing fishing-place, and, although William the Conqueror could get no more than three pounds a-year in taxes out of the inhabitants, its salmon fishery was even in his time regarded as valuable. And not alone salmon. There is in the Rolls of Parliament a petition from \" the poor lieges of Lesnes, Plumstede, Earheth, and Woolwych,\" &c, presented to King Richard II. about 1380, pray ing his Majesty's protection against encroachments on their fishing grounds, to which the king graciously assented by ordering the nets which were complained of to be removed forthwith. Again, in the seventeenth year of the same reign (1393-4), we find the people of Woolwich and Plumstead complaining to the king of being prevented fishing in the Thames at their appointed seasons for the \" supply of the adjacent country and the City of London.\" And then a statute appears under King Richard's sign-manual, in which the fish which were the due and privilege of these same fishermen of \" Plumstede and Wool wych,\" and the rest, are described as \" troutes and saumons, pikes, roches, barbils, and other fish.\" Lord Mayor and Fishermen. \u2014 In the reign of Edward II. (1320) we learn from the ancient Letter Books of the City of London that \u2014 Master John le Fishmongere rand others produced at the Guild Hall, before the Lord Mayor* and Aldermen, sixteen nets called kidels, taken in the Thames while under the charge of John de Pelham, fishmonger of Wolwiche, and John Godgrom of Plomsted : who said that the same kidels belonged to certain men of Plumstede, Lesnes, Berkynge, and Erhethe, who were there named ; and that the said kidels were placed in the water aforesaid, to the destruction of the small fish and salmon, &c. It was therefore judged by the said Mayor and Aldermen that the kidels should be burnt, and that the said fishmongers, on the peril which awaits them, should not commit the like offence again. The lawful measure of the meshes of Thames nets at this time was two inches from one knot to the next nearest knot.\" The Holy Friars. \u2014 Our neighbours the monks not alone used nets too fine in the mesh, but seem to have resorted to other sharp practices sor catching more than their share of the fish. * The Lord Mayor of London had jurisdiction as far as Gravesend. \u2014 Stow, 1720."], [113, "WOOLWICH. 31 In 1313, according to a letter in Latin preserved among the archives of Edward IL, a certain kidel belonging to the Abbot of Lesnes was found in the course of the banks of the Thames, opposite the Abbey of Lesnes, and brought before the Mayor and Aldermen of London and adjudged to be burnt, such net being \"too narrow in the meshes, and insufficient for fishing, to the undoing of the banks of the said river, and to the loss of the whole city, and of the people resorting thereto.\" All such kidels and dams thrown up in the river to entrap the fish were pronounced contrary to the Great Charter of the Liberties of the People of England. Condemned and Burnt. \u2014 On October 28th, 1344, a net called a \" codnet \" was taken on the Thames from \" Robert Pesok of Plumstede,\" and brought before the Mayor and Aldermen of London at Guildhall, when six fishmongers on oath declared such net to be unlawful and false, and it was ordered to be burnt \" near the Stone Cross in the high street of Chepe.\" A Fishing Tumult. \u2014 Henry IV. 'ascended the throne in 1399, and the Woolwich fishermen continued to figure under his regime. In the Guildhall White Book it is written in Norman French that a sub conservator of the Thames, named Bonar, seized sixteen nets belonging to the fishermen of Woolwich, Erith, and Barking, because the meshes of the nets were not according to the statutory limit of two inches from knot to knot. This Bonar made a complaint before the Court at West minster that the fishermen had followed and assailed him, and threatened to take their nets again and do him violence, by which the majesty of the law had been affronted, and the offenders placed in grievous peril. On the 21st of February, in the seventh year of King Henry IV. (1406), the ringleaders were taken before the Court at Westminster, and were found guilty, to their great dismay ; but the Archbishop of Canterbury interceded for them, and they were pardoned by the Lord Mayor, who furthermore gave them back their nets \"with his own hands.\" Big Fish. \u2014 Of a certainty there was other fish than salmon. Those curious old pamphlets which were the progenitors of the daily papers tell us that \u2014 On the 13th August, 1627, a fish called a grampus, of 10 yards long, about 5 feet high, and of the like breadth, was shot with musketts and taken near Woolwich. And a little later we have the \u2014 Relation of a terrible monster taken by a fisherman neere Wollage, July the 15, 1642, the shape whereof is like a toad, but that which makes it a monster is that it hath hands with fingers and is chested like a man, being neere sive foot long and three foot over, the thicknesse of an ordinary man. Friday morning, between 4 and 5 of the clock in the morning, a little above Wollage, one Thomas West casting his"], [114, "32 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. net upon the comming in of the tide for salmon, upon drawing in of the net, he sees in the net a fiend, not a fish. ... It was brought on shore alive, and a butcher's wife who saw it started with a shriek, crying, Oh, the devill in the shape of a great fish ! swoonded, and was faine to be carried out. Never any of this strange kind hath beene seene by any age before. Histories do with constant consent maintain that all unusual births on sea or on land have been the harbingers of tumults and desolation. God in his mercy grant that this ugly monster may not for our sins prove the like to us. There is much more of the same sort, concluding with a solemn prayer of a strong Conservative flavour. The monster was probably an octopus. There are several records of whales of as much as fifty feet long being captured above Woolwich, at which spot the water was at high tide salt. In the year just quoted (1642), there appears to have been three of these visitors in company, for the chronicle proclaims \u2014 Newes from Gravesend and Greenwich, being an exact and most faithful Relation of 2 miraculous and monstrous Fishes, first descovered in Rainham Creek 'and after wards pursued by fishermen in the Thames, and the biggest killed and boiled for oil at Gravesend, the other at Greenwich, which was one and twenty feet in length and six feet over, and likewise a less than either made its escape to the sea again. But the lesser kinds of fish were probably of most value as regular prey. Pennant, in his \" Journey to the Isle of Wight,\" writing of Woolwich in 1801 says \u2014 Sprats come up the river in November in great numbers, continue till March, and are a great relief to the poor. They are constantly followed by the speckled grebe, caUed here the sprat loon, from their feeding on that fish. The great sepia is very frequent where the salt water reaches, and is found of a considerable size. From these records, then, we learn that sand and salmon were of pecu liar interest to the people of Woolwich hundreds of years ago, especially before a more solid industry arose in the establishment of a Royal Dockyard."], [115, ""], [116, "View of Woolwich in 1662.

The drawing on the opposite page is by Jonas Moore, Surveyor of Ordnance in 1662, and although a little indistinct, is undoubtedly accurate. The church shown is, of course, the predecessor of the present edifice, and I wish the reader to observe that the high road runs close to the water's edge under the churchyard cliff, with guard-posts along the beach. This part of the road, which is followed by the tramway between High Street and Church Street, is still called \" Dockrails.\" There appears also to have been a wharf and public way along the front of the old town to some distance from this point, and the trees which formed \" The Grove \" leading past the old Rectory are clearly shown.

The Civil War. \u2014 The previous twenty years had covered the range of the Civil War, in which Kent took a prominent and early part. It was reported to the House of Commons on May 26, 1648, that the rebels had advanced as far as Greenwich and Deptford, plundering the houses of members of Parliament on the way, and that Woolwich had also been threatened. \" Some well affected members of the House, who had taken care to remove the ordnance and ammunition from Woolwich to the Tower,\" had the thanks of the House given them for their good service. \u2014 Historical Collections. There were afterwards skirmishes at Crayford, Wrotham, Maidstone, and other parts of Kent, to which county at first the rising was mainly confined. Some of the river watermen and apprentices at Green wich, Woolwich, and Gravesend, who were known to be engaged in it, were at once disfranchised. The movement soon spread into Essex, and the rest is well-known history which need not be repeated here. The King's Deer. \u2014 Of the unfortunate Charles I. it may, how ever, be mentioned that among the state papers of his reign appears an order, dated 1638, forbidding the inhabitants of Woolwich, &c, to hunt certain of the king's deer which may have gone astray. \" Any persons offending herein to have their dogs, guns, and crossbows seized, and their names reported.\" Master William Barnes. \u2014 Under date of 1642, we have a vivid illustration of that unhappy period. It appears in a pamphlet entitled : \"A true and perfect relation of the seizing the house of one Master William Barnes, a Cavalier,\" of course by a \" Roundhead.\" Amongst the rest of the worthy captaines and officers of this famous Parliamentary Army, one Captaine Willoughby, sometimes a sea-captaine, in the County of Kent, having a company of volunteers to the number of one hundred, well affected and stout youngsters, whom he exercised at Gravesend till they were somewhat expert in their arms, and then, desirous to try what good service he could do his king, the Parliament, and his countrey, set forth from Gravesend on Thursday last, and with leisure arrived at Eariffe, where he with his company lodged that night, and the next day came to Wollage upon the Thames, where, having spent some time with his company, notice was given him that in the Ship-carpenters' yard, commonly called the Wood-yard at Wollage, there was the score and fifteen peeces of ordnance which were intended very suddenly privately to be shipped and conveyed to Newcastle for His Majesties service, upon which the said Captaine Willoughby, with his company compleatly armed, marched into the said yard, and there in the name of the Parliament seized the said peeces for the use and service of his Majesty and the Parliament, no opposi- tion being made or attempted, saving that one Mr. William Barnes, a gentleman that lived about a quarter of a mile from the towne, said to some of the souldiers, their captaine and they did more than they could answer when time should serve, that they would be called to an account for what they did, which, being reported to the captaine, he inquired what gentleman he was, which being declared to him he caused"], [119, "WOOLWICH. 35 him to be apprehended, and took order for the securing the peeces till his return, and took about forty of his souldiers with him and went to the house of the said Barnes, which he searched very strictly, but could find nothing to their purpose. Then went they to the stable (one of the souldiers perceiving the said Barnes his eye to be alwayes towards the stable) to see what horses he had fit for service, but finding none at all, asked the said Barnes if hee had not hid any money or plate in any place private, who answ*ered, curse him and sinke him no, upon which as they were depart ing, the souldier that viewed the Gentleman's eyes said hee would take up a planke of the floore before he went, and taking up the same pitched a sticke in the ground and it stuck in ; whereupon they called for a spade and digged about a spit deepe, and cut off a peece of leather of a trunke which they tooke up filled with plate, which they conceived could not bee lesse worth than one thousand pounds ; upon which they digged deeper and found another trunke, in which was many popish bookes, a cope, surplice, beads, and priest's garments, which they seized and brought to Wollage, and forthwith shipped the peeces of ordnance, and with a guard sent them to the Tower, and the rest of the souldiers with the Captaine tooke boate and crossed the water to Blackwall where, about eight of the clocke at night, they cloaked one of the souldiers in the priest's attire and with one of the bookes in his hand by torch light on foot came to the Tower, which, if they had day fight, intended to have come to the Parliament, but being late staid all night at the Tower, and this morning sent to know the Parliament's pleasure, what should be done with the peeces and plate and with the said Barnes, which the)* Apprehended, where they continue expect ing Parliament's Answer concerning the same.

Ship-money. \u2014 While the national discontent was fermenting, our own records were not wanting in evidences. The obnoxious system of taxation known as \" ship-money \" was in operation, and in the year 1634 an assessment was made on all the maritime places between Westminster and Gravesend by virtue of a writ from Charles I., under the Great Seal, \" for setting forth a ship of 500 tons burthen.\" Deptford was charged \u00a343 6s. 5d. ; Greenwich, \u00a3124 4s. lOd. ; Plumstead, \u00a35 5s. 9d. ; Woolwich, \u00a314 15s. 6d. ; and Charlton, \u00a313 10s. 8d. Woolwich was getting on. In addition to ranking as a maritime place, tbe town bad now been classed as a seaport. It is not only so described in tbe Index Villaris of 1690, but it is further shown that the parish then contained the seats of at least three gentlemen. Pepys at Woolwich. \u2014 Samuel Pepys, whose diary I quote more fully in another place, has one or two references to the Woolwich of bis day, which are well-nigh inexplicable. Tbe following be writes under date of \u2014 \" Feb. 27, 1666.

Perhaps we shall some day learn what was a \" Woolwich stone.\" Furthermore, Pepys talks of \" the old woman of Woolwich,\" whose story greatly amused him. We shall be glad to hear who she was and what was her story. Woolwich must have been a pleasant country resort for Londoners only two hundred years ago, when Mr. Pepys could write \u2014 \"28 May, 1667. My wife away down with Jane and Wm. Hewer to Woolwich, in order to a little ayre and to lie there to-night, and so to gather Maydew to-morrow morning, which Mrs. Turner hath taught her is the only thing in the world to wash her face with ; and I am contented with it.\" The house in which Mrs. Pepys slept was in the Dockyard.

They usually bore the initials of the husband and wife, as in the instances here depicted, which are of exact size. Tbe coins represented are, with only one exception, the whole of the Woolwich coins known to exist.* In comparison with other Kentish towns Woolwich has a small collection. No. 1 is the only known example of Lodwick Poole's farthing; it has only recently been discovered, and is now published for the first time.

W. I. F.\" Later Tokens. \u2014 Mr. George Baker tells me of a later Woolwich currency. He and bis father before him have a connection with tbe Royal Arsenal which goes back to the very beginning of this century, and it was from bis father be learnt the history of this peculiar local coinage. The date is about 1820, and tbe occasion was the dilatory system of paying the Government workmen which prevailed even down to that recent period. The wages were usually paid once a month, and then in \u00a31 notes, the consequence of which was a prevalence of credit to an extent of which we can hardly have full conception. It is almost needless to say that this condition of things placed the unfortunate customer at the mercy of the shopkeepers; and some ofthe latter, not content with exacting enormous profits on their goods, insisted when- ever they changed a note on giving a good proportion of their own small cash \u2014 copper pence or tokens which only they and those in league with them would afterwards accept. This imposition became at length so intolerable that, when the Marquis of Anglesea was Master-General his attention was called to it by (it is said) a workman showing to him a double handful of the wretched coins, and he speedily introduced a better method of paying wages. This nearly ruined the truck-shops, for the tokens all came in and bad to be melted down for old copper. If they were coins of recognisable shape it is rather remarkable that none of them are preserved, but they were probably mere bits of metal, rudely stamped and not likely to be treasured up. The last Woolwich Coinage. \u2014 A still more modern Woolwich * From Charlton and Plumstead we have not one."], [122, "38 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. coin, and I believe tbe very latest issued, is in my possession, and there are doubtless many other specimens extant. It is a farthing, well struck, in copper, and thus engraved : Obverse. \u2014 The head of Queen Victoria, surrounded by the words, \"Royal Artillery Canteen, Woolwich.\" Reverse. \u2014 A field gun, and \"Gregory Browne, Wine, Malt Liquor, and Provision Merchant.\" The coin is undated, but Mr. Gregory Browne kept tbe Canteen in tbe Royal Artillery Barracks at Woolwich about 1850, and tbe Camp Canteen for many years after tbe military went into trading on their own account. Trade Signs. \u2014 Reverting to the old coins just depicted, it will be observed that there were either two houses with the sign of the Carpenters' Arms, or that the Carpenters' Arms must have changed tenants between 1650 and 1666 \u2014 an interval of stirring events which changed many things. These tokens were prohibited in 1672, and we cannot trace the position of any house from which they issued. It should be noted, however, that at the period when such coins were current a house sign did not necessarily, as now, denote a tavern. Most shopkeepers and tradesmen had signs to their houses, generally denoting the occupation followed, but not always, for it frequently happened that a bouse altered its business character without disturbing its sign, and tbe symbol of tbe carpenter bas done duty for a bairdresser or a tailor. Inns of Antiquity. \u2014 Nevertheless, although signs do not always represent places of entertainment, it is certain that many taverns which in that day existed have now no place amongst us. The oldest tavern in Woolwich at the present time I believe to be the \"Bell,\" at Bell Watergate, not only from its position at the very source of the town, but from the fact of its mention as lon\"- ago as 1655.* Where the Cage stood.\u2014 In excavating for the foundations of St. Saviour's Schools in 1873, two pewter pots were found, the spot being just under the site of the ancient cage, at the north end of Ropeyard Rails. They were inscribed : \" Mary Hogg, at Ye Bull Head in Wool wich, 1726.\" We can only conjecture that tbe Bull's Head was an inn which stood close by. The Corner of Warren Lane. \u2014 The sketch here given represents a house which stood at the corner of Warren Lane in 1850. Tradition, its appearance, and its position declared it to have been formerly a house of entertainment, and one could well believe tbe legend which told of its ancient importance as a resting stage for London travellers. Tbe * See note * at page 43."], [123, "39 WOOLWICH. locality, we must not forget, was not of the same character as now. This very house was in 1815 the shop of the leading baker of tbe place, and nearly all tbe business of the town was centred there, the fashion able bootmaker patronised by the officers and ladies of the garrison being located close by in Harden' s Lane. But, as the town extended, the new growth withered the old, and, as the neighbourhood of Warren Lane decayed, the whilom inn and bakery descended to tbe status of a common lodging-house for poor travellers. It was known, I believe, Old Tavern at the Corner of Warren Lane, Woolvrkh, 1850, in its latter days as \" Jacob's Ladder,\" consequent upon its interminable staircases. The old house was pulled down some years since and the ground upon which it stood enclosed within the extension of Messrs. Kirk and Randall's works. Woolwich in 1748. \u2014 I have already mentioned Mr. John Barker, the highly skilled and painstaking draughtsman, who lived at Wool wich in 1748, and has placed us under such deep obligations. The most valuable of the records which he has left us is the plan show ing in careful detail tbe whole of the area which the houses then covered a hundred and forty years ago. This plan has been carefully copied for this work, and in order that the scale may be adequate, I have spread it over two pages, the first containing the eastern, and the second the western, division of the town. Old East Woolwich. \u2014 It is almost impossible to exhaust the interest which may be derived from these drawings by an intelligent inhabitant. We see that the whole of the houses which the town could boast were in the line* through Church Street, High Street, and * Seymour in his Survey of Kent (1776) says : \"The town, from the Dock to the Warren, consists of one street, nearly a mile in length.

From Green's End there were but two roads, Love Lane and Cholick* Lane (now Mill Lane), part of which was renamed \"New Road,\" when it was cut through into Plumstead Road about 1780. Round about New Road. \u2014 Taking the plan in detail, and com mencing at the top of the eastern section, we find (\u00bb) Cholic Lane, and (\u00ab) Love Lane, forming the corner which is now faced by the Fortune of War Tavern in New Road. Mr. Pattison's sandpits (b), cover all the area surrounding the Arsenal Railway Station, and extend to Plumstead Road, where the entrance gateway occupied the site of the Mortar Tavern. The stream from Brook Hill Road to Shooters' Hill passed in an open watercourse across the Plumstead Road, and there was a little foot-bridge opposite the spot where the Arsenal Chapel stands. f Only a portion of the great sand and chalk pits already described are here seen, but down Plumstead Road (beyond t), is the circular fence enclosing the entrance to Burwash Court, afterwards Burrage House \u2014 the parent of Burrage Town. The lane which led to the farmbuildings and subsequently became Burrage Road, is shown a little farther east ward. The houses which were afterwards removed by the Government for the purpose of forming Beresford Square are also very clearly defined. The Royal Arsenal. \u2014 The Arsenal consisted of the Laboratory, Dial and Carriage Squares, with the old Gun Foundry, the Academy, and the Artillery Barracks, Rupert's Walk, and the remains of the old moat. The practice-butt is also seen, and there are evidences of a gravel pit, relic of the waste which the Warren once was. The circles probably represent ornamental basins or fountains, excepting the small one near the Academy (7) which stands for Rupert's Tower. The gate of the Arsenal was considerably recessed ; it was about fifty yards west of its present position and very narrow. The Ropey ard occupied the site of Beresford Street, and the origin of Ropeyard Rails is self-evident. We have seen that Cannon Row (e) was called Ragged Row, and the Arsenal was apparently walled in, as it is now, but there seems to have been a second entrance by the back way from Warren Lane. The Market and High Street. \u2014 One of the strangest revelations due to this plan is the discovery that the old Market HouseJ stood at (i) * Chobck : ch pronounced hard as k ; sometimes spelt \" Collick.\" + See Hypothetical View, next title-page.

The open ground now known as the Market Head, in High Street, was then all built over with houses, and a new market house (r) had been erected in a square on the river side of it ; while the wharf beyond, from which the steamboats now start was (y) a woodyard. New Street (q) was New Street then, having too long outlived its name; hut the market-place was then below, not above it. On tho other side of Bell* Watergate (s) was (x) Rem nant's! private foundry of shot and shell (where now is Edgar's coal wharf), and this will probably explain the error into which other old histriographers have fallen in stating that the Gunwharf at Woolwich formerly stood on the site of the market-place. J Meeting House Lane (m) to-day perpetuates the existence of the early Nonconformists' chapel ; \u00a7 and we have heard traditions of (l) the Old Orchard and (n) Caribbee Isles, which were on the site of Rodney Street and the Baths, but survived in name only, even in 1748. The small building w*hich stands in the centre of High Street is pro bably the parish pump, and we may suppose that the small circles at Warren Lane and other places represent wells. It will be observed that the triangular projection just above R exactly corresponds with the shape of the present paved market-place, and the little alley across it exists to-day in the shape of a narrow road. Water Stairs and Alleys. \u2014 The landing-place which we call Ship Stairs was then \" Sheep Stairs,\" and another landing, known as the \" Blue Anchor Stairs,\" was at the bottom of Globe Lane. There was a \" Cock Yard,\" as now, on the opposite side of High Street, and a \"Cow Yard \" on the Market Hill. Cow Yard (i) has lost all trace of its inelegant title, unless we can follow its development in its present name of Gough Yard. Here we may see in embryo the lanes and * The Bell Tavern at Woolwich is mentioned in a State Paper relating to a theft of cordage belonging to the State (Commonw-ealth), dated Jan. 18th, 1655. t The following epitaph on \" Stephen Remnant, Esq., of Woolwich,\" I have seen quoted as a Uterary curiosity \u2014 \" Here's a Remnant of life and a Remnant of death, Taken at once in a Remnant of breath ; To mortality this gives a happy release, For what was the Remnant is now the whole piece. % In Lysons' \" Environs of London,\" published in 1796, it is said that \" the Gun wharf at Woolwich is a very ancient place and formerly occupied the site of the market place in High Street.\" There is no authority for this belief other than Lysons, who made the statement \"on the information of John Coekburn, Esq., Storekeeper of the Warren.\" The supposition is contrary to all the teachings of the official records, and probably arose from a confused tradition relating to Mr. Remnant's shot and shell foundry, which stood at this spot. \u00a7 See Records of Nonconformity."], [128, "RECOBDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 44 orchards which ultimately became built about, but still bear the name of \" The Gardens.\" The alleys all converge upon a footpath which led from Cock Yard (//) to the upper part of Green's End and thence to the Common. Hare Street, which now takes a similar direction, had not yet been thought off, and was, in fact, not a thoroughfare for nearly a hundred years after Barker's plan was drawn. Old West Woolwich. \u2014 We commence our inspection of the second half of Barker's plan where it should join the first. The contemptuous nomenclature of the old alleys observed in the east pursues us in the west. There is Hog Lane (u), which we have recently refined into Nile Street ; * there is the sister Sow Alley (v), and a little Pio- Court (w). Glass Yard (x), in which at this time the Huguenot glassblowers probably worked, and Short's Alley (y), still hold fast to their ancient titles, but some of the other courts have disappeared. The Parsonage. \u2014 At the western end of Short's Alley (y), and under the reference e\\ will be seen a house standing in an extensive o-arden. This was the old parsonage, which had on one hand High Street and Parson's Hill, and on the other side the Thames, into which at some remoter day its green lawn dipped. Such a dwelling as Swift had in his mind when he said \u2014 I've often wished that I had clear For life six hundred pounds a year, A handsome house to lodge a friend A river at my garden's end. Our fathers have told us of this rectory as it stood at the foot of Parson's Hill early in the present century, and both in the plan and in Buck's view (Plate IV., pages 4-5) it is distinctly seen. It faced the river, having its back on High Street, and was approached on both sides through an avenue of trees, now a mere alley entering by the gas works, and emerging at the soup-kitchen, but even now spoken of as \" The Grove.\" Prince Rupert. \u2014 Tradition has it that this house was the residence of Prince Rupert when he was constructing the defences of Woolwich and fighting for the Stuarts, and that the various \" yards \" in the vicinity bearing the names of animals were so many appurtenances of his establishment \u2014 \" Dog Yard \" being the kennel, and \" Hog Lane \" the piggery, and so on. There is, however, no evidence to support the assumption, and the probabilities are against it.f * The \" Green Dragon \" tavern at the bottom was re-christcned \" The Nile \" in honour of Nelson's victory. It was demolished in 1887 for the Steam Ferry. + See Prince Rupert at the Royal Arsenal."], [129, "45 WOOLWICH. Sir Martin Bowes. \u2014 I find, however, that there was in earlier times a second, and probably more important, mansion at this spot, the exact site of which I should fix at the bottom of Glass Yard. If Rupert resided in this vicinity it is likely that he may have occupied this latter house, where I am of opinion that another distinguished man, of more consequence to Woolwich than even Prince Rupert, had his home. This was Sir Martin Bowes, who is described by old Stow as \" a great and worthy citizen, Lord Mayor of London, and a benefactor of the first size.\" He was of the Company of Goldsmiths, and endowed the Goldsmiths' Almshouses in Cannon Row, one of the most valuable of the Woolwich charities. He flourished in the reigns of Henry VIII. and Edward VI., and died on the 4th of August, 1566.* The remains of a large dilapidated house in Cock Yard were recently exposed during the progress of the Hare Street improvement, and it was hinted that this was believed to have been the house of Sir Martin Bowes ; but I have reason to think that his residence was by the river side and nearer the Dockyard. In 1541, Henry VIII. granted to Sir Martin Bowes a dwelling house, with a garden and wharf belonging to it, in Woolwich. f This property Sir Martin leased or sold for a time, but in after years regained and bequeathed to his family, and this, until there is proof to the contrary, I can only identify with the mansion in \" The Grove.\" The old parsonage was pulled down in 1809, when the present Eectory was built on the Glebe. I have ventured to suppose that this locality north of High Street may have been part of the manor of \" Jefferys.\"J The Church Hill. \u2014 The approaches on either side of the church yard (c1 and c2) were both known as Church Hill, as indeed they were until lately. Edward Street or Parson's Hill, either of which may now represent e1, was then continued by a footpath going in the direc tion of the Common, still traceable in an alley leading out of Parson's Hill by the forge. The Church. \u2014 The church in Barker's plan was the present structure, then newly built, and the old edifice, which we have seen as it stood in 1739 (plate iv.), had been swept away. The footpath * More of Sir Martin Bowes (with portrait) hereafter. Stow describes Sir Martin's tomb in the church of St. Mary Wolnoth as being \" of goodly marble, under the communion table, where his will is also kept.\" Sir Martin Bowes was four times Lord Mavor of London. t Page 16. t The estate of Jefferys consisted of 540 acres. All, or nearly all, the remaining area of the parish was in the estate of Southall (see \" Manor Rolls \"). The premises ol Sir Martin Bowes are described in the Chancery records as having consisted of a capital messuage, orchard, and wharf, and 2i acres, near the Kingstield (probably east of the Dockyard) in Woolwich, late belonging to the Monastery of St. Mary Overy Southwark. n"], [130, "46 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. through the churchyard was not railed off until about 1848. The addition to the south side of the burial-ground was made in 1801. On the western side of the churchyard we see the orchard which suggested our Orchard Street, and we may peradventure recognise some of the surviving houses on the side of Church Hill. The old Dockyard Gates. \u2014 At e2 we come upon another revela tion. There is a footpath and flight of steps descending abruptly to the Dockyard wall, in which, at the protuberance which I have always believed marks the diversion of the ancient highway,* there are evidences of an entrance. This induced me to examine more closely the model of the Dockyard in the Repository, and, having had it brought into the light, I found the gates, a sketch of which I made on the spot. Probably no one living was aware that the Dockyard gates were ever in this position. Hill's Alley (d), just facing the old gates, is now Sun Street. The object to the left of the letter probably represents a public well. New Alley (c) is now known as Martyr's Pass age, but the cottages called Doudie's Carribees (b) are A*an ished and forgotten. The site Woolwich Dockyard Gates at Church Hill, 1748. is now occupied by the Globe and Sheer Hulk taverns, The Dockyard extended no farther than this point in 1748 ; and on the west we see \" the Sand Quay,\" at which the sand brought from Bowater's pits ('*) was shipped. The road from the pits, which is now Chapel Street, ran straight to the river through an orchard. Henry Street and Frances Street had not been formed, and Mr. Bo water's house and garden, as before stated, stood on the sand cliff. The larger of the two buildings seen on the plan (q) was the mansion, the smaller the stabling and farmhouse. The Church Footpath. \u2014 We may learn that in Barker's time the only communication between the Dockyard and the Common, other than by toiling through a sandpit or going a long way round, was the footpath across the fields from the church, which footpath followed in its upper part the present line of Rectory Place and Mulgrave Place. * The road which runs through the Dockyard is a direct continuation of the original highway, which seems to have been diverted to the south, being probably pushed out to form Church Street in the early growth of the Dockyard."], [131, "ble in this copy : \u2014 t, Royal Anne, first-rate, building. u, Forty-Gun Ship repairing. w, The Hulk. x, Seat of \u2014 Bowater, Esq. y, Parish Church. z, Shooters' Hill, [To face paje 46.] PLATE VIII.

Showing the Stairs and Scmd Quay. and the accompanying views we may construct a fairly satisfactory idea of Woolwich as it existed a hundred and fifty years since, and realise with more or less accuracy the circumstances under which our fore fathers lived in the older days, and during some of the events embraced within the records. I light, for instance, on this singular incident, the actors in which could scarcely have expected that it would be preserved and brought to light five generations after : \u2014 \u25a0 March 24th, 1760. \u2014 \"Whereas the mill built by the shipwrights belonging to His Majesty's Dockyard at Woolwich was on Sunday the 16th of this instant, consumed by tire ; and it having been scandalously and maliciously reported that the bakers belonging to the said Town were concerned in setting the same on fire ; therefore we, Thomas Fleet, John Hodgkinson, Thomas Asslott, George Sargent, George Moore, and Robert Shewring, all of Woolwich in the County of Kent, Bakers, do severally make oath and say that they neither knew nor heard of the same in flames, and that they nor any of them did not set the same on fire, or were in any manner whatever accessory to the said accident.

We may therefore at least surmise that this old mill, of which I have a very artistic engraving drawn by Mr. W. Clifton (plate xvi.), was the mill built by the shipwrights. The Market House. \u2014 But, as already observed, one of the most remarkable discoveries which are due to Barker's plan is the Market House, which stood at the end of Ropeyard Rails, where we now find St. Saviour's schools. This spot, which was for centuries in the best part of the High Street, and the heart of the little town, was in our time {i.e. 1849) occupied by the parish cage. The cage, which was removed shortly afterwards, bore the date of 1812. A similar structure preceded it, and we may safely infer, now that we know the Market House was there, that the cage and stocks were there also.* Who would have thought that just a hundred years before we saw the cage pulled down an old market toll-house was at the point of death on the selfsame spot ? So far as we are able to judge from the plan (i) the structure was of the kind still to be found existing in antiquated towns, its principal use being probably that of an office for collecting the market tolls from the dealers who occupied the surrounding space. A New Market. \u2014 The market itself appears, however, to have, in Barker's time, recently removed to the newer market place, just described as on the site of Ross's wharf. This, the second market place, was not open to High Street, as the market-place known to us has been for the last two or three generations. It was a quad rangle enclosed by buildings with narrow entrances from High Street and New Street. There was a squire market house in the centre of this, the second market, and the buildings round were probably butchers' shambles and shops, for I am told that there were some underground ruins hereabout, in which the boys were wont to play sixty years ago. The accompanying sketch, made near this spot about 1835, would have shown a portion of these remains if they had then existed, but they had disappeared. The tent-like erection in the centre of the picture was, I believe, a shelter over the parish pump, which stood here in 1835, and is shown also in Barker's plan of eighty-six years earlier. Another new Market.\u2014 The date of another market-place is fixed hy a note in the supplement to Lysons' Environs (1811), which says \u2014 Under an Act of Parliament passed in 1807, Woolwich has now two market days, * In 1664 there was a report made to the Admiralty hy the Master Shipwright, Chris. Pett, of the arrest ot the servant to the carpenter of the vacht Henrietta for stealing old iron. He says : \" We put him in the stocks, when he confessed that he sold it to a smith in the town. He was then taken from the stocks aud whipped and discharged from the Dockyard.\" The stocks and not the cage are here mentioned, but in 1798 the cage was reported to be on the site of the market house (see page 57)."], [135, "PLATE IX.

The market-place is about to be removed under the above mentioned Act, and a new site has beea prepared. * It was stated in this Act that the old market-place (the \" new market place \" of Barker's plan) had fallen into disuse for want of proper accommodation, and that it would be of great utility to have a suitable market-house erected (which it never was). The condemned place was described as \"the market, shambles, buildings, and erections thereto attached,\" all until that time private property. The buildings attached to the market included the Crown and Cushion public - house (John Kibble), the Waterman's Arms (John Bull), the wharf house and market (John Strother), the King's Head public -house (John Prebble), four shops and fourteen private houses, the whole belonging to Lady Wilson. On its site now stand Ross's Wharf House and the shops on the north side of Market Head. The Act of 1807 was, however, a futile measure. It was deemed inexplicit, and an Act of the following session (48 Geo. III.) was passed to set it right. The petition which forms the preamble of this Act will explain the difficulty : \u2014 Whereas an Act was passed in the Forty-seventh year of His present Majesty, intituled, \" An act for paving, cleaning, lighting, and watching the Town and Pariah of Woolwich, in the County of Kent, and removing and preventing nuisances therein ; for the better relief and employment of the poor ; for providing an additional Burial Ground ; and for regulating the Market of the said Town and Parish,\" and whereas doubts have arisen whether, under the Provisions of the said Act, the Commissioners thereby appointed can purchase ground and erect a Market House and Shambles thereon, without previously purchasing the present Market, Shambles, and Erections attached thereto ; May it therefore please your Majesty, and be it enacted in this present Parliament, that it may be lawful for the said Commissioners to contract and agree with any Person or Persons whomsoever for the Purchase of a Piece of Ground within the said Town, not exceeding one acre and a half, or to take and accept a Lease thereof for any Term not being less than eighty years, at a full or nominal Ground Rent for the same, and to erect a Market House, Shambles, and other necessary buildings thereon, as the said Commissioners shall think proper, without previously purchasing the present Market House, Shambles, and Erections attached thereto. Under this Act it appears the Town Commissioners purchased the ground upon which the Town Hall and police offices stand, and endeavoured to establish a market. But they had reckoned without their public, and, although they put up their shambles, and made all the other necessary preparations, they could not get the people to go so far \" out of the town \" to do their marketing. They still clung to the Market Head in High Street, and after a while the attempted transporta tion of the mart was abandoned as hopeless, all that reminds us of it * The site upon which the Town Hall, &c, now stands."], [138, "50 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. now being the \" Market Streets \" which surround the scene of the failure. Market Hill. \u2014 Some alteration and improvement of the Market Head were, however, effected by the Wilson family, to whom the site and the market rights belonged ; and the present space, having been ultimately cleared of the old buildings upon it, was used instead of the spot nearer the river. Migration of the Market. \u2014 And so it continued and flourished until that era of changes, the time of the Crimean War, 1854-5, when the population shifted eastward, and the dealers followed, leading an unsettled life about the streets, at constant war with the authorities, until they were allowed to congregate in Beresford Square. The Market Charter. \u2014 Woolwich Market, through all its vicissi tudes, has lasted for two hundred and seventy years. It exists by virtue of an ancient charter which reads like a vestige of feudal law. It was King James I. who issued letters patent, bearing date the First day of June, in the Sixteenth year of His Reign (1619), granting \"by the request and for the benefit of the inhabitants\" \u2014 To Sir IVilliam Barne* Knight, and Hugh Lyddiard, t Esquire, and their Heirs and Assigns for ever, the right to hold and keep, within the town of IVoolwich, and the Liberties and Precincts of the same, one Market Day on Friday in every Week, yearly to be holden and Kept ; and also two Fairs or Marts yearly, one on the First* Day of June, and the other on the Feast Day of Saint Simon and Saint Jude, together with the incident separate Pie-powder Courts, for the Time of the said Fairs or Marts respectively to be held, and with all Liberties and free Customs, Tollage, Stallage, Piccage, Fines, Amerciaments, and all other profits for their own use and benefit. Tolls for Two Hundred and Fifty Years. \u2014 And thenceforward, for their own use and benefit, Barnes and Lyddiard, their heirs and successors, took the market tolls for two hundred and fifty years. Lady Wilson and Sir Thomas Wilson, to whom the privilege descended with the freehold of the adjacent property, always had their agents out Su* William Barne (or Barnes) was knighted in 1603. Lysons says : \"A family of good account, called Barnes, sometimes Barne, settled in Woolwich in Elizabeths reign. In 1596 Sir William Barnes was a justice of the peace\u2014 a time, Mr. Lambarde says, when only persons of the highest reputation and the best gentrv being in the Commission, it was an honour to everyone who was named on it.\" the son of the Sir William here mentioned was Lord Mayor of London, and among his descend ants was Sir William Lovelace, father of the cavalier poet, Richard Lovelace, who was born at Woolwich.

The Act of 1808, however, expressly pre served and perpetuated the manorial rights, and subject to this proviso it was enacted \u2014 That such market shall be holden on the AVednesday and Saturday in each and every week,* Christmas Days and Fast Days by proclamation excepted. But, whatever the local authorities did, the lord of the manor was still paramount. When the Commissioners established (or attempted to establish) the market on the site of the Town Hall and police court, the agents of Sir Thomas Wilson were allowed to walk in and collect the tolls, just as they always did when the market was in High Street. However, as just observed, the profits of the market tolls diminished as the dealers migrated eastward, and they had become a minus quantity when, in 1868, the Local Board leased them for twenty-one years of Sir Thomas Maryon Wilson for a nominal sum, and attempted to lure back the trade to High Street. The old spot was paved and lighted and otherwise improved, but the market had gone for ever. The town had changed its centre owing to the extension ofthe Arsenal and the growth of Plumstead, and the dealers followed the people. Beresford Square. \u2014 In defiance of all efforts to check it, a vigorous market soon grew up in Beresford Square. For many years the local authorities feigned to ignore it, or tried to crush it, but it continued to flourish in a free and lawless manner, whilst the ancient market-place became utterly deserted. About 1884 the Local Board began with hesitation to recognise and acknowledge the inevitable by putting \"the Square\" under some sanitary supervision, and in 1887 Sir Spencer Maryon Wilson sold all his rightsf in the matter to the parish for the sum of \u00a3500. In 1888 the Local Board made regulations for this Beresford Square Market, and, in order to extend it, cleared away a plantation of trees and shrubs which had been formed on the western side 6ome twenty years before. The One Long Street. \u2014 Returning now to Barker's plan, we may observe that it is confirmed by another plan of the Dockyard drawn by a later hand, in 1753, and preserved in the same volume of the King's Library. From these two maps together we learn that the north-western side of Church Hill was all a hillock of open ground crossed by footpaths. There was then no entrance to the churchyard * An Act was passed in 1847 by which such markets are permitted to be held on such other days as the local authorities may appoint. t The market rights extend to the whole of the parish."], [140, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 52 on the Bide next Parson's Hill ; the churchyard did not extend so far; and there was no Parson's Hill, no St. Mary Street, Orchard Street, Coleman Street, Warwick Street, Chapel Street, Queen Street, Henry Street nor Frances Street. The few narrow openings, like Sun Alley, Martyr's Passage, and Bowling Green Row, led from Church Street, to fields gardens, and solitary cottages, and virtually the whole of Woolwich, save the one long street, was in the hands of the hus- bandman. Views Of Old Woolwich.\u2014 The picture of Old Woolwich which appears as a frontispiece was drawn by T. Girtin and published in 1798. Another similar view, of which I now present a copy, is of unknown date, but it is probably earlier than Girtin's work. The two, however, fairly correspond, and both appear to be taken from precisely the same spot. This posi tion I have endeavoured to trace, but I have long been uncertain. Neither Rectory Place nor Frances Street would fit the situation, but I have learnt that a farm lane, now extinct, passed from the church to and beyond Bowater House, over which lane the public had a semi right of way which was continued for some time after the Marine Map of Dockyard, District, 1832. Barracks were rebuilt. The present back-way to these (the Cambridge) barracks from King Street went completely through the barracks fifty years ago, and there is a remnant of this road which we can still trace in the greensward up to the rear of the Red Barracks and the site of the old Manor House. The road is shown by the (j^ in the plan here given, which is copied from a map of the Borough drawn at its formation in 1832, and I have no doubt that it was from the highest point of this road, just at the back of the Red Barracks, that our artists sketched Old Woolwich. The Pleasant Little Town. \u2014 Here then we are brought face to face with the rural Woolwich of a hundred years ago, and stand in a country lane between hedges and in the midst of fields, where now bricks and mortar cover the ground in all directions. Within a tract of perhaps a mile in each direction, we see only one or two home steads, a row of cottages behind the Church, and the roofs of a few"], [141, "Old Woolwich.\u2014 A Sketch of the Last Century. [To face page 32, PLATE X."], [142, ""], [143, "WOOLWICH. 53 houses at Church Hill. The rest of the town is hidden by the rising ground. The house on the hill to the right stood near the site of the Congre gational Church in Rectory Place. The one below may have been the predecessor of \" Grove House \" in Rectory Grove. The letterpress description which appears under the original of Girtin's picture (our frontispiece) in the Kent Itinerant is worth quoting : \u2014 Woolwich. \u2014 This pleasant little town is most delightfully situated on the southern bank of the Thames. It is remarkable that part of the parish is on the opposite side of the Thames, on the Essex shore, and where formerly there was a chapel, though included in the county of Kent. The town is not only rendered considerable by its excellent Dockyard, the oldest belonging to the Royal Navy, and which is reported to have furnished as many men-of-war as any two in the kingdom, but it is also deservedly famous as our British university for the military science, where young gentlemen are regularly instructed in all the arts of gunnery and fortification. It is indeed the usual residence of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, who have an aeademy for instructing the train in the art of gunnery, and a company of matrosses are commonly employed in making up cartridges, and charging bombs, carcases, and grenadoes. In the Warren or Park, where trial is made of great guns and mortars, there are some thousand pieces of ordnance, with a prodigious number of shot and shells. The town has a market every Friday, but no fair, and there is an almshouse for poor widows. The famous Mr. Duncan Campbell* has also assisted the celebrity, if not the reputation, of this place, by stationing his academy of convicted felons in lighters off the town of Woolwich, for the purpose of heaving ballast from the bed of the river. \"Woolwich a \"Watering-place.\" \u2014 The resident of Woolwich to-day will be gratified to note in the foregoing description the character Woolwich from Sandy Hill, 1836. of the \"pleasant little town\" as it existed in the past century. But even more recently it has received similar compliments from equally disinterested observers. It is classed as one of the \" Watering-places Mr. Campbell had charge of the convict hulks."], [144, "54 RECORDS OF THE AV00LWICH DISTRICT. of Great Britain \" * in a work of that name, published in 1S36, and the view from Sandy Hill is here reproduced from an engraving which appears therein. Furthermore, we have evidence to the same effect in \" Cock's Guide \" of 1837, which says \u2014 The short distance from the Metropolis, the facilities afforded by steamboat conveyance, &c, together with the salubriousness and gentility of the higher parts of the town, form a powerful incitement for some of the London merchants to make Woolwich their place of abode. A Youthful Elopement.- \u2014 -But we have not yet done with the eighteenth century, respecting which we glean some interesting extracts from the Showell Collection,')' a series of scrap-books filled with pictures and newspaper cuttings, to which we are indebted for many records. Amongst them we find the following, which was printed about the year 1770 \u2014 Taken away by violence from her friends at Woolwich, by breaking open the locks of her chamber and parlour doors, and forcing her out of a window, Mart Baker : she is not 15 years old, has a speck in each eye, dressed in an old linen bedgown, with no stays on, a light-coloured quilted petticoat, and a red cloak, under the pretence of an arrest for a debt, by John Davis . . . And supposed to be concealed by John Spencer, about 13 years old, son-in-law of the said John Davis. This is to caution all persons not to secrete or harbour the said Mary Baker, all clergymen are desired not to marry them, and all inn-keepers and stable-keepers are not to furnish such persons with post-chaises or carriages. Whoever will bring the young Lady unmarried to Cuthbert Andrews at his Majesty's Rope Yard at Woolwich will receive '2' i guineas reward. Under 1769 we read \u2014 Yesterday morning was married at Woolwich George Bond, Esquire, to Miss Norris jf Woolwich, an agreeable young Lady with a genteel Fortune. These scrap-books will have to be frequently referred to Pies and Puddings. \u2014 The rolls of the Royal Military Academy will also have to be quoted freely, and will be found amusing. The following is one extract : \u2014 Jan. 1795. \u2014 The inhabitants of Woolwich having signed an agreement to leave off pastry during the high price of hour, the Governor of the Academy dispenses with the usual pies and puddings, but recommends the housekeeper to provide rice puddings at the Cadets' table every Tuesday.

A great many Aldermen were present, and this being Mr. AVilkes's first appearance at Woolwich since an Alderman, a number of people assembled to see him. The Old Volunteers. \u2014 If it be only to introduce two other persons connected with our history, I may refer to the fact that our locality was loyal according to its ability in the volunteer movement of the last century. At an entertainment given by Lord Romney* to the county volunteers at his lordship's seat near Maidstone, in the presence of King George III. and the Royral Family, on the lst of August, 1799, there were mustered 5,319 officers and men, among whom are mentioned \u2014 From Woolwich, Captain Remnant* and 21 cavalry, Captain Powis and 06 cavalry. From Greenwich, Captain Cooke and 32 cavalry, Captain Campbell and 129 cavalry. From Deptford, Captain Goodhew and 41 cavalry, Captain Lamb and 53 cavalry. The Loyal Greenwich Water Fencibles, under Captain Colegate, with a roll of 192, did not attend the Review. Woolwich contributed some years later a troop to the \" Blaekheath Volunteer Cavalry,\" referred to in the Records of the Garrison. * The name of Remnant we have already seen. This officer was doubtless a member of the family which formerly had the shot foundry at Bell AVatergate.

Improved and Beautified. \u2014 Being an ancient town, grown up before building acts, street regulations, and sanitary science were thought of, Woolwich is an inheritance which has vexed the souls of several generations of its modern inhabitants, and has left much to be done for its narrow and crooked ways, its houses and its people, before it can hope to vie in health and comfort and respectability with its younger neighbours. Nevertheless, it is certain that the town has been consider ably reformed, and, at least for eighty years, the principal work of its local government has been the effort to repair the errors of the past. We read, indeed, in a gazette of the eighteenth century, that as early as 1750 the town had \" recently been much improved and beautified,\" which probably refers to the market buildings at that time newly erected in High Street. Until then the town had apparently vegetated from its very beginning, without any idea of advancement beyond the market"], [147, "Green's End, Woolwich, about 17'.l(). The Original Drawing from which I have taken this interesting picture of Green's End is in manuscript, and bears neither date nor name of the artist. It is, however, probably the work of Paul Sandby, and the collection of which it forms part is supposed to have been made in 1786. The point of observation is marked at the present day by the corner of Lower Market Street, and the house in the centre of the middle-distance is the former Duchess of Wellington Tavern, now the Green's End Distillery, which may then have been a private residence or school. The building seen above the roof to the right might stand for the Chapel erected by the Wesleyans, afterwards the Roman Catholic Church, and now the Steam Flour-Mills, but cannot be reconciled with the date assigned as the Chapel was not built until 1789. The probability is that the sketch is of about the year 1790.

Here was the seat of government, here was the rendezvous of the old watchmen and constables ; * and here the ale-tasters, beadles, and highway surveyors held court and sway. And, notwithstanding the erection in 1748 of the new \" market and shambles \" farther west, the old Market House did not desert its ground until 1774, when, being utterly condemned as a nuisance, it was pulled down. The Centre of Government. \u2014 The parishioners did not rebuild their market house, though it seems to have stood upon a parish free hold, for we are told in the charity records that \u2014 In 1687 Sir Richard Pritchard gave the old maiket-place, where the cage now is, for the benefit of the poor. \u2014 Table of Benefactions, 179S. It should be noted, however, that Sir Richard Pritchard gave the site for the almshouses, and there may be some confusion here. There is no doubt that the market house was timber-built, and dilapidated before it had seen very many years. There is the following entry in the Vestry books of \u2014 March, 1735. \u2014 Resolved to pull down the cage, watch-house, and stocks, and rebuild as before on the same ground. This intention was not performed. The building, as just stated, was not demolished until 1774, and then a watch-house, cage, and stocks were undoubtedly built upon the site. This edifice would scarcely be dignified with the character which attaches to the centre of govern ment, and we may therefore assume that from 1737 until 1840, when the Town Hull was built \u2014 that is, for more than a hundred years \u2014 Woolwich had no recognised seat of authority ; justice and other local requirements being administered at some schoolroom or public tavern. Even the watch-house built in 1774 did not endure until our time. It had to be rebuilt in 1812. The Stocks. \u2014 The stocks, too, had altogether disappeared in 1849, but many of the inhabitants remember them. The last reference I find to their employment as a punishment is dated October 30, 1835 : \u2014 A man named Castleton appeared in a state of intoxication to give evidence before the magistrates, who, instantly perceiving, refused to hear his evidence and fined him five shillings for being drunk. He refused to pay, and Dr. Watson sentenced him to six hours in the stocks. * The frequent mention of these constables in the parochial and manorial papers tempts a quotation from Bishop Earl : \" A constable is a viceroy in the street, and no man stands more upon't that lie is lhe king's officer. His jurisdiction extends to the next stocks, where he has commission tor the heels only, and sets the rest of the body at liberty. He is a scarecrow to that alehouse where he drinks not his morn ing draught, and apprehends a drunkard for not standing in the king's name. Beggars fear him more than the justice, and as much as the whipstock, whom he delivers over to his subordinate magistrates, the bridewell man and the beadle.\""], [150, "58 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT.

Five Markets. \u2014 Taking the site of the cage as the first market place, we have regarded as the \" second market \" that which we see in Barker's plan, encroaching upon our \" Ross's wharf.\" In 1807, when an attempt was made to establish a third market on the Town Hall site, the second market was described as ruinous, and \" all fallen into disuse for want of proper accommodation,\" and such it remained for a good many years, as it is shown in the same position both in a map oi the Ordnance property drawn in 1810, and in a private plan of the Bow ater Estate prepared in 1820. At the latter date, as I am told by aged"], [151, "WOOLWICH. 59 people, only the basement of the shambles remained, and these were cleared away to the foundations when the fourth market was laid out close by on Market Hill. Beresford Square is consequently the fifth Woolwich market. The old Draughtsmen. \u2014 We have seen how much of the information and interest afforded by these records is ascribable to the old prints which illustrate the text. These, it will be noticed, are chiefly attributable to the latter half of the eighteenth century, when the art of engraving underwent a great advancement, and public taste and desire for landscape drawings experienced a high development. It is fortunate for us that the period corresponds with the lifetime of a generation which must always have an important place in our local his tory, and that the occasion produced such able draughtsmen as Buck, Barker, Milton, Girtin, Sandby and others, who have left us the heritage of their admirable workmanship for our edification and enjoyment. Paul Sandby. \u2014 Paul Sandby, of whom we have an excellent portrait at the head of this chapter, resided at Woolwich during the greater part of his life, and was a most able, industrious, and popular artist, who found ample employment for his talent, not only in fancy etchings and fugitive sketches, but also in taking views of country seats and illustrating magazines. He is said to have amassed a large fortune, and the hundreds of old prints upon which we find his name confirm the belief. He was chief drawing master at the Royal Military Academy from August, 1768, to January, 1797. Agricultural Woolwich. \u2014 The rural and picturesque aspect of the town, as presented to us by our artists, endured for some time after the close of the last century. Lysons in the first edition of his \" Environs of London \" (1792-5) wrote \u2014 There are in Woolwich, on the Kentish side of the river, fifty acres of marsh, about forty acres arable, and ten occupied by a market gardener. Some of this agricultural space is now within the Dockyard ; the remainder is built upon. Mr. Samuel Hardin farmed nearly the whole of it, and at his death in 1803 was succeeded by his son-in-law, Mr. John Shersby. Mr. Hardin's farmhouse and residence stood on the ground now occupied by the large building at the Dockyard gates. formerly the quarters of the Commodore Superintendent, since in the occupation of the Commissariat and Transport staff, and now converted into offices. I have seen in the British Museum an unfinished sketch made on this spot showing \" The Ruins of Mr. Hardin's Farm, Woolwich, inhabited by an old couple, who claim the right to it. \u2014 Nov. 12, 1807.\" Shersby' S Field. \u2014 The whole of the triangle enclosed by Albion"], [152, "60 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT.

It is hastily sketched on a scrap of paper, and was probably penned in court during the progress of a law suit to illustrate the locus in quo. The late Mr. S. C.

But the inroads of the Dockyard having once broken through, other ravages followed. Thc Powis Estate was sold to Mr. Ogilby for \u00a35,000, and another slice to Mr. Shersby for \u00a3500. Both were promptly laid out for building, and the Board of Commissioners were wise in securing the plot which, after failing with their projected market, they turned to account as sites for the present Police Offices and Town Hall.

The same year Sanger's circus, which usually occupied the ground behind the Barrack Tavern, wintered on the spot now covered by the Union Street Board Schools. In earlier years, prior to 1848, when space was plentiful, the travelling companies had more choice, and dropped down in the vicinity of Brewer Street, or elsewhere, as they might list. Only once in my remembrance has a show or circus stood on Woolwich Common, and that was in 1885, when Sanger's great tent was seen near the Camp. Sermons in Stones. \u2014 Referring to Beresford Square, we are reminded that the stones which form the paved crossing from the Elephant and Castle to the Mortar Tavern have historic associations with Whitehall and Charing Cross, for in 1884 they were taken up from the space in front of Trafalgar Square, where they had for fifty years or more been trodden by all sorts and conditions of men. Though partly worn, they were still suitable for the lighter traffic of Woolwich, and at this and other parts of the town they were advan tageously put to their second use. The First Commissioners. \u2014 The Improvement Act of 1807, recently mentioned, was a well-intended measure. It originated in a strenuous desire to do something for the town and its inhabitants, but the effort appears to have proved too much for its authors, and to have fallen exhausted from lack of stamina. By this enactment Parliament gave sanction for enlarging or rebuilding the old workhouse in Bope Yard Rails, providing a cemetery, re-erecting the market house, and so on, and appointed the following commissioners to carry out these necessary and important works : \u2014 The Rector and churchwardens, Lieut.-Gen. Vaughan Lloyd, Edward Syson, John Tyson, Benjamin Wilmot, Dr. John Rollo, Robinson Kittoe, John Guest, Thomas Fitzmaurice, William Sture, Joseph Meads Madkins, Col. Wm. Borthwick, Capt. Geo. Hayter, John Rutter, Thomas Burnett, Joseph Whidby, Dr. Wm. Witman, Adjutant Ernest, Christian Wilford, Wm. Absalom, John Bonnycastle, Richard Dunmail, jun., Wm. Austin, John Henderson, Rev. Johu Bbgh, James Stone, Capt. Henry Deacon, Capt. Tremenare, John Long, Thomas Percival, Thomas Foster, and Thomas Mills. The Water Supply. \u2014 The Commissioners were to meet in a room at the poor house and in the Sunday-school room which stood in the churchyard, and they did meet accordingly, but they did not rebuild the workhouse nor the market house, and they did not create a new cemetery. They purchased, however, some additional land to enlarge the churchyard, and set about providing a water supply, having been rightly persuaded that the first condition of health was pure water. The Thames, though clean, was so impregnated with salt as to be unfit for domestic use, and very little to be preferred was the system of"], [161, "PLATE XII.

By the second local act (1808) the Commissioners were empowered \u2014 To raise and convey water from a Field in the Parish of Charlton belonging to Dame Jane Wilson and Sir Thomas Maryon Wilson, Baronet, along the high road leading from Greenwich to Woolwich, into the Town of Woolwich, and along the High Road by Unity Place into Frances Street, and from thence into a Reservoir to be made in a field belonging to John Bowater, Esquire, in the occupation of Mary Rideout, Widow,* and afterwards through Lands belonging to the Rector of the said Parish of Woolwich into another Reservoir near Woolwich Church, in a field in the Occupation of Mr. Samuel Hardin. The source from whence the water was to be obtained was a spring t beside the Woolwich Lower Road by the turnpike at Charlton Lane, where the Kent Water Company fifty years afterwards erected one of their pumps. The Commissioners went to the expense of \u00a33,600 in buying the spring and providing machinery, but they were unable to complete the work, and were glad to accept from the Kent Water Com pany of Deptford an offer to take the whole responsibility off their hands. The Company bought the machinery for about \u00a31,000, but found it unsuitable and resold it at a sacrifice. The)' also complied with the terms of the local act by making a reservoir known as the Bowater Pond, on the land of Mrs. Rideout, but the proposal to form another reservoir on the Rector's glebe land near the church was very wisely discarded. A rather extensive reservoir was discovered a few years ago under some stabling near Pickford's yard at the back of High Street, but there is no mention of this in any of the documents relating to the Water works that have come under my notice. * Widow of Capt.

CHAPTER VI. EDUCATION New Commissioners. \u2014 An energetic move onward was made in 1834, when a new generation arose and re-established the govern ing body of the town on a fresh basis. We find under date of \u2014 May 1th, 1834. \u2014 The first meeting of the Commissioners of the town and parish of Woolwich was held in the schoolroom on the evening of Thursday last, the Rev. H. Fraser, Rector, in the chair, when the following appointments were made : William Nokes, Esq. solicitor and treasurer ; Mr. Edward Sargent, clerk ; Messrs. Charles Sargent and Samuel Watts, collectors of the parochial rates. We thus come within touch of the present generation, for these officials were all serving within the last forty years. Mr. Edward Sargent, besides being clerk to the commissioners, was in 1835 elected actuary to the Woolwich and Plumstead Savings' Bank, \"vice the convict Gloag,\" and became the first clerk ofthe Local Board of Health when it was constituted in 1852, Mr. Nokes aforesaid being also retained as its solicitor."], [165, "WOOLWICH. 69 Men of 1837. \u2014 The following were the parochial appointments in Woolwich on the lst April, 1837 \u2014 Churchwardens : Mr. Barnes and Mr. Parsons.

Modern Advance.\u2014 The tide of progress had started, and in \u2014 April, 1840. \u2014 At a meeting of the Board of Commissioners, Mr. Robert Jolly* intimated his intention of providing a plan for watering the streets of Woolwich. But the old inhabitants were slow to recognise their backward state, and were a long time being convinced. The First Town Hall. \u2014 We have seen that the plot of ground in William Street had been purchased with part of the price obtained by the sale of the parish rights over the Common, and that when the market failure was recognised, the Commissioners decided to utilise the ground for a town hall and offices. This met, of course, with opposition, and \u2014 At a Vestry held on March 23rd, 1840, to resist the building of the Town Hall and Board-room in \" the New Market \" it was stated that the clerk of the Board of Commissioners received \u00a340 (!) a year, and \" had only to look after the roads,\" and that the solicitor had \u00a370 a year for getting the parish into law. After many stormy discussions at the Board, the building was approved, and a tender of \u00a3646 10s. accepted for the work, as designed by Mr. Kinton. The structure was finished in the September following, but it was immediately coveted by the newly-organised police, and on the 10th October, 1840, the Board of Commissioners agreed to sell the new hall to the Government for the sum of \u00a31,322, which included a charge of \u00a34 per foot for the freehold site. The cottage behind, at that time occupied by Mr. Postle, the Foreman of Roads, was also sold under * Father of Mr. J. B. Jolly, J.P., &c."], [166, "70 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. the same agreement for an additional \u00a3200, and is now the residence of the court usher. The Second Town Hall. \u2014 Then the Board of Commissioners at once set about building another hall and offices, and in March, 1841, tenders were opened for the work, when the lowest offer, amounting to \u00a3887, was found to have been sent in by Messrs. W. and J. Cann, and it was accepted. The present hall and offices beneath were thereupon erected, and have answered their purpose moderately well.* The whole transaction was unquestionably beneficial to the town. The ratepayers netted \u00a33,000 for the Common without losing any real privileges ; they made a good bargain in selling the first hall to the police, and secured for Woolwich one of the best courts of justice to be found in the Metropolitan area ; having eventually, close to the same spot, their own public hall and offices in a central and convenient yet quiet locality. The original hall was divided for police court purposes by a bisecting wall, forming court and ante-room. Mr. Robert Jolly. \u2014 The inhabitants seem for once to have been satisfied, and we see by a newspaper slip that some of them met together in 1841 to present an elegant silver cup to Mr. Robert Jolly, in testimony of their high appreciation of his character, and especially of his attention to the interests of the parishioners in superintending the erection of the Town Hall. Sectarianism. \u2014 Disputes, however, arose quite early as to the letting of the new Town Hall for sectarian purposes. In January, 1844, we read that the British Reformation Society wanted the use of the hall for a public meeting. It was objected that the Roman Catholics might want it for an opposition meeting, and it was proposed that the application be granted for \u00a310. The charge was fixed at \u00a34 10s. as a sufficient deterrent. Sir Robert Peel's Police. \u2014 The police were introduced into Woolwich in January, 1840, but the police court was not opened until the following October, when Mr. Jeremy sat for the first time in the new building. A court had previously been held at the Castle Inn, Powis Street, by the county justices, who presided in the long trian gular apartment now principally used for coroner's inquests. The court was held every Monday and Friday. Small Debts. \u2014 For the recovery of small debts under \u00a35 there was a local authority called \" The Court of Requests,\" t held every alternate Friday at some decent tavern, generally the Crown and Anchor or the * The Clerk's offices have been added within the last twenty years, and the enlargement of the Board-room dates from 1878. t See Page 69."], [167, "WOOLAVICH. 71 King's Arms. This court was elected by the parishioners on Easter Tuesday, and five members were required to constitute a Bench. But there was still another legal tribunal for the settlement of first offences of a mild description, such as unjust weights and measures, and this was the Board of Commissioners. In 1839, for instance, we find that Mr. Watts, the high constable, was busy haling before this Board a number of tradesmen for their careless or dishonest inattention to the standard, and the Board, having heard what the offenders had to say, ordered them to be taken before the magistrates for punishment. County Court. \u2014 Debtors and creditors whose disputes exceeded the \u00a35 jurisdiction of the Court of Requests had to go to the superior courts in London until the County Court was established at Greenwich, to which money-claims large and small, not exceeding \u00a350, were then referred, and the Court of Requests ceased to exist. The inconvenience of attending at Greenwich, however, was of short duration, for the branch County Court at Woolwich was opened on December 29th, 1848. The parish was subjected to tho bankruptcy jurisdiction of Green wich on January lst, 1870, and included in the London Court of Survey District, October 6th, 1876. The Old Watchmen. \u2014 Sir Robert Peel's policemen were not extended to Woolwich on their first introduction to the Metropolis, and the town was for some time longer under the domination of the old parish constables and watchmen. But on February 23rd, 1839, the papers reported that \u2014 A public meeting is announced to be held by the inhabitants of Woolwich to consider the propriety of petitioning for the introduction of the new police force into that town. When it is considered that there are twenty thousand inhabitants, six or eight night watchmen, and only one police officer by day, some further protection is necessary. In due time the boon was promised and arrangements made, as already stated, for the police to begin duty in January, 1840, when, lo ! on January 4th a tardy vestry resolved almost unanimously to oppose their introduction. The opposition came too late, and we find the advent of the police into the garrison town heralded by the following \u2014 General Order, Jan. 13th, 1840. The Commandant has received intimation that a portion of the Metropolitan Police will commence duty to-day in the parishes of Woolwich, Plumstead, and Charlton. He thinks it necessary to remind the troops that the object of the Government is for the better security of persons and property, and the general conservation of the public peace. He therefore expects the utmost harmony will exist between the military and police, and that on all occasions when called upon they will aid the police in the execution of their duty."], [168, "72 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT.

A Fall Down a Chimney.\u2014 The following amusing incident found them some employment on the early morning of May 30th, in this year. Mrs. Lacey, of the Red Lion, Mulgrave Place, was awakened by loud groans and woke her husband, who found the house full of smoke and the bar strewed with soot. Tracing the cause to the chimney, he poked up an iron bar and found a man stuck fast, but, having taken out the register, the intruder was dragged down. He proved to be an artilleryman, well known at the house, and living a few doors off. He said that he was in the habit of smoking his pipe on Mr. Lacey's chimney pot, and slipped down !

The Twopenny Post. \u2014 There is no doubt that the town was at this period beginning to assume its later importance. In 1830 it had been made one of the centres or \" rides \" of the twopenny post, of which there were but nine in the whole of the suburbs round London. From this centre the letters were conveyed by the postcart to the following stations, which were called \" walks : \" Blaekheath, Green wich, Deptford, Kent Road, Peckham, Lewisham, Eltham, and Bexley Heath. An Elopement. \u2014 Two newspaper extracts of 1832 and 1833 may be inserted here. The first is matrimonial : \u2014 Jan. 21, 1832. \u2014 Yesterday between twelve and one a respectable-looking couple accompanied by a bridesmaid and groom, arrived at St. Mary's, Whitechapel, with a licence. The marriage ceremony was about to commence when two others rushed into the church in breathless haste. They were the father and uncle of the young woman, who had eloped and was going to marry contrary to the wishes of her friends- She is iu her twenty-second year and of very prepossessing appearance, is the daughter of a wealthy innkeeper at AVoolwich, and entitled to considerable property. Her adorer is only a constable of the police, and she declared that nothing hut absolute force should separate her from her lover ; but her friends removed both of them from the church, and consented that the young man should accompany her home. Making bis Bed. \u2014 The second paragraph is funereal, and appeared in 1833:\u2014 Mr. John Cox, stonemason, of Woolwich, many years ago built himself a vault in the churchyard, in which he placed a stone coffin to receive his mortal remains, and, wishing to save executors as much trouble as possible, he erected a tombstone specifying the day of his birth and that he died on the day of 181 , supposing that event would have taken place in the year eighteen hundred and some \" teen\" or other ; but having got through the teens into the twenties, he altered the latter date to 182 ; and, having again beaten old time, and safely entered into * The first appointments actually date from 1839, having been made in anticipa tion of the opening of the Police Court. t Nov. 3rd, 1839. \u2014 Board of Commissioners.

The old gentleman is near ninety, and often hobbles on his crutches to the place of his ultimate retirement, to rub out the dates which mischievous urchins chalk upon his tomb. He died in 1835. The \"Woolwich Advertiser. \u2014 A decent - looking newspaper, called Tlie Woolwich Advertiser and Local Intelligencer, was started on January, 12th, 1839, price fourpence, and, although it comprised but four small pages, was a fair sample of a local paper of that date. In December, 1840, we read therein \u2014 Woolwich is the emporium for all the surrounding towns and villages. The inhabitants of Eltham, Chiselhurst, the Crays, Welling, even of Dartford and Bexley, and the fast-rising new town of Bexley Heath, regularly resort to Woolwich to replenish their shops. The farmer and man of business haste here weekly to pay into the Bank of England branch, while the humble individual seeks the Savings Bank to place his small deposit. No Public Buildings. \u2014 The erection of the Town Hall appears to have been a work of some necessity, for of public buildings devoted to assemblies and amusements there was a decided scarcity. All the public gatherings which are chronicled were held either in the open air, in schoolrooms, or in taverns.* Theatres. \u2014 Dramatic performances, which have an ancient and uni versal history, w*ere no exception to the foregoing rule.

The \"Theatre Royal.\" \u2014 The theatre in Beresford Street, recently rebuilt, dates from 1835, and appears to have a legitimate, though remote and slender, claim to the \" Royal \" title which it assumes. Its history may be roughly sketched by a few extracts from the newspapers. On Januarj* 3rd, 1835, it was advertised as the \u2014 New Portable Theatre, Beresford Street, Woolwich.

The First Elementary Schools.\u2014 A reference which has been made to the British and Foreign Schools requires the explanation that prior to their establishment the only schools for the poor were that founded by Mrs. Withers in Rope Yard Rails and the school adjoining Enon Chapel, both of which are elsewhere dealt with. But about 1820 the town began to realise its educational necessities, and several good private schools were started, with useful results. The National Schools also were founded and opened in the Harmonic Hall (now Co-operative Hall) in Powis Street, and remained there until the present schools in King Street were built, in 1840. The British and Foreign enterprise was worked under the incubus of a troublesome debt, and we find the following advertisement : \u2014 Oct. 9th, 1834. \u2014 The committee of the British and Foreign Schools, Powis Street, Woolwich, beg to acquaint the ladies and gentlemen of the Borough of Greenwich that His Majesty's Government have granted the sum of \u00a3225 towards paying off the debt upon the building, but only on condition that the remaining sum of \u00a3235 is bona fide raised by the friends of the institution.

Booth, Auctioneers, Woolwich. Gas. \u2014 The last-quoted item brings up the subject of gas, a beneficial discovery which the dilatory town was slow to adopt. There were gas works in Woolwich for nearly twenty years before the prejudice against the \" new-fangled light \" was overcome. The first gas factory was a very small concern at the bottom of Surgeon Street, on the site of Edgar's coal wharf, and belonged to one of the Livesay family, the first manager being Mr. Sanderson, who had previously exhibited the light in his shop window, in Richard Street (the upper part of Hare Street). The charge for the gas was thirteen shillings per thousand feet, and the few public lamps that were supplied with the wonderful illuminant were never lighted on moonlight nights nor during the summer. This embryo enterprise, which dated from 1820, was merged in the Equitable Gas Company when that company was started in 1832. The Consumers' (at first styled \" The Protective \") Company originated in 1844, and both were absorbed in the South Metropolitan system in 1885 (lst Jan.). It is worthy of note that one of the Livesay family is at the head of our present gas supply, being chairman of the South Metropolitan Company, just mentioned The experi ments which preceded the introduction of coal gas as a lighting agent were made at Shooters' Hill ; and, seeing this early connection of the district with the now universal gaslight, it is discreditable to note that the streets generally were lighted with oil until 1844.

Woolwich in 1840. \u2014 The growth and progress of the town had then begun, but it was still a town far different from the Woolwich of to-day."], [179, "WOOLWICH. 79 In 1840 the private houses in Powis Street greatly outnumbered the shops, even at the busier end, next the Royal Arsenal. The Pres byterian church at the south-east corner stood in a graveyard, and the site is now covered by the Powis Arms and the shops of Messrs. Reed and Purvis in Green's End, and the butcher's shop in Powis Street. Close to the British and Foreign School, on the north side, was the shop of Mr. Giles, the principal draper in the town, and nearly opposite was the only ironmonger's, kept then and for many years afterwards by Newhall, then Whale, and so on. Hammond's toyshop was a big butcher's, kept by Cook, afterwards Harding. Another flourishing butcher was Smith at the Market Head, but the most important of all was Bassett in Church Street. Dinmore's rope warehouse has sur vived \u2014 almost the only relic of Powis Street in 1840. In Hare Street, Bland the butcher remains, but where is his rival, Cornish ? The only poulterer in Woolwich at that time was Greenwood in High Street ; and Morgan, in the same street, kept the largest baker's shop. It is there now, close to Plaisted's tavern. Trade had begun to move southward along Green's End in 1841. The principal auctioneer, Mr. Austin, had his office where now is located Mr. Hughes, M.P., solicitor ; the Round House was built soon after, and Mr. E. Jones kept the principal post-office at \" The Library,\" which was then the lounge of military officers, and is now the Kentish Independent office. The western side of Wellington Street was then formed of private houses, and the eastern side, unbuilt upon, was still the Sappers' Green ; the streets were lighted with the oil lamps which had been in vogue for two hundred years, and a few remained even in 1849. The last was in Union Street. The Coming Dawn. \u2014 Hitherto the march of progress had been a laggard pace, but about this period new aspirations prevailed, and another era began to dawn. The laws of health were diligently and in telligently studied, and the unsanitary state of things, which had been endured in the past as quite of the natural order, were seen and exposed in all their horrible deformity. There was an almost entire absence of drainage prior to 1853. The governing bodies had been talking of it for twenty years, and on the 10th of October, 1843, a serious discussion had taken place on the question. The idea at that time was to drain Brewer Street only at a cost of \u00a3400, but the whole town was said to have been in a filthy state for want of drainage. The curbing and chanelling of some of the streets was at that time in progress, but it was not for many years that the general paving of the footpaths was accomplished. In a local guide-book, published by Mr. R.uegg in 1847, there is this impeachment : \u2014 The town is in a state of unparalleled prosperity, but is perhaps the dirtiest, filthiest, and most thoroughly mismanaged town of its size in the kingdom. No town presents"], [180, "80 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. greater facilities for cleanliness, nearly all the streets being elevated ; but there is hardly a public sewer in the parish, and the channels are allowed to become the recep tacles of all kinds of filth. The Great Ten Years. \u2014 This state of affairs, being as bad as possible, was bound to mend, and circumstances helped the reformation. There is no denying that the most important decade in the history of Woolwich and the locality was that which followed the year 1850, but to these ten years ought justly to be added the five preceding and the five succeeding ones to cover the approaching and subsiding gradients of activity. Public Inquiries. \u2014 In 1845 there was a Governmental inquiry at Woolwich by Captain Denison, R.E., one of the Commissioners for inquiring into the state of large towns, and he had recommended an efficient and thorough system of drainage, a proper and adequate water supply, the construction of public baths, and a better paving and cleansing of the streets. But little, if anything, was done, and matters did not progress much beyond the stage of discussion until a second and more effective investigation was made in 1848, by Mr. Robert R,awlinson, Superintending Inspector of the General Board of Health, who was sent down in response to a forcible petition, subscribed to by the Rev. W. Greenlaw, Rector, and four hundred and forty inhabitants \u2014 being more than ten per cent, of the rated inhabitants, who were under four thousand. The petition appears to have been an exhaustive statement of the case, and bears the evident impress of Mr. Ruegg's hand. It stated that there were at that time six thousand troops in the garrison, and three thousand men employed in the Dockyard and Arsenal. It was a critical period, and demands a new chapter."], [181, ""], [182, "[To face pago 81.] JVoolwichin 1840.

The Public Health. \u2014 It is but fair to say that the inhabitants had at last become thoroughly roused to the necessity of vigorous action to improve their sanitary state, and free the town from its discreditable condition and character. But the primary need had been an increase of powers enabling them to raise capital wherewith to carry out all the improvements demanded. In 1848 the Public Health Act was passed, and to that Act, aided by the courage and self-sacrifice of the generation which is passing away, Woolwich owed its new birth. At that time the town was still under the local acts of 1807-8, and the Commissioners, thirty-three in number, did their best to administer its weak and ancient rules.

Setting to Work. \u2014 To these Commissioners, and to some others who will be hereafter named, the official investigation and the early application ofthe Public Health Act to Woolwich are in the main due, with all the many and great advantages which have resulted there from. To understand what this means it is needful to realise the state of Woolwich at the time, and for this purpose the evidence given before Mr. Rawlinson must be cited : Dr. F. Bossey produced tables relating to the mortality, and showed that, after deducting the convict establishment, the death rate was 22 per 1,000, while in Lewisham it was but 17, his inference being that out of the 36,000 people in Wool wich, 180 died prematurely every year. This he showed was traceable to the worst conditioned parts of the town by the following figures : \u2014 District. Population. Persons Deaths in Fevers, Proportion of per house. 4-j years. &c. deaths per 1000. Woolwich Common, &c. . . 842 6-4 53 13 13-8 High Street, &c. . . . 1,754 7:0 134 41 17-0 Union Gardens, &c. . . . 697 5-5 72 29 22-9 Cannon Row, &c. . . .804 6-6 97 31 26'8 These facts proved a startling excess of mortality in the lower districts of the town, and Dr. Bossey traced various causes, especially heaps of foul refuse in dustmen's yards, filth in open ditches and gutters, an over-filled churchyard, defective water supply, overcrowding of dwellings, and especially the great tract of marsh land at Plumstead, which presented many acres of stagnant water and undrained bog. To this he attributed the great prevalence of ague, fevers, jaundice, neuralgia, and other diseases of the liver and spleen, and he stated that in 1847 out of 420 convicts in the Justitia, 405 attacks occurred."], [185, "83 WOOLWICH. Dr. J. Butler corroborated Dr. F. Bossey, and said that the prevalence of dysentery and diarrh\u0153a might be alleviated by the better drainage of the houses. Dr. Prater said the town was completely riddled with cesspools, and many inhabi tants had typhus repeatedly, while cholera and erysipelas found the town a very hot bed. Dr. Peter Bossey said that in Hare Street there was no sewer, and the butchers and fishmongers emptied their slops into the street every morning. The blood and offal from the slaughterhouses flowed down the open gutters. In Myrtle Place, for instance, there was an open gutter along which the house drainage ran. The cesspools in many places were pumped out into the street. Dr. Wm. Stuart and Dr. Macintosh, of the Royal Artillery, gave similar evidence. Colonel Dundas spoke especially of the injury resulting from the marsh malaria, and said that he could not live in the Arsenal. Mr. R. Ruegg was then examined at length. He pointed out that the seven thousand soldiers of the garrison were chiefly young and healthy men, and ought to be deducted from the mortality tables, which would make the death rate much higher. In the spring of 1848, as many as four thousand persons were attacked with disorders ot the zymotic class in Woolwich and Plumstead, due in his opinion entirely to the marshes. Mr. George Hudson said the drainage from Red Lion Street and Mulgrave Place flowed over the surface and came down Brewer and WilUam Streets, the effluvia being so had that he could scarcely open his windows. Surgeon Davis, R.A., said Barrack Court, beyond the Mill in Mill Lane,* was very unhealthy, and other courts near the Barracks were nearly as bad. The Government provided one hundred cottages on the Common for married soldiers, and these were kept very clean and healthy, t A special report on ague, which was then so prevalent at Woolwich and Plumstead, was presented by Dr. Peter Bossey, who said there had been that year numberless cases, affecting grown persons, children, and even infants. This he ascribed to the increasing defects of the marsh lands, which the owners of cattle had dammed up to prevent the entrance of salt water, and thereby hindered the drainage. Ague and low fever spread even over the higher ground, and in Hopgood's Cottages, newly built above the Slade, he had attended twenty-six cases within a few weeks. He found that in 1778, of 632 convicts in the hulks no less than 142 died in eleven months of fever, which broke out after they had worked ashore below Woolwich. The question of the water supply was then gone into. The mains of the Kent Water Company had been extended into the town, but the charge was very high (5s. to 7s. 6d. per room per annum), and the water was deficient in quantity. It was pumped from the Ravensbourne, and was said to be bad in quality also. Mr. Hethrington said he got water from a cart in the street at three pails a penny. Mr. Ruegg said very few of the houses in the town took the company's water. The Kent Water Company forwarded a statement setting forth that they suppbed 1,720 houses in Woolwich. They also said that the Woolwich Commissioners had in 1808 contracted with Boulton and Watt for a steam pumping engine, and taken a lease of some springs from Sir T. M. Wilson for ninety-nine years at the yearly rent of \u00a3105, but had not supplied a house or laid a pipe. The company in 1811 bought the lease of them for \u00a32,625, but the springs were worthless ; and they also bought the steam engine for \u00a31,000, and found that it had never been unpacked. Like the springs it was useless, and was afterwards sold for \u00a3500. * The site of the Auxiliary and Female Hospitals. t The huts near the camp, afterwards visited with diphtheria, and pulled down in 1875."], [186, "84 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. It was also stated by the company that theysuppbed all the Government buildings, and had constructed for tbe Government in 1844 the reservoir on Woolwich Common for the extinction of fire. The crowded state of the churchyard, in which burials were then permitted, was also the subject of inquiry, and some scandalous details were given. Of the attention paid to the roads, Captain Denison's report furnishes the following evidence : \u2014 The materials of which the streets or roadways of Woolwich are composed render any attempt to cleanse or sweep them unavailing. A loose, badly-binding gravel, procured in the neighbourhood,* in summer is soon reduced to dust and in winter to mud, and is washed away by heavy rains into the gutters, choking them up and causing their contents to be spread over the roadway ; and what is called cleansing the roads consists in emptying and cleaning out these gutters and throwing the contents back again into the roadway.

The terrible death-rate in the Arsenal district may well have cried out for inquiry and redress. The Inspector declared that quite one half the deaths were \" preventable,\" \u2014 overcrowding, defective pave ment, deficient and impure water, and a total absence of drainage being the causes of all the physical evil and of much that was immoral and criminal. Verdict and Sentence. \u2014 The ultimate conclusion of Mr. Raw linson was an utter condemnation of the existing arrangements, and his emphatic recommendation was that the Public Health Act of 18-18 should be forthwith adopted at Woolwich. The Inspector advised the creation of a Local Board, having upon it representatives of the Government interest in the town.* The Local Board of Health. \u2014 Prompt action followed. The Public Health Act was put in force, and a Local Board of Health was constituted, consisting of eighteen elected members and three Govern ment representatives.

Nokes, the two officials of the defunct Commissioners, the Board advertised for a competent surveyor, and Mr. John Barnett was elected out of a large number of candidates. Other advisers were also called in to help with their experience, and the main drainage of the town was at once started. The excellent"], [189, "WOOLWICH. 87 sanitary condition of the parish at the present time has been purchased at the following cost : \u2014 Loan of \u00a316,500 at 4 per cent., 23rd August, 1853. \u00a32,000 at 5 \u201e 31st March, 1857. \u00a33,000 at 5 \u201e 13th March, 1865. \u00a321,500 The loans were borrowed for thirty years of the Royal Exchange Assurance Company, and have thus been borne with something like fairness by a succession of ratepayers. The highest annual rate made by the Board reached seven shillings and sixpence in the pound in 1870 ; the lowest four shillings and sixpence, in 1860. These sums do not include the Private Improvement Rate, which was simply a repayment made by the house-owners of the money advanced by the Local Board for private works connected with the drainage, and spread over thirty years. The Crimean War-time. \u2014 Decisive action came only just in time, for in 1854 the great War with Russia broke out, the demand for warlike productions enormously increased, the population multiplied at a marvellous bound, and, although Woolwich has had its stages of depression since, it may safely date from 1854 a strength and standing to which it never before attained, and from which it has never yet descended. But it was not alone the Crimean War which brought this change. The duty of improving and maintaining the national defences had begun to be recognised, and gradually to affect the productive power of the national Arsenal, some years prior to that event, and Woolwich was progressing numerically and commercially before the Emperor Nicholas defied the Powers of Europe. It was progressing also in another and no less important direction. The Age of Intellect. \u2014 To the first half of the nineteenth century will ever belong a principal share in the glory of scientific achievements. It witnessed the development of Steam and Railways, the discovery of the Electric Telegraph, the growth of universal Educa tion, Political Liberty, and a Free Press. It was the era of literary institutions, the season of sanitary enlightenment, when cleanliness and temperance began to be taught as essential elements in the physical and intellectual advancement of the people, and it will ever be a satis factory reflection to Woolwich that among all the towns of England she, at this momentous crisis, was not found wanting. Men of Enterprise. \u2014 The generation which so promptly and energetically led the enterprise of Woolwich to early triumphs in the establishment of steamboat companies, gas companies, and such-like"], [190, "88 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. undertakings for the public welfare, could not be devoid of men of capacity to deal with the health requirements of the population, and to these men we must admit that the town owes the credit of having been the first place in the whole Metropolis to accomplish a complete and efficient system of drainage. At first the sewers were discharged into the Thames at Trinity Street and Hog Lane (Nile Street), being stored in receivers until high tide, but in 1861 the Metropolis at large was also drained, and the Woolwich system was connected with the great outfall sewer which is carried away to Crossness. In consequence of having completed its drainage, Woolwich was specially exempted from most of the responsibilities imposed upon other Metropolitan parishes by the Metropolis Local Management Act of 1856. Never theless, it was for certain other purposes included in that Act and the subsequent Amendment Act, and the parish has always been represented by one member on the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Main Drainage of London. \u2014 The town, however, had to pay for the privilege of connecting with the great outfall, and has had more than its share of the annoyance of that effusion, by having it in such close vicinity. The creation of this enormous sewer through Woolwich caused less inconvenience than might have been expected, as it was done chiefly by tunnelling. Underground Woolwich. \u2014 In July, 1861, a few weeks before the completion of the work, a large party of the contractor's staff and their friends amongst the tradesmen and inhabitants of Woolwich, descended to explore the great tunnel, and held a jovial meeting under the dome where the principal junction exists in the centre of the town, which is near the Board Schools in Powis Street. Having provided themselves with plenty of champagne and other requisites for a jolly evening, they held high festival for several hours, the band of the 4th .Kent Rifle Volunteers (the town corps) assisting to wake the subterranean echoes in the bowels of Old Woolwich. The outfall sewer, as it passes through the town, is eleven feet in diameter. Steam Ferry. \u2014 No other work of such magnitude as the sewer has been seen at Woolwich in our time, but the Free Steam Ferry across the Thames promises to be one of the grandest accomplishments the town has ever achieved. It was decided upon by the Metropolitan Board in 1885, and ordered to be carried out at the cost of the whole Metropolis, as a set-off for the bridges provided in the more favoured west ; but nearly three years were consumed in negotiations, arbitra tions, and preparations. Paving. \u2014 Previously to 1863 the town was unpaved, except in"], [191, "[To face page 88.] View of the River from Woolwich. PLATE X\"V"], [192, ""], [193, "89 WOOLWICH. one or two places, including the footpath which led up New Road towards the Barracks, and was called, par excellence, \" The Pavement.\" But in that year the Local Board summoned courage to incur another loan of \u00a37,000, and paved the paths throughout with a course of York stone four feet wide. The Freehold Of Woolwich.\u2014 Public improvements at Woolwich have been greatly impeded by the land tenure. For the greater part of this century the bulk of the freehold of Woolwich has been held by the Ogilby family. Mr. James Ogilby, who died about 1885, resided in Ireland, and took so little interest in the town which he maj* be said to have almost owned, that he for the last fifty years of his life refused not onlv to sell any of his freehold but even to grant any extension of lease, being determined to leave the property, just as it was, to his heir. In 1898 the reversions will fall in."], [194, "CHAPTER VIII. ENTERPRISE. A.D. 1849. \u2014 In 1849, when junior imp of a printing office, and the humble servant of two proprietors and fifteen printers, I had an obscure part in the production of a \"Woolwich Directory,\" probably the first w*hich the town had ever seen. The issue was not a large one and the demand was not ravenous \u2014 circumstances which are to my present advantage, seeing that I have preserved a rare book. The contents of this Directory have peculiar charms for such as care to dwell upon the memories of the past, to conjure up the spirits of the old familiar men and women of the generation that has gone away, and to recall in a vivid presence their active lives, their words and works. Every page, it is true, is full of regrets ; it is like walking through a street of the dead, and losing one's self in a reverie among the tombs of departed friends. But, apart from its sad sermon on life and death, my Directory is a errand record of good men and noble achievements. O SD The Men of '49. \u2014 It is to these men of 1849 that Woolwich owes her early commercial prosperity, her many public undertakings and beneficial enterprises, and the inestimable blessings of health and com fort which, notwithstanding primary and inherent disadvantages, the town and the people have enjoyed for many years in advance of other towns, even those included, like Woolwich, within the girth of modern London. By promptly recognising and adopting the Public Health Act of 1848, our fathers not only rescued their parish from a state of sanitary degradation and affliction, and raised it to a respectable level in the bills of mortality, but they also saved its inhabitants many of the heavy burdens afterwards cast upon their less fortunate or less pro vident neighbours. The main drainage of the town, the paving of the footpaths, the making of sound roads, the provision of plentiful water, the closing of the churchyard and the making of a cemetery, were all costly undertakings, and needed some courage and self-denial at each successive plunge; but, fortunately for us, the right men were in the right places at the right time, and, carefully but fearlessly, step by step onward, they took upon themselves the obligation of loan after loan, and, undeterred by the pessimism which was called \"prudence,\" they carried out everything to which they set their hands. And, for the thirty years in which they and w*e have been paying off the debt, we have"], [195, "PLATE XVI Mill in Mill Lane, 1845. Old Road at Plumstead, 1886. [To face page 90.]"], [196, ""], [197, "WOOLWICH 91 together reaped the profit. Woolwich is not all that it might be even now, but, considering its lowly origin, its sickly childhood, and its neglected youth, the men of the mid-century may be said to have brought it fairly out of its troubles and given it a vigorous manhood, which, in spite of its unshapely form and features, is likely to endure. Our fathers, at any rate, did better than their fathers, and still better than their grandfathers, who seem to have lived and died under the impression that the world was made especially for them, and never dreamt of leaving it better than they found it. Many of the \"improve ments \" which have lately faced us, and some which still face us, are but corrections of ancestral blunders. Mr. Richard Ruegg. \u2014 -When Woolwich, in 1861, presented to Mr. Richard Ruegg a handsome testimonial, an acknowledgment was made more truthful than testimonials usually are. It typified the satisfaction of the town at the fulfilment of the measures which he had been one of the first to advocate and promote, especially the drainage and the paving. As a deep and thoughtful reader, a scholar, a man of scientific acquirements, an able writer, and a good debater, he had been for many years engaged in stimulating the inhabitants to action by all the means within reach, including the newspaper which he edited, the Kentish Independent ; and, when the time came for making up their minds, the people knew at least something about the merits of the question. Mr. W. P. Jackson. \u2014 At every step Mr. Ruegg was warmly sup ported by his friend and coadjutor on the Press, Mr. William Parr)* Jackson, then in part, and afterwards wholly*, proprietor of the newspaper just named. Mr. Jackson served many years upon the Local Board of Health, and was for an unexampled period its chairman, besides repre senting the town on the Metropolitan Board and discharging other prominent duties.* Mr. George Hudson. \u2014 Another worker who w*as early in the field, and rendered most valuable service, was Mr. George Hudson, whose practical knowledge of surveying and business experience were of essen tial benefit to the parish at such a j uncture. The Rev. William Greenlaw, Rector of Woolwich, and his two churchwardens, Messrs. Morgan and TRoff, were also well in front at this stirring time ; and special mention might be made of other zealous public men, including indeed the whole of the Commissioners then in office. Mr. Thomas Morgan. \u2014 Mr. Thomas Morgan, who had a share in the destinies of the place for nearly ninety years, was long known affectionately as \" the father of Woolwich.\" He was born in High * The position to which Mr. Jackson attained unquestionably entitles him to a leading place in these records.

He devoted much of his life to the town, serving all the parochial offices, being an early mem ber of the Board of Commissioners, and the first chairman of the Local Board of Health. He was an active supporter of the Woolwich Savings Bank, the special friend of the parish almshouses, and no man was ever more sincerely esteemed for his kindness of heart and unswerv ing honesty of purpose. In his time, and largely by his means, a new town grew out of the old Woolwich, and its period of highest develop. ment, during which most of its houses were built and its general improv ment accomplished, was fortunate in having his guiding hand. He survived this busy era for many years, his bright intellect and cheer ful manner remaining to edify and delight his friends, and many records of Woolwich have I gathered from his lips. Full of years and univer sally respected, he died at his residence in Brewer Street on the 17th of November, 1884, and he was reverently laid to rest three days later in St. Thomas's churchyard.

In 1860 commenced practice as solicitor at Woolwich, and was the same year elected on Local Board. Had been secretary to Mutual Building Society for five years, but now assisted to found the Woolwich, Plumstead, and Charl ton (now Kent and Surrey) Building Society, and became its solicitor. Was also appointed Conservative agent for the Woolwich district ; was in 1863 elected Vestry Clerk of Plumstead, and has several times had a seat upon the Plumstead District Board ; was a director of the Woolwich Steamboat Company and of the Consumers' Gas Company. In 1862 was commissioned second lieutenant of Plumstead Volunteer Artillery. As a political agent he is credited with the Conservative supremacy in the County of Kent and City of London, having conducted the registration and many elections in both.

AVoolwich Dockyard and Ropeyard Officers, viz. : Mr. John Hayward, Master Shipwright ; Mr. Joseph Downes, Assistant ; Mr. John Smith, Storekeeper ; Mr. Jethro Barton, Master Ropemakei- ; Mr. James Felton, Storekeeper to ye AA'arren ; Jonas Hardyng, Gentleman ; John Hammond, mealman ; John Watson, potter ; Richard Hammond, mealman ; Thomas Rose, baker ; John Pullman, shipwright ; Matthew Cartwright, cooper ; Joseph Shortrouch, shipwright ; Benjamin Slading, shipwright ; Edward Gray, shipwright ; Thomas Bartrum, ropemaker ; John Hos kins, shipwright ; Richard Cooler, shipwright. (Signed) A. Reynolds, R. Cavell, Petty Constables. This list probably does not mention the whole of the \u00a310 freeholders, and I doubt that all those named were in the Government service. The Borough of Greenwich. \u2014 But even when the borough was formed in 1832, tbe persons entitled to vote were only 741 in Woolwich, 87 in Charlton, and 47 in the part of Plumstead which came within the boundary \u2014 this being a line drawn from the Storekeeper's house to the stile at the top of Sandy Hill. In 1840 the full register of the borough gave the following electors : \u2014 Greenwich, 1,371 ; St. Paul, Deptford, 932; St. Nicholas, Deptford, 319; Woolwich, 1,049 ; Charlton, 91; Plumstead, 48. Total, 3,810. The greater part of the growing parish of Plumstead was omitted until 1868, when the Boundary Commissioners took the whole of it into the Borough of Greenwich. The Borough of Woolwich was constituted in 1885, and the number of voters on register may be given to contrast with the figures of 1832 : Woolwich, 4,012 ; Plumstead, 5,064 ; to which must be added Eltham, 693. Charlton, which is within the limits of the newly defined Borough of Greenwich, has just over 1,100 voters. The First Great Struggle. \u2014 In 1835, half a century before Woolwich became a separate borough, it was engaged in its first serious political battle. There had been the election of 1832, of course, to constitute the new Parliament under the Reform Act, but on that occasion all the candidates were Liberals, and the newly fledged electors had hardly had sufficient time to realise their privileges. Even thus wich, was himself returned as its first member of Parliament, Was in 1877 gazetted Lieutenant-Colonel of the 2nd Kent Artillery Volunteers, which he had raised from a single battery of thirty-seven members to a brigade of 480.

November 18th, 1832. \u2014 A meeting was held at the Abercrombie Arms, when the gallant candidate, Captain AAr. Deans Dundas, was introduced. The Artillery band played many airs and several toasts were given, and at a late hour the party sepa rated, full of good wine and good humour. This will be a successful canvass. It is the only jolly, joyous, musical, social, spirited, and becoming electioneering meeting we have had to record. But it was reserved for 1835 to witness the first daring attempt of a Tory invasion and a real strug gle. The Liberal candidates were Mr. Barnard and Mr. John Angerstein, and to their attack came the terrible Con servative, Mr. M. W. Attwood. Bribery and Corruption, \u2014 The battle waged is never to be forgotten. For weeks together there was strife and fun and excitement every day. Processions always moving, bands of music always play ing, unlimited silk given away for flags and ribbons, and money fly ing about ;is freely as the colours \u2014 these were the ordinary experiences of elec tion times fifty years ago. Every publican thought it was necessary that he should have a committee sitting daily Admiral Dundas, M.P., 1847. in his club-room, and at many of them there was a free-drinking privilege known as \" open house\" for several days before the polling. Without inferring that votes were bought and sold, it may be safely said that bribery and corruption were the law of elections in 1835. Their mildest form was the frequent present of a silk handkerchief in the colour of the candidate to the voter's wife ; and many of the tradespeople, who would have been horrified at a bribe, looked upon a substantial order for goods from the candidate of their fancy as quite a proper thing. Nomination and Polling. \u2014 At that time there was only one hust ings, which stood in the open space beside St. Alphage Church at Green wich, and everybody went there to vote. TNearlv all the voters went there"], [213, "WOOLAVICH. 105 also on the day before the polling to hold up both their hands at the nomination (generally known as the \" show of hands \"), and on the day after the poll they went again to hear the declaration. Hustings at Woolwich.\u2014 The nomination and the declaration of the poll were continued at Greenwich until the new plan of election was adopted in 1868, but the necessity of going to Greenwich to vote was avoided after two or three elections by the provision of hust ings at Woolwich. Until 1851, or a little later, these hustings were built on the Mar ket Hill in High Street, but Beres ford Square was afterwards selected as a more suitable spot. Of course there was no secret vot- ing in those days. Indeed, in 1835, a Greenwich paper printed the entire poll-book of the election, showing how every elector voted. We may say a little more about this election of 1835. The poll lasted two days, and the three can didates stood in the hustings to thank the voters as they came to General Codrington, M.P., 1857. poll. There was a great multitude, and vast excitement, people shout ing, and hands playing, colours flying, and frequent fights.

The church bells A Borough Election, 1852. were rung, and guns were fired, not only on Woolwich Common, but at the residence of Mr. Nokes, in Mulgrave Place (he was Mr. Angerstein's agent) and at other places. The day wound up with dinners and conviviality everywhere. The Champion at the Feast. \u2014 Amongst the rest \u2014 A dinner was held at the Crown and Anchor to celebrate the return to Parlia ment of Mr. J. Angerstein, whose son, Col. Angerstein, was present. Mr. J. Butler was chairman, and about a hundred gentlemen sat down to dinner. During the proceedings the attention of the com pany was arrested by a most interesting exhibition. The champion of Mr Anger stein, armed at all points, and bearing a shield with the honourable member's arms, made his appearance, and, having proceeded to the chair, drank a bumper of wine to the health of Mr. Angerstein, member for the Borough of Greenwich, Mr. W. Angerstein, M.P., 1859 and confusion to his enemies ; and declared^his willingness to do battle to the death for his noble master. Colonel Angerstein then\" drank to the health ofthe champion, who retired backwards out of the room amid the loudest cheers. The health of the"], [216, "108 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. other member of the borough, Mr. E. G. Barnard, was also given, and that of Mr. Nokes, who remarked that the 9th of January was a day never to be forgotten. A Mr. Jolly, he said, bad laid the foundation of the building by giving the first vote to Mr. Angerstein, and he should propose Mr. Jolly's health. Mr. Jolly returned thanks. (This was Mr. R. Jolly, father of Mr. J. R. Jolly, J.P.) Political Variations.\u2014 It is unnecessary to describe all the subsequent elections, though each has had its peculiar features. The sketch on the preceding page illustrates one of the most remarkable of the struggles, that of 1852, when for the first. time since 1837 (when Mr. Att wood was returned), a Conser vative (Mr. Peter Rolt) wrested one of the seats from the Liberals.

Barges and Tilt Boats. \u2014 The above woodcut, taken from a sketch made by Canot in 1753, shows the favourite mode of travelling between Woolwich and London during the last century. The tilt boats, as they were described, sailed with the tide, and our fathers have told us of the strange hours at which they were accustomed to embark. In their time, speaking of say 1830, three of these boats were sufficient for the public requirements, and they occupied three hours on the journey. Many old residents remember when there were but two of these boats daily, one owned by Mr. Sales, and the other by Mr. Spurling, starting \"as the tide suits,\" night or day. At the time of Canot, however, one such conveyance was probably enough. Each was prohibited from carrying more than ten passengers ; and at one period the law required that two vacant places should be reserved for persons who might be picked up on the way. Fares by Water. \u2014 I have not ascertained the amount of the fare in 1753, but I have a \" Waterman's Table from Windsor to Woolwich \" of 1813, which states that the legal charge from London Bridge to Woolwich was, at that time, five shillings. The predecessors of the tilt boats were either watermen's wherries, hired by special bargain, or barges which carried passengers and merchandise together. A Penny Ride. \u2014 In 1562, when money values were many times higher than at present, the fare from London to Woolwich by barge was one penny each person, and to Gravesend twopence. A wherryman"], [225, "115 WOOLWICH. was not permitted to charge more than a shilling all told for the journey from London Bridge to Woolwich, working two oars.* Until stage coaches were started, Government officials, and such as were able to afford the luxury, kept their own boats and boatmen. Stage Coaches. \u2014 A stage coach ran daily to London and back from an early dates having its town rendezvous in Gracechurch Street. A road book of 1807 has a table showing tbat coaches from London to Woolwich started as follows : \u2014 From Morning. Afternoon. Swan, Charing Cross ... 9 \u2014 12 3 \u2014 8 Hope, do. ... 9 11 \u2014 368 Cross Keys, Gracechurch Street . \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 6 \u2014 Horse Shoe and Magpie, Bridge ) \u201e . .-, \u201e Street, Westminster . . ) Kings and Key, Fleet Street . 10 11 \u2014 3 6 8 In addition to the above there were several coaches daily passing over Shooters' Hill to Gravesend and Dover, and many poor people were conveyed in carriers' waggons. Rival Coaches. \u2014 It appears from the following paragraph that competition sprang up and was followed by some of its consequences. Sept. 16, 1822. \u2014 On Monday morning the Tally Ho of Woolwich, opposition coach, actuated by that spirit of rivalry which has of late been fatal to so many lives, had the temerity to pass down Blaekheath Hill J at full gallop. About midway down the hill it was thrown over with such violence that the side was driven in and broken to pieces. There were fifteen passengers, eleven outside and four inside, all of whom, without exception, received serious injury. Of Major McLeod, who was a passenger and a very fine young man, little hopes are entertained. Not one escaped without broken legs or arms, and several will, it is feared, lose their lives. Omnibuses. \u2014 Omnibuses were put on the road about 1830, and these also had their opposition to contend against. Shillibeer, who claimed to be the inventor of the omnibus, and afterwards rose to fame as the pioneer of cheap funerals, issued the following advertisement in April, 1835 : \u2014 Shillibeer's AAroolwich Omnibuses. \u2014 G. Shilbbeer has the pleasure to announce that in consequence of the monopolizing spirit exhibited by his rivals, and to afford the inhabitants of AVoolwich greater facility of conveyance, eight of his Greenwich omnibuses will leave AAroolwich daily for Oxford Street, Islington, and the City, and, to prevent collisions with his rivals, will start from the Star and Garter, Powis Street, at a quarter before or after the hours, calling at the Crown and Cushion and Globe * Cawood's Rates and Fares. t There were probably some such conveyances early in the eighteenth century, and the coaches from London to Dover by way of Shooters' Hill were available earlier still. t Blaekheath Hill in the olden times is illustrated at page 16."], [226, "116 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Taverns, and proceed without delay or changing vehicles, as hitherto, to their respec tive destinations. To compete with the steamers, the fares from Woolwich to London will be reduced to one shilling. To his patrons at Greenwich thus Shilbbeer writes, Or at least to his Laureat the poet indites : The omnibus I first invented all know, And abolished bad language as vulgar and low ; And my orders are, always behave to each fare With obliging attention, politeness, and care. It gives me much pleasure when this is the case, And I never allow them to gallop or race, Nor to loiter and wait and then rattle away, At the risk of your life, as was done every day. At the Star and the Garter from Woolwich I start, From the corner of Nelson Street, Greenwich, depart ; And old Centurion, Deptford, at the end of High Street, Are the place? my friends may my carriages meet. (In all ten verses.) Steamboats. \u2014 Circumstances were, however, too strong for the gifted Shillibeer. The steamboats gradually but surely superseded the coaches and omnibuses, though some (or at least one) of them, con tinued to run a precarious trade in the face of fate as lately as 1844, in which year we read that \u2014 Mr. (Jeorge Green's four-horse coach was turning the corner at the head of Powis Street, AVoolwich, when the driver fell from his box and was run over and killed. Greenwich Railway. \u2014 When the railway was made from London Bridge to Greenwich, the coaches from Woolwich, with rare exceptions, went to Greenwich only. A local \" Guide \" of 1837 informs us that \u2014 Omnibuses start from the Crown and Anchor ever}* half-hour, and vans every hour from the same spot, as far as the railway terminus at Greenwich. The First Steamer. \u2014 The Woolwich Steam-Packet Company was established in 1834, and was of great benefit to the town. Its first boat was the Sylph, and the following was one of its early advertise ments : \u2014 Woolwich steam-packets, Fairy, Sylph, and Naiad, continue to run every day from Woolwich : morning at 9, afternoon at 2 ; from Hungerford Market* : morning at 11, afternoon at 4 ; and will embark and disembark without tbe use of boats.

Fancy Names.\u2014 In 1837 the company had five boats, the Ariel being added to its fleet, and it may be observed that for every vessel which they built the company found an appropriate and kindred name, each one representing a sprite, and each one being formed of five letters. In 1837 the boats made four or five passages per day in Woolwich Piers in 1838. winter and seven or eight in summer, calling at Greenwich and Queen hithe. The Watermen's Company. \u2014 The success of the company and its competition with the scullers induced the latter to start a rival con cern, called the \"Watermen's Steam- Packet Company,\" and a strife hegan which nearly ruined both, but resulted in the older concern buy ing up and absorbing its weaker antagonist. The Watermen's pier was run out from their stairs at Bell Watergate, close to the Woolwich Company's pier at Strother's (now Ross's) Wharf as seen in the accom panying sketch. The Watermen also had their poet, who took up the strains of Dibdin and sang : \u2014"], [228, "118 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Now all the world flocks to the jolly steam watermen, From London to Woolwich through water they fly, And they paddle along with such ease and dexterity Charming each heart and delighting each eye. They look so neat and they run so steadily ; The ladies all flock to these boats so readily, And walk fore and aft with so charming an air, The Watermen ne'er are in want of the fair. The Piers. \u2014 The present pier was constructed subsequently to 1837, in which year, on November 10th, appears on the rolls of Parlia ment a \u2014 Notice to bring in a bill next sessions for a pier or jetty on tbe south of the Thames at Woolwich, between Globe Lane and the Dockyard, with approaches from High Street. The Railways. \u2014 There was certainly no room for local rivalries, seeing that formidable railway opponents were threatening on both sides of the river. The North Kent line was proposed in 1835, and Woolwich resented it with all its might. The following report of a meeting held on the subject, in 1836, deserves to become historical. At a very numerous and highly respectable private meeting of the house proprietors, owners of properties, tradesmen, and other inhabitants of the parish of Woolwich, on Friday, the Sth of February, 1836, to adopt measures in opposition to the project of a railroad from Greenwich to Gravesend passing through Woolwich (Sir John Webb, K.C.B., in the chair), the following resolutions were unanimously agreed to : \u2014 Resolved, on the motion of Mr. Colquhoun, seconded by Mr. Church \u2014 That the line of the Greenwich and Gravesend Railroad through the town of Woolwich in the manner proposed, by the excavation of an open ditch or cut of considerable width and depth, will be extremely injurious to the inhabitants. Resolved, on the motion of Mr. Samuel Noble, seconded by Mr. Henry Fish \u2014 That it does not appear that in any similar instance in railroad speculations that any such excavation or cut has ever been attempted through a town so densely populated, and that if the same be permitted there will be an end to the safety of persons and property. Resolved, on the motion of Mr. Lewis Davis, seconded by Mr. Thomas Parkes\u2014 That the proposed line of road will be a nuisance to the town, deprive the inhabitants of the benefits derived from the several springs, prevent a proper drainage, throw difficulties in the way of communication for gas and water, destroy numerous valu able properties, and render others valueless ; that the said plan is unnecessary, uncalled for, unsightly, ruinous, unparalleled, and altogether destructive of the town and the interests of its community, and that the said bill be opposed. The Railway Rejected.\u2014 The bill was, for the time, thrown out, and on the 8th of March following it was resolved at another meeting \u2014 That the grateful thanks of this meeting are due to James Colquhoun, Esq., of Woolwich, sobeitor, for his able opposition to the bill for making a railroad from London to Gravesend, by the successful opposition whereof the town of Woolwich has"], [229, "119 AVOOLWICH. been preserved from the destruction and ruin contemplated by the above-named project. The Railways Triumphant. \u2014 The \" preservation \" was, however, only for a few years longer, and when the inevitable railways came they were right welcome. The first line to Woolwich, however, was not the North Kent, but tho North Woolwich branch of the Eastern Counties (now Great Eastern) Company, which was opened in 1847. The South Eastern Company's North Kent line was opened in the summer of 1849.* The North Kent Cutting. \u2014 The cutting of the North Kent Railway did not have the fearful consequences which were contem plated, but it effected several other collateral changes, some of which ought to have been averted. The level crossing in Sand Street and the constriction of John Street were both unnecessary, but the drying-up of the ponds by the Dockyard Station was a decided advantage. It has been already stated that King Street and Coleman Street were con tinuous on the western side until the railway cut through and made an opening for North Kent Terrace, and two or three houses and shops were in like manner cleared away in Green's End. The plans of the railway, dated 1846, are to be seen in the Royal Artillery Library, where also is a good copy of the map made for the Town Commissioners in 1843. Water Journey. \u2014 Steamboat travellers may read old Stow's description of places on the Thames in his day (1720). He commences with Gravesend, \" Where the Lord Maior's jurisdiction begins.\" \" Gravesend,\" saith Stow, \" is a place of great resort, being the common landing place for strangers and seamen in their passage to London ; as likewise the accus tomary place of taking of shipping and the ready road for France. AU which doth occasion it to be well inhabited and resorted unto, and sufficiently furnished with inns, taverns, and other places of entertainment. And its markets, which are Wednesdays and Saturdays, are well provided ; yet all things want for no price. It is a maior town. Here is all the conveniency for travel for its inhabitants, either by water, or by land in the stage coaches or hackney horses, which are always to be had, either to London or Rochester, or elsewhere. \" Erith is a town of no great account. Opposite to this town in Essex is a place called Coldharbour. \" Raynham Creek on the side of Essex ; next to it is Dagenham Creek. About a mile and a half more westwards is the Halfway Tree in Essex side ; and over against in Kent is the Halfway House, so called as seated in the midway betwixt London and Gravesend. At Barking Creek two miles farther westward, and on the same side, is a lone house called \" the Devil's House,\" for whatjeason I known not. Over against Woolwich in Essex side is Ham Creek, and about two miles more westwards is the river Lee.\" * This was only to London Bridge. The extension to Charing Cross was not opened until Jan. llth, 1864."], [230, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 120 Latter-day Steamboats. \u2014 Notwithstanding all its troubles, the Woolwich Steam-Packet Company contrived to render good service to the town for many years, providing a cheap if somewhat slow con veyance for the inhabitants, and bringing down a vast number of visitors. It had rivals and other misfortunes, all of which it out lived, but in the year 1875 the enterprise was wrecked by London speculators, who, in an attempt to amalgamate the various steamboat services on the Thames, ruined them all. The Princess Alice disaster in 1878, and the foulness of the Thames, helped the evil fortunes of the river steamers, and now for some time the water service between Woolwich and London has been in a languishing and nearly dormant state. Railway Statistics. \u2014 The railways have, however, continued to flourish. From official information dated September, 1887, I find the average number of passengers daily from Woolwich to London and other up-stations to be \u2014 From the Arsenal Station about three thousand, and from the Dockj'ard, Station about two thousand. The arrivals are fairly represented by the same figures. The early workmen's trains have created a new traffic, the immigration of strangers far surpassing the emigration of inhabitants, consequent, no doubt, upon the exceptionally busy state of the Government works. Up passengers by early trains from Plumstead, 25 ; Arsenal Station, 75 ; Dock yard Station, 50. Down passengers from London, Deptford, Greenwich, &c, to Dockyard Station, 50 ; Arsenal Station, 500 ; Plumstead, 50. Building Societies. \u2014 The very earliest building society in the Metropolis arose in Woolwich, and it is prospering to-day. The germ was a small co-partnership which had its quarters in 1842 at the Castle Inn, the proprietor of which, Mr. Thunder, was the first chairman, the secretary being Mr. Evan Griffiths. Mr. Frederick Pearce and another were solicitors, Mr. Carrington surveyor. Mr. T. R. Richardson and other active members left the society in 1843, and formed another on improved principles, Mr. John Christie being chairman, Mr. W. Buchanan secretary, and Mr. Richardson a director, and this in 1847 became reconstituted on the \" permanent \" plan, under the name of the Woolwich Equitable Building Society, Mr. W. Stuart being the first chairman, and Mr. F. Pearce for a time both solicitor and secretary. For twenty-nine years Mr. Richardson was a director, and for eleven years chairman, resigning in 1887. Within the next few years the Woolwich Mutual Building Society, and the Woolwich, Plumstead, and Charlton, afterwards Kent and Surrey, Building Society, were set on foot, and have been in operation until now. Captain James Mutch, formerly of the Royal Engineers, was the first secretary of the"], [231, "121 AVOOLAVICH. Mutual, and Mr. Geo. Bryceson has been the only secretary of the Kent and Surrey. Literary Institutions. \u2014 The first attempt at intellectual culti vation of which we have any note was the establishment, in 1838, of a Literary, Scientific, and Practical Institution, which is said to have had two hundred members. The Moral and Intellectual Improvement Com pany had its offices at 48, High Street, in 1848, and in the same year was started the \"Woolwich Mutual Improvement Society,\" which held its meetings at the Infant Schoolroom in Brewer Street. Mr. T. R. Richard son was its secretary until 1851, when its name was changed to that of the \" Woolwich Athen\u00e6um,\" and it died a natural death. In June, 1850, the Baths and Lecture Hall were opened in Nelson Street, and in high hopes the new \" Literary and Scientific Institution\" was established, being inaugurated by a great conversazione, at which Lord Derby and other distinguished persons assisted. It had for a time some success, its secretaries being Mr. Stephen Hudson, Mr. Edwin Hughes and others, but its career was for the most part a struggle, and, after spending its declining years in an upper room at No. 37, Green's End, it expired from inanition about 1872.*"], [232, "Sir Martin Bowes, Lord Mayor of London, 1545. CHAPTER XL CHARITIES AND CUSTOMS. The Goldsmiths' Almshouses. \u2014 Upwards of three hundred years ago (it was in the reign of Elizabeth \u2014 1560) Sir Martin Bowes, knight and goldsmith, a resident at Woolwich (and Lord Mayor of London), erected five almshouses opposite Warren Lane for poor persons over fifty years of age, and endowed them with a yearly income arising from estates devised for the purpose. The allowance to the occupants was \u00a31 Os. 5d. a year each, to be paid quarterly by the Goldsmiths' Company of London, who were to make an inspection annually between Midsummer and Michaelmas ; to have a sermon at the parish church, and to give the churchwardens 7s. and the poor lid. A tablet in the front of the centre house was inscribed \u2014 These almshouses were endowed by Sir Martin Bowes, Knight, who was Lord Mayor of London, 1545, and were rebuilt by the Company of Goldsmiths, London, in the year 1771. In 1867-8 the income amounted to \u00a3252 18s. The almshouses were abolished in 1888, and the charity converted into pensions."], [233, "WOOLWICH. 123 Sir Martin Bowes. \u2014 Tradition has it that Sir Martin Bowes erected these almshouses in gratitude for the preservation of his son from drowning, but I find no evidence to confirm tho suggestion. I have, however, been so fortunate as to discover Sir Martin's portrait, which appears at the head of this chapter. I have already expressed a belief that the good man resided in the mansion near the churchyard. The Parochial Almshouses. \u2014 The parochial almshouses in Rope yard Rails are themselves modern, but to get at their origin we must go back two hundred years. It was in 1679 that Sir William Pritchard* gave the ground which they occupy \"for the use of the poor,\" describ in\u00b0* it as \" the ground at the back of Bowes's almshouses.\" Three small tenements appear to have been erected on the site, but in 1731 the trustees were authorised to pull them down and erect a workhouse there instead. Woolwich Workhouse. \u2014 The poorhouse presented in our illustra tion (plate xviii.) was accordingly built, and did its duty for more than a century. In the local act of 1808, previously quoted, authority was given to enlarge the workhouse or build a new one, as the structure was in many parts decayed, and insufficient for thc accommodation and employment of the poor ; but the authority was never exercised, and matters continued in the same way until Woolwich was taken into the Greenwich Union. February 28, 1837. \u2014 A] meeting of the inhabitants in vestry was held to consider the proposal of the Commissioners of the parish regarding the order of the Poor Law Commissioners for uniting Woolwich with Greenwich and Deptford, thereby displac ing the management and control of the poor, and to adopt such measures thereon as will prevent the removal of the poor from Woolwich. The union of the three parishes was vigorously hut vainly opposed, and Woolwich in 1838 sent its representatives to the Greenwich Board of Guardians. The poor people continued at the old workhouse some months longer, and on January 17th, 1839, a letter was received from Mr. Bayly, one of the overseers of Woolwich, which goes to show that the administration was as crude and simple as the building itself. Mr. Bayly informed the Guardians that he had been down to the Woolwich workhouse and seen the aged paupers, for want of knives and forks, \" holding the meat in their hands and tearing it to pieces with their teeth.\" The reply of the Guardians was that \" it was not customary to supply adult paupers with knives and forks.\" Next we read \u2014 February 20, 1839.\u2014 On Saturday tbe women and children in the workhouse ol Woolwich were removed in omnibuses to Greenwich. The scene was heartrending, and great disapprobation was evinced by the multitude. * I have searched for portraits of Sir William Pritchard and other benefactors of old Woolwich, but without success."], [234, "124 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. The End of the Workhouse. \u2014 The male inmates appear to have remained a while longer, but in January, 1841, the building was deserted and \u2014 A suggestion was made by Mr. Thunder at the Board of Commissioners, \"That the workhouse at Woolwich being, from the operation of the new poor law, no longer of service, should be devoted to the wants of the aged and unfortunate, and made an asylum for poverty, wretchedness, and infirmity.\" The Almshouses Started. \u2014 The proposition was heartily adopted, but two years were occupied in raising the necessary funds, and it was not until May 18th, 1843, that the announcement was made that \u2014 On the spot where the old workhouse stood will be erected ten almshouses, and on Friday last the foundation stone was laid by the Rev. W. Greenlaw, rector, assisted by Messrs. Morgan and Jolly, churchwardens, in the presence of a large concourse of the inhabitants. Mr. Clark of Walworth, formerly of Woolwich, materially assisted in the necessary funds. It was stated a week later that \u00a3143 had been raised, of which \u00a31 00 was given by Messrs. Peter and Edward Bossey. Mr. Thomas Clark contributed \u00a3200 towards the almshouses, and also invested \u00a33,000 in Consols for their support. Further, by his will in 1861, he gave \u00a33,000 Consols, equal to \u00a390 a year, to be divided among the inmates annually. In 1847 Miss Anna Joanna Reid, of Woolwich Common, left a legacy of \u00a3400, in the Three per Cents., to the support of the inmates. Schools for the Poor. \u2014 Help also came in from an earlier source. In 1750, Mrs. Anne Withers had left \u00a3100 for the erection of a school house (which was built on part of the old site) and \u00a31,100, invested in Old South-Sea Annuities, to the rector and churchwardens in trust for the maintenance of a schoolmistress for ever, in order to educate thirty poor girls. She also gave the interest of \u00a3400 Government securities to buy bread for the poor, to he given away weekly between 4th October and 27th December, every year. When the National Schools were erected, the teacher's endowment of \u00a31,100 was in due form transferred to them, being still employed for the purpose intended, but in a diverted channel. Its value in 1867 was \u00a31,202, and the income derived from it, \u00a336 ls. 2d. per annum. The schoolhouse in Rope yard Rails was, however, converted into a central almshouse, and its occupants are still elected by the rector and churchwardens, the tenants of the other cottages being chosen by the Local Board of Health, the subscribers, and others. The almshouse funds have since been increased by the care and assiduity of Mr. Morgan and his friends ; and a recent substantial legacy of \u00a32,000, under the will of Dr. Hallifax (formerly of Wool wich), who died at Brighton in October, 1885, has relieved the trustees of their monetary anxieties. Dr. Hallifax was a surgeon at Woolwich,"], [235, "PLATE XVIII. The Goldsmiths' Almshouses in 1835. Woolwich Workhouse, erected 1731, demolished 1842.

A Woolwich Character. \u2014 The following event in connection with Dr. Hallifax was published hy a Brighton paper in 1877 : \u2014 A piece of good fortune has just fallen to the lot of Dr. Hallifax of Brighton. An aged miser, who died a few days since at Woolwich, has left him a legacy of \u00a36,000. The old gentleman, John Clark by name, was a rather singular character. He was eighty-six years of age, and, although he was reputed to be the possessor of a large fortune, he lived to the last in a squalid hovel in the poorest part of AVoolwich,* where, being a man of education, he devoted himself to the accumulation and study of books, of which he leaves a large store. It is said that the front shutters of his house have not been opened for thirty years, and that he never took a regular meal. He did not know the taste of wine or spirits. The value of his estate has not yet been computed, but, from the fact that besides the legacy to Dr. HalUfax, he bequeathes \u00a35,000 to his housekeeper, and various legacies of smaller amount to the local chari ties and to a number of the poor neighbours by whom he was surrounded, it is estimated at between \u00a330,000 and \u00a340,000. Parish Gifts. \u2014 The other parochial charities are the following : \u2014 1575. Sir William Lambarde left one place in Queen Elizabeth's College at Greenwich to be silled from Woolwich for ever. 1621. Richard Sims and Anne his wife gave four small tenements to the poor. By vestry order, August, 1731, three small tenements, probably the same property, were pulled down and the ground let. Annual value, \u00a33. 1622. William Hawkes, formerly minister of Woolwich, devised to the rector and churchwardens, in trust, the rent of one acre of marsh land, situate in the Abbey Level, Plumstead Marshes, and the interest of \u00a327, to be expended in bread for the poor, one shilling's worth every Sunday. 1639. Philip Roberts, by will, dated 24th August, devised an annual rent charge of \u00a31 to be expended in bread for the poor. The sum issued originally out of three small houses in Woolwich, and the charge was confirmed by the Master of the Rolls, 26th April, 1694. The Crown and Masons' Arms public-house stands on the site of the three houses, and the \u00a31 is paid yearly by the owner. 1657. The Rev. Abraham Colfe, vicar of Lewisham, left 8s. Sd. a year for the poor, to be distributed in bread, and gave the rector and churchwardens of Woolwich the right of presentation of three boys to the Free Grammar School endowed by him at Lewisham. 1744. General Joseph Smith, H.E.I.C.S., by will gave \u00a31,000 in trust to the rector and churchwardens for the benefit of the poor. This sum, with interest amount ing to \u00a31,785, was recovered by a suit in Chancery, and is now invested in Three per Cents. The income is laid out in bread for the poor. 1758. Mrs. Mary Wiseman, by will dated 3rd January, left \u00a31,000 Old South Sea Annuities, for educating and clothing six orphan boys, sons of shipwrights.

An account was published in \"Hone's Ever3*day Book \" of November 24th, 1825, from a correspon dent (\" R. R.\"), describing an annual ceremony observed on the evening of St. Clement's Day by the blacksmiths' apprentices of the Dockyard at Woolwich : \u2014 One of the senior apprentices being chosen to serve as Old Clem (so called by them) is attired in a greatcoat, having his head covered with an oakham wig, face masked, and a long white beard flowing therefrom. Thus attired, he seats himself in a large wooden chair, chiefly covered with a sort of stuff called bunting, with a crown and anchor, made of wood, on the top, and around it four transparencies, representinn* \" The Blacksmiths' Anns,\" \" Anchorsmiths at WTork,\" \" Britannia with her Anchor,\" and \" Mount Etna.'' He has before him a wooden anvil, and in his hands a pair of tongs and wooden hammer, which, in general, he makes good use of whilst reciting his speech. A mate, also masked, attends him with a wooden sledge-hammer ; he is also surrounded by a number of other attendants, some of whom carry torches, banners, flags, &c. ; others battle-axes, tomahawks, and other accoutrements of war. This procession, headed by a drum and fife, and six men with old Clem mounted on their shoulders, proceeds round the town, stopping and refreshing at nearly every public house (which, by the by, are pretty numerous), not forgetting to call on the black smiths and officers of the Dockyard. There the money-box is pretty freely handed, after Old Clem and his mate have recited their speeches, which commence by the mate calling for order, with \u2014 \" < lentlemen all, attention give, And wish St. Clem long long to live.\" Old Clem then recites the following speech : \u2014 \" I am the real St. Clement, the first founder of brass, iron, and steel, from the ore. I have been to Mount Etna, where the god Vulcan first built his forge, and forged the armour and thunderbolts fin* the god Jupiter. I have been through the deserts of Arabia ; through Asia, Africa, and America ; through the city of Pongrove ; through the town of Tipmingo ; and all the northern parts of Scotland. I arrived in London on the twenty-third of November, and came down to His Majesty's Dockyard at Wool wich to see bow all the gentlemen came on there. I found them all hard at work. and wish to leave them well on the twenty-fourth.\" The mate then subjoins : \u2014 \" Come all you Vulcans stout and strong, Unto St. Clem we do belong ; I know this house is well prepared AVith plenty of money and good strong beer, And we must drink before we part, All for to cheer each merry heart. his proposal to leave a sum of money to buy milk for the poor, and I persuaded him to give the money to some hospital instead. My suggestion that future inven tion might supersede milk so affected the good and thoughtful old gentleman that he left me \u00a3100 in his will."], [239, "WOOLWICH. 127 Come all you Vulcans, strong and stout, LInto St. Clem I pray turn out ; For now St. Clem's going round the town, His coach and six goes merrily round.

St. Catherine. \u2014 The same correspondent speaks of another custom which has not been so well fostered as that of \" Old Clem,\" whom we saw paraded in a cart, drawn by a horse in place of the six lusty black smiths, only a few years since. He ought to have died with the Dock yard, but he has been kept alive for the sake of the revelry by volunteer successors of the old apprentices. Says the writer aforesaid, in 1825 : \u2014 On the 25th of November, St. Catherine's Day,* a man dressed in woman's clothes with a large wheel by his side, to represent St. Catherine, was brought out of the Koyal Arsenal at Woolwich (by the workmen of that place) about six o'clock in the evening, seated in a large wooden chair, and carried by men round the town, with attendants, &c, similiar to St. Clement's. They stopped at different houses, where they used to recite a speech ; but this ceremony has been discontinued these last eight or nine years. \u2014 R. R. + * I cannot trace any association between the Dockyard and St. Catherine or her wheel, but there was once (about 150 years ago) a tavern named in her honour at Shooters' Hill. The probability is that the shipwrights, after enjoying the festival of St. Clement on Nov. 23rd took to observing St. Catherine's Day (Nov. 25th) as an excuse for renewing the fun. + R. R. was not Richard Ruegg, who in 1825 was but nine years old. i 2"], [240, "CHAPTER XII. STREETS AND PEOPLE. Woolwich Street Names. \u2014 Much of our local history may be read in the names of the streets. Powis Street, the most central and important thoroughfare of modern Woolwich, commenced to exist only at the beginning of this century. It was laid out as part of the Bowater estate purchased by the Powises, a family of brewers at Greenwich, about 1800. The Powis family still hold the property. Thomas Street, William Street, Richard Street (which is now absorbed in Hare Street), and Charles Street were named after members of the Powis family. Eleanor Road and Monk Street have a similar origin, but are of later date (about 1860). Brewer Street commemorates the family trade. Rectory Place, and the streets to the north, were built on the Glebe or Rectory land about 1820. Rectory Grove occupies the garden of Grove House. St. Mary Street was on the Glebe, and is named after the church. Parson's Hill was the hill just opposite the old Parsonage by the river. Mulgrave Place was one of the first streets to appear when the town began to expand in 1810. It bears the name of Earl Mulgrave, the then Master-General of the Ordnance. Wellington Street marks the date of its formation, about 1815-20, when the hero of Waterloo was at the height of his glory. Green's End is the end of the green on which the Sappers drilled. Spray Street was laid out by a Mr. Spray, about 1800 (see Burrage Estate map, under \" Plumstead \"). Helen Street, on the same estate, was named after Miss Helen Pattison. Mill Lane, formerly Cholic Lane, [was the high road to London,* with a mill standing on the eastern side, in the place of the Royal Engineer Office, until about 1860. \" Rose Bank \" adjoined, and Barrack Court occupied the site of the Auxiliary and Female Hospitals about 1850. Cholic Lane bore its old name until 1830. New Road was made about 1790 to connect Plumstead Road with Cholic Lane, the line of traffic having previously been carried round Green's End. * How the ancients came to make the high road from Woolwich to London by such a crooked route we shall probably find out as we proceed, but it may be at once stated that there are good reasons for \"supposing that the highway across Woolwich and Plumstead Commons pre-existed from a very early period, and that the traffic from the town was simply led into it at a right\" angle. The Lower Road was no doubt of older date, and although it seems to have been badly maintained until recent times, its better level would naturally have attracted most of the vehicles."], [241, ""], [242, "Map of Woolwich and Locality, 1778. sTo face page 129.] FLATE XIX."], [243, "WOOLWICH. 129 The White Gate was opposite Barrack Court. The road to this spot from the Barracks was laid out after 1810, when it was only a footpath. Nightingale Place was until 1850 known as \" Ditch water Lane,\" from the brook which ran across it and under the hedges of Brookhill Park. Map of Woolwich and Locality, 1885. Nightingale \\7ale owes its name to the \" feathered choir,\" which made music in the valley. Sandy Hill was a footpath deep in sand until the Board of Commissioners made the road about 1848 upon a tough foundation of faggots. Waterman's Fields is a name which may have been taken from the landowner, but"], [244, "130 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. is more probably a corruption of \" water-fields,\" referring to the watercourse which ran from Brookhill to the river. The houses were built about 1770. BuU Fields may be traced to the tavern at the Arsenal Station. The Bull was one of the first houses built on the site of the old sandpit. Market Street, Upper, and Lower, and Little, remind us of the attempt made by the Board of Commissioners in 1808 to force a market on uncongenial soil. Its site is now occupied by the Town Hall and Police Offices. Union Street and LTnion Gardens are traceable to the old w*orkhouse in Ropeyard Rails. The workhouse was for a time connected with the Greenwich Union, and a passage leading from the gardens was left when Beresford Street was built. But Union Street when completed had a dead end, which was removed with some diffi culty in after years. The Gardens, the name by which the locality is also known, has survived since the spot was cultivated by the cottagers about 1835. Beresford Square, though cleared many years previously of the old cottages which occupied the site, was named after the Marquis of Beresford, Master-General when the new entrance to the Royal Arsenal was formed in 1828-30. Beresford Street was built on the site of the Rope Walk soon afterwards. Ropeyard Rails have borne the name for nearly three hundred years, having occu pied the rear of the Rope Walk. Cannon Row was called \" Ragged Row,\" until the Government set up a number of old guns for posts along the footpath. The parish took up the posts and sold them a generation or two later. Nelson Street, Collingwood Street, and Rodney Street were named in honour ol the admirals of the Nile, Copenhagen, and Trafalgar, 1805. Meeting House Lane led to a little chapel or meeting house which stood in an orchard by the river from 1740 until about 1837. Globe Lane was so called after a now extinct tavern. Cross Street West was made at the same time as New Road, about 1790. Cross Street East and its continuations came into being some years subsequently. Peak's Place is the degenerate tailpiece of primitive Love Lane. Taylor Street was built on land belonging to Mr. Taylor about 1810 (see Burrage Estate map), and wa3 called Taylor's Buildings. The railway bisected it in 1848-9. New Street is a very old street. It w-as called New Street in 1740, when George II. was king. New Street, Kidd Street, was built about 1830. Nile Street was called Hog Lane until about 1860. It is probably the oldest street in Woolwich, and was occupied by shipwrights and other decent people in 1835. It was re-named Nile Street after a tavern at the river end. Hog Lane, Cock Yard, and Dog Yard, are said to have been appurtenances of the great house which stood in the Grove, between High Street and the river, and to mark the sites of the piggery, poultry farm, and kennel. There were also at one time Sow Alley, Pig Court, and Cow Yard adjacent. Hare Street is another of the zoological series. It was a short and narrow cui de sac until it met and united with Richard Street, about 1820. It was widened in 1883. Bell Watergate was named after the Bell, a very old tavern* Glass Yard is a relic of the Huguenots, who are said to have established a glass factory here. Mortgramit Square had a strange conception. It was the joint property of Messrs. * It is asserted that it was at the Bell the captain of the Shannon formed the crew with which he fought the famous battle with the Chesapeake in the American war."], [245, ""], [246, "37.

The hill remains, but the brook and the greensward beside the road disappeared about 1855. Love Lane was in the old time a footpath across fields. It became a cart road, and in the early part of this century it was hedged in, and was so narrow* that the bushes brushed both sides of the carriages. Hill Street did not exist until 1806. The way to Charlton by the Little Heath was previously a mere track over the waste. Wood Street, AVoodville Street, Woodlands Terrace, &c, are all within the ancient boundaries of Hanging AVood. Maryon Road adjacent takes the penultimate name of the AVilson family. Hardin Street and Hardin's Manorw*ay tell of Mr. Hardin, an extensive farmer, whose homestead is now represented by the large house at the Dockyard Gate, for many years occupied by the Commodore-Superintendent. Mr. Hardin's land was partly taken into the Dockyard, but the bulk of it fell to his relatives, the Shersbys, 1 >v whom it was laid out in streets prior to 1850. Harden's Lane, in High Street, was so-called as early at least as 1740. Bowater Crescent is on the site of the park which surrounded the mansion on \" Mount Pleasant,\" the home of the Bowaters and their predecessors. The Bowater Pond on the hill was an ornamental water in the pleasure grounds, but was converted into a reservoir by the Kent Water Company in 1812. Henry and Samuel Streets were named after the Bowaters. Rush Grove was an avenue leading past the great pond to Bowater House. Chapel Street traces its name to the Baptist Chapel near its foot. Ogilby Street is one of a series of roads on a part of the Bowater Park purchased ami laid out by Mr. Ogilby about 1850. Artillery Place was naturally the outgrowth of the Barracks between 1775 and 1820. Very few of the houses were built prior to 1810. Orchard Street will be seen by the old maps to occupy the place of an orchard. Station Road, North Kent Terrace, &c, were laid out when the North Kent Rail way came through in 1848-9. Sand Street leads through an old sandpit, the boundary of wiiich is clearly seen at the upper part near Trafalgar Street. Prospect Row was a narrow path between hedges, and called \"Hedge Row\" all the way to Charlton. Bowling Green Row tells its origin, as do many more ; but the derivation of other names, such as Coleman Street, and Surgeon Street, being remote, can only be conjectured. Angelsea Road, which was built about 1856, was named after the tavern at the corner, which took its title from the famous Marquis, who was Master-General of the Ordnance when it was established in 1846. As the Marquis of Anglesea was in some sense a local celebrity, I may quote a humorous ' ' Epitaph \" written by George Canning on the leg which the hero left buried on the field of AVaterloo. EPITAPH ON THE MARQUIS OF ANGLESEA'S LEG. Here rests \u2014 and let no saucy knave Presume to sneer and laugh, To learn that mouldering in the grave Is laid \u2014 a British calf.

Population. \u2014 It is a remarkable and unquestionable fact that the people of \"Woolwich have gradually and continually increased in number from the earliest time of which we have any data. Before the census came into vogue in 1801, there are no positive records of the popu lation, but we may gather from the registers some approximate ideas on the subject. The rapid growth indicated as these figures approach the end of the last century can hardly fail to be noticed. The same, or proportionate, increase will be found to have taken place at the same period in Plumstead and Charlton, the circumstance being due to an aug mentation of workmen in the Government establishments during the great wars. The number of houses in Woolwich in 1795 was 1,200 ; in 1801, 1,362 ; and in 1810, 1,800.

Water and Dry Laud. \u2014 The proportion of land and water is as follows in acres : \u2014 m acres : \u2014 These totals do not correspond with the average usually given, which merely reckons land and still water. Woolwich is in area a small parish, comprising without the river only 1,126 acres, of which 336 are north of the Thames and 790 on the south. Of this space the Government occupies 360 acres, or nearly one-third. The river frontage (north and south) measures 2,696 yards, of which the Royal Arsenal and Dockyard absorb about 1,600 yards. Increasing and Multiplying. \u2014 There were in the Woolwich Union district, during the ten years 1871-80, 7,228 marriages, 27,559 births, and 15,569 deaths, being an excess of births over deaths of 11,990. The population during the same period increased by 7,465. But, notwithstanding this great number of births, it is certain that the gradual and increasing growth of the population both of Woolwich and its neighbouring parishes has been due largely to immigration, and every increase recorded marks the degree of importance added to the place since the preceding enumeration. Making allowance for the multiplication of inhabitants by birth, there would, under ordinary circumstances, have prevailed the various causes which drain populations and keep the numbers from excessive augmentation ; and it is quite clear, from external actual evidences, that the additions have, at all the times covered by the foregoing figures, been ascribable in a large degree to the influx of strangers. Whence have they come ? We read frequently in the annals of the early Dockyard of shipwrights and others being brought here from distant places, some being foreigners and even prisoners of war ; and when Woolwich became a garrison, the men who settled here from all quarters and reared new families of Woolwich children must have been very many. We have seen much of this in our own time, but it was a cause which operated still more in the olden days, when the conditions of life in the army were so different from those of the present.

Patronage existed a generation or two back to an extent of which we have hardly a conception, and, as a general rule, the smaller the borough the greater was the influence of its parlia mentary representative. In the books of the Ordnance Department, at the Arsenal, it was actually the custom to enroll against every man's name the name of his patron, and it was long proverbial that the two members who sat in the House of Commons for the diminutive town of Queenborough (now disfranchised) had provided places under Govern ment for the sons of the whole constituency. North Britons. \u2014 The natural enterprise and instinct of the northern races on both sides of the Tweed led very many of them in search of fortune to turn their footsteps hither in the early part of the century, and there is much to be traced to the Scotch character in the sober and diligent habits of the people of Woolwich and Plumstead. The Huguenots.- \u2014 A small but interesting importation of French and Flemish blood is ascribed to the Huguenots. When the persecuted Protestants fled from France and Holland in 1554, they nearly all landed at Rye and Sandwich, and spread themselves over Kent and the adjacent counties. They are believed to have established a glass manufactory at Woolwich, in the part of High Street still known as Glass Yard, and the parish registers display several of their names, and a few with the occupation of \" glass-maker \" appended. The following familiar names are found in the roll of the Huguenot families : Delafield, De Grot, Champion, TKTettel, Gerard, Maynard, Raymond, Fleury, Austin, Chamberlayne, TMajendie, Vincent, Pain, Martin, and many more. Some of the foreigners transformed their names thus \u2014 L'Oiseau to Bird, Le Jeune to Young, Du Bois to Wood, La Croix to Ring, Le TMaitre to Masters, Dulau to Waters, Sauvage to Savage or Wild, Touncher to Cooper, and so on ; while others suffered simple cor ruption, Drouet becoming Drewett ; Barre, Barr ; Bouchier, Butcher or Boxer ; Mahieu, Mayhew; Huyghens, Huggens or Higgins; Rerk, Rirk ; Breton, Britton ; De Moulins, Mullins ; Langlois, Langley ; Petit, Pettit ; Reveil, Revill, &c* A curious instance of colonisation is afforded by the case of M.

He liked Woolwich so well that he settled on shore, married, died, and left a numerous progeny of Woolwich worthies. Railway Men. \u2014 More recently there has been a health}** introduction of railwaymen \u2014 guards and engine-drivers, and such honest folk \u2014 at Plumstead. This class is one of the best specimens of the British artisan, and the future people of Plumstead will be all the better for the mixture of so excellent an ingredient. Siemens' Telegraph Works. \u2014 So much ofthe space, and so much of the local labour, have been absorbed by the Government works that there has been little les t for private enterprise. But a piece of good fortune fell to the share of Woolwich and its neighbours when the high class industry known to all the world as Siemens Brothers' Telegraph Works came to be established just on the Charlton boundary. This was in 1860, not long after the shipbuilders and anchorsmiths were driven from the Dockyard, and the employment which the twin sciences of telegraphy and electricity have ever since afforded has been of the utmost service in providing as residents of the district a superior order of mechanics and an advanced rank of scientific men. In 1857 the firm commenced its English enterprise (as a branch of the Berlin house ) at Millbank, where a workshop was taken at the corner of Holywell Street, merely for the repairs of telegraph instruments, under the name of Siemens, Halske & Co. Increase of business necessitated larger premises, and the extortionate charges of the then existing \" Cable-ring \" compelled Messrs. Siemens to set up machinery for themselves in opposition to the clique. In 1860 they put their feet down on the spot where their great factory has since grown up, starting with a small building next the Warspite bathing-place, at the river corner of Hardin's Mauorway. The buildings now cover six and a half acres. The old firm at Berlin has always retained its association with the English business, but on the retirement of Mr. Halske, this branch became known as \" Siemens Brothers,\" the brothers being Werner, Carl, and William. Still later, in consequence of Mr. Ludwig Loeffler, the manager, entering into partnership, the title of the firm was changed to that which it now bears, \"Siemens Brothers & Co., Limited.\" Sir William Siemens. \u2014 Sir William Siemens, the most distin guished of the four brothers (Werner, Wilhelm, Carl, and Friedrich), was born in Hanover, April 4th, 1823, and came to England in 1842 (then a mere student), to introduce a method of gilding by galvanic deposit invented by his brother, Dr. Werner Siemens. After returning for a time to Germany he decided in 1844 upon remaining in England, and in 1850 he became a naturalized subject of the Queen.

Woolwich Postal District. \u2014 The changes which have come over Woolwich and the neighbourhood during the last forty years is well illustrated by the postal service. In 1850 there were but eight post men employed in the delivery of letters at Woolwich, Plumstead, Shooters' Hill, and New Charlton, where now ( 1888 ) fifty-four men are required for the work. There were then only three places at Woolwich and one at Plumstead where letters could be posted ; there are now in Woolwich twenty-five and in Plumstead eighteen. In 1850 the conveyance of country letters was so uncertain that the time of first delivery was frequently 12.30 and 1 p.m., whereas we get our country post at the present time between 8 and 9 a.m. Mr. George John Lockwood was appointed postmaster at Woolwich in 1874, at which time the locality was for a short period in the London S.E. district ; but in April, 1875, it was formed into a separate division and known as the Woolwich Postal District. The Great Exhibition of 1851.\u2014 On June 8th, 1850, a meeting, which was probably the largest ever held within a building at Woolwich, took place in the Royal Artillery Riding School in support ofthe Great Exhibition ofthe Works of Industry of all Nations, 1851. Galleries were erected by Mr. G. H. Graham and Mr. J. Tricket, and two thousand persons were seated. General Sir Thomas Downman presided, and K"], [258, "142 RECORDS OF THE TfOOLWICH DISTRICT. addresses were delivered by Commodore Eden, R.N., Colonel Reid, R.E., the Rev. A. De La Mare, the Rev. Dr. Carlisle, Messrs. R. Ruegg, D. W. Wire, F. Bossey, and others. Mr. T. R. Richardson spoke for the Dockyard workmen, and Mr. (afterwards Sir) J. Anderson for the Royal Arsenal. It was a very loyal, hearty, and enthusiastic meeting. Banking. \u2014 It is neither to be expected nor desired that we should essay to trace the source of all the trade and enterprise which the growth and prosperity of Woolwich have attracted to it, but it may be noted with satisfaction how large a proportion of its commercial men are native-born and members of its old-established families. An excep tion may be made in the case of the banking interest, which is to some extent national rather than local. Woolwich Banks. \u2014 The earliest \"Woolwich bank\" of which we have any notice was a private concern known first as \"Nokes and Ward \" and then as \" Budgen, Ward, and Co.,\" and was held at the house in Rectory Place now occupied by Mr. T. H. Jones, and known as Glebe House. Mr. Budgen resided at the Manor House next Plumstead Church, and was churchwarden of Plumstead. The bank stopped pay ment in November, 1836, and the failure caused great excitement and distress, as the townspeople had reposed absolute confidence in its security. The loss amounted to \u00a37,000, the available assets, which were also \u00a37,000, being barely half sufficient to meet the liabilities. London and County. \u2014 Thereupon the \"Surrey, Rent, and Sussex Bank\" came to the help of the town, and soon afterwards changed its title to that of the \"London and County Bank,\" under which it has well served the population for more than fifty years. At first its estab lishment was on the north-east corner of William Street, where is now a chemist's shop, but it moved across the road about 1850 to an old pawn shop (formerly occupied by Mr. Lewis Davis), and on that site the pre sent substantial building was erected in 1867. The local managers within my recollection have been Mr. Grugeon, Mr. Gates, and the pre sent head, Mr. R. Rabson. London and Provincial. \u2014 In the year 1873, as the population grew, a second banking establishment was started in Beresford Square, by the Metropolitan and Provincial Bank (afterwards Metropolitan only), Mr. J. T. Drake having the management. This effort gave place in 1873 to the London and Provincial Bank, which, with Mr. Drake as its manager, opened a branch at 38, Green's End, from whence it was removed to the corner of Wellington Street and Thomas Street in 1879. Mr. Drake retired in 1887, and was succeeded by Mr. W. H. Lewis. Capital and Counties.\u2014 The Capital and Counties Bank opened a"], [259, "143 WOOLWICH. branch at Woolwich on August lst 1876*, occupying the premises in Beresford Square formerly held by the Metropolitan, and having for its manager Mr. W. Bryan. In 1875 the same premises were temporarily occupied by a fraudulent concern called \" The Co-operative Bank,\" which promised 18 per cent. on deposits, and collapsed in January, 1876. The Savings Bank. \u2014 A good record must be given to the old Woolwich and Plumstead Savings Bank, which helped the humble fru gality of the poorer inhabitants for more than half a century \u2014 from 1816 until 1868 \u2014 when, on May 16, it was honourably dissolved, the establishment of Post Office Savings Banks having removed the motive of its existence. It was located at the western end of Powis Street, and its offices are now in possession of the Odd-Fellows of the Woolwich District. Breach of Trust. \u2014 Not uneventful, however, was the life of the Woolwich and Plumstead Savings Bank, for it experienced a severe blow in 1834 by the defalcations of its secretary. Circumstances having led me to investigate this matter, I give the following report : \u2014 Nov. lst, 1834. \u2014 During the last fortnight the directors and trustees of the Woolwich and Plumstead Savings Bank have been engaged in examining the books of that institution, in consequence of the discovery of a fraud on the part of the actuary, Mr. William Gloag, a person of very respectable connections, who was appointed to that situation through the interest of Sir John Webb, Director-General of the Medical Department at Woolwich ; and it is stated that an embezzlement of its funds has been carried on to a very considerable extent, though there is every reason to believe that the depositors will not be eventually the losers. Much consternation has prevailed, however, among that class of persons ; and for the purpose as far as possible of relieving their fears, a public examination yesterday took place of Mr. Gloag before the magistrates at Woolwich, before whom he has undergone three several private examinations. About twelve o'clock, Adam Young, Esq., chairman, sat at the bench, assisted by Mr. John Wray. The Rev. Dr. Watson and Mr. AV. Stacey were also present. Long before the opening of the court the seat behind the bench was occupied by several of the most respectable inhabitants of the neighbourhood, while the part in front ofthe magistrates devoted to the public was crowded to excess. Near one o'clock the prisoner, dressed in a suit of black, was placed at the bar. The charge against the prisoner was for embezzling i'243 6s. -lid., moneys said to have been lodged in the bank on account of Sarah Jones. As the depositions of the witnesses were taken at the private examination of the prisoner they were read by Mr. Smith, jun., and the witnesses were respectively sworn. The statement ol several witnesses who had examined the books belonging to the bank were then gone through at some length, from which it appeared that the sum of i243 13s. 2id. with interest had been paid out to a depositor named Sarah Jones : but it turned out that no such payment had been made. It appeared that the prisoner * Preceded for a short period by the Hampshire Bank, which followed hither the 5th (Northumberland) Fusiliers. K 2"], [260, "144 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. had acknowledged his guilt, and that he had been embezzling the money of the bank for a long time. The chairman then observed that the period had arrived when it became his duty to give the result of the investigation. All the depositions had been read, and from them he was quite satisfied that there was sufficient evidence (in which view his brother magistrates concurred) to send him to Maidstone, there to take his trial on the charges brought against him. The witnesses were bound over, in subscribing to which obligation Sir John Webb was conspicuously affected. Sir John Webb addressed the persons in the court, stating that seven gentlemen, directors of the bank, had been engaged several days in examining the books, and that as soon as the accounts are looked into a public meeting would be called of all the depositors, when a statement of the accounts would be laid before them. Much delay had been caused from the depositors not having brought in their books. He had no doubt that a satisfactory statement would be made. The prisoner was then removed from the bar, in custody of Campion the officer. Campion was called back, and in answer to questions from Sir John Webb, he said that since he had had the prisoner in his custody he had placed him in the cage. He was always with him, and no magistrate, either directly or indirectly, had had communication with him. The chairman then directed Campion to take the prisoner instantly to Maidstone, as in consequence of the new criminal court law coming into operation this day some demur might arise. The prisoner was immediately conveyed to Maidstone, where he was tried at the following county assizes, and sentenced to transportation for life. A part of the convict's sentence was served on board the hulks at Woolwich. Strange Panic. \u2014 The trustees had another alarm in the later days of the bank, arising from a curious panic, which had no other founda tion than a stupid rumour. The story went from mouth to mouth that \" the Bank \" was \" closed.\" It was speedily traced to the circumstance of a beer-house known as \" The Bank \" in High Street (now \" The Coat and Badge \") having put up its shutters, but it created a smart run upon the Savings Bank and upon the other banking establishments likewise. Another \"Respectable\" Felon. \u2014 In the same year that Gloag was tried, Woolwich had an earlier sensation. On March 15th, 1834, Thomas Gorham, solicitor, aged thirty-six, was tried at Maid stone for forging a bill of exchange with intent to defraud Mr. George Hudson of \u00a350. Mr. Hudson said he was a solicitor at Woolwich. Prisoner owed him \u00a328 and paid him with the bill produced, which purported to be drawn by Mr. Shrubsole, grocer, Sheerness. He cashed it at the bank of Messrs. Nokes and Ward, Woolwich. Mr. Nokes, solicitor and banker, said the prisoner had served his articles with him. The bill was in the prisoner's handwriting. The prisoner, who feigned insanity, and asked for \" Mary,\" was sentenced to transportation for life. There were three or four other indictments against the prisoner, which in consequence of this conviction were not brought on."], [261, ""], [262, "View of Woolwich in 1698, showing the ancient Church, the Dockyard, and Dock-rails.

It may, indeed, be asserted that throughout our land the village church is honoured with the best position in the village ; and so much of the lives and interests of our ancestors were centred there that, generally speaking, the history of the parish church may be regarded as the history of the parish. This is true in a large measure of Woolwich, especially in the primitive period which preceded the birth of the Dockyard ; and yet there is so much of our local annals associated distinctly and inseparately with the church and churchyard that I have felt bound to divide their records from the rest, and to devote to this particular theme its own particular chapters. A Thousand Years. \u2014 It is almost beyond doubt that this spot has been the site of a church for at least a thousand years. The present"], [264, "146 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. structure was built only in 1735, but it replaced a former one which was said to have been very ancient. Three representations of the earlier church are known to exist, and I have copies of all three in this work. The first in order of date is the drawing made in 1662 by Jonas Moore, and appears on Plate VII. ; the second is that which is given here, is thirty-six years later, and on a clearer scale ; and the third is the excellent view of 1739, which appears on Plate IV., and shows the old edifice and it successor standing on the hill together. The site of the older sanctuary w*as on the north side of the Church Hill footpath. The tombs of Henry Maudslay and Timothy Church now occupy part of the precise spot. At what period this former church was built no one can say, but the church chronicles go back to a.d. 400, and it is possible that it may have stood there from the first introduction of Christianity to this corner of Rent. Its appearance betokens a primitive construction, and other similar churches are still in existence which trace their origin to the early Saxons, and even to the Romans. There is no mention of its ever having been rebuilt prior to 1735, and no trace has ever been dis covered of a previous building, but it may nevertheless have been several times erected on the same site. At the Conquest. \u2014 Distinct references to the church are found as far back as the Xormans, for it is declared to have been given by William the Conqueror's son, Henry I., to the Priory and monks of Rochester about the year 1100, with all the tithes belonging to it, for the good of the souls of his parents, himself, and his wife. Bishop Gundulph, who was at that time head of the see of Rochester, in separating his own maintenance from that of the monks, gave them Woolwich for their support, and granted them the free disposal of the vicarage. Except for a short interval* the parish has remained in the diocese of Rochester ever since. About 1190, however, Bishop Gilbert de Glanville, who succeeded Gundulph, held that the see had been im poverished by extravagance, and divested the monks of the church and tithes, but allowed them to receive a yearly donation of seven shillings out of the profits which had always been paid by the parishioners to their mother church. This seven shillings a year has been paid ever since to the Dean and Chapter of Rochester, and is paid still. The Ancient Fabric. \u2014 It is not difficult to credit the church with an existence of one thousand years when we have a list of the rectors, obtained from the archives of the diocese, which goes back with some interruption more than seven hundred years. One of them, William Prene, is said to have founded a chapel in connection with the * The parish of St. Mary Magdalen, Woolwich, was transferred to the London diocese August 20th, 1845, but prospectively restored to the diocese of Rochester by 26 and 27 Vic., c. 36 (1863-4)."], [265, "147 WOOLWICH. church (probably the second aisle) and given the belfry to it. He was buried in the old church in 1464. The most ancient monument of which we have any notice is that of one John Colin and wife, men tioned by \"Weever as having died in 1397. But the memorial had disappeared before Harris wrote in 1719, and the old church itself went twenty years later.* Edward VI.'s Schedule. \u2014 We have, moreover, some testimony as to the church bells in an inventory of Woolwich Church taken in the reign of Edward VI. and dated 1552, which is still in existence. This is signed by Richard Billyng, curate ; Robert Parker and William Clarke, churchwardens ; and states that the church property consisted of \"two chalaces of silver weying 8 oz ., one Bible with I'araphrasis of Erasmus, one newe booke of the newe ordre of service, and one candlestick of latton, t three bells of bell mettell suted hanging in the steple there, and one little saint's bell of brass hanging in the said steple.\" There is a memorandum attached to explain that one other chalice mentioned in a previous inventory \" remaineth in possession of Robert Cokks, bere brewer,\" and \" one little crown of silver in the pos session of Nicholas Boughton, Esq., J executor unto Sir Edward Bough ton, knight.\" It is also noted that \"one pix\u00a7 of silver, three latten candle-sticks,\" and some vestments are to be sold for the \"reparations ofthe church,\" and that some other things had been stolen. The Church Bells. \u2014 To finish with the bells, I ought to say here that I have inherited from the late Mr. B. Wells his belief that the present church had originally either four or six bells, and that they were in earlier times the occupants of the older belfry. '-About 1810 a London founder gave the present eight bells in exchange for the old ones, and Mr. Wells says that his father was present at the inaugural ringing and subsequent supper. The Titular Saint. \u2014 The parish was formerly dedicated to St. Lawrence, but this was altered four hundred and fifty years ago. The motive for the change was an agricultural one, showing the extent to which the farming interest prevailed in the early days. It had been customaiy to hold the feast of the Dedication on August 9th, the eve of * Weever's record dates from 1631, and is as follows : \u2014 \"Woolwich \u2014 Orate pro amina Johannis Colin et Mathilde vxoris eius : qui Johannis obiit 27 Januar .... and Mathilda 25 Octob. 1397. \"Hic iacet Dominus Will.

St. Lawrence, but in seasons of bad harvest this frequently happened to be a day of fasting and abstinence. So inconsistent an interruption of a joyful celebration was annoying to the good yeomen of Woolwich, and they petitioned their bishop to find them a more convenient saint. Accordingly, on the lst of September, 1429, the Bishop of Rochester made a decree by which he transferred the festival to the 5th of October, which does not appear to be any saint's day in particular, and at some later time, probably when the church was rebuilt, the daj* was again changed to July the 22nd, which is the feast of St. Mary Magdalen, and remains the accepted anniversary in our day and generation. St. Margaret's, Woolwich. \u2014 Mention in an old diary (1610) of \" the bell-ringers at St. Margaret's, Woolwich,\"* has led me to make some inquiries, but I can find no other evidence that the church has ever borne any name beyond those authoritatively assigned to it, St. Lawrence and St. Mary- The festival of St. Margaret in the Church calendar is on July 20th, two days prior to the feast of St. Mary Magdalen. The diarist probably made a mistake. At the Dissolution. \u2014 The tribute of seven shillings a year just mentioned was seized by Henry VIII., with the rest of the revenues of St. Andrew's, Rochester, at the Dissolution, but the Ring in 1541 settled the income upon his new Dean and Chapter of Rochester. In 1288 the value of the church was assessed at ten marcs, but in Henry VIII.'s inventory it is put down at \u00a37 12s. 5d., with 15s. 3d. added for the \"yearly tenth.\" In 1650 the church living was described as \"a parsonage with a house and some glebe lands, worth \u00a355 per annum,\" Master William Hawkes being the rector. The ancient church, as will be seen from the illustrations, consisted of two aisles only, and had a square tower. The tower, according to Queen Elizabeth's view of the Thames, 1588, was at that time surmounted by a spire, but this may have been a mere fiction of the draughtsman, inserted for the purpose of indicating more clearly the character of the building. In the earliest reliable view of Woolwich, that of Jonas Moore, 1662, (Plate VII.) there is no spire. A Decrepit Old Age. \u2014Soon after 1700 the inhabitants appear to have grown anxious about their church, which was very much decayed, and in great peril, consequent on the shifting soil of the sand hill upon which it stood. As the hill had been worked for ballast on the river face hundreds of years before, t the danger from this source * See Dockyard, Pett's Diary, Feb. lst, 1610. t A letter of licence written in Norman French and dated 1413 gives to certain \"dear and well-beloved \" persons, described as common labourers in boats called \" lyghters,\" bringing victuals to the City, full power to dig and take sand and gravel for ballast from both sides of the Thames without making \"payment to anyone for the same, so always that they do no damage to the \" walks \" or embankments of the river."], [267, "149 WOOLWICH. must have been constant and imminent from generation to generation, but the edifice had the advantage of being soundly constructed. It was, as we see, strongly buttressed, and, although its materials were but flints and chalk, it had stood from unrecorded time, a monument of credit to the early builders. Spenser's lines aptly describe the old church : It was a goodly heap for to behold Ami spake the praises ofthe workman's wit. And lull great pity that so fair a mould Did on so weak foundation ever sit ; For on a sandy hill, that still did flit And fall away, it mounted was on high That every breath of Heaven shaketh it. An Interesting Petition. \u2014 Furthermore, the church was too small for the increasing population, and the very limited graveyard must even then have been fully occupied. The following document, printed on a sheet apparently for circulation and dated 1718, is preserved among the unique curiosities in the inner sanctuary of the British Museum. Woolwich Church is situated on the top of a sandy hill, almost perpendicular, forty-three feet high from the cartroad of the highway, and but thirty-two feet si aitli from the edge of the said hill. The fence of the church is on the edge of the said hill and is mostly undermined ; above sixty loads of the surface of the earth having slid and been washed down the hill within these three months last past, and several bones of dead bodies have been seen sliding down with the sand into the common cartroad, which increases the danger of its foundation and very much lessens the burial place. The inhabitants have it as a tradition that the said church is near one thousand three hundred years old, the foundation of which is rotten and mouldering ; the wood work, especially its roof, is so rotten that it cannot be repaired ; some part whereof about eight years since sunk and gave such a crack when it was full of the inhabitants, which put them into a very great consternation, insomuch that many were trampled under foot and bur' n crowding to get out of the church. There is near one rVusand families belonging to the Navy Dockyard and Ropeyard, two hundred families belonging to the Ordnance service, and about one hundred independent of either, which, after the rate of five to each family, is six thousand five hundred, and the said old church cannot at most contain above six hundred people. All which reasons prove the necessity of building a new church and moving the situation of it farther south, as well as the present churchyard being small and already very full, and the parish very populous and daily increasing, there is not room for burying the dead. To which may be added that the poor's rates has been for several years past 3s. in the pound, never less than 2s. 3d., a heavy tax for poor labouring men to pay, which makes them wholly unable to contribute more than they have done towards rebuilding the said church. The estimate of the charge for the rebuilding the said church, being proposed to be done with the utmost frugality, amounted to (before the inhabitants increased to the present number) upwards of the sum of \u00a35,069 0 0 From whence abating what has been collected by virtue of the brief the sum of 1,141 3 11 The sum wanted to rebuild the church according to the above-said estimate is upwards of 3,927 16 1"], [268, "150 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Collecting Funds. \u2014 The inhabitants had, before the death of Queen Anne (which took place in 1714), obtained letters patent for collecting this needful sum of \u00a35,069, and Dr. Lindsay, the former rector, at that time Lord Primate of Ireland, with other friends of the church, gave \u00a3380 14s. 8d. towards it. Seven years prior to the rebuilding (i.e. 1726), a piece of ground measuring one and a half acres was obtained for enlarging the churchyard, and upon this the site of the new church was fixed. Previously the whole enclosure, church and churchyard, were on the north of the footpath which passes from High Street to Church Street. The added ground was purchased from Richard and John Bowater, bricks were made and a foundation laid down, and upon these preliminaries a sum of \u00a3746 17s. 8d. was expended. A Windfall. \u2014 The balance left had slightly improved by invest ment in the public funds, but in 1731 the whole sum available was \u00a31,230 in joint stock of South Sea annuities, an amount so far short of requirements that the promoters of the pious work became sorely troubled in their minds, when, to their great relief, an Act of Parlia ment was passed in 1732 for rebuilding Woolwich Church as one of fifty ordered to be built by the previous statute of Anne, cap. 2, and assigning \u00a33,000 towards the cost from certain funds and revenues set apart for the purpose. Another Check. \u2014 With good heart the parishioners then went to work, and built the body and tower and roofed all in, when they found themselves again involved, for they had spent all their money, and required \u00a31,000 to finish the undertaking. Another Windfall. \u2014 Some years elapsed without anything being done, but a vestry meeting was held on Sunday, the 25th of February, 1738, and the will of a good friend, Daniel Wiseman, Esq., was dis cussed. He was a dockyard official, and had held a good position at Deptford, but he had an affectionate remembrance of his earlier service at Woolwich, and not only ordained that at his death his body should be buried in the churchyard here, but devised a plan by which, without wronging his rightful kindred, he might help the completion of the church. Falling in with his scheme, the vestry at once resolved to petition Parliament for an act to give it virtue, and accordingly a measure was passed in 1739 for \" applying a sum of money given by the will of Daniel Wiseman, Esq., deceased, for finishing the church at Woolwich, and by raising an annuity chargeable on the parish rates.\" The pre amble to this act sets forth : \u2014 Whereas the sum of three thousand pounds granted out the coal dues by the pre-"], [269, "WOOLWICH. 151 vious act and the money raised by collections has been expended and a substantial church built and covered in, but no further progress made towards the finishing of it for divine service, and whereas Daniel Wiseman, one of the trustees, made his last will bearing date the 26th of November, 1736, and directed that in case at the time of his decease the parish church lately built at Woolwich should not be completely finished and fit for divine service, then his wife, Mary Wiseman, whom he made sole executrix of his will, should pay or advance to the minister, churchwardens, and principal inhabitants of the parish of Woolwich, such sum or sums of money out of the residue of his personal estate as should, by able, good, and honest workmen, be found wanting and necessary for completing the works of the said new church, not exceeding in the whole the sum of one thousand pounds, on conditions that the said one thousand pounds be paid only after the decease of his wife, Mary Wiseman, and her mother, Elizabeth Crouch, and not before, unless the rector or minister, church wardens, overseers of the poor, and other principal inhabitants of Woolwich would sign their bond, to pay interest at five per cent, until their deaths ; and whereas an estimate has been made of the expenses that will attend the finishing the said church, amount ing to \u00a393S 17s. 5d. , and whereas the parishioners of the parish of Woolwich, who are very poor, and chiefly consist of artificers and labourers employed in His Majesty's dock and yards, are unable to raise the money, and so long as the same remains unfinished will be destitute of a place of public divine worship ; and whereas the said Mary Wiseman and Elizabeth Crouch are willing that the said sum of one thousand pounds should be immediately applied, pursuant and according to the pious intention of the donor, so as an annuity equivalent to the interest may be effectually secured to them ; be it therefore enacted, &c.

Memorials. \u2014 There is more to be said before we quit this interest ing spot. The inner walls of the church support a number of memorial tablets. Over the chancel there are the following : \u2014 The Rev. Hugh Fraser, thirty-two years rector, who died on the 4th of April, 1837, in his seventy-third year ; the Rev. William Greenlaw, died 22nd December, 1850, in his seventieth year ; Major James Pattison Adye, died 1831 ; and Major-General Stephen Galway Adye, died 1836. A memorial to Mr. Greenlaw's two sons, who were both deprived of life by similar accidents in 1841 and 1845, is near the chancel. The story of the terrible fever on board H.M.S. Eclair in 1845 is perpetuated in a marble tablet erected by the survivors ; and amongst other inscriptions we read of John Mends, Esq.. many years resident in this town, who died in 1821, and his son Tucker Mends, who fell at Algiers when eighteen years of age ; of Major-General Sir John Boscawen Savage, colonel-commandant Royal Marines, and \" Dame \" Sophia his wife, both of whom died in 1843 ; of Lieutenant-Colonel Belford, R.A., died 1841 ; Lieutenant-Colonel H.

Mr. Daniel Wiseman, who had served in Woolwich Dockyard, and been raised to the office of clerk of the cheque at Deptford, has a handsome memorial at the east end of the south gallery, befitting so good a benefactor of the church ; and opposite to it is the record of the Barnards, showing that Joel Barnard, attorney, was for many years vestry clerk of both Woolwich and Plumstead, and died in 1758 ; that John, his son, was \" thirty years clerk in the master intendant's office at Woolwich Yard ;\" and that Ann Barnard, Joel's daughter, who died in 1765, at the age of thirty-four, was \"a dutiful and affectionate child and sister, pleasing in person and manners, and very ingenious in the useful accomplishments of her sex.\""], [278, "156 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT.

There is a stone to the memory of Sergeant James Knight, R.A., who died in 1818, age seventy six, erected by General Sir Thomas Downman, Commandant of Woolwich Garrison, General Sir Hew D. Ross, D.A.G., and the officers of the Royal Artillery, in honour of \u25a0\u25a0 a faithful old soldier who was first clerk in the Commandant's office for the long period of fifty years.'' In another part of the ground is a massive tomb over the grave of Sergeant-Major Shepherd, R.A., who was assassinated under circumstances related elsewhere. Atthe north-west corner ofthe church is a neat tomb erected by the Royal Marine Band, Woolwich division, to their comrade George Wilson, who died in 1853 ; and near the north-east end is a stone in memory of Sergeant-Major Fleming, died 1843, erected by the non-commissioned officers and men of the 9th Battalion R.A., he having been their sergeant-major for eighteen years. Lieutenant William Robe, who was fifty-nine vears in the artillery, and thirty years proof-master, died 1814, age eighty-one, and has a grave near the High Street entrance ; and on the same side of the ground is the tomb of Mr. Thomas Walton, who is described as having been sixty two years in the ordnance service and the inventor of instruments used in examining cannon. He died in 1830, aged eighty-four. Lewis's Topography says : \u2014 In Woolwich churchyard is the monument of Lieutenant-General Williamson, whose wife is lineally descended from Richard, king of Scotland. * There are several stately monuments from which the inscriptions have entirely disappeared, while others are kept in preservation with evident care. The one which is clearly the subject of most attention is that of Mrs. Anne Withers, that eminent benefactress of the parish ; and another which has preserved itself with remarkable endurance is that of a still more eminent friend of the church, Daniel Wiseman, Esq., who died in 1738. The inscription on the stone cover of his vault is so perfect as to induce a belief that it has been renewed at some more recent date in gratitude for the favours which he rendered the church at its rebuilding. The tomb of John Nelson, Esq., master shipwright of Chatham Dockyard, which is adjacent, is one of many evidences of the connection which existed between Woolwich and the sister yards during the last century. Though conspicuously placed at the south-west corner of the church and of handsome proportions, the tomb of Mr. Samuel Hardin modestly speaks of him (who was the founder of a rich and broad estate) as a \" farmer and gardener,\" but commends his charity, good manners, his virtue, and piety. He died * Colonel Adam Williamson, their only son, married Anne, daughter of Thomas Jones, Esq., of East Wickham."], [279, "157 WOOLWICH. in 1803, aged eighty years.

Of historical interest may also be the brief tale of heroism fast vanishing from the gravestone of Mr. William Sharp, of Woolwich, who \" while attempting to save the lives of two of his fellow-creatures, was himself unfortunately suffocated, January 26, 1797, in the thirty-fifth year of his age.\" Charles Loe has a cenotaph which tells his tragic end at the age of twenty, in 1825.

There are two stones which appear to have been put up solely to remind the sexton that their owners paid, the one \u00a310 and the other \u00a320, into the Savings Bank that he might have the interest as his reward for keeping their graves in order. The church books also show that Mr. Loat left \u00a3100 consols by will, proved November 13, 1853, the interest to be expended on bread for the poor and on the repairs of his tomb. Mr. Hardin left \u00a3105 Three per Cents, for repair of his tomb ; and Mr. Fraser similarly left \u00a321 10s. 2d. in 1855. Toleration in the Grave. \u2014 In close proximity to Parson's Hill Baptist Chapel is a pronounced Roman Catholic inscription, in which the reader is besought to \" pray for the soul \" of a lady who died in 1843, during the rectorate of the Rev.

Dock Rails.\u2014 As the high boundary wall which supports the steep side of the church yard on the north has been erected at a comparatively re cent date, the task of preserv ing this portion of the church yard has necessarily been a source of trouble to the church wardens through all recorded time. It is mentioned in the petition (page 149) as one of the reasons for rebuilding the church, and it has been the subject of many appeals to the Government. It is probable that the river washed the base Tom Cribb, 1805. of the acclivity at high tides, and an anchor was once dug up close to it,f but it is certain that at one time the hill sloped down to the shore, and it must be assumed that so long as Woolwich has existed the road which now takes the form of Dock Rails ran by the water's edge. The probability, however, has just been pointed out that in the early * Fistiana's record of Tom Cribb's \" war services \" is as follows : \u2014 Born at Hanham, Gloucester, July 8, 1781 ; weight, fourteen stone three pounds (champion and presented with a belt) ; beat Maddox, near Highgate, Jan. 7, 1805 ; beat Tom Blake at Blaekheath, February 13, 1805 ; beat Ikey Pig at Blaekheath, May 21, 1805 ; beaten by George Nicholls ; beat Richmond at Hailsham, October 8, 1805 ; beat Jem Belcher, two hundred pounds a side, at Moulsey, April 8, 1807 ; beat Horton, October 25, 1808 ; beat Jem Belcher, two hundred pound, at Epsom, February 1, 1809 ; beat Molyneux (the black), two hundred pound a side and one hundred pound, Copt hall Common, December 10, 1810 ; beat Molyneux, six hundred pound a side, at Leicester, September 28, 1811 (presented with a cup, value eighty guineas) ; beat Carter (room turn-up), Oxenden Street, February 1, 1820.

Tom Griffiths, who is buried close to Cribb, has five pitched battles to his record, in the last of which he was killed by his antagonist, Paddy Gill.

In the illustration at the beginning of this chapter (Plate XX.), which is found in an Admiralty survey made in 1698, the \"dock rails,\" which gave to this spot the name it still bears, are shown as they stood at that time when the river bank was an open promenade. In euch circumstances it is more than possible that tbe tide invaded and damaged the road and its slight embankment. Repairs, \u2014 -Among the State Papers of the reign of Charles I. there is the following report : \u2014 July 3, 1633. \u2014 From Edward Boate and F. Sheldon to the officers of the navy: \u2014 \" The highway leading from the town of Woolwich to the timber yard and'dock is very ruinous, and prejudicial to the King's service by stopping land carriage that way, and endangering the lives of those that are employed in his Majesty's works. They recommend that out of waste and unserviceable timber the officers should allot a proportion towards the repair thereof.\" The appeal was ineffectual, and shortly afterwards, when King Charles paid a visit to Woolwich, the inhabitants thought the opportunity might be turned to account by presenting bis Majesty with a petition on the subject. The King accepted the petition, but he had other matters to think of, and the road was still neglected nearly a year after wards. Then a determined remonstrance was made to the Board of Admiralty in a memorial from the inhabitants to the following effect : \u2014 June 17, 1634. \u2014 Petitioners have for a long time been suitors for relief towards repair of a highway from Woolwich to Greenwich, which being formerly preserved by a timber wharf is now by the violence of the river quite decayed, so that the lives of passengers are endangered, the parish church is in hazard speedily to fall, and the bones of the dead are washed out of the churchyard into the river. The Lords formerly recommended the same to certain commissioners, but they found the road in question to lie a parish wa}*, belonging to petitioners. Petitioners also make humble suit to the King, in respect that by this way all provisions and land carriages are conveyed to the timber yard and dock. The King promised relief, but petitioners, not being able to hear anything of their petition since it was presented last year at Woolwich, and being themselves poor labouring men, relieved by his Majesty's works, now pray for an allotment of unserviceable timber out of his Majesty's yard towards the furtherance of this work. Annexed is a paper signed by the Bishop of Rochester and two others to the Justices of Assize for Kent, certifying that the required repairs would cost \u00a3200, and the parishioners are not able to expend that sum. There is also a report (June 25, 1634) from the master shipwright of the Dockyard, Phineas Pett, showing that during his employment at Woolwich in building the Prince Royal and Merhonour there had been twice allowed a proportion of waste timber for the repair of the highway leading from the town to the dockyard. l 2"], [282, "160 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Faced by such precedents and backed by such authorities, the appli cation was entirely successful, and the Lords of the Admiralty at once resolved to support so good a work. The timber was granted, the land slipping of the churchyard hill was stayed, the roadway was mended, and the retaining fence which supported the dock rails on the water front was put in order. Indeed these repairs were done and continued, not only during the reign of King Charles the First, but also under the strict rule of the Commonwealth, for in 1650 Cromwell and the Council of State are reported to have repaired with waste timber from the State's dockyard a wharf leading thereto, 553 feet long and six feet deep, on petition from the inhabitants of Woolwich, who complained that no one could pass it without fear, and that it endangered the falling down ofthe church. Scandal, however, naturally arose from so questionable a practice, insomuch that it became necessary in 1663 for Christopher Pett, who was then master shipwright, to send a letter to the Navy Commissioners, informing them that a certain report which alleged that the stones bestowed upon the parish had been offered for sale was utterly false and unfounded. The truth he declared was that these said stones would he of essential service to the King (Charles II.) in mending the road from the \" Ropeyard to Woolwich \" * for the carriage of timber. The Churchyard Wall. \u2014 When the Mast-house was built and the Mast-pond constructed in 1784, and the foreshore enclosed at Dock Rails, the wall of the Dockyard was extended eastward to the corner of High Street, and then it probably was that some important and per- * Chris. Pett's \"Woolwich\" was the Dockyard. The Ropeyard occupied the site of Beresford Street, afar from his dominion."], [283, "WOOLWICH. 161 manent works were performed, not only in raising and improving the road at Dock Rails, but also in securing the safety of the churchyard precipice. Some sort of retaining wall had been erected previously, and a State Paper of January 6th, L745, speaks of the churchwardens being then about to build such a wall on the north side of the churchyard. The wall, however, was not very high, and the protection subsequently added seems to have been an inner wall on the terrace. In the accompanying drawing, which I have happily lighted upon, the two walls are shown. The date of the picture is somewhere about 1780, for the original bears the impress of Sandby's hand, but there are living inhabitants who remember the two walls in existence. A Lych-gate. \u2014 Looking at this picture, however, I may confidently say that no one living ever saw, or, so far as I am aware, ever heard of, the gateway through which the people of a century since passed from High Street into the churchyard. It is not too much to imagine that this erection was an ancient lych-gate, at which the bearers of the dead rested their burdens on the way to the grave. The High Wall.\u2014 It was not until 1836 that the high wall which now keeps the churchyard from falling into Dock Rails was erected. We read that \u2014 On the 24th of August, 1836, the inhabitants of Woolwich met in vestry to receive tenders for carrying up the lofty boundary wall on the north side of the churchyard, and to make a rate for the expenses thereof as well as for the necessary repairs of the church. Mr. Noble's tender was accepted, and the churchwardens asked for a sixpenny rate. The collector said a threepenny rate would realise between \u00a3320 and \u00a3330, and Mr. Noble said it would cost \u00a31,500 for the erection of brick arches from the Horse and Star to the Hampshire Hog.* A letter was read from the arch deacon, recommending the parish to \" reclaim the old ground between the two waUs.\" It was then proposed that a rate of fourpence only be granted and applied in paying for the boundary wall, and this was carried by 37 votes to 17. Thereupon a poll was taken in favour of the sixpenny rate, which was endorsed by 248 ratepayers against 38. The high wall was then built as we see it when we pass along the tramway. The eastern end, I may remark, appears to be of older date than the remainder, and to have consisted originally of arches. A Ghastly Revel. \u2014 The old churchyard seems to have at all times suffered from neglect, and its present state is perhaps not worse than its condition a hundred years ago. None of the tombs to-day would permit of a scene like the following, which was reported in the year 1780 :\u2014 Mr. Constable, who w*as steward for John Bowater, Esq., lord of the manor of Woolwich, passing through the churchyard at twelve o'clock at night, was surprised * Presumably the present Mitre, in High Street, and Golden Cross, in Church Street."], [284, "162 RECORDS OF THE AVOOLWICH DISTRICT. to hear a loud noise like that of several persons singing. At first he thought it proceeded from the church, but on going to the church doors he found them fast and all silent within. The noise still continuing, he looked round the churchyard and observed a light in one of the large family tombs, and, going up to it, he found some drunken sailors had got into the vault, and were regaling themselves with bread, cheese, tobacco, and strong beer. They told him they belonged to the Robust man-of-war, and that, having resolved to spend a jolly night on shore, they had kept it up at the Ship and Punch Bowl till they were turned out by the landlord, and were obliged to take shelter there to finish the evening*. Clearing the Ground. \u2014 The condition of the churchyard did not improve with years, and on the 14th of February, 1838, we find an advertisement issued by the churchwardens to tbe following effect : \u2014 Whereas many of the tombs and stones in Woolwich churchyard have become dilapi dated, notice is hereby given to the parties claiming a right to the same, that if they do not come forward before the 15th day of March next and have them repaired, they will be removed and the ground appropriated, viz. : \u2014 Tomb of Elizabeth Andrews, 1737, and Edward Purnell, 1799 ; of William Baylis, 1785 ; Thomas Hooke, 1714 ; the Hon.

PARSONS AND PARISHIONERS. The Old Rectory. \u2014 Akin to the subjects of the church and churchyard is the parsonage house. This formerly stood in \" the Grove \" by the river-side, with its back upon High Street, Its position is shown in the plan prepared by John Barker in 1748 (page 41), and part of the site is now occupied by tbe shops west of Enon Chapel. The parsonage is known to have stood on the same spot for some hundreds of years. It is mentioned in tbe Close Rolls of Queen Eliza beth in connection with the following transaction : \u2014 Oct. 25th, 156S.-\u2014 John Martin of Woolwich, yeoman, sold, for \u00a3200, to William Maresam, Robert Broke, and Richard HaU, citizens and grocers of London, a great messuage, with barns, stables, orchards, and wharf, and four tenements and gardens, and a wharf adjoining the great tenement, in Woolwich, between the Queen's highway (east) the parsonage of Woolwich (west) the Thames (north) and the high way leading from Woolwich Church, and the tenement of Richard Heywood, Esq. (south).* The parsonage remained the parsonage until early in this century. In 1809 it was represented to Parliament that the old parsonage house was \" small, decayed, and badly situated by the banks of the Thames,\" and in the same year the Rev. Hugh Fraser, rector, sup ported by the Bishop of Rochester, obtained an Act empowering them to sell the old parsonage, and let seventeen of the total twenty acres of the glebe on building leases for ninety-nine years, in order to raise a sum of \u00a33,000 for the purpose of building a new rectory-house, which was finished in 1811. The old house and garden were sold for \u00a31,000; the house was pulled down in 1811, t and on its site and in the garden, we are told, \" several neat houses \" were erected. The Xew Rectory. \u2014 The present rectory which we see in Rectory Place was built on the glebe in the midst of three acres of garden, orchard, and pasture, which have since been considerably curtailed. The remainder of the glebe was advertised to be let under the Act for * This exact description evidently applies to the great house previously spoken of at page 45 and fixes its precise locality, w*hich appears to have been the site of the Consumers' Gas Works. t Lysons' Supplement."], [286, "164 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. raising the \u00a33,000, but the sale ofthe leases did not realise the sum re quired, and a loan of \u00a32,000 had to be obtained on security of the living at tbe heavy interest of eight and a half per cent. This was a pressing burden upon Mr. Fraser and his successor until, with the help of subsequent sales, it was paid off. The Rector's Glebe. \u2014 The glebe lands extended from the church yard to Rectory Grove, and embraced the whole area from Mulgrave Place to the back of Church Street. In February and March, 1849, there was a sale of 280 houses on the glebe land, and they were described as situated in Rectory Place, St. Mary Street, * King Street, parts of Sun Alley and Parson's Hill, form ing \" from the memory of man \" part of tbe glebe of the rectory. The property, which was of the estimated value of \u00a34,000, was sold under the power of an Act passed in the previous session of Parliament, entitled \" an Act for the sale ofthe glebe lands belonging to the rectory of Woolwich, in the county of Kent, and to confirm the building leases of such lands, and for the endowment of a new district t and for other purposes.\" An \" apportionment of rent charge in lieu of tithes for the parish of Woolwich,\" confirmed by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners on Sep tember 30th, 1846, is as follows : \u2014 \u25a0 Total area 1,200 acres, of which 399 are marsh land, 144 upland pasture, 120 gardens, and the remainder occupied by houses, roads, wastes, and sites for building.

The Sunday school-room appears to have been removed when the National Schools were built, which was in 1840. The infant schools date from 1877. The Vestry Eooks. \u2014 Much that is interesting may be learnt from the old vestry minutes and churchwardens' accounts, from which the following extracts are presented : \u2014 1C98, May 16th.

Curious Wills. \u2014 -The following remarkable allusions to Woolwich Church are found in some very ancient wills. It will be observed that they all bear date prior to the Dissolution and Reformation : \u2014 1455, Oct. lst.

Early Telegraphy. \u2014 Several drawings of Woolwich Church (dating from 1790 to 1800) show the semaphore telegraph on the tower hy which messages were sent to ships up and down the river in the latter Woolwich Church and Semaphore, 1790. part of the last and the early part of the present century, and I have inserted one to illustrate this phase of its history. As lately as 1847 the tower was made use of for similar purposes, for in that year Mr. Ruegg wrote \u2014 Woolwich Church may be seen for some miles up and down the river, and when any visitor of importance is expected from the continent, a watch is kept from its tower, and the hoisting of the standard on its flagstaff intimates to the authorities the moment the steamer arrives in sight.

Church Rates. \u2014 During the last century, before people bad dis covered how to do without church rates, the sum of about \u00a3200 per annum was raised for the church by a charge of something like two shillings in the pound, the assessment being low and the excusals manv. In these church rates it was usual to include Burrage House, Plum stead, and all the property down to Cole Fields, at the bottom of Dead man's Lane (Vicarage Road). From this fact I have supposed that a large portion of Plumstead was at that time in Woolwich, and that the division line was that adopted at the formation of the borough of Greenwich in 1832 \u2014 a line drawn from the Storekeeper's House (Middle Arsenal Gates) to the stile at tbe top of Sandy Hill. There are, however, paramount reasons for concluding that the boundary between the two parishes was at all times the Brook Hill stream, and it may therefore be inferred \u2014 firstly, that tbe residents at Burrage House, &c, paid rates to Woolwich Church in return for the privileges of worshipping there ; and, secondly, that the borough boundary may have been extended into Plumstead in order to embrace the few bouses which had grown up on the borders of Woolwich. Church rates at Woolwich were continued until 1859, when a pro posed rate was defeated at a poll by a majority of 702 to 591, and no attempt to enforce upon the parish the care and maintenance of the church has since been made. Woolwich Cemetery. \u2014 In connection with the closing of the churchyard, it has been necessary to mention Woolwich Cemetery. The beautiful burial-ground which fronts the King's Highway on the eastern slope of Plumstead Common was opened as a cemetery for the parish of Woolwich on January 3rd, 1856, in pursuance of a poll taken a year earlier. It was consecrated on the ecclesiastical side by the Bishop of Oxford, the whole having been purchased and laid out at a cost of \u00a36,200, raised by a loan repayable in twenty years. Adding to the Cemetery. \u2014 The ground, consisting of nearly twelve acres, was practically absorbed in thirty years. In that period 25,517 burials took place in the cemetery, and it became necessary to obtain more space. Accordingly, taking time by the forelock, a vestry meeting was called on 21st December, 1883, and sanction obtained without a poll to purchase twenty acres of land adjacent. The cost of this, with the laying out, and building a wall round both the enclosures, was estimated at \u00a314,000. This also has been raised by loan, and the new ground was opened on the 23rd of December, 1885, on which date the church portion was consecrated by the Bishop of Rochester.

The first stone was laid with much ceremony on the 6th of June, 1833, being the same month in which the company was formed. In 1834 the building was opened, and for sixteen years, i.e. until 1850, it was conducted as a proprietary chapel under the ministry of the Rev. Capel Molyneux, B.A., who became afterwards distinguished as a preacher at the West End of London. The Rev. Duncan Long, M.A., held the position for about one year, and in 1852 the church was consecrated by Bishop Blomfield (Wool wich being at that time in the diocese of London), having been purchased from the proprietors by a subscription raised by the rector, the Rev. H. Brown, the War Department giving \u00a31,000. The church then ceased to be proprietary, and became a chapel of ease to the parish church. The Rev. Thomas Reynolds, M.A., was appointed minister of the church in 1852, and retained that post until 1860. In 1860 the Rev. James Stewart Ruddock, M.A., succeeded to the ministry, and remained until 1869. In 1867 the Rev. James White, M.A., came as assistant curate to Mr. Ruddock, and in 1869 succeeded him as minister of the church, continuing until 1877.* From 1877 to 1879 the rector of Woolwich, the Hon. and Rev. A. Anson, with the help of curates, conducted the services, being also assisted for a part of the time by the Rev. T. Hutton. On February 7th, 1879, the Rev. J. Jordan entered upon the duties of minister of the church, and on the 13th of March, 1881, Holy Trinity was exalted to tbe position of a separate parish, Mr. Jordan being appointed the first vicar. The work prospered in his hands, and a vicarage was provided in Rectory Place, but a severe illness compelled him to retire on October lst, 1888 ; and he died at Shanklin, November 10th, 1888. St. Thomas's. \u2014 The district of St. Thomas was formed of sections taken from the mother parishes of Woolwich and Charlton in 1844. The church was commenced in 1847, and finished, consecrated, and opened in 1850. It cost between \u00a35,000 and \u00a36,000.

In 1869, a site having been secured by the Bishop of London's Fund, a temporary building was opened. In 1871 the permanent schools were ready, and in 1874 the church, or portion of a church,* was begun. The foundation stone of the chancel was laid on July 15th, 1875.

But from that year until 1873 the Government took little interest in it, and the services were carried on by curates under the vicars of Plumstead, to whom the building was lent as a chapel of ease to the parish church. The greater part of the building is, however, in Woolwich, as may be seen by the boundary mark in Plumstead Road. At length tbe War Office resumed charge of the building, and the Rev. Charles Berry was appointed to conduct it, with the rank of Chaplain of the Arsenal, in 1873. An Older Arsenal Chapel. \u2014 There was at one time a place of worship inside the Arsenal.

The War Department contributed \u00a318,000 towards tbe cost, but the burden of the internal decorations was borne by the Royal Regiment of Artillery. The edifice was consecrated in November, 1863. It is very rich in memorials, mostly of modern date. The windows are nearly all of stainod glass given to commemorate the names of brave soldiers. At the western end above the gallery is a handsome rose window in memory of Lord Herbert, erected by his widow.

CHAPTER XVII. NONCONFORMITY. Early Dissenters. \u2014 There are few traces of early dissent from the established form of worship to be found in the records of Woolwich. In the year 1662 the rector of tbe parish, the Rev. William Hawkes, was ejected from the Church for an offence against the Act of Uniformity, but it is not known whether he had any following, or whether he con tinued any kind of ministration apart from the orthodoxy.

Samuel Oldfred, whose ordination took place on April Now \" Ship Stairs,\" or \"Ship and Half-moon Stairs,\" Rodney Street."], [303, "WOOLWICH. 179 14th, 1698. After him came the Rev. George Jacomb, and then the Rev. Emmanuel Ellerke, who died after one year in 1727 ; the Rev. Joseph Stokes, 1728 ; and the Rev. Benjamin Stokes in 1735. The last named was shut out of the meeting bouse, but was restored by the Committee of Deputies ; at bis death in 1772 the congregation was dispersed, and some money which was left to it was claimed by another community. Until 1756, the meeting bouse had been the only place of worship in Woolwich excepting tbe parish church. Mr. RanweU, in a pamphlet * published in 1837, stated that \" the small dissenting place \" was still standing in Meeting House Lane, and that it had at one time been occupied by the Scotch Presbyterians, who were \" few in number, onlv meeting for worship twice on the Lord's Day.\" The Oldest existing Chapel. \u2014 Enon Chapel was the first Baptist sanctuary established in Woolwich. In 1754 a small community of twelve persons was drawn together by mutual inclination, and one of them in 1756 built a small meeting house in Hog Lane (Nile Street). It was opened on the 10th of October in that year, when Mr. R. McGregor preached and became the pastor. So rapidly did the con gregation increase, that tbe building was soon found insufficient, and in 1761 a chapel was built on tbe site now occupied by \" Enon \" in High Street. This too was overcrowded before many years were past, and the present building was erected on the same ground and opened in July, 1775. Enon Chapel is therefore the oldest nonconformist place of worship in the parish. Early Persecution. \u2014 The dissenting movement was naturally disliked by those who remained faithful to the Establishment, but its aggressors were really the vulgar and ungodly people of the town, who persecuted tbe early Baptists without stint or mercy. The pastor was openly insulted in the public street, and his effigy was drawn through the town upon an ass, labelled \u2014 \"McGregor, the Baptist Parson.': One of the enemy, however, was smitten by tbe truth. He went to scoff and stayed to pray, became an earnest Christian, and was after wards a successful minister of tbe gospel at Reading. Mr. McGregor remained for the long period of forty-seven years in charge of the chapel, and when be became incapacitated by reason of his age, Mr. W. Culver was chosen (in 1799) his co-pastor. Mr. McGregor bad founded and nourished the Sabbath school, and sent out * \"The Memory of the Blessed, or Biographical Sketches of some Persons connected with the First Baptist Church, Woolwich\", with an Account of the Introduction of the Gospel into the Town,\" by William Ranwell, senior deacon."], [304, "180 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. workers from Enon to preach and set up schools in the villages of Kent. He saw a great improvement in the moral and religious aspect of Woolwich before his death, which took place at tbe age of eighty-eight years, in April, 1804. He was interred under the chapel. Mr. Culver was pastor till his death in 1827, a period of thirty years. During his time the little church suffered the loss of many workers by a great reduction in the Government establishments after the battle of Waterloo. Mr. Bowes succeeded on the decease of Mr. Culver, but after nine years resigned the pastorate to take a charge in London. Mr. Galpine then held the office for a short time. Mr. C. Box was chosen pastor in 1839, and for thirty-two years was active in the cause. He resigned in 1871, through age, but continued to attend until his death in 1881. Mr. Lynn and Mr. Brittain held the pastorate for the ten years following Mr. Box, and in 1881 the present minister, Mr. W. K. Squirrel, commenced his labours. Many ofthe deacons of Enon have held long service. Mr. C. Wren was in office for twenty-four years, and died in 1807, leaving the interest of \u00a32,000 to educate poor children, which has been a great blessing. Mr. W. Ranwell was deacon for fifty-four years. Mr. R. Abrahams, the present senior deacon, has been connected with the church for forty-six years, during thirty-one of which he has held office. Mr. Wren was one of tbe first promoters of Sabbath schools, but long before such schools were thought of it was customary to assemble children in the chapel on Sundays for religious instruction. In later 3'ears a large room was hired, and several places of worship united in teaching the children there before they went to their respective chapels. Queen Street Chapel. \u2014 Queen Street Chapel was a Baptist off shoot from Enon Chapel in Hign JStreet. In 1786 Mr. Adam Freeman and twenty-four others withdrew lrom Enon on the question of free or open communion. They met for some time in a large room in the Market Place,* and then erected the present- chapel in Queen Street. The Rev. Adam Freeman was ordained first pastor on March 10th, 1789. The Rev. John Cox joined as co-pastor with Mr. Freeman, and afterwards had sole charge. He was formally recognised as pastor on April I6th, 1833, and remained until his resignation on September 16th, 1854. The Rev. Charles Hawson succeeded Mr. Cox on his retirement, February 26th, 1856. The Rev. John Teall followed, entering on his charge August llth, 1861, and resigning March 28th, 1877. The Rev.

Mr. Shrubsole came from Sheerness to be master-mast maker at Woolwich, and the Countess of Huntingdon invited him \" to preach at her chapel in the Plumstead Road and to superintend its spiritual concerns,\" which be did in 1773 for a period of seven months.

On the first Sunday of that month be preached from Psalm xliii. 4, \"I will go unto the altar of God,\" when he was seized with sudden illness and died in a few days. A tablet erected in the chapel stated that he was for twenty-four years minister of tbe congregation, that he died on August 16th, 1820, in the seventieth year of his age, and that, in token of pious respect, his mortal remains were \" deposited beneath the table pew.\" Salem chose as its pastor after Mr. Percy the Rev. Thomas James, who took charge on October 24th, 1821. He increased the congrega tion so much that more accommodation was needed, and the chapel was enlarged at a cost of \u00a31,200, and reopened September 23rd, 1829. The collections on the opening day exceeded \u00a350, and it was remarked that there were at that time no fewer than eighteen places of worship in Woolwich. Mr. James remained from 1821 to 1843, when he resigned. The Rev. J. S. Bright, of Luton, Bedfordshire, succeeded him, but remained only until 1847, when he removed to the Independent church at Dorking, Surrey. The Rev. Dr. Carlisle next accepted the charge, but in 1852 the old community began to show signs of decay, being sapped by the new growth which has become the vigorous Congregational church of Rectory Place. From the minute book of the Congregational church at Salem Chape * Page 175."], [308, "182 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. which covers tbe period between 1839 and 1843, we have not only some details of an unhappy controversy between two of its members which throw a light upon tbe subsequent division, but also some further information on the subject of the church's first establishment at Woolwich. From February 20th, 1798, until bis decease in August, 1820, Mr. Percy admitted into fellowship 238 members, of whom 154 died or had withdrawn or been expelled, leaving at his death 81. From 1821, when tbe Rev. Thomas James took oversight of the church, until 1839, be was reported to have admitted 180 members, leaving at that date 115 in actual fellowship. The church thereafter appears to have declined in numbers and in spirit, and in 1852 tbe young off shoot just mentioned withered the parent trunk, Services were still carried on at Salem under various ministers for several years, but at length the building fell into the hands of the London School Board, and now forms part of Powis Street Schools. It was on April Sth, 1852, that eight Sunday school teachers con nected with this place resolved Rectory Place Congregational Church, Woolwich. upon founding \" another Christian interest on Congregational prin ciples.\" A document read at the laying of the foundation of Rectory Place Church on November 3rd, 18*58, stated that \u2014 This cause was originated by Thomas R. Richardson, James Dadswell, James S. Mi-kin, William Irwin, Joseph Slack, Christmas King, Thomas Mann, and William Fairbrother, eight Sunday School teachers, on the 5th of April, 1852. A Sunday school was opened on April 25th, and on July 20th the auction rooms of Messrs. Church and Son in William Street* were hired for divine worship, fitted up, and called \"Ebenezer Chapel.\" Messrs. Tame, Richardson, Smart, Boylin, Saw, and Dadswell where chosen deacons. On August 23rd, 1852, a church was formed of forty-two members. On September 7th, 1852, divine worship commenced in the Masonic Hall, William Street. On April 24th, 1853, the Rev. Samuel Hebditch, of Ashburton, Devon, was appointed first pastor ; and on October 5th following he was publicly recognised. The Masonic Hall."], [309, "WOOLWICH. 183 On October 22nd, 1855, Mr. Hebditch resigned and removed to Bristol. On October 5th, 1856, the Rev. W. Gill, formerly missionary at Rarotonga, took up the work at Woolwich with great energy and success. Rectory Place. \u2014 During Mr. Gill's highly successful pastorate the new church in Rectory Place was resolved upon, planned, built, and paid for. On November 3rd, 1858, the memorial stone of the church was laid, and on June 28th, 1859, the opening services were held. The cost, \u00a37,000, was entirely defrayed in seven years. On June 22nd, 1868, the Rev. W. Gill resigned. He died at Blaekheath on August 14th, 1878. On July 18th, 1869, the Rev. R. W. Carpenter, of Devonport, was appointed, but retired through ill health on December 19th, 1870, and died May 16th, 1871. On March 3rd, 1871, the Rev. Thomas Sissons, of Bishopsgate Street Chapel, London, became pastor, and remained until March 18th, 1884, when he accepted a similar charge at Beckenham. On July 31st, 1884, he was succeeded by the Rev. A. J. Viner, of London. The Sunday school numbers about four hundred, and there are two hundred and seventy scholars at the Mission Station in Pellipar road. The Presbyterians. \u2014 The Presbyterian Church was established in Woolwich as early as 1662, prior to the Great Fire and Plague of London and the Dutch War, prior to the passing of the Conventicle Act, and therefore early enough to endure persecutions under that Act and the other repressive measures which sullied the periods of Charles II. and his successors. We have no evidence of any build ing devoted to the Presbyterian form of worship in the early days, and probably, after the manner of the Covenanters, its disciples met in the open air ; but about 1756, as will be seen from the records of Enon Chapel, the Scotch Presbyterians appear to have made use for a time of the old meeting house in Meeting House Lane, High Street. Scotch Church, New Road. \u2014 At a later date, which I cannot trace, the Scots built a church at the corner of Green's End and Powis Street \u2014 an unpretending structure in a roomy graveyard and screened by trees, just discernible in the view of Beresford Square on Plate XII. Here they met until 1842, when they migrated to New Road. The following account appears under date of October Sth, 1841 : \u2014 The present church in which the Presbyterian form of worship is performed by a clergyman of the Established Church of Scotland being far too small for the congregation, the minister and influential members commenced a subscription to build a new church and schools, and have succeeded in raising \u00a32,856, besides having obtained an eligible piece of ground of ample dimensions from the Board of Ordnance. Wednesday the foundation-stone was laid by Lieut.-Colonel Dundas, C.B., Royal Artillery, and presented an imposing spectacle. The proceedings * He was afterwards useful in other labours, and iu 1SS5 went to Xorth Adelaide Australia, where he was elected chairman of the Congregational Union, and died in 1888."], [310, "184 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. commenced at one o'clock in the present church, and the procession formed in the following order : \u2014 The Beadle of the Church. School Children. Non-commissioned Officers and Men of the Royal Artiller}*, about five hundred, that being the average of Presbyterians in the corps at Woolwich. Then the Royal Sappers and Miners, &c. The Builder and Architect. The Ministers and Office Bearers. Then a division of the Royal Artillery closed the Procession. At the conclusion of the proceedings the Royal Artillery band played \" God save the Queen.\" The records of the ministry in a connected line carry us back in four long strides to 1797, and they are as follows : \u2014 Rev. John Blythe . . . Feb., 1797, to Oct., 1S29. Rev. Dr. Scott . . . . 1830 \u201e 1837. Rev. W. M. Thompson . . Aug., 1838 \u201e Dec., 1876. Rev. Dr. Raitt .... Dec., 1876 (still serving) Dr. Scott was afterwards Professor of English Literature in the Universitv of London, and Principal of Owens College, Manchester. He was obliged to leave the Presbytery in consequence of having adopted dissentient views. During the very long service of the Rev. W. M. Thompson he had as bis colleagues the Rev. W. Cousin, now of Lady Glenorchy's Free Church, Edinburgh, and the Rev. J. Nisbet Wallace, now of the Presbyterian Church, Swindon. The prejudice against the employment of instrumental music in divine worship, which was for long a denial to tbe Scotch Church, has lately been overcome at this and most other Presbyterian places of worship. A good organ and choir have been provided. St. Andrew's. \u2014 The large and influential congregation of Presby- terians now worshipping in St. Andrew's Church, Anglesea Hill, had a small beginning. Twenty-six years ago (1862) a few Presbyterians met in a room in the Royal Arsenal and resolved to petition the London Presbytery to open a preaching station in connection with the United Presbyterian Church. The old Congregational church in Powis Street (Salem Chapel), now used as a Board school, was taken at a rent of \u00a370, and a committee of management, who charged themselves with the expense, was organised. In November, 1862, the Rev. R. Balgarnie (now Dr. Balgarnie) was ordained as the first pastor, and under his ministry the congregation increased steadily. In 1868 it removed from Salem Chapel to an iron church on the site of the present building. In 1871 the foundation stone of the present church was laid by James E. Matheson, Esq., and in May, 1872, the church was opened by the Rev. Donald"], [311, "WOOLWICH. 185 Fraser, D.D. The original outlay was over \u00a35,000, but since that time a gallery, heat ing furnaces, organ loft, and choir gallery have been added, so that the whole outlay has been about \u00a38,000.* In 1879, Dr. Balgarnie having accepted a call to Gravesend, the Rev. A. Craig was inducted to the pastorate. Owing, however, to weak health he was compeUed to resign on July 12th, 1881, and seek a field of labour in New South Wales. The present pastor is Dr. Rentoul, who w*as inducted on the 23rd of February, 1882. The congregation is in a very flourishing condition. Of tbe original committee of management one alone remains still in office, Mr. James Ronald, who is at present both an elder and a manager in the church. After the terrible accident at Shoeburyness on the 26th of February, 1885, in which, out of nine persons around the shell which burst, seven were killed, tbe congregation of St. Andrew's erected a stained glass window in their church as a token of their gratitude to God for tbe escape of Mr. Robert Low, manager of the Royal Laboratory in the Arsenal. The window bears the following inscription : \u2014 Erected by this congregation as a token of our gratitude to God for the preserva tion of our esteemed friend and fellow-worshipper, Mr. Robert Low, in the explosion at Shoeburyness, on February 26th, 1885. Mr. Low on his restoration to health presented the congregation with two stained-glass windows, the centre window on each side of the church being bis gift. Carmel Chapel. \u2014 Carmel Chapel in Anglesea Road was erected in 1856. The congregation had previously gathered and prospered at a small edifice bearing the same name in New Road, the site of which is now partly covered by tbe Gun Tavern. We read something of its origin in an old magazine published under the title of The Earthen- Vessel as follows : \u2014 Formation of another Baptist Church at Woolwich. \u2014 On Lord's Day, January 13th, 1850, a church was formed on strict Baptist principles at Carmel Chapel, New Road, Woolwich. In the morning Mr. Israel Atkinson, who has been for some time supplying here, preached to the people. Iu the afternoon Mr. John Foreman addressed the congregation on the nature and constitution of a Gospel church The order of a Gospel church he proved from the New* Testament to be strict communion, admitting none others to the table of the Lord than those who had previously made a public profession by baptism by immersion Mr. J. A. Jones then asked for some account of the leadings of Divine Providence, which had led them to take Carmel Chapel, and to form themselves into a church. This ques tion was answered by one of the members, who read a plain statement of facts. Mr. Jones then requested that those who were about to become members of the church would stand up and hold up their right hand as a token of the same, which they did. \" Now,\" said John Andrew Jones, \" having thus publicly given yourselves to God, give yourselves to one another, as did the disciples of old, by turning round and * In 1886 a bazaar held in the room under the church to clear off the debt realised within a little of \u00a31,000."], [312, "186 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. giving each other the right hand of fellowship.\" This they did, and the ordinance of the Lord's Supper was then administered. The newly-formed church consists of about twenty or twenty-five members. At tbe exodus, and for many years afterwards, Carmel was under the pastorate of the Rev. H. Hanks, who died on December 26, 1882, aged seventy-one years. The little chapel in New Road which was the birthplace of \" Car mel \" was previously called \" Providence Chapel,\" and was held under \" Lady Huntingdon's connection \" first by Mr. Bickerdike and after wards by the Rev. W. Woodlands, and had a scattered congregation, who at length united with the people of Enion Chapel in Sun Street, where Mr. Woodlands was pastor for many years. Parson's Hill Chapel. \u2014 It was about the year 1855 that a portion of the congregation at Queen Street Chapel had occasion to Parson's Hill Chapel, Woolwich. differ with the administration and formed a separate camp, setting up their standard at the Lecture Hall over the Baths in Nelson Street, under the leadership of the Rev. Harris Crassweller. Here they continued to worship according to the ordinances of the Baptist Church until the new chapel at Parson's Hill was opened in 1857. Mr. Crassweller left about 1864, and shortly afterwards the Rev. W."], [313, "187 WOOLWICH. Woods took charge, remaining until the year 1869, when his place was taken by the Rev. J. Manley Camp. After four years in the work Mr. Camp also left, and the Rev. J. Turner became the pastor and did zealous service until 1879, when he retired, and the congrega tion, like a flock without a shepherd, dispersed, the chapel being left to the care of the London Baptist Association. It did not long remain unoccupied, for the Rev. John Wilson, who had been preaching in the vicinity for a short time previously, made application to the Association and was installed at Parson's Hill, where, with remarkable energy and devotion, he has established the present large and united community. The debt of \u00a31,000 which Mr. Wilson encountered was boldly increased by \u00a3700 for tbe erection of galleries, but tbe whole encumbrance was speedily swept away, and the young society set out for new fields of labour. Tbe Mission Chapel at New Beckton was erected at a cost of nearly \u00a3600, the chapels at Joseph Street, Woolwich, and at Silver town are likewise branches of this trunk, and services are held in con nection with the same head at both the Royal Assembly Rooms and the Co-operative Hull. The roll of membership, which numbered but 90 when the present minister began, contains now over 700 names, and there are 500 children in tbe Sunday schools. The Wesleyan Methodists. \u2014 The brick building which is now the Steam Flour-mills in New Road was tbe first Wesleyan chapel at Woolwich, and was opened by Mr. George Phillips and his two brothers, eleven years before the close of last century. The building afterwards became the Roman Catholic church,* for it was vacated by the Wesleyans in 1816, when they erected their present chapel in William Street. Woolwich w*as in the East London Circuit until 1811, when it was constituted part of tbe Deptford Circuit, and so remained until 1849, the year in which the Woohvich Circuit was constituted.

The Birth of a Church. \u2014 One of the founders of Wesleyanism in Woolwich, indeed its avant-coureur, has left an autobiography in MS., which affords a complete record of the outspring of the present large and flourishing circuit. He was a working carpenter, born in 1750 at Upminster, Essex, and was a member of the Established Church until 1782. He resided for some years at Purfleet, where he joined a little society led by Mr. Weaver, a devout disciple of Mr. Wesley, and on the 26th of July, 1786, he came to Woolwich to work in \"The Warren.\" He says \u2014 I wished to continue at Purfleet, for I could not embrace the Calvinistic doctrine with which Woolwich was deluged. Here was none of Mr. Wesley's people, no class-meeting. I constantly attended the preaching at Mr. Percy's,* and also the Baptist chapels, and sometimes at the church. I also attended all their prayer meetings, but they would not suffer me to pray with them, except I would abandon Mr. Wesley's opinions and principles. Sometimes I have been detained at night by Congregational, now Oidnance or Arsenal Chapel, Plumstead Road."], [315, "WOOLWICH. 189 the Baptists in Mr. McGrigor's chapel.* In October, 1786, Mr. Witten, an engraver in the Tower of London, came down to the Royal Artillery Barracks in order to engrave some arms. In the evening we met in Green's End, and he told me he intended to preach that evening in a room at Ropeyard Rails. I promised to be there if I could find the place. I did, and the room was almost filled with attentive hearers. After the service we went with Mr. Richard Mills, an invalids of the Royal Artillery, to his little cottage Mr. Mills asked me to call upon him some evening, and, as there was no preaching nor prayer-meetings on Monday night at any of the chapels in Woolwich, I was led to choose Monday night, and cailed upon him The blessing of the Lord was upon us. This w*as in a small house in Warren Lane. I continued to go every Monday night, and the good old man began to invite his neighbours to come to his house, saying he would have a young man there who would pray with them and for them. In the deed many attended, and sometimes more than the room would contain. The latter end of November, a young man, Joseph Johnson. came from London and got employment in the Dockyard. He by some means while in London heard there was a Methodist in Woolwich, and that lie belonged to the Warren. He came into the Warren and inquired for me, and as he did not know my name he inquired for a Methodist until he found me. We agreed to meet at Mr. Percy's chapel, Plumstead Road. About the middle of December he proposed to me to form a class. It was proposed to the people at the prayer-meeting, and it was agreed to meet on Thursday evenings. Our first meeting in class was on the first Thursday in the new year, 1787. Brother Johnson did not come ; we were but four in number. The next Thursday we added two more, and the class increased. Although many of them were Calvinists, they were desirous of Mr. Wesley's preachers amongst us, but none would come. I next went to Mr. John Wesley and applied to him for some of the local preachers. Mr. Wesley did not deny my request, nor give me any promise, but he told me to go back to Woolwich, and said, \" You will be the seed of a society there.\" I answered him, \" No, sir ; the seed is not good.\" Soon after I went to Purfleet to my friend Mr. Weaver, and he proposed that he would come to Woolwich and preach once every month, free from expense, upon condition that I could get three more local preachers, so as to have preaching every Sunday. I went to Dept ford, and Mr. Jacobs agreed to come once a month ; also Mr. Phillips, who, in about two years and a half after, built the chapel in the New Road. I went to Mr. Witten, at the Tower of London, and he also agreed to be one of the four. Now I had to look for a place to preach in, and, after seeking awhile, I hired a one-pair-of-stairs room at eighteenpence a week The local preachers in London generally breakfasted together every Sunday morning, and Mr. Phillips attended there also. He laid the state of the people of Woolwich before them, and they were of opinion a trial should he made. Soon after this Woolwich was put into the London circuit plan. I think this was in the month of June, 1788. In the September following Mr. Phillips said to me that he thought, if a chapel could be built, some good might be done. He proposed this to Mr. J. Wesley, and he did not object Soon after this Mr. Phillips went to a builder and agreed with him to build a chapel, and then he came to me to get a piece of ground to build it on. We sought to get a piece in the middle of the Rope Ground, but found that no lease could be given, the estate being in Chan cery. We next applied to Mr. Everit, and took a piece in the brickfield joining to the New Road. Mr. Phillips with a bricklayer, on the 18th of October, 1788, and we, staked out the ground for the foundation of the chapel that day, and then com- menced building it, and it was opened on the 29th of October, 1789, by Mr. John Phillips. The service began at half-past ten in the morning, half-past two in the afternoon, and six o'clock in the evening. * Enon Chapel, High Street. t Pensioner. N"], [316, "190 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. The manuscript is unsigned, but it bears on the face of it the unmis takable hand of one who was closely identified with the work which he so lovingly describes. This was Mr. Thomas Murrell, whose tombstone, recently restored, is to be seen in tbe little graveyard on the northern side of the chapel in William Street. It informs us that \" he was the founder of the Methodist Society in Woolwich,\" and that he died on January 30, 1837. Religion in the Army. \u2014 From a little book entitled, \" Experi mental and Practical Piety, or Memorials of Sergeant Rudd, Royal Artillery,\" by the Rev. R. Sargent, Woolwich, 1861,\" I extract a few further details, from which we may gather some idea of religion in the army during the earlier half of the present century, as well as infor mation specially affecting the Wesleyan community. Sergeant Rudd was born at Arklow, in Ireland, on April 6, 1777, and was devoutly brought up in the principles of the Church of England. He enlisted in the Royal Artillery in 1801, and came to Woolwich, where he fell into evil ways, until one Sunday evening, being in a public-house near the old church at Plumstead, he heard the sound of singing, which reminded him of home and his old convictions. He at once left the company, vowing to be faithful for the rest of his life. In a per sonal narrative he says : \u2014 '* One evening, crossing over the barrack field, very solitary and unhappy, I was spoken to by a friend, to whom I opened my mind. He invited me to accompany him into Hanging Wood for prayer. In this wood was an old hollow tree, to which two or three godly soldiers used to retire for prayer and religious conversation. There they could possess and enjoy a place of retirement for social worship such as the barrack-room did not afford, and there they repaired every night. On one of these occasions the power of faith came down upon me.\" Sergeant Rudd joined the Wesleyan Church in 1S04, when the society was small, and worshipped in the wooden chapel in Meeting-house Lane. The \" Old Chapel\" in the New* Road, in which the society had worshipped, was mortgaged to \"a Mr. Weaver,\" who with others joined the Kilhamite division, and took with them the right of occupying the chapel with their own ministers. The Wesleyans worship ping in Meeting-house Lane were, however, though few, united and devoted. \" The artillery soldiers now began to attend our little chapel,\" says Sergeant Rudd, and he was appointed leader in 1806, with special reference to the converted soldiers, in which employment he continued for forty-seven years. About 1810, the congregation at Mr. Weaver's chapel having fallen away, he sold it to the \"Old Body,\" who now left Meeting-house Lane and took possession again of the chapel in New Road, and many young recruits became by the help of Sergeant Rudd steady and useful Christian soldiers in the Peninsular war. He states: \u2014 \" We commenced additional prayer meetings at six o'clock every morning, which became well attended by the soldiers, and every meeting became more interesting. In 1813 our chapel was so crowded that it was impossible to seat even the mem bers of the society, now increased to nearly four hundred. At this time I was the society steward, and as we belonged to the City Road circuit I had much pleasure in reporting to the friends the great work that was going on &t Woolwich. The preachers, Messrs. Clark, Griffith, Benson, Rankin,and Rodda, visited Woolwich every fortnight, and the work continued so to spread both amongst soldiers and civilians that the"], [317, "WOOLWICH. 191 friends judged the time had arrived when they ought to have a much larger chapel. Hence the present beautiful and commodious house of God, which was erected in the year 1816.\" Sergeant Rudd was not permitted to go on without considerable opposition and serious danger to his temporal interests. Those in command at the barracks sought to thwart him in every possible way. More than once he was threatened to be sent abroad. Bibles and religious books were, if not literally prohibited, rarely to be met with amongst soldiers, and he hung behind the guard-room door a card, upon which was written that any of the men wishing for tbe loan of a Bible or interesting book on religious subjects could have it by applying to himself. The captain of the day observed the card, and in great anger took it to the commandant of the garrison. Sergeant Rudd was sent for, severely reprimanded, and significantly informed that a station abroad would be a very suitable place for him. But Captain Maitland, an officer of a different spirit, hearing of the facts, directed that a copy of the Scriptures should be placed in every guard-room, which was also reported to the commandant, who passed a censure upon the captain. Captain Maitland then communicated with his father, who held a high commission. His father communicated with still higher authority, and the result was that a wag-g-on-load of Bibles was sent down to Woolwich barracks for the guard-rooms and sick- wards of the hospitals. This. with concurrent circumstances, led to the regulation still in existence* that every soldier's kit shall be supplied with a copy of the Bible. Fron; an acorn springs a forest. In a letter dated June, 182S, Sergeant Rudd says that prayer meet ings would frequently continue five or six hours, until one, two, or three o'clock in the morning. At these meetings perhaps twenty persons would pray, and many twice over, and the exertion, combined with his labours as a clerk in the Adjutant-General's office, seriously impaired his health. He continued, however, active in tbe work for many years after, and died January 17, 1861, in the 85th year of his age. Welsh Chapel. \u2014 The Welsh Methodists have had a small chapel on Parson's Hill for about eighty years. It did not exist in 1806, in which year \" The Beauties of England and Wales \" records : \u2014 \" There are in Woolwich six meeting houses, one for Presbyterians, two for Anabap tists, two for the disciples of Mr. Whitfield,* and one for those of Mr. Wesley.\" Neither the Welsh Chapel, Carmel Chapel (New Road), Zion Chapel (Upper Market Street), Union Chapel (Sun Street), Bethlehem Chapel (Charles Street), nor any other chapel in Woolwich, had then como into existence. * Counting that in Plumstead Road, which seems to have been closed. N2"], [318, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 192 But in 1812 the obituary notice appears of the Rev. David Morgan, minister of the Welsh Chapel at Deptford and Woolwich, and formerly of Swansea, who died October 31. The Welsh chapel bas had but a feeble life, owing to tbe sparseness of the Welsh people at Woolwich, and in 1852 the following notice was posted on its doors : \u2014 \" This Chappell Too Lett. Enquire of Sun Alley, Daniel Lewis, near her Pump.\" Bethlehem Chapel. \u2014 There are few records of a remarkable nature connected with the smaller places of worship. Some have ceased to exist, like Bethlehem Chapel, which, after being some time closed, has during the last few years been converted to the uses of tbe \" Woolwich Chess Club.\" In repairing the floor, as already mentioned, some skeleton forms were discovered, but not removed, the remains of those who were buried under the church fifty years before ; and a stone tablet which stood behind the pulpit recorded the long and faithful services of Mr. Burnett, tbe zealous pastor of Bethlehem, and the worthy ancestor of a well known Charlton family. Zion Chapel. \u2014 The Bible Christians, another branch of the Wesleyan Connexion, for many years found a footing at Zion Chapel,* in Upper Market Street, but in 1886 they migrated to a superior temple in Herbert Road, Plumstead. Union Chapel. \u2014 Union Independent Chapel, in Sun Street, originated with the Roman Catholics in 1815. The ground upon which it stands was taken on lease for ninety-four years, commencing January 1, 1816, at \u00a316 per annum, from John Long by Tobias Conway. The Roman Catholics soon removing to New Road, an agreement was entered into by Mr. James Downes with Mr. Conway on August 1, 1818, to take the building and ground on lease at \u00a366 per annum, with the option of purchasing the chapel for \u00a31,000. The building was altered and fitted up and opened in October, 1818, and, as some of the principal persons in the congregation were Churchmen, the prayers of the Church of England were used. A minister was sought in the connection of the Countess of Huntingdon, and the Rev. Thomas Sharp, M.A., was chosen in 1819. He laboured with success until July, 1833, when he became minister of Crown Street Chapel, Westminster. Mr. Sharp during his ministry of fourteen years resided in Brewer Street, next tbe Wesleyan chapel, where he kept a first-class school for boys.y Church prayers were discontinued at Union Chapel during the latter part of his ministry, and never resumed. * Now a school. t The iron frame which supported the school bell remained in situ until a few years since. The school occupied two houses."], [319, "WOOLWICH. 193 The Rev. George Necton, of Dursley, succeeded Mr. Sharp on July 9, 1834, but resigned in July, 1836, and went to Norwich. The Rev. H. Jenkins came next, February 22, 1837, but he also resigned in the autumn of 1840 to settle at Chelsea, and the congregation began to languish. It was at this juncture that negotiations were opened for an alliance with Providence (afterwards Carmel) Chapel in New Road, the lease of which was nearly out, and under tbe pastorate of the Rev. W. Woodlands. The chapel was repewed and reopened under the name of \" Union \" Chapel, March 5, 1841. On the retirement of Mr. Wood lands he was succeeded by the Rev. R. B. Isaacs, who was followed by the Rev. John Richards, at the close of whose ministry the trustees handed the church over for the remnant of tbe lease to the Primitive Methodists, and they are still in occupation. The Primitive Methodists and Bible Christians will be historically treated under the head of Plumstead. Beresford Street Chapel. \u2014 Beresford Street Chapel was built in 1840 for \" the Wesleyan Association,\"* an offspring of tbe Wesleyan chapel in William Street, the trustees and leading spirits being Messrs. Johnson, Ph\u0153nix, Featherstone, Hiskins, and Truin. Joseph Street Chapel, \u2014 A few years afterwards Joseph Street Chapel was erected for the same body of Christians, and conducted by the same leaders. This chapel has recently become a Baptist place. There have been many other movements of a religious character set on foot by various sects and independent bodies, and the public balls have oeen many times used for more or less ambitious efforts to found new congregations. Chanting in Chapel. \u2014 I may note that the practice of chanting now adopted by various nonconformist bodies appears to have been introduced into Woolwich at a service held at tbe Lecture Hall, Nelson Street, on Sunday, January 6, 1856, under the leadership of the Rev. John Cox, formerly minister of Queen Street Baptist Chapel. The canticles sung were, \"0 come, let us sing\" (Psalm xcv.) and \"God be merciful\" (Psalm lxvii.). The Roman Catholics.\u2014 The Roman Catholic community at Wool wich was not numerous at the beginning of the present century, and its chronicles are likewise few. According to the annals of the Church there appears to have been a chapel or place of meeting in or near St. Mary Street, and unimpeachable authority points to the chapel in Sun Street, but prior to 1815 the Catholics had no place of worship nearer than Greenwich. The chapel bears the name of \" The United Methodist Free Church.\""], [320, "194 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. About 1817, when the Wesleyans had quitted their old meeting house in New Road, the Roman Catholics took the building and con verted it into their church,* in which they worshipped until 1843. The Government gave, both to them and to tbe Presbyterians, sites of ground adjacent in New Road in 1842, and the Catholic journal, Orthodox, had the following announcement on September 24th of that year : \u2014 St. Peter's Catholic CHURcn, Woolwich. \u2014 We have the happiness to inform our readers that the erection of this sacred edifice will soon commence. The intended church will be worthy of its designer, Mr. Pugin. The Catholic population at Wool wich numbers 3,000 souls, and the present dilapidated chapel will not admit more than 400. On Sunday evening, the 2nd of next month, a meeting will be held at the Duchess of Wellington, t Green's End, Woolwich, and a collection made. The first priests at Woolwich were the Rev. Mr. Staples and the Rev. Mr. Nightingale. The latter, I believe, was accustomed to walk down from London for Sunday services fasting, and he would walk back to London again. This, of course, was long before railways. The Rev. Mr. Cole \u2014 \" Father Cole \" he was universally called \u2014 came next, and he held the charge for about eighteen years. The Rev. J. Cotter succeeded Father Cole in October, 1858. The schools adjoining were built upon the site of the old \" Gun \" Tavern, which stood between the Catholic and the Scotch Church until 1854, when it was purchased by the Government and tbe ground given for its present purpose. The trade of the \" Gun \" was then transferred to another house, erected on part- of the site of the old Carmel (formerly Providence) Chapel, some sixty yards north. * See Plate XIL, page 66. + It was the common practice for the priests and people to meet after service on Sundays at the house of Mr. O'Dwyer, the Duchess of Wellington tavern, and discuss the affairs of the church. Such meetings are now held in the schools."], [321, "Richard Lovelace. CHAPTER XVIII GENIUS. The Poet Lovelace. \u2014 Woolwich has given birth to more than its share of remarkable men. Of these the martial muster-roll engrosses the most heroic, as, for especial instance, the immortal Gordon, whose brief memoir ajopears elsewhere. But it must also be allowed that the native genius of tbe place has gained victories other than of war. Beyond those whose deeds will be recounted in these pages, there are unquestionably some who by intellectual rank alone call for particular pedestals in our gallery of fame. The first in all grades of precedence, Richard Lovelace, distinguished both with pen and sword, was born at' Woolwich in 1618, the fifteenth year of James I., and the year in which bold Raleigh lost his head. His father, Sir William Lovelace,* had an estate and residence here, but it seems impossible at present to determine its precise locality. Sir William, I find, was baptized at Canterbury Cathedral in 1583. He was knighted by James I. in 1609. He married Anne, sister of Sir William Barne (or Barnes) of Woolwich. t His illustrious son, Richard * The Lovelaces resided at Woolwich for several generations, and are mentioned in the records on various occasions. + Sir William Barnes, and others of his family, are also frequently named."], [322, "196 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Lovelace, is said to have been the most handsome, most accomplished, and bravest of all tbe noble spirits that shone during the unhappy reign of Charles L, and, like many more, he wasted bis fortune and ruined his life in the service of that ill-fated king. His biographer has lavished upon him unmeasured praise, but several other writers of the period are fully as complimentary. The following story of Lovelace's life is extracted from Wood's account : \u2014 Richard Lovelace, the eldest son of Sir William Lovelace, of Woollidge, in Kent, Knight, was born in that county in 1618, educated in grammar learning in Charter house School, near London, became a gent, commoner of Gloucester Hall* in the beginning of 1634, and in his sixteenth year, being then accounted the most amiable and beautiful person that ever eye beheld ; a person also of innate modesty, virtue, and courtly deportment, which made him then, but especially after, when he retired to the great city, much admired and adored by the female sex. In 1636, when the King and Queen were for some days entertained at Oxon, he was, at the request of a great lady belonging to the Queen, actually created Master of Arts, though but of two years' standing, at which time his conversation being made public, and thereby his ingenuity and generous soul discovered, he became as much admired by the male as before by the female sex. Lovelace subsequently turned soldier, and fought in the Scotch ex pedition of 1639, after which he retired to his estate at Bethersden, near Canterbury, which brought him an income of \u00a3500 a year. About this time, being on tbe commission of the peace, he was selected at the County Assize to deliver to tbe House of Commons the famous Eentish petit-ion for the restoration of the King's rights and for settling the government. For this service be was on April 30, 1642, committed to the Gatehouse gaol at Westminster, and while a prisoner there he wrote his immortal song, \" To Althea.\" When love with unconfined wings Hovers within my gates, And my divine Althea brings To whisper at the grates ; When I lie. tangled in her hair And fetter'd to her eye, The birds that wanton in the air Know no such liberty. When flowing cups run swiftly round With no allaying Thames, Our careless heads with roses bound, Our hearts with loyal flames ; When thirsty grief in wine we steep, When health and draughts go free, Fishes that tipple in the deep Know no such liberty. * He matriculated at Gloucester Hall, June 27, 1634, as \"filius Gul.

Stone walls do not a prison make, Nor iron bars a cage ; Minds innocent and quiet take That for an hermitage. If I have freedom for my love And in my soul am free, Angels alone that soar above Enjoy such liberty. After a few months' incarceration Lovelace was released on heavy bail, and was forbidden to leave London, where it is too sure that he lived beyond his income and was too generous, not only in the King's cause, but in the entertainment of his friends. His brothers too he assisted, and as, like himself, they were soldiers, they were greatly in need of means to support the troops of an impoverished State. In 1646 he formed a regiment for the service of the French king and was its colonel, but was wounded at Dunkirk, and coming home, in 1648, with his brother Dudley, then a captain under him, they were both imprisoned in the Peter-house, London. It was in this durance that he framed the poems afterwards published with the title of \" Lucastra,\" which was the fanciful name of Lucy Sacheverell, a lady of beauty and fortune of whom he was enamoured, and to whom he wrote, when going to the wars, the well-known lines \u2014 \u25a0 Tell me not, sweet, I am unkind, That from the nunnerie Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind To wars and arms I fly. True, a new mistress now I chase, The first foe in the field ; And with a stronger faith embrace A sword, a horse, a shield. Vi-t this inconstancy is such As you too shall adore ; I could not love thee, dear, so much Lov'd I not honour more. Lucy Sacheverell, however, was inconstant too, for, hearing that he had died of his wounds at Dunkirk, she hastily married another wooer, and Lovelace appears to have been much affected by her fickleness. After the execution of Charles be was set at liberty, but, although still young, his life was waning. He had consumed his estate, and, as his health declined, he became melancholy, ragged, and miserable, lodging in obscure and dirty places, and biding himself and his sorrows even from the charity of his former friends. He died in a very mean lodging in Gunpowder Alley, near Shoe Lane, and was buried amongst his kins-"], [327, "199 WOOLWICH. men in St. Bride's Church in 1658, having lived barely forty years. It is believed that he married his \" Althea \" after Lucastra's desertion, and that his daughter Margaret subsequently married Henry Coke, son of the Chief Justice, and ancestor to the Earls of Leicester. His brothers, Francis, Thomas, and Dudley, all partook in some degree of his poetic fire. Colonel Francis Lovelace wrote some congratulatory verses on the pub lication of the \" Lucastra,\" in which he describes Richard as his \" best brother : \" \u2014 So, my best brother, if unto your nam I offer up a thin, blue-burning flame, Pardon my love, since none can make thee shine Unless they kindle first their torch at thine. Thomas Lovelace, another brother, wrote an elegy, \" On my brother,\" with less guarded extravagance : \u2014 Lovelace is dead ! then let the world return To its first chaos, muffled in its urn The stars and elements together lie Drench'd in perpetual obscurity, And the whole machine in confusion be As imniethodic as an anarchy. * * * # * The youngest of his brothers (Dudley Wallace) also wrote an epitaph in more modest strain, and has left several other of his literary efforts, one of which, addressed \" To my dear brother, Colonel Bichard Love lace,\" is as follows : \u2014 I'll do my nothing too, and try To dabble to thy memory. Not that I offer to thy name Encomiums of thy lasting fame. Those by the landed have been writ : Mine's but a younger-brother wit. A wit that's huddled up in scars, Borne like my rough self in the wars. And, as a squire in the fight Serves only to attend the knight, So 'tis my glory in this field, When others act, to bear thy shield.\" Sir Egerton Bridges is responsible for the following pedigree of the Lovelace family, which was given in the Gentleman's Magazine for December, 1791, and assumes the hypothesis that Lovelace and Althea were wedded : \u2014"], [328, "200 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT.

His friend Cotton wrote of him \u2014 His youth an abstract of the world's best parts, Inured to arms and exercised in arts ; Good as the best in both, and great ; but yet No dangerous courage nor offensive wit. Andrew Marvell also wrote \u2014 But when the beauteous ladies came to know That their dear Lovelace was endangered so ; Lovelace that thaw'd the most congealed breast, He who loved best and them defended best.

The Poets Of Nightingale Vale. \u2014 William Wordsworth the poet dwelt for awhile in Nightingale Vale, Woolwich, just by the boundary line which divides Woolwich and Plumstead. The house in which he resided is now No. 3, Nightingale Place, and stands facing Brook Hill Road, looking north. The adjoining houses, opposite the Lord Clyde, have been rebuilt, but this remains undisturbed, the easternmost of the old buildings. A gentleman named Quillinan occupied the house, and was the poet's intimate friend, and after wards his son-in-law. Wordsworth and Quillinan. \u2014 Sir Edward Perrott, Bart., to whom I am indebted for much in formation on manifold subjects, was invited by bis neighbour Quillinan to meet Wordsworth, who had ad mired the beautiful grounds of Brook Hill Park, and was enraptured with the nightingales \" and the full choir which woke the leafy groves.\" Tbe nightingales occasionally visit tbe spot still, and have left it a name which will have sweet associations while tbe name survives. Edward Quillinan was himself no mean poet, as his published works testify. The nightingale enchanted him also, and thus in one of bis poems he apostrophises melodious Philomel : \u2014 But hush, poor bird, thy clamorous suit, And thou, whom day offends, be mute ! For hark, the vernal notes awake From yonder lone neglected brake. Dear, musical, enthusiast, hail ! Unmatched, poetic, Nightingale. And in a note he says \u2014 I wish to take the opportunity in good time of preventing the charge, which may otherwise be brought against me, of having stolen from a golden treasury, and unskil fully alloyed and debased the coin by converting Mr. Wordsworth's description of the Nightingale to my own use. This has been long written and printed, and it was only very recently that I saw Mr. Wordsworth's beautiful verses on the Nightingale for the first time. Wordsworth's style was, however, quite distinct : \u2014 And hark, the Nightingale begins its song, \" Most musical, most melancholy \" bird ! A melancholy bird 1 0 idle thought ; In nature there is nothing melancholy."], [330, "202 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. So many Nightingales : and far and near, In wood and thicket over the wide grove They answer, and provoke each other's songs With skirmish and capricious passagings ; And murmurs musical and swift jug-jug, And one low-piping sound more sweet than all. Quillinan was originally an officer of the 3rd Dragoons, but he was always warmly attached to literature, and bis propensity for writing got him into some trouble, including two or three duels with brother officers. He served in the war with France, and on its conclusion, in 1816, he made the acquaintance of a mutual spirit, Sir Egerton Bridges, of Graves of tlie Wordsworth Family in Grassmcre Churchyard, Denton Court, Kent, whose daughter Jemima he married. Quillinan's second daughter, Botha, had Wordsworth for her godfather, as his well known sonnet testifies : \u2014 \u25a0 Rotha, my spiritual child, this head was grey When at the sacred font for thee I stood ; Pledged till thou reach the verge of womanhood, And shalt become thine own sufficient stay ; Too late, I feel, sweet orphan, was the day For steadfast hope that contract to fulfil ; Yet shall my blessing hover o'er thee still, Embodied in the music of this lay, Breathed forth beside the peaceful mountain stream,* The River Rotha, which flows into Windermere."], [331, "WOOLWICH. 203 Whose murmur soothed thy languid mother's ear After her throes ; this stream of name more dear Since thou doth bear it\u2014 a memorial theme For others ; for thy future self, a spell To summon fancies out of Time's dark cell. Quillinan's young wife was burnt to death by her clothes catching fire in 1822, and the sad event cast a gloom over his life. Nineteen years elapsed, during the later part of which time he lived at Woolwich,* and then he married Wordsworth's daughter Dora,t doomed, alas, to lose her also by death after a short six years. This was in 1841, and ten more years covered the duration of his second loneliness. He died in Westmoreland on July 12th, 1851, aged sixty years. Words worth died in 1849, aged eighty. Robert Bloomfield. \u2014 Robert Bloomfield, poet, also spent some of his most restful and hapjoy days at Woolwich, and is believed to have resided in the vicinity of Nightingale Vale. He married a Woolwich girl, as we may find from the preface to an edition of his poems published in 1809, which was during his lifetime. In this is quoted a letter from his Robt rt Bloomfield brother George, showing that not only Robert, but one of his brothers found a wife here : \u2014 * Sir Edward Perrott thought it w*as in 1835 that he met Wordsworth. Speaking of Rotha Quillinan he says : \" You revive my memory about the pretty fair-haired rather ruddy girl. She and her sister were elegant and cordial in manners. They did not mix with the military of that date, but wished to live retired, and I was the more gratified that they liked to roam about the Roughs and some parts of our grounds, from whence you could see down the Thames.\" t To whom in her childhood Wordsworth wrote his poem on the longest day. commencing \u2014 - \" Dora, sport as now thou sportest On this platform light and free ; Take thy bliss while longest, shoitest Are indifferent to thee.\" To whom also he wrote that address \u2014 \" Hast thou then survived, Meek offspring of infirm humanity ! In that Being's sight From whom the Race of human-kind proceed A thousand years are but as yesterday.\""], [332, "204 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. As my brother Nat had married a Woolwich woman it happened that Robert took a fancy to Mary Anne Church, a young woman of that town, whose father is a boat-builder in the Government yard there. He married 12th December, 1790. Soon after he married Robert told me he had sold his fiddle and got a wife. Like most poor men, he got a wife first and had to get household stuff afterward.\" Bloomfield, as we know, suffered much from ill health, and in a note to his poem on Shooters' Hill, he says : \u2014 Sickness may be often an incentive to poetical composition ; I found it so ; and I \u2022-(\u2022\u2022em the following lines only because they remind me of past feelings which I would not willingly forget. SHOOTERS' HILL To hide me from the public eye, To keep the throne of reason clear, Amidst fresh air to breathe or die, I took my staff and wandered here ; Suppressing every sigh that heaveR And coveting no wealth but thee, I nestle in the honied leaves And hug my stolen liberty. O'er eastward uplands, gay or rude, Along to Eritb's ivied spire, I start with strength and hope renewed And cherish life's rekindling fire ; Now measure vales with straining eyes, Now trace the churchyard's humble names, Or climb brown heaths * that upward rise And overlook the winding Thames. * # -*-*. * Sweet health, I seek thee ! hither bring Thy balm that softens human ills ; Come on the long-drawn clouds that fling Their shadows o'er the Surrey hills ; Yon green-topped hills, and far away Where late as now I freedom stole, And spent one dear delicious day On thy wild banks, romantic Mole. Aye, there's the scene !t beyond the sweep Of London's congregated cloud ; The dark-brow'd wood, the headlong steep, And valley paths without a crowd ! Here, Thames, I watch thy flowing tides, Thy thousand sails am proud to see ; But where the Mole all silent glides DweUs peace \u2014 and peace is wealth to me. * Plumstead and BostaU Commons. t Leith Hill and Box Hill, in the neighbourhood of Dorking. ,"], [333, "AVOOLWICH. 205 This far-seen monumental tower- Records th' achievements of the brave, And Angra's subjugated power Who plundered on the eastern w*ave.

Robert Bloomfield was born on the 3rd of December, 1766, and died on the 19th of August, 1823, aged fifty-six. One of his biographers says of him \u2014 A sweeter kindlier soul never laid down the burden of an unequal strife. Richard Ruegg. \u2014 Mr. Ruegg, who also resided in Nightingale Vale, was the author of many fugitive poems, most of which appeared in the columns of the Kentish Independent. It has been said that his intellect should have been given entirely to literary work instead of being spent upon sanitary science, but no mind can be degraded by devotion to those pursuits which give health and happiness to the people. The following verses on \" The Maids of Kent \" were among his early productions : \u2014 The maids of Kent, the maids of Kent \u2014 The pencil hath no art To shadow forth in all their grace These idols of the heart !

A newspaper of February 2nd, 1824, reports : \u2014 The admired actress, Mrs. Hart ley, died on Monday last, at her house in Woolwich, aged seventy three. She was cotemporary with Garrick, and her beauty, com bined with the truth and nature of her acting, caused her to rank as the highest lady in her pro fession.

Holden Jones, a butcher.\" By this clue we may trace Paine's residence to a little shop down steps which occupied the site of No. 24, High Street, near Glass Yard. William Cobbett.\u2014 It is rather remarkable that William Cobbett, the quaint politician and eccentric writer, who was in the early part of his literary career Paine's most vehement opponent, was also associated with Woolwich whilst serving Tom Paine. in the army.

Cobbett, who attacked Paine under the noni de plume of \" Peter Porcupine,\" changed his mind and apologised after Paine's death. Paine died June Sth, 1809, aged seventy-two years. William Cobbett was born at Farnham, in Surrey, in 1762. He enlisted at Chatham in a line regiment in 1784, and a year later went to Nova Scotia, where be remained until 1791. He there saw his future wife, who was then but thirteen years of age, while he was twenty one. She was the daughter of a sergeant-major of ar tillery, and he a sergeant major of a regiment of foot. Her beauty and industry combined to draw him to- wards her. Early one morn ing he saw her out on the snow scrubbing a tub, and exclaimed, \" That's the girl Six months after their first JVilliam Cobbett. for me.\" He never repented his choice. meeting the battery of artillery was sent home to Woolwich, and his sweetheart went with her father, but Cobbett gave her all bis savings \u2014 i'150 \u2014 and told her to make use of it as her own. Two years after he came home, and, repairing at once to Woolwich, found his girl in the situation of servant to Captain Brisac at \u00a35 a year, but she put into his hands the whole of the \u00a3150. The register of Woolwich Church records their marriage on tbe 5th of February, 1792. It is declared of this remarkable man that, amid all his trials and difficulties, his domestic life was one of uninterrupted bliss. He died on June 18, 1835, near his birthplace. Joey Grimaldi. \u2014 Grimaldi, the famous clown, resided at 6, Pros pect Row, Woolwich, and the house (now 23, George Street) is standing as it was in his time, a few doors from the Trafalgar Tavern. Joseph Grimaldi was born in London in 1779, and resided there until Michaelmas, 1832, when he took No. 6, Prospect Row.

An incident of his life, which I have seen narrated in his biographies, was his appear ance as a witness at Staffordshire Assizes to prove an alibi for a man charged with murder, whose ac quittal he secured by showing that on the day of the murder he, Grimaldi, played at Woolwich, and saw the accused there.* Joe Grimaldi Tom Hood the elder wrote an ode on Grimaldi, and probably had \" Prospect Row \" in his mind when he penned this verse : \u2014 Joseph, thou hast left the stage.

An early notice which appeared in 1857, accom panied by tbe portrait on next page, tells us that \u2014 \" Sims Reeves's first instructor was his father, who. detecting very early indications of musical genius in the boy, did all that lay in his power to foster them. Before he reached his fourteenth year Sims Reeves had attained considerable proficiency on several instruments, and applied himself with success to the theory of composition. His acquaintance with the organ and with church music was so remarkable, even at that period, that it led to his appointment as organist and director of the choir at the church of North Cray, in Kent ; and while holding that office he wrote chants and * The date was March 13th, 1807. t The house still stands behind the theatre."], [338, "210 RECORDS OF THE AVOOLWICH DISTRICT. anthems which would have done no discredit to composers of repute. He continued to study the theory of music under a well-known master, and took lessons on tin pianoforte from the celebrated John Cramer. He was next placed under the care of a distinguished professor of singing, and from that moment the other branches ofhis musical education were generally abandoned. The bent of his mind was evidently towards dramatic singing, and after a long course of assiduous study he made his first appearance on the stage ofthe theatre at Newcastle. This was in 1839, when he was in his nineteenth year, and had duly cultivated what was then considered a barytone voice.\" Sims Reeves made (I believe) bis first public appearance at a sacred concert given by Mr. McKenzie, the Royal Artillery bandmaster, at Woolwich in 1834. A book of words used on that occasion is in my possession. It was printed byE. Jones, Thomas Street (afterwards Kentish Independent office), and is entitled \" Selection of Sacred Music to be performed at the Royal Artillery Chapel, Woolwich, on Tuesday, 23rd December, 1834.\" A list of tbe choir is given, in which will be found many well-re membered names in com pany with those of young Reeves and his father: \u2014 Treble. \u2014 Masters Wells, Reeves. jun., Wilkinson, jun., J.

Mrs. Julia Lennox. Mr. Ludwig Siedle, their father, kept a jeweller's shop at 17, Thomas Street, Woolwich, and it is a remarkable fact that this same house was formerly occupied by Mr. McKenzie, tbe Royal Artillery bandmaster just mentioned, and that here Sims Reeves came to take lessens of him. On November 3, 1886, I had the pleasure of seeing and hearing Sims Reeves and tbe two Siedles (Phillipiue and Mrs. Lennox) associated together in the three leading parts of the Beggars' Opera at the Avenue Theatre. Another strange coincidence is this : Sims Reeves, the Siedles, and Frederick Leslie, not to mention a host of other actors, all gained their earliest fame in the same build ing ; for the Garrison Theatre, be it remembered, was formerly tbe Garrison Church, in which Reeves sang as a boy under bis father's tuition. Miss Phillipine Siedle has been constantly associated with Mr. Sime Reeves in his later concerts and dramatic performances. Her portrait appears on Plate H, page 197. Fred. Leslie. \u2014 Mr. Frederick Leslie was born on April 1, 1855, at 49, Artillery Place, Woolwich, where his father founded a well known and extensive trade of military outfitting, since removed to London. Our successful young actor has been tbe subject of many published biographical notices, and I choose one of these in preference to recording, under the influence of a close personal friendship, my own impressions. I select the following from a theatrical journal, Under the Clock, in which it appeared on December 13, 1884 : \u2014 Mr. Frederick Leslie commenced his dramatic career at the precocious age of eight. He had long occupied himself with the construction of paper scenery and puppet actors, and at length an opportunity occurred for making a debut upon real boards. It came about in this w*ay : a wooden fence which divided his father's garden from some adjoining premises happened to be levelled, and it occurred to some stage- struck companions and himself that a real theatre might be built from the planks which lay about temptingly idle. Some gas-pipes were obtained as a support for the stage, which had, however, to be chalked in parts where dangerous to tread, and the place was roofed roughly in after the manner of fair-booths which the youthful archi- tects had somewhere seen. Young Leslie set himself diligently to work to write the play, all the characters being played by boys. This first effort of the juvenile play- wright has not been preserved, but its name was II 'allt r's Ruin, the said Walker being murdered in the first act, much to his disappointment, and under strong protest, as he was naturally ambitious to keep himself as a leading character well before the public till the fall of the curtain. The boys had expended all their pocket-money in preparations for the forthcoming piece, ami, at the last moment, it was discovered that they had no lights, when they conceived the brilliant idea of making a charge of one farthing for admission to the show. As the money flowed into the treasury it was at once expended in candles, till at length, as the theatre became full, it presented a blaze of splendour. Mr. Leslie was destined for the profession of an architect, but"], [342, "212 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. it was little to his taste, and when quite a youth in his teens he was playing as an amateur, and before he was twenty had undertaken leading Shakespearian parts. His first engagement in the great regular army of which he had long been an enthu siastic volunteer was at the Royalty under Kate Santley's management. He presented himself as an impersonator of old men's parts, and is firmly convinced that a thick stick which he carried, and thumped vigorously upon the ground while he read the part of Colonel Hardy in Paul Pry before the manageress, secured him his first en gagement. When asked what salary he wanted, he modestly mentioned a pound a week, subsequently raised to two pounds, to which an extra five shillings was afterwards added as an appropriate remuneration for ' a voice ' of which he was dis covered to be the fortunate possessor. Mr. Leslie next obtained a two years' engage ment, which included a provincial tour under Madame Dolaro, at the Folly, now Toole's Theatre, for a season of comic opera. From thence he migrated to the Alhambra, where, sure sign of a rising actor's success, he doubled his salary in twelve months. Here he played with a great success Due della Volta in LaFille du Tambour Major, Faust in Herve's Mephistopheles II. (Little Dr. Faust), Briolet in Jeanne, Jean nette, and Jeanneton, with other parts. He made next a tour through the States extending over eight months. Mr. Leslie has drifted rather than gone of set purpose into the line of comic opera. It was only the accidental discovery that he possessed a voice which diverted him from the Shakespearian parts and the more serious drama, to that lighter vein of opera created almost by composers like Offenbach, Suppe, and Strauss, and of which after only six years from his debut he had become one of the best exponents on the English stage. Not but that very tempting opportunities have often presented themselves to induce him to return to his first histrionic love, Shake speare. When in the States, before the vision of beautiful Mary Anderson appeared on the Lyceum stage, Mr. Leslie was invited by her step-father and manager to play Romeo to her Juliet, when we should certainly have seen a Romeo of as noble a presence as any that have trod the London boards, and a fit mate to a Juliet of matchless beauty ; but the offer was declined by Mr. Leslie. He is exceedingly popular both within and without the profession, and has been cordially recognised by the most distinguished patrons of art. On a memorable occasion Mr. Irving paid him the high compliment of inviting him to be present at a supper which he gave to the Prince of Wales and a select few on the stage of the Lyceum. During his first visit to America, Mr. Leslie was cabled to by M. Marius to appear at the opening of the new Avenue Theatre, as the Marquis de Ponsable in a revival of Madame Fa/vart ; and he also appeared here in Les Manteaux Noirs. In Rip van Winkle, at the Comedy, he had a run of over three hundred nights. A second visit to America followed, when he made a marked success in The Beggar Student, Madame Favart, and other pieces. Mr. Leslie possesses all the qualifications for success in the leading roles of comic opera \u2014 a handsome, manly face, a noble stage-figure, which lends itself admirably to the impersonation of the stage hero. He speaks his part with irre proachable purity of tone and accent. He is a thorough gentleman upon as well as off the stage, and, added to all, he possesses a voice full of melody and power, and he is never guilty either of the affectation of aiming at a style of singing appropriate to more serious opera, or of descending to the level of the music-hall stage. He is a man of cultivated tastes, of very varied accomplishments, a genial companion, and a capital raconteur, as well as a first-rate artist. While still under thirty, he has reached the very front rank of his profession. As the romantic hero of operetta, he stands without a rival on the English stage. In 1888 Mr. Leslie went on a tour through Australia and America with the Gaiety company at a salary of \u00a3100 per week, and received an invitation to return to the Antipodes at twice tbe figure."], [343, "WOOLWICH. 213 Edward Terry. \u2014 The now famous Edward Terry fulfilled one of his first engagements at the Theatre in Beresford Street, Woolwich. He says : \u2014 The young actor has no such training school now as he had under the old order of things.

Other Stars. \u2014 Of the many other living artists whose names are asso ciated with Woolwich we may mention Madame Amadi, better known by her professional name of Miss Annie Tremaine, but still more readily recognised here, her birthplace, as Miss Creelman. Mrs. Willurd {nie Waters) was born and reared in St. Mary Street, and several well-known actors have old associations with the place, amongst them being Mr. Arthur Dacre (a surgeon and assistant to Di*. Butler of Woolwich Common) and Mr. Graham, who was Mr. Modlock, master of St. John's Schools. The last-named is now engaged chiefly in America, as is also Mr. Harry Morgan, another younger son of Wool wich, a rising star full of promise. The \"inimitable\" Mackney in bis early days played the violin in the orchestra at Woolwich Theatre for a weekly salary of fifteen shillings. Charles Bannerman, the professional cricketer of Australia, was born at Woolwich in 1852. He is described in the \"Sporting Annual\" of 1881 as a splendid batsman, with tremendous batting powers, and a rapid scorer. Drives very hard, is a first-class point, and can bowl at an emergency. Height 5 ft. 8 ins. The Woolwich Powder Boy. \u2014 Here is one of solid and lasting fame. Henry Maudslay (says Samuel Smiles, the author of \"Self Help,\" &c.) was born at Woolwich towards the end of the last century, in a house standing in the court at the back of the Salutation Inn, the entrance to which is nearly opposite the Arsenal gates. His father was a native of Lancashire, descended from an old family of the same name, the head of which resided at Mawdsley Hall, near Ormskirk, at the be- ginning of the seventeenth century. The family were afterwards scattered, and several of its members became workmen. William Maudslay, the father of Henry, belonged to the neighbourhood of Bolton, where he was brought up to the trade of a joiner. Having got into trouble in his neighbourhood through some alleged liaison, William enlisted in the Royal Artillery, and the corps to which he belonged was shortly after sent out to the West Indies. He was several times engaged in battle, and in his last action he was hit by a musket-ball in the throat. The soldier's stock which he wore had a piece cut out of it by the ball, the direction of which was diverted ; and, though severely wounded, his life was saved. He brought home the stock, and preserved it as a relic, afterwards leaving it to his son. Long after, the son would point to the stock, hung up against the wall, and say, \" But for that bit of leather there would have been no Henry Maudslay.\" The wounded artilleryman was invalided and sent home to Woolwich, the head-quarters of his corps, where he was shortly after dis-"], [344, "214 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. charged. Being a handy workman he sought and obtained employment at the Arsenal. He was afterwards appointed a storekeeper in the Dockyard. It was during the former stage of William Maudslay's employment at Woolwich that the subject of this memoir was born in the house in the court above mentioned on the 22nd of August, 1771. The boy was early set to work. When twelve years old he was employed ac a \"powder monkey \"in making and filling cartridges. After two years he was passed on to the carpenters' shop where his father worked, and there he became acquainted with tools and the art ol working in wood and iron. From the first the latter seems to have had by far the greater charms for him. The blacksmiths' shop was close to the carpenters', and Harry seized every opportunity that offered of plying the hammer, the file, and the chisel, in preference to the saw and tbe plane. Many a cuff did the foreman of carpen ters give him for absenting himself from his proper shop and stealing off to the smithy. At the end of a year it was thought better to yield to his earnest desire, and he was re moved to the smithy in his fifteenth year. His heart being now in his work, he made rapid pro gress, and soon became an expert smith. His skill was especially in forging light iron work, and a favourite job was making \"trivets\" out of the solid, which only the \" dab - hands \" of the shop could do, Birthplace of Henry Maudslay in Salutation .Alley, Woolwich. but which he threw off with great rapidity in first-rate style. Even at the close of his life, when he had acquired eminent distinction as an inventor and was a large employer of skilled labour, he looked back with pride to the forging of his early days in Woolwich Arsenal. He used to describe with much gusto how the old experienced hands, with whom he was a great favourite, would crowd about him when forging his trivets, some of which may to this day be in use among Woolwich housewives for supporting the toastplate before the bright fire. This, however, was entirely contraband work, done \"on the sly,\" and strictly prohibited by the superintending officer, who used kindly to signal his approach by blowing his nose in a peculiar manner, so that all forbidden jobs might be put out of the way The manual skill of the young blacksmith gave him considerable reputation, and he was spoken of in the London shops as one of"], [345, "AVOOLWICH. 215 the most dexterous hands in the trade. It was this circumstance thai shortly ledtohi removal from Woolwich Arsenal. Joseph Bramah took out the first patent for his lock in 1784, and consulted an old German artizan in Whitechapel, reckoned one o! the most ingenious workmen in London, with 'tin; object of securing precise work manship in lock-making. But they could not solve the problem, and Bramah began to fear that his lock would become a mechanical curiosity, when one of the German's fellow-workmen ventured to suggest that there was a young man in Woolwich Arsenal named Maudslay, who was so clever that \" nothing bet him.\" Maudslay was at oni e sent for, and appeared before lhe lockmaker\u2014 a tall, strong, comely young fellow, then only eighteen years of age. Bramah was almost ashamed to lay his case before such a mere youth, but necessity constrained him, and the replies were so modest, sensible. and practical, that Bramah adopted the youth's suggestions and offered to give him a job He soon took rank in Bramah's workshop, for his manual dexterity was the least of his gifts. He was not only the favourite, but the hero of the shop. \" Perhaps he owed something to his fine personal appearance, for on gala days it was \" Harry who marched at the head and carried the flag. His conduct as a son was as admi rable as his qualities as a workman. His father dying shortly after he went to London, he was accustomed to walk down to Woolwich every Saturday and hand over to his mother, for whom he bad the tendersst regard, a considerable share of his week's wages, and this he continued to do as long as she lived Bramah admitted that to Maudslay 's skill he owed in a great degree his success, but, even after making him manager of his works, he declined to advance his wages beyond 30s. a week, and Maudslay, having married and found the cares of a family, determined to start on his own account. He began in a small shop in Wells Street, Oxford Street, and success soon followed. His inventions were many, including the well-known \"slide rest,\" the influence of which upon machinery his pupil Nasmyth has likened to the influence ofthe steam-engine on manufactures and commerce. Maudslay soon became acquaint'*. I with the famous Brunei, and removed eventually to his great factory in the West minster Road, Lambeth. The rest of his wonderful career it is unnecessary to trace. He was the beau ideal of an honest, upright, straightforward, hardworking, and intel ligent Englishman. Maudslay's Tomb. \u2014 Henry Maudslay's death occurred from a cold on the 14th of February, 1831. By bis direction he was buried in Woolwich Churchyard, where a cast-iron tomb made to his own design was erected over his remains. It stands on the summit of the north enclosure, where it can be seen from the public foot-path. A Lover of Woolwich. \u2014 Maudslay had ever a warm heart for Woolwich, and be often returned to it to refresh himself with a sight of the scenes familiar to his boyhood. He liked its green common, Shooters' Hill, with its look-out over Kent and down the valley of the Thames, the river busy with shipping, and the royal craft loading and unloading- their armaments at the wharves. He liked the elaii<rour of the Arsenal smithy, where he had first learned his art, and all the busy industry of the place. It was natural therefore that, being proud of his early connection with Woolwich, he should wish to lie there ; and Woolwich on her part, let us add, has equal reason to be proud of Henry Maudslay."], [346, "216 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. To the foregoing facts I am enabled by thc kindness of the present Mr. Henry Maudslay to add some further details respecting his famous grandfather and the Maudslay family. Our hero's father, William Maudslay, was a sergeant-wheelwright when in tbe Royal Artillery, and was married at Woolwich Church to Margaret Laundy in July, 1763. They had seven children (all born in Woolwich), of whom Henry was the fifth ; he also by his wife had seven chil dren, the eldest, Thomas Henry, having seven likewise. Sergeant Maudslay was a member of the Union (now* Union Waterloo) Lodge of Freemasons at AVool wich, and the present Henry Maudslay is a distinguished member of the Grand Lodge of England. Amongst the special inventions which made the fame of the Woolwich apprentice may be mentioned the cup leather for the hydraulic presses, and the first upright direct action steam-engine. He also obtained a reward of \u00a31,000 offered by the Government for a three-threaded screw required at the Royal Observatory. The II, nry Maudslay.

A.D. 1512. \u2014 The foregoing extracts prove beyond question that the Great Harry was built at Woolwich, and by the Crown. This being so, it requires very little conjecture or argument to establish the fact that a dockyard must have existed at Woolwich in 1512, but it must be confessed that tbe fact is not distinctly stated in any of the records. This is the more vexatious as there is an entry of this same date (1512), showing that a new dock was then constructed at the opposition port of Erith, and a \"king's schipp\" named the Soverin taken in for repairs. No one is likely to dispute, in the face of tbe foregoing documents, that Woolwich had a dockyard in 1512, and built therein the Great Harry, and we can at any rate bring direct testimony to establish the existence of tbe dock in 1514-15, by quoting from the navy accounts which appear under that date the following items : \u2014 f s. d. The Sovereign. Costs of bringing her from Erith to Woolwich, and so into her dock, and the charge of much repair 115 4 Paid by the king's command for the carting, cleansing, hedging, staking, and piling of the dock at Woolwich for the bringing in the ship called the Sovereign .... 26 0 0 Costs of carriage, and felling of tynnet stakes and piles, as well for the docks, as for shutting the head of the same 2 14 2 Costs of certain labourers dispatching the ballast J out of the Sovereign, and helping to moor the Great Barbara at Woolwich . . . .290 Paid to labourers for the shutting in the Sovereign's dock head . . .24 13 5 Felling timber, and other expenses in the Sovereign and her dock . .307 The following will go to prove that this dock was at this time a royal dock, and a permanent establishment : \u2014 A Note how many ships the King's Majesty hath in harbour on the 18th day of September, in the thirteenth year of his reign (1521), what portage they be of, what state they be in the same day, also where they ride and be bestowed.

And Brygandyn,t the clerk of the ships, doth say, that before the said ship shall be laid in the dock, it is necessary that her mast be taken down, and bestowed in the great storehouse at Erith ; and also he saith, that if the Great Henry be not housed over, in such wise that the same may be sufficiently defended from snow, rain, and sun, it shall be utterly destroyed within few* years, and also he esteemed that the charge to house it will amount to the sum of one hundred marks and above. The Sovereign, being of the portage of eight hundred tons, lyeth in a dock at Woolwich, the same being in such case that she must be new made from the keel upwards. Upon these evidences, then, it may safely be averred that a dock and! building-yard existed at Woolwich as early at least as 1512, and there is no doubt that the first of tbe long line of leviathan ships which have established and maintained the naval supremacy of Britain was here brought into being. Record so early as this has no other royal dock or place where royal ships have been builded, and I hope it will not be thought wasted space to have printed here tbe proofs which are necessary to vindicate, in this particular, the credit of Woolwich. Early Days. \u2014 Once set on foot, the young dockyard had a vigorous growth. At first it seems to have consisted merely of the building slip, with a few temporary buildings for the workmen and officers, but. King Henry continued to build and repair his ships here, and to* extend his premises. His Majesty bought a house and land, a meade, salt-house, and wharf at Woolwich in August, 1518, for \u00a3113 6s. 8d., and the same day he paid John Hopton \u00a3100 for repairing and caulking there the great galley Mary Rose, which was built here and afterwards sunk at Spithead.cjc Sir Edward Boughton. \u2014 In the thirty-seventh year of his reign, 1545, the King purchased two other parcels of land, called \" Bowton's \" (or \" Boughton's\"), from Sir Edward Boughton, who had long been his confidential clerk and local agent at Woolwich and Plumstead, and was now lord of the manor of Southall, which practically made him owner of nearly tbe whole parish. Henry afterwards bought of Sir Edward two more parcels, called \" Sandhill \" and \" Our Lady Hill.\" All these sites were, I believe, within the present enclosure, and included in the earliest limits of the infant dockyard. The name of * This refers to the dock in which, according to the next paragraph, the ship Sovereign was then lying. t Whose name was given to vessels rigged according to his suggestion. X The Mary Rose was frequently at Woolwich. In 1579 we have the following entry : \" The White Bear new repayred in Wollidge dock to a charge of \u00a3800. The Mary Roase new repayred in Wool1*-*1*- dock to a charge of \u00a3640. The storehouses at Woullwich new repayred.\""], [355, "223 WOOLWICH. \" Our Lady \" Hill has a significant relationship to that of St. Mary's Church, and was probably in close proximity. I fancy that it may have been part of the slope which we descend on the tramway from Coleman Street to Dock Rails, and the Sand Hill was either adjoining, or one of the ballast hills at the back of the town street.* It is not improbable that Bowton's docks may have been the original building yard itself, at first hired only and then purchased by the Crown. The payment of \u00a36 to Maryon Danyell t for the hire of her ground and houses, occupied by the King's timber and the Henry Grace-de-Dieu in 1512-15, helps this conjecture, for it is easy to suppose that Bough ton may have acquired the land, with the rest of his estates, in the interval. The Nucleus. \u2014 The first building-slip was probably on the spot occupied by the granite graving dock at tbe eastern end of the yard, and may originally have been a natural cleft in the land at the termi nation of the little valley which we find in St. Mary Street and Sun Street. It has been pointed out that at one time the hill on which the church stands sloped down to the water's edge. J And it would have formed the eastern side of the little estuary. There was only one building-slip for very many years. And not only are we sure that, while the Great Harry was a-build ing, Woolwich was one of the chief ports of the royal navy, but it is by no means certain that this was not the royal dockyard also during the preceding, if not several preceding, reigns. However, there are no positive proofs to offer in evidence, and the claim to priority being sufficiently established, it is not necessary to pursue the subject. After the Harry was launched, she seems to have been usually moored lower down the river, and on the llth of August, 1515, when Henry VIII. bad at Woolwich the Great Barbara, the Great Nicholas, and the John Baptist, he bad in the broad reach of Erith, the Henry Grace-de-Dieu, the Trinity Sovereign, the Gabriel Royal, the Catherine Forteleza, the Catherine Galy, the Rose Galy ; \u00a7 at Blackwall, the Mary Rose, the Peter Pome Grenade, and tbe Great Elizabeth ; and at Dept ford the Crist of Greemcich. Ancient Wages. \u2014 -From an account rendered about the same time relative to the Great Nicholas while moored at Woolwich, we find that the carpenters and others employed upon her were paid from twopence * See Plate XX., page 145. t See note, page 220.

The bill for victuals was as foUows : \u2014 \u00a3 s. d. 282 doz. of bread 14 2 0 67 pipes of beer at 0 6 8 per pipe. 28 qrs. of beef at 0 4 2 per qr. 500 dry fish .278 per 100. 800 cades of herrings at 0 5 0 per cade. 6 barrels of white herrings 0 7 0 per barrel. Henry's navy accounts have also mentioned the \" great storehouse \" at Erith. This I make out to have been an old bulk afloat. It was pro posed in 1525, as it had been in 1521, to lay the masts of the Great Harry in the storehouse at Erith. End ofthe \" Great Harry.\" \u2014 The Great Harry had a life of only thirty-eight years, and ended, as she had begun, her career at Woolwich. We read that \" the famous ship, being at Woolwich on the 27th of August, 1553, the first year of Queen Mary, by the carelessness of the mariners took fire, and was totally consumed.\" She was a magnificent vessel, but the drawings by which she is repre sented, one of which I produce, Elate XXIV., page 218, are of doubtful accuracy. Longfellow writes of her in his \" Building of the Ship \" \u2014 Above them all, strangest of all, Towered the Great Harry, crank and tall, Whose picture was hanging on the wall ; WTith bows and stern raised high in air, And balconies hanging here and there, And signal lanterns and flags afloat, And eight round towers, like those that frown From some old castle, looking down Upon the drawbridge and the moat. Early Vicissitudes. \u2014 Henry's passion for building big ships was not inherited by his children, and we hear little of Woolwich during the short reigns of either Edward VI. or Mary. Nor did the longer regime of Elizabeth and her vigorous foreign policy bring any per manent increase of employment to the town. Inconstant trade and fluctuating prosperity have been the features of the Government adop tion almost from the very beginning. Hasted tells us that in the reign of Elizabeth, as the business of tbe royal navy increased, \" new docks and launches \" were erected here ; but the good queen had a frugal mind, and, although she knew how much of her strength lay in her navy, she was a trifle parsimonious with her fleet.

It is thus recorded : \u2014 The next day, July 3, the Queen went to Woolwich, to the launching of a fine ship newly built, and called by her own name, Elizabeth. The 10th of the same month, being still at Greenwich, there was made a placejn the park for the Queen's pensioners, who were to run with spears. The challengers were three \u2014 the Earl of Ormond, Sir John Perrot, and Mr. North.* There is no doubt, however, that the Queen was idolised by her people, whose loyalty, indeed, was of quite an extravagant order. The writers of the day were accustomed to deal out unmeasured flattery of their sovereign lady, and the following verses written by Rowland on * I have given the second part of the paragraph because it contains a familiar local name."], [358, "226 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. the combined theme of the Queen and tbe Thames is a fair example of courtly language in the Elizabethan era : \u2014 0 thou silver Thames, 0 clearest crystal flood, Beta alone the ph\u0153nix is of all thy watery brood. The queene of Virgines onely she, And thou the queene of floods shall be.

Mr. Peter Pett, the master shipwright, sent to the Queen in 1586 an estimate for new buildings and reparations required at the Wool wich storehouses, and at the same time reported that Her Majesty's navy generaUy was in a very bad state, most of the ships being old and out of repair, but all capable of being fitted out for sudden service. Tbe Queen, it is well known, took a personal concern in such matters, and it is believed that in this yard she fitted, at least in part, the expe dition which in 1587 she sent out in charge of Sir Francis Drake to pillage and destroy the Spanish shipping.

It is ordered that the storehouse at Woolwich, being decayed, the arms be removed to the Tower, as they are subject to embezzlement and rust. Old Woolwich not Healthy. \u2014 Stowe, the early historian, writing in this same year (1598) says \u2014 Woolwich is seated on the Kentish side, low and not over healthful, but, by reason of its dock and storehouses for the Navy Royal, is a place well inhabited, especially by those that have their dependence thereon. Sir Walter Raleigh. \u2014 That famous seaman and adventurer, the brave, the chivalrous, the courtly Raleigh, was intimately associated with Woolwich. It is be lieved that in this dockyard bis ships were built and fitted for his expeditions to South America during the reign of Elizabeth ; and it is certain that, after his long confine ment in the Tower, his last ill-fated enterprise in 1618 was here, at least in part, prepared. Our master ship wright, Phineas Pett, in his diary, the MS. of which is still to be seen, says \u2014 About the 27th of March, 1615, I bargained with Sir Walter Raleigh to build him a ship of five hundred tons, which I procured leave from the Lord Admiral to build in the Galley Dock at Woolwich towards which I presently received \u00a3500, Sir Walter Raleigh. to begin with, and the 8th of April following I set my men to work on her. The same writer says \u2014 The 16th of December (1615), I launched the great ship of Sir Walter Raleigh's called the Destiny, and had much ado to get her into the water, but I delivered her to him afloat in good order, by which business I lost \u00a3100, and could never get any recompence for it, Sir Walter going to sea and leaving me unsatisfied. Unlucky Sir Walter had more than enough sorrow to follow. His * See Records of Royal Arsenal."], [361, "229 WOOLWICH. son was slain by the Spaniards in Guinea, and on his return to England, King James, to mollify Spain, sent Sir Walter Raleigh to the block. East India Company.- \u2014 Two years before Elizabeth's death the first expedition left for the East Indies, and laid the foundation of our vast and magnificent oriental empire. It consisted of three ships, and the records of the company state that they were fitted out at Woolwich, under Captain James Lancaster, and by virtue of a royal charter granted to the company of \"merchant adventurers.\" It was on the 15th of May, 1601, that tbe expedition was finally inspected and declared ready for its enterprise, and the three ships were the Dragon of 600 tons, Hhe Swan of the like burthen, and the Guest, a victualler of 130 tons. The soldiers, sailors, and \" merchants \" numbered 550 men, and they took with them trading stock to the value of \u00a320,000.* This was the beginning of our magnificent Indian Empire. Woolwich under James I.- \u2014 James I., who ascended the throne in 1603, did much during his remarkable reign of twenty-two years to advance the navy, and Woolwich undoubtedly made much progress. Indeed, in all its history the dockyard has experienced no years so eventful as those embraced within the earlier part of this monarchy. The gallant young Henry, Prince of Wales, the idol of tbe people, who was educated at Charlton, was never happier than when at Wool wich, and never so much at home as in its dockyard. His association with Phineas Pett, the skilful and enterprising master shipwright, had a salutary effect upon the art of naval architecture and the develop ment of this yard, and the many incidents of the period which are preserved to us by the diarists of the day are amongst the most inter esting of all the records in our collection. Royal Patronage. \u2014 We are at once struck with the* system of state patronage which was at that time accepted as the natural order of things. In 1604 (as stated at page 50) there was a grant to Hugh Lyddiard (frequently spelt \"Lydiard\" or \" Lydyard \" ) of the office of Clerk of the Checque of the Navy and works at Woolwich, and Clerk of the Storehouse there, \"for life ; \" and two years later a grant \" in reversion \" to John Jackson of the clerkship of the cheque at Wool wich, also \" for life.\" Jackson's chance seems to have been delayed until 1614, when John Acworth was granted, \"for life,\" the second half of Lyddiard's office, the care of the storehouses. These royal favours were not peculiar to this monarch, for we may find that in the following reign (Charles I.), Henrick Edisbury, who was an officer of the yard at Chatham, writes to a friend at court to say that \u2014 * See Records of Rope Walk."], [362, "230 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT.

The Story of Phineas Pett. \u2014 The records of Woolwich Dock yard underthereign of James I. have a special attraction, from the remarkable detail with which we have brought down to us the story of Phineas Pett and the King's State Trial at Woolwich. In a copious diary, still preserved in tbe original manuscript, Pett narrates not only this note worthy episode, but James I. also many incidents and vicissitudes of his chequered life. Phineas was son of Peter Pett, master shipwright at Deptford, who gave him a good education ; but, after bis father's death, he had sud denly to leave his college, in consequence of his mother having con tracted a second and imprudent marriage. He served some time with a shipwright, and then went to sea for twenty months, after which his brother Peter, who was one of Elizabeth's master shipwrights, employed him as an ordinary workman upon a vessel, The Defiance, which was in Woolwich dock, being sheathed for the voyage of Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins. This was in 1594, and in the following year he was engaged on a new ship called The Triumph. About midsummer, 1593, he tells us, there was a great stir at Woolwich, when the Eliza beth Jonas was to be launched, preparations being made to receive tbe Virgin Queen on board ; but she did not come, and the launch took place without her. After this he was out of settled service for several"], [366, "232 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. years, but spent all bis leisure in mathematics, model-making, and other educational work, tbe benefit of which came later on.

But at this juncture Phineas experienced the beginning of his troubles, for in 1608 \"an inquisition for inquiring into abuses and misdemeanours by all officers,\" was ordered to be instituted, and was made the means of his cruel persecution. Over this he triumphed, but in April, 1609, he discovered another conspiracy by the rival ship wrights and other adversaries, and at once appealed to the King for protection and a fair trial. The King thereupon sent the Lord High Admiral, with the Earls of Suffolk and Winchester, on a commission of inquiry to Woolwich, where, having heard the accusers and seen the work which they con demned, they gave Pett the full assurance of their confidence, and denounced as slander and malice the motives of his enemies. These men, however, had a strong supporter in the Earl of Northampton, who protested to the King that the inquiry had been unfair ; and His Majesty, who had an exalted opinion of his own wisdom, at once decided to hear the cause in his own gracious person, appointing Monday the 8th of May, at Woolwich, for the trial. The Royal Court at Woolwich. \u2014 Both sides made busy pre paration, and a room \u2014 the workmen's dining-room, adjoining the master shipwright's quarters \u2014 was fitted up for the King's court, Pett's own dining-room being reserved for tbe private service of His Majesty. The house of Hugh Lydiard, Clerk of tbe Cheque, was appropriated to the Lord Northampton and his party of accusers, some of whom, Pett tells us, made spiteful remarks to him before the King came, and promised him that he should be hanged within a week. Pett's narrative of the affair may now be taken up, from his MS. in the Harleian collection, as follows : \u2014 On Monday morning, the 8th of May, 1609, the Lord Admiral came betimes to Woolwich, attended by Sir Robert Mansell, Sir John Trevor, and others, where his lordship was met by all those persons who were formerly warned to be there on our part. Presently after came the Lord Northampton, attended with all the spiteful crew of his informers, and he took Hugh Lydiard's house, being Clerk of the Cheque, which was fitted for him, and was there attended with all his rabble. Before His Majesty's coming, Weymouth and all his associates pried up and down the yard, belching out nothing but disgraces and deceitful speeches. They had given out that the work should be defaced at the least, which was likely enough to have proved so had not God put a hook in their nostrils, aud, by the justice of the King, caused themselves to fall into the pit they designed for another. It would occupy too much space to relate in Mr. Pett's own words the previous proceedings, and the courses of the \" malicious practices \" of which he so feelingly complains. But Dr. Birch, in his \" Life of Prince Henry,\" thus tells the story \u2014"], [370, "234 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. The Earl of Northampton, who, with the wardenship of the Cinque Ports, held the post of Lord Privy Seal, conferred upon him in the end of April, 1608, had, by the instigation of some persons, who had no great regard either for the Earl of Not tingham, Lord High Admiral, or for some of the principal officers of the navy in special favour with his lordship, procured a large commission from the King for the enquiring into all abuses and misdemeanours committed in their several stations, under pretence of reformation, and of saving great sums to His Majesty, expended yearly in the maintenance of his ships. This enquiry was carried on by Sir Peter Bucke, Clerk of the Ships, Thomas Bucke, his brother, under-clerk to him ; Mr. Matthew Baker, and Mr. William Bright, principal shipwrights to the King ; Hugh Marriott, one of the six masters ; Hugh Lydiard, Clerk of the Cheque at Woolwich ; Thomas Norris, and one Clifton, a baker, formerly purser of ships in the navy, with divers others. The persons principally questioned and aimed at were, Sir Robert Mansell, then Treasurer of the Navy ; Sir John Trevor, surveyor ; Sir Henry Palmer, comptroller ; Captain Thomas Button ; John Legat, Clerk of the Cheque at Chatham ; Mr. Phineas Pette, and Sir Thomas Bluther, then Victualler of the Navy. This enquiry, which began in 1608, was prosecuted with such violence and malice as not only occasioned a great trouble and expense to the persons accused, but likewise brought almost ruin ..ii the navy, and a far greater yearly charge upon his Majesty than had ever been known before. The Lord Admiral, the Earl of Worcester, Master of the Horse, and the Earl of Suffolk, Lord Chamberlain, being appointed by the King to hear the cause of complaint against Mr. Pette, met at Woolwich on the 28th of April, 1609, and their report proved very favourable to him. But his Majesty resolving to hear the cause himself, w*ent to Woolwich on Monday, May the Sth, attended by the Prince. The Trial. \u2014 Let Mr. Pett resume : \u2014 All things being in readiness, about eight o'clock* His Majesty came in his coach, attended with Prince Henry and the principal lords of his Majesty's Council. The Lord Northampton met him before he came to the ordinary gate of the yard, and used all the means he could to have led his Majesty through Lydiard's garden by a back way into his house, but his Majesty told his lordship that the Lord Admiral, whom he espied waiting at the ordinary gatet of the yard, would justly take excep tions at his so doing, for that it belonged properly there to his lordship to receive and entertain him ; so, alighting, the Lord Admiral, after his duty performed, guided his Majesty in the room purposely provided for the business. After his Majesty had a little reposed, he desired the Lord Admiral to bring him to the sight of the work then in hand, which being done, directing his Majesty to a brow or stage made at the stern of the ship, where he might take a perfect view of the whole groundwork of the frame, being then about half set up and planked as high as the wrong heads, no foot wailing as yet begun. After his Majesty had satisfied himself sufficiently, he returned back to the place again and there seated himself, the Prince and lords taking their stands on his Majesty's right hand, with the Lord Admiral and all those warned on our part ; and the Lord Northampton on the left hand of his Majesty, with all his crew of informers and others appointed to assist him on his part, of sea-masters and shipwrights of the Thames. These things thus ordered, his Majesty (silence being commanded by his gentleman-usher) began a very worthy speech ; first, to signify the cause of his coming to that place, and how much it imported the royal care of a king to take to * Early rising has always been a royal virtue. t The old gate at Church Hill."], [371, "WOOLWICH. 235 his personal examination a business of such consequence as so much concerned the strength and honour of the kingdom and state, besides the expense of his treasure. Then he addressed his speech to the actors on both sides, to those who were informers and to those who were defendants, the substance of his royal speech tendin-' to religious exhortation, that none on both sides should either accuse for malice or other pretence, or excuse for love, favour, or other particular respects ; for that his Majesty, ity, in the seat of justice representing God's person, would not be deluded or led by any coloured pre tences from under standing the very plain truth oi that business which was to be handled, and therefore wished such on both sides, whose con science accused them either of ma licious proceedings, private ends, or par tial favour, to give over and depart before they took the oaths adminis tered to them, threatening severe punishment to those who should be found offenders therein, declaring what dan ger it was to be per jured before the majesty of God and the King. His Ma jesty's speech so effectually delivered to the purpose of the matter in hand, to the admiration of the hearers, com mandment was given to call the names of those to be sworn on both sides. James I. in Council. From the picture of \" The King and the French Ambassador.\" The names were then specified. The persons were in number \u2014 on the Lord7 Northampton's side, fourteen seamen, eight shipwrights, and two informers ; on the other side, fourteen seamen, and thirteen shipwrights. These several persons called and appearing, the form of the oath was read unto them by the Earl of Salisbury, Lord Treasurer, who personated the Clerk of the Ses sion, and the book was presented to them by the Right Honourable Charles Howard,"], [372, "236 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Earl of Nottingham, Lord High Admiral. This and these ceremonies performed, his Majesty willed the Lord Northampton to begin his accusation, and then I was called personally to answer, and kneeled right before his Majesty, the Lord Admiral stand ing on my right hand, Sir Robert Mansel and Sir John Trevor standing both right behind me. The accusation against me was exhibited by Lord Northampton in writing, containing sundry articles in point of my sufficiency, art, and experience, and in point of my care and honesty in discharge of my duty in unserviceable materials, to the great detriment of his Majesty's service. His Majesty perceiving the articles to be many and very intricate to answer each particular, very judiciously contracted the business to three principal heads \u2014 the point of art, the point of sufficiency of materials, and the point of charge ; and to these heads I was commanded to make my answers and they their accusations. I must confess that at the first I was so daunted at the majesty ofthe King, the power of my enemies, and the confused urging of the objections, that I was confounded in myself till it pleased God, by the help of the Lord Treasurer and his discreet directions, I was recollected and recovered my spirits, and so orderly answered to each objection, his Majesty still holding us on both sides to the proportions. Much time was spent in dispute of proportions, comparing my present frame with former precedents, and dimensions for the best ships for length, breadth, depth, floor, and other circumstances, in all which they could not fasten anything upon me, but reflected to their disgrace and apparent breach of oath and plain demonstration and expression of combined prac tice. One point of proportion was mainly insisted upon, and with much violence and eagerness urged on both sides, which was the square of the ship's flat in the midships, they offering constantly upon their oath that it was full thirteen feet, we as constantly insisting that it w*as eleven feet eight inches. But because this difference was long and could not be tried upon the small plats, his Majesty referred the trial to be made on the great platform which was purposely framed of planks to the full scale of the ship, where all the lines of the midship bend were drawn and the square of the flat only described, w*ith their centres, perpendiculars, and sweeps, which trial, because it much concerned the truth or falsity of all the rest, his Majesty would not give trust to any of those who by oath were interested in the same, but made choice of the noble and worthy knight, Sir Thomas Chaloner, the Governor of the Prince his ,Highness's household, and of the learned Rev. Mr. Briggs, reader of geometry, lecturer in Gresham CoUege in London, and Master of Arts, student in St. John's College, Cam bridge, who were to decide the controversy. This thus concluded, we came to the point of charge, to which w*as answered that the charge of building this ship should not exceed other ships that had been built in her Majesty's time (I mean Queen Elizabeth of famous and happy memory), allowing for proportion, the garnishing not exceeding theirs. This gave full satisfaction to the point of charge, being the second head propounded. It being then almost one o'clock, his Majesty called for his dinner, referring the other points to be handled in the ship after dinner. All this time I sat on my knees, baited by the great lord and his bandogs, sometimes by Baker, sometimes by Stevens, Bright, Clay, gaping Weymouth, and sometimes confused by aU, and, which was worse, his Majesty's countenance still bent upon me ; so that I was almost dis heartened and out of breath, albeit the Prince's Highness standing near me from time to time encouraged me as far as he might without offence to his father, labouring to have me eased by standing up, but his Majesty would not permit it. So soon as his Majesty and the Lords had dined, the King rose and went into the body of the frame of the ship to make trial of the goodness of the materials. All the lower futtocks were placed, and many other futtocks also. The adverse party had chalked almost half the lower futtocks for red-wood, cross-grained, and merely un serviceable, all which timber his Majesty caused to be dubbed by workmen ready"], [373, "WOOLWICH. 237 with their tools for that purpose ; and, being tried, they were all approved very sound and serviceable ; and, touching the cross-grained timber, his Majesty said very earnestly \u2014 \" The cross-grain is in the men and not in the timber.\" His Majesty spent much time in the survey of these things, still opening way to what objections the adverse party could allege and what answer I could make for my defence. This business performed within board, his Majesty well satisfied in every particular, he openly delivered that the ship would be too strong if one third part of the timber were left out, and then began to give a princely countenance and encour agement, protesting often-times that all this grievous accusation proceeded of nothing but malice. Then his Majesty came without board, and curiously surveyed the planks, the tree-nails, and workmanship, all which gave such satisfaction as stiU con firmed his opinion of their malicious proceedings. All the while his Majesty was intent upon this search, the gentlemen forenamed who were appointed for the trial of the point of the true flat of the floor, were busied in taking the measures from the ship and bringing them to the platform ; and when they found by due trial all lines to be truly set off', they acquainted his Majesty that aU these things were in readiness. His Majesty having then received satisfaction of all things about the frame, repaired to the platform, attended with the Prince, lords, and many thousand spectators besides. His Majesty caUed the gentlemen to measure each dimension of breadth and depth for his own satisfaction, and then, coming to the point of the square of tbe floor, whether it were answering their assertion of thirteen feet or agreeable to ours of eleven feet eight inches. The square of thirteen feet was tried from the true centre and perpendicular, which, being applied to the swaps of the mould, did differ about sixteen inches at the wrong head ; the like trial made by our true centre and perpendicular fell as just in our lines as could be'possible ; which done, his Majesty, with a loud voice, commandeth the measurers to declare publicly the very truth ; which, when they had delivered clearly on our side, aU the multitude heaved up their hats and gave a great and loud shout and acclamation. And then the Prince his Highness called with a high voice in these words : \u2014 \" Where be now these perjured feUows that dare thus abuse his Majesty with these false informations '! Do they not worthily deserve hanging 1 \" By that time aU these things were performed, and his Majesty wonderfully satis fied, and it growing something late, his Majesty returned into the haU again where he formerly sat, and being placed and the room being fiUed as full as it could be packed, his Majesty began a most worthy and learned speech for conclusion of the business, wherein he expressed with many effectual speeches, what content he received in bestowing his pains that day to so good a purpose. Next, his Majesty addressed himself to the Lord Northampton for his great care and diligence for searching out such errors in the office of the Admiralty, wherein his Majesty and State were abused, with encouragement for him to go forward with prosecuting his commission, notwithstanding his lordship had been misinformed by being drawn to question this business. He next directed his speech to Mr. Baker, Bright, Stevens, and all the rest of the informers, very bitterly reprehending their malicious practice, more to bring to effect their own private ends than out of any con ceivable care of the good of his Majesty's service or benefit of the State, repining at the preferment I had and the countenance of his son,' the Prince, combining together to disgrace and ruin me (though otherwise they envied one another, and were at contro versy who should be preferred to my business) ; with many good exhortations to will them to beware how they did abuse the majesty of God, and himself, his substitute, with malicious informations, in which he could do no less than think them perjured, as in the prosecuting of this whole business was too apparent to himself and all the Q"], [374, "238 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. world ; whereby they deserved to be punished severely, if he should censure them as they worthily merited. His Majesty then began to shew me a very pleasing countenance, and turned his speech to me, willing me not to be discountenanced with these proceedings against me, seeing he was now sufficiently persuaded of my honesty, integrity, and ability to perform what I had undertaken ; advising me not to refuse council of my fellow-ser vants, since it was his service, wherein we ought to join together for his good and the honour of the State, with many other princely expressions of his good opinion of me, and readiness not only to give me countenance but assurance of future favour toward me ; and, lastly, he cleared all imputations and aspersions unjustly cast upon the Lord Admiral, with recital of all his honourable service performed to the honour Water Procession of James I. (Even on common occasions the sovereign moved upon the Thames with regal pomp, surrownded by boats, and guards, and musicians.) of the State and his perpetual fame ; commending his great wisdom and impartial carriage of himself in this day's trial, wherein he was never observed to give impedi ment to his Majesty's proceedings, but all furtherance possible, as was both evidently manifest to his Majesty by the great pains he had endured that day, and the noble patience he had given public testimony of to all present who were eyewitnesses, with many other gracious speeches to put new life and power into him, to go on as he had begun, to the perpetual remitting his name and honour. Then giving general thanks to those who had taken pains in that day's business, with protestations of his princely care in all matters of such consequence for the safety and honour of the State and kingdom, he concluded his speech. Then the noble Admiral, as his Majesty was rising, humbly besought his Majesty to license him to speak a few words, as well to declare his own innocency concerning these unjust accusations, as to clear me in the point of my insufficiency and care and honesty to perform the service entrusted to me, to which his honour's request (though"], [375, "WOOLWICH. 239 it grew now to be late) his Majesty most willingly condescended. The sum of his lordship's speech tended to admire and extol his Majesty's justice, great wisdom, and princely care of the good of the commonwealth, in that he had refused no pains (as this day's work and honourable assembly could justly witness) to provide, to rectify, and to set straight, to the wonder and admiration of them all, a work of so great con sequence and of such a kind of intricacy as his Majesty had never been accustomed to before, and yet so clearly to examine and try in so short a space as if he had been only bred and accustomed to such elements, with many other speeches tending to that purpose. His lordship then, laying his hand upon my head, standing next to him upon his right hand, did there freely offer to pawn all his lands, his honour, and his life, in my behalf, for the performance and finishing of this royal work, which being once perfected, if his Majesty (by advice of the best artists and seamen of his kingdom) should dislike, he would willingly, with the aid of his friends, take off from his Maj esty 's hands, at his and their proper charge, without any damage to his Majesty. To this speech his Majesty replied briefly with a gracious acknow- ledgment of his princely acceptance of his lord ship's true and faithful service and zeal, ex pressed in that his worthy speech, of which he had so great assur ance, as he confidently protested, never King could be more happy than himself in the ser vice of such an honour able subject ; and, there fore, there was no need why he should any way engage either himself or Henry, Prince of Wales. his honour in that which his Majesty had by the course of upright justice before the face of God and the w*orld, so apparently cleared. This said, his Majesty arose. In passing through the hall, the Lord Admiral going before and leading me in his hand, the Lord Thomas Howard, then' Lord Chamberlain of the Household, made a motion to his Majesty to lay a charge upon me, that I should not make any quarrel against any person or persons that had that day given information against me, alleging, he knew mv stomach to be such as, if I were not contained by his Majesty's commandment, I would call them to account for their doings, whereupon blood might ensue. His Majesty gave ear to what his lordship advised, gave him thanks for his worthy counsel, and, calling me to him before the whole company, I sitting upon my knees he gave me an especial charge upon my allegiance and life, that I should not quarrel Q 2"], [376, "240 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. or chaUenge any person or persons whatsoever that had that day given information against me, aUeging I had honour sufficient to have been cleared of all questions and objections unjustly charged against me by the equity of my cause and his justice. This speech concluded, his Majesty hasted to take his coach, which attended at the gate. His Majesty gave me his hand to kiss, with such an expression of princely favour and encouragement to proceed cheerfully in my business, as did not only infuse new life into me, but also gave great comfort and content to all standers-by. Then I presented myself on my knee to the most noble prince, my then master, who, taking me from the ground, did so affectionately express his joy for my clearing, and the satisfaction that his father had received that day, that he protested he would not only countenance and comfort me hereafter, but take great care to provide for me and my posterity whilst he lived. I received the like courtesy from aU the lords, who declared their joy for the happy success God gave me in this great deliverance. The great Lord Northampton, seeing the event of this business, and that aU things sorted out clear contrary to his expectations, railing.bitterly against his informing instruments, took the way back to his coach, and would not so much as take leave of his Majesty, but passed away with no little expression of great discontent, as did also the rest of their partakers. The Lord Admiral attended his Majesty, being never better content in all his Use, and returned to WhitehaU with the company, it being almost eight o'clock before they went from Woolwich. This day it was very tedious to me by reason I was to answer all objections, and kneel so long together ; so was it a day of jubilee to me, a day never to be forgotten by me nor mine, wherein my good God shewed me wonderful favour and mercy to enable me to endure the frowns of the King, and to strengthen my weak abilities to withstand the malice of such and so many powerful adversaries by the space of one whole summer's day. After the Verdict. \u2014 The remarkable event here related will pro bably not escape tbe observation of future English historians. It illustrates not only an important epoch in our naval progress, but brings into relief the character of the all-sufficient monarch who founded the Stuart line and united the kingdoms of Great Britain. The trial of Phineas Pett might well form the subject of an historical picture. Failing such representation, I am fain to borrow the figure of tbe King in bis state chair at page 235 from the picture of \" James I. and the French Ambassador.\" The cushion at the sovereign's footstool is painfully suggestive of poor Pett kneeling for the greater part of a long summer's day, in physical torture and mental tension, which he so acutely depicts. But his triumph was complete, and he goes on to tell us that \u2014 The next day, being the 9th of May, I began to work again, every man striving to express his willingness thereunto, by reason of the great encouragement his Majesty had publicly and generously given them ; and, within two or three days after, the Lord Admiral, Sir Robert ManseB, Sir John Trevor, advising together with me, we resolved to move the Lords of the Council to have two principal men who were ship wrights, to be by their order appointed to repair twice at least in the week to Wool wich, to survey the provisions, and to foresee that no unserviceable materials should be wrought upon the ship, which we did to clear all suspicions of any ends of our own. This accordingly was consented to of the Lords, and Mr. Matthew Baker and Henry Reynolds were appointed to be overseers, who, for fashion's sake, some three"], [377, "WOOLWICH. 241 or four times came to Woolwich, but, finding our care to be more to perform honestly than theirs could be to prevent with their best endeavours, they gave over the trust recommended to them, and left me to myself. Pett's enemies, however, had not quite done with him, for a little later he says \u2014 Thursday in Whitsun week, his Majesty began to hear the great and general cause of the navy in his Presence Chamber at Greenwich, wherein three whole days were spent in several examinations of the truth and circumstances of the informations delivered by the Lord Northampton and his agents against Sir Robert Mansell, Sir John Trevor, and Captain Button, Sir Thomas Bluther, Mr. Leggatt, and many others, together with myself. First day, the Lord Northampton made me the .very entrance into the business, a great complaint of the dishonour he reaped by the hearing at Woolwich, insisting very maliciously in incensing his Majesty against me and others who, as he said, traduced him in every tavern and ale-bench, to his great dishonour and therefore humbly besought his Majesty that business might be again called in question, aUeging the confidence of the informers, who were ready to maintain the truth of their former information with their lives. His Majesty, taking it ill that my lord should dare to question his first proceedings, which he had taken such pains personally to hear determined, took him short with a sharp reprehension, and willed him no further to insist upon that whereof his Majesty and the whole world were ao sufficiently satisfied."], [378, "Charles I. CHAPTER XXI UNDER THE STUARTS. Prince Henry's Affection for Woolwich. \u2014 On the 13th of\" August, 1608, Prince Henry's growing affection for the navy led him to make a visit to the royal dock at Woolwich. We read that \u2014 The Prince took his harge at Blackwall and came to Woolwich about noon, accompanied only with his own train. He was received by Mr. Pett on shore at the yard stairs. On the poop of the Royal Anne were placed trumpets and an ensign, and on the heads of both of the mizens, two ensigns. Mr. Pett having paid his compliments to the Prince, and represented how great a satisfaction it would be to all the seamen to perceive his Highness so well affected to the navy, he conducted the Prince round about the dock, and so directly aboard the Royal Anne, to the very top of her poop, where he gave a signal to Mr. William Bull, the Master-Gunner of England, who stood ready prepared upon a mount* with thirty-one great brass cham bers, orderly and distinctly placed, which had been procured from the Tower for that purpose by Mr. Pett with the assistance of the Master-Gunner, who, upon the signal made, gave fire to the train, and discharged the whole volley with such good order as was highly satisfactory to the Prince, and the more so because it was unexpected. When the ordnance ceased firing, Mr. Pett kneeled to his Highness, and requested him to accept this poor sea-entertainment as an unfeigned earnest of duty to him. * Probably Bowater Hill."], [379, "PLATE XXVI.

Having examined these with great attention, his Highness caused the length of the keel to be measured, and being then desired to walk into the house to rest himself, he readily consented, and found in the parlour a set banquet of sweetmeats and all other fruits which the season yielded, with plenty of wine\u2014 Rhenish, white sack, Greek, and claret. After he had refreshed himself, and given his hand to kiss to divers gentlewomen of the town, who were in the room with Mr. Pett's wife, he desired to be conducted to the mount where the chambers were placed, which were again charged and ranged in their former order with the train made ready. This sight delighted him so much, that he was desirous to have the train fired while he stood by ; but at Mr. Pett's entreaty and representation of the danger, he ordered that at the holding up of his handkerchief in his barge they should be discharged, which was accordingly done, after his Highness had expressed his satisfaction in the whole entertainment. Again, says Mr. Pett \u2014 The last days of January, 1610, the Prince's Highness came to Woolwich to see what forwardness the ship was in, where I gave him and his followers entertainment. Also on the lst of February, the ringers at St. Margaret's * were paid 2s. 6d. for ringing for the king. We may continue for a while longer Mr. Pett's interesting narra tive : \u2014 On the 18th of June, 1610, the Prince's Highness came to Woolwich to see the ship, which was now in great forwardness, and almost ready, and the next day he came thither again, in company with the King his father, and a great train attending on them. In the afternoon his Majesty spent almost two hours in great content, in surveying the ship, both within and without, protesting it did not repent him to have taken such great pains in examination of the business of the work, since the fruit thereof yielded him such content. His Majesty then did me the honour to come into the house, where my wife had prepared a banquet of sweetmeats and such fruits as were then to be had, whereof he was pleased to taste plentifully, and did very graciously accept of his homely entertainment, giving me special command not to launch the ship till his progress was ended. t Between Easter and Michaelmas that the ship began to be garnished, it is incredible what numbers of people continually resorted to Woolwich, of all sorts, both nobles, gentry, and citizens, and from all parts of the country round about, which was no small charge to me in giving daily entertainment to all comers, which could not possibly be avoided in that place at such a time. The 9th of September, being Sunday, about six o'clock in the morning, divers London maids, coming to see the ship, brought in their company a little boy of twelve yeare old, the only child of his mother, a widow woman dweUing in Tower Street, who carelessly going up and * The parish church of \" St. Mary \" must be meant here. t This ship had been nearly two years in building, having been begun October 20th, 1608. A contemporary description of her says: \"The keele of this most goodly shippe for warre is 114 feet long, and the cross-beam 44 feet in length. She will carry threescore and foure pieces of great ordinance, and is of the burthen of 1,400 tons.\""], [382, "244 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. down upon the main orlop, fell down into the hold of the ship, and was thereby so bruised and broken that he died before midnight, being the first mischance that had happened in the whole time of the ship's building. About the middle of this month, being ready to have the ship strucken down upon her ways, I caused twelve of the choice master carpenters of his Majesty's navy to be sent for from Chatham to be assisting in her striking and launching ; and, upon the 18th day, being Tuesday, she was safely set upon her ways, and this day Sir Robert Mansell dined at my lodgings. The 20th of this month the French Ambassador came to Woolwich to see the ship, whom I entertained in the best manner I could, and in the time of his being with me, the Prince, my royal master, sent me a wonderful fat buck, which he killed with his own hand.* Now began we on all sides for the preparation to launch the ship, and for that purpose there was provided a rich standard of taffety very fairly gilded with gold, with his Majesty's arms, to be placed on the poop, and a very large ensign of crimson rich taffety, with a canton of the Prince's crest, to be placed upon the quarter-deck ; and all other ornaments were carefully provided befitting that purpose. There was a standing set up in the most convenient place of the yard for his Majesty, the Queen, and the royal children, and places fitted for the ladies and council all railed in and boarded. All the rooms, both in my own lodgings and at Mr. Lydiard's, were prepared, and very handsomely hanged and furnished with a cloth of state, chairs, stools, and other necessaries. Nothing was omitted that could be imagined any ways necessary both for ease and entertainment. Upon Sunday in the afternoon, being the 23rd, Sir Robert Mansell, Sir John Trevor, and Sir Henry Palmer, came to Woolwich to see how everything was ordered ; and, finding all things prepared and fitted to their liking, about three o'clock they returned all to Deptford, where they lodged that night with Sir Robert Mansell. This evening very late, there came a messenger to me from Court at Theobalds, to give me orders to be very careful to search the ship's hold for feare some persons disaffected might have bored some holes privily in the ship to sink her after she should be launched ; but my care had prevented their fears beforehand so far as could be searched or discovered. On Monday morning, assisted by the help of my brother Simonson, and sundry others of my friends, we opened the dock-gates, and made all things ready against the tide, but the wind blowing very hard at south-west kept out the flood, so that it proved a very bad tide, little better than a neap, which put us afterwards to great trouble and hazard. The King's Majesty came from Theobalds, though he had been very ill with surfeiting from eating grapes, and landed here about eleven o'clock. Prince Henry attended him, and most of the Lords of the Council. The Lord Admiral, attended by the principal officers of the navy, together with myself, received him on land out of his barge, and conducted him to the place provided for him in Mr. Lydiard's house. His dinner was dressed in our great kitchen. After dinner came the Queen's Majesty, accompanied with the Duke of York, Lady Elizabeth, and divers great lords and ladies in her train, the drums and trumpets placed on the poop and forecastle, and the wind instruments by them, so that nothing was wanting to so great a royalty that could be desired. When it grew towards high water, and aU things ready, and a great close lighter made fast to the ship's stern, and the Queen's Majesty with her train placed, the Lord Admiral gave me commandment to heave taut the crabs and screws, though I had little hope to * On August 31st of this year (1610), Mr. Pett wrote to the Prince at Nonesuch, where he was hunting, reminding his Royal Highness that \" he had of his nobleness promised to send me a buck to Woolwich, because he had then given aU away that were faUen that day.\""], [383, "WOOLWICH. 245 launch, by reason the wind over-blew the tide, yet the ship started; and had launched but the dock-gates pent her in so straight that she stuck fast between them, by reason the ship was nothing lifted by the tide, as we expected she would ; and the great lighter, by unadvised counsel, being cut off the stern, the ship settled so hard upon the ground that there was no possibility of launching that tide ; besides which, there was a multitude of people got into the ship, that one could scarce stir by another. The noble Prince himself, accompanied with the Lord Admiral and other great Lords, were on the poop, where the great standing gilt cup was ready filled with wine, to name the ship so soon as she had been afloat, according to ancient custom and ceremony performed at such times, by drinking part of the wine, giving the ship her name, and heaving the standing cup overboard. The King's Majesty was much grieved at the frustrate of his expectation, coming on purpose, though very iU at ease, to have done me honour. But God saw it not so good for me, and therefore sent this cross upon me, both to humble me and to make me know that however we proposed He would dispose all things as He pleased ; so that about five o'clock his Majesty with the Queen and all her train departed away to Greenwich, where the household were removed. Prince Henry stayed a good while after his Majesty was gone, conferring with the Lord Admiral, principal officers, and myself, what was to be done, and, leaving the Lord Admiral to stay here to see that aU things were performed that were resolved on, he took horse, and rode after them to Greenwich with promise to return presently after midnight. So soon as the multitude were gone and all things quiet, we went presently in hand to make way with the sides of the gates ; and having great store of scavel-men and other labourers, we had made aU things ready before any flood came, which per- formed, every man applied himself to get victuals} and to take rest. The Lord Admiral sat up aU night in a chair in his chamber till the tide was come about the ship, and Sir Robert Mansell, Sir John Trevor, and Sir Henry Palmer, and the rest, made a shift in my lodging to rest themselves. The beginning of the night was very fair, and bright moonshine, the moon being a little past fuU ; but after midnight the weather was sore overcast, and a very sore gust of rain, thunder, and lightning, which made me doubt that there were some indirect working among our enemies to dash our launching. * These gusts lasted about half an hour with great extremity, the wind being at south-west. In the midst of this great gust Prince Henry and aU his train were taken upon the top of Blaekheath in their coming to Woolwich ; but his invincible spirit, daunted with nothing, made little account of it, but came through, and was no sooner alighted in the yard, but calling for the Lord Admiral and myself, and Sir Robert Mansell, went all presently on board the ship, being about two o'clock, almost an hour before high water, and was no sooner entered but the word being given to set all taut, the ship went away without any straining of screws or tackles till she came clear afloat in the middle of the channel, to the great joy and comfort of the Prince's Highness, the Lord Admiral, and all the rest of my noble friends ; which mercy of God to me I pray I may never forget. His Highness then standing upon the poop, with a selected company only, besides the trumpeters, with a great deal of expression of princely joy, and with the ceremony of drinking in the standing cup, threw all the wine forwards towards the half deck, and solemnly caUing her by the name of the Prince Royal, the trumpets sounding all the while, with many gracious words to me, gave the standing cup into my own hands, and would not go from the ship till he saw her fast at her moorings. In heaving down to her moorings, we found that all the hawsers that were laid ashore for landfasts were treacherously cut, to put the ship to hazards of running ashore, if God had not blessed us better. In * Mr. Pett was not free from the then prevalent superstition of witchcraft."], [384, "246 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. the interim of warping to her moorings, his Highness went down to the platform of the cock-room, where the ship's beer stood for the ordinary company, and there finding an old can without a lid, went and drew it full of beer himself, and drank it off to'the Admiral, and caused him with the rest of his attendants to do the like. At nine the same morning, being very rainy, he took his barge, accompanied with tbe Lord Admiral and the rest of his train, and giving us a princely gracious farewell, rode against the tide to Greenwich, where he made relation of all the business and the circumstances thereof to the King his father. We then came ashore to refresh our selves with victuals, and to take some rest, having toiled all the night before ; and amongst the rest Sir Henry Palmer was pleased to stay dinner, where we drank Prince Henry's health round, to handsel the standing cup given at the launching. The Queen Mother. \u2014 Queen Anne of Denmark was another believer in Pett. In Strickland's \" Lives \" we are told that tbe Queen was persuaded by her son, Henry, Prince of Wales, to attend at Wool wich the launch of a ship which had been built by the Prince's favourite architect, Phineas Pett. \" Young as Henry was,\" says Mrs. Strickland, \" he had already supported this valuable servant of tbe country against the insolence and oppression of tbe arbitrary junto of which tbe King's favourite, Somerset, was tbe tool. The Queen threw all her influ ence in the support of her virtuous and right-judging son, not because be was virtuous and just, but because her strong maternal instinct and her queenly pride were alike centred in her firstborn, the darling of her heart and the delight of her eyes.\" Anne of Denmark. Prince Henry's Fate.\u2014 Prince Henry's sudden and suspicious death, which occurred in November, 1612, in bis eighteenth year, to the great grief of the nation and tbe special sorrow of Woolwich, deprived Pett of a powerful auxiliary and excellent friend. But the King, who was lampooned as the \"most learned fool in Europe,\" and bas even been suspected of connivance at bis son's assassination, was true to his son's companion, Pett. He con tinued also to take an interest in Woolwich, and, so long as he had bealth and vigour, his Majesty was a staunch supporter of the Royal Navy. The King of Denmark. \u2014 Although the diary of Mr. Pett has"], [385, "WOOLWICH. 247 taken up so much space, a few further extracts are indispensable. He says \u2014 On the 22nd of June, 1613, the King of Denmark came suddenly to Somerset House unexpected. The lst of August, my gracious master King James, with the King of Denmark, Prince of Wales, and many other lords, came to Woolwich, and went on board the Mer Honeur, then lying in the dry dock and almost finished, which ship liked them wondrous well. Decline of James. \u2014 James ruled for twelve years longer, but his zeal for the navy, so long sustained, did not increase with bis infirmities, and there are signs of some falling off in our dockyard towards the end. It is, indeed, to be assumed that its enemies and rivals began to make way as tbe vigilance of the monarch declined, and , in tbe last year of his life, Chatham bad obtained such an ascendancy that there was a vast increase of employment there in consequence of tbe removal of works from Woolwich and Deptford. The King's Death. \u2014 Tbe dockyard fell undoubtedly into a state of neglect when King James died. AVe perceive that in the second year of Charles I. (1627), Captain John Mason writes from Wool wich to say that all things are ruined there, for tbe particular ends of someone, and will cost much labour to rectify. If his Majesty (Charles I.) be pleased to keep tbe use of this dock, it will, he adds, be necessary to appoint someone to take care thereof, and Captain John Mason modestly proposes himself. Under Charles I. \u2014 The shipwrights were in a state of discontent approaching insubordination. One of their number, named Edward Stevens, was, in 1626, committed to prison for disrespectful words spoken to Sir Sackville Trevor and Captain Pett, on the survey of tbe Triumph at Woolwich ; and although Charles I. seems to have paid a visit to the place shortly afterwards, matters still went on badly. The slackness of work is shown in a petition sent to the King from the ship-carpenters at Woolwich, soliciting employment in the navy, for \"as the King's works expire they are all discharged in tbe dead of winter,\" and it is clear that for some years the yard bad been almost ignored. One entry seems to imply that the whole establishment had been condemned by Charles I. or his father, both of whom were supposed to have been jealous of Prince Henry's popularity, and not too much pleased with his partiality for Woolwich. Regarded from the present distance of time the assumption seems unjust, and it is more probable that the influence of the King's opponents in Parliament was at the root of the mischief. Supplies were granted with a niggard hand, wholesale retrenchments were demanded, and the services were worried with perpetual inquisitions and changes. The effect upon Woolwich is shown in a letter from the officers of the navy dated 1628,"], [386, "248 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. recommending the reappointment of John May as assistant to the Master Shipwright at Woolwich Dock, from which he was said to have been \" discharged by the late Commissioners at a time when the dock was cast as of no use at that time.\" The troubles of tbe King and his Parliament were beginning, and the whole town was in one of its periodical depressions for several years. Tbe distress among its water men was such that, for want of employment on the river, they were driven elsewhere, perhaps to that common refuge, the sea ; and on Febru ary 2nd, 1629, when there was a muster of all the watermen belonging to the port of London and the liberties thereof, Gravesend sent 121 and Greenwich 128 ; while Deptford could find but 20, and Woolwich and Erith together contributed only 19. A Visit from King Charles. \u2014 Through all the tribulation, however, Phineas Pett had won the favour of Charles as be had previously gained the good graces of his royal brother and father, and although the new king had an impoverished exchequer, be found some work for Pett's shipwrights, and paid frequent visits to Woolwich Dockyard. In his diary of 1631, Mr. Pett says: \u2014 The 21st of April, his Majesty (Charles I.), with divers of the lords, viz. Treasurer, Chamberlain, Marquis of Hamilton, Holland, and others, came to Woolwich to see the Vanguard launched, which was performed to his Majesty's great content. I entertained them in my lodgings with cakes, wine, and other things, that were weU accepted. His Majesty commanded me into his barge with him, designing to see the St. Dennis at Deptford, in the dry dock, but, the rain preventing him, I was put into 3 pair of oars. On Friday morning the Victory, lying above the Vanguard, was launched out of the same dock.* In the beginning of the year 1632, I was com manded to assist my son Peter in building a new ship of eight hundred tons at Woolwich, which was begun in February, most part of her frame being made in the forest of Shotover, and Stowkw-ood, Oxfordshire. My son had the oversight of the work. About the 8th of June, his Majesty came to Woolwich to see the work. I entertained him in my lodgings. Again, in 1633\u2014 The 30th of January, the new ship at Woolwich was launched, his Majesty being present, and stood in my lodgings. The ship's name was Charles, after his own name. The next day Mr. Goddard's ship was launched ; the King and Queen were present, and was called after the Queen's name, the Henrietta Maria. The Chronic Fluctuation. \u2014 Another ship, called the Unicorn, was also launched here on February 6th, 1633, \" though they had no more water than the ship drew,\" and a few fitful orders kept the works going. But matters nevertheless did not improve, and great misery prevailed continually until 1634, in the March of which year Secretary Windebank reported that he had, according to his Majesty's command- * It was a \" double dock,\" being twice the usual length."], [387, "249 WOOLWICH. ment, advised with Sir Robert Mansell concerning the petition of the carpenters intended to have been presented to his Majesty at Woolwich, and found their complaint in some circumstances just, and \" a necessity for keeping them in work.\" He had ascertained that they were sus pended by the officers of the navy, on the Lords of the Admiralty respit ing the allowance of the estimate for reparation of the hulls of the King's ships, which are in some decay, and be therefore begged the King to order Secretary Coke to have them repaired, \" they being now unserviceable, and continual reports of great preparations upon the coast of France. The King's honour and safety,\" he adds, \" consists in his navy, and money must be found for reparation of those bulls, whatsoever else be slowed.\" A National Crisis. \u2014 Affairs were really becoming critical, for the King bad dissolved his Parliament and was endeavouring, in the teeth of the Constitution and the protests of the nation, to rule without an elected assembly. Foes were threatening from within and from without, and at last Charles seems to have decided that he must increase the power of his fleet. Accordingly in 1634 he levied that \" ship money\" tax which so much deepened bis people's dissatisfaction with This reign, and hastened tbe coming climax. It is said to have been an impost as righteous as most taxes are, and it at least brought advantage to Woolwich in an order to build tbe finest ship of war that had ever been seen. The \"Royal Sovereign.\" \u2014 The great vessel was called the Royal Sovereign, and she was launched in 1637. Several descriptions of her are extant, and she is fairly delineated in the illustration on Plate XXIV. One writer says, that \" the piece of timber which made the kelson was so great and weighty that twenty- eight oxen and four horses had much difficulty in dragging it to the waterside.\" The ship was 1637 tons burden, corresponding with the date of the year \u2014 a coincidence which was said to have been undesigned. She had \" three decks and five lanthornes at her mastsheads, the biggest of which would hold ten persons standing upright without shouldering.'\" This writer, whose description was published the same year, concludes by an encouragement to all faithful and loving subjects to be \"liberal contributories towards the ship-money.\" Stow's \" Survey \" has the following details : \u2014 In Woolwich Dock hath been built the beat ships of war ; amongst which the Royal Sovereign, anno 1637 ; being in length by the keel 127 foot ; in breadth by the beam 47 foot ; and in depth 49 foot ; her draught of water 21 foot ; her burden in all 2,072 tuns, and 1,492 tuns, besides guns, tackle, &c. She hath six anchors, whereof the biggest weighs 6,000 lib., and the least 4,300 lib. She hath fourteen cables, whereof the"], [388, "250 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. greatest is 666 inches in diameter,* and 21 inches in compass, and weighs 9,000 lib.; her least cable being 254 inches diameter and 8 inches in circumference, and weighs near 1,300 lib. Unto her belonged eighteen masts and yards, whereof the mainmast is 113 foot lone and 33 inches diameter ; her main yard 105 foot long and 23 inches diameter. She carried several sorts of sails, of which her greatest is her main course, together with her bonnet, which contains 1,640 yards of canvas. One complete set or suit of sails belonging to her will cost \u00a3404 sterling. She carries a long boat of 50 foot, a pinnace of 36 foot, and a skiff of 27 foot long. The weight of her rigging is 33 tuns. She carries three tiers of guns, all of brass ; whereof there are 44 in her upper tier, 34 in her second, and 22 in her lower tier \u2014 in all 100 guns. Her complement of mariners, soldiers, and officers is 850 men. Her whole charge for wages, diet, ammunition, with wear and tear, for every month that she is at sea, costs the King \u00a33,500, as hath been computed by experienced accomptants. This royal ship was curiously carved and gilt with gold, so that w*hen she was in the engagement against the Dutch, they gave her the name of The Golden Devil, her guns being whole cannon, making such havoc and slaughter among them. The following is Phineas Pett's account of the building and launching \u2022of the ship : \u2014 The 3rd of February, 1637, his Majesty, the Prince Elector, and divers lords, came to Woolwich by water, and after viewing the work without board, they did the same within board, both aloft and in the hold, being well satisfied. Then retiring to my lodgings, they staid till the flood, and then returned in his Majesty's barge to White hall. Tuesday, the 29th of August, proved very rainy, yet the shipwrights of the river, who were called to help to strike the ship on her ways, being come, we struck her by eleven o'clock. The 25th of September was the day peremptorily appointed by his Majesty to launch the ship, so everything was prepared to be in readiness. His Majesty, accompanied by the Queen, and all the lords and ladies and their attendants, landed at Woolwich dock stairs about twelve o'clock, and went directly on board the. ship, where, staying about an hour, they retired into our room furnished for their \u25a0entertainment. About two o'clock the tackles were heaved taut, and the ship started till the tackles failed ami the water pinched, being a very bad tide. Then we shored the ship, and their Majesties returned to Whitehall, very sorry she could not be launched. After attempting two or three tides, we concluded to stay till the next spring, which was about the 12th of October ; in the interim many reports were raised to disable the ship and disgrace me. Sir Robert Mansell called a meeting at Woolwich of such Trinity masters as were. employed in the business, with all the officers of the navy, to resolve on the time of launching, which was generally concluded to be the Sunday following, being October 14th, and that I should not attempt to stir her before. But the Saturday night, the wind chopping fair westerly, promising a great tide, I caused the two masters of the navy to be ready, commanding all the hands we could on sudden to attend us, \u2022\u2022ontrary to the mind of Mr. Cooke who was unwilling to meddle with the ship in the night. But Mr. Ausiem, being the most resolute man, was for taking the first opportunity. The tide came on so fast that the ship was afloat by three-quarters flood, so I ordered to heave her out, which done, and the ship brought into the i-hannel by several warps, she was got to her moorings, lights being made all along the shore with reeds till the moorings w*ere made fast to the bits, which done, I sent * Stow*'s \" diameter \" here probably stands for length. In that case the ship's cables would have been respectively 55 and 21 feet long, but it is difficult to reconcile the weights."], [389, "WOOLWICH. 251 a messenger to Sir Robert Mansell at Greenwich, who came aboard with all speed and, according to His Majesty's order, called her the Sovereign of the Seas* The next morning the Trinity masters and others came to give their attendance, but finding the ship at her moorings they were much discontented, which they expressed as much as they could. This morning Sir Robert Mansell rode post to his Majesty, then at Hampton Court, and acquainted him with our proceedings, with which he was well pleased. The week following we reared our sheers to set our masts, which w*as all done in fourteen days, and as soon as the rigging was fixed and the sails at the yards, we removed from Woolwich to Erith for depth of water. His Majesty had been on board before she removed thence. The 6th of June following (1638), his Majesty with the Queen, the Duchess of Sheverees, Duke and Duchess of Lenox, and divers other lords and ladies, came on board the ship at Greenhithe, where they dined. At their going away we gave them seventeen guns. About the 12th of June the Sovereign weighed from Greenhithe, and anchored below Gravesend, where she rode till his Majesty came on board, which was July 21st. I had placed my then wife, Byland, daughter Fenn, and many other gentlewomen, my special friends, in the great cabin, to kiss his Majesty's hand ; and prevailing with his Majesty to go aft into the cabin, he most graciously gave each his hand to kiss. Then he took barge, and we saluted him with seventy two guns. State Rewards. \u2014 Mr Phineas Pett, with whom we have thus made extensive acquaintance, appears, even beyond his own showing, to have been a good and faithful servant of tbe nation. His yearly salary, in 1628, was but \u00a354 2s., a mean allowance even in that day, seeing that the master shipwright of the East India Company was at the same time paid \u00b1'250. But Mr. Pett bad a comfortable residence in the dockyard, and doubtless some privileges. Indeed, it appears that among other marks of the royal favour bestowed on our master shipwright, he enjoyed the disposal of two baronets' patents, one of which he sold for \u00a3700. Mr. Pett was also employed to fit out the fleet which carried over the Princess Elizabeth after her marriage to the Palsgrave in 1613, and accompanied the Lord Admiral in that voyage. In 1623, he went with Prince Charles to Spain, and for his attendance on this voyage he was presented with a gold chain valued at \u00a3104. In 1625, he fitted out the fleet which brought over Henrietta Maria, and attended the voyage. Death of Phineas Pett. \u2014 Mr. Pett was the first master of the Shipwrights' Company after their new charter of incorporation in 1612. * The ship was commonly known by her original name, the Royal Sovereign. Evelyn says that on 19th July, 1641, he \"rode to Rochester and Chatham to see the Soveraigne, a monstrous vessel, being for burthen, defence, and ornament, the richest that ever spread cloth before the wind, and especially for this remarkable, that her building cost his Majestie the affections of his subjects, who quarelled with him for a trifle, refusing to contribute either to their own safety or his glory.\" The ship met the same fate as had befallen the Great Harry, being accidentally burnt at Chatham, January 27th, 1696."], [390, "252 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. He is supposed to have died at Chatham in 1647, for the following entry appears in the register of that parish : \u2014 Phineas Pette, Esquire and Captain, buried August 21st, 1647. More of the Family. \u2014 Phineas had a son, also named Phineas, born in 1618, but this son seems to have died young. His third son, Peter, was shipbuilder at Woolwich in 1633, first assisting and then succeeding his father. He invented the description of ship known as \" tbe frigate.\" Peter Pett died in 1652,* leaving no family, and was succeeded in charge of this dockyard by his brother Christopher. Captain John Pett was Peter's eldest brother, and had a son whom he named Phineas, which Phineas also in course of time left Phineas the fourth and another Christopher. Of this pair the former was Com missioner of the Navy at Chatham, and the latter was distinguished in his generation at Woolwich. Tbe Petts were a clever and a famous race, but they were not always popular. The following lines by Marvell, written at a time of national chagrin during the Dutch war, refer to a prevalent disposition which existed to throw tbe blame on the shipbuilders : \u2014 All our misfortunes on Pett must fall, His name alone stands fit to answer all : Pett, the sea-architect, in making ships, Was the first cause of all our slips. Remnants of the Race. \u2014 I regret that I have not succeeded in find ing any portraits of the old Petts, and the nearest ap proach I can offer is the presentment of their de scendant, the Rev. Phineas Pett, archdeacon, who died Rev. Phineas Pett, at Oxford in 1830. There are many families named Pett at Deptford, but I am unable to trace any of them to the source from which in every probability they all came. The Dockyard in 1633. \u2014 During the time Peter Pett was An alabaster monument to the memory of Peter Pett may be seen in St. Nicholas Church, Deptford. He died January 31st, 1652, in his sixtieth year."], [391, "WOOLWICH. 253 employed under his father at Woolwich in 1633, he was engaged in assisting to make a very curious and exact survey of the Dockyard, by order of Charles I. The following is tbe description given : \u2014 By this plotte [plan wanting] is described the situation of the timber yards, the drie dock, and galley dock, the master builder and clerk of the cheque's house, and the storehouse between them ; the plancke yard and storehouse betweene it and the clif, the smith's forge, saw-houses, cranes on the wharf, &c. This yard is enclosed with an high clif to the southwards, the said houses westward, and the outermoste parte nexte the towne eastwarde, empaled from the clif to the waterside. A pale of nyne foot high and a pallisado upon it were very requisite to be made all alongest the wharfe towards the river, for the better preservation of the outstores from enibeseling. The wharfe without the yarde is much ruyned, and must of necessitie be repaired afore that pightle (a small enclosure) of ground without the yard enclosed with a gate from the highwaie ; otherwise in shorte tyme the river will eate it out so as no provicions maie be carried by land into or out of the dockyard. Mr. Doctor Gilbourne challengeth a small piece of ground, part of the pightle without the yard, to be his land. Ancient Limits. \u2014 This report presents to us a valuable picture of the early dockyard, with its boundary cliff next the high road, and it confirms the belief that tbe whole yard was originally confined to tbe low ground at the eastern end, near Church Hill. \" The wharf without the yard \" mentioned in the survey was probably more easterly still. The Privilege of \" Chips.\" \u2014 There have always been complaints of pilfering from tbe dockyard, and the paling and pallisading, even when complete, offered but a poor protection. And there was pecula tion from within as well as purloining from without, and the system of perquisites, beginning in high quarters, extended down to the humblest of the King's servants. It is about this period that we first hear of the great \" chip \" question. The shipwrights claimed and were allowed to carry away for firewood all the chips they made in their work, and they do not appear to have been very particular in their selection. Such privileges were almost unchecked during this weak and unhappy reign ; but once, when times were hard and chips were short, a daring shipwright loaded a barge with trenails \u2014 small wooden wedges or spikes \u2014 and his cargo was seized by an officer close to the King's yard. This was too much even for a dockyard, and, although the culprit pleaded his right, the officer in charge felt bound to report the circum stance to the higher authorities, but found it needful to offer as his excuse that \" the infinite abuse and prejudice the King has, in most of his yards, under colour of chips, is intolerable. If,\" be adds, \"every carpenter can claim such nails (trenails), the King's purse will deeply waste for it.\" He did not, however, succeed in abolishing the pernicious system. K"], [392, "Oliver Cromwell. CHAPTER XXII THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE RESTORATION The Protectorate. \u2014 Always active when the nation is stirred, Woolwich suffered no relapse during the remaining years of Charles's unfortunate monarch)*, mainly occupied as they were with the startling events of the civil war. Indeed, we must pass beyond the date of his execution in 1649, to find anything more of note in connection with the dockyard. But as soon as Oliver Cromwell settled down to work he proceeded to overhaul the navy and improve his artillery, both of which efforts necessarily turned his attention hitherward. In 1651 the Admiralty granted timber to make three butts at Woolwich for the trial of ordnance, and there is a note in tbe State records under date of November 22nd, 1652, which says : \" at Woolwich there is much work.\" It may be observed as an instance of the fidelity to their office ever manifested by the Pett family, that Christopher Pett, who was master shipwright here under Charles I., remained at his post under tbe Commonwealth. He was paid 20d. per day, but the Protector was generally a year in arrear with his wages. The First Dry Dock.\u2014 This Pett built a great ship called The President, which was launched in 1655, and he appears to have had a"], [393, "255 WOOLWICH. busy time. The Admiralty, to give him more space, hired a room by the waterside, sixty feet by twenty feet, of Captain Hosier, in July, 1653, for the storage of tar ; and in the same year the construction of a dry dock was ordered, at a cost of \u00a3561, with sheds of strong timber in addition. In this year also we find that a master-attendant was appointed, with \u00a3100 a year and a residence. Gunpowder on the Thames.\u2014 The order prohibiting ships containing gunpowder to pass above Woolwich, was made in 1654 by the Council of the State. War with the Dutch. \u2014 Cromwell's period, however, was not, as every reader knows, absorbed by domestic legislation. The Protector bad work both for his ships and his soldiers, and we learn that Woolwich had not only to find vessels for the navy, but crews to man them. We were at war with Holland, and the bold Dutchmen were harass ing our merchantmen and threatening our ports. But, on June tbe 2nd, 1653, the English ships encountered tbe enemy's fleet and were victorious, sinking and burning twenty sail, and taking several more. Tbe loss was a hundred and twenty men, including brave old General Deane. His body was brought to Woolwich, and thence conveyed for burial, at a cost to tbe Commonwealth of \u00a3800. Eleven Dutch prizes and one thousand three hundred prisoners were brought up to Woolwich with the body of General Deane. A few days after bis death the Dutch met with another severe defeat and sued for peace, one of their pinnaces, carrying a white flag on tbe mast, sailing up the Thames on June tbe 23 rd. Woolwich was the port from which most of the ships for these engagements were despatched, and its officials were very much worried both in bringing tbe vessels forward and in supplying them with sailors and soldiers, who at that time did duty as marines. Press-gangs. \u2014 The rigours of the press-gang were in full force, and we read in the year 1654 of Corporal Hastings, of tbe Victory, at Woolwich, who was engaged with two others in conveying fifteen pressed men in a boat off the dockyard, when the men fell upon their guard and severely wounded the corporal, leaving him half dead. They then steered the boat ashore and escaped. The Government gave to the corporal as compensation \u00a34 10s., and to one of his men, named Welch, who was also wounded, 30s. It was customary to send to this and the other ports the pressed men from various parts of tbe country. A town would be required to raise a certain number, as it might have raised militia, and it was optional r2"], [394, "256 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. to do this either by forcing unwilling recruits or paying volunteers. In 1652 the parish authorities of Southwold reported : \u2014 We have pressed fourteen men for the navy at 12s. each, and sent them to Woolwich. Our town might have afforded more seamen, but we had eighty in the service before the order came to hand. Only one volunteer came in on the beat of \u25a0drum, many being gone the week before. Prosperity and Enmity. \u2014 Under Cromwell we find Woolwich once more taking tbe leading rank amongst tbe dockyards, and again we naturally look for attacks upon her premier position. In 1655, when vigorously assailed, she found a strenuous vindicator in Mr. John Packwood, Clerk of the Cheque in the dockyard, who wrote a report to the Admiralty giving bis \" reasons for maintaining that it is of greater advantage to the State to have ships fitted out at Woolwich than elsewhere, though some have maintained tbe contrary.\" Foremost among its antagonists was its own master-attendant, Captain Badiley, who disliked Woolwich from his first appointment to the dockyard, and reported emphatically that there was great danger to ships riding at anchor, as Woolwich was \" a bad road.\" That was his opinion on November 20th, 1655, and on November 26th he followed it up by declaring that the ships afloat were in peril from the ice, while on December 10th he protested that he had had great difficulty in saving the Speaker from sinking after the ice had damaged her. Cromwell either disregarded or discounted these criticisms, or bad perhaps more weighty matters to attend to, for he kept Woolwich at work and Badiley to look after it as before, and made no change while he held the reins of the kingdom. Arrears of Wages. \u2014 The Commonwealth, however, was no panacea for an impoverished State, and all the taxes which the Govern ment could levy were insufficient to keep creditors quiet and pay current expenses. In 1655 there were two hundred and seventy-two workmen in Woolwich dockyard, but they were all claimants for wages in arrear ; and at the Restoration, in 1660, Wilh' a.m Sheldon presented an estimate of wages due to tbe men for the previous six months, and found it \u00a39,900, or an average of \u00a338 apiece ! The nation, exhausted and unsettled by internal commotions, was for many years afterwards unable to pay its way, and the records are studded with frequent appeals from the officials and workpeople for the payment of their salaries. There are also, not infrequently, requests to be compen sated, or re-instated, from sufferers in the civil wars, all of whom, of course, show that they have been loyal to the party in power. In January, 1657, John Bilton, a shipwright, of Woolwich, begged the Commonwealth to give him an appointment, and represented that he"], [395, "257 WOOLWICH. had been a prisoner in the hands of Prince Rupert, \" who would have given him anything to win him to his service,\" but he was always firm to the Parliament and against the Royal party. Changing Colours. \u2014 The same time-serving policy was seen in all departments, and even the ships partook of it. All the royal names were superseded, such titles as The President and The Speaker came into vogue, only to disappear when the monarchy returned. The Naseby was built here, in the time of the Commonwealth, and was named by the Republicans from the battle so fatal to the Royal cause. At tbe Restoration its name was changed to the Charles, as was the Richard, called after the innocent son of Cromwell, to that of the James. We shall consequently find none of the Cromwellian ships enumerated in the official catalogue. Cromwell and Woolwich. \u2014 Oliver Cromwell, whatever may have been his faults, was a staunch friend to Woolwich, and refused to be blinded by all its calumniators to its advantages as a dockyard. Unlike most naval stations, Woolwich has never had the influence of a powerful patron, there having been in all its history no resident nobleman nor eminent personage with sufficient interest in the place to study its welfare. But, resting entirely upon its merits, it held its supremacy through the whole of the Commonwealth, and therein established the footing which it maintained with more or less success for the next two hundred years. Only One Slip. \u2014 The State declared by an order dated 1650, that there was \" no other dock fit for docking the great ships,\" and for this purpose \"the dock\" at Woolwich was ordered to be kept free. The singular number here employed might be supposed to stand for a yard of several building- slips, but we have proof that there .really was but one slip at this time. This is contained in a recommendation made on December 5th, 1654, for the appointment of Captain Badiley to be master-attendant at Woolwich, in which the argument is, \" there being now two docks there.\" The second of these, as we have just seen (page 255), was a dry dock for repairs, constructed the previous year. Captain Badiley.* \u2014 Captain Badiley was not the first master attendant. That officer was Robert Orchard, appointed at the creation of the post on October 20th, 1653. Badiley afterwards left the dock yard and led a rover's life at sea, but, after many exploits, he returned to spend his declining years at his old post, where he continued to abuse the place as \" the worst reach in the Thames,\" and asked to be relieved of it. This was in 1665, when he was naturally fretting at his cranky"], [396, "258 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. limbs having laid him up in ordinary while the Dutch ships were insulting London. The Hill Boundary. \u2014 Rule and order, as we understand them, had not reached perfection in the seventeenth century. The dockyard was very insecurely protected in 1657, when an order was given to erect \" a fence of waste timber on the hill* against the deal-yard, to prevent embezzlement during tbe night.\" There bad, as we have seen, many times been complaints on this subject, and nearly thirty years earlier (December 7th, 1630) Francis Sheldon, Clerk of the Cheque, complained that only four watchmen were allowed at Woolwich, and they watched by turns. There was also a porter at the gate, but they were all unfurnished with means of defence. \" Within these two nights \" (he says) \" a bark riding close by the dock was surprised by two boats, well manned, who robbed her of her goods, value \u00a340, and escaped undiscovered.\" Loose Supervision. \u2014 Two years subsequent to the Restoration the want of a \" ticket \" system must have impressed itself upon the officials, for an account is given of a number of men and servants who were discovered to be absent when a muster was suddenly called, and all these de faulters were discharged next day. Extra vigilance was apparent in tbe follow ing year (July 18th, 1663), when to prevent embezzle ment of the stores lying in the yard, a man was set to watch at the gate, for which service threepence night and morning was charged. King Charles II. \u2014 Charles II. 's reign opened inauspiciously at Woolwich. In a letter from Andrew Newport to Sir R. Leveson, dated December llth, 1660, it is said: \u2014 Charles II. On Saturday night last one of the King's frigates lying at Woollage with the port-holes of the lowest tier of ordnance * The position of this hill, previously described as \" the cliff,\" is marked by the rising ground in Church Street."], [397, "259 WOOLWICH. open, the seamen being asleep, rolling by the strength of the great wind, took in so much water at the portholes that she sunk, and the men in her were drowned. At low water she lies pretty bare, and they have got some of her guns out already, and hope to weigh her up too. This ship was the Assurance, which, according to Captain Badiley's report, was overturned by an extraordinary gust of wind, and drowned twenty men. The sad event is also reported in Mr. Pepys's diary. Probably it is the guns of this ship that are referred to in a minute of the Navy Commissioners of February 25th, 1661, relating to the repair of \" the chain that is broken at Woolwich and taking up the lost guns, lest others may do it.\" Early Extensions. \u2014 It was about this time, the beginning of Charles II. 's reign, that the dockyard began to make some growth. In 1663 additional ground was taken from Dr. Gilbourne on lease for seventeen years. This ground had previously served the purposes of a wharf, and as such had been hired and used by the Govern ment, but it was not found altogether serviceable, and it had to be raised considerably at tbe water front and filled in from behind with marsh earth. Nevertheless, the owner attached a substantial value to his property, and when the Admiralty were negotiating for a lease he asked, in consideration of his outlay, \u00a31,200 in cash, together with a rent of \u00a3132 per annum for the first six years, and \u00a3182 per annum for the residue of eleven years. Tbe property was described as two ballast quays, two ballast pits, two limekilns, and two tenements, from which description it would appear that the extension was westward. Dimensions in 1663. \u2014 When completed (in 1663) the eastern wharf contained \"in front and at both ends\" water frontages of 397 feet and it was 18 feet deep on its river face. The western wharf contained by similar measurement 375 feet frontage, and the embank ment was 19 feet deep. The Merry Monarch. \u2014 King Charles II. unquestionably took an interest in this dockyard, but it is too certain that his anxieties on its behalf were only such as may be imagined from his frivolous and selfish character. No monarch bad ever been such a constant visitor to Woolwich, but the cause of his solicitude was not the war-ships which were to guard bis kingdom, but merely tbe building of bis pleasure yacht. The correspondence which took place concerning the keel-piece of this precious craft is most elaborate and amusing. The keel-piece was in tbe first place a long while coming, and the King was terribly impatient for his toy. At last the keel-piece arrived and was found to be rotten, at which the King was fearfully wroth. Then a new one was built by a man named Graves, who was a long while getting his"], [398, "260 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. money, and bothered tbe King a good deal. Even when the yacht was finished the trouble did not cease, for Christopher Pett demanded shot to ballast her, and the Admiralty told him to use stones, to which he answered that stones sufficient would half fill the cabins and make the vessel run to leeward. It was represented that the service would suffer if so much of tbe war stores were devoted to this purpose ; but the king's amusement outweighed the national weal, and he got his ballast \u2014 about forty tons of iron shot and leaden bullets. The yacht cost \u00a31,800, and probably \u00a3200 more for ballast. The Duke of York, brother to the king, also had his yacht built here. Holidays. \u2014 The workmen of the yard were kept so hard at their toil over these and other works that they were denied part of their customary holidays, and on May 12th, 1663, they entreated allowance for a whole day's holiday, as on the previous Gunpowder Plot Day and Coronation Day they worked till noon and had no breakfast-time. They were so busy, indeed, that in this same year, when the East Indian ships had to be docked at Woolwich, men from Deptford were requisitioned to help. Royal Visits. \u2014 There are numerous recorded visits of the King at this period, such as the following : \u2014 1664. September 23rd. \u2014 The King has been to Woolwich to view and hasten the ships. The drums still beat for men to go to New Guinea with Prince Rupert. Catharine of Braganza. \u2014 Queen Catharine of Braganza, wife of Charles IL, paid a visit in this same year (1664), which is thus related by Mrs. Strickland : \u2014 Catharine went with her ladies in her state barge to see a ship launched at Woolwich, October 26th, 1664. The wind and waves were so rough that day, that the Duchess of Buckingham and the fair Mistress Boynton, one of her maids of honour, were as much indisposed as if they had been at sea. The Queen alone felt no incon venience. The King, the Duke of York, and the French .Ambassador came in the royal carriages by land. The ship, which was built by Pett, was successfully launched, and much admired by the King, who said, \" she had the finest bow that he ever saw ; \" and the French Ambassador gives a lively description of the grandeur and beauty of the vessel, which carried seventy guns. Charles behaved very graciously on this occasion to the veteran naval commanders of the Commonwealth who were present. He told the French Ambassador in his jocose way, before them,\" that they had all had the plague, but were now perfectly cured of the malady, and were less likely to have it again than others.\" They then went down to the Nore in the newly launched vessel, and returned in the royal yacht, when they partook of a noble 1 lanquet. The King's carriages were tc meet them again at Woolwich. Meantime, a very rough swell came on ; the hail and rain descended in torrents ; every lady but the Queen was sea-sick ; and she, who had come with her ladies from Whitehall to Woolwich in the royal barge, and was expected to return the same way, played his Majesty and the gentlemen a sly trick, by stealing on shore with her ladies, and taking possession of the coaches which had been sent for the King and the"], [399, "WOOLWICH. 261 Ambassador, \" making it,\" complains his excellency \" her pleasure to see the other unfortunates suffering from the effects of the tempest, and not caring what became of us. It was impossible for us to get to London in the barge, and we were obliged to get horses and carriages at Greenwich to take us to Whitehall.\" Strikes for Pay. \u2014 Court affairs, however, did not greatly interest the subjects of Charles IL, and want of faith in the Government was the common failing of all its servants. In 1665 W. Acworth, an officer ofthe dockyard, reported that \u2014 The Loyal Katherine is at Woolwich, but soldiers ordered for that ship refuse to come on board until their arrears, amounting to \u00a31 3s. 4d. per man, are paid. The arrears were promised as soon as they got on board, but only 120 accepted the promise ; the others did not believe it and went away. In the same year also (October 3rd) Christopher Pett asks authority to \"press caulkers and shipwrights,\" and begs some payment to tbe workmen on account of their diligence and great distress. Anxious Times. \u2014 At this period, it must be confessed, the need was urgent and the pressure overpowering. The State was poor, and was kept poor by recklessness, extravagance, and vice ; the Great Plague was upon us, and our old foes, the Dutch, smarting under their last punishment, were threatening to ascend the Thames and plunder London. No fewer than 68,596 deaths resulted from tbe plague in this one year, and many occurred at Woolwich. The Plague. \u2014 On November 10th, Christopher Pett reports that \u2014 He cannot get men to work on the Little Prince, on account of the infection on board, but has ordered the ship to be cleaned, and pitch and tar burnt between decks. He begs consideration for Peter Warner, shipwright, who refused his quarter's pay at the table, but will now be glad to receive it, his family being visited with the plague. Horrors accumulate. \u2014 And all the while the enemy thundering at the gate. Read the following extracts from the official records of this unhappy year : \u2014 1665. September. \u2014 Abstract of letter from Christopher Pett to the Navy Commis sioners : \u2014 The plague increases in the town and many of the workmen are dead.

The English sleet is ordered to fall down to the Nore. War, Pestilence, and Famine. \u2014 At no period of our history have tbe afflictions of our people been so heavy to bear. Toiling night and day, with barely sufficient wages to buy bread, worn out with tending the sick, cast down with sorrow for the dead, and all tbe while in daily peril of being trodden under tbe heel of an invader, our artisan population was in the very depths of misery. Not only had we the of the several of his Majesty's shipps heere in harbor, prizes and others, which are six in number, whereby your honours may be satesffied of theire present conditiones, and which of them will soonest flitted out to sea.

The English navy was, however, resolute and strong, and some victories were achieved close to our shores which proved very disas trous and discouraging to our foes, many of whose ships were sunk or captured. Prisoners Of War.\u2014 Victory, however, was not without its alloy at Woolwich, as it was here that the conquering Prince Rupert sent most of his prisoners to be housed and fed. In the latter part of 1665 three ships laden with Dutch captives, one alone containing six hundred, were brought to Woolwich in company with numerous prizes, and tbe workmen of the dockyard found ample employment in fitting and arming the enemy's ships for future use. But tbe prisoners were a painful encumbrance, and sickness was rife among them. Yain efforts were put forth to beat away tbe plague. Sailors were forbidden to go to London, and their wives were not allowed to visit them, several having been seen in the streets \" with plague-spots about them.\" It was deemed so unsafe to procure clothing from the infected district that our soldiers and sailors were in rags, and all tbe while tbe plague came steadily on. John Evelyn. \u2014 At this juncture the Government called upon Mr. Evelyn to act as Commissioner for the sick and wounded and prisoners in Kent, and, deserting the pleasure and safety of bis country seat, be established himself in the thick of his work at Deptford, and nobly set about tbe fulfilment of bis trust. He found bis charges in all the towns and villages which lie between Chatham and London, and all that man could do for the alleviation of their sufferings they owed to his tender hand and gentle influence. At Woolwich the Loyal Katherine, before mentioned, was furnished as a hospital ship, and lay off tbe town full of sick and wounded men, and urgent appeals for help from such as Evelyn awoke the charitable heart of England. On October 3rd, 1665, Evelyn wrote to Pepys from Sayes Court, Deptford, as follows :- \u2014 \u25a0 At Woolwich they refuse to take the sick and wounded men from the com manders in ships, on pretence of a fear of contagion, while they in the meanwhile suffer others to tipple in the alehouse ; and Sir Theophilus Biddulph wishes to spare Greenwich, because of your sitting there, and Deptford, in regard of his Majesty's yard. I would be glad to know, since Chatham and Gravesend can hold no more, and that I have peopled all the intermediate villages, what I shall do with these miserable creatures. I have the importunity of a thousand clamours at my doors, which neither lets me rest day nor night. A.D. 1666. \u2014 Winter came and mercifully prevailed over the plague,"], [402, "264 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. and in January, 1666, the visitation had so much abated that the King, who had fled from London, found courage to return. One of his first acts was a judicious command that the Dutch prisoners should be allowed to go on shore on parole from the ships at Woolwich and work at their trades for a subsistence, which the poor fellows, \"being in great necessity,\" were only too happy to do. Tbe agreement with them stipulated that they should work for board wages, but within a fortnight the \" foreign shipwrights \" were petitioning for their wretched pay, and Christopher Pett was more than ever perplexed by pecuniary complications. His carpenters intimated that they should not work much longer for \" twelvepence per day,\" and he was at his wit's end for money to pay them even so much. The Fire of London. \u2014 -The same year (1666), to complete the consensus of tribulations, tbe Great Fire of London occurred. This, with tbe plague and the war, created such dire distress, despair, and recklessness, that the Kent Militia were called out to preserve order and prevent crime. Providentially, the herring fishery was very abundant this year, and it was said bere that \"twelve herrings a penny filled many a belly.\" Another agreeable feature of a terrible year was the loyalty of the North American colonists, who, to help their country against ber foes, sent over from New England, to Woolwich, two masts one hundred feet long as a present to Charles II. from Massachusetts. Invasion. \u2014 But the war continued and extended, the Dutch, elated by some successes, growing more and more audacious. By the summer of 1667 they bad made all their arrangements for an invasion, and came down on us with the vehemence of a hail- storm. The follow ing are some of the dockyard reports at this crisis : \u2014 1667. June 15th. \u2014 Captains Lake and Burke report that they have sunk their ships at Woolwich. Sir F. Holiis publishes a further order for sinking six ships at Woolwich, and eight hoys with four guns each, and 4,000 tons of stones in the ships. June llth. \u2014 Sir F. Holiis was ordered to send down to Gravesend all the fireships under his command, in company with the frigates under Sir W. Jennings to support the men making the fortifications, and \" to continue there unless he finds the enemy near and too strong, in which case he is to retreat and come up the river.\" Signed by Sir W. Batten, and dated at Woolwich, June 17th, 1667. June 18th. \u2014 Christopher Pett reports being actively employed planting ordnance in the town and yard ; the men w*orking night and day fitting out fireships, &c, and cannot hold out much longer. 1667.

A hundred sail of the enemy are at the Nore. June 29th.\u2014 The Dutch Fleet of 120 sail still roves between the Gun Fleet and the Downs, and two days ago came into the river, within five miles of Gravesend, which"], [403, "WOOLWICH. 265 gave a fright, Woolwich and Chatham being unprovided. If they had had the courage to come on shore when they got to Chatham they might have spoiled all that was in the river, up to the Tower. Sir Edward Spragg, vice-admiral, now defends Woolwich. The Town in Peril. \u2014 It was a gloomy outlook, indeed, for the whole kingdom, and especially for the inhabitants of tbe riverside towns of Gravesend and Woolwich, at either one of which the enemy, if he had effected a landing, would probably have commenced his ravages. The Dutch had already captured Sheerness and sailed about the Lower Hope, but, leaving the Thames, had proceeded up the Med way to attack Chatham, where the terrible De Ruyter not only broke an iron chain stretched across the stream, but actually passed over the twelve sunken ships by which the Duke of Albemarle attempted to check his advance. Fireships destroyed a number of King Charles's vessels in Chatham Harbour, and then De Ruyter, scarcely damaged, fell back upon the Thames, with tbe evident intention of extending his hostilities by tbe next tide to Woolwich, if not even to London Bridge. Everywhere in this locality tbe utmost alarm prevailed, and families fled from their homes, crying, \" We are betrayed, let it light where it will.\"* For want of ready money Parliament bad paid off our clamorous seamen with tickets bearing interest. Many of these men joined the enemy in disgust, and were heard to call out from on board the Dutch fleet : \" We fought for tickets before, now we fight for dollars. We have come for tbe money for our tickets.\" Peace. \u2014 It is due to the good sense and moderation of tbe French king at this critical time, rather than to any virtues of the English Government, that tbe ruin of the nation was averted. France had no desire to push matters to extremities. She had put a check upon the supremacy of the English navy by playing off the Dutchmen, and, being satisfied, she recalled ber allies. England was only too glad to conclude a discreditable war by a dishonourable peace, and a treaty which sullies our whole history was signed on tbe 10th of July. A poem published at this time, supposed to have been written by Sir John Denham, and entitled \" Advice to a Painter,\" contains the following trenchant lines : \u2014 \" Painter, let thine art describe a story Shaming our warlike island's ancient glory ; Make the Dutch fleet, while we supinely sleep, AVithout opposers, masters of the deep ; Make, them securely the Thames's mouth invade, At once depriving us of that and trade ; * Letter of John Rushworth."], [404, "266 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Draw Woolwich, Deptford, London, and the Tower Meanly abandoned to a foreign power ; Yet turn their first attempt another way, And let their cannons upon Sheerness play ; Their canvas swelling with a prosperous gale, Swift as our fears make them to Chatham sail.\" Consequences. \u2014 The effects of the peace upon Woolwich, with which we are chiefly concerned at present, were a glut of ships, soldiers, and sailors, and a sudden stoppage of work. We note the following report from Barking Reach : \u2014 1667, July 24th. \u2014 Captain J. Pearce is ready to sail, but wants sixty lusty soldiers who may be sent on board his ship at the Halfway Tree, in two hours, AAroolwich being full of them. The Sunken Ships. \u2014 Directly the war was over the King was once more bothered by claimants for justice. Tbe ships which had been sunk at Woolwich in such frantic haste were the first which came to hand, and amongst them was a French vessel sent to fetch prisoners by exchange from Woolwich. The master of this ship, which was described as a fly-boat of four hundred and forty tons, was Jean Kerkboven, and he now sent in a demand in which he stated that he was employed by the French king to proceed from Dunkirk for prisoners, and that he bad on board provisions for three hundred men, but that his boat was sunk with all in it by tbe English king's Commissioners \" on approach of tbe Hollanders.\" He therefore asked for the restoration of his vessel, or another in its place, which he doubtless received, for Charles appears to have been, like most spend thrifts, as prodigal in satisfying bis creditors as in getting into debt. Tbe sunken ships were soon raised, and in July, 1667, the Earl of Anglesey, Treasurer of tbe Navy, paid \u00a3300 for \"weighing tbe ships lately sunk at Woolwich and Blackwall,\" but they must have been considerably tbe worse for their immersion, and appear to have been taken altogether off their owners' bands. What ultimately became of them may be inferred from the following minutes in the Admiralty books : \u2014 1667. Aug. \u2014 Captain Simmonds, late commander of the Exhibition frigate, petitions the King for an old fireship of small value lately sunk at Woolwich. He had diligently served under Prince Rupert at AVoolwich and Sheerness since the Dutch came on the coast, and had \u00a33000 of his personal property taken from him by De Ruyter. Sept. 1th.\u2014 The widow of Phineas Pett* (slain in the Tiger, May 2nd, 1666) peti tions the King for one of the old ships lately sunk at Woolwich, as her husband left her in debt and there is \u00a3380 due to her on a broad seal of the late king. * Son of Captain John Pett, and grandson of the great and original Phineas Pett. (See page 252.;"], [405, "267 AVOOLWICH. Fortification of Woolwich. \u2014 Although there were protests against the unprotected state of Woolwich during the peril of war, some attempt was certainly made to fortify and defend it, for which purpose timber from the dockyard was taken to the other extremity of the town, where the earthworks were constructed and tbe guns were mounted. The King himself came down to see tbe progress of these works on May 28th, 1667. This part ofthe subject will have to be referred to hereafter. Tbe war finished, the dockyard almost collapsed, and, as early as the August following, Christopher Pett entreated the King for money or timber to carry on the works, as \" the workmen and their families are in great necessity, and many sick and perishing in the town for want.\" Almost at the same time he pressed for the return of \" the timber lent to the Ordnance for fortifying tbe town,\" and to this extent he was satisfied so soon as the earthworks were dismantled, but be did not greatly succeed in improving tbe condition of his workmen. Forced Labour. \u2014 And yet, though the exchequer was bankrupt, and tbe State compelled to pay its creditors by giving them old ships, the King contrived to carry out a project upon which be had set his mind, the building of a \"mast and reed-house*\" in Woolwich Dock yard, even though he had to accomplish his design by forced labour : \u2014 1667. Sept. 10th.\u2014 Chris. Pett reports that he has pressed several carpenters for carrying on the mast and reed-house, but they have got discontented and most of them have left work. He suggests that two or three ofthe ringleaders shall be clapped into the Marshalsea and severely punished. Several of the caulkers are also absent, and he asks that the Admiralty marshal shall force them to work or carry them to prison. Sept. 16th.\u2014 Christopher Pett replies to a letter from the Navy Commissioners in which they ask him, in the names of his Royal Highness and the Council, to lend money for paying the fleet. He says that he is likely to lose \u00a3500 which he has paid already for timber, and that he is so meanly paid that he can hardly keep his family. He has been twenty years in the place and has eleven children. Oct.\u2014 Chris. Pett reports that he cannot get on for want of tar, but has borrowed a little from the ropeyard. Most of the sawyers are sick or dead, and all the men are much discouraged for want of money.

PEPYS AT WOOLWICH, The Prince Of Diarists. \u2014 Our share of the gratitude which all posterity will owe to the memory of Samuel Pepys, the Admiralty official, who has left us such a delightful diary of the times in which he lived,* is by no means small, for Pepys resided with his family at Woolwich for a time, and makes some interesting allusions to the place in connection with the Plague, the Fire, and the Dutch invasion. It is probable that Pepys lived at a house in the dockyard while he was absent from his town residence, which was near to the Tower of London, and close to the spot known as Barking Churchyard. His diary, which is written in all the secrecy and sincerity of cipher, contains the following references to Woolwich : \u2014 The \"Assurance\" Capsized, \u2014 We are first mentioned in connec tion with the accident to the ship Assurance, of which we have been told \u2014 1660.

July 26th. \u2014 To Greenwich, where the King and Duke are come hy water this morn from Hampton Court. They asked me several questions. The King having \u25a0dined, I went in the barge with him down to Woolwich, and there I just saw and kissed my wife, and saw some of her painting, which is very curious, and away again to the King, and back again with him in the barge. Aug. 21st. \u2014 Messengers went to get a boat for me to carry me to Woolwich, but all to no purpose ; so I was forced to walk it in the darke, with Sir J.

Oct. 26th. \u2014 At Woolwich ; I there went up to the King and Duke. Here I staid above with them while the ship was launched, which was done with great success ; and the King did very much like the ship, saying she had the very best bow he ever saw. By and by the Queene comes and her maids of honour ; one whereof, Mrs. Boynton, and the Duchess of Buckingham, had been very sick coming by water in the barge (the water being very rough) ; but what silly sport they made with them, in very common terms, methought was very poor, and below what people think these great people do. The launching being done, the King and company went down to take barge, and I sent for Mr. Pett (he had built the ship), and put the flagon into the Duke's hand, and he in the presence of the King, did give it to Mr. Pett, taking it upon his knee.

Coventry to have the Duke of York's permission to pull down houses rather than lose this office, which would much liinder the King's business. So Sir AV. Penn wrote down this night in order to the sending them up to-morrow morning. Sept. 5th. \u2014 I lay down in the office, being mighty weary. About two in the morning my wife calls me up and tells me of new cries of fire at the bottom of our lane.

There, when I come, I found the gates shut, but no guard kept at all, which troubled me. I got the gates open and to Mr. Sheldon's, where I locked up my gold and charged my wife and W. Hewer never to leave the room without one of them in it night or day. Sept. 7th.\u2014 Blessed be God, all well. . . .

At night come home Sir W. Batten and W. Pen, who only can tell me that they have placed guns at Woolwich and Deptford, and sunk some ships below AVoolwich and Blackwall, and are in hopes that they will stop the enemy's coming up.

James II. and William III. \u2014 Charles II. died in 1685; but neither his death nor tbe succession of James II. made much improve ment in the solvency of the State, the happiness of the people, or tbe progress of Woolwich dockyard. James's short and troublous reign of three years tended only to make matters worse, and on his abdication and flight down tbe Thames in 1688, William III., Prince of Orange, and Mary bis wife, came to the inheritance of a bankrupt exchequer. After a time prospects began to mend, but not too rapidly, nor at any time, it is feared, to tbe King's complete satisfaction. Shish, Father and Son. \u2014 Among the MSS. of this century are letters and reports from Thomas Shish, who was master-shipwright at Woolwich in succession to his father Jonas, who was, I suppose, successor to tbe Petts. In the church of St. Nicholas, Deptford, is a grey marble monument inscribed to \u2014 \"Jonas Shish, Esq., master-shipwright to King Charles II. of His Majesty's yards at Deptford and Woolwich, who departed this life May the 7th, 1680, in the seventy fifth year of his age Also John, his eldest son, master-shipwright of Deptford, died Oct. 16th, 1686, aged forty-three ; and Thomas, the third son, master-shipwright of Woolwich, died Dec. 6th, 1685, aged thirty-seven years.\" * See Plate XXVIII. tMr. Evelyn says in his diary under June 18th, 1667 : \"Alarmed by the Dutch, who were fallen on our fleete at Chatham, went to see the work at Woolwich \u2014 a battery to prevent them from coming up to London, which Prince Rupert com manded, and sunk some ships in the river.\" Throughout his copious diary this is the only mention the accomplished author of \" Sylva \" makes of AVoolwich, though he lived at Deptford and performed responsible functions under the State. He makes however, a casual reference to the place in the letter mentioned at page 263."], [418, "276 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. The Unpaid Workmen. \u2014 Woolwich Dockyard bad an uneventful time under the Shishes, but we always find that tbe workmen were in straits for their wages, whoever was shipwright or whoever was king. There is a petition, dated 20th December, 1694, from the shipwrights and other workmen in Woolwich and Deptford yards, complaining that their wages were twelve months in arrear ; and another document making a similar complaint to the Treasury in May, 1697. Again, in 1710, came a memorial from tbe shipwrights and ropemakers objecting to be paid in Queen Anne's Exchequer Bills, and asking for \" six months' more wages.\" And then we find a state paper of June 30th, 1712, stating that the Commissioners of the Navy had agreed to discharge about four hundred workmen from Woolwich and Deptford, and demand ing about \u00a312,000 to pay them off. At the same time they announced their intention of making reductions at Chatham, Sheerness, Ports mouth, and Plymouth, \" the workmen being in a very miserable condition, and a year and three quarters in arrear.\" Under such a financial system as this it was impossible to carry on tbe public works in a creditable or economical manner, and there was continual trouble and delay in the course of business. Coercion. \u2014 Occasionally, to encourage the others, mechanics and labourers who refused to work without pay were seized and flogged, put in tbe stocks, or pressed into tbe navy, but it cannot truthfully be said that either AVilliam III. or his two successors quite succeeded in solving the fiscal difficulty. As recently as 1739, upon November 5th, a battalion of tbe Guards and a troop of cavalry marched from London to Woolwich to \" quiet the workmen in that yard,\" who had \" mutinied about their pay and refused to work ;\" but we do not hear of any more complaints of arrears after this, and may suppose that under the better management of tbe Brunswickers tbe nation bad contrived to get along without a running debt with its artisans and labourers. Improvements. \u2014 Yet William was a wise and fairly prudent sovereign, and one of bis early measures was to strengthen the navy and improve tbe dockyards. Woolwich yard, which had been patched and pieced many times during the preceding hundred and fifty years, had by this time extended to a length of eight hundred feet, stretching westward to \" Tbe Pow of Trees,\" which stood in the recess by tbe Black Eagle tavern.* The trees, which were ten in number, are shown in a plan of the dockyard drawn by Milton in 1753, and partly copied on page 278. William, however, set himself the rather to improve the efficiency of the dockyard than to enlarge it, and although he took in * This spot was still known as \" The Row of Trees \" by old inhabitants forty years ago, and some of the trees were standing at the beginning of this century."], [419, "Woolwich in 1708.

Thus : Value before the Revolution (1688) . . . . 669 Expended on improvements ,\u00a36132 Present value (1698) \u00a315 goi The Dockyard Enlarged.\u2014 It was reserved for King George II. to make the next enlargement, in the seventeenth year of bis reign, 1734. In that year an Act of Parliament was passed to acquire \" land and wharf near the dockyard,\" which was sold by Bowater to the Royal Navy Commissioners for the sum of \u00a33,299 10s. This addition carried tbe dockyard as far as the pre sent main gate, which was two hundred feet beyond the former boundary. The new officers' quarters (or \" lodg ings \" as they were called), were built, and tbe yard, though but half its present size, was thought to have extended far enough. It George II. was bounded westward by tbe road leading from the sandpits (now Dockyard Station) to the Sand Quay, by meadows, and by marsh. The number of building slips increased to seven, but none were permanently covered until long afterwards. The gate was still at Church Hill, but there was a second entrance next the officers' quarters. More Additions. \u2014 The rapid growth of tbe navy, however, more than kept pace with the dockyards. Before many years more space was demanded, and it was noted as a special defect of Woolwich yard that it had no room for the storage of timber, nor convenience for the number of workmen. But so it went on fifty years, when (in 1784) tbe Mast Pond, two new slips for building ships of the line, and new storehouses were added, and part of Mr. Harden's farm on the west appears to have been at the same time purchased of the Bowaters. The ground taken for the new erections was enclosed with high thick walls, which, on account of the marshes, were piled under the foundations. The act under which this additional land was acquired was passed"], [422, "278 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. for tbe purpose of enabling John Bowater to \" grant leases \" for extending the dockyard.

The ship had been slightly careened over, by shifting tbe guns to windward, in order to get at and repair a pipe below the water-line on the other side, when a sudden gust of wind washed the sea into her ports, and, in the words of the poet Cowper \u2014 \" Down went the Royal George, With twice four hundred men.

THE LATER DAYS OP THE DOCKYARD, Arctic Expeditions. \u2014 Woolwich has been the starting-point of expeditions from the earliest times to the latest, and has prepared for many of the daring adventures in which brave Britons have risked and given up their lives, including most of the enterprises undertaken in the hope of finding the long-wished-for northern passage to India. Mr. Phineas Pett, in the reign of James I., fitted out an early Arctic expedition, for upon the North-West Passage his young master Henry, Prince of Wales, had set his heart. It consisted of two ships, the Resolution and Discovery, which sailed in April, 1612, but did not return until after the Prince's untimely death in November, 1612.

Franklin and his brave companions in the summer of 1845.* Her Majesty's ships Erebus and Terror were placed at his command, and were fitted out with great care at Woolwich, under the direction of Sir John himself. He had previously made three voyages to the Arctic seas, and this time he was to attempt to circum navigate America. The Erebus and Terror were, like their com mander, seasoned to the work. They had both been engaged in the South Polar Expedition in 1839-1843, under the command of Captain Sir James Ross. The Terror had previously visited the Arctic regions, being tbe vessel in which Sir George Back, in 1836, attempted by \"way of Sir John Franklin. Wager River,\" to trace tbe northern boundary of tbe American con tinent, but, after encountering extraordinary perils among the ice, she was compelled to return home in 1837. This was the fifty-seventh Arctic expedition from England, commencing with Cabot's voyage (temp. Henry VII.), and Sir John Franklin's was the fifty-eighth. The vessels were put in commission at Woolwich on Tuesday, March 4th, and sailed on Monday, May 17th. Sir John Franklin was appointed to the Erebus (the larger vessel), with Commander James Fitzjames, Lieutenant Henry J. D. de Vescoute ; mate, Charles H. Des Voux ; second master, H. F. Collins ; clerk, G. F. Pinhorn ; gunner, J. G. Robinson; boatswain, J. G. Terry; carpenter, W. Weekes. Captain F. R. M. Crosier commanded the Terror, with Lieu tenant Edward Little, and Lieutenant G. H. Hodgson ; carpenter, Thomas Honey. The provisions embarked were considerable, and consisted of pre served provisions of various kinds, a large quantity of tea, and extra strong West Indian rum, 35 per cent, over proof. The consumption was provided for a prolonged expedition. Ten fine live oxen also were shipped at the Woolwich Dockyard on board the Barrett o, hired trans port ship, which accompanied the discovery vessels to the edge of * Many of the Arctic explorers, including Franklin himself, were well known at Woolwich.

Each ship was supplied with two hundred tin cylinders for the pur pose of holding papers to be thrown overboard, with the statement of the longitude and other particulars worthy of record, written in six different languages. Lost in the Ice. \u2014 From the time when the tender left the ships in the north seas, not one of their brave crews (in number one hundred and thirty-five, all told), was ever seen alive, so far as we know, by any but themselves. As time passed the most intense anxiety was felt for them in England, and several relief expeditions were sent out by tbe Government, by Lady Franklin, and others. Departure of Sir J. TRoss, 1848. \u2014 Sir James Ross, with the Enterprize and Investigator, left Woolwich the 12th of June, 1848, and returned November, 1849. Sir Edward Belcher's expedition sailed Departure of Captain Ross, 1848, from Woolwich 15th April, 1852, Belcher being in the Enterprize, and having with him the Resolute, Captain ETellett ; Forth Star, Captain Pullen ; Intrepid, Captain McClintock ; and Pioneer, Captain Sherard Osborn. This expedition was likewise disastrous, and Captain Belcher and his party only saved themselves by abandoning theii _aips and meeting with rescuers, May, 1854. It was afterwards ascertained by Captain McClintock, of the Fox, that the two ships were beset by ice on September 12th, 1846. Franklin died June llth, 1847, and the ships were abandoned April"], [430, "284 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 22nd, 1848. The whole of the officers and crew are believed to have perished in that year. Royal Embarkations. \u2014 Much of this history being made up, after tbe manner of histories in general, of the doings of Royalty, it may be remarked that, until the present happy reign, Woolwich was not much thought of by the ruling monarch as a port for embarkation. The favourite places were either London or Blackwall, Gravesend or Dover. A newspaper of August 12th, 1822, reports that when George IV. went to Scotland in that year he embarked at Blackwall in the steam yacht Royal George, and tells us that \u2014 His Majesty was standing on deck opposite the town of Woolwich, and was wel comed by a royal salute from the batteries, and three sloops of war that happened to be stationed there. The yards of these vessels were manned, and all their different flags were flying. The sailors cheered when the King passed them, as did also the workmen in the dockyards and public works. At two of them a large flag was dis played, on which was inscribed, \" Long live King George the Fourth.\" At the arsenal, the Artillery, the Sappers and Miners, a regiment of infantry (the Buffs, we believe), and a troop of cavalry were drawn out at the water's edge to meet his Majesty. The standard of England was hoisted on the church. Royal Early Rising. \u2014 Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were, however, several times at the Dockyard, it being their point of departure for Scotland and tbe Continent, in the early years of their marriage. Both possessing tbe royal virtue of early rising, the Dock yard and Garrison officials were careful on these occasions not to oversleep themselves. For instance, we are told that on \u2014 August 29th, 1843. \u2014 The Queen and Prince Albert embarked for Scotland at ten minutes to 7 a.m., having driven down from London. They were conveyed in a pinnace from the Dockyard Stairs to the royal yacht George, and there was a great multitude present and great enthusiasm. The Queen wore a blue silk dress, a white silk bonnet, and a splendid Paisley shawl. September, 8th 1844. \u2014 The Queen and Prince Albert embarked at Woolwich Dockyard for Scotland on board the royal yacht Victoria and Albert. The Queen wore court mourning. On one of these occasions, when Victoria and her consort were accompanied by their children, the Princess Royal and Prince of Wales, the street ballad girls sang : \u2014 We'll sing so keen, God save the Queen, Her husband and her son and daughter ; She sails away from Woolwich town To visit Scotland o'er the water. So noble looks the River Thames, Thousands will be on the water To see old England's blooming Queen From Woolwich town take her departure ;"], [431, "WOOLWICH. 285 She gives command, and off she goes To where some noble friends will mind her ; She bids adieu to Woolwich town \u2014 That pretty spot she leaves behind her. The \"Trafalgar.\"\u2014 The presence ofthe Queen and Prince Albert at some important launches was also the occasion of much excitement, in testimony of which I present a short report of tbe launch of the Trafalgar, 120 guns, on June 21st, 1841 : \u2014 Of all the sights which have attracted pleasure-seekers within the last twelve years, none will be recorded as having produced greater interest than the launch of the Trafalgar. The roads from London swarmed with carriages and pedestrians\u2014 coaches and four by dozens, coaches and pair by hundreds ; barouches, gigs, phaetons innumerable ; coronets and mitres, rich hammercloths emblazoned in silver, the more humble carriages, and the patent cab, passed before the eye in incessant line. Launch of the \" Trafalgar,\" 1841 Almost every shop in Woolwich was closed. From fifty to a hundred steamers and yachts carried joyous freights of people on the river, and if ever there was life upon the waters it was that day. The Queen, accompanied by Prince Albert and an immense suite, alighted at a stage covered with green cloth for her soft feet to tread upon, she in whom were centred all the nation's hopes \u2014 \" The fondly reared, the fair, Gladdening all eyes to see.\" Her Majesty wore a bright blue silk dress and a white drawn bonnet with roses. Prince Albert also looked very well \u2014 pale, as he always does, but certainly with no symptoms of consumption. The bottle of wine with which the christening was performed was one of those which Nelson had on board the Victory at the battle of Trafalgar. Lady Bridport, Nelson's niece, performed the ceremony. Nelson's sister, Mrs. Matcham, was also present, and the survivors of the memorable battle. As the dogshores were knocked away the great leviathan glided slowly and majestically off the stocks, amid thunders of applause and the booming of guns. To this we may add Longfellow's elegant lines : \u2014 \" She starts, she moves, she seems to feel The thrill of life along her keel ; T"], [432, "286 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. And, spurning with her foot the ground, With one exulting joyous bound She leaps into the w*ater's arms.\" -* The Royal Albert.\" \u2014 Another royal launch of especial note was that of the Royal Albert, on Saturday, May loth, 1854, when the Queen, accompanied by ber consort, the Princess Royal, the Prince of Wales, Prince Alfred, and the Duchess of Kent, was present in the midst of sixty thousand spectators. England and Russia were at the beginning of the war, and the bombardment of Odessa had just drawn peculiar attention to the Navy, to which the Royal Albert was now to be added as an important member. The royal party arrived by road punctually at one o'clock, and were received by a guard of honour Launch ofthe \"Royal Alliert,\" 1854, composed of the cadets from the Royal Military Academy. The Queen christened the ship with a bottle of wine at tbe third attempt, and the launch was successfully accomplished. The Last Extension. \u2014 The completion of the Dockyard, as we now see it, was not accomplished until 1843, but several additions were made by purchase from the Bowater estate * during the earlier part of the century, the extension works being, as usual, carried out by convict labour. The ground joined on at the west was for a long while * See plan, page 60."], [433, "WOOLWICH. 287 enclosed for the most part by merely a wooden palisading, and on the 10th of April, 1840, we read\u2014 This morning at eight, one of the convicts in the dockyard escaped during a heavy fog, by pulling out one of the palings bounding the Greenwich Road. The sentry was within a few yards of him and fired his gun, loaded with ball. The whole of the dockyard ought to be surrounded with a high wall. [The man was captured two days afterwards in a field at Charlton.] The progress of the extension works which formed the Albion Road (see page 60) was thus recorded in \u2014 Queen Victoria christening the\" Royed Albert.\" November, 1842. \u2014 For some time past a body of labourers have been engaged in making a new road on the southward of the present Woolwich and Greenwich road, which when completed will be substituted for the old road. The latter will then be broken up and enclosed, with several acres of land, as part of the dockyard. About twenty-five respectable cottages, situated between the dockyard and fields, will be pulled down to carry out the order. This step has been necessary in order to erect numerous workshops for the engineers and millwrights. The Height of its Glory. \u2014 This final extension of the Dockyard was accomplished by the end of 1843, and was the largest, both in extent and expenditure, of all the series. It took, as just stated, the public road, together with rows of cottages on each side of it, and all the space between the road and the river as far as Trinity Street. It included the immense graving dock, the great basins, and tbe new building slips. The steam-engine factory, the mast house, and many other buildings were erected on the new ground, and the triple iron shed was considered a masterpiece of engineering skill. The Dockyard by this additional area was enlarged to fifty-six acres, and bad a river frontage of 3,680 feet. The old dry dock at the eastern end was tbe largest in existence until the new graving dock was built at the western extension. The contractors, Messrs. Grissel and Peto, were paid \u00a380,000 for this work, and they finished it in 1843. The steam-engine factory was built in 1839. t2"], [434, "288 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. The Allied Sovereigns. \u2014 Even prior to this improvement, the mother dock was pronounced superior to any other in the kingdom. In 1814, when the allied sovereigns were at Woolwich, they saw both the Arsenal and the Dockyard, and the Emperor Alexander of Russia exclaimed, \" Good Heavens ! You seem to have preparations for another twenty years' contest, instead of being exhausted with that which you have just concluded.\" The wharf was built in 1818 on a new line of frontage, partly on account of dilapidations and partly to check the accumulation of mud, the dredging of which bad cost in ten years the large sum of \u00a3125,692, and threatened to render tbe yard useless. And thus the old Dockyard, which bad been so long and constantly abused, attacked, and menaced, grew in size and strength and value, and was in its fullest vigour within our own time. But tbe day of its pride Launch of the \" Agamemnon,\" 1854. was the eve of its fall. Although of venerable age, it had no period of infirmity or decay. Its history, down to the very close, was one of unceasing activity and progress. During the war of 1815 the number of artificers and labourers was between three and four thousand, and even its peace establishment was fifteen hundred, a number which was ultimately increased, but not to a very large extent. In 1847, when Mr. Ruegg published his \" Rambles,\" he stated that the rise of a steam navy had established the steam engine factory, which employed a thousand men and boys, and that the Dockyard was at that time \"the leading establishment of the town.\" The Crimean War.\u2014 During the war with Russia in 1854-5, the place was again abnormally active, there being employed no fewer than eleven hundred and fifty shipwrights and seven hundred engineers, irrespective of other artisans and labourers, probably in all nearly three"], [435, "WOOLWICH. 289 thousand, but the number fell off again when peace was restored, and m 1865 we find the following to have been the full strength :\u2014 Established shipwrights, 440, with 50 apprentices and 150 hired men \u2022 caulkers 29, and 10 apprentices ; joiners, 68, with 3 apprentices and 68 hired \u25a0 smiths 10l' 3 apprentices and 115 hired ; millwrights, 5, and 18 hired ; sawyers, 22 at the' pits' and 20 at the sawmills ; riggers, 48 ; sailmakers, 14 ; and labourers, 520.

Warnings and forebodings had indeed been heard, but they were only of the customary kind, and nobody heeded them' For at least twenty years the Dockyard had been told that it was to be extinguished, un til the cry of \" Wolf ! \" only provoked a smile, and the old \" Yard \" reposed in fancied security until the day of its death. But the end came in 1869, and the bell rang tbe workmen out for the last time on September 18th. The Thalia, the last ship built here, was launched on the 13th of Woolwich Dockyard Gates closed, September 18th, 1869. July previous. Most of the machinery and some of the buildings were removed to Chatham, where two of the great structures which once sheltered the ships in progress at this dockyard are to be seen to-day labelled \"The Woolwich Sheds.\" Deptford Dockyard and some smaller establishments were closed at the same time. Who Closed the Dockyard ? \u2014 Who closed Woolwich Dockyard ? is a question that has been asked of politicians hereabout more often than any other, and has never been satisfactorily answered. Both the great political parties have been accused of this crime, and neither has been able permanently to blacken the other with it, for the reason that both are equally involved. But it is to some extent gratifying to find that I am able to relieve"], [436, "290 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. both Whig and Tory of the primary and principal responsibility which attaches to this iconoclastic and ruinous proceeding, and place it upon the proper head. This is the head of someone hitherto unsuspected, \u2014 the head of the celebrated engineer, Mr. Rennie. Mr. Rennie. \u2014 In 1803, when there were threats of invasion, Rennie was consulted by the Government on the subject of improving the dockyards, which were being outstripped by private enterprise, and he made a report in which he recommended that Deptford Dockyard should be retained, but not as a building yard, and Woolwich Dockyard abolished. Woolwich, he said, was too high up tbe river, the water was shallow, and the place was incapable of enlargement to tbe required extent except at enormous cost. Large ships, even if built there, must go down tbe stream into deeper water, before they could take in guns, stores, and provisions. Chatham, it should be noted, was also condemned by Mr. Rennie, as incapable of being adapted to the national requirements ; but the authorities, though they have taken his advice as to Woolwich and Deptford, have gone in the opposite course with respect to Chatham. Rennie's leading idea was a magnificent new dock at Northfleet. Woolwich Dockyard was not closed until sixty-six years after this, but tbe great engineer's report was ever before the Admiralty, and at last both Conservative and Liberal concurred in tbe doom of the mother dock, whose final knell I stood at the gate to hear as the last of the workmen were \" rung out \" on the 18th of September, 1869. The expediency of abolishing the river yards and enlarging the remaining establishments was discussed in the House of Commons in 1868. It was then thought advisable to retain Deptford for victualling purposes, and to get rid of Woolwich altogether as soon as the extensions at Chatham were completed. Tbe first Lord of tbe Admiralty, Mr. Cbilders, in his speech on the Navy Estimates, Sth March, 1869, said, painful as it might be to close Woolwich Dockyard on lst October following, as affecting the interests of so large a town, the only question was, \"Is Woolwich Dockyard required or not? \" and the only answer is that, \" It is not required.\" He said that Deptford should be kept as a storeyard, which was necessary on the Thames. Ruin and Migration. \u2014 The closing of the Dockyard had been just preceded by extensive reductions in the Royal Arsenal, by the removal of the clothing stores to Pimlico, and by the abolition of the Woolwich Division of Royal Marines. If the accumulation of disasters had been deliberately planned to ruin the town it could hardly have been more complete. Terrible distress prevailed amongst the families of the workpeople, and owners of houses in the Dockyard district suffered"], [437, "PLATE XXXI Woolwich Emigrants embarking for Canada, 1869. sTo face page 290.]"], [438, ""], [439, "291 WOOLWICH. heavy losses. A relief fund was set on foot, and realised \u00a33,000, by which means eighteen hundred emigrants were sent to Canada in the winter of 1868-9, and five hundred more in the sprino- of 1870. The Fate of the Old Yard. \u2014 When the Dockyard was abolished the site was handed over to the War Office, and the only noteworthy naval work since done therein was in 1876, when the easternmost dock was lengthened about twenty feet to receive tbe Indepcndencia, Bra zilian ironclad, since purchased and added to the English navy as the Neptune. The whole place now consists of a few workshops and a number of supplementary stores under the charge of tbe Ordnance Department Woolwich Dockyard during the Great Storm of January 18th, 1881. at the Royal Arsenal. A wharf at the eastern end 100 feet long was given to the parish, and the mast pond and buildings adjacent, together with a small part of the east frontage, were sold. The Great Storm.\u2014 The illustration here given perpetuates the remarkable storm of January 18th, 1881, when the snow fell three feet deep in the streets of Woolwich, and the tide rose eight inches higher at the Dockyard than was ever before known. Lifeboats. \u2014 The Dockyard and the town of Woolwich are entitled to a goodly share in the history of tbe Lifeboat Institution. Captain Washington, hydrographer to the Royal Navy, was the fidus achates of Algernon, Duke of Northumberland, the great resuscitator of the"], [440, "292 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. lifeboat enterprise ; and it was in Washington's house in Wood Street (afterwards occupied by the late Admiral Robertson) that the plans were drawn and discussed. It was in Woolwich Dockyard, soon after the Exhibition of 1851, that the first boat on the improved plan was tried in the presence of the Duke aforesaid, Sir Edward Perrott, and other friends of the Institution ; and it was at Woolwich Dockyard gates that tbe lifeboat carriage was found to be scientifically constructed too wide to pass through, in consequence of which tbe whole concern had to be floated down the river to the Royal Arsenal. At that time there were not a dozen lifeboats round the coast, where now they are counted by hundreds. Dockyard Accidents. \u2014 The career of Woolwich Dockyard, minus its own collapse, bas been remarkably free from disasters. The most serious accident we have on the records was a singular explosion, which is thus described : \u2014 On Dec. 30th, 1812, in the afternoon, a machine used in Mr. Lukin's drying-house at Woolwich, for the purpose of bending and seasoning timber, unfortunately burst, in consequence of being over-charged, by which eight individuals lost their lives, and fourteen were dangerously hurt, several having their legs and thighs broken. The premises on which the machine stood were destroyed by the explosion, which is represented as having been most terrific. Several of the men left large families.

Drawn by Paul Sandby in 1773. CHAPTER XXV. ANCESTRY OF THE ROYAL ARSENAL Through the gloom of ages, it is not easy to discern tbe origin of tbe Royal Arsenal, and legendary mist has lent superfluous aid to obscurity ; but, by diligence and patience, we may, at least partly, penetrate the darkness, and see, perchance, the light. How it was not Created. \u2014 It is unnecessary any longer to refute the romantic story which for so many years found acceptance as the true narrative of the events which led to the establishment of the national works at Woolwich. It is now so thoroughly disproved and discredited that it may be with safety repeated as one of tbe legends of tbe place without fear of its imposing upon anyone. The story is that Mr. Schalch, who for many years held the office of Master Founder at Woolwich, obtained his appointment by predicting an explosion which was caused by a damp mould at the casting of a great gun at Moor fields in 171(5, at which seventeen persons were killed and many others injured, amongst the latter being General Borgard, first Com mandant of Woolwich. Source of the Error. \u2014 This tradition, which was destroyed by Lieutenant (now Colonel) Gr. E. Grover, R.E., in a paper addressed to the Royal Artillery Institution, about the year 1874, appears in the book known as \"Beauties of England and Wales,\" published in 1806, and the writer says that he derived his information partly from \" Vestiges"], [447, "WOOLWICH. 297 Collected and Recollected,\" * by J. Moser, Esq., who was collaterally related to Schalch, and partly from a conversation with L. Gaschlin,t Dr. Hutton, t and other officers belonging to the establishments at Woolwich. In Embryo. \u2014 But while we know the Schalch theory to be a delusion, we have no other authority whatever in tbe shape of document or record of any kind to show us when the Arsenal actually came into being. We see that the site upon which it stands was in tbe early days a half wild, and, in the very early days, an unenclosed, spot, inhabited chiefly by rabbits, and known as \" The Warren,\" \u00a7 and of those early days we can learn little else. But there are evidences, nevertheless \u2014 positive and substantial, as well as circumstantial evi dences \u2014 to prove that the beginning of the Government works at this spot is just as ancient as, if not more ancient than, the first inception of their sister establishment, the Dockyard, which we have succeeded in tracing as far back as 1512. Date of Birth. \u2014 Common rumour, through the mouth of Moser and others, assigned its birth, as we have said, to 1716, but Grover conjectured an existence dating back to 1667. It will probably appear from these records that it came into existence, at least in the bud, fully a century earlier. Grover fixes upon 1667 because in that year Prince Rupert was ordered by the King || to raise works and batteries at Wool wich, and build in tbe Warren a platform with sixty guns upon it as a defence against the Dutch. This parapet is shown on the interesting plan prepared by General Borgard in 1701,1! and a footpath along the river bank is described in several later maps as \" Prince Rupert's Walk.\" But I think there is sufficient warrant for concluding that the Warren was acquired and fortified by the nation long before Prince Rupert made his appearance at Woolwich. I propose to submit my evidence. A Venerable Witness. \u2014 In the King's Library is preserved a skin of vellum on which is drawn in colours a plan of the Thames as it appeared in 1588, this having been prepared to show Queen Elizabeth the nature of the defences provided for the resistance of the \" In- * European Magazine, 1802. t Lewis Gaachlin was Schalch's nephew, and assisted him for many years. When more than eighty years of age he was still employed at the Warren as principal modeller. J Dr. Hutton, the celebrated mathematician, was Professor of Mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, at that time part of the Warren. \u00a7 In 1717, Harris, in his History of Kent, says, \" On the Warren, or as it is now called ' Woolwich Green,' the officers of the Ordnance usually prove and try their new-cast guns,\" and a picture of the Warren, dated 1739, has the following des cription : \"This place is called 'The Warren,' and by some 'Woolwich Green.'\" || Charles II. IT Plate XXXIII."], [448, "298 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. vincible Armada \" if it should, in pursuance of the Spanish boast, dare to ascend tbe river. From this plan I have copied the portion which embraces Woolwich and the reaches of the Thames from Greenwich to Erith. It is on a very small scale, and the artist's colouring is a little confusing, further than which its great age must be taken into account. Old Plan of Thames, showing Woolwich in time of Queen Elizabeth, 1588. Woolwich Church. \u2014 It will be seen that the drawing represents Woolwich Church with a spire,* and delineates a battery of seven (?) guns either on Market Hill or at the Warren, showing their ranges up and down the stream. There are similar batteries shown in the original at Erith, Greenhithe, and Gravesend, and barriers of gunboats are moored across tbe river at Gravesend, as they are here seen above Charlton. The Breaches at Plumstead. \u2014 While we have this plan before us, it is well to note the great breach in tbe river wall at Crossness, the little breach at Trip Cot (which was a building on the bank), and the breaches on tbe northern side of tbe river, where also was a house which seems to have given its name to Gallions Reach. The point called \" Magott Nesse\" is now corrupted into \"Margaret's,\" and Tripcot is generally written \" Tripcock.\" \" Podde's Elms \" have disappeared, and tbe reach which bore their name has now no title more chaste than that of \" Bugsby's Hole.\" I may remark that the Dockyards of Woolwich and Deptford are unseen on this plan, though no especial inference is due to the circumstance, as each would have consisted merely of a sunken building slip, with no erections worth showing on so crude an elevation as this is. * The enlargement in the right-hand lower corner shows this earliest view of Woolwich as it appears under the microscope. I do not conclude from this that the church had a pointed spire, the old draughtsmen being accustomed to use that sign indiscriminately for all churches."], [449, "WOOLWICH. 299 The Tower at Woolwich.\u2014 But, to reach the question now at issue, I would point out that the plan brings to our view, in addition to the church, two distinct spires or columns at the eastern end of the town. The smaller represents tbe turret of the Ropeyard, erected, as we shall presently see, in 1573-6; tbe other can be hardly anything else than the tower which has hitherto been known as \" Rupert's.\" If this be granted, then it is proved that the Tower Place existed in the reign of Elizabeth, and to establish the fact beyond question, we have an important piece of documentary proof. Sir Martin Bowes,* who was the wealthy man of Woolwich in the time of Henry VIII, and Lord Mayor of London in 1545, is shown by a deed still in existence to have owned \" the Tower in Woolwich,\" and the same (described as a \" capi tal messuage \"t) was sold by his son on the 14th of April, 156S, which was after his father's death, to John Peers and Alice his wife. The \" Tower Place,\" as it was then called, came soon afterwards into the occupation of the BarnesJ family, and, Sir William Barnes beino- a Crown official, it was probably at this time that the property passed into the hands of tbe Government. What was it ? \u2014 From these circumstances it would appear that the Tower Place was originally a family mansion, having close beside, but quite detached, a high, substantial, hexagonal column. It is diffi cult to assign tbe motive of tbe builder in providing this lofty pillar as an appendix to his dwelling-place. Possibly it ma}* have been raised merely for its ornamental aspect, or for the view to be gained from it ; or it may have been intended for a scientific observatory, or a shot tower. There is, however, a real presentment of the edifice to be seen in a large and admirable model at tbe United Service Institution, by which we may study its purpose at leisure ; and there are several excellent drawings extant, one of which, from the accurate band of Paul Sandby, I reproduce at the head of this chapter. I have come to tbe conclusion that it was not merely one of those towers for casting shot such as we see in tbe vicinity of Southwark, for tbe model just mentioned shows that it had five floors, with staircases from floor to floor \u2014 an arrangement which was evidently part of the original structure, and inconsistent with the shot-making hypothesis. I think the most feasible supposition I can offer is that the tower was one of those look-out posts which were planted at various parts of tbe Thames for the protection of the royal palace at Greenwich and the city of London. \u00a7 It was finally pulled * See various records as per Index. t Messuage : dwelling-house and grounds. X See various records as per Index. \u00a7 For instance, it is stated in the chronicles of the city that in 1380, John Phelip pot, late Mayor of London, undertook, at his own cost, to build a tower on the banks of the Thames, \" sixty king's feet in height,\" to protect the shipping and the city from hostile attacks and alarm, and the city undertook the building of a second tower."], [450, "300 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. down more than a hundred years ago, having probably become decrepit and unsafe. The date of demolition was August, 1786. The mansion, not the tower, is said to have been rebuilt by Sir John Vanbruo-h in 1719, as we now see it, for it is the present Pattern Room of the Roval Laboratory ; but tbe foundations and lower walls may be pronounced remnants of the ancient fabric, seeing that they are in places six and seven feet thick, a circumstance which we cannot recon cile with the necessities of the Tudor age. Supposing that it has been rebuilt, we can only guess at the appearance and character of the ancient and original mansion ; but it probably resembled other old and half-fortified domiciles which are still to be met with, such an one as Spenser describes \u2014 A stately palace built of brick, Whose walls were high and strong and thick. High lifted up with lofty towers, Full of fair windows and delightful bowers, And on the top, a dial told the hours. The Germ of the Arsenal. \u2014 The building bears to this day in many of its apartments, especially on the upper floors, strong evidences of its residential character, but, judged by its outward appearance, even in its present shape, its origin and purpose may well be conceived to have been, in some measure, defensive. It is undoubtedly entitled to our respect as the oldest and most important structure in or near Woolwich, and also, I believe, as the very germ of our great Arsenal. What it has been. \u2014 The Tower House has been put to many uses and bas various periods of history. Conceiving the object of its tower to have been defensive, and judging by relative circumstances, it may be thought to have dated from the time of Edward III. or Richard II. (1327-99), and to give tbe spot a militant connection of five centuries. Until about 1570, however, the house was but a private residence, and after it passed into tbe bands of the Government it remained for several generations tbe dwelling-place of successive Masters General of the Ord nance. It was tbe first home of the Royal Artillery, and it became tbe birthplace of the Royal Military Academy. As an early museum of curiosities it was once on the verge of destruction by fire, but it bas now risen again to be an exhibition of warlike wonders more strange and vast than anything which its older occupants could have dreamt of. We may not know, then, the positive inception of the Roval Arsenal. Like the little negress, it may perhaps be said to have \" growed \" rather than to have been born ; but I can have no doubt that around this nucleus have been gathered all the storehouses, barracks, and factories which have in the course of the last three hundred years built up the"], [451, "WOOLWICH, 301 garrison town of Woolwich. Palace or castle, the Tower House was the father of the Royal Arsenal. Woolwich Ropeyard. \u2014 Possibly in searching out the age of the Royal Arsenal, we may find some collateral testimony in the records of the Ropeyard. To most of those who now inhabit Woolwich, the Ropeyard is a mere tradition. And yet, for near three centuries, the Ropehouse was one of the most important hives of industry in the locality. Origin. \u2014 The Ropehouse was erected in 1573-6* (in the reign of Elizabeth) to supply cordage to tbe navy. Tbe builder was Thomas Allen, \"the Queen's merchant,\" who, in the year 1579, we find in pos session of a leases of the place, then described as \" tbe long workhouse,\" and certain grounds in Woolwich adjoining the land of Dr. Gilbourne.J A plan of the rope ground shows that it consisted of a single ropewalk and a double ropewalk, a large storehouse, a tar-kettle house, old and new tar-cellars, and houses for tbe Master Ropemaker and Clerk of the Ropeyard. There were also several watch-cabins outside the walls to shelter the night watchmen. (Plate XXVI.) The State papers of Elizabeth (1572) contain a detailed estimate for \" building the Ropehouse at Wollwiche.\" Allen received \u00a3800 towards the cost of \" buildings needful for making great cables and other cordage for the use of the navy,\" and was to be reimbursed if the cost exceeded that sum. He was bound to plans and to pay \u00a3100 a year rent for the ground and houses within one year after tbe bouses were built, or 5 per cent, on the money actually expended.

We have a letter from the Ordnance officers at Woolwich (April 16, 1663) urging tbe need of repairs to the Gun Wharf, which they point out is also \" used for rope,\" and asking for timber to repair it; and there is a complaint from William Bodham, clerk and principal of the Ropeyard (August 3, 1664) showing the decayed state of \" the wharf in the Ropeyard where the crane stands.\" It is almost certain that tbe wharf referred to in both these cases is the same, and it requires very little effort to connect it with \" the storehouse by the water\" built by Allen in 1572. Therefore we trace the wharf and crane of the Ropewalk and the Gun Wharf of the Ordnance officers to the adjacent bank of tbe river, east of Warren Lane, and conclude with some certainty that the said wharf must have been that which forms the extremity of the Royal Laboratory.* Consequently we may decide that the rudimentary Arsenal and the Ropewalk existed together from the earlier part of Elizabeth's reign ; and, if there is any doubt in fixing this period for its origin, I should say that it is in favour of according to the embryo factory a line of antiquity remoter still. Stepping back One Hundred Years. \u2014 However, taking the dates as clearly fixed (viz., 1545, for the existence in private hands of the Tower House, 1570 or thereabouts for its first occupation by a Government officer, 1572 for the building of tbe Ropehouse, and various other references which show that the Ropehouse and the wharf were one), we may fairly claim to have succeeded in carrying back the records of the Royal Arsenal a century beyond the period for which it has yet had credit. A Naval Descent. \u2014 For a hundred years or so tbe Ropehouse and the Warren were under one head, and that head the Board of Admiralty, or Navy Commissioners. We may, therefore, in continuing the narrative, follow for a time the records of one as the records of both, the greater including the less, and the greater being the Ropeyard. The Stuart Kings. \u2014 Elizabeth's successor, James I., being devoted to his ships, looked well after his Ropeyard, which was the principal one in the kingdom and meet companion to tbe Mother Dockyard. There are saved from the lumber of James's reign three certificates of the year 1621, signed by Richard Chester, John King, Joshua Downing and others, showing the excellence of the cordage in his Majesty's Ropeyard; but the rule of Charles I., as may be imagined, was as disastrous here as it was at the sister establishment, though the * Pepys, Secretary to the Admiralty, who frequently visited the Ropeyard, speaks in his diary (Aug. 23rd, 1663) of embarking at the Tower Gates, referring apparently to the steps adjacent to the Tower Place. u2"], [456, "304 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Ropeyard has not always followed the fortunes of the Dockyard, for we sometimes find the one in a flourishing state while the other lan guished. Both, however, were at a low ebb under tbe feeble adminis tration of the martyr-king. The Conquest of India. \u2014 The chronicles of the Dockyard have already shown that the East India Company went out with its expedi tions for commerce and for conquest with its ships equipped at Wool wich, and the archives of the company show us that much of its good fortune sprang from hence. The possession of India, that resplendent jewel in the crown of England, is therefore distinctly connected with the records of Woolwich. The East India Company established at Woolwich.\u2014 Charles was able to spare his dockyard entirely to the company for a short time in 1628, for we read that in February of that year \" tbe use of Woolwich Dockyard was granted to the East India Company for fourteen days for the repair of two of their ships, and grounding another for inspection,\" and the company's affection for the town ripened to such an extent that in a few years afterwards they proposed to take tbe Ropeyard wholly into their keeping. There is a report from the officers ofthe navy dated May 24th, 1633, showing that they had been in treaty with the East India Company about his Majesty's Rope house at Woolwich, to be let to them for three years, the company agreeing to pay \u00a3100 a year and build a brick wall about the yard. The report speaks favourably of the proposal, and, in a charter of June 5th in the same year, His Majesty makes acquiescence, saying that he is \" well content that the Ropehouse be let to the East India Company.\" On June llth Sir William Russell writes with satisfaction at the pros pect, seeing that all things at the Ropeyard are \" exceedingly ruinated and purlioned away, to tbe king's prejudice,\" and the transfer was finally concluded by tho Council on June 22nd. The brick wall was built in 1634,* but, for some reason unexplained, the three years ten ancy did not run out, for it appears that on July 14th, 1635, an Admi ralty order was passed to \" receive again the Ropehouse at Woolwich, formerly lent to the East India Company.\" While the place was in the Company's occupation we hear complaints, such as might be expected, of alien labour supplanting the natives, for the company brought their own officers and probably their own workmen with them. There is a petition dated October 31st, 1633, addressed to Secretary Coke, from Thomas Argoll, clerk (and principal) of the Ropeyard, setting * A State paper of Charles I.

The Civil War. \u2014 It was about this time that Charles I. made that levy for the improvement of the navy which brought such trouble to the country and to himself; but Woolwich, which has prospered through many misfortunes, began once more to look up. The Ropeyard was started again as a Government establishment on a larger scale and with plenty of lucrative employment. In 1642 the civil war broke out, and for the five years in which it raged Woolwich seems to have been left in undisturbed peace and unmolested industry. The Protector. \u2014 Neither did the advent of the Commonwealth impair our good luck. Quite the contrary : Cromwell's republicanism bore early fruit in an order of October, 1649, increasing the wages of the Woolwich ropemakers all round on condition that \" they spin nineteen threads per day, the whole length of the Ropeyard, the same to weigh 77 lbs. ; \" the spinners also having their pay raised from eighteen pence to twenty pence per day, the hatcbelors * from sixteen pence to seven teen pence, the winders from fifteen pence to sixteen pence, and the labourers from fourteen pence to fifteen pence. The impulse given to commerce and naval enterprise under the Protectorate is well known and undeniable. We have already seen its effect upon this station, and there is every reason to suppose that the Ropewalk was no exception to the rule of activity which prevailed at this time in all things connected with the national service. We may, indeed, through all our annals, read with tolerable accuracy the history of England in the records of Woolwich. Consequently, we must not expect such a satisfactory report from the reign of Charles II. Charles II. \u2014 Indeed, the period of the \"Merrie Monarch\" was a miserable time for the ropemakers, for work was scarce, and money scarcer. The men were always begging to be paid their arrears of wages, and some of their petitions are most pitiful. In 1657, they pleaded that they were six months behind, and \" greatly prejudiced by running scores with merciless chandlers and mealmen.\" But things got worse rather than better, and when the arrears grew to nine months, instead of asking the King to pay up, they seem to have succeeded better by suggesting that he should increase their wages to 2s. 3d. per day, \" like the ropemakers of London.\" * Hatchelors = flax-beaters."], [458, "306 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT.

The Plague. \u2014 The following must supplement the diarist's other allusions to the plague at Woolwich, already referred to : \u2014 1633. Aug. 12th. \u2014 The people die so fast, and this day W. Badhani tells me there is one dead at Woolwich, not far from the Ropehouse. God preserve us. A Clerkly Ropemaker. \u2014 Mr. Bodham, clerk of the Ropehouse, was an energetic officer and an industrious correspondent. There are many letters from him in existence, mostly on dry matters of business, but lightened here and there by strange conceits. Here is an Admiralty minute, which throws a slur upon his orthodoxy : \u2014 1664. Feb. 21st. \u2014 William Bodham reports a fire at the George alehouse near the Ropeyard, caused by the keeper entertaining some ropemakers and suffering them to be drunk. He has turned this man [presumably a ropemaker] out of the works, and recommends a certain honest fellow in his stead, but, being one whose private opinions suffer him not to go to church, is doubtful whether he may be entered. Cheats in the Ropewalk. \u2014 So conscientious a subject must have been greatly annoyed by the discovery which was made in this same year (August 17th, 1664), that the weights at the Ropeyard were too light, and that the Government bad thereby been defrauded of \u00a3500 in four years \u2014 a demonstration of tbe same official morality which had raised the suspicions of Pepys in 1661. At this time (1664) the Dutch war made the ropemakers busy again, and they were spinning two tons per day. Peculation seemed to flourish in proportion to the labour"], [459, "WOOLWICH. 307 done, although the yard was surrounded by watch-boxes, and although as many as thirteen persons were sent to Maidstone for trial in 1663 for stealing one piece of cable. Such trifles, however, did not disturb honest Mr. Bodham, nor impair his cheerful humour. Ten days after the exposure of the false weights (April 27th, 1664) he wrote a letter to the Government, suggesting, in his simplicity, that if a small belfry or turret were erected on his dwelling-house, he would pay for a clock for the yard himself. Bodham's residence must have been distinct from the main building, or the turret must have been temporarily absent, for in all the illus trations which we have of the place, before and after this date, the tur ret is clearly shown.* A Strike. \u2014 In the midst of the war time there was a strike among the ropemakers, but it only lasted five days, and we are not told its cause or purpose. Bodham simply reports (October 25th, 1665) that the whole of the refractory workmen who were away from the Ropeyard from the 13th to the 18th have returned peaceably and continued their employment. The powers of our managing clerk as a complete letter-writer were usefully employed in 1667 on behalf of Widow Lacy, who, having suc ceeded her husband in a department of the Ropeyard where the \" twice laid stuff \" was prepared, was forced to resign her appointment in conse quence of her son flying for debt, and Bodham urgently appealed to the Admiralty for payment of \u00a350 due to her on three bills, as she was \" without wood or coals to lay on the fire, and her indigent creditors are in as bad a case.\" William III. \u2014 King William III. had the Ropeyard extended on his arrival in 1688 at a cost of \u00a34,345, making its total length 1061 feet. In the survey of harbours made in 1698, it is stated that the value of the place before the Revolution (1688) was \u00a34,508, and after the altera tions, \u00a38,854. In the seventeenth year of George II. (1744) an Act of Parliament was passed to purchase an acre and a quarter of orchard ground near the Ropeyard from Mr. Edward Bowater. Another Strike. \u2014 This was war-time again, for the Pretender was in the field, and we had another strike. There were about four hun dred ropemakers employed in the yard, and the demand for skilled \u2022workmen was great. But the ropemakers refused to take apprentices, a proceeding which displeased the King so much that he sent out his press-gangs, seized eight of the protectionist mechanics, and had them taken away to the ships at the Nore to make them serve as sailors. * An official description of 1739 says, \" The Ropery has a turret and bell.\""], [460, "308 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Thereupon the whole of the remaining ropemakers struck work and volunteered for the navy ; and as the King could not do without his cables and cordage, he had to give way and send the eight pressed men back to their victorious companions. Labour Lost.- \u2014 Peace, however, lowered the pride of the haughty artisans, and they did not have another such opportunity, Royal Rope yards being established elsewhere and the labour distributed. In 1756, when we were at war with France, there were but twenty spinners and seven labourers in Woolwich Ropeyard, although it was reported that, having three spinning-wheels ready, the place could accommodate seventy men and spin a ton a day. Again, in 1774, in the midst of the terrible conflict which lost America, there were only a hundred and forty men, all told, in the Ropery ; and yet Hasted tells us, a few years later (in 1777), that it was here tbe biggest cables were still made for the men-of-war, some of them being twenty-seven inches in circumfer ence and two hundred and sixty yards long. But the establishment never regained the high position from which its four hundred monopo lists precipitated it in the time of George II. At its full size the enclosure was 1080 feet in length and in the shape of a parallelogram, as may be seen from Barker's plan on page 40. The buildings at the eastern end were three stories high. Fires. \u2014 The whole place was in peril of destruction by fire on two or three occasions, being built mainly of wood, and often heated for manufacturing purposes to a high degree. In 1759, by the boiling over of a tar-kettle, a considerable portion of the main building was de stroyed, and on tbe 8th of July, 1813, another still more disastrous fire entirely consumed the white hemp-house. On this occasion, the fire, which was supposed to have been incendiary, broke out between seven and eight in the morning and burned until ten, creating vast excite ment in tbe town and threatening the Royal Arsenal. The drums were beat to call out the military, and a thousand artillerymen were employed in extinguishing tbe fire. Finis. \u2014 The period of decay was prolonged until 1835, when the old buildings were finally condemned and sold, the site being pur chased by Mr. George Smith, of Woolwich. The church and schools of Holy Trinity, and the houses on both sides of Beresford Street, were built upon the ground prior to 1843.* The old materials were mostly employed in erecting the new houses, but the foundation walls were left undisturbed, and are unearthed whenever the excavators are at work upon the sewers, gas-mains, or water-pipes. These buried relics run the whole length of Beresford Street near tbe southern side. * See illustration, page 171."], [461, "The Royal Foundry and Rookery in 1779 (Sandby's original drawing] CHAPTER XXVI. INFANCY OF THE ROYAL ARSENAL Woolwich Warren or Green. \u2014 Having followed the fortunes of the Ropery, which was almost unquestionably the progenitor of the Royal Arsenal, and attended its mournful decease, we must go back to tbe infancy of its offspring. Woolwich Warren, or Woolwich Green, extended from the border of the old town at Warren Lane until it merged in the swamp or \"salt ings \" of the Plumstead Marsh. The ancient embankment of the river ceased along the whole front of it, the gravel bed of which the soil mainly consists having raised the surface sufficiently above the prevailing level of the river shore to save it from the tides ; but a copious stream ran through it from the hills, covering with pools and reed-beds the low grounds to the east, while the sandy knolls on the town side were clothed with a coarse growth of turf and bramble, and burrowed through and through by colonies of rabbits. Hence its name, the Warren. It was unenclosed \u2014 an open, uncultured, worthless waste. But at length the growth of the town and the favouring site, on the"], [462, "310 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. edge of a vast and bright and beautiful river, teeming with fish, and convenient for communication with tbe cities of London and Westmin ster, attracted to the spot some wealthy citizen, and here he built, close to Warren Lane, the great Tower House. This dwelling-place was the seed of the Royal Arsenal. Tower Place. \u2014 The mansion stood a hundred yards or so from the river, on solid ground ; but it was here that the elevation upon which Woolwich grew began to disappear, and the soil by the waterside assumed the soddened boggy character of the neighbouring marsh. Hence, as tbe Crown had need of it, and as other buildings arose, it became requisite to carry the drains through the peaty earth upon deep foundation walls of brick,* and by the mere landing-stage provided for the accommodation of the folks at Tower Place, walls and wharves were built, little by little, until the whole frontage of the old Warren was breasted in, redeemed from the waste and quagmire, and added to tbe dry ground. Such was the infancy of the Royal Arsenal. Early Ordnance Departments. \u2014 The theory herein formulated is sufficiently justified by the records of the preceding chapter, but these may be reinforced by some others bearing more directly upon this section of our subject. All that we have hitherto seen of the primitive establishments at Woolwich are of a naval character, but we may also learn that the Ordnance departments were supplied from hence even at the early times when not only were the army and navy much commingled, but gunners, pikemen, archers, and musqueteers were all employed together in the composition of the British forces. In 1585, which was the twenty-seventh year of Elizabeth, ber Majesty found it necessary to repair her storehouses, as witness tbe following specification : \u2014 An estimate for the office of Thordinauncet for the seas needeful to be taken in hande, as also newe buylding and other reparacions to be done at her highnes store house of Thordenaunce at Woolwich, viz. : reparacions to the crane at a house for Th ordinaunce workmen at Woolwich; . . . the wharfes there to be repaired ; ... the pailinge to be repaired.

The armoury, storehouse, and workshop of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth was by the Thames at Woolwich, under the shadow of the Tower House, from 1572.

He was educated for the army, and on the commencement of the rebellion, which happened when he was scarcely of age, he offered his services to his uncle, Charles I. Throughout the whole war he behaved with great intrepidity. King Charles made him a Knight of the Garter, and a free denizen, and advanced him to the dignity of a peer of England, by tbe title of Earl of Holdernesse and Duke of Cumberland. When the civil war was over Rupert went abroad with a pass from the Parliament, but after the Restoration he was invited to return to England, and had several offices conferred upon him.

He also acquainted them with an engine he had contrived for raising water, and sent them an instrument for casting any platform into perspective. He was like wise the inventor of a gun for discharging several bullets with the utmost speed, facility, and safety ;' and the Royal Society received from him the intimation of a certain method of blowing up rocks in mines and other subterraneous places.

As a soldier he was brave but rash, and some of the reverses suffered by his uncle (Charles I.) have been attributed to his hasty and unguarded tactics. Prince Rupert's Warrant. \u2014 It was after the restoration of the monarchy that Prince Rupert was employed by his cousin, Charles II. , to construct batteries at Woolwich for the resistance of the threatened Dutch invasion. The King's warrant is dated June 13th, 1667, and is addressed, \" to our dearest cousin, Prince Rupert, Comte Palatine of ye Rhine and Duke of Cumberland.\" It begins \u2014 Most Dere Cousin. Wee greet you well. Wheras wee have appointed eertaine works and batterys to be forthwith raised at or neare Woolwich for ye better security of ye river against ye attempt of ye enemy in this conjuncture of affairs, &c. Fortifying1 the Warren. \u2014 The Prince is accordingly requested to undertake the work, and persons of all ranks are charged to obey his orders. Soon we learn that on the 28th of June, 1667, one Roger Wiggen received \u00a3200 from Sir Stephen Fox, which he immediately carried to Woolwich, and delivered into the hands of Prince Rupert, and that in a very short time after a platform or battery was built for sixty guns. Reference may now be made to General Borgard's plan of 1701,* which, in the opinion of Grover, shows a parapet along the river wall, thirteen feet thick and pierced with forty embrasures at central intervals of eighteen feet, there being room for at least twenty more guns on the parapet if required, It also shows, in rear of the parapet, \"Prince Rupert's Walk ; \" and, in rear of that, a wet ditch surrounding what appears to have originally been a triangular demi-bastioned work, such as were common in England towards the middle of the seventeenth century. Rupert's defences were unquestionably at the Warren, and there Borgard found them, or their remains, thirty-four years later. * Plate XXXIII."], [466, "314 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Duration of the Defences. \u2014 It should be pointed out, however, that the timber which was lent by tbe Admiralty to the Office of Ordnance for this purpose was redemanded at the close of the war, and that, as will be seen in the chronicles of the Dockyard, it was duly returned. We must consequently suppose either that the batteries remained without the timber, or that they were demolished and rebuilt by Borgard, who certainly did construct new defences at this place. I prefer to believe with Grover that tbe batteries remained, and Prince Rupert's Walk, shown in the rear of the works, strengthens the idea.* A Sickly Spot. \u2014 The greater portion of the Arsenal nearest the river was, even at this time, a mere morass and desert, and the locality was very unhealthy, so that many officers and men employed upon the batteries were taken ill, and some of them died. The old difficulty connected with supplies still prevailed, and we may honestly suspect that the troops were ill-provisioned, for the national exchequer was just then quite empty, and King Charles II. was glad to borrow a special \u00a310,000 from the City of London for tbe defence of the Thames. His fleet had been crippled by poverty, recklessness, and incompetence, and all the disgrace and disaster and misery which befell England in the seventeenth century wars may be set down to the waste of their noble inheritance by the hapless Stuarts. The fearful hate engendered in the internecine war between Charles I. and his people, is illustrated by Lord Macaulay in the following verses, which form part of a composition on the Battle of Naseby, June 14th, 1645, written by Obadiah Bind-their-kings-in chains-and-their-nobles-with-fetters-of-iron, Sergeant of Ireton's Regi ment : \u2014 It was about the noon of a glorious day of June, That we saw their banners dance and their cuirasses shine, And the Man of Blood was there, with his long essenced hair, And Astley, and Six Marmaduke, and Rupert of the Rhine. And hark]! like the roar of the billows on the shore, The cry of battle rises along their charging line ! For God ! for the Cause ! for the Church ! for the Laws ! For Charles, King of England, and Rupert of the Rhine ! The furious German comes, with his clarions and his drums, His bravoes of Alsatia, and pages of Whitehall ; They are bursting on our flanks. Grasp your pikes, close your ranks ! For Rupert never comes but to conquer or to fall. They are here ! They rush on ! We are broken ! We are gone ! Our left is borne before them like stubble on the blast. 0 Lord,tput forth Thy might ! 0 Lord, defend the right ! Stand back to back in God's name, and fight it to the last. * The name of Rupert's Walk still clung to the road at the Laboratory end as lately aa 1850, but it has at last died out. The trees opposite the Royal Gun Factory offices are a remnant of the row of elms which skirted this pleasant promenade."], [467, "WOOLWICH. 315 Their heads all stooping low, their points all in a row, Like a whirlwind on the trees, like a deluge on the dykes, Our cuirassiers have burst on the ranks of the Accurst, And at a shock have scattered the forest of his pikes. Ho ! comrades scour the plain ; and ere ye strip the slain, First give another stab to make your search secure, Then shake from sleeves and pockets their broad pieces and lockets The tokens of the wanton, the plunder of the poor. Rupert's Palace.\u2014 From Prince Rupert, we naturally turn again to the building which has so long borne his name. \" Rupert's Palace \" and \"Rupert's Tower\" have quite supplanted the more ancient and forgotten \"Tower Place,\" and it is common belief that the Prince had here, for some time, a settled abode. It is not unlikely that he may have found a temporary lodging in the Tower House, and made it his headquarters while building his fortifications ; all I can say is that we have no reliable evidence of the fact.* The tradition that Rupert resided at a river-side house near High Street is even less supported by proof or probability, but even this tradition may be true. We simply know nothing about it, and none of his biographies mention the subject. Death of Rupert. \u2014 Prince Rupert died at his house in Spring Gardens, Whitehall, on November, 29th, 1682, and was interred in Henry VII.'s chapel. After his death, his collection of pictures was sold by auction, but his jewels, which were appraised by three jewellers at \u00a320,000, were disposed of by way of lottery. The tickets were \u00a35 each, and the largest prize, a great pearl necklace, valued at \u00a38,000. The lowest prizes were valued at \u00a3100. The advertisement states that this lottery was to be \" drawn in his Majesty's presence, who is pleased to declare that he himself will see all tbe prizes put in among the blanks.\" It has been remarked by Grover, as a coincidence, that the early history of the great military arsenal of England should be associated with the name of a soldier so distinguished as Prince Rupert of Bavaria in the manufacture of war material. Beyond the achievements pre viously mentioned, the Prince is said to have invented a process of annealing cast-iron guns, and to have built a gun-boring mill, turned by water, in Hackney Marsh. Introduction of Gunnery. \u2014 We may not be permitted to know whether Prince Rupert inhabited the Tower Place ; but we are able to * In a note to the engraving by Rooker of Paul Sandby's view of this building, published in 1775 (see p. 296), it is said that, \" This famous seminary is delightfully situated in the Warren, on the banks of the Thames, where formerly stood a mansion house, the turret of which still remains, and was once inhabited by Prince Rupert.\" But Sandby may have been no better informed than we."], [468, "316 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. discover the purpose to which the building was put within six months of his death. Colonel Duncan, C.B., M.P., in preparing his \"History of the Royal Artillery,\" met with an old deed dated March, 1683, referring to this place. It sets forth that the Lieutenant-General of tbe Ordnance (who was next in rank to tbe Master- General), having to give up bis official residence in \" ye old artillerie garden situate near ye Spitle in ye parish of St. Buttolph, Bishop's Gate,\" he should be allowed tbe large manor house and grounds known as \" Tower Place at Woolwich,\" together with \" The Warren,\" but on tbe express condition that the proving of great guns go on as heretofore in Woolwich, that the Government should have full control over all wharves, magazines, cranes, &c, and that a dwelling for the Master Gunner of England* should be allowed in the said mansion house, and lodging for ten field gunners in the adjoining houses, and also for such Ordnance labourers as might be necessary. Thus did gunnery establish its home at Woolwich in 1683. The same arrangements probably continued for about eighty years, during which, as we have said, Tower Place was rebuilt, or partly rebuilt, by Vanbrugh in 1719.t The Rabbit Warren. \u2014 It is rather difficult to reconcile the fore going statement as to the tenancy of the Warren with the following extract from the Exchequer Court Rolls of 1691 : \u2014 - In the second year of William and Mary, Thomas Lindsey, Rector of Woolwich, sued Alice Wells, widow, in the Court of Exchequer, for neglecting to pay tithes, estimated at forty shillings a year, on great numbers of coneys and rabbits sold in the years 1688-89-90, from about thirty acres called \" the Warren.\" The apparent contradiction is, however, open to several solutions. The Warren may have been only leased to the Ordnance, or part of it may have remained in the occupation of widow Wells ; and yet the land attached to Tower Place in 1717 was forty-two acres. There are thirty-two acres of the Arsenal now in the parish of Woolwich, and it is possible that the thirty acres of the Warren upon which widow Wells paid tithes to Woolwich may be now in Plumstead. The Maker of Fireworks. \u2014 We have just noticed that the Master Gunner of England was to reside in the Tower Place, then described as the \" Mansion House.\" We also see his quarters men tioned as being in tbe \" Manor House,\" which probably means the same thing. He appears to have been the chief administrative officer of the early artillery, and Queen Elizabeth entrusted him by letters patent * A tablet to Captain Leake, Master Gunner of England, and Elizabeth his wife, who died 1695-6, is in Woolwich church.

New Forts.\u2014 A little later than the arrival at the Warren of these important officials, we hear again of fortifications in a letter addressed by King James II. to his daughter Mary under date of October 2nd, 1688, in which he says \u2014 I was this morning abroad to take the air, and to see some batteries I have made below Woolwich* for the defence of the river. And since I came back, I have been so very busy to prepare things for the invasion intended, that I could not write till now. Two months later, the wretched monarch fled in the night past these very batteries, and, taking to his ship in the river, escaped the country, thus ending the dynasty of the Stuart kings. The Enemy off Woolwich.\u2014 The need of defences so high up the river, even after the crisis had passed, is shown by the following extract from a newsletter dated April 13th, 1695 :\u2014 Two small French privateers, under Danish colours, coming up the river to Wool wich with some design, are taken. * Probably Rupert's works restored. REFERENCE TO PLATE XXXII. Major-General Eardley Maitland, C.B., R.A., Director-General of Ordnance Factories.\u2014 Born at 13, Devonshire Place, Brighton, December 10, 1833. His father, who served in the Royal Artillery up to 1819 and then went into the Church, was incumbent of St. James's Chapel, Brighton, for many years. Eardley Maitland was at Brighton College and at Dr. Butler's, on the Hill of St. Nicholas, the old parish church of Brighton. He was nominated for competition for the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, by his uncle, General Sir Peregrine Maitland, and, having passed, was entered in May, 1848, and obtained his commission as second lieutenant, Royal Artillery, in December, 1851. After serving at Woolwich, Landguard Fort, Guernsey, Plymouth, and Purfleet, until 1855, he embarked for Ceylon, whence he proceeded to take part in the suppression of the Indian mutiny in 1857-8. Was in the actions of Futtehpore, Aoung, Pandoo-Nuddee, Cawnpore, Oonao, Buseeratgunge, (lst and 2nd) Boorbeakechowkee, Mungarwar, and Alumbagh ; relief, defence, siege, and capture of Lucknow, actions at Selimpore and Sundeela, and operations in Oude. Received medal and three clasps, and a year's service for Lucknow. He remained in India until 1867, and was then at Malta until 1870, when he joined the Woolwich depot and commenced the special studies which led to his appointment as Assistant Superintendent of the Royal Gun Factories in 1872-7. He was then sent to Turkey, as military attach^ with a special mission to report on war material during the Russo- Turkish War, and afterwards became a member of the Siege Operations Committee, the Machine Gun Committee, and Committee on Ordnance, until 1880, when he wa3 made Superintendent of the Royal Gun Factories, which office he held until 1887 when he was selected for the post of Director-General of Ordnance Factories.

Petitioner prays that, as he has by his own industry discovered this invention never before attained unto, the House will grant him an ordinance for the making and casting of such ordnance, and that if anyone else should presume to cast any pieces after his invention without his leave, they may be forfeited to the use of the state. An ordinance to the effect desired passed the House of Lords, arid was sent to the Commons, but, though often put in mind of it by the Lords, the Commons allowed it to drop. Captain Cannon, however, has left an immortal name. Gun Carriages. \u2014 The \"old carriage yard\" shown in TBorgard's map of the Royal Arsenal* (which was drawn in 1701, and is the oldest we have), seems to have been built as early as 1664, an estimate dated July in that year having been found among the records in the Tower of London by Grover, which sets forth the necessity of making the storehouses \" wind and water-tite,\" and for \"keeping dry of ye powder-match and other provisions, and to keep ye said storehouses from falling downe and utter ruin,\" part of which work is specified as \" flooring a stoarehouse att AVoolwich to keep shipp carriages dry.\" Eurtber, on 5th October, 1680, there is an order that \"ye sheds at Woolwich along ye Proofehouse, and ye sheds for carriages there, be forthwith repaired ; \" and on 14th November, 1682, another for build ing a new shed at Woolwich, eighty feet broad and a hundred long, \" for lodging of ship carriages in ye place where ye old one is fallen down.\" That this was a workshop, and not merely a store, is shown by au order to Mr. Peach, the Storekeeper in 1683, requiring him to break up eighty-nine old carriages and take out the ironwork. In 1668 it was ordered that \"all ye gunns, carriages, and stores now at Deptford be removed to Woolwich, and from henceforth new ordnance and carriages be layd there.\" Laboratory. \u2014 Next to the Carriage Department came the Royal Laboratory, which was originally attached to the Tilt Yard at Green wich. Among* the Treasury papers is a letter dated 9th October, 1694, from the Commissioners of Ordnance to the Lords of the Treasury, stating that the powder had been removed from Greenwich House and the Labora tory, near adjoining, to Gravesend and Tilbury, and that they were in consequence obliged to build a new powder-house in some more * Plate XXXIII. x2"], [476, "320 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. convenient place, which must be ready by tbe time Admiral Russell was home from the Straits, and submitting an estimate and desiring payment of \u00a3500 weekly. The estimates were twofold : \u2014 lst. An estimate for building a new magazine for powder and a convenient wharfe for shipping and unshipping into and out of the same, as also for building a proofehouse and a dwelling-house for the Storekeeper.* 2nd. An estimate for building a laboratory in the Warren att Tower Place att Woolwich. On the 3rd of December, 1695, a warrant was issued to William Edge \u2014 To fetch gravell and raise and levell the ground at the new labouratory att Woolwich, according to agreement with Mr. Boulter. The same Mr. Boulter was employed in January, 1696, to give directions for fitting up the Laboratory. There was a \" saltpetre bouse \" at \"Woolwich in 1662, and a \" store keeper of saltpetre,\" but there is no certain evidence that explosives were prepared here at that period. In 1681 Sir \"William Warren was asked to contract for \u2014 - The making of two butts at Woolwich for the tryall of a tire-shott, preparing ot Captain Leake, Master Gunner us Engiand.t Iii 1682 \" one thousand canon and ten thousand demi-canon round shot \" were taken from \" Tower WTharfe, each side ye Traitors' Gate,\" to Woolwich. On October 4th, 1684, it was ordered that \" a wooden butt shall be built at Woolwich, according to Captain Leake's directions. The \" Greenwich Barne \" was erected at tbe Warren in 1696. There is an order in the Ordnance journals of December 19th, 1695, for taking down the \" barne \" in Greenwich Tilt Yard and re-erecting it at Woolwich. It was pulled down again in 1716 to make room for the gun foundry, which is now the Laboratory brass foundry. Borgard's plan of the Warren. \u2014 These dates bring us within reach of 1701 and tbe plan of General Borgard,+ which speaks for itself. I would simply direct attention to the \" Greenwich Barne,\" just mentioned, near the site of our original gun foundry, to the \"Firework * Until 1759, when Purfleet was established, the principal Government powder magazine was at Greenwich, and the inhabitants frequently complained of the danger of keeping so large a store as six thousand barrels within a quarter of a mile of their town ; \u00a315,000 was voted for the transfer to Purfleet. + Captain Leake, as we have just seen, resided at the Tower Place, in Woolwich Warren.

The \"Greenwich Barne\" aforesaid seems to have been the original Laboratory, before it was removed from the Tilt Yard to Woolwich. By Borgard's plan, and the others which succeeded it, we are spared the necessity of pursuing any further thc trifling and obscure details at which we have been \"lad to catch in searching: out the earlier facts relating to tbe Royal Arsenal. We may come at once to the renowned explosion at Moorfields, which was so long accounted the origin of the national workshop. It certainly had a material influence on our fortunes, as we shall see. The Moorfields Explosion. \u2014 Mr. Matthew Bagley* cast all the guns which the Government required from 1704 to 1716 at his foundry in Moorfields, near Finsbury Squares The guns captured by the Duke of Marlborough were in 1716 ordered to be used for the manu facture of newer ordnance, and on tbe 10th of May in that year a great many persons of quality assembled to witness the operation, including Borsard, who was then Colonel of Artillery and Chief Firemaster of England. The dampness of tbe mould, and the consequent generation of steam, caused the metal to be blown out again with terrible sound and fearful consequences. Seventeen persons were killed, including Mr. Bagley and his son ; and a number of others, among whom was Colonel Borgard, were wounded. X General Borgard's diary for 1716 says \u2014 In the month of March I was ordered by the Board of Ordnance to lay before them tables and draughts of all natures of brass and iron cannon, mortars, &c, which was done accordingly and approved of. After the said draughts, two twenty four pounder brass cannon were ordered to be cast by Mr. Bagley in his foundry at Windmill Hill, at the casting of which I was ordered to be present. In the foundry the metal of one of the guns blowed into the air, burnt many of the spectators, of which seventeen died out of twenty-five persons, and myself received four wounds. * The name strongly resembles that of Major Matthew Bayly, who removed the castim- from Moorfields to Woolwich thirty or forty years previous ly see page 318). t The present well-known Wesleyan Chapel in the City Road had its origin in the Old Foundry, in which Wesley and Whitfield preached to listening thousands. The foundry when disused was taken and fitted up by Mr Wesley and his friends for a place of worship, and was so used until it was deemed advisable to supersede it by the present building, for which they obtained an excellent frontage opening into the City Road. The \" new chapel\" as it was called-that is, the present City Road Chapel-stands a few yards from the old foundry, which ia reputed to have been the Government foundry for casting cannon many years P\"or to 1716. 1 A gun spoilt in the casting is exhibited at the Rotunda, Woolwich, as the product of this disaster."], [478, "322 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. The accident was a most deplorable one, but it was the making of Wool wich. Only a month elapsed when the following order appeared : \u2014 \"Mortis 19\u00b0 die Junij, 1716.

Andrew Schalch. \u2014 In the month following appears an order direct ing that \u2014 If the results of enquiry prove satisfactory, Mr. Andrew Schalch shall be em ployed in building the furnaces, and providing of the Necessary Utensills for the Royal Foundry at Woolwich, at \u00a3b a Day. untill Everything is provided and his performances approved.

He occupied an official residence in tbe Arsenal, the building in which tbe Ordnance Committee is now located, but removed to Charlton prior to his death, which took place in 1776 at tbe age of eighty-four years. He amassed an ample fortune. It is related of him that he would never suffer the furnaces to be opened until the workmen and spectators had joined with him in prayer. Mr. Schalch was buried in Woolwich churchyard, and lately a memorial window has been erected in the Garrison Church of St. George to the honour of him and his descendants, five of whom have been officers in tbe Royal Artillery. His two daughters married distinguished officers, * Some of Schalch's guns, cast in 1742, were, nearly a hundred years later (1840). recovered from the wreck ofthe Royal George."], [479, "WOOLWICH 323 Colonel Belson and Colonel Williamson, both of whom became Com mandants at Woolwich. The Old Foundry. \u2014 Next to the Tower Place, Schalcb's foundry is the oldest building in tbe Royal Arsenal. It is thus described in the Quarterly Review for January, 1858 : \u2014 With a stately solemnity which marked the conceptions of its builder, Vanbrugh, stands the picturesque gun factory, with its high-pitched roof, red brickwork, and carved porch, looking'like a fine old gentleman amid the factory ranges which, within these few years, have sprung up around. It is impossible to contemplate this building without respect, for forth from its portals have issued that victorious ordnance which, since the days of George II. , has swept the battle-grounds of the old and new worlds. An Impetus. \u2014 The plan of 1717 is useful in showing us tbe Warren in the year of its first impulse, the gun foundry having just been introduced. It also shows us by a dotted line the boundary of tbe enclosure on the east side, a line which very nearly coincides with the present division of Woolwich and Plumstead. It will be seen that a public way led towards tbe river from Burrage House, and that the great gravel pit had spread its contagion across the highway, forming a deep hollow where we now find the main gate in Beresford Square. The position of the entrance in 1717 is not clear, but there appears to have been an opening from the old town in Warren Lane. This is not quite so apparent in Borgard's plan of 1701. Departmental Seniority. \u2014 The plan of 1717 establishes the seniority of tbe Gun Foundry next after the Laboratory and Carriage Yard ; but tbe Dial Square appears to have been built soon afterwards from plans by Sir John Vanbrugh, which are dated in the same year, (1716), and may be seen in the national museum. Officers' Quarters. \u2014 The buildings adjacent, now converted into officers' residences, were the barracks of tbe Royal Artillery. They are described in Barker's map (1749) as the \" Old \" and \" New ' ' Barracks, and the earliest block, which faces the river, was built in 1719, as appears by the dates on the leaden waterspouts. The First Laboratory. \u2014 The primitive Laboratory was, however, already going to decay when these buildings were erected. General Borgard says in his diary \u2014 1717-18.\u2014 The Board came to a resolution to regulate what was wanting to corn pleat a compleat Artillery, for sea and land service. I laid before the Board the ill state of the Laboratory, which the Board ordered me to put in some better order, and to be at as little expense as possible, which I did accordingly. Carriage Yard. \u2014 The Carriage Department was also in need of improvement, and the order of July 24th, 1716, which includes the"], [480, "RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. 324 \"building of the Foundery at Woolwich,\" provides also for making \" two wharfs over the moat near the new carriage yard at ditto.\" Extensions in Plumstead.\u2014 Among the old buildings are also the stables near the Plumstead Gate, for they have water-tanks marked 1720 and 1729. The ground on which they stand must have been acquired subsequently to 1717. They may have formed part of a private residence, or the water-tanks may have come from some other building. The stables appear to have been attached to the Store Receiver's bouse, which stood adjacent on tbe west. Former Offices.\u2014 Part of the Dial Square facing the Laboratory is Paul Sandby, artist. From a portrait by himself now the residence of tbe manager of tbe Royal Gun Factories, and I am of opinion that this was formerly occupied by the Board of Ordnance as its offices. There is a very large room which would have been useful for board meetings, and it was probably in this apartment that the entertainments of which we read were given by the Gentlemen Cadets who occupied the contiguous Academy.

Historic Window.\u2014 Over the entrance-door of tbe old foundry was placed a stained-glass window, which remained there for many years. It is now to be seen in the Pattern Room of the Royal Gun Factories, whither it was removed about 1880. It represents King Edward III. and a group of bis officers examining an early speci men of ordnance, which lies on tressels before him, with a pyramid of shot close by, while the foreground is occupied by an ancient bombard, with its breach shaped like a ram's head, as if to connect it with the still older battering implements of tbe ancients.

On a garter at the base is the inscription, \" King Edward III. inspecting his Artillery.\" The Dial Square. \u2014 There is some doubt as to the period at which the Dial Square was built. The sun-dial over the gate bears tbe date of 1764, and ought to be a reliable authority, but the building is plainly outlined on Barker's plan, 1748, and the front next the river is unmis takable in Birch's view of 1739, its castellated walls standing, as now, between the Carriage Square and the Laboratory. The design of the \" front gate \" and \" the great pile of buildings \" at the Tower Place, previously mentioned, both refer obviously to the Dial Square, and"], [482, "326 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. both are dated 1717, about which time the building was in all pro bability erected. Tbe sun-dial is therefore misleading, and the date upon its face can only be accepted as a record of its own age. It may be assumed that the dial was an afterthought, subsequent to 1748, when the place was known as \" The Grand Square, or storehouse of artificers' shops.\" It is possible that the Grand Square was covered in as we now see it in 1764. TRoyal Military Academy. \u2014 Thus far we have followed the fortunes of the primitive arsenal down to the beginning of the eighteenth century, and seen its first important outgrowth from the Tower Place. so that same focus our attention is drawn for some time longer. Full twenty years after the reconstruction of the building it continued to be used as official quarters; but when the advancement of gunnery v-alled for a special education the ample apartments of the Tower House were fixed upon as most suitable and appropriate for tbe purpose, Accordingly, in 1741, we find the historic structure converted into the View from Rupert's Walk, 1749 nursery of the Royal Military Academy, and The Gentleman's Magazine of that year thus announces the fact : \u2014 An academy is ordered to be built at Woolwich for instructing the gentlemen belonging to the train of artillery. Like the history of tbe Royal Artillery, the associations of the Royal Academy run for a while collaterally with the records of the Royal Arsenal, but to all practical intents diverge from the progress of the manufacturing branches almost from their beginning. Being located together, and under one head, they cannot be wholly separated until a later period, but they must henceforth, in the main, be distinctly treated. More Batteries. \u2014 The Warren remained for many years a com bination of school, barracks, factory, and fortification,\" affording full play to the versatile genius of its master-mind, Borgard. Here he erected, upon the most scientific principles, two gun-batteries and a bomb-battery in 1737, the former mounting in all five guns, and the"], [483, "WOOLWICH. 327 latter a single mortar only. This work has disappeared, and left no more sign than the earlier defences of Prince Rupert. Without further prefix, I may now introduce a few miscellaneous extracts from the public prints of tbe period :\u2014 1740. June 20.\u2014 Complaint having been made to the Lords of the Admiralty that the gunpowder used by the three men-of-war when they took the Pnncessa was weaker than the powder taken in the said ship, in the proportion of seven to twelve, it was thought proper to make a publick tryal. In order thereto, some gunpowder was taken out of each of the above four ships, put into four boxes at Portsmouth, which were sealed up by some officers of the Navy and Ordnance, and sent to town and tins day try'd at Woolwich before the D. of Montagu, Master-* teneral of the Ord nance, Sir Charles Wager, Lord Vere Beauclerk, General Borgard, some captains of men-of-war, &c, in three divers ways. 1. By raising a weight of 20 lbs. 7 oz. with 2 drams of powder. 2. By tiring a twelve-pounder shot out of a 05-inch mortarwith a quarter of an ounce of powder. 3. By firing a half-pound shut out of a swivel gun with 2 drams of powder. In the first experiment the English p. iwder raised the weight from 4 inches to G and some tenths, and the Spanish no higher than 1 inch and 9 tenths. In proving by the swivel gun, the English powder threw the ball 15? feet at an elevation of 61 degrees, and the Spanish had not strength enough to throw it out of the gun ; and the tryal by the mortar turned out equally in favour of the English powder. Notwithstanding the above account, many persons who have been at Portsmouth affirm that the shot ofthe Princessa were much sharper thrown than those of our men-of-war, some of hers going through the sides of our ships when ours stuck in her half-way. 1741. February.\u2014 On Monday last a most melancholy accident happened at the Royal Foundry at Woolwich, where an old Bombshell which had some days before been landed from on board one of the Tenders, and whose charge had not been with drawn, took fire, and bursting, it wounded six of the Matrosses so dangerously that two are since dead ; the third had both his legs and his right arm cut off ; and if the others should live, the surgeons are of opinion, That they never can recover the Use of all their Limbs. 1742. May 24. \u2014 The three battalions of Foot Guards embarked at Woolwich for Flanders. 1742. June 12. \u2014 There is at present the greatest quantity of large ordnance at Woolwich that has been known, which excites the curiosity of numbers of peopleand draws them thither. 1744. July 7. \u2014 Last Saturday his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland, attended by several persons of distinction, went to Woolwich, where the large mor tars and cohorns lately cast there were prov'd, and were allowed by the officers present to be the finest ever cast. 1744. September 8. \u2014 An order is sent from the Board of Ordnance to the Foundery at Woolwich for the casting a great number of brass and iron cannon ; and for that purpose the ancient pieces that have lain there for some time are to be melted down. The Marquis of Granby. \u2014 In 1764 there was a grand display of fireworks in honour of the Marquis of Granby's birthday, \" played off on the green at Woolwich Warren,\" as related with much circumstance in the St. James's Chronicle of that year. There was also displayed a transparency inscribed \"Long live Granby,\" and after tbe fireworks"], [484, "328 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. there was a dinner at the Ship Tavern, where Col. Williamson* pre sided, and most of the artillery officers were present. The Marquis of Granby, afterwards Duke of Rutland, was Lieute nant-General from 1759 to 1763, and Master-General 1763-72. In 1764 be reorganised tbe Royal Military Academy. He augmented the Cadet Company, and increased the allowance to each cadet from Is. 4-c/. to 2s. 6d. per day. He also appointed superior professors, and improved Th, Marquis of Granby. the character of the institution by establishing a qualifying examina tion. In 1766 he instituted two gold and two silver medals as prizes of honour to the gentlemen cadets. The Marquis, who was also com mander-in-chief of the army, was born in 1721, and died in 1770 from a sudden attack of gout in tbe stomach. With a brilliant career as a soldier he combined a most generous character. One who served with him has written of him\u2014 Oft have I seen his hand stretched out to supply the wants of the needy soldier ; * Colonel George Williamson, R.A., became a general officer in 1762, and died at Woolwich m 1781. He ought not to have been described as a colonel in 1764."], [485, "WOOLWICH. 329 nor did the meanest follower of his camp go hungry from his door. His table was hospitality itself, and his open countenance gave a hearty welcome to all his guests. On the other hand, the Marquis had the misfortune to be terribly criticised in tbe famous \" Letters of Junius.\" He was very partial to Woolwich, and his name repeatedly appears in the chronicles as a visi tor both before and after his appointment to the head of the Ordnance. There is still a tavern near the Arsenal bearing his name. Progress and Change.\u2014 To realise the extent and character of the Royal Arsenal at this period of its history, it is needful to examine minutely the plan of Mr. John Barker, as reproduced on page 40. The \"old\" and \"new\" \"carriage yards\" which figure in Borgard's map of 1701 (Plate XXXIII.) disappear in Barker's plan, and the moat, formed with so much care, had become obsolete. The Laboratory, Dial, and Carriage Squares bad been formed, compact and regular, but the old foundry stood in its old corner, and there was nothing else. The Dial and Laboratory Squares were still open and but partly built, and a foun tain played in the centre of each.* The Laboratory yard and Tower Place (the Royal Military Academy) were not enclosed. The present officers' quarters were the \" old \" and \" new Artillery Barracks,\" and tbe gate of the Royal Arsenal was a narrow porcbway in a recess thirty yards to the west of the opening which we now have. The Nightingale Valley brook ran through tbe Warren from the sandpits ; the practice butt was just beyond it (near the site of the shell foundry), where it had been built forty years earlier. Gravel-pits and marshes made up the rest, and ploughed fields abutted against the eastern boundary, which may now be marked by a line stretching from the corner of Burrage Road to the T Pier.t Rupert's wall is seen extending along the em bankment of tbe river, and two batteries, probably those constructed byBorgard, project. Standing precisely where it has done to this day, is \" the flag that's braved a thousand years,\" but there is very little else that has not undergone a transformation. In Buck's view (Plate III.) there are seen three guns at tbe flagstaff, and some distance in the rear the north walls of the Carriage Department and Dial Square. The Laboratory is partly hidden, but the Tower is conspicuous, and three turrets stand boldly out. The two other turrets I am not able to explain. They are not shown in Barker's sketch from Rupert's walk at page 326. * The south portion of the Dial Square, which was first erected, was called the \" Bason Square,\" and its fountain is represented by a circular figure. Fountains w*ere not unusually introduced for ornamental purposes in the courts of workshops, as well as of dwelling-places, in the early part of the eighteenth century. t The map of 1717 shows the boundary line of the Warren identical with the parish boundary, which enters at the Ordnance Chapel and emerges close to the T pier. This was the full extent of the Warren until 1777."], [486, "330 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Mr. John Barker, to whom we are so much indebted, was an instructor at the Royal Military Academy. A Flourishing Place. \u2014 Austin, vicar of Hoo, writing of Wool wich about this time (1762), says : \u2014 Besides ye building yard, here is a large ropewalk where the biggest cables are made for men-of-war, and on ye east or lower part of the town is ye Gun Walk or Yard, commonly called ye Park, or the Gun Park, where there is a prodigious quantity of cannon of all sorts. Here is also ye house where ye firemen and engineers prepare their fireworks to charge bombs, carcases, and grenadoes for ye public service. The town of late years is much enlarged and also beautified. It is indifferently built, but the fine yard and docks make it a flourishing place. That place which is called the Warren is the most pleasing to a traveller's eye. To ye eastward of ye buildings is a mount where ye train of artillery try or scale their cannon. \u2014 MS. in British Museum. Another Fire. \u2014 The Annual Register of 1766 tells us that in August of that year \u2014 A fire broke out in the Laboratory, Woolwich Warren, which burnt very furiously for some time, but was at last extinguished by the carpenters and matrosses belonging to the Warren. A man who was at work when the fire began was burnt to death. Gunpowder Trials. \u2014 The same journal, under date of September 11, 1767, says : \u2014 The following warlike experiments are said to have been lately made at Woolwich by Mr. Cross, and were found to answer, but are not adopted, for particular reasons : 1. To fix gunpowder under the earth, and when trod upon to be blown up. 2. To fix gunpowder under a gate, and when opened will be blowm up. 3. To fix gunpow der under the earth, and by lifting up anything that he may lay thereon, will be blown up. 4. To fix gunpowder under the greatest building on London side of the Thames, Mr. Cross will stand the opposite side and blow it up without using match or train. He has brought to perfection also a moving battery, which is to be drawn by horses and is to be made use of in time of battle, when fifty men can withstand a thousand firing cannon, small arms, grenades, &e. The Old Foundry in 1887."], [487, "George III CHAPTER XXIX BAPTISM OF THE ROYAL ARSENAL The First Royal Record. \u2014 It is not until the year 1773 that we have recorded the first visit to the Royal Arsenal of a sovereign of England, but it would be rash to assume that the important works which had been in operation here for more than half a century had not been previously recognised by the reigning monarch. Tbe date was July 6th, 1773, and the King was therefore George III.* A news paper thus describes the event : \u2014 On Tuesday last the King arrived at this place (Woolwich). At a little before ten in the morning his Majesty entered the Warren (preceded by twenty-four rope makers dressed in white with round hats decorated by ribbons, who had run before his Majesty's carriage from Blaekheath) attended by a party of the light horse. Hi*; Majesty stepped out of his carriage and was received by Lord Townsend as Master- General of the Ordnance, on the Parade, when he was saluted by a discharge of twenty-one twelve-pounders. The guard rested their arms, and the drums and mush* beat the march ; the royal standard was displayed on the mortar battery, and even window filled wdth ladies. His Majesty passed in front of the old invalids and tin guard, to the new-erected foundery, t where Mr. Van Bruggen shewed His Majestj the various progressions of casting brass guns, such as the preparation of the clay tunning the moulds, filing the trunnions, and the motion of the tire in the * The visit of James II.

The boring was done by horse labour, as shown by a model in the Rotunda museum."], [488, "332 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. furnaces, occasioned by the subterraneous galleries that convey an uncommon blast of wind from every quarter. The King then entered the boring-room, for boring guns cast solid, by an horizontal boring machine, extremely curious and well contrived (likewise the work of Mr. Van Bruggen) where a forty-two-pounder was bored in his Majesty's presence. From the foundry his Majesty went through the \"un walk to the mortar-battery, and saw several shells thrown from mortars of various diameters both for land and sea service ; some ricochet granadoes were like wise thrown from howitzers. From thence his Majesty went to the Royal Military Academy, * where he saw a very curious model of a fortification, together with the lines of approach, parallels, and saps, explained in a very military-like manner by the inspector of the Academy, Capt. Smith, who is said to have been twelve years in the Prussian Service. His Majesty then viewed the drawings and other exercises of the Upper Academy, explained by Dr. Pollock, Professor of Artillery and Fortification; after which he returned into the grand room of the Academy, and was regaled with a breakfast and repast. Beanfeast. \u2014 The Beanfeast holiday which is annually observed at the Royal Arsenal is probably attributable to the incident just men tioned. Tbe traditionary origin of tbe \"Beanfeast\" is an incognito visit paid by this same king soon after his accession ; and we are asked to believe that his Majesty, having dined alfresco with a party of labourers on beans and bacon, instituted the annual beanfeast in remembrance of the occasion. Tbe day on which it is held is always the second Saturday in July, which corresponds very nearly with the date of tbe visit in 1773. I have heard that the very warrant by which it was instituted was in existence not very long since, but it would be more satisfactory to see it. f Beanfeasts are known to be as old as civilisation ; there are records of them among tbe ancients, and they certainly belong to the category of old English customs. It is natural to suppose that at a time when there were no Bank Holidays, and when Coronation Day was in October, tbe boon of a midsummer day's recreation, enjoyed by most other workpeople, may have been bestowed upon the Royal Warren as a memento of this auspicious visitation, and took the national title of \" beanfeast.\" An Inventor. \u2014 In concluding the chronicles of this interesting period, I must mention Lieutenant John Bell, R.A., who died in 1794. He was born at Carlisle in 1747, and was tbe inventor of many in genious mechanical appliances, one of the simplest of which is still in use in the Royal Arsenal, being the method of breaking up guns and other old metal by the fall of a heavy ball. He also designed \" Bell's gyn,\" * At the Tower House. + It has been customary to destroy the departmental books when a few years out of date. Many of the early records relating to Woolwich were destroyed in the fire which took place at the Tower of London in 1841 ; many more were lost owing to the practice which once prevailed of allowing the higher officials of the War Depart ment to take away their letter-books on resigning office."], [489, ""], [490, "[To face paje 33:i.

The Middle Age. \u2014 Our records now approach more modern times, and the plenteous materials at command require some selection. They have already pointed to the approaching flight of the Military Academy and Artillery Barracks from their nestling quarters, and in a few years after we find them both taking wing. The Second Academy. \u2014 The Company of Cadets was augmented by the King at one stroke from forty to one hundred, in the month of January, 1778, and, the Tower Place being overfull, the newer Academy eastward of the gate was erected. This range of buildings (shown at Plate XXXIY.) is now used as officers' residences, a school, and the Arsenal Institute, but they were occupied, wholly or in part, by tbe cadets until 1850, and the green in front was honeycombed by them in the practice of constructing mines, parapets, parallels, approaches, batteries, and magazines. This green seems to have been better preserved when this picture was drawn (1789), and was encircled by a road, which the carriage in the distance is following to reach the gate. The open space is probably a remnant of tbe original \"Woolwich Green,\" and still exists as a lawn in front of the Carriage Department Pattern Room. Departure of the Cadets. \u2014 This, the second Academy, did not flourish for much more than twenty years, and was for a short time entirely vacated, when the present Academy was built. It is stated in the \"Beauties of England and Wales,\" that in 1806\u2014 The building which was recently the Royal Military Academy is unappropriated, the Cadets having very recently removed to the new building on the common. Here Mrs. Simpson, relict of the celebrated mathematical professor, died at the great age of one hundred and two. She was buried at Plumstead. The building was afterwards reoccupied by the senior class of Cadets, and finally evacuated in 1850. f The Royal Artillery. \u2014 Still more rapidly the Royal Artillery outgrew its shell. Tbe two wings which form a right angle at the south-east corner of the Dial Square were one after another provided, but the regiment had swollen almost beyond their capacity by the middle of the eighteenth century, and I believe that at one time a portion of the corps was quartered in the range of buildings which now forms * Page 279. t See \" Records of the Garrison.\" Y"], [492, "334 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. the face of the Laboratory. The regiment was transferred to the new barracks on the Common in 1775, and their old residence was converted into officers' quarters, which they still remain. Ordnance Stores.\u2014 Towards the end of thc last century, the bulk of the Ordnance stores, which had theretofore been kept at the Tower of London, were transferred to the Arsenal, the present immense ware bouses of the Ordnance Department being then built. Up to that time, the original level of the ground had been little altered. The open stream ran through and formed the moat as of old, and most ofthe area Ordnance Church, drawn in 1830. was a marsh-swamp. There was the wharf at the Laboratory end of the river front, and the three squares of buildings \u2014 Laboratory, Gun Factory, and Carriage Department \u2014 were in position ; but eastward of tbe stream were marsh meadows, still depending upon the protection of the ancient embankment of the Thames, while the snipe and rabbit retained an interest in most of the soil. With the creation of the Ordnance Store Department came, however, a great change. The wharf, from the octagon guard-bouses to the coal-dock, was con structed, chiefly by convict labour, and the level of the whole space enclosed by the buildings was raised, except in two or three places,"], [493, "335 WOOLWICH. which seem to have been left to show the original depression.* These may be seen just within the main gates on the right, and at the stables behind the officers' quarters. Later, when the area was extended, and the higher level was carried to the canal, another exception was made of the orchard now known as \" the Colonel's Garden,\" and the adjoining space occupied by the composition buildings of tbe East Laboratory, which appear to possess their original surfaces. Sandby's Sketch. \u2014 If we refer now to Sandby's \" View from AVoolwich Warren,\" at page 23, we shall find a difficulty in fixing the standpoint ; but as the church seen in the left-band corner can have been no other than tbe parish church of Woolwich, the prospect is certainly up-river, and consequently the portion from which it was taken must be somewhere near the curve of the \"bight.\" I have con jectured that the artist stood below tbe site of tbe boat-house, and ancient mariners tell me that thereabout in their time stood a number of trees, which may have formed the orchard or other enclosure depicted in this pretty drawing, the date of which may be fixed at about 1775. Higher Consequence. \u2014 The increasing importance of the place at the beginning of tbe present century is mentioned by various writers. \" Pennant's Journey,\" of 1801, says : \u2014 The ships launched here and at Deptford take in their guns from the magazine of artillery established at this place. The guns of every ship are placed apart in terrific order ; the heavy cannon for batteries and the mortars and shells and balls piled in elegant forms complete the tremendous scene. It was a compliment equally tine and just which the poet payed to Charles IL, possibly on this very spot- Had the old Greeks discovered your'abode, Crete had not been the cradle of their god ; On that small island they had looked with scorn, And in Great Britain thought the thunder born. In the Universal Magazine, 1803, the establishment is thus de scribed : \u2014 There is a large Ropewalk, where cables are made for men-of-war, and in the lower part of the town is the Gun Yard, commonly called the Park, or the Gun Park where are cannon of all sorts for ships of war ; every ship's guns lying in tiers, or rows apart ; heavy cannon for batteries, and mortars of all sizes, so that there have been laid up here at once between seven and eight thousand pieces of ordnance, * In digging the foundation for the Director-General's offices, opposite the Medical Establishment, in June, 1888, the workmen disclosed, eight feet underground, a rect angular wall, which was traced sixty feet north by eighty feet east. It was about eighteen inches thick, three feet high, and finished at the top, upon which had evidently stood a wooden erection. The site was almost identical with that ol the Firework Barn in Borgard's map (Plate XXXIII.), but the dimensions will not agree and it was probablv the remnant of a later building. Under the eight feet of artificial earth a halfpenny \"was found bearing the date 1777, which will give us approximately the date of the altered level. Y 2"], [494, "336 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. besides mortars and shells without number. There is both a civil and a military branch of the Office of Ordnance established at Woolwich. The civil branch is under the management of a storekeeper, clerk of the survey, clerk of the cheque, clerk of the foundry, and other officers, who have many inferior servants and workmen under them. The military branch of the Office of Ordnance is under the direction of a chief engineer, who ranks as colonel ; two directors, who rank as lieutenant colonels ; and four sub-directors, as majors. The engineers in ordinary rank as cap tains, the engineers extraordinary as captain-lieutenants, and the sub-engineers as lieutenants ; beside which, are several practitioner engineers. Under this office, in a place called the Warren, artillery of all kinds and dimensions are cast, which, before the building of the powder magazine at Purfleet, were usually proved here, in the presence of the principal engineers and officers of the Board of Ordnance, to which many of the nobility and gentry are invited, and sumptuously entertained by them. The gunpowder which is contracted by the Office of Ordnance is proved here, with regard to its strength and goodness, and its fitness for the public service. There is besides a laboratory belonging to this office, under the direction of a controller, a chief fire-master, a fire-master's mate, a clerk, and other workmen and labourers. The companies of matrosses are employed in making fireworks and cartridges, and in charging bombs, carcases, and grenadoes. Change Of Name. \u2014 George III., whose earlier visit has been men tioned, was again at the Warren in 1805, and the occasion is remarkable as it gave rise to the name of \" The Royal Arsenal.\" The circumstance is thus narrated in the Gentleman's Magazine, under date of Thursday, July 27th, 1805 :\u2014 The Ordnance Board have signified to General Lloyd, who commands the artillery at Woolwich, that the Warren at that place is no longer to bear that name ; but from this time to be denominated the \" Royal Arsenal ! \" The old name had its origin from the place having actually been a rabbit warren, but the name of one of the tamest of all animals was certainly ill-suited to the nature of the place. On the recent Royal visit to what is called the Warren, where all ordnance, stores, ammuni tion, &c, are lodged, His Majesty noticed how little appropriate the name was to the place, and suggested the propriety of changing it to that of \" Arsenal.\" * The Master. General admitted the justice of the idea, and instantly adopted it ; henceforward therefore, in compliment to His Majesty's suggestion, the Warren is to be called \" the Royal Arsenal.\" A portion of the Arsenal was, however, known as the Warren as recently as 1837, the edict of the King applying only to the foundry, gun-wharf, powder magazine, and other buildings at the western end.f Etymology : arx navalis, whence the Romaunt arthenal, signifying primarily a \" naval citadel.\" The term \"arsenal\" is not so modern as its application.

ENLARGING THE ROYAL ARSENAL. Extension. \u2014 It appears to have been in the year 1777 that the great enlargement of the place was carried out by tbe purchase of additional land from the Dowager Lady Wilson and Sir Thomas Wilson, Bart.* There is an order extant dated 1779, from the Master- General of the Ordnance to the Governor of the Royal Military Academy, requiring \"a plan of Woolwich Warren, with all the buildings in the state they were in before the ground was purchased of Sir Thomas Wilson, and a plan in its present state with all the additions marked.\" This was probably needed to show the second cadet-barracks. The old Warren we have seen consisted of only forty-two acres, but this enlargement made it about a hundred acres, and forty acres more were added before 1810. Both these additions were necessarily in the parish of Plumstead. t Accidents. \u2014 It may be remarked that the turn-out of work was not a fiftieth part of the present production, but the proportion of mishaps was many times as great. The following are reported by the journals and other authorities of the period : \u2014 1770. March 9th. \u2014 Yesterday there was a grand proof of brass mortars and about a hundred large iron cannon in our Warren. The mortars all appeared full proof, and discharged the balls to a very great distance in the river, signals being hoisted at different points to caution the shipping to keep out of the way ; but two of the cannon burst into pieces and were forced into different parts of the Warren, but providentially no damage was done, nothwithstanding a great many spectators were present. 1779.

Among other damage, the Repository,t which contained numerous models 'of bridges, fortifications, &c, was destroyed ; but the well-known and accurate model of Gibraltar, which was partially injured, was preserved and repaired.* 1805 June 30th (Sunday).\u2014 At 9.45 p.m. a fire broke out in the store department and consumed two wooden storehouses, two storeys high and nearly a hundred and seventy feet long, filled with boxes of grape and canister, and about half a million boxes were destroyed. The Royal Artillerymen were turned out to prevent the destruction of the magazine, and to save the clothing store, which contained more than eight thousand suits. They covered the roof of the magazine with wet blankets, &c, till it was out of danger, though the heat was so great that the men were obliged to be played on by the engines to preserve them from fainting. The two buildings consumed were behind the moat ; not a vestige remains. The fixe was not the effect of accident, as it burst out in five different places at once, and the stores were locked up by the proper officers on Saturday and not opened on Sunday. 1805.\u2014 The great magazine for holding powder was this year destroyed as a precaution against accidents, and all the gunpowder kept for the use of the artillery departments deposited in small vessels anchored near the Royal Arsenal, and thence transferred to magazines erected in the marshes. \u00a7 1813. September 2nd.\u2014 A. fire broke out in the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich on Monday, owing to the folly of a workman employed in the building called the Dipping Square. A female expressing a wish to see a rocket star, the man to gratify her curiosity let one off in his hand, which coming in contact with the fire, he threw it down, and it communicated to some combustible materials. Happily no lives were lost and the fire was subdued in about an hour. 1814. June 20th. \u2014 An unfortunate explosion took place in the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, in one of the sheds appropriated for making fireworks ; in consequence of which four of the workmen lost their lives, and two others were wounded. By the exertions of the officers on the spot, the fire was prevented from injuring any of the other buildings, and it was entirely got under in less than half an hour. Some more recent explosions will be dealt with separately, but there have been few fires of recent years worth comment. On January 28tb, 1855, the Lancaster Shell Foundry was destroyed by fire, but such are the precautions now taken that for a number of years past there have been no fire records except a few important \" stops,\" one which threatened most being in the old building of which the Labora tory Drawing Office formed part and another in the Royal Carriage Department Store. * Discontent and disaffection were hereditary failings in the Government works, but at this time the workmen were treated with much greater consideration than formerly. In this same year (1802) an Act of Parliament was passed, by w-hich the men in the Warren were exempted from serving in the Militia. (42 Geo. III. Cap. 90, Sec. 43.) t Tower Place.

They are in point of date a hundred and ten years apart, but their resemblance is remark able. The proof in the first paragraph was on the old ground near the Carriage Square. The butts in the second case are the butts in the practice range below the canal. 174'2- \u2014 0\" Friday there was a proof of iron ordnance at Woolwich, when a 24-pdr. burst, and apiece of metal about 4 cwt. flew near 300 yards over the heads of the people, and fell upon the top of a chimney of a house adjoining the founder's, broke through the roof and through three stories down to the ground floor, and providentially did no other mischief. The gun, in its agitation before bursting, turned that which lay next to it so as to point its muzzle towards the spectators and the storekeeper's house, and had it not struck out the portfire, which was lighted, great mischief would probably have ensued. 1852. February.\u2014 A proof of guns was taking place at the butts, several being placed side by side, double loaded, and made ready to be fired by slow match. The fuzes were ignited and the range party retired under cover. But the first gun to fire burst asunder, and turned the next gun in the direction of the town. When its charge ignited, the shot flew into the air over the Arsenal and the streets of Woolwich, where it was seen and heard whizzing overhead, and finally descended two miles away, through the roof and several floors of a house in the Dockyard, close to the gates. As it was just the dinner hour, some thousands of workmen were crowding out of the gates, but happily no one was injured. Some excuses may be found for disasters in the fact of the work being in so large a degree experimental and mostly done by hand labour. It was the age of invention, and, in the art of gunnery as in other directions, science was busy with new contrivances. Shrapnell Shell. \u2014 The Shrapnell shell was invented by Colonel Shrapnell in 1804, and he was granted \u00a31,200 by Parliament in recog nition of his valuable discovery. The shell was used on service for the first time in Spain by Colonel Robe, R.A., under command of Sir Arthur Wellesley, in 180S, and the enemy were considerably astonished at finding themselves exposed to a fire of musket balls at over a mile range. The shells were cast and perfected by Gunner John Henderson, R.A., who was afterwards appointed master founder at the Royal Arsenal at \u00a32 per diem, which post he held until This death, October 16th, 1826.* Rockets. \u2014 Rockets, from being merely pastime fireworks, were applied to the saving of life from shipwreck in 1809. 1809.

Tbe Hale rocket, which dispenses with the use of a stick, was invented by Mr. Hale, a mechanic in the Royal Arsenal, about 1845. Detonation. \u2014 The introduction of detonation in the firing of large guns is announced under date of \u2014 1840. September llth. \u2014 A party us the Royal Artillery proceeded to the proof butt in the Royal Arsenal, on Friday, to try a plan for discharging large pieces of ordnance by a hammer and detonating powder, the present system being with a portfire ignited and kept burning until the word of command is given. The gun selected was a 32 pounder and 40 rounds were fired with great satisfaction. Tubes and Fuzes. \u2014 The friction tube and time-fuze, which are still, like the Shrapnell shell and the life-saving rocket, in general use all* over the world, were introduced to public notice in the followino paragraphs: \u2014 1840. December 18th. \u2014 In October last four hundred percussion tubes for field guus, made according to a plan invented in Hanover, with twelve thongs for firing them, were issued to two field batteries at Woolwich. Two hundred common tubes used with portfire were also issued, with instructions that they should be fired at the same time. Tiie experiments are now complete and favourable to the adoption cf tin* new tubes. Out of two hundred fired, twenty of the wire plugs were drawn without igniting the percussion powder, two without igniting the cartridge, and six. hung fire ; the remainder were all very good. 1841. September nth. \u2014 Experiments were made at lhe mortor battery on the barrack-field with a newly invented fuzee for exploding shells at a given number of seconds after they have been projected from the mortars. The first six fired were thirteen inches in diameter, fitted on a principle invented by Mr. Marsh, chemist of the Royal Arsenal, the fuzee being in the form of a screw, the composition being placed in the hollows, and when ignited or discharged, burns at the late of one inch in two seconds. Lieut.-Colonel Dansey, R.A., afterwards gave orders to fire three shells fitted with luzees invented by him.

He is inventor also of a discovery for the detection of poison by arsenic, to the study of which he turned in consequence of the Bodie case, and for this the Society of Arts have awarded him their large gold medal. Mr. Marsh's salary in 1839 was but 30s. per week. The Momentum of 1840.\u2014 The Royal Arsenal was at this period (1840) making another move onward. Since the beginning of tbe great wars of tbe last century and the increase of the establishments in 1777 there had been little variation calling for particular notice. Tbe Peninsular campaign and the struggle which culminated at Waterloo kept tbe place uniformly busy for a long series of years, and then came a long depression. The demand for war material necessarily declined with the prospects of a permanent peace, and tbe old and evil system of obtaining warlike stores by contract prevailed to a considerable extent. It is something to boast now that no iron gun was ever cast in the Royal Arsenal, but at tbe cast-iron period it was .a sore point to see that all the cast-iron guns were made by private firms and sent to tbe Arsenal merely to be passed by tbe Inspector-General of Artillery. This officer was then in charge of the Brass Foundry (forerunner of the Gun Factories) and occupied a position equivalent to that of the present Superintendent. Before Steam.- \u2014 The Brass Foundry in 1835 employed only ten men, but tbe Inspector of Artillery bad thirty-five others working under him apart from the foundry. The casting of those brass guns which were considered the beau ideal of artillery, and tbe boring mills in tbe Dial Square, with machinery worked by horse labour, are among the early recollections of our present generation. In 1835 the Carriage Department employed ninety-five men, working five days a week, and the Laboratory had upon its books a, hundred and thirty-six men and boys, all told. Possibly two hundred more may have been employed in the Storekeeper's Department, chiefly old pensioners, labouring about the wharves and warehouses. Cock's Guide Book of 1837 says : \u2014 The weight of the largest gun cast in the Arsenal is ninety cwt. Although a gun will require, however much the manufacture may be accelerated, eleven or twelve days to complete it, vet they are completed at the rate of one and a quarter per day. including Sundays. \"The mould is secured by being strongly bound with iron hoops and the gun is cast solid. The next process is that of boring and turning, which are both performed at one time. A large \" bit \" of the diameter wanted is fixed, and against this the gun revolves, four horses being required to move it. The same authority adds : \u2014 During the late war the number of men and boys employed in the Laboratory alone amounted to nearly 2,500 ; there are not at the present time more than 500 engaged throughout the whole establishment.\" But 1840 witnessed a new development consequent on the rearma-"], [502, "342 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. ment of the TNavy, in which the Admiralty at one stroke rendered obsolete 10,000 guns and carronades, and introduced the 32-pounder and the 8-inch shell gun. The guns, being cast iron, were still made by contract, until the institution of the Royal Gun Factory and the introduction of the Armstrong rifled gun about 1857-8. But orders for 14,000 guns, extending over fourteen years, even if put out to contract, required new carriages and equipments, and for these fourteen years the departments got an appreciable extension of work. In the ten years ending 1853-4 tbe wages paid annually in the manufacturing departments ranged from \u00a334,000 (in 1841-5) to \u00a372,000 (in 1848-9). The Steam Age. \u2014 Steam-power had in tbe meantime been intro duced, improved machinery adopted, and the organization of the several departments placed on such a footing that tbe Royal Arsenal was regarded as almost in a state of perfection, although, regarded from our present point of view, matters were in a comparatively crude condition. But in one or two features the Arsenal bas undergone no change during the lifetime of the present generation. Wharf and Wall. \u2014 The west wharf and the great external wall of the Arsenal have stood from the earliest recollections of the oldest inhabitant, and it becomes a matter of some curiosity to know how they were brought into being, in place of the wooden fences and the river bank which formerly guarded the privileged ground on its several sides. It has been shown in the annals of the Ropery that the western wharf in front of the Laboratory existed from a very remote date, and I have just met with a complaint made by tbe ropemakers in 1665 of delays by reason of the wharf's condition, in consequence of which \" thirty eight feet of wharfing at the crane in the gun-yard \" were ordered to be repaired. But this small wharf, reaching no farther than tbe first causeway or steps opposite tbe Laboratory offices, sufficed for all requirements until quite late in the eighteenth century, as may be seen by the drawings (pp. 4 and 40). The line of the original \" sea-wall \" is distinctly shown in a plan of the Thames prepared by Captain Bullock, R.N.,* in 1831 (Crace collection), and appears about fifty feet in rear of tbe present wharf frontage. But, strictly speaking, this line should represent the edge of the land, there having been no artificial embankment except at the lower part of tbe Royal Arsenal, where it assimilated with the marshes. In front of tbe Ordnance Storehouses, until the wharves were erected, the tide washed up the gravel beach to the walls of the buildings. * Captain (afterwards Admiral) Bullock, lived for a number of years in a house which he built at Cantwell Road, Shooters' Hill."], [503, "WOOLWICH. 343 The Convicts. \u2014 The wharves were the work of convicts, and found them in useful employment for many years. We have seen that extensive improvements date from about 1777, all of which are due to these felon bands, and the Parliamentary Journals of 1778 speak of \u2014 The mortality among the convicts in consequence of working ashore below Wool wich \" making an embankment for the Board of Ordnance in a piece of marsh ground adjoining the Warren, and also a ditch, a mote, and a proof butt.\" Proof Butt. \u2014 The proof butt was at this time removed from the position in which we have seen it (near the Carriage Department) * to a remoter spot, on the site of the Gun Factory t with a range of 560 yards extending down N.E.E. from the Plumstead Road, where there was a martello tower, close to the site of the R. C. D. sawmills. Coal Dock. \u2014 It is evident that the wharf was not at first meant to be carried farther eastward than the coal dock. This recess, which is now sheltered by tbe left arm of tbe iron pier, was then at the extremity of the Arsenal, and is the outlet of a drain which may be conjectured to have formed the dock at its estuary ; at any rate, tbe dock was there before the wharf. Colonel Mudge, in a letter dated Maj* 1, 1810, says that a new wharf was built in 1809, and supplied with cranes for lifting ship's ordnance, and we read later that the wharf was continued east ward to the coal dock and completed in 1811. The allied sovereigns landed at the \" new wharf \" of the Royal Arsenal in 1814. Although it was not finished when the Ordnance map (p. 62) was drawn in 1810, this shows the wall and coal dock in their perfect state, and marks three projections beyond, which were probably the causeways which remain at the boat-house, and were in use for tbe Government ferry. The Canal. \u2014 But we find no sign ofthe Arsenal canal in this plan, and nobody I have ever met could tell me when this canal was cut. I searched in vain for its date, until I found in an old volume of tbe Arch\u0153ologia (7-412), a description of an elegant brass sword dug up in the summer of 1798, \" in tbe great marsh adjoining to Woolwich Warren, on making the boundary canal to the ground purchased for enlarging the Warren.\" Tbe canal, therefore, was one of the works carried out by the convicts at the end of last century. The remainder of the wharf building was accomplished by instalments, the next extension after the enclosure of the coal doek embracing tbe frontage as far as the boathouse, tbe site of which was then occupied by the convicts' laundry, standing beside the causeway at which the prisoners landed from the hulks. Tbe Justitia hulk lay just below this and the Warrior a little above, opposite the Laboratory. A third ship was employed as a hospital. * See Barker's map, page 40. t See Ordnance map, page 62."], [504, "344 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Convict Burials. \u2014 The gloomy story of the convict establishment is told elsewhere, but the mention of the subject recalls vivid recollec tions of the frequent burials of the poor wretches close to this spot. The bodies were brought ashore at the causeway as soon as the coroner and jury bad done with them ; a hole, not too deep, was dug, and, with not too much ceremony, the rough deal coffins were thrust out of sight. It was generally believed that as soon as night fell the corpses were removed by body-snatchers, but many skeletons have been discovered by the builders in later years. All round about the old butts was marsh in 1850, and the \"colonel's garden \" was the \" convicts' garden,\" in which they grew their vegetables. The butts were taken beyond the The Proof Butts at the Practice Range canal when the Royal Gun Factories were built in 1855, and now new butts for the proof of guns have been provided quite outside the Arsenal wall. In our illustration the two principal bays of the butts at the inner range are depicted, and the electric screens which are employed to measure the velocity of projectiles are seen to the front. At these two bays, which are filled with sand, all the important gunnery trials and experiments of the last forty years have taken place. The Ferry. \u2014 The military ferry at the boathouse just mentioned was established shortly prior to 1810, and the landing on the north is spoken of as \" Duval's Point,\" but, as it still exists, there is no difficulty"], [505, ""], [506, "PLATE XXXVI. Embarking Horses for the Crimea, 1854. [To face page 345.]"], [507, "345 WOOLWICH. in locating it close to the Bargehouse. At the same time the road was made from the ferry to East Ham, where it joined the highway to Romford. The East Wharf. \u2014 Very old men remember the making of the east wharf, and the reed bed which occupied the river front below the boathouse is well within their recollection. The canal, being first em banked, was made useful in the raising of the surface about this part of the Arsenal. Most of the material came from the excavation of St. Katherine's Docks, and barges discharged it at the canal side. Tbe convicts also dredged mud from the shoals in the river and poured it in behind the wharf wall, which was built in a great measure of clay dug from the foreshore. This, the east, wharf was probably constructed chiefly for the purpose of employing tbe convicts, for it was very little used for very many years. The Arsenal Piers. \u2014 Both the existing piers of the Royal Arsenal were built long subsequent to the erection of the wharves. When there were no piers at the Arsenal it was customary to send stores off to ships in the river by means of lighters or small boats, and the whole of the horses despatched from Woolwich to tbe Crimea in 1854 were hoisted on board by derricks from the yard-arm opposite the Dockyard and Arsenal. The First Pier. \u2014 In 1855-6 the T-pier was constructed, but for a short time previously the Royal Laboratory had provided for its own urgent needs a wooden projection, jutting out from the western end of the wharf opposite the saw-mills. The need of some such provision had been acutely felt during the war pressure, and, for the special advantage of the Laboratory, the temporary pier was fitted with troughs for rolling the spherical shot and shell from the factory on board ship. This system of loading, however, did not answer, and the pier was of so insufficient a character that it was condemned and demolished when the T-pier was opened in 1856. The T-Pier. \u2014 This pier, which is chiefly of timber, has been of immense service to the Royal Arsenal, especially in times of emergencies, but the birth of the \" Woolwich Infant \" of thirty-five tons, and the still more enormous giants of later years, urgently demanded some more adequate provision for their necessities. The Iron Pier.\u2014 In 1864, the Royal Engineer Department commenced the new iron pier opposite the Royal Gun Factories, and it was to some extent ready for use in the following year, but the increasing weight of heavy ordnance required an accession of strength and dimensions, and it was completed in its present form and opened in 1872. The one-hundred-ton crane upon it has since had its power"], [508, "346 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. increased to a hundred and thirty tons, and the whole structure is nov/ reo-arded by experts as one of tbe most perfect of its kind\" in the world. The cylinders and other castings were made in the Royal Gun Fac tories. Before the Piers. \u2014 Unlike the East Wharf, the West Wharf has been a most valuable possession, especially prior to the creation of the piers. In 1811 we read that \u2014 On the new wharf are a considerable number of cranes for loading ordnance store ships, and so greatly has this improved the former means of fitting out the artillery department, as well as that of the engineers, that within eight days all the ordnance transports attached to the fleet for the Copenhagen expedition were completely ready and dropped down to the Gallions. A noble range of storehouses, constituting three sides of a square, has been built opposite to this wharf, and it is appropriated to the purpose of receiving carriages for service. A very important branch of business, called the Royal Carriage Department, is now carried on in the Arsenal to a great extent ; and for this purpose a great number of large shops have been built here since the year 1805, in which all the gun carriages for the army and navy are made. This important establishment is under the direction of a comptroller, or head inspector, assisted by two deputies. Some buildings forming a small quadrangle have been erected within the Arsenal for the Engineers Department. At this time (1811) we also read \u2014 The Commandant of the Garrison resides in the Arsenal, and the Lieutenant- Governor of the Academy, but there are now no barracks for soldiers. The whole extent of the Arsenal is now about a hundred and forty acres. The chief officers of the Arsenal are a storekeeper, clerk of the cheque, clerk of the survey, &c. The number of labourers employed in time of war, as at present, varies between 4,000 and 5,000* The Outer Wharf. \u2014 Below the canal the wharf, in its new exten sion, has been tbe growth of many years' accumulations of cinders and other refuse from the furnaces and workshops, and several acres of valuable surface have thus been reclaimed from the useless foreshore. The butts at tbe practice range, so long in use for proof and experimental purposes, are one more monument of prison labour, and much of the soil of which the mound is composed was dug from the surrounding marsh. The Practice Range. \u2014 Between 1850 and 1860 the inner range was commonly used for rocket and gun practice, but when the proof moved hither the outer range in the marshes was acquired and the practice butts built there. I clip the following paragraph, concerning the outer range, from a newspaper of \u2014 Sept. 1840. \u2014 The Ordnance authorities wish to obtain a more extensive practice range, the present one being so limited and in such close proximity to the river as to * In 1796, according to Lysons, there were about fifteen hundred men and three hundred boys employed in the Arsenal, and the convicts in addition. The making of canvas bags for the use of the Warren furnished employment also for many poor women."], [509, "347 WOOLWICH. be dangerous to the shipping. The intention is to continue the range eastwaid across the marshes toward Erith about three miles. Queer Fancies. \u2014 We have many amusing notions in the sug gestions our forefathers were accustomed to make in the exercise of that time-honoured custom, \" writing to the papers.\" One gentleman who visited Woolwich in 1798 thus delivered himself in the Gentle man's Magazine. Rejoicing at the escape the King's Ropeyard at Woolwich had from being destroyed by fire a few days ago, I was sorry to find how easily I was admitted into the Warren, by enquiring for a gentleman I might not even know or wish to see. When we consider how many disappointed and disaffected vagabonds are about this country, I think Government should be more vigilant. On my return the number of artificers entering the Warren surprised me. How easy a thing it is, said I to myself, to destroy this arsenal ! Should not every man wear a numbered badge, referring to a book describing his age and figure ; so that, when a suspected person enters, the sentry may assist to detect the fraud ? It would be easy for a man, knowing all or niost of the artificers, to sit at the gate during egress and ingress. This, with a parti cular jacket for the different branches in which they are employed, would go far towards detection. The Outer Boundaries.\u2014 Until 1844, the Arsenal was entirely in charge of the Military ; in that year, and for some vears after, the police and the sentries had joint custody. In 1861, all but a small guard of tbe Military were withdrawn, but not until 1880 were the police in absolute charge. This reference to the means of protection on tbe land-side brings us again to the wall. From the old maps it would seem that there was at first only a wooden fence about the Arsenal, and the earliest refer ence to a brick wall which I have met with is contained in an order to the Cadets by General Belford,* as follows : \u2014 1758. \u2014 If any cadet shall presume to go out of the Warren, either over the wall or any other way, after tattoo, he shall be punished and dismissed the regiment. The wall, however, was not then complete. When the before-men tioned extension took place, and tbe convicts were brought on thc scene, we read : \u2014 1777. Sept \u2014 The place where the convicts are now at Work near Woolwich Warren is enclosing on the Land Side with a Brick Wall, so that spectators will soon (if not already) be barred the Sight of those miserable Wretches on the Land Side except at a distance. A Pitiful Story. \u2014 A humorous illustration is in evidence regard ing this same wall in this same year. There were two of tbe Academy \" professors,\" quartered in the corner of the Warren next Plumstead Road, and one of them bad an outer door * It was this same governor who issued the order of Sth April, 1757, that, \"The first Cadet that is found swimming in the Thames shall be taken out naked, and put in the guard-room.\""], [510, "348 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. leading through the wall into the public thoroughfare, while the other had none. Consequently the professor minus the back door was an envious, discontented, and unhappy man, and he sent a plaintive letter to the Governor of the Academy, praying either that he too might have \u2022in outer door or the privilege of going through his neighbour's house. His sorrowful case must be set forth in his own words : \u2014 For want of such a ready communication with the town of AVoolwich, with regard to my family, I am subject to much inconvenience. For the way by the gate of the AVarren makes the distance to and from my house so great that I can't have the necessary provisions brought to me as other people have, by bakers, butchers, milkmen, &c, without great additional expense, and many not even for that at any rate. So that I am obliged to send my servants round about by all that way on all occasions to bring in all things necessary to the family. This is not the worst of it ; for all kinds of family necessaries not being constantly to be bought in the shops in such a place as AVoolwich, many things are brought only occasionally and cried about the streets, when it is a matter of no small grief that such things as may then be much wanted in the family can be heard to be cried immediately behind the house, without a possibility of coming at them, but by going half a mile round about, when perhaps the servants can be least spared to go ; and when they do go it is ten to one they are disappointed by the crier then being gone quite out of sight and hearing. And besides all this, it is not always that I can prevail on my good and sober female servants to lie willing so frequently to go through by the AVarren Gate, as it is next to an impossibility that such persons can pass so many soldiers as are generally there assembled without sometimes being subject to rencounters disagreeable to them. Why SO High ? \u2014 The AVarren wall was not more than eight feet high until 1804, when it was raised to its present height, A burglary committed at the officers' quarters, in 1803, is said to have been the immediate cause of this precaution, but tbe safe custody of the convicts and tbe protection of the Government stores were doubtless the prime motives. The Arsenal wall in its greatest elevation, along tbe Plum stead Road, is twenty feet high. In other parts it diminishes to fifteen feet, and in some to twelve feet. An Extinct Gate at Plumstead. \u2014 There are plain evidences in all men's sight of the old gate opposite Maxey Road. It was about ten feet wide and had an arch lofty enough to admit a loaded waggon. As tbe Storekeeper's house stands to the east, the Store Receiver's house stood to the west of this gate, but was pulled down about 1820. Old Borders. \u2014 Until 1857 the canal was the extreme boundary of the Arsenal, and the inner practice range was barely enclosed from Plumstead Road, a hedge and a five-barred gate being the only protec tion. Tbe extent of the older wall is plainly seen a little beyond tbe Storekeeper's house and garden, now occupied by the Storekeeper's successor, the Commissary-General of Ordnance."], [511, "349 WOOLAVICH. Cole \u00b1 lelds. \u2014 Until 1856 a triangular block of houses, known as Cole Fields, was wedged into the Government ground opposite Vicarage Road, having a road beside the receding wall from the main highway to the Canal, and this wall, which we can see from the top of the tram car, forms now an inner fence. Cole Fields boasted two taverns, tbe Dover Castle (now on the opposite side), and the British Flag, the fore runner of tbe Standard in Ann Street. The Arsenal gradually crept about and strangled old Cole Fields, but while the houses stood they seemed to proclaim a semi-public right to the land surrounding. The big lake which stood on the site of the cartridge factory, and the marsh \u2022ditches which ran up to the road, were free to all who chose to climb the gate or creep through the ill-kept hedge in tbe skating season. The cottages were pulled down and the Arsenal wall completed all round the Government enclosure (about two and a half miles) in 1857. Smuggling. \u2014 Until the wall was built, and tbe police were intro duced, many contraband practices were in vogue, and the following par ticulars under the head of \".The Woolwich Smuggling\" were published in a morning paper, concerning one of tbe Government vessels employed in conveying stores : \u2014 1816. March 30th. \u2014 On the voyage home, a carpenter employed in securing the packages discovered the secret. Immediately on arrival he gave information at the Custom House, but it was ten days more before the ship was inspected ; in the meantime much of the smuggled goods for certain persons were got away, and only those were left for men of less note \u2014 there were to the value of \u00a37,000 for one man, packed up as \" return Congreve rockets.\" There were many rare things which were got out of the way. In the mortars were laces, gloves, cambrics, &c, and in the tumbrils were claret, champagne, &c. Many people have long supplied themselves and friends with wine in this way, and their wives with finery. This is the only vessel which has been detected, but the trade has long and successfully been carried on to a great extent. The man who informed got about \u00a31 ,000. The Main Gate. \u2014 On the gates of the Royal Arsenal facing Beresford Square will be found displayed the letter \"B.\" This is in honour of Lord Beresford, by whom the new entrance was made in 1829, as the following inscription on the inner wall of the staircase under the bell turret will show : This Entrance to the Royal Arsenal was planned, and the Gateway constructed by order of General Viscount Beresford, G.C.B., G.C.H., Master-General of the Ordnance, in the tenth Year of the Reign of His Majesty King George IA7\". a.d. 1829. The former main gate was at the entrance to Rope Yard Rails, in"], [512, "RECORDS OF THE AVOOLWICH DISTRICT. 350 the first panel of the wall, west of tbe police offices. One of the two blocked-up archways within the Arsenal will be found to correspond with this position. The Bell. \u2014 On Jan. 3, 1861, the bell at these gates, which was said to have done duty ever since tbe works began, became cracked. Its place was supplied by a new one cast in the Gun Foundry, and this also cracked in the year 1886. The new bell was cast by a private firm, and bung in 1887, in which year a bell was also fixed at the Lower Plumstead Gate. Precautions. \u2014 In contrast with the want of caution exhibited in 1798 there appears to have been an excess of zeal in 1840, as the paragraph which follows will explain : \u2014 1840. October 14th. \u2014 It is pretty generally known that previous to the fires taking place in the dockyards, the public were suffered to enter the Royal Arsenal and go wherever their curiosity led them. Within the last few days, however, the various storehouses have been closed, and the public are now merely allowed to walk along a portion of the roads which are under the immediate notice of the soldiers of the Royal Artillery. Upon entering the gates, the visitors are conducted into the lodge on the left, where a corporal of the Royal Artillery enters their names in a book, and after wards proceeds with them to the officer's room in the guard-house, from whom he obtains a card, upon which are the following instructions : \" Royal Arsenal, AVool wich, No. 2. Permit this party to pass round the Arsenal. They are not to go into any building without asking the permission of the head of the department under whose charge it is. To prevent inconvenience to themselves, the parties are to keep the broad roads as dotted on the plan on the other side.\" Upon the reverse side of the card is an ink-line showing the route, and at each angle of the prescribed boun dary an artillery-man is placed. The visitors are not permitted to go as far as the convict hulk, and cannot pass eastward of the foundry, boring mill, laboratory, store houses, or carriage department, all oi' which are closed against the public. These extreme precautions appeared to be justified by some alarming occurrences, but they did not continue for many years.* The present system of almost unrestrained liberty to all visitors provided with cards from tbe War Office has been in unvaried operation for nearly forty years, into which period tbe whole life of the Royal Arsenal as it is known to this generation may be conveniently compressed. Watering Time. \u2014 One last relic of old times and we will enter on the new era: \u2014 1829. \u2014 In this year the privilege of \"watering time\" was abolished. Hitherto half an hour in the morning and half an hour in the afternoon were allowed for refreshments in all departments of the Royal Arsenal, and beer was brought in by the potmen from the public-houses. * Vigilance was briefly renewed when the Campcrdown exploded in the Thames on the 12th July, 1843.

Sir John Anderson. \u2014 One who had an early hand and a promi nent part in the reformation of the Royal Arsenal, during that momen tous crisis, the war with Russia in 1854-5, was Mr. (afterwards Dr. and Sir) John Anderson. By him was presented to Parliament, on the Sth of May, 1856, a \" General Statement of Past and Present Condition of the several Manufacturing Branches of the \"War Department,\" and of this I give the following slightly abbreviated version : \u2014 Up to 1842 the machinery in the Royal Gun Factory was almost as antiquated as the buildings. The three great boring mills, moved by horses, which were imported in 1780, as modern, from the Hague, were the only engines used in making Her Majesty's ordnance until fifteen years ago. The more modern departments, known as the Royal Carriage Factory and the Laboratory, have flourished during the present century in an unequal degree. For fifty years the former has been more or less in a high state of efficiency through the introduction of machinery from the workshops of Bramah and Maudslay and the contrivances of Bentham and Sir I. Brunei. The improvements due to their genius rendered the department highly efficient during the French war, but it was not until 1847 that symptoms of renewed life were manifested under the able superintendence of General Gordon, and still later of Colonel Colquhoun. The Laboratory during the same period appears to have remained quite stationary, and up to 1853 was far inferior to that of any third-rate z 2"], [516, "352 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Power. ... On the outbreak of the Russian war there were not shells enough in the Arsenal to furnish forth the first battering train that went to the East, and the fuzes were of the date of Waterloo. As the war proceeded the Ordnance were at their wits'-end for coarse-grained gunpowder. . . . We were obliged to go to Liege for 44,000 Minie guns, 3,000 cavalry swords, and 12,000 barrels of powder, and to the United States for 20,000 barrels more. Money no object. The want of machinery was the difficulty. The sheila for the Baltic fleet alone, which had to be fabricated by private manufacturers, cost upwards of .\u00a3100,000 more than they would have done had they been made by the new machinery lately introduced into the Royal Arsenal. The Government were charged by the contractors ,\u00a373 per ton for six-pounder diaphragm sheila, now made in the Royal Laboratory for ,\u00a314 19s. 2d. per ton. These demands and the rapid drain of stores led the War Department to consider whether it would not be better to organize a Government establiahment on a larger EnAeld Small Arms Factory. scale and better system. A very large number of ingenious machines were procured from America, and others were procured from the Continent and at home. In a very short time a powerful factory of munitions of war sprang into life. Within three years factories sprang up on either side. . . . Fourteen pieces of brass ordnance can now be turned out weekly, and the fine building recently erected* is intended for the manufacture of iron ordnance which has hitherto been produced exclusively by private manufacturers. Had we possessed reliable guns in the late campaign, the destruction of Cronstadt and Sevastopol would have only formed the work of a few days. No less than seventeen of the thirteen-inch mortars were destroyed by the want of tenacity in the iron. . . . The want of shells induced the authorities to permit Captain Boxer to erect a model factory of shells in the autumn of 1855. This he did with surprising rapidity. The success of the experiment led to the erection of the splendid shell foundry which is now attached to the Arsenal. But where is the Small Arms Factory?

The eminent chemist of the War Department, speak ing to the Foremen's Association in 1885, said that when he joined the Arsenal in 1849 \u2014 It consisted chiefly of the Dial Square, in which the Dutch first cast the English guns (and in which the Dutch method was even then being carried on) with one or two small buildings on the site of the Carriage Department, having in their midst that wonderful old tool made by Bramah, which every one went to see. Farther on was a long tract of ground covered with guns, mostly old cannon and carronades, past service and condemned, but a marvellous eight for strangers to see. Shortly afterwards came the Russian war, and while they were arming the troops in the Crimea they built the Royal Arsenal\u2014 including the main factory of the Laboratory, the Cap Factory, the Shell Foundry and the Royal Gun Factory, or, as it was called, the Armstrong Factory. They not only cast their own guns, but imported machinery from America and elsewhere, and began to improve the style of their ordnance. The Small Arms Factory at Enfield was at the same time developed, and everybody was delighted with the progress those few years had made. Growth of the Arsenal. \u2014 Each of the manufacturing depart- ments has continued and continues to grow. The Laboratory and Gun Factory, having secured a footing on the eastern outskirts, are pushing out new branches, the latter surrounding itself with additional forges and turneries, while the former has taken several flights and settled down, in isolated spots, its east laboratory or composition buildings, its boys' (formerly girls') cartridge factory, its cannon cartridge works, and more recently its torpedo factory. The Carriage Department, being restricted, has grown within itself, and been marvellously improved internally. Until 1848 a roadway occupied the site of the scrap forge, and divided the Carriage Square from the Engineer Square, but in that * The Inspector ol Machinery was John Anderson himecls, and he was always desirous of having all the Government works under one head and located at Wool wich."], [520, "354 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. year the erection of the forge united the two in one block, and soon afterwards the whole of the premises was given over to the department. A little later other open spots were roofed in to form workshops, the main road to the south being thus possessed in 1886-7, and within the last few years many of the partition walls have been removed, converting all the shops into one and forming the spacious factory which now exists. The separate building known as the mounting ground* and the departmental officest and drawing offices were erected about 1854, and the rest of the old shot ground which stood in front of the shell foundry was taken in for other buildings in 1885. The splendid model room in the south side of \"the Square\" was built about the same time as the aforesaid offices. The old saw-mill, part of which remains, has stood since 1812. The new buildings have banished beyond the canal most of the old guns which formerly were a feature of the Arsenal, and the piles of spherical shot have almost disappeared. In 1850 it was reported that there were in the Royal Arsenal twenty-four thousand pieces of ordnance, three thousand being of gun metal, and twenty-one thousand of iron. The weight of the largest gun cast at that time was, as in 1837, ninety hundredweight. The Armstrong Gun Factory. \u2014 When the Royal Gun Factories were built in 1854-5 for the manufacture of the wrought-iron ordnance invented by Mr. (now Sir William) Armstrong, he was appointed Superintendent of the works. The tower which stands beside the bisecting road supported one side of a fine brick arch, since removed, and was intended for a clock tower. The clock is said to have been manufactured in London and to have had four faces, each nine feet in diameter, with hands respectively four and six feet long. But it was never put into its intended place, and the tower is useless except as an illustration of frustrated aims. Improved Guns. \u2014 The introduction of rifled cannon dates from 1860. On January 4th of that year the first rifled guns were turned out at the Rifled Ordnance Factory, and on November 7th following the first heavy Armstrong (100 pdr.) breechloader was proved at the Royal Arsenal. * The large shed which covered the mounting ground was destroyed in a snow storm at Christmas, 1886, and was rebuilt of stronger materials. It was handed over to the inspection branch at the reorganization in 1888. t In \"Recollections of Woolwich,\" an unpretending work published by Mr. R. E. White in 18S5, it is stated that the Carriage Department Office was formerly in the building now occupied by the Inspector of Machinery at the Rookery, and subse quently in the Engineer Office, now devoted to the Volunteers ; the Gun Factory Office was at the corner of the brass foundry, now the Audit Office ; and the Laboratory Office was in the Laboratory Square. *"], [521, "WOOLWICH. 355 War With Eu.8ia.-The time of the great Russian war was a ime of marvellous changes at Woolwich, and during its hei-hT ten thousand men and boys were employed in the Royal Arsenal ,1 number exceeded only by very recent years and under extraordinary circumstances. The most rapid advance that the Arsenal has ever experienced was developed during the continuance of this campaio-n Inventors -The whole nation was affected by the war fever, and projectors of all kinds (clergymen included) devoted their ener-ies to tne invention of new implements of destruction. Close upon two thousand suggested improvements in artillery were examined by the Ordnance Select Committee in 1854-5. Some proposed to fill shells with cayenne pepper, chloroform and cacodyle, a most virulent con- trivance for poisoning the air. Only thirty of all these proposals were ever adopted, one of which was a plan of filling shells with liquid iron, which, in the first experiment, destroyed the new butt which had just been erected below the canal at a cost of \u00a3200. Another was the great Mallet mortar, hooped like a barrel, which threw a shell of three feet diameter, and containing 200 lbs. of powder. When fired in the marshes the shells descended with such force that some of them could not be found by digging and probing twenty-five feet deep, and the artillerymen surmised that they had gone to Australia ! But the mortar proved incapable of sustaining the moderate charge of 75 lbs. of powder, and it stands in the Arsenal now, a conspicuous monument of courageous but misdirected enterprise. Mr. Francis Pellatt. \u2014 While the war lasted and all the manufac- turing departments were undergoing a process, practically, of recon- struction, the Ordnance (or Storekeeper's) department was on its first important trial. Mr. Francis Pellatt, a gentleman of great ability and a most popular official, was selected by Lord Palmerston at this juncture to direct the department, which he did, under trying difficulties, with remarkable success. Mr. Pellatt had entered the department when a lad, and his life was one of constant advancement, during which he was always known as the workman's friend, but was nevertheless a most diligent and faithful servant of the Crown. In early life he was em- ployed abroad, and was next attached to the Carriage Department, in which, on the retirement of Mr. Grinton, he became chief clerk, and then storekeeper. The Crimean war gave his powers of administration full play, and he was at the height of his prosperity when an unfortunate accident cut short his career and plunged the whole community into sorrow and mourning. On Monday, May 31st, 1858, he was driving a cob-phaeton down TNew Road, having Mrs. Pellatt with him, when a puff of steam from the railway frightened the animal, which bolted, and, in turning the corner of Plumstead Road, upset the carriage."], [522, "356 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Mr. Pellatt sustained such injuries that, after remaining in Dr. Cole man's surgery for two days, he died unconscious, at the age of forty seven years. His wife was also seriously hurt, but recovered. The deceased gentleman held the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, and was buried with military honours in Plumstead Churchyard, the Arsenal workpeople attending en masse to mourn their \" friend.\" Later Days. \u2014 The later records of the Royal Arsenal deal chiefly with the visits of distinguished personages, productions more or less remarkable of warlike goods, and some lamentable misadventures. Queen Victoria. \u2014 Of Royal visits we have only two occasions to mention in which Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria has honoured Woolwich since the sad death of the Prince Consort, and on both these occasions Her Majesty merely passed through on her way to the Continent. Neither was consequently a public event, and would not call for particular mention but for an absurd feature of the second visit which has become historical. A Case of Over-zeal. \u2014 The earlier of these two embarkations took place at the Dockyard, and certain officials fell into disgrace for admit ting a visitor or two after an order had been issued that the Queen wished for strict privacy. Warned probably by this example, the officer who was at the head of the Royal Arsenal resolved when he received a similar order to obey it to the letter, and in the end got snubbed for his excessive pains. The Queen's departure took place from the T-pier of the Arsenal on the afternoon of Tuesday, August llth, 1864, and this time the privacy was quite painful. The report before us says that the roads all the way from London were crowded with people, that police constables were placed at intervals along the whole distance, and that two mounted patrols, \" wearing the new helmet which is to be adopted as the head-dress of all the Metropolitan police,\" rode in front, the only semblance of authority. The carriage was closed, but Her Majesty bowed from the windows in response to the respectful salutations of her people. The Arsenal was as silent as a cemetery. Except the police and the soldiers on guard not a living soul was to be seen. The clerks and workmen had been forbidden under fearful penalties even to look out of or approach the windows, and all the workmen were withdrawn from the wharves hours before. The* families residing in the Arsenal were enjoined to keep indoors, and four or five officials on the pier were all the persons Her Majesty saw till 6he got on board her yacht. It was afterwards stated that the Queen was much displeased when she came to hear of all this fuss, Her Majesty's only desire having been to avoid unnecessary ceremony and a multitude of people."], [523, ""], [524, "PLATE XXXIX The Thunderer Gun Experiments. To face page 357.]"], [525, "WOOLWICH. 357 The Girls Factory.*\u2014 Since the Crimean war, the Royal Arsenal has seen some fluctuations, but few, if important, changes. Among the latter is the discontinuance of female labour. In one of the large workshops beyond the canal-then known as the Girls' Factory, but now the Cartridge Factory, and filled with boys\u2014 several hundred girls were employed for a series of years making cartridges, under Mrs. Mabbett, as shown m the sketch at the head of this chapter. In March, 1872, they were all dismissed, and no girls have since been employed. Recent events are a little out of place in this historical chapter, and I have no intention of following them. The most momentous are those which have originated in the public inquiries, due to certain charges made, in 1886, under the name of \" the Ordnance Scandals,\" which, though they proved utterly untrue, have led to the reorganization of the departments on an improved foundation, as will be presently shown. The \" Thunderer\" Gun Trials.\u2014 Even the experiments which are on the \" Records \" would require several volumes for their proper narration, and must therefore be passed by, but I may make an exception of the Thunderer gun incident, because of the interest which it excited, and the important bearing which it had upon the reputation and prosperity of the Royal Arsenal. In 1878-9 breech-loading slowly began to supersede the Woolwich muzzle-loading system, and the advocates of rival patterns began the crusade of criticisms which lasted for years after. Just at this crisis, on January 2nd, 1879, one of the two 38-ton muzzle-loaders on board of H. M.S. Thunderer burst during practice in the Mediterranean, and an avalanche of censures descended upon the heads of the War Office and its advisers. The officials denied that the explosion was due to any fault of the gun, and at once declared that it must have been caused by double loading. A long inquiry took place, followed by many experiments, in which all sorts of attempts were made to burst the sister gun, which was brought home to Woolwich from the Thunderer, until at length, on February 3rd, 1880, the gun was double loaded, and burst almost precisely as the other had burst thirteen months before. The experiments took place in a bomb- proof cell, specially constructed, opposite the proof-butts at the Royal Arsenal. New Berber. \u2014 In 1886, the railway plant which was purchased for the proposed desert-line from Suakim to Berber, together with the water-pipes which were to have been laid over the same tract of sand, and a variety of other stores from Egypt, were deposited upon a large area of the marsh-land, enclosed within a fence, and forthwith named \" New Berber.\""], [526, "358 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Powder Magazines. \u2014 -Berber\" was handed over to the charge of the Royal Arsenal police, and soon afterwards the magazines in the marshes were also transferred from military to police custody. This change was brought about mainly by the panics to which young sentries had given way at their lonely posts, in one of which a private belonging to the Welsh Regiment of Infantry had killed a comrade with a bayonet, mistaking him in the darkness for a dynamitard, while guarding the Gun Cotton Magazine at the end of the Harrow Manor way. The police station on the Magazine premises was occupied and the sentries withdrawn on November 24th, 1886."], [527, "Convict Hulk off Warren Lai CHAPTER XXXII THE CONVICT PERIOD Punishment by Contract. \u2014 Of all the changes which have happened to Woolwich the one attended with the greatest blessing was the abolition of the convict establishment from the Royal Arsenal. Convict hulks were established by Act of Parliament in 1776, prior to which, felons under long sentence were all punished by transportation. Eighty years of Woolwich history, prior to 1856, is thus strongly flavoured with incidents and adventures connected with the criminals here imprisoned on board the ships in the river. These vessels, called \" the hulks,\" were moored off the Dockyard and Arsenal, and were originally farmed by a contractor ; Mr. Duncan Campbell, who was a well-known man of his time, undertaking their maintenance and safe custody for a consideration which the Government readily conceded, in order to be rid of tbe trouble. * So long, however, as the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, the hulks have been strictly national institutions under Government management, and, so far as we remember them, were named the Warrior, the Justitia, and the Defence. The Justitia, the accompanying sketch of which was made in 1849, lay nearly opposite Warren Lane, having the hospital ship in a line up river. * In a pamphlet published in 1782, entitled \" Hints for the Regulation of the Convicts in the Hulks off Woolwich and other Places,\" it is stated that the first contract when the hulks were provided was at the rate of \u00a332 for each convict per annum, and that it was afterwards reduced to \u00a326."], [528, "360 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Convict Labour. \u2014 The original purpose of the convicts being brought to Woolwich was the utilisation of their labour in the ex tension works at the Dockyard and Arsenal, and they were for many years so employed. The contractor appears to have done the work very well until, for economy's sake, a Government was found bold enough to take it in hand. When the extension works were finished, the convicts were put to work as labourers in the Yard and Arsenal, but this proved unsatisfactory in many ways, and at length, in 1856, they were all taken away to Chatham and other places, where there was work to do of more appropriate kind. The digging and removal of earth is always found the most suitable labour for convicts, and while they were at Woolwich, gangs of the prisoners were occasionally employed on such jobs outside the walls of the Government works, as, for instance, in 1848, when they excavated the circular reservoir at the summit of Woolwich Common. Inhabitants of that date may remember them shuffling along New Road, to and from their work, all tethered to a single chain. The hulks were removed from the Dockyard some years before they disappeared from the Arsenal, which had long been their headquarters. The Hulks. \u2014 A report upon the subject was published, July 15th, 1776, in one of the magazines, the hulks having at that time been just established. The writer says : \u2014 The law for sentencing the convicts to work upon the Thames is indeed severe, but we trust it will be salutary. They are to be employed in as much labour as they can sustain, to be fed with legs and shins of beef, ox cheek, and such other coarse food ; to have nothing for drink but water or small beer ; to be clad in some squalid uniform ; never to be visited without the consent of the overseers ; and whoever gives them the smallest relief incurs a penalty of forty shillings. The expense of keeping and maintaining them is to be paid by Government, and not out of the county rates. The first vessel launched for the above purpose was constructed on a plan approved of by his Majesty in council. It cannot be called a ship or tender, neither is it so flat or open as a lighter ; it is calculated to hold twenty-seven tons of ballast. On the larboard side the gunwale is considerably broader than in the common lighters ; on the starboard side is a flooring about three feet broad, for the men to work on, and a machine' called a david* with a windlass, for raising the ballast. Part of the vessel is decked in abaft, for the convicts to sleep in, and another in the forecastle is formed into a kind of cabin for the overseer. Her outward appearance differs very little from that of a common lighter, t On the 5th of August, the convicts, chained by the leg, two and two, began to work in her, about two miles below Barking Creek, under the direction of Duncan Campbell, Esq., who has been appointed the governor of this new kind of Bridewell. Their behaviour, in general, since they came on board her, and other lighters employed in the same service, has been very becoming ; the clause in the Act which says that the time for which they * Vernacular, \"davit.\" t This description applies, not to the hulks, which were simply the hulls of old war-ehips, but to the barges employed for dredging."], [529, ""], [530, "Convicts constructing Embankment of the Warren, 1779.

Convict News. \u2014 The following are newspaper cuttings relating to this subject : \u2014 1777. The heads of the oxen slaughtered on Tower Hill are daily sent down to Woolwich hulks for the convicts. 1777. April 23rd.\u2014 One day last week the ballast lighter working on the Essex coast was drove over the river to Woolwich by the high wind, w*hen fourteen of the convicts rose upon their keepers, cut one of them terribly in the shoulder and made their escape. A naval officer, meeting them at Greenwich, persuaded eight to return to their duty, but the other six have not since been heard of. 1777. December 1. \u2014 Last week one of the convicts at Woolwich, being at work on shore, concealed himself amongst some rushes, and in the night got in at the chamber window of a gardener in that town, and stole some plate, wearing apparel, and other things : but the gardener's wife, hearing him, alarmed her husband, who pursued and took him. He was carried on board the ballast lighter and severely flogged . 1780. \u2014 The convicts at Woolwich are now employed in making a new wharf at the Warren, opposite to where the hulks lay, for the purpose of the Ordnance hoys load ing and unloading, which they at present are obliged to do above the Warren, a practice attended with great inconvenience. Building the Arsenal Wharf. \u2014 This scene is illustrated in the picture on the opposite page, which is copied on a small scale from a large and rare engraving published in 1779.

They were well clad, and, by then appearance, seemed well fed ; but, in general, the sense of shame was lost. If they had any at first, it soon is changed into hardened impudence, by the depravity of their fellow prisoners. At this time there were about three hundred busied on land, besides others who are employed on the shoals of the river in the ballast lighters. At night they are all lodged on board four great hulks. Notable Escapes. \u2014 A little of the nervousness with which the inhabitants were wont to regard their unpleasant neighbours may be reasonably excused, for, if we do not hear of any serious crimes com mitted by the felons, they provided occasional excitements of severe impressiveness. In the Annual Register, under date of Thursday, June 27th, 1805, it is thus recorded : \u2014 This day five of the convicts on board the hulks at Woolwich endeavoured to make their escape in a boat. They were pursued, and not surrendering, were fired at. Two were shot dead, and another was so much wounded that he soon died. The other two were taken unhurt. Similar attempts were frequent, a few successes, but mostly failures. The following are reports taken from old newspapers : \u2014 1832. November.\u2014 On Saturday, as a gang of twenty-four convicts employed in the Arsenal were going to work, twelve of the number attempted to escape, by jumping over a very high hedge, which divides the marshes from the high road. The sentinel immediately fired, bringing back eight of the number, the other four continuing their flight towards Plumstead Common. The artillery on duty in the Arsenal, accom panied by a number of villagers, went in pursuit, and found two of the fugitives con cealed in a quickset hedge in a secluded spot behind the mill on Plumstead Common. They had taken off their shirts and pulled them over their jackets, and pulled their stockings over the irons on their legs. The other two were found behind a haystack between Wickham and Welling. 1837. May Sth. \u2014 On Saturday afternoon a party of convicts, employed in Wool wich Dockyard in charge of an officer and military sentinel, four most determined characters, named Boutel, Wallace, Dalton, and Bannon, suddenly rushed upon the sentinel, a rifleman, on duty at the west gate, and forcibly took away his rifle. On one of the officers approaching, Boutel, who had the rifle, swore to blow his brains out, and all four made their escape by scaling the gate. On breaking into the London Road, the convicts betook themselves to the brickfields on the other side. Their ignorance of the localities induced them to climb a steep hill on the centre of Charlton sandpits, flunking it was part of the hanging wood, but, finding a ravine of great depth intervened between them and the only spot by which they could expect to escape, they rapidly descended in full view of the excavators into the pits. Boutel, abandoning the rifle to Bannon, heavily chained as he was, and compelled to employ one hand in holding up his fetters, squatted down, and folding his arms over his knees, rolled himself, bounding like a ball, down a steep precipice full eighty feet deep, without sustaining any injury. Dalton took a. line up the face of the ascent to the hanging wood ; the others passed through an orchard and some gardens, greatly alarming the inhabitants of that rural and retired spot, Woodland Place, who shut themselves in and watched the chase, as the yagers followed, discharging several shots without effect. Captain Grove, observing that the convicts were taking different directions, extended his men, and in this way Wallace was captured. The others gained the summit of the hill, crossed a bridle road, and struck into a close shaw of"], [533, "WOOLWICH. 363 underwood and furze, and when the troops attained the summit, the convicts were not to be seen. A tinker in the bridle road refused to .give any tidings of them, but intelligence was obtained from two boys, and the bugle sounded to encompass this part of the wood. If they had been a hundred instead of three, thev must all have been captured in the lessening circle, and the villains were dragged from their lurki,,*. places, the rifle-piece recovered, and they were marched back to Woolwich. On board the hulks they were severely flogged. In October, 1833, a remonstrance was made to Lord Melbourne on the subject of the transmission of convicts by thc stage coaches which ran between London and Woolwich, and subsequently the prisoners were brought down in special conveyances, generally by water. Prison Fever, \u2014 The health of the convict establishment was generally bad, due no doubt to overcrowding, the proximity of the marshes, and the harsh conditions of prison life. For some years prior to 1840 there was a frequent outbreak of fever, and as an inquest had to be held on every prisoner who died, the public was much scandalized by the excessive mortality among the miserable creatures. Strange Verdict. \u2014 On the 29th of December, 1840, an inquest was held at the Salutation, Woolwich, on the bodies of no fewer than seven convicts, but the jury returned the strange verdict of \" Died by the visitation of God of fever.\" Old Woolwich juries seemed to have found this form of verdict convenient in all cases of difficulty. Even when a soldier was flogged to death, the authorities were relieved of their responsibility by the jury's declaration that death resulted, not from the lashes, but from \" The visitation of God.\" The fees which were then allowed to coroners' juries may have helped to make them complacent, but could scarcely have enhanced their sense of a solemn duty. A Queer Joke. \u2014 For example, we find in the police court deposi tions the following case : \u2014 1831. January 2nd. \u2014 John Lowe, a butcher, was charged with administering a drug to a jury at the Chatham Arms. After an inquest on three convicts who died at the hulks, the jury received the county allowance of twenty shillings and ordered eight pounds of beef steaks, and each had a glass of grog. John Lowe was journeyman to Mr. Campion, butcher. It was proved that he bought twopenny worth of tartaric acid, and that he was about the kitchen when the steak was cooked. All the jurymen were immediately and simultaneously ill, and the prisoner was arrested and kept for a time in custody on suspicion, but the worst supposition was that he had played a daring and dangerous pract.cal joke, and, as the victims recovered, he was released. At this time the cmvicts were employed both in the Dockyard and Arsenal, and a paragraph of October 10th, 1835, says : \u2014 The convicts in the Arsenal are employed beating the rust off the shot and shells."], [534, "364 RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT. Disasters. \u2014 During the later part of their stay here, when they did the work of ordinary labourers in the workshops both at the Arsenal and the Dockyard, I have some horrible recollections of inquests at both places on unlucky convicts, whose bodies were accidentally severed in twain by the circular saw. While they were stationed at thc Dockyard, the following midnight incident occurred ; \u2014 1839. 21st March. \u2014 About half-past 12 A.M. on Monday, an alarm was given in Woolwich Dockyard that the \" Ganymede \" convict ship, with about three hundred Convicts cleaning shot. men battened under hatches, had capsized. The mud and water were fast filling the cabins when means of egress w*ere found, and the convicts, who behaved well, were got out drenched to the skin. The vessel had fallen on her bilge through part of her moorings having given way. Exodus. \u2014 Since our convict establishments were broken up at AVoolwich, and prisoners under sentence more usefully employed upon the works at Chatham, and Dover, and elsewhere, Woolwich has been more happily and profitably served by free labour."], [535, "CHAPTER XXXIII. THE ORDNANCE DEPARTMENTS. Ihfc Sister Works.\u2014 The Royal Arsenal having become virtually the emporium of all the warlike arts, and its name the generic term for all the factories of arms and] ammunition, I may introduce its satellites. Associated under one chief, and closely connected in many ways, the Royal Arsenal and the establishments at Enfield and Waltham Abbey are more than sisters \u2014 they are practically consolidated as the separate branches of one concern in the production of the national munitions, and would have been, but for reasons of policy, all combined at Wool wich. Like the Arsenal, they owe their development to the war wth Russia. Enfield Small- Arms Factory.\u2014 It was in 1854 that the Govern ment decided, on the recommendation of a committee, to establish a manufactory of small arms to a limited extent, under the direction of the Board of Ordnance, and the House of Commons voted .\u00a3150,000 for the experiment. Prior to that time, all our rifles were manufactured by private firms, chiefly at Birmingham, but in times of emergency we had often to seek aid from foreigners. It is true that a small Govern ment factory had existed at Enfield Lock since the early part of the cen tury, and that every year a few thousand muskets were there turned out by hand, but, as we have seen by the report of Sir John Anderson, there was at one time an idea of absorbing the Enfield works in the Royal Arsenal, and establishing the national small-arms factory as one of its departments. Other counsels, however, prevailed, and on a narrow strip of land hemmed round bjT the little river Lea, the Royal Small-arms Factory was built in 1855-6. Since then, other workshops have been added ; and the land enclosed, including the practice butt, covers forty acres. At first the factory was under the supervision of Mr. Parkins, the manager, but from 1872 it has had, like the other factories, a military super intendent. The average annual output is about 60,000 rifles, 5,000 pistols, and 8,000 swords or bayonets ; but the resources are such that the rate of production could easily be advanced to 150,000 stand of arms.

As a Government establishment they are only of recent importance, but a powder factory has existed on the spot since 1684. The stream here separates into several canals and sidings, making in all ten miles of water, and the whole area forms a miniature Venice or Amsterdam. On its many islands and promontories the various sheds and works are disposed at discreet distances apart, surrounded and divided by thick groves of alder, willow and dogwood trees, the timber of which makes good charcoal for explosive uses.

The Impulse of 1885. \u2014 In 1885 the Royal Arsenal received the most healthy and enduring of its many impulses, consequent on the sudden discovery that the national defences were not in the state which befitted a great maritime power, and a determination to put the navy and the coaling stations into a condition of permanent efficiency. This necessitated not only a considerable augmentation of strength in the Royal Arsenal, but also the employment of night-workers, or \"shifts,\" and a general resort to overtime for more than twelve months at a stretch. Envy and. Enmity. \u2014 The consequent prosperity of Woolwich at a time when trade generally throughout the country was depressed speedily attracted covetous eyes towards the Royal Arsenal, and the representatives of various interests were not slow in Parliament and elsewhere to fall foul of the Ordnance Departments on all sorts of pre tences. Protests were made against the overtime system, which was said to prevent the fair distribution of labour, and in 1886, the Secretary of State for War yielded to remonstrances, and ordered that overtime should cease. The following statement, which is, like all the figures which follow, official, will show the extent to which night work and overtime had been resorted to in the three manufacturing depart ments. 12 Between 1848 and 1850 there were\" several medical officers who took duty in the Royal Arsenal for short and broken periods. 13 Previously Assistants."], [543, "WOOLWICH. 371 Accusations and Inquisitions.\u2014 A natural effect of the accusa tions made in Parliament and the Press was to create a feeling of uneasiness and distrust throughout the country, and at length certain charges were formulated, and a series of inquiries were instituted. The chief of these was the work of a Parliamentary Committee appointed to inquire into the organization and administration of the manufacturing departments, and the Committee was under the presidency of the Earl of Morley. Their investigations were long and searching, and in the end, they reported that the charges which had been preferred were false, but they recommended certain changes in organization and administration, amongst which was the appointment, as before mentioned, of a supreme head. Eardley Maitland. \u2014 The choice of tie Queen's advisers fell upon Colonel Eardley Maitland, C.B., Royal Artillery, who, with the title of Director- General of Ordnance Factories, and the rank of Major-General, took up his appointment on November 1st, 1887. His command embraces all the manufacturing establishments at Woolwich, Enfield, Waltham Abbey, Birmingham, &c, and he is directly under the authority of the Secretary of State for War, the office of Surveyor of Ordnance being abolished, and the Director of Artillery transferred to the military side of the War Establish ment.

Consolidation. \u2014 Although the consolidation of the whole of the departments under the one head commenced in November, 1887, it did not fully take effect until the beginning of the following financial year, April lst, 1888. The whole of the superintendents of departments at Woolwich, Enfield, Waltham Abbey, and Birmingham, with the clerks and managers, office keepers, messengers, electricians, railway men, &c., were then included in the Director-General's staff, and the whole of the Works Department, medical establishment, and other isolated institutions, were also attached to, and absorbed by, his office. The sum of \u00a33,000 was voted by Parliament in 1888 to provide the building in which the work of the Director- General is carried on. Inspection. \u2014 A separate inspection of stores, whether supplied by the Ordnance Factories or by contractors, was instituted on March 1st, 1888, in accordance with the recommendation of Lord Morley's Com mittee of 1887. Its establishment as approved consisted of one chief inspector for small arms at \u00a3800, twelve inspectors at from \u00a3455 to \u00a3582 for guns, carriages, ammunition, &c, and five inspectors at \u00a3250 to \u00a3300 for harness, saddlery, and other stores. There is also an inspector for machinery at \u00a3000, and the chemical and photographic establishment, being essentially an inspection department, was trans ferred entirely to the new office. The inspectors and proof officers at Woolwich (under Col. C. Morley, TR.A., Assistant-Director of Artillery) are : \u2014 Laboratory Stores : Inspector, Captain C. F.
