' Sir Kenrick would be a splendid match for her, said the Vicar's wife. ' As poor as Job, and as proud as Lucifer,' re torted the Vicar, without lifting his eyes from a volume of his favourite Bishop Berkeley. It was the Vicar's way in these tete-a-tete con versations by the domestic hearth. He read, and his wife talked to him. He could keep his atten tion on the most intricate chain of argument, and yet never answer Mrs. Dulcimer's speculative asser tions or vague questionings away from the purpose. VOL. I. B"], [10, "2 AN OPEN VERDICT. This was the happy result of long habit. The Vicar loved his books, and his wife loved the ex ercise of her tongue. His morning hours were sacred. He studied or read as he pleased till dinner time, secure from feminine interruption. But the evening was a privileged time for Mrs. Dulcimer. She brought a big workbasket, like an inverted beehive, into the library directly after dinner, and established herself in the arm-chair opposite the Vicar's, ready for a comfortable chat. A comfort able chat meant a vivacious monologue, with an occasional remark from Mr. Dulcimer, who came in now and then like a chorus. He had his open book on the reading easel attached to his chair, and turned the leaves with a languid air, some times as if out of mere absence of mind ; but he was deep in philosophy, or metaphysics, or theology, or antiquarianism, for the greater part of his time; and his inward ear was listening to the mystic voices of the dead, while his outward ear gave respectful attention to Mrs. Dulcimer's critical observations upon the living. ' As poor as Job, and as proud as Lucifer,'"], [11, "3 MRS. DULCIMER HAS HER VIEWS. repeated the Vicar, with his eye upon a stiffish passage in Berkeley. 'I call it a proper pride,' said Mrs. Dulcimer. ' And as for poverty, she would have money enough for both. And then he has the estate.' ' Mortgaged up to the hilt.' ' And the title.' 'Now do you really believe, Selina, that those three letters of the alphabet, S I R, prefixed to a man's name, can give him the smallest possible distinction in the estimate of any of his fellow creatures not lunatic ? ' 'What is the use of talking in that hisdi and mighty way, Clement ? I know that Mary Turner, an insignificant little thing with red hair and a speckly skin, who was at school with me at the Misses Turk's, at Great Yafford, was very much looked up to by all the girls because her uncle was a baronet. He lived a long way off, and he never took any notice of her, that we could find out ; but he was a baronet, and we all felt as if there was a differ ence in her on that account. I don't pretend to say that we were not very ridiculous for thinking"], [12, "4 AN OPEN VERDICT. so, but still you know a school is only the world in little \u2014 and the world sets a high value on titles. I should like to see Beatrix mistress of Culver house Castle.' ' Her father's money would be convenient for paying off the mortgages, no doubt, provided Mr. Harefield approved of the marriage. Rather a difficult old gentleman, I fancy.' 'Difficult!' cried Mrs. Dulcimer; 'he's detest able ! a wicked old tyrant. If it were not for our friendship Beatrix's life would be unendurable/ ' Do you really think we are any good to her ? ' inquired the Vicar, in his dreamily uncertain way, as of a man who was too doubtful about the ground work of existence to feel any certainty about its minor details. This was his Bishop Berkeley mood, his mind varying in hue and tone according to the book he was reading. Just now he felt that mind was paramount over matter, and was hardly disposed to interest himself warmly in a young woman who might have no existence except in his own idea of her,"], [13, "5 MRS. DULCIMER HAS HER VIEWS. ' My dear, our house is the only notion of home the poor child has, \u2014 the only place where she meets pleasant people, or hears and sees pleasant things. How can we fail to improve and develop her ? I am sure, without egotism, I may say that I have been a God-send to that motherless girl. Think how farouche she was when she first came to us.' ' Yes, she was a wild, untamed kind of creature,' assented the Vicar. ' Beautiful as a portrait by Rembrandt though, with that tawny skin of hers. I call her la belle sauvagc. She always reminds me of Pocahontas.' ' Now wouldn't it be a blessing, Clement, if we could see her well married \u2014 married to a man of position, you know \u2014 and an honourable-minded man, like Kenrick ? You know you always said he was honourable. You could always believe him.' 'True, my love. Kenrick had his good quali ties.

Selina, ' that he would make Beatrix Harefield an excellent husband ? ' ' My dear,' said the Vicar, gravely, ' you are the best natured of women; but I am afraid you do a great deal of harm.' ' Clement ! ' ' Yes, my love. Good-nature in the abstract is undoubtedly beautiful ; but an active good-nature, always on the alert to do some service to its fellow creatures, is of all attributes the most dangerous. Even the attempt of this good man, Bishop Berke ley, to found a college in the Bermudas resulted in waste of time and money. He would have done better had he stayed at his Irish Deanery. The man who does least harm in the world is your calmly selfish person who goes through life by the narrow path of a rational self-indulgence, and never turns aside to benefit or interfere with the rest of the human race.' ' One of your dreadful paradoxes, Clement. How does that agree with St. Paul's definition of charity ?' ' My love, St. Paul's charity is a supremely passive virtue. It suffereth long, is not easily pro-"], [15, "MRS.

' Suffereth long \u2014 and is kind, you left that out, Clement.' ' Kindness there I take to imply a mental state, and not a pushing, exacting benevolence,' replied the Vicar. 'Charity poketh not its nose into its neighbour's business \u2014 maketh not matches \u2014 busieth not itself with the conduct of other people's lives \u2014 and never doeth any harm. Good-nature does no end of mischief \u2014 in a perfectly well-meaning way.' The Vicar spoke with some soreness. Poor Mrs. Dulcimer's good-nature, and sometimes misdirected energy, had been getting her into trouble for the last twenty years. Everybody liked her; every body dreaded and abhorred her good-nature. She had no children of her own, and was always full of good advice for the mothers of her acquaintance. She knew when babies ought to be weaned, and when they were sickening for the measles. She tried to heal family quarrels, and invariably made the breach, wider. She loved match-making, but"], [16, "8 AN OPEN VERDICT. her matches, when brought to the triumphant con clusion of licence or wedding cake, seldom stood the test of a few years' matrimony. She was so eager to do the best for the young men and women of her acquaintance, that she generally brought ill-assorted people together, taking too broad a view of the fitness of things, on the ground of income, family, age, and such vulgar qualifications, and ignoring those subtle differences which set an eternal mark of separation upon certain members of the human family. ' I think, Selina, if I were you, I would leave Beatrix to find a husband for herself,' said the Vicar, stretching out his legs comfortably before the wide hearth. ' She is young \u2014 there is plenty of time. Let her come here as often as she pleases. I like to see that Rembrandt face of hers. But let things take their own course. \" There's a divinity that shapes our ends, Rough hew them as we will.\" Don't you think it is almost an impertinence to wards that ever active Providence for us poor worms to be always taking one another's lives"], [17, "MRS.

She wore a good deal of lace frilling and muslin puffing about her neck and breast, and these adornments were subject to an occasional agitation, like the feathers of an ex cited Dorking, or one of the Vicar's golden-pencilled Hamburgs. ' Clement,' cried Mrs. Dulcimer, ' you have a beautiful temper, but I'm afraid you are selfish.' The Vicar laid down his book with a smile of satisfaction. He saw the opportunity for a paradox. ' My love, did you ever know a good-tempered man who wasn't selfish? or rather, did you ever know a thoroughly selfish person who wasn't good tempered ? Your wisely selfish man knows his own interest too well to fret and fume about trifles. He knows that, after si ve-and- twenty years of age, the supreme good in this life is repose, and that he can never enjoy it unless he cultivates an easy temper.'"], [18, "10 AN OPEN VERDICT. ' Selfishness is a vice, Clement.' 'That depends upon what we call selfishness. If a strict neutrality as to my neighbour's business means selfishness, assuredly I am the most selfish of men.' ' The Gospel tells us we are to love our neigh bour as ourselves, Clement.' ' I obey that divine precept implicitly. I never worry myself. I never worry my neighbour.' The Vicar might have gone a step further, and said that he liked to feed his neighbour as well as he liked to feed himself \u2014 for, in that one quality of caring for the body as well as for the souls of other people, Clement Dulcimer was a faithful follower of his Divine Master. ' And I'm afraid you allow things in your parish that oughtn't to be, Clement, sometimes,' ventured Mrs. Dulcimer. ' My dear, God allows them. They are done under the All-seeing Eye. If He cannot make men better, do you suppose I can ? ' ' You might lead them to Him, dear. ' I try my best to do that, Selina ; but I don't"], [19, "11 MRS. DULCIMER HAS HER VIEWS. drive them. That's where I fall short, I admit. Cyril is trying his hand at the driving process. He's young and energetic. We shall see how it answers, and how long he sticks at it.' ' Cyril is the most earnest young man you've ever had as a curate.' ' I taught him myself, and I know what he's made of,' murmured the Vicar. ' And there's no denying that he has done good already, Clement. The schools are better attended, and there are more poor people at church on a Sunday evening.' * Since you have such a high opinion of Cyril, how is it that you have never thought of him as a husband for Beatrix ? A clergyman ought to marry a fortune if he marries at all. He can put the money out to higher interest than any one else. He keeps a deposit account in heaven.' ' But, Clement, the title !

I should like a curate with a large income, it would be so good for the parish. And then we might rub on without the weekly offertory Cyril is always plaguing me to institute, and which I am convinced will set my congregation against me. Fancy me going up to my pulpit as a beggar every Sunday, and my people expecting value for their money out of nry sermon. Imagine their remarks at the church door : \" Not much there for sixpence,\" \" A very poor shilling's worth,\" and so forth.' 'Clement,' cried Mrs. Dulcimer, thoroughly scandalized this time, and with all her frills in mo tion, ' you ought never to have been a clergyman.' ' My love, I freely admit that some easier walk in life might have suited me better. A sub-libra rian's place, now, in some antique library, like the Cheetham Institution at Manchester. I should have had my books round me, and my superior to tell me what to do. No responsibilities, and leisure for self-culture. But if I am a poor creature as a parson, you supplement me so well, Selina, that,"], [21, "13 MRS. DULCIMER HAS HER VIEWS. between us, I think we do our duty to the parish. That last batch of soup was excellent. I tasted it yesterday at old dame Hardy's. The clear soup we get at Lord Highflyer's state dinners is mere pot-liquor compared with it. Indeed, I think,' pursued the Vicar, dreamily, as if he were medi tating a proposition of Berkeley's, 'that all clear soups are more or less a mistake \u2014 tasting only of sherry and burnt sugar.' 'Always thinking of temporal blessings, Clement.' 'They are the only blessings we can fully realize while on this side of eternity, my dear. We may be excused if we sometimes set an undue value on them.' Mrs. Dulcimer sighed, and opened her work basket. There were little shirts and flannel swathings to be made for new-comers into this world of troubles \u2014 heirs apparent to a life of labour, with a reversionary interest in the workhouse. The Vicar's wife spread her piece of linen on the table, and began a series of problems with a parallelogram in stiff brown paper, in order to find out how she"], [22, "14 AN OPEN VERDICT. might get the maximum of baby-shirts out of the minimum of linen. It vexed her that her husband should take life so lightly, and be troubled about a few things, when she was troubled about so many. She had no doubt that he was in the wrong, and that she and Cyril Culverhouse understood the real meaning of their duties a great deal better than the Vicar. Clement Dulcimer was the living embodiment of an idea which at this time had not yet been put before the world by Mr. Matthew Arnold. He was all sweetness and light. He believed in culture as the highest good. He lived among his books, and upon his books; and those books were of the best that the elect of this world have written. He sought no happiness beyond his library, save in his garden and poultry yard, which afforded his senses the gratifica tion of colour and sweet scents, sunshine and balmy air. He had travelled little, and sighed but faintly for a pleasure which he found impossible. His books and his poor absorbed all his spare cash. There was none left for foreign travel \u2014 so Mr. Dulcimer was content to enjoy Greece in the pages of Thucydides,"], [23, "15 MRS.

' I dare say I should be disappointed if I saw the reality,' he murmured placidly. 'Realities are so disenchanting. Or I might be taken by brigands, and poor Selina would have to sell her great grand-father's silver tea-kettle to ransom me.' The living at Little Yafford was a good one, and the parish was small. It was altogether one of those exceptional cures which are reserved for the more fortunate sons of the Church. Mr. Dulcimer had obtained it while he was still a young man, the living being in the gift of his uncle, Sir Philip Dulcimer, of Hawtree Hall and Yafford Park. Yafford Park was rather a dreary place, with an unwieldly barrack of the Georgian era in the middle of it, and Sir Philip had been very glad to grant a large lease of park and mansion to Mr. Piper, the Great Yafford cotton-spinner, who spent a great deal more money in little Yafford than Sir Philip would"], [24, "16 AN OPEN VERDICT. have done, but who was looked down upon by his neighbours on principle. Great Yafford, the manu facturing town five miles off, was as Radical a place as you would care to find, but Little Yafford was essentially aristocratic, ignored the commercial element altogether, and thought it an affliction to be so near the tall chimney shafts of the busy town. Little Yafford had perhaps some right to give itself airs, on the strength of being one of the prettiest villages in Yorkshire. It was like a spoiled beauty, and felt that nothing could be too good for it. Great bleak hills rose up between it and the bitter east winds, a river wound in and out of the village like a shining serpent, and licked its green meadows and garden boundaries. The long low stone bridge was as old as the Romans. There was not an ugly house in the place \u2014 except that big barrack of Sir Philip's, and that was hidden behind the fine old elms and oaks of the park. There was not a neglected garden, or an objectionable pigsty. The gentry were all well-to-do people, who bestowed money and care upon the beautification of their homes; while the poorer parishioners were under the"], [25, "MRS.

To come from stony, noisy, smoky, crowded Great Yafford to pastoral Little Yafford, was like coming from purgatory to paradise \u2014 an earthly paradise of rustic beauty and placid repose, content, and harmony. Yet Mr. Dulcimer's last new curate, Cyril Culverhouse, breathed many a thoughtful sigh over the ignorances and even vice which he dis covered in this smiling village. Coming out of some cottage door, over which the roses and honey suckle hung in unpruned luxuriance, his lips would often involuntarily ejaculate the familiar words of the evening collect \u2014 'Lighten our darkness, we beseech Thee, 0 Lord.' VOL. I."], [26, "CHAPTER II. SWORD AND GOWN. At various periods of his tranquil career the Rev. Clement Dulcimer had found it convenient to add to his income by taking a private pupil or two. He could not have endured what he called a herd of young men, meaning half a dozen, but he rather liked to have a couple of intelligent young fellows following him about through the dawdling progress of his out-of-door life, or hanging upon his words in the comfortable quietude of his study. He was an excellent master for classics and theology \u2014 mathe matics he frankly abhorred \u2014 and he taught consci entiously in his own unconventional way. The men he coached generally came out well ; but in after life there was a tinge of eccentricity in them \u2014 a strain imparted by Clement Dulcimer unawares \u2014 and which in one or two cases took the unhappy form"], [27, "SWORD AND GOWN. 19 of latitudinarianism. Spinoza on the brain, some people called it. The two pupils who had stayed longest at the Vicarage, and occupied the most important position in the minds of the Vicar and his wife, were Kenrick Culverhouse and his first cousin Cyril. Old Sir Kenrick and the Vicar had been at Oxford together, and it seemed the most natural thing that the baronet should send his only son and his orphan nephew to his old chum, more especially as he could nowhere else educate them so well or so cheaply. Culverhouse Castle was a fine historical place in Hampshire, which tourists went out of their way to see, but which the late Sir Kenrick did not regard with any enthusiasm. He had been more or less under a cloud of money difficulties ever since he could remember, and preferred lodgings in St. James's to his feudal birthplace. The moat was all very well, and so was the massive old keep, on the top of which the gardener had made a kitchen garden for gooseberries and strawberry beds ; but Sir Kenrick liked Jermyn Street and the clubs a great deal better ; and, if a man must have a castle,"], [28, "20 AN OPEN VERDICT. the King's Bench, in which he had spent some of the liveliest days of his youth, was much pleasanter to his mind than Culverhouse. Lady Culverhouse was fond of the castle, no doubt \u2014 or at any rate she stayed there, and it was a tradition in the family that no other air suited her, and that she was quite rooted to the spot ; a tradition which was all the more firmly established because nobody had ever proposed taking her anywhere else. Old Sir Kenrick and his wife had gone to join the family ashes in the vault under Culverhouse Church, and young Sir Kenrick reigned in his father's stead. All the quicksilver in the Culverhouse veins seemed to have run out with the last baronet. Young Kenrick was steady and thoughtful, and the mortgages weighed upon his spirits like a nightmare. He was always thinking what the estate would be if those mort- gages could but be paid off. It seemed to him an Eldorado. But there were only he and his cousin and heir presumptive to accomplish this great work. And how were two young men, moderately gifted, to earn fifty thousand pounds between them ?"], [29, "21 SWORD AND GOWN. ' Unless one of us were to break out into a Walter Scott, or discover a new motive power to supersede steam, I don't see how it's to be done,' Kenrick said to Mrs. Dulcimer, in one of his confidential talks with that good-natured lady, who knew all that he could tell her about the mortgages and the property. ' The army won't do it \u2014 and the church won't do it \u2014 and the law wouldn't do it under thirty years' work. Engineering might do it, perhaps, if we could blossom into Brunels, and get contracts for railways and things ; but, you see, neither of us has a turn for engineering.' ' You ought both to marry heiresses,' suggested Mrs. Dulcimer. 'Oh no, that's horrid. We couldn't do that,' cried Kenrick. ' That's too contemptible.' This was how Kenrick had talked at seventeen, when he was in his state of tutelage. He was more reticent about himself and his prospects now, at nine-and-twenty, but Mrs. Dulcimer had forgotten nothing, and when Kenrick looked grave, she always thought he was brooding upon the mortgages. ' I know that the dearest wish of his heart is to re-"], [30, "22 AN OPEN VERDICT. deem the family position,' she said, and this was what set her thinking about a marriage between Sir Kenrick and old Mr. Harefield's only daughter and heiress. Cyril had gone into the church. He loved his profession for its own sake, and thought very little of the loaves and fishes. He would like to be a bishop, no doubt, when his time came ; but it was for the sake of having a great influence and doing things in his own way, not for social status or income, that he would have desired a mitre. Doing things in his own way \u2014 that was Cyril's idea of a perfect life. To make his church beautiful, according to his idea of beauty, to have good music, and a strict adherence to the rubrics in Edward the Sixth's Prayer-book, to infuse something of the poetry of old traditions into the prosaic expression of, a reformed faith \u2014 to train his flock in his own way of thinking \u2014 to create for himself an enthusiastic and fervent congregation. These were the things which Cyril Culverhouse believed he had been sent into the world to do \u2014 rather than to help his cousin to pay off the mortgages, which mattered very little, so long as poor Ken had money enough to live upon."], [31, "23 SWORD AND GOWN. Kenrick had chosen the army for his profession. A military career offered a poor prospect of paying off the mortgages, but it was at least a gentleman like line of life, and the four or five hundred a year which coidd be squeezed out of the burdened estate enabled Kenrick to live like a gentleman among his brother officers. Honour and wealth might come to him together, perhaps, in the distant future ; and when he was growing old, and had lost the zest of life, he might be able to do something for Culver house Castle. Cyril would be a bishop, most likely, by that time, and they would sit over their port and filberts in the wainscoted parlour at Culverhouse, wagging their grey heads deprecatingly at the short comings of the rising generation, condemning new guns and novel doctrines, new lights of all kinds in camp or temple. Kenrick had served in India, and was home on leave. He was very fond of his cousin, for they had been brought up together, and nothing could be pleasanter to him than to spend his holiday fishing and shooting, reading or idling round about Little Yafford. He had liked the neighbourhood as a lad."], [32, "24 AN OPEN VERDICT. He loved it now for the sake of those boyish days which were so delightful to look back upon \u2014 all the lights in the picture remembered, all the shadows forgotten. He had an almost filial affection for Mr. and Mrs. Dulcimer \u2014 and the hills and moors and wandering streams of Yorkshire had a charm for him which was second only to his delight in his native Hampshire. The two young men were sitting by Cyril's hearth on this autumn evening, talking confiden tially over pipe and cigar. They had spent the day apart, Kenrick tramping over the moors with his gun, Cyril engaged in his parish work. They were talking of Christian Harefield, the owner of the Water House, one of the most impor tant places in Little Yafford, after the Park, and the father of that Beatrix whom Mrs. Dulcimer was so anxious to dispose of matrimonially. ' One of the most disagreeable men I ever met in my life,' said Kenrick. 'Miss Harefield was driving him in her basket pony carriage \u2014 he looked about as suitable an occupant of a pony carriage as Mephistopheles for a go-cart \u2014 and I met them at the"], [33, "SWORD AND GOWN. 25 bottom of the hill, going up that wild road to the moor. I wonder whether he was going to gather the samolus, left-handed and fasting, or to cut mistletoe with a golden sickle ? Upon my word, he looked as grim and ancient as a Druid. Beatrix stopped the pony when she saw me, and introduced me to her father. \"This is Sir Kenrick Culver house, papa,\" she said, whereat the Druid grunted. \"Are you going far up the hill?\" I asked, with the originality which distinguishes these casual con versations; \"I'm afraid it will be dark before )Tou come back.\" \" Oh, we don't mind that,\" she said \" Puck and I know our way so well.\" So they went up into the thickening mist, and I saw no more of them. I dare say they are up there still. Do you know if the old gentleman is quite right in his mind ? ' ' Yes, his mind is clear enough, so far as I have been able to discover; he is eccentric' ' And grumpy.' ' Of a gloomy turn, no doubt. He goes nowhere, and receives no one, except Mr. Scratchell, his lawyer and agent. He seems like a man whose"], [34, "26 AN OPEN VERDICT. whole nature has been soured by a great sorrow. People say that his wife's death broke his heart.' ' One would hardly suppose such a being could ever have had a wife \u2014 much less that he could have been fond of her. When did the lady die ? ' ' Don't you remember ? She died while we were at the Vicarage \u2014 about eleven years ago. There was a good deal of talk about it at the time. Mr. Harefield and his wife were travelling in Italy. Beatrix and her governess were with them \u2014 she was a child then, you know, \u2014 and Mrs. Harefield died very suddenly \u2014 after a few hours' illness. It was a case of Asiatic cholera, I believe. People who know Mr. Harefield, or rather who knew him before that time \u2014 for he holds himself aloof from every one now \u2014 say that he has been a changed man since the shock of his wife's death.' 'A melancholy story,' said Kenrick. ' I forgive him the discourteous grunt which was his sole recognition of my existence. Poor Beatrix ! A sad beginning for her life.' ' Yes,' answered Cyril, with warm interest. Motherless so early \u2014 with so strange and gloomy"], [35, "27 SWORD AND GOWN. a father. You cannot wonder that she is some what different from other girls.' ' Somewhat different from other girls,' echoed Kenrick. ' She is a queen compared with other girls. That is the difference. She is worth twenty other girls \u2014 a hundred \u2014 for she has a character of her own.' Cyril looked at him curiously. \" ' Praise from Sir Hubert Stanley ! ' \" he ex claimed, 'You are not often so enthusiastic, Ken.' ' Because I seldom see anything to praise \u2014 in a woman. Don't be frightened, Cyril. I do admire Beatrix, but only as I admire anything else in nature that is noble and rare; and I know that you admire her with quite another kind of admiration, though you have not honoured me by communi cating your ideas upon the subject.' Cyril knocked the ashes out of his pipe on the old-fashioned hob, and said not a word until he had filled it again, slowly and thoughtfully. Clement Dulcimer was right when he called Cyril the handsomer of the two cousins. His pale clear-cut face was essentially noble. Yet it was by no means essentially attractive. That steadfast look"], [36, "28 AN OPEN VERDICT. and unchangeable gravity were unpleasing to many ; but, on the other hand, Cyril's rare smile was beautiful in all eyes. It was the sudden light of mind brightening thewhole countenance ; not a me chanical contraction of the lips revealing a fine set of teeth, and wrinkling the eyelids agreeably. It was a smile that meant sympathy, regard, beneficence \u2014 a smile that comforted and cheered. The miserable among his flock knew it well; society saw it seldom. Cyril's eyes were gray, and had that steady look which passes for severity ; his nose was slightly aquiline, his mouth beautiful, his brow broad and high, with hair of neutral brown cut close to the well-shaped head, and curling crisply \u2014 hair like a gladiator's, said Kenrick, who rather prided himself upon the lighter auburn of his own locks, as he also did upon the finer line of his nose, which inclined to the Grecian, and accorded with his low straight brow and expressionless eyes, whose pupils seemed to have no more life and colour than the sculptor's dint in the marble orb. Kenrick had what is called an aristocratic look, and rather flattered himself upon those evidences of blue blood supposed to exist in an attenuated but"], [37, "29 SWORD AND GOWN. open nostril, a tapering hand, and an arched instep. These peculiarities, he imagined, declared as plainly as Domesday Book or title-deeds that the Culver houses were great people on the other side of the Channel before they honoured England by coming across the sea with Norman AVilliam to appropriate some portion of it. ' She is a noble creature,' said Cyril, with con viction, when he had pressed the last shred of latakia into the well-filled bowl, ' but she is Christian Harefield's only child ; and he is rich enough and suspicious enough to impute mercenary motives to any poor man who ventured to fall in love with his daughter.' ' Fathers have flinty hearts,' retorted Kenrick, lightly. ' That's an old saying, but sons and daughters generally contrive to follow their own inclinations in spite of paternal flintiness.

I doubt if I shall ever be able to occupy it properly,' he added, with a regretful sigh. ' I would take her without a sixpence, and work for her and cherish her all the days of my life,' said Cyril, in a deep-toned voice that trembled with strong feeling, ' but I cannot teach her to rebel against her father. \" Honour thy father and thy mother.\" She hears me read that sublime com mand every other Sunday, and am I to be the first to teach her to set it at nought ? ' ' How do you know that the old Druid would object to you ? ' 'I do not know as much directly, but Beatrix tells me that he will oppose any choice of hers.' ' Obnoxious ancient Briton ! Well, Cyril, all I can say is, if I were in love with a girl, I should think no more of her father than Romeo did of old Capulet, and I should sink the fifth commandment till after I'd married her \u2014 and then she could honour her father with a cock robin and holly bush card at Christmas, or a pair of muffettees on New Year's Day, or a sugar egg at Easter.'"], [39, "CHAPTER III. IN THE PARISH CHURCH. The Sunday evening service at Little Yafford parish church was as fashionable in its own particular way as an Italian opera in June. Everybody met every body else there. The psalms were chanted very fairly, the aDthem was always a feature, the prettiest hymns were sung, and the sermon, whether preached by the vicar or curate, seemed to have a peculiar life and fervour in it that harmonized with the more exalted feelings of the flock. The cold realism of Sunday morning gave place on Sunday evening to a vague enthusiasm, a spiritualized ardour. Of course there were people for whom that lofty liturgy soared too high \u2014 uncultured souls which demanded to be fed on coarser diet, \u2014 but these were outside the pale, and generally wore a style of bonnet which would have been a blot on the subdued beauty of the parish church, with its noble nave, long narrow"], [40, "32 AN OPEN VERDICT. aisles, carved rood screen, and waggon roof. These barbarians worshipped in a queer little chapel in High Street, to which they descended a step or two from the level of the pavement, and in which taber nacle they might be heard singing their own par ticular hymns with the utmost strength of their untrained voices, as the Church of England people went by, the Dissenters assembling half an hour earlier than their conforming brethren, and generally prolonging their service half an hour later. It was a pretty scene, that parish church of Little Yafford, in the late October evening. The clusters of wax candles in the brazen branches threw just enough light on column and arch to leave the greater part of the building in shadow. The rich colouring about the altar made a glow of splendour at the end of the gray stone chancel. The old oak pews, with their quaintly carved doors, reflected the light redly on bosses that took every shape, from the graceful fleur-dc-lys to the dog-faced demon or blunt nosed cherub. The font in its distant corner gleamed whitely below a cover of crimson cloth.

The people came in quietly by twos and threes, and took their places with the usual hushed and solemn ah' ; then the throng thickened, and the pews began to fill ; and then the bells rang more slowly, and there came a plaintive strain of melody from the organ, soft and subdued as a whisper. This swelled presently into a voluntary, and became a triumphant peal as the vestry door opened and the surpliced choir entered the chancel, two and two, the small boys first, and the rather clumsy-looking men bringing up the rear. After these followed Cyril Culverhouse, looking tall in his white raiment and crimson hood, and lastly the Vicar, a broad and dignified figure that seemed to have been intended for lawn sleeves and a bishop's gown. A girl in one of the pews directly facing the chancel looked up from her open book as Cyril took VOL. i. d"], [42, "34 AN OPEN VERDICT. his place in the reading desk, and then looked quickly down again, as if the sight were too terrible- That swift shy look, and sudden fall of the eyelids- told a secret old as Time himself. Mr. Culverhouse was something more than the curate of Little Yafford to that one member of his congregation. She was a girl of striking appearance, richly but carelessly dressed in velvet and silk, with feathers in her bonnet, according to the fashion for that year made and provided. She had one of those brilliant Southern complexions \u2014 that rich mingling of carna- tion and palest olive \u2014 which are alone sufficient for good looks ; but in her case this charm was height- ened by the splendour of dark Italian eyes, and the warm brown of rippling hair. Her brow was broad but low, her nose nondescript, her lips firmly moulded, her teeth faultless, her eyebrows strongly marked, and of a darker brown than her hair. ' I am always afraid of Trix's eyebrows,' Isabella Scratchell, the young lady's bosom friend, used to say. ' They remind me of thundery weather.' Miss Scratchell was sitting next her friend in the Harefield pew to-night. She was a small slim person,"], [43, "IN THE PARISH CHURCH. 35 distinguished by a pink and white complexion, and insignificant blunt features of the Dresden china type. There was a Scratchell pew in one of the aisles, but Beatrix liked to have her friend with her, and the Water House pew was in the more aristo cratic and fashionable situation, advantages pecu liarly agreeable to Isabella Scratchell. Mr. Harefield assisted at the Sunday morning service half a dozen times or so in a quarter, just often enough to escape the stigma of absolute in difference or infidelity. His handsome Italian wife had been a Roman Catholic, and there was a feeling among the more bigoted section of society in Little Yafford that Mr. Harefield was generally lax in his ideas, like the Romans when they began to import foreign gods, and that he would not have minded worshipping Isis and Osiris if those deities had come in his way. ' He has travelled so much, you know, my dear,' said Mrs. Piper, of the Park, to Mrs. Dulcimer, ' and having married a foreigner, you see, one can hardly expect him to be quite correct in his ideas. A sad education for that poor girl. I am told he has >"], [44, "36 AN OPEN VERDICT. taught her Greek, and hasn't allowed her to learn music. But I think that can hardly be true.' ' It is actually true about the music,' cried Mrs. Dulcimer, reflecting her friend's look of horrors ' He hates the piano, and he had Mrs. Harefield's old fashioned Broadwood sent up to the lumber-room in the tower. But there is no use in thwarting a natural gift. That poor child has taught herself by ear, and plays and sings very sweetly. She spends hours up in that old turret room \u2014 in the coldest weather \u2014 wrapped in a shawl, picking out our church music. Mrs. Harefield had an extraordinary gift, you know.' 'I never saw Mrs. Harefield. She died before Ebenezer took the Park.' ' Yes, of course. I ought to have remembered. She was a lovely woman ; and I believe that Chris tian Harefield was passionately fond of her, in his way but it was not a happy marriage; there were quar rels. I did my best, but not successfully. There is an unconquerable severity and coldness in that man's nature; and his wife had one of those ardent, im petuous dispositions, \u2014 you know what I mear.'"], [45, "IN THE PARISH CHURCH. 37 ' Exactly,' chimed in the visitor, whose mind had wandered a little, and who was wondering when the Dulcimers would have a new drawing-room carpet. The present one was threadbare, and had been in ; geniously turned and pieced, like a puzzle, odd bits of brighter colour fitting in here and there rather too obviously. That foolish Mr. Dulcimer spent all his money on books, and never improved his furniture, whereas in Mrs. Piper's ideal house there was no litter of books and pamphlets, but the last fashion in carpets and tapestry table-covers, cabriole chairs and sofas, and the newest kinds of antimacassars. Although Mr. Harefield was not often to be seen in the parish church himself, he had no objection to his daughter's frequent attendance there ; and the church and the vicarage afforded the only variety in the dullest life that a well-born heiress ever led. The music was a delight to her sensitive ear ; for the organist was a fine musician, and the organ was a noble instrument, which had been presented to Little Yafford in the reign of William the Third, by a city merchant who had been born in the village, and who came back there to die after having made his fortune"], [46, "38 AN OPEN VERDICT. in hides and tallow. His monument, in coloured and gilded marbles, after the florid style of the period, adorned the chancel, and recorded his public and private virtues, and his munificent gift of the organ, in a long Latin epitaph, with a great many adjectives ending in issimus. The Scratchells had a comfortable old house in the village, but Miss Harefield was not allowed to visit there, although Isabella was her only friend and companion. Isabella might come to the Water House as often as she liked, but it was an under stood thing that Beatrix was not to go to Mr. Scratcheli's, a distinction which Mrs. Scratchell and Isabella's brothers and sisters resented as invidious. ' We are not good enough for the heiress,' said Clementina Scratchell, sarcastically. ' She's the most stuck-up young woman I ever saw,' said Bertie, the eldest son, a sandy-complex ioned, pug-nosed youth, who had been christened Herbert, but who had more the air of a Samuel or a Thomas. Such remarks as these, if overheard, always brought down the paternal wrath upon the utterer."], [47, "IN THE PARISH CHURCH. 39 Even Mrs. Scratchell would remark mildly that poor people must not quarrel with their bread and butter, and that Mr. Harefield was a very good client to father, and that it was very kind of Miss Harefield to be so fond of Bella, although she did look down upon the others, which might be a little wounding to one's feelings, but poor people must not be proud. This fact of their poverty had always been kept before the eyes of the young Scratchells. It en countered them at every turn. If the boys tore the knees of their trousers in forbidden climbing of trees, they were reminded mournfully by a desponding mother that their parents were hard-working people, and that these destructive habits were a direct wrong to those toil-worn bread-winners. ' It isn't as if your father began life with a for tune, Bertie,' Mrs. Scratchell would say. ' He has to work for every sixpence, and you ought to have thought of that before you climbed the mulberry tree.' It was in all things alike. The Scratchells were never permitted to make any mistake as to their place in the social scale. It was to be a subordinate"], [48, "40 AN OPEN VERDICT. place always. They were to work for their bread, as their father had done before them, as their mother worked daily, from sunrise to sunset, in homely drudgery that made no effect or impression upon the world, and left nothing behind when life was done, not so much as an embroidered chair cover, or a thin volume of indifferent verses, to be admired by the next generation. They were to work, these young Scratchells. Their education was not given to them for its own sake \u2014 on the sweetness and light prin ciple \u2014 but as a preparation for a laborious career. Herbert was to be apprenticed to Mr. Pontorson, the surveyor at Great Yafford. Adolphus \u2014 poor Mrs. Scratchell had insisted upon giving her children the cheap luxury of fine names \u2014 was promised a clerk ship in a factory. Isabella was already earning a salary as morning governess to the little Pipers at Yafford Park. It was not an onerous engagement, and left her afternoons free. Mr. Scratchell thought she ought to get another engagement to fill up her afternoons, but as yet Isabella had contrived to avoid this double labour. She was her father's favourite, and was believed to have great influence over him."], [49, "IN THE PARISH CHURCH. 41 It was she who was always charged with the task of imparting any disagreeable intelligence to him, such as the kitchen boiler having cracked, the supply of coals being nearly run out, or Adolphus having broken 'another window.' The previous fracture on this wretched youth's part wras always so recent as to exaggerate the iniquity of the present offence. It was scarcely strange, perhaps, if from this Spartan training the little Scratchells grew up with the idea that poverty was life's chief evil. Just as the Stoics believed virtue to be the only good, the young Scratchells believed want of money to be the only ill. ' Ah, my clears, a fat sorrow is better than a lean sorrow,' Mrs. Scratchell remarked, plaintively, when she heard of the afflictions of her wealthier neigh bours. She could not bring herself even to pity her husband's patron, Mr. Harefield, who was supposed to have had his heart broken by the untimely death of his handsome wife. It seemed to her impossible that so rich a man, surrounded with all the good things of this life, could be an object for compassion."], [50, "42 AN OPEN VERDICT. This close acquaintance with necessity had not endeared that stern goddess's countenance to Isa bella. She had a secret hankering after the good things of this life ; and to her mind Beatrix Hare field, whose solitary existence was for most people a subject of pity, was a person to be envied. Had she not a fine old house to live in, every room in which was like a picture, horses and carriages at her dis posal, servants to wait upon her, and an unlimited supply of pocket-money ? It was a dull life, of course, but Mr. Harefield would die before very long, no doubt, and take his gloominess to a more appro priate habitation, and then Beatrix would be the richest woman in the neighbourhood, free to drain the cup of pleasure to the lees. Ten years ago, when Beatrix was a tall, thin legged child in a short black frock, recovering slowly from a severe attack of whooping-cough, the family doctor ventured to call attention to the exceeding solitariness of her life, and to suggest that some juvenile companionship should be pro cured for her. It was less than a year after Mrs. Harefield's death, and the master of the Water"], [51, "43 IN THE PARISH CHURCH. House wore an air of settled gloom which made him, in the minds of his fellow-men, somewhat unapproachable. The doctor made his suggestion timidly. He was only the family practitioner of Little Yafford, and was much humbler in his manners and pretensions than the bakers and butchers of that settlement ; for those traders knew that people must have bread and meat always, while epidemics, accidents, and chronic diseases were subject to periods of dulness, sorely depress ing to the faculty. If he had been Dr. Fawcus, the consulting physician of Great Yafford, he would have ordered playfellows for Miss Harefield with as off-hand an air as he ordered boiled chicken and barley water. But Mr. Namby made the suggestion tentatively, quite prepared to withdraw it if it were ill received. ' The child seems dull, certainly,' said Mr. Harefield. ' She doesn't run, or skip, or scream, like the general run of children. I have thought it an advantage ; but I suppose, as you say, it is a sign of feebleness of constitution.' ' I think that anything which would enliven"], [52, "44 AN OPEN VERDICT. her spirits might conduce to her recovery',' replied the doctor. 'She doesn't gain strength as fast as I should wish.' ' Really ! ' said Mr. Harefield, with a far-off look, as if he were talking of somebody at the Antipodes. ' Well, if you think it wise, we must get her a playfellow. I have received no visitors, as you know, since my wife's death. In my best days I always considered society more or less a bore, and I could not endure to have people about me now. But we must get a playfellow for the child. Have you a girl that would do ? ' The surgeon blushed. What an opening it might have been for his daughter, had she been old enough ! Unhappily she was still in her cradle. He explained this to Mr. Harefield. ' My agent, Scratchell, has a little girl, I believe.' 'He has several.' ' One is quite enough,' said Mr. Harefield. ' I'll tell him to send one of his girls to play with Beatrix.' Writing to his agent on some business matter"], [53, "45 IN THE PARISH CHURCH. that evening, Christian Harefield added this post script, \u2014 ' Oblige me by sending the quietest of your girls to play with my daughter every afternoon at three.' The request was somewhat curtly put, but the Scratchells saw in it the opening of a shining path that led to the temple of fortune. From that hour Isabella was exalted above all her sisters and brothers. She was like Joseph with his coat of many colours. All the other sheaves bowed down to her sheaf. She had better raiment than the others, that she might be presentable at the Water House. She never had her boots mended more than once. After the second mending they were passed on to Clementina, whether they fitted or not. Cle mentina protested piteously. Beatrix received her new companion, and abso lutely her first playfellow, with open arms, and a heart overflowing with love that had run more or less to waste hitherto, or had been squandered on ponies, dogs, and guinea-pigs. Miss Scales, the governess, was not lovable. One might as well have tried to love the Druid stones on the moor"], [54, "46 AN OPEN VERDICT. above Little Yafford. Christian Harefield wrapped himself in gloom as in a mantle, and lived apart from all the world. So Isabella's coming was like the beginning of a new life for Beatrix. She was enraptured with this little fair-haired girl, who knew how to play at all manner of nice games which Beatrix had never heard of, and which Miss Scales condemned as vulgar. Happily Isabella had been so well drilled in the needy, careful home, that she behaved with a propriety in which even Miss Scales could find no flaw. When questioned by Mr. Harefield, the governess reported favourably, though with a certain condescending reserve, of the young guest, and, from coming for an hour or two every afternoon, Isabella came almost to live at the Water House, and to receive a share of Miss Scales valuable instructions, that lady's acquirements behi\" of a solid and unornamental character which Mr. Harefield approved. ' I shall have your girl carefully educated,' said Christian Harefield to his man of business. ' I am bound to make some return for her services as my daughter's companion. But if you want her taught"], [55, "47 IN THE PARISH CHURCH. music and dancing, you'll have to get that done elsewhere. My girl learns neither.' As well as these educational advantages Isabella received other benefits which her youthful mind better appreciated, in the occasional gift of a silk frock or a warm winter jacket, purchased for her by Miss Scales at Mr. Harefield's desire ; and when Beatrix grew up and had plenty of pocket-money, she was always giving Bella presents. ' It's like having a fairy godmother,' said Flora, the third of the Scratchell daughters, with a pang of envy. There sat the two girls in the Water House pew this October evening, everybody in the parish church knowing their history, and thinking it a very pretty trait of character in Mr. Harefield's daughter that she should be so fond of her humble friend Bella ; for it must be understood that Mr. Scratchell, never having been able- to struggle out of the morass of poverty or to keep more than one maid-servant, hardly took his full professional rank in the village, or was even regarded as a gentleman by Act of Parliament."], [56, "48 AN OPEN VERDICT. It was a recognised fact that without Mr. Hare field's business, the collection of rents, and drawing up of leases, and ejection of troublesome tenants, and so on, the Scratchells could hardly have gone on existing, outside the workhouse, the solicitor's practice, over and above this agency, being of the pettiest and most desultory order. Bella's pretty little Dresden china face was bent over her book as the choir and clergy came filing in. But though Bella's head was gracefully bent, she gave a little upward glance under her auburn eye lashes, and contrived to see that look in Beatrix's face which was in itself the beginning of a history. And then the service began, and both girls seemed absorbed in their devotions, while Mrs. Dulcimer, contemplating them benignantly from the vicarage pew, thought what a pretty pair they made, and wondered whom she could pitch upon as a husband for Bella. The poor little thing ought to be married. She was not a great heiress like Beatrix, but it was not the less incumbent upon some good-natured friend to find her a husband \u2014 nay, it was a Christian duty to do so. Matrimony"], [57, "IN THE PARISH CHURCH. 49 wouid be the poor child's only escape from strait ened circumstances and a life of toil. Everybody knew what a struggle these poor Scratchells had to make for the bare privilege of living. 'She's rather pretty, and certainly graceful,' mused Mrs. Dulcimer, while one of the wicked kings of Israel was misconducting himself. Even a clergyman's wife's mind will occa sionally wander, though her husband may be reading the lesson. ' I wish I could think of some one to suit her,' said Mrs. Dulcimer to herself. And then it chanced that her glance roamed absently to the reading-desk, where Cyril's crisp brown hair and strongly marked brow showed above the open Prayer-book. ' The very man ! ' Mrs. Dulcimer ejaculated inwardly, in an ecstasy of good nature. It is so delightful to feel one's self the pro vidence of one's neighbours. Poor Mrs. Dulcimer's mind was distracted during the rest of the service. This notion about Cyril was one of those splendid ideas which take hold of the female mind with over- E VOL.

Vainly did the busy soul try to pin her mind to the Prayer-book. She could not get her thoughts away from the suitability of a match between Cyril and Bella. There was a remarkable fitness about it. Neither of them had any money of their own. That made it so nice. They couldn't feel under any obligation to each other. Cyril would, of course, get on well in the church. People always did who were as earnest and well connected as Cyril Culverhouse. And then what an admirable wife Bella would make for a poor man \u2014 a girl who had been brought up to pinch, and contrive, and deny herself, and make sixpence do the work of a shilling ! It never occurred to Mrs. Dulcimer that this long apprenticeship to self-denial might have induced in Bella a era vine for the good things of this life, and an ardent desire for the opportunity of self-indulgence. By the time Cyril went up into the pulpit to preach his sermon, Mrs. Dulcimer had married him"], [59, "51 IN THE PARISH CHURCH. to Isabella, and settled them in a modest but com fortable living, with the prettiest and most rustic of vicarages, where the housemaid's pantry would afford ample scope for Isabella's domestic talents, while the ignorance of an agricultural parish would give full play to Cyril's energy and earnestness. Cyril Culverhouse preached an admirable sermon. He had that gift of clear and concise language, short sentences, bold and distinct expression, appropriate metaphor, and strong colouring, which makes certain books in the English language stand out from all other writing with a force and power that command the ad miration alike of the cultured and uncultured reader. He had not the subtlety, finesse, and erudition of his Vicar, who preached for the most part to please his own fancy, and very often over the heads of his congregation. Cyril's earnestness made every sermon an exhortation, a call to repentance and holy living. It was hardly possible to hear him and not be moved by him. It would have been sheer stony-heartedness in his hearers to sit there and listen to him and make no resolve to live better, and be touched by no pang of compunction for past errors."], [60, "52 AN OPEN VERDICT. Beatrix listened with all her soul in her eyes. Once and once only Cyril's large gaze, sweeping the mass of faces, caught that upward look of the dark eyes. It seemed to him to take away his breath for a moment, and checked the progress of a vigorous peroration. He faltered, substituted a word, recovered himself in an instant, and went on ; and no one knew how that one little look had moved him. The clock struck eight as the congregation came trooping out of the church, with much greeting of neighbours in the darkness just outside the old stone porch. Mrs. Dulcimer seized upon the two girls, as they were going away, with a sober-looking man-servant, in a dark livery, in attendance on the heiress. ' You are not going home, Trix,' cried the Vicar's wife. 'You and Bella must come to the Vicarage to supper. It's an age since I've seen you.' ' Dear Mrs. Dulcimer, I spent the day with you only last Tuesday ! I am quite ashamed of coming so often ! ' ' You foolish child, you know it is my delio-ht"], [61, "53 IN THE PARISH CHURCH. to have you. And Bella must come to-night. I in sist on Bella's coming too.' O This was said with unconscious condescension. It was, of course, a grand thing for Miss Scratchell to be asked to supper at the Vicarage. ' Papa expects me to go straight home,' said Beatrix, evidently anxious to accept the invitation. ' My love, you know your papa never expects anything from you. You are quite your own mis tress. Parker,' said Mrs. Dulcimer, wheeling sud denly and addressing herself to the footman, ' you will be good enough to tell your master, with my compliments, that I am taking Miss Harefield to the Vicarage for supper, and that you are to come for her at ten o'clock. You understand, Parker, at ten ; and you can take a glass of ale in the Vicarage kitchen while Miss Harefield puts on her bonnet.' Mrs. Dulcimer always went into details, and overflowed in small acts of good nature to the inferior classes."], [62, "CHAPTER IV. DOWER'D WITH OUR CURSE, AND STRANGER'D AVITH OUR OATH.' There was no pleasanter house in Little Yafford or its neighbourhood to visit on a Sunday evening than the shabby old Vicarage, in which Mr. and Mrs. Dulcimer had lived happily for the last twenty years. It was an old house \u2014 and had never been a grand house even in its best days; indeed, there was a legend in Little Yafford that it had once belonged to a farm, and there was a certain homely substan- tiality and solidity about it which favoured that idea. Severe critics declared that there was not a single good room in the house, and it must be admitted that all the rooms were low, and that the chimneys projected into them in a way which modern architecture disallows, leaving a deep recess on each side to be filled up with books, old china or such miscellaneous goods as Mrs. Piper, of the Park, denounced comprehensively as rubbish. The"], [63, "' DOWER'D WITH OUR CURSE.' 55 windows were casements, with leaden lattices, and admitted as little light as was consistent with their obvious functions. Heavy beams supported the low ceilings, big old grates devoured incalculable quantities of fuel, but happily coals \u2014 pronounced for the most part as a dissyllable \u2014 co-als \u2014 were cheap at Little Yafford. The furniture was in keeping with the house, for it was all ancient and shabby, and had a wonderful individuality about it, which, in Clement Dulcimer's opinion, quite atoned for its shabbiness. Almost all those old chairs and tables, and sofas, and brass mounted sideboards, and Indian cabinets, and Queen Anne whatnots, had come to the Vicar by inheritance, and it was to him as if he saw the friendly faces of dead and gone kindred smiling at him from the three cornered bureau, or the Japanese escritoire, or the walnut- wood chest of drawers. He even got into the way of calling the furniture after the testators who had left it to him, and would tell his wife to fetch him the packet of sermon-paper out of Aunt Tabitha, or that he had left his spectacles on Uncle Joseph."], [64, "56 AN OPEN VERDICT. The dining-room on this autumnal Sunday even ing had a look of homely comfort which was cheering to a heart not given wholly over to spiritual things. It was a long low room, with three square casements on the southern side, and a wide old fireplace, bordered with blue and white Dutch tiles, at the end. On each side of the fireplace was the deep recess before mentioned, filled with old oak shelves, on which were ranged the odds and ends of porcelain and dels which had, as it were, dropped from various branches of the family tree into Clement Dulcimer's lap. Aunt Tabitha's Swansea tea set, with its sprawling red roses on a cream-coloured ground ; uncle Timothy's quaint Lowestoft jugs ; cousin Simeon's Bow punchbowl ; grandmamma's Oriental dessert-plates ; a Chelsea shepherdess minus an arm, a Chelsea shepherd piping to a headless sheep. There was a good deal of rubbish, no doubt, as Mrs. Piper declared, amidst that heterogeneous collection ; but there was a great deal more value in those cups and plates than Clement Dulcimer suspected, or he would have been sorely tempted to exchange them for books. At the end of the room facing the fireplace"], [65, "'DOWER'D WITH OUR CURSE.' 57 stood that fine old sideboard of the Chippendale period, familiarly known as Uncle Joseph. Facing the windows there was a curtained archway commu nicating with the library. To-night a big fire burned in the capacious grate, a log of the old poplar that was blown down in the last high wind blazing merrily at the top of the coals, as if the stout old tree felt glad to make so jovial an end. The supper table shone and glittered with old silver and heavy diamond-cut glass, with here and there a tall-stemmed beaker, or an engraved flask, as old as the pictures of Teniers or Breughel. A bowl of chrysanthemums, a ham, a game pie, a sirloin, and a salad made a glow of colour, and promised a sub stantial repast. Everybody knew that what the Vicar gave was of the best, no cheap champagnes or doubtful moselles, but sound claret, and the finest beer that was brewed on this side of York. The supper-hour was supposed to be nine o'clock, and on returning from church the gentlemen had come straight to the dining-room. Mrs. Dulcimer and the two girls found them there when they came downstairs after taking off their bonnets."], [66, "58 AN OPEN VERDICT. The Vicar was standing in front of the fire, caressing his favourite tabby cat with his foot, as that privileged animal rolled upon the hearth-rug. Sir Kenrick sat in cousin Simeon's arm-chair, a deep velvet-covered chair, almost as large as a small house. Cyril stood looking dreamily down at the fire. ' Welcome, young ladies ! ' exclaimed the Vicar, cheerily. ' I thought Mrs. Dulcimer was never going to give us our supper. Come, Beatrix, this is your place, at my right hand.' 'And Sir Kenrick will sit next Beatrix/ cried Mrs. Dulcimer, on man\u0153uvring intent. 'Bella, my love, you next the Vicar, and Cyril must sit by me. I want to ask him about the next missionary meeting.' They were all seated after good-natured Mrs. Dulcimer's desire, \u2014 Kenrick by the side of Beatrix, gravely contemplative of the fine face with its rich un-English colouring ; Cyril looking a little distrait as lively Miss Scratchell discussed his sermon in her bright appreciative way, and with an air of being quite as well read in theology as he was.

' asked Bella, smiling across the chrysanthemums, and offering to the baronet's contemplation an insignifi cant piettiness, all dimples and pale pink roses. 'As much as I like any sermons, except the Vicar's,' answered Kenrick, coolly. 'I like to hear Mr. Dulcimer preach, because he makes me think. I sit on tenter-hooks all the time, longing to stand up and argue the point with him. But as for Cyril's moral battering-rams and catapults, and all the artillery which he brings to bear against my sinful soul, I'm afraid their chief effect is to make me drowsy.'

The Vicar talked of men and of books, the younger men joining in just enough to sustain the conversation. Supper at the Vicarage, substantial as the meal was, seemed more or less an excuse for sitting at a table talking, for a couple of hours at a stretch. Long after the sirloin had been carried off to do duty in the kitchen, Mr. Dulcimer sat in the carver's seat, sipping his claret and talking of men and books. Beatrix could not imagine anything more delightful than those Sunday evening discourses. But now came a message from the footman in the kitchen to remind his mistress that it was half past ten.

Old Christian Harefield, the father of the present owner of the estate, had been distinguished for various eccentricities, the chief of which Avas love of money. He did not love it too well to spend it on himself, but he loved it too well to waste it upon his fellow-creatures, whom he did not love. He was a born man-hater. No youthful disappoint ments, no wrong-doing of a familiar friend, no inconstancy of a Avoman, had soured his temper, or changed the current of his life. In his nursery he had regarded outside humauity Avith a cold distrust, and had been selfish in the transactions of his baby hood. At Eton he was known as the most respect able of lads, and was universally detested. There was a legend of his having given a boy he disliked the scarlatina, deliberately and of malice afore thought ; and this was the only thing he had ever"], [83, "75 HIS ITALIAN WIFE. been known to give away. At the University he took care of himself, made his rooms the prettiest in his quad, rode good horses, read diligently and took his degree with ease, but he refused all invitations to wine parties, rather than incur the expense of returning hospitality, and he was remembered among his contemporaries as Stingy Harefield. When the time came for him to marry he made no attempt to escape that ordeal, as it presented itself to him in the form of an alliance with a certain Jane Pynsent, a young lady whose personal attrac tions Avere not startling, but Avhose father had enriched himself by commerce, and had recently acquired a large tract of land in Lincolnshire. The young lady and the tract of land Avent in one lot, and Christian married her, Avithout feeling himself guilty of that kind of sentimental folly called 'falling in love;' a weakness which offended his reason in those inferior animals Avhom stern neces sity obliged him to acknowledge as his fellow creatures.

A year or two later Mr. Harefield Avas heard of as living near Florence Avith the lovely Italian wife and a baby, and nine years after his father's death he came suddenly home to the Water House, bringing the lovely wife, and a little girl of three years old, home with him. He was now a man of middle age, very grave of aspect, but courteous and not inaccessible.

Everybody agreed that Christian Harefield Avas devoted to his wife, and that it Avas a happy marriage. But for his little girl he had evidently no very warm regard.

Miss Scales' prim perfection had been like a band of iron about her life. Her father's gloom and hardness had Aveighed upon her like an actual burden. She had waked in the night sobbing, startled from some dim strange dream of an impossible happiness, by the recollection that she had a father who had never loved her, Avho never would love her. This hardness of her father's had gradually hard ened her feelings towards him. She had left off hoping for any change in him, and Avith the cessation of hope came a stream of bitterness which over- Avhelmed every sweet and filial sentiment. As she grew from child to woman, her memories of the past took a new shape. Well-remembered scenes acted themselves over again before her mental vision under a new and more vivid light. She began to see that there had been unhappiness in her mother's life, and that her father had been the cause of it, that the cloud had always come from him. Brief episodes of that bygone life flashed back upon her with a cruel distinctness. She remembered"], [101, "93 HIS ITALIAN WIFE. herself leaning on her mother's shoulder one evening as Mrs. Harefield sat at the drawing-room piano Aveaving the sweet tangle of Italian melody she loved so well. It was a summer twilight, and the windoAvs were all open, the garden Avas full of roses, the river Avas shining under the setting sun. She remembered her father's coming in suddenly, and Avalking up to the piano. He took her by the wrist with a hard strong hand that hurt her a little. ' Go to your governess,' he said. ' I Avant to talk to your mother.' And then, before she could reach the door, she heard him say, \u2014 ' So you have seen Antonio agaiu.' Those Avords haunted her curiously now that she was growing a woman. Who was Antonio ? She could remember no one in the history of her life to Avhom that name belonged. \u2022 It was an Italian name \u2014 the name of one of those Italian friends of her mother's who came and went in those memory pic tures, like figures in a dream.

But she could not recall any one of them who had impressed her, a wondering child of seven, more than the rest. Yes, there Avas one \u2014 the one who sang so beauti fully. She could remember sitting on her mother's lap one evening before dinner, the room dimly lighted, no one present but her mother and the Italian gentleman. She remembered his sitting at the piano and singing church music \u2014 music that thrilled her till, in a nervous ecstasy, she burst into tears, and her mother soothed her and carried her away, saying something to the strange gentleman in Italian as she went towards the door, and he got up from the piano and came to them and stopped on the threshold to bend down and kiss her, as she had never been kissed before in all her life. She could remember the kiss now, though it was ten years ago. And he spoke to her mother in Italian, a feAv hurried words that seemed half sorrow and half anger. Was that Antonio ?

' Dear room,' she said, ' to think that I should live so near you, pass your door every day, and yet remember you so faintly, as if you were a dream !' Once a curious fancy flashed upon her as she sat in the evening glow, looking up at those windows. 'Perhaps Antonio's picture is in that room.'

The new home life at the Vicarage brightened her wonderfully. Her reserve wore off as she grew accustomed to that friendly household. She was enraptured with Mr. Dulcimer's library.

Religion hitherto, as interpreted by Miss Scales, had appeared to her a hard and difficult business, Avhich no one could take to except under severest pressure \u2014 a system of punishments and penances invented for the torment of mankind. But in Cyril's teaching how different it all seemed ! Re ligion became a sentiment to live or die for. Without it happiness or peace of mind seemed impossible.

' I don't know,' she answered, sadly. ' Mamma never talked to me about religion. I was too young, perhaps.' Cyril found her curiously ignorant of all that was most vital in religion, and his first interest in her arose from this very ignorance of hers. He was so glad to set her right \u2014 to get her out of the narrow Scales track, Miss Scales being essentially Loav Church, and scenting Roman encroachment in an anthem or a surplice. The interest soon deepened, but he could hardly have told when it first grew into love. Perhaps that might never have come, if Beatrix's fresh young soul had not gone out to meet his unawares, so that ere he knew himself a lover he found himself beloved.

CHRISTIAN HAREFIELD'S ANSAVER. The Monday after that Sunday evening supper at the Vicarage dragged more heavily than any day Beatrix could remember since that never-to-be forgotten awful day when \u2014 a little child in a strange city \u2014 she was told of her mother's death. To-day she felt that a blow was impending \u2014 a stroke that must shatter the rosy chain that bound her to her bright new life. The strictness of Miss Scales' rule had been relaxed since Beatrix's eighteenth birthday. The lady was now rather companion and duenna than governess; but Miss Scales was con scientious, and did not care to take her salary Avithout earning it, so she had urged upon Beatrix that a young lady of eighteen was in duty bound to go on improving her mind, and Beatrix had con sented to two hours' daily reading, on a rigid system.

That her favourite authorities could be superseded was a possibility beyond Miss Scales' mental grasp. She had learned out of those books, and would continue to teach out of them to her dying day. Upon this particular Monday the English his torians hung somewhat heavily. Hume was dull \u2014 and Eapin furnished no improvement upon him. ' Really, Miss Scales dear,' said Beatrix at last, Avith a stifled yawn, ' I don't think I am appreciat ing Joan of Arc at all properly this morning.

' Mr. Dulcimer is a horrid person to tell you such stories ; and after this I shouldn't be at all surprised at his going over to Rome.' 'Would you much mind my putting up the books, Miss Scales love?' asked Beatrix, in the coaxing way in Avhich she was wont to address her duenna. ' My mind isn't equal to grasping such heroism as Joan's to-day.' 'You have been looking absent-minded all the morning, certainly.' ' I do feel rather head-achy.' ' Then you'd better take a seidlitz powder \u2014 and be sure you put in the blue paper first ' ' No, thank you, dear, I'm really not ill. But I think a turn in the garden would do me good.

He, Cyril Culverhouse, who had not a sixpence beyond his stipend, and who yet came of too good a family to be called an adventurer. He had never spoken to Mr. Harefield, and he was going to him to ask for his daughter's hand. The position was difficult, but Cyril did not shrink from facing it. He went under the archway into the grassy quadrangle, where the low stone mullioned windoAvs faced him Avith their dull blank look, as of windoAvs out of which no one ever looked. There was a low door in a corner, studded with iron nails \u2014 and a bell that Avould have been loud enough for a means of communication Avith a house a quarter of a mile away. This noisy bell clanged out un mercifully in the afternoon quiet. ' He will never forgive me for ringing such a peal as that,' thought Cyril. The staid old butler looked at him Avonderingly Avhen he asked if Mr. Harefield was at home. Visitors were rare at the Water House.

' The butler led the Avay to the draAving-room, without a word. He had heard Mr. Culverhouse preach, at odd times, though himself a member of the Little Yafford Baptists, and had too much respect for his cloth to express his opinion as to the uselessness of this proceeding. He led the Avay to the draAving-room and left Cyril there. It was a pretty room, despite the gloom that had fallen upon it.

But there was no sign of occupation \u2014 no open piano \u2014 not a book out of its place \u2014 not a newspaper or pamphlet on the tables. Everything was in perfect order, as in a house that is shown and not lived in. This was the first time Cyril had been under"], [116, "108 AN OPEN VERDICT. the roof that sheltered Beatrix. He looked around him for some trace of her presence, but he saw no such trace. Did she inhabit this room ? No, it was evidently a room in which no one lived.

' Poor child, she is Avatching for me, perhaps,' he thought Avith tender sadness, ' waiting and fearing.' 'My master Avill be pleased to see you, sir,' said the voice in the doorway, and Cyril turned to folloAv the butler. He followed him down a corridor that went the whole length of the house. The butler opened a deep-set oak door, thick enough for a gaol, and gravely announced the visitor. It was a very solemn thing altogether, Cyril felt. He found himself in a large low room, lined from floor to ceiling with books on carved oak"], [117, "CHRISTIAN HAREFIELD'S ANSWER. 109 shelves. A sombre brownness prevailed through out the room. All that was not brown leather Avas brown oak. Three low Avindows looked into a courtyard. A pile of damp logs smouldered on the wide stone hearth. Cyril had never entered a more gloomy room. The master of the Water House stood before the hearth, ready to receive his visitor \u2014 a tall, powerfully built man, in a long cloth dressing-gown, like a monk's habit, which made him look taller than he really was. The hard, stern face would have done for one of Cromwell's Ironsides ; the grizzled black hair worn somewhat long, the large nostrils, iron mouth and jaw, dark deep-set eyes, and heavily lined forehead were full of character; but it was character that was calculated to repel rather than to invite sympathy. ' You have asked to see me on particular business, Mr. Culverhouse,' said Christian Hare field, Avith a wave of his hand which might or might not mean an invitation to be seated. He remained standing himself. ' If it is any question of church restoration, Mr. Dulcimer ought to know"], [118, "110 AN OPEN VERDICT. that my cheque-book is at his command. I take no personal interest in these things, but I like to do Avhat is right.' 'It is no question of church restoration, Mr, Harefield.' 'Some of your poor people burned out, or washed out, or down with fever, perhaps ? I hear you are very active in good works. My purse is at your disposal. Pray do not scruple to make use of it. I do so little good myself, that I am glad to practise a little vicarious benevolence.' He seated himself at a large oak table covered Avith books and papers, and opened his cheque-book. ' How much shall it be ? ' he asked, in a business like tone. Cyril was looking at him thoughtfully. There Avas something noble in that iron-gray head, surely \u2014 a grand intelligence at least, if not the highest type of moral good. ' Pardon me, Mr. Harefield,' said the curate, ' you are altogether mistaken in the purpose of my visit. I came to ask no favour for others. I am here as a suppliant for myself alone.

While taking charge of Bella Scratchells destiny, Mrs. Dulcimer's busy mind had not forgotten the interests of her older protege\", Sir Kenrick Cul verhouse, whose mortgaged estate was to be set free by means of Beatrix Harefield's fortune. She was quite pleased with herself for the brilliant idea of disposing comfortably of Cyril by handing him over to Miss Scratchell, and thus leaving Sir Kenrick without a rival in the field. ' That foolish husband of mine would have been trying to make a match between Beatrix and his favourite Cyril,' she said to herself. ' But if I can put it into Cyril's head that Bella Scratchell is very fond of him, he is almost sure to fall over head and ears in love with her. Men always do. I have not forgotten Benedick and Beatrice.'"], [189, "181 BELLA IN SEARCH OF A MISSION. All Mrs. Dulcimer's good intents with regard to Sir Kenrick and the mortgages were suddenly frustrated by a letter from Beatrix, which at once surprised and puzzled her.

After Mrs. Dulcimer's visit to the Scratchell domicile, Bella came very often to the Vicarage, carrying her neat little leather work-bag, and spending the afternoon in a friendly way. If she did not come of her own accord, Mrs. Dulcimer would even go the length of sending Rebecca, or that useful lad who was a boot, knife, and garden boy in the morning, and a page in the afternoon, to fetch her. The Vicar's wife Avas glad to have a companion who appre ciated her conversation better than the absent minded Vicar, whose eyes were always on his books, and whose answers were too obviously mechanical. So it happened that, through this skilful contriving of Mrs. Dulcimer's, Bella found herself very often in Cyril's society. Cyril Avas very fond of Mr. Dulcimer, and had a good deal of parish work to discuss with him. This brought him to the Vicarage nearly every evening. He used to drop in at the fag end of the tea \u2014 a"], [191, "183 BELLA IN SEARCH OF A MISSION. substantial meal which Avas tea and supper com bined \u2014 and take his place by Mrs. Dulcimer, at a corner of the tray, just in time for the last decent cup of tea, as the Vicar's wife would remark plaintively. 'Why don't you come at seven o'clock, and sit down with us in a sociable manner,' she com plained, 'instead of coming in when the teapot is just exhausted? Bella has been quite anxious about you. \" I'm sure Mr. Culverhouse over fatigues himself in his devotion to his parish Avork,\" she said just now.' Bella blushed, and turned her pretty blue eyes shyly upon the curate. ' And I am sure you do,' she said. ' It's quite dreadful. You will have a fever or something. You are so careless about your health.' Cyril saw neither the blush nor the shy look in the soft blue eyes. Bella's eyes wore always that soft look in company, but they could harden and assume a much keener gaze during the every day business of life.

It was very aggravating, but Benedick was so at first, Mrs. Dulcimer remembered. ' How much I miss Beatrix Harefield ! ' said the Vicar. ' There is something original about that girl which always interested me \u2014 and then she has such a mind to appreciate books. I never saw so young a creature fasten as she . does on a great book. She seems to have an instinct which always leads her to the best.' ' She is a noble creature,' said Cyril, quietly. 'What a wife she would have made for your cousin!' exclaimed Mrs. Dulcimer, too eager to be able to mask her batteries altogether. 'She would make a noble wife \u2014 for any man,' assented Cyril. ' Of course, but she and your cousin seemed so peculiarly suited to each other.

You need not take me up so sharply. Kenrick a fortune-hunter ! \u2014 of course not. But where these things combine However we need not dispute about it. That wretched Mr. Harefield is resolved to immure his daughter in that dreary old house of his. She is as badly off as a princess in a fairy tale.' ' Worse,' said Bella, ' for there are no adven turous princes in these degenerate days.' ' How does she bear this cruel treatment ? ' asked Cyril, looking at Bella for the first time, since he had shaken hands with her on arriving. ' You see her often, don't you, Miss Scratchell ? ' ' Two or three times a week.

Anon came a solid block of histories, from Herodotus to Guizot. Mrs. Dulcimer established herself at her work table, with Bella by her side. The curate seated himself by his Vicar and began to talk of the parish. In her heart Bella hated that parish talk \u2014 the rheu matic old Avomen \u2014 the sick children \u2014 men who were out of work or down with fever \u2014 the sufferers \u2014 the sinners \u2014 the cases of all kinds that needed help.

And yet at that moment Bella was contemplating a step Avhich would bring her into very close contact Avith the poor of Little Yafford.

It Avas pleasant to sit in this pretty room, lined with many coloured volumes, all kept with an exquisite neatness, which was a feature in Mr. Dulcimer's love of books. The glow of the fire, the subdued radiance of the lamps, the rich dark red of the curtains, made a warm brightness unknown in those bare rooms at home. And every now and then Bella's blue eyes shot a glance at the curate's earnest face \u2014 or, when he was most occupied, dwelt upon it admiringly for a few moments. ' Ten o'clock,' exclaimed Mrs. Dulcimer, as the skeleton clock on the chimney-piece chimed the hour.

' As this was directly addressed to Cyril, he felt himself compelled to answer. ' Well, yes,' he deliberated. ' I suppose she is the kind of little person usually called pretty.

' Don't be angry with me, Mrs. Dulcimer, but I must confess I hate Dresden china,' said Cyril, laughing. ' But I like Miss Scratchell,' he added hastily, ' because she seems good and amiable.

That girl Avill make a perfect wife.' ' I have no doubt she will. And I dare say you have already decided on the happy man Avho is to be her husband,' replied Cyril, innocently. Mrs. Dulcimer actually blushed. Bella came back in her neat little bonnet, and comfortable shepherd's plaid shawl. Those were days in which women still wore bonnets and shawls. She looked the picture of sweetness and innocence in that cottage bonnet, tied under her pretty little chin, and surrounding her face like a halo.

Sir Kenrick Culverhouse had gone to Hamp shire to look at the old domain. He had plenty of friends in the neighbourhood of Culverhouse, who would have been glad to give him hospitality, but he preferred the less luxurious accommodation of his own house, which was maintained by a couple of faithful old servants, very much in the style of the Master of Ravenswood's immortal ininagc at Wolf's Craig. The old butler was not so amusing or so enthusiastic as Caleb Balderstone ; but he Avas every whit as faithful, and preferred his board wages and bacou dumplings, in the halls of the good old race, to those fleshpots of Egypt which he might perchance have found in the service of some mushroom gentleman or commercial magnate newly established in the neighbourhood. People had told Kenrick that he ought to let"], [219, "SIR KENRICK'S ANCESTRAL HOME. 211 Culverhouse Castle, and that he might add con siderably to his income by so doing. But Kenrick repudiated the idea of an income so obtained.

At a cost of about a hundred and fifty pounds a year \u2014 nearly half his small income \u2014 Kenrick contrived to have the place kept decently; the gardens free from weeds and ruin; the empty stables protected from wind and rain; the house preserved from actual decay.

Love of his birthplace, and pride of his race, were the strongest points in Kenrick's character ; and Culverhouse was assuredly a home which a man with any sense of the beautiful might be pardoned for loving to enthusiasm. It had been a fortress in those early days when the Danish invader was marking his conquering course along the south-western coast with the blaze of burning villages. It had been an abbey before the Reforma tion, and much that belonged to its monastic period still remained. Some portions had been con verted to secular uses, other parts had been pre served in what might be;called a state of substantial ruin. And this mixture of ecclesiastical ruins and Tudor dwelling-house made a most picturesque and romantic whole. The massive outer wall of the cloistered quadrangle still remained, but where the cloisters had been was now the rose garden \u2014 a fair expanse of velvet turf, intersected with alleys of roses. The chapel door stood in all its early English purity of line and moulding, but the chapel had"], [221, "SIR kenrick's ancestral home. 213 given place to a sunny enclosure, bounded by hedges of honeysuckle and sweet-briar, a garden in which old-fashioned flowers grew luxuriantly in prim box-edged beds. The house was one of the handsomest in the county. Much too good for a decayed race, old Sir Kenrick had always said ; but young Sir Kenrick held it as in no wise too good for him. He woidd not have sold it for half a million, had he been free to sell it. The situation was perfect. It stood in a fertile green valley, on the bank of a river which, insignificant elsewhere, widened here to a noble reach of water, and curved lovingly round the velvet slopes of the lawn. A long wooden bridge spanned the river just beyond the old Gothic gateway of the castle, and communi- cated with the village of Culverhouse, in which a population of a hundred and eighty soids fancied itself a world. Kenrick loved the place \u2014 castle, village, river \u2014 low-lying water meadows \u2014 ancient avenues \u2014 fair green field where the foundations of the abbey had been marked out with rows of stones \u2014 a stone for each pillar in nave and aisles \u2014"], [222, "214 AN OPEN VERDICT. chancel and apse \u2014 he loved all these things with a love that was almost a passion. His heart thrilled Avithin him when he came back to the familiar scene after a year or more of exile. His nature, not too warm elsewhere, warmed to the old goodies and gaffers of Culverhouse village with an unalterable tenderness. Poor as he was, he had always stray sixpences and shillings in his waistcoat pocket to give these ancient rustics, for beer, or tea, or snuff. He could listen to their stories of rheumatics and other afflictions with infinite patience. Their very dialect was dear to him. If Kenrick had lived in the Middle Ages, and been exposed to visible contact with the powers of dark ness, Mephistopheles would have assuredly baited his hook Avith the Culverhouse estate. ' Here are the money-bags,' he Avould have said ; ' sign me this bond, and Culverhouse is yours, free of the mortgages that now degrade and humiliate your race.

He had promised his cousin Cyril that he would not attempt to become his rival, but he did not know hoAV far Cyril's love affair had gone. He had no idea that Beatrix had already made her choice, irrevocably, and was ready to sacrifice fortune and her father's favour for her lover. Kenrick was not in love with Beatrix Harefield, in spite of all those hints and inuendoes whereAvith Mrs. Dulcimer had artfully striven to kindle the fire of passion in his heart. He was not in love with her, but he admired her beyond any woman he had ever met, and he could but remember that her fortune Avould give him the desire of his heart.

But he would have been A-ery glad to marry a woman with money, provided he could think her the first of Avomen, and worthy to rule in the halls of his race. That he should love her was a secondary necessity. Sir Kenrick was not a young man avIio considered loving and being beloA-ed essential to the happiness of life. Nature had made him of colder stuff than his cousin Cyril. He could do very Avell Avithout love, but existence could hardly be tolerable to him Avithout Culverhouse Castle. He thought of Beatrix Harefield as he paced the long tapestried saloon on the evening of his arrival. He had ordered a fire to be lighted here, though old Mrs. Mopson, the major-domo's wife, had strongly recommended him to sit in the library, or his mother's morning-room. ' You'll be a deal snuggerer than in that there big room, Sir Kenrick,' she urged. ' I don't say it's damp, for I opens the windows every fine morning \u2014 but it's awful chill, and it 'd take a'most a stack of logs to warm it.'

' Ah,' said Betty, ' there ain't another room in Hampshire ekal to it,' firmly convinced that Hamp shire was the world, or at any rate all the world that was civilized and worth living in. Once, when some body asked Betty Mopson if she had ever been so far as London, she replied, ' No, thank God, I'm no furriner.' So Betty lighted a pile of logs on the open hearth, and put a pan of candles on the table near the fire, and wheeled a tapestried arm-chair beside it, and placed Sir Kenrick's slippers comfortably in front of the fender \u2014 so that in spite of its long dis use the room had a homelike aspect when he came to it after his homely dinner. By this dim light the room looked lovely \u2014 all its shabbiness hidden \u2014 all its beauties of form and colour intensified \u2014 the figures in the fine old tapestry standing out hi life like roundness.

Bella Scratchell went on devoting three after noons a week to parish visiting, in spite of paternal opposition. In fact, that paternal opposition gave a new zest to her work, and she felt herself in her small way a martyr. She told Cyril about her father's unkindness one afternoon as he was walking home with her, after an accidental meeting in one of the cottages.

There AAras a pause, and for some moments Mrs. Dulcimer thought of abandoning her idea of draAving Cyril out. The attempt might be premature. And there Avas poor Bella listening intently, no doubt, and having her young hopes blighted by the indifference of the curate's tone.

Beatrix Harefield's spirits improved in the society of her friend. She was fond of Bella, and believed in Bella's faithfulness and affection. Her reticence on the subject of Cyril Culverhouse had not arisen from distrust, but from a reserve natural in a girl reared in solitude, and with a mind lofty and ardent enough to make first love sacred as religion. But Avhen Bella, Avith every evidence of fondness, entreated to be taken into her friend's confidence, Beatrix Avas not so stoical as to refuse the comfort of sympathy7.

'He may do what he likes Avith it. Cyril will not marry me for my fortune.' ' Of course not, but fortune is a very good thing, and Mr. Culverhouse, Avho is poor, must think so.' This arrow glanced aside from the armour of Beatrix's faith. No one could have made her believe that her lover had any lurking greed of wealth. 'Then it is all settled,' said Bella, cheerfully. ' You will be of age in two years, and then you are to be married, whether Mr. Harefield likes or not. I really can't see why you should be unhappy.' ' I am not to see Cyril, or hear from him, for two years. He is going to leave this place in the spring. He might be ill \u2014 dying \u2014 and I should know nothing, till I took up the Times some morning and saw the advertisement of his death.' ' He is young and strong,' replied Bella. ' There is nothing less likely than that he should die. I don't think you need make yourself unhappy in advance about that.' Her cold hard tone wounded Beatrix, who had expected more sympathy. ' Don't let us talk about him, Bella,' she said."], [283, "MRS. PIPER'S TROUBLES. 275 But Bella Avas determined to talk about him till she had found out all that there was for her to know. She assumed a more sympathetic tone, and Beatrix Avas induced to tell of Cyril's interview with her father, and of the letter Avhich her lover wrote to her after that interview. The clocks struck eleven a few minutes after this conversation was ended. ' And now I must run to the Park and spend an hour Avith poor Mrs. Piper,' said Bella. ' I promised to go over every day to make myself useful. She is so Avretched about her servants, if there is no one to look after them.' ' How painful to have servants that require to be looked after!' said Beatrix, who was accustomed to a household that went as if by clockAvork, conducted by a butler an'd housekeeper who were trusted implicitly. ' It is rather dreadful,' replied Bella.

Beatrix went back to her quiet room, and her books. Her mind had been much widened by her intercourse Avith Mr. Dulcimer and his library, and good books Avere a consolation and delight to her. She had marked out a line of serious study, which she fancied might make her fitter to be Cyril's wife, and was resolved not to be led astray by any flowers of literature. Hard reading was a little difficult sometimes, for her thoughts would Avander to the lover from whom cruel fate had parted her ; but she persevered bravely, and astonished Miss Scales by the severity of her seK-discipline. Bella tripped briskly across the fields to Little Yafford Park, which was about half a mile from the village, and only a little less distant from the Water House. It was Saturday morning, and she knew that Mrs. Piper would be worried about the weekly bills, which had an unvarying tendency to be heavier than she expected to find them."], [285, "MRS.

His ambition was to see these children all educated up to the highest modern standard, and able to occupy an intellectual eminence from Avhich they could look doAvn upon everybody else. ' Money and dulness are sometimes supposed to go hand in hand,' said Mr. Piper. 'I shall take care that my children may be able to exhibit the pleasing spectacle of capital allied Avith intelli gence.' Unhappily the young Pipers did not take to educa tion quite so kindly as their father expected them to do. They had no thirst for the Pierian spring, and, instead of drinking deeply, imbibed the sacred Avaters in reluctant sips, as if the fount had been some nauseous sulphur spring offered to them medi cinally. Poor Bella had laboured almost hopelessly for the last year to drag Brougham through that Slough of Despond, Dr. Somebody's first Latin grammar, and had toiled valorously in the vain effort to familiarize Home Tooke with words of one syllable.

I like to have them with me, because it's a mother's duty, and I hope I shall do my duty to the last hour of my life. But they are very trying. Bentham has spilt the ink on the patchwork table-cover, and Mary has been pulling the Angola's tail most cruelly.' The animal which Mrs. Piper insisted on calling the ' Angola ' was a magnificent white Angora cat, and really the handsomest living creature in the Piper household ; indeed the Piper children seemed to have been invented as a foil to the grace and beauty of the cat, to Avhich they were inferior in every attribute, except the gift of speech, a privilege they systematically abused. Bella examined the injured table-cover, and stroked the offended cat, and then sat doAvn by Mrs. P iper's sofa."], [288, "280 AN OPEN VERDICT. ' I dare say the children are tiresome, dear Mrs. Piper,' she said, whereupon Bentham secretly put out his tongue at her, ' but it must be a comfort to you to see them all in such good health.' ' Yes, my dear, it is. But I really think there never were such boisterous children. I am sure when they were all down with the measles the house was like 'eaven. The wray they use the furniture is enough to provoke a saint. I some times wish Piper hadn't bought so many 'andsome ornaments for my boodwar.' And Mrs. Piper gave a heavy sigh, inwardly lamenting the ten-roomed villa in the broad high road outside Great Yafford \u2014 the best parlour which no one was allowed to enter \u2014 save on special occasions and under most restrictive conditions \u2014 and the everyday parlour, in which the shabby old furniture could hardly be the worse for ill-usage.

Look at the baker's book, Bella. It Avill freeze your blood.' Bella looked, and Avas not actually frozen, though the amount was startling. The household ex penses seemed to have been upon an ascending scale from the beginning of Mrs. Piper's illness. That careful housewife's seclusion had certainly relaxed the stringent economy by which larder and kitchen had been hitherto regulated. The tradesmen's books were gone through one by one, Mrs. Piper lamenting much, and doubtful of almost every item. Why so much lard and butter, why so many eggs ? There were mysterious birds in the poulterer's book, inexplicable fish in the fishmonger's. When they came to the butcher's book things grew desperate, and the cook was summoned to render an account of her doings. Cook was a plausible young woman in a smart cap, and she proved too much for Mrs. Piper. She had an explanation for every pound of meat in the book, and her mistress dared not push inquiry to the verge of accusation, lest this smart young"], [290, "282 AN OPEN VERDICT. Avoman should take advantage of the impending season and resign her situation then and there, leaving Mrs. Piper to get her Christmas dinner cooked as she might. Piper was particular about his dinner. It was the one sensual weakness of a great mind, and if his meals fell in any way short of his requirements and expectations, his family circle suffered. The simoom in the desert Avas not more sudden or devastating than the Avhirhvind of Mr. Piper's AATath in the dining-room, when the fish Avas sodden and sloppy, or the joint presented an interior stratum of rawness under an outer crust of scorched flesh. ' Piper is so particular,' his wife would remark piteously, ' and good cooks are so hard to get.' The fact of the case was that no good cook would endure Mrs. Piper's watchfulness and sus picion, and those scathing denunciations which Mr. Piper sent out by the parlour-maid when the dishes were not to his liking. ' I might have borne Mrs. Piper's petty prying Avays,' remarked one of the Park cooks, after giving her mistress warning, 'or I might have put up"], [291, "MRS. PIPER'S TROUBLES. 283 with Mr. Piper's tempers; but I couldn't stand him and her together. That was too much for Christian flesh and blood.' The cook was dismissed, with inward groanings on the part of Mrs. Piper, and the money for the tradesmen was entrusted to Bella, Avho was to pay the bills on her way through the village, and to make divers complaints and objections Avhich the cook might have omitted to deliver. ' I never let a servant pay my bills if I can help it,' said Mrs. Piper, ' it gives them too much power.' And Mrs. Piper gave another sigh for the days of old, when her villa in the Great Yafford Road had been kept as neat as a pin by two servants, and those two servants had been completely under their mistress's thumb, when she herself had given her orders by word of mouth to the tradespeople, and not so much as a half-quartern loaf had come into the house Avithout her knowledge and consent. The transition from the tight economies of mediocre comfort to the larger splendour of unlimited wealth had been a sore trial to Mrs. Piper. The"], [292, "284 AN OPEN VERDICT. change had come too late in her life. She could not reconcile herself to the cost of her grandeur, although her husband assured her that he was not spending half his income. ' It may be so now, Piper,' she replied, dubiously, ' but when the children grow up you'll find yourself spending more money. They'll eat more, and their boots will come dearer. I feel the difference every year.' ' When I find myself with less than fifty thousand surplus capital, I shall begin to grumble, Moggie,' said Mr. Piper, ' but I ain't going to make a poor mouth till then.' ' Well, Piper, of course it's nice to live in a big place like this, and to feel oneself looked up to, and that the best of everything is hardly good enough for us ; but still there are times when I feel as if you and me had been sent into the world to feed a pack of extravagant servants.' ' We can't help that, my dear,' ansAvered Piper, cheerily. ' Dukes and duchesses are the same.' ' Ah, but then you see dukes and duchesses are bom to it.

' Don't be a fool, Moggie,' retorted the manufac turer, unmoved by this pathetic suggestion. ' When I was in business I've lost five thousand pounds in a morning by the turn of the market, and I've come home and eat my dinner and never said a word to you about it.

Mrs. Piper had been a very fair sample of this pink and Avhite order of beauty, when the rising manufacturer married her; but time and ill-health and a natural fretful ness had destroyed good looks which consisted chiefly of a fine complexion and a plump figure, and the Mrs. Piper of the present was far from lovely. Her Ebenezer was not the less devoted to her on that account. He bought her fine dresses, and every possible combination of ormolu and malachite, mother-o' -pearl and tortoiseshell, for her boudoir and drawing-room ; and he told everybody that she had been a good wife to him, and a pretty Avoman in her time, ' though nobody would believe it to look at her now.'

' She's been bothering over those trades men's books this morning, I'll warrant, just as she used fifteen years ago when I allowed her five pounds a week for the housekeeping. She never did take kindly to a large establishment. She's been wearing her life out about fiddle-faddle ever since we came here \u2014 and yet she had set her heart on being a great lady.

His conservatory was an object of interest to him in his present comparatively idle life. He knew all the Latin names, and the habits of all the plants. He cut off some of the blossoms that Avere on the wane, and presented them to Bella, talking about himself and his wife and children all the while. She had a hard struggle to get away, for Mr. Piper approved of her, just as Dr. Johnson approved of Kitty Clive, as a nice little thing to sit beside one, or, in other words, a good listener. Bella got back to the Water House in time for luncheon, a meal which the two girls took together in a snug breakfast parlour on the ground floor. The dining-room was much too large for the possibility of cheerfulness.

Great Yafford on a December afternoon was about as ugly a toAvn as one need care to see ; but it was busy and prosperous, and seemed to take an honest pride in its ugliness, so stoutly did its vestry and corporation oppose any move ment hi the direction of beauty. There was one street of ample breadth and length, intersected by a great many narrow streets. There was a grimy looking canal, along which still grimier coal barges crept stealthily under the dull gray sky. There were great piles of buildings devoted to the pur poses of commerce ; factories, warehouses, gas w7orks, dye works, oil works, soap Avorks, bone works, all vying with one another in hideousness, and in the production of unsavoury odours.

She went in this way to no less than six chemists' shops, entering each alone, and remaining for about five minutes in each. She had a good many little daintily sealed white parcels by the time she had finished this round. 'Are you going to set up as a doctor?' Bella asked, laughing.

The Repository was a kind of bazaar in Tower Gate, where there was a large selection of useless articles at any price from sixpence to a guinea.

' Upon my word, Beatrix, you are too good,' exclaimed Bella, Avhen she heard the destination of these objects.

A WITNESS FROM THE GRAVE. The two girls at the Water House lived their solitary life all through the dark week before Christmas. They read a great deal ; Bella confining herself to the novels from the Great Yafford library, Beatrix reading those books which she believed were to fit her for companionship with Cyril Culverhouse in the days to come. They did not find so much to say to each other as friends of such long standing might have been expected to find. But Beatrix was by nature reserved about those things nearest her heart, and her cloistered life gave her little else to talk about.

For fine days there was the garden, and for variety Puck and the pony carnage. Miss Harefield took her friend for long drives across the moor. Once they met Cyril in one of the lanes, and passed him with a distant recognition. Bella saw Beatrix's cheek grow pale as he came in sight. ' How white you turned just now,' she said, Avhen Puck had carried them ever so far aAvay from the curate of Little Yafford. ' Did I ? ' asked Beatrix. ' I don't think I can be as pale as you. That was sympathy, I suppose. You felt how hard it was for me to pass him by.' ' Yes,' answered Bella in her quiet little way, ' that was what I felt.' Bella had been staying at the Water House a Aveek and during that time had seen Mr. Harefield about half a dozen times. He was in the habit of dining with his daughter and her governess on Sun days. It was not a pleasant change in his hermit like life, but he made this sacrifice to paternal duty. Every Sunday at four o'clock he sat down to dinner Avith Iris daughter and Miss Scales.

He looked from one to the other thoughtfully7 while he unfolded his napkin, as if he were not quite clear as to which was his daughter, and then, having made up his mind on that point, addressed himself with a slight turn of the head to Beatrix. ' Your friend has grown very much,' he said. ' Do you really think so, Mr. Harefield ? ' inquired Bella, with a gratified simper. It was something to be spoken of in any wise by this modern Timon. Mr. Harefield went on helping the soup without a word. He had quite forgotten his OAvn remark, and had not heard Bella's. They got half-way through the dinner in absolute silence. Then a tart and a pudding appeared, and the tart, being set down rather suddenly before Mr. Harefield, seemed to dis turb him in the midst of a waking dream. ' Have you heard from Miss Scales ?' he asked his daughter abruptly."], [311, "A WITNESS FROM THE GRAVE. 303 ' Yes, papa. I have had two letters. Her aunt is very ill.

The old butler moved quietly to and fro. There was a gentle jingle of glass and silver now and then, like the ringing of distant sleigh-bells. The wood ashes fell softly from the wide old grate. The clock ticked in the hall out side. Time halted like a cripple.

Here there Avas a suppressed and solemn gloom, as of a tempest alw7ays impending and never coming. What a waste of Avealth and luxury it seemed to sit in a fine old room like this, surrounded by all good things, and to be obstinately wretched ! When dinner was over, and certain dried fruits and pale half-ripened oranges had been carried round by the butler's subordinate, the butler himself following solemnly Avith decanters and claret jug, and nobody taking anything, the two girls rose, at a look from Beatrix, and left Mr. Harefield alone.

The only piano in the house was ever so far away in the lumber-room, and the lumber-room after dark was suggestive of ghosts and goblins, or at any rate of rats and mice. Sunday evening at the parish church was gayer than this, Bella thought, as she sat by the fire stifling her frequent yawns, and Avatched Beatrix's thoughtful face bending over Bishop Ken.

The clock ticked, the gray wood ashes dropped upon the hearth, just as they had done in the dining room. Outside the deep casement AvindoAvs the night Avinds were blowing, the ragged tree-tops SAvaying against a cold gray sky. Bella shivered as she sat by the fire. This was the dreariest Sunday evening she had ever spent. Presently a shrill bell pealed loudly through the house, a startling sound amidst a silence which seemed to have lasted for ages, nay, to be a normal condition of one's existence. Bella gave a little jump, and sat up in her chair alert and eager. ' Could it be Cyril Culverhouse ? No, of course not.' His image filled so large a place in her life that even the sudden ringing of a bell suggested his approach, till reason came to check the vagaries of fancy. The same thought darted into Beatrix's mind. For a woman deeply in love, earth holds only one man \u2014 her lover. Was it Cyril who came to"], [315, "A WITNESS FROM THE GRAVE. 307 claim her ; to trample doAvn the barrier of paternal authority, and to claim her by the right of their mutual love ? This idea being, at the first flash of reason, utterly untenable, lasted no longer with Beatrix than it had done Avith Bella. ' It must be Miss Scales,' she said, going to the door. ' And yet I should not have thought she would traA-el on a Sunday. She is so very particular about Sunday.' Miss Scales belonged to a sect w7ith whom God's day of rest means a day of penance ; a day upon which mankind holds itself in an apologetic attitude toAvards its Maker, as if deprecating the DiA-ine wrath for its audacity in having taken the lib.iaty to be born. The tAvo girls went out into the corridor, and from the corridor to the square open gallery in the middle of the house, from which the broad staircase descended.

Then there came another peal of the bell, and the butler"], [316, "308 AN OPEN VERDICT. Avalked slowly across to the door, and opened it just Avide enough to reconnoitre the visitor. Here there was a brief parley, the drift of Avhich the girls could not distinguish. They only heard a murmur of masculine voices. ' It can't be Miss Scales,' Avhispered Beatrix. 'They Avould have brought in her portmanteau before this.' The parley ceased all at once, the butler threw open the door, and a gentleman came in out of the windy night, bringing a blast of cold air with him. He took off his hat, and stood in the centre of the hall, looking about him, while the butler carried his card to Mr. Harefield. The stranger was a man of about fifty, tall and spare of figure, but with a certain nobility of bearing, as of one accustomed to command. The finely shaped head Avas beautifully set upon the shoulders, the chest was broad and deep. As he looked upAvards the two girls drew back into, the shadow, still watch ing him. It was a beautiful head, a grand Italian face full of tranquillity and power, like a portrait by"], [317, "A WITNESS FROM THE GRAVE. 309 Moroni. The eyes were dark, the skin was a pale olive, the hah ' a sable silvered.' A thrill Avent through Beatrix's heart as she looked at him. Yes, she remembered, she knew. This was Antonio. This was the Italian with the pathetic voice, who sat in the twilight, singing church music, that summer evening long ago. This was the man whose face memory associated -with the face of her dead mother. She had seen them look ing at her together in those days of early child hood, whose faint memories are like a reminiscence of some anterior state of being, a world known before earth. The butler came back. ' My master will see you, sir/ The stranger folloAved him out of the hall. Beatrix and Bella could hear the footsteps travel ling slowly along the passage to the library. ' Who can he be ? ' exclaimed Miss Scratchell, full of curiosity. 'Perhaps he is a relation of your papa's,' she added, speculatively, Beatrix having ignored her first remark. Beatrix remained silent. She Avas thinking of"], [318, "310 AN OPEN A-ERDICT. the miniature in her mother's room, the youthful likeness of the face she had seen to-night. Who Avas this man ? Her mother's kinsman, perhaps? But why had his presence brought sorrow and severance between husband and wife? Little as she knew of the hard facts that made up the history of her mother's life, there was that in Beatrix's memory which told her this man had been the cause of evil. She roused herself with an effort, and went back to her room, followed by Bella, who had broken out into fresh yawns on finding that the advent of the stranger promised no relief to the dulness of the evening. 'Eight o'clock,' she said, as the old clock in the hall announced that fact, embellishing a plain truth Avith a little burst of old-fashioned melody. ' They are coming out of church by this time.

Perhaps a cup of tea may enliven us.' ' Well, the urn is company at any rate,' assented Bella, as the servant set down the oblong silver tray, with its buff and gold Bristol cups and saucers, and the massive old urn, dimly suggestive of sisterly affection in the person of Electra, or needing only a napkin neatly draped across it to recall the sculptured monuments of a modern cemetery. ' Now, really,' pursued Bella, while Beatrix was making tea, ' have you no idea who that foreign looking gentleman is?' ' Why should I trouble myself about him ? He comes to see papa, not me.' 'Yes, but one can't help being curious so long as one is human. By the time my inquisitiveness is worn out I shall be an angel. Your papa has so few visitors ; and this one has such a distin guished appearance. I feel sure he is some one of importance.' ' Very likely.' 'My dear Beatrix, this lonely life of yours is making you dreadfully stoical,' remonstrated Bella."], [320, "312 AN OPEN VERDICT. 'I should be glad to become stoical. This stranger's visit cannot make any difference to me. It Avill not make my father love me any better, or feel more kindly disposed toAvards Cyril. It may make him a little worse perhaps.

In the library the two men were standing face to face \u2014 men who had not met for more than ten years, who had parted in anger too deep for words.

His jealousy had been aroused by the sight of a face he hated, looking out of a travelling carriage that whirled by them in a cloud of white dust on the sunny mountain road.

It was at a party in Florence \u2014 at the house of an Italian Countess \u2014 literary \u2014 artistic \u2014 dilettante\u2014 a party at which the rooms were crowded, and people went in and out and complained of the heat, while large and splendid Italian matrons \u2014 with eyes that one would hardly hope to see, save on the canvas of Guido, sat in indolent grace on the broad crimson divans, languidly fanning themselves, and murmuring soft scandals under cover of the music. There was much music at the Countess Circignani's, and that night a young novice \u2014 the daughter of a Colonel in the Italian army \u2014 was led to the piano by the fair hand of the Countess herself, who entreated silence for her protegee.

He, Christian Harefield, the travelling English-"], [331, "323 A WITNESS FROM THE GRAVE. man, stood among the crowd and watched the fab- face of the singer. He Avas struck with its beauty and sweetness ; but his was not a nature prone to sudden passions. This was to be no new instance of love kindled by a single glance, swift as fire from a burning glass. Before the evening was ended, Mr. Harefield had been presented to Colonel Murano, and by the Colonel to the fair singer. The soldier was a patriot, burning for the release of his country from the Austrian yoke \u2014 full of grand ideas of uni- fication, glorious hopes that pointed to Rome as the capital of a united Italy. He found the Englishman interested in the Italian question, if not enthusiastic. i He was knoAvn to be rich, and therefore worthy to be cultivated. Colonel Murano cultivated him assidu- ously, gave him the entrance to his shabby but patriotic salon, where Mr. Harefietd listened cour teously while patriots with long hair, and patriots with short hair, discussed the future of Italy.

There was a nephew, a soldier and an enthusiast like his uncle, who spent all his evenings in the Colonel's salon, singing with Beatrix Murano, or Hstening while she sang. From the hour in which he first loved Beatrix, Christian Harefield hated this cousin, with the grave, dark face, sympathetic manners, and exquisite tenor voice. In him the Englishman saw his only rival. Later, this young soldier, Antonio Murano, left Florence on military duty. The coast was clear, Mr. Harefield offered himself to the Colonel as a husband for his daughter \u2014 the Colonel responded warmly. He could wish no happier alliance for his only girl. She was young \u2014 her heart had never been touched. She could scarcely fail to reciprocate an attachment which did her so much honour. ' Are you sure of that V asked Christian Harefield.

He kept his opinion; but passion was stronger than prudence, and a week after he had made his offer to the father he proposed to the daughter.

Her husband, at first doting, though always suspicious, indulged this reasonable desire. At Florence they met the soldier cousin. He and Mrs. Harefield's father both belonged to the patriot party. Both believed that the hour for casting off the Austrian yoke was close at hand. Colonel Murano's salon was the rendezvous of all the Carbonari in the city. It was a political club. Mrs. Harefield shared the enthusiasm of her father and her cousin, and even her husband's stern nature was moved to sympathy with a cause so noble. Then, by a slow and gradual growth, jealousy took root in the husband's heart, and strangled every better feeling. He began to see in his wife's love for Florence a secret hankering after an old lover. He set himself to watch, and the man who watches always sees something to suspect. His own eyes create the monster. By and by, Antonio Murano came to England on a secret mission to an exiled"], [335, "327 A WITNESS FROM THE GRAVE. chief of the patriot party, and naturally went north ward to visit his cousin. He was received with outward friendship but inward distrust. Then came scenes of suppressed bitterness between husband and wife \u2014 a sleepless watchfulness that imagined evil in every look and word, and saw guilt in actions the most innocent. A life that was verily hell upon earth. Later there followed positive accusations \u2014 the open charge of infidelity ; and, in the indignation kindled by groundless allegations, Christian Hare field's wife confessed that she had never loved him, that she had sacrificed her own inclinations for the benefit of her family. She confessed further that she had loved Antonio Murano ; but declared at the same time, with tears of mingled anger and shame, that no word had ever been spoken by either of them since her marriage which her husband could blame. ' You have seen him. He has been your chosen companion and friend,' cried Christian Harefield. ' If you had meant to be true to me you would never have seen his face after your marriage. Had you been honest and loyal I would have forgiven"], [336, "328 AN OPEN VERDICT. you for not loving me. I Avill never forgive you for deceiving me.' From that hour there was no longer even the semblance of love between them. On Mr. Harefield's part there was an ill- concealed aversion which ex tended even to his child. Finally came that last Italian journey \u2014 necessitated by the wife's fast fail ing health \u2014 and with that journey the end. They went this time not to Florence, Mrs. Harefield's beloved home, but to Venice, where she was a stranger. From Venice they were to go to Rome for the winter, and it was while they were travelling towards Rome that the catastrophe came. Christian Harefield believed that his wife had left him with her cousin \u2014 that the whole thing had been deliberately planned between them, Captain Murano following them southward from Venice. This was the bitter past upon which Christian Harefield looked back as he sat before his solitary hearth that wintry night. The story of his Avedded life passed before him like a series of pictures.

They were doomed to be miserable. It was long before he read the Reverend Mothers statement. The clock had struck more than once. His servant had come in for the last time, bringing a fresh supply of wood. The doors had been locked and barred. The household had gone to bed. It was the dead of night before Mr. Harefield aroused himself from that long reverie, and opened the sealed paper which was to confirm Antonio Murano's story. He read it slowly and thoughtfully, and believed it. What motive could any one have for deceiving him, now, after all these years, when the griefs and passions of the past were dead things\u2014 like a handful of gray dust in a funeral urn ? He rose and paced the room for a long time, deep in thought, holding the Superior's letter in his hand. Then, as if moved by a sudden resolution, he seated himself at his table, and began to write a letter. It was brief \u2014 but he was long in writing it, and when it was done he sat for some time with the"], [338, "330 AN OPEN VERDICT. letter lying before him \u2014 and his eyes fixed \u2014 as if his mind had gone astray into deep thickets and jungles of conflicting thought. Then, as if again influenced by a sudden determination, he folded his letter and put it, with the Reverend Mother's state ment, into a large envelope. This he addressed curiously, thus : \u2014 ' For my daughter Beatrix.' Then, leaving this letter on the table, he lighted a candle and went upstairs to the long passage out of which his wife's rooms opened. He unlocked the door of her sitting-room and went in.
