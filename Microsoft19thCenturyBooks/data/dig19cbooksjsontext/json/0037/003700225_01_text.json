If anything else were wanted to add to the attractions of the little town, it is supplied by the fact that it is situated in the midst of the most thoroughly English and lovable of England's rural scenery. It has undergone few changes during the last three hundred years, and on it many an appreciative line and phrase of its great son makes fitting commentary. Every year, and all through the year, but par ticularly when the green and beautiful Warwick shire landscape is touched with the glory of summer and autumn, crowds of pilgrims from all lands flock to pay homage to the genius of the dramatist whose fame is world-wide. The strangers A"], [14, "The American Cousins 2 stand with uncovered heads in the wool-stapler's house, in the quaintly uncouth little room in which the child first saw the light. They tread the street he trod, and visit the ancient grammar school in which he conned his horn book. They wander longingly in the Memorial Garden, occupying the site of his fair mansion of New Place, which his pen and his playing won for him. They stray through the pleasant pastures or by the shady roads to the most picturesque of old cottages in which he wooed his bride. If the pilgrims are blest with leisure, they go yet farther afield to the house which was his mother's maiden home, or to the wooded park and old English manor house, which represented at once to the young poet's glowing fancy the Forest of Ardennes and the hall of Justice Shallow. They linger last in the storied church by the softly flowing Avon, where the bust which is his best likeness is to be found, and where his undisturbed dust is a sacred trust to his country and to the whole civilised world. On a long, cloudless June day in the eighties, there came a pair of sightseers, young men, equally ardent, except that the younger of the two poured forth his enthusiasm and delight with a generous frankness and confidence liable to be mistaken by the carping critic for \"gush,\" while the elder af fected a nil admirari tone, and assumed an air of mingled stolidity and swagger such as became a countryman of Mark Twain's. Both were good looking, gentleman-like fellows, bearing a sufficient likeness to each other to mark them as brothers. The elder, rather more than a lad in years, had"], [15, "The American Cousins 3 certain traits which, to an initiated native of the Republic flourishing under the \" Stars and Stripes,\" would have signified emphatically an origin \" down south \" \u2014 to begin with, at least. The younger, with closely-cropped chestnut hair matching his bright hazel eyes, was dressed with a scrupulous atten tion to English precedent. The elder, with darker hair, worn a little longer than the present convict fashion, and with grey instead of hazel eyes, was a citizen of the world in his loose coat and broad brimmed straw hat. The younger displayed an immature version of the moustache and beard of the golden youth of the period. The elder had the close-shaven brown face of an older genera tion of Americans. The couple were George and Beville Sheldrake, \" planters \" in Virginia, descendants from one of the oldest families in their state. Of course, their father, uncles, cousins and neighbours had taken the side of the South in the Civil War, and, of course, many a rice field had been swamped and cotton planta tion gone to wreck and ruin as the result. But the very fact that the Sheldrake brothers were on a pleasure tour for a couple of years in Europe was a proof that the family, like the mass of the community, had long ago recovered largely from the severity of the contest, the defeat of the Southerns, and the abolition of the slave trade. The young men had gone the usual round of sight-seeing at Stratford-on-Avon, what was peculiar in their case was that even before they had exhausted the Shakespearean relics, the brothers were as eager \u2014 the younger without concealment, the elder under a veil of good-"], [16, "The American Cousins 4 humoured chaffing of his junior's excitement \u2014 to inspect certain monumental figures in a family pew, over a family vault in the church. The visitors took it upon them to tell the verger \u2014 considerably to his surprise and discomfiture \u2014 instead of waiting till he told them, what they had come for. \" It is the Sheldrake monument we wish to see,\" explained Beville Sheldrake, with unnecessary emphasis and precision, \" the monument which is in the centre of the family pew, and bears the recumbent figures of Sir Beville Sheldrake and his wife, Cordel Shenstone. They were contem poraries of your immortal Will, having lived in the same reign of Elizabeth ; you cannot mistake what we are in search of.\" \" Of course not, sir,\" replied the aggrieved official, feeling his prerogative invaded ; \" most folks wishes to see the Sheldrake monument after they have done with Shakespeare. It is a most extraordinary con temporaneous monument, which I should not, on no account, have forgotten in showing the church,\" he ended in scarcely suppressed indignation. ' There ! you've put your foot into it as usual, Bev, with your unseemly haste,\" muttered the elder brother in an undertone, while the two traversed the aisles, at the heels of the verger, \" you've no right to take the word out of a man's mouth, the word which it is his privilege to speak, which he is paid for speaking, so that to say his say is a matter of conscience with him. You've done worse than hurt his feelings, the old rascal is troubled in his mind as well as mortally of fended.\""], [17, "The American Cousins 5 But even George Sheldrake ceased to indulge in slang and badinage as the two strangers from a far country stood motionless at the foot of the fine monument, in the centre of the square pew, whose occupants gazed Sunday after Sunday, year upon year, century in and century out, on the effigies of their predecessors. These were in dim and discoloured alabaster \u2014 a knight, not in warlike armour, but in the ruff, doublet and trunk hose of peace, with the furred mantle of his rank, and the jewelled collar and order of his offices as a courtier and statesman ; while by his side lay the companion figure of a lady in coif, stomacher and farthingale, having her taper fingers joined in prayer, though on her high features, worn by time, there lingered to this day still more of the pride of the aristocrat than the piety of the devotee. Was there a shadow of resemblance be tween the alabaster mask and the finely-cut face in warm flesh and blood of the younger man bending eagerly over the effigy ? Could a strain of- blood survive all foreign admixture for fully three hundred years ? If so, the likeness might exist, for Beville Sheldrake, the namesake of Eliza beth's courtier, with his brother, whose face had missed the delicate chiselling preserved in the alabaster, was the lineal descendant, through an intervening line of planters and settlers in Virginia, of the elder son of the English knight and lady, whose dust rested beneath the sumptuous monu ment erected in their honour. \" Sir Beville Sheldrake of Oakspur and Dame Cordel, his wife,\" ran on the voice of the verger, who had so far recovered his equanimity as to have"], [18, "The American Cousins 6 fallen back into his professional sing-song. \"Sir Beville was one of Queen Elizabeth's council the year of the defeat of the Armada. He is thought to have impoverished the estate by the subsidies he furnished, and the caravels he manned in the service of his country. He had his reward in being appointed to more than one government office in his day. The last he held was under Essex in Ireland. The family still own the manor of Oakspur, and are represented at present by William Sheldrake, Esquire, who succeeded his father, the late squire, in 1880. The estate has de scended in the male line since Henry the Eighth's reign. The succession has never been broken.\" \" Ah ! \" exclaimed George Sheldrake, abruptly. The exclamation might have been an assent or a protest, as the listener was supposed to take it. \" Oakspur is not far from this,\" remarked Beville Sheldrake, more as an assertion than as an inter rogation. \" About five miles off,\" corroborated the verger, \"but,\" he added with the manner of a man making a stiffreservation, \" though it is held by connoisseurs to be a very good example of the old English manor house, it has never been made a show place. It is not exhibited to the public even when the family ain't at home, which don't occur often, for the late squire's widow stays there with her four daughters most all the year round, keeping house for the young squire till he gets a wife, which won't be long, I take it, since he came of age nigh six years agone.' The Sheldrakes from the other side of the Atlantic said no more, not even Beville, with his"], [19, "The American Cousins 7 reputed impulsiveness and effusiveness, felt inclined to disclose the identity of their family name, far less to indulge in such an explanation, as that the recumbent Sir Beville's elder son Humphrey, having been implicated in one of the many plots of James First's reign, had fled across the seas and never re turned. Not only he, his entire race, for he had married and settled in the State of Virginia, leaving behind him a large family with its numerous rami fications, had failed, from various reasons, to revisit the Mother Country. Hard to understand, as it sounded, George and Beville Sheldrake were the first American Sheldrakes who had come to England in the course of three centuries. No intercourse had been kept up with the English branch of the house since Humphrey Sheldrake awoke the wrath of his kindred and covered them with disgrace by his political misadventure. The American Sheldrakes were not even aware if the English Sheldrakes were acquainted with the fact of their existence. The expatriated descendants of Sir Beville and Dame Cordel had the advantage here, for they were in possession of Humphrey Sheldrake's \" papers,\" carefully stowed away in a French cabinet in the oldest quarter of what still remained of his original log-house, swallowed up by its innumerable additions. Among the family relics was a tattered old print of the manor house of Oakspur, and a battered silver drinking-cup which had once belonged to Humphrey, the plotter and exile. Having accomplished the first part of their pro gramme, the pair of sightseers did according to the usual practice of visitors, they strolled round"], [20, "The American Cousins 8 the church to admire the fine trees dipping into the Avon. The present couple ended by sitting down in the shade to rest, smoke the pipe of peace, compare notes, and consult like the trusty comrades they were. Their very unlikeness served to form a bond of union, which the cement of kindred blood made closer and firmer. The look, half of satisfaction, half of faint disappointment, which waits on the realisation of most long-cherished earthly projects \u2014 a languid sense of mingled success and failure \u2014 lingered on the handsome, sensitive face of the younger man. It calmed his excitement, but it helped to provoke an attack from his companion. \" Well, Bev, are we to have no more bunkum ? Have we enthused and excursed enough for one bout ? Was it worth crossing the ' herring-pond ' for? My opinion is, that venerable wool-stapler must have had uncommonly poor notions where light and space were concerned to coop up his family in such odd holes and corners \u2014 not to speak of the break-neck stairs to reach the upper storey. He, mayor of the town too, shabby old beggar. Depend upon it, he was a miserly hunks and kept the family on short commons, and so his son Will was reduced to deer-stealing.\" \" Stop that, George,\" said Beville, knitting his brown brows imperatively, while he was too lazy to move the arms stretched above his head, so that it might rest against his clasped hands. \" The place is as perfect as a place can be in this blessed world, where nothing exactly answers our expecta tions, no doubt ' for our goods,' as the old Bruns wickers said. I could have come twice the distance"], [21, "The American Cousins 9 for a sight of these alabaster figures which were set up in old Humphrey Sheldrake's day, at his charges, as he has put down in his diary.\" \" The more fool you,\" said George, remorselessly. \" A brace of yellow scarecrows in stage trappings. You may be glad there is a little sense left in one of us. I am thankful to say I never was far gone in eclecticism.\" The reader is informed here that George Sheldrake was as wTell acquainted with the Queen's English, and spoke it as correctly when he chose as it was spoken and \" understanded \" by any other young American of his social standing. But it somehow pleased him to tickle the fastidious ears of his younger brother and to astonish strangers by any amount of native colloquialisms \u2014 with regard to which he was not at all particular whether they were up to date or whether they came from the North or the South. His slang might be old or it might be new, it might be drawn from New York or from New Orleans. Either way it answered his purpose quite well. Withal, there was no radical irreverence in the man's character. What his brother said of him was emphatically true. \" Old George is not half a bad fellow, if he did not go in for being a philosopher, and patronise a lingo which is no more modern Yankee of one brew than it is modern, unadulterated Greek.\" There was a pause, broken by no sound save the chirping of birds, the swaying of reeds, the stirring of leaves, and the murmur of that river which once upon a time sang never-to-be-forgotten songs to an ear long closed to its varied melody. \" Hark ! hark ! the lark at Heaven's gate sings.\""], [22, "The American Cousins 10 \" Willow, willow.\" \" Where daisies pied and violets blue.\" \" Blow, blotv, thou winter wind.\" \"Well, what is to be the next move, young Obadiah ? \" asked George, as he bit at a spike of grass. \" We had better be thinking of something, were it only of going back to inspect our ' munifi cent countryman's ' fountain, or of turning in at the inn, since we don't mean to camp out by this ditch \u2014 shade of the Potomac ! to call it a river ! \" \"I should like nothing better,\" said Beville, fervently, while his bright hazel eyes looked around, and began to acquire the far-away ex pression of an inveterate dreamer \u2014 dreaming while wide awake. \" Not if I can help it,\" said George, springing up with decision, \" after the fever you had in the fall. Besides, we're not at home even if we had a tent and all the fixings handy. We're in the land of fine effects from damp and shivers. The ditch ain't dry, unfortunately ; a single night of it would leave you a gone coon. No, rather knock under, hire a buggy or its substitute, drive out and beard our aristocratic cousins at Oakspur. We'll have the door shut in our faces, I guess. They'll think us a rare pair of impostors. But never mind, you'll see the outside of the hoary abode of our narrow minded, truculent forefathers which you're eter nally hankering after. I bet, if you're honest, you'll admit it is far inferior to the old house in Virginia.\" Beville did not take up the bet. \"Why should our cousins not receive us civilly, at least ? \" he inquired, still lying on the ground. \" We've buried"], [23, "The American Cousins 11 the hatchet ages ago ; we don't come here to assert our prior claims.\" \" Our prior claim, indeed,\" echoed George, with a laugh. \" Sakes ! it has slept too long even if it rested on a stronger foundation than a few mouldering old papers, which only an expert could be clear were not clever forgeries. Possession is nine-tenths of the law, and the younger branch has been in possession for nearly three centuries ! It would be a new joke in law to turn them out at this date, even if the game were worth the candle.\" \" It would be well worth the candle to me,\" said Beville, with a warmth of regret, \" though I know the thing is impossible, and it would have been a cruel hardship to the holders of the property if it had remained an open question. But if they are satisfied that we see the matter like rational beings and have no need to\u2014 to \u2014 \" \" To sorn on them.\" George supplied the word composedly. \" Well, then, their timid minds might be quieted down on that score. But ten to one they won't believe we haven't a design of grinding our own axe, or, I say, old man, they may be ashamed of us as provincials, Brother Sams, and so forth. Never mind, we'll turn the tables, and show them their ' tight little island ' is a thunder ing petty affair compared to the almighty States.\" \" Where would the almighty States have been without the ' tight little island ' to set them ago ing ? '' demanded Beville. \" Oh ! I guess some other island or continent would have given them the shove,\" replied George, carelessly, and then he went on as Beville rose reluctantly, and the brothers strolled back to their"], [24, "The American Cousins 12 inn. \" I say, youngster, did you lay to heart what the man with the tongue at Warwick let out when you sounded him about the Sheldrakes of Oakspur, that they would have been as poor as church mice if the late squire had not married a fortune in the shape of the daughter of a London merchant \u2014 tradesman, I take it. Oh, our quarterings on this side of the water are not so impeccable as might have been expected. I don't know that our southern 'Lallas,' with Spanish blood in their veins, and our northern ' Prisses,' imported before the war, though they were simply planters' and farmers' daughters, were not a match for this mercantile lady, apart from her fortune.\" \"We shall see,\" said Beville, briefly. \"I don't want to disparage our mothers and grandmothers by any means. I am an American as well as you, and I'm proud enough of the distinction and the rest of it. But there is no need to deny that there is a special charm to me in a Sheldrake of Oak spur, a member of the old race still in its old setting, let the member be man or woman, matron or maid.\""], [25, "13 CHAPTER II A FAMILY COUNCIL IN THE MORNING-ROOM AT OAKSPUR Oakspur, the seat of the English Sheldrakes, was not, and had never been, a feudal castle. The discovery might have inflicted a severe shock on Beville Sheldrake when the American brothers made their descent on Warwickshire had it not been for the old print of the manor house which Humphrey Sheldrake had happened to carry with him in his flight. The print represented the gables, wide porch and single turret, when they were com paratively modern, in their homely dignity as the simple dwelling-place of simple country gentlemen. For it was only now and again that one of its squires won his spurs and obtained the rich mantle and jewelled collar of a courtier and statesman in the days when courtiers and statesmen witched the world in velvet and brocade, plumed beavers or glittering helmets, with costly keys of office dangling from the massive gold chains on the wearers' padded breasts. Various additions had been made to the old manor house, all in tolerable keeping with its original character, and now, when age had set its"], [26, "The American Cousins 14 seal on its clock tower and broad terrace over looking its pleasant park, when even the dark green leaves and white stars of the jessamine covering one gable, and the soft gray -green trails of the vine mantling over the porch, were vener able specimens of their different kinds, it was, as the verger of the Stratford church had said, a good example of an old English country house. It was calculated in itself to delight the susceptible soul of an Anglo-maniac like Beville Sheldrake ; it was doubly delightful to him as the home of his fathers. The interior of Oakspur was as modestly and daintily picturesque as its exterior. It was pre served with the jealous care wThich knows how to prize at its proper value each delicately worn sign of real antiquity. It was in the morning-room, with its black, oak-panelled walls, its high mantel piece, its equally high windows, having window seats and small bookcases lodged beneath them, its queer cupboards and unaccountable recesses, that the family were gathered together on just such a June day as that which had seen the American cousins hovering about the classic town and statued church in the neighbourhood. The family was represented by Mrs Sheldrake, the widow of the late and the mother of the present squire, with her two elder daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, girls of twenty-two and twenty. The two younger girls, Dorothy and Eleanor, in the beginning of their teens, had been decreed by their mother, much to their indignant surprise, as not sufficiently mature in years and judgment to be included in a family council, which was to deal"], [27, "The American Cousins 15 with a matter of serious and painful import. Dorothy and Eleanor indemnified themselves by hanging about the scene in which they were not permitted to play a part, walking and talking in the corridor outside the room, and repeatedly crossing, with interlaced arms \u2014 the attitude sig nificant of an alliance offensive and defensive against a common insult \u2014 across a corner of the lawn, in full view of one or other of the windows of the morning-room. The young squire was also absent. Indeed, seeing that his crying delinquency was the grave subject on which the council was held, his absence was well nigh inevitable. Mrs Sheldrake resembled her eldest daughter Mary, and was a woman of few and fixed ideas. She was rather a fine-looking woman in a large style \u2014 a monumental style when taken in con junction with the widow's weeds, which she had worn, with certain modifications, since the date of her husband's death. She was fortunate, so far, in having to wear black instead of colour, and in being warranted in adopting draperies rather ponderous and severely straight than light and flowing. The arrangement was infinitely more becoming than any other would have been to her complexion and what her admirers called the grandiose and massive, and her detractors the heavy and clumsy; mould of her nose and chin. She had been born and bred a city heiress, not immensely, but very respectably rich, just as she was very respectably connected in mercantile circles. She had been saved by the skin of her teeth from strong purse-pride by the pride having"], [28, "The American Cousins 16 been gratified on a higher variety of the same article \u2014 that is to say, the pride of birth, which had been a distinguishing feature in the otherwise easy-going character of the late Mr Sheldrake. Mrs Sheldrake was always spoken of as having been a model wife. She was not only a woman of good principles in the deep ruts of a somewhat stiff and stupid mind, she had grown to echo her husband's sentiments in nearly every particular, a process in which the sentiments, instead of growing and developing, had become set and petrified. Mr Sheldrake had not been without gratitude for his wife's deference and homage, for her never ceasing to remember that by making her and her fortune his choice, he had promoted her from the ranks of commerce to those of the country gentry belonging to a county which was eminently con servative (in spite of the fact that Coventry was within its bounds and Birmingham lay on its borders). He had left his widow with entire power over her ample property in the funds. This was a degree of freedom which her marriage settlement had not secured for her. It might have some show of justice, but it contained many elements of risk for the independence and liberty of action of the heir of Oakspur as well as of his sisters. This was particularly so when it was taken into considera tion that the jointure of the widow and the portions of the daughters were to be paid out of the Oakspur estate. Willie Sheldrake was thus to a great extent dependent upon his mother, since, without her and the allowance she chose to make to him, his impoverishment would reach a height which would render the breaking of the entail"], [29, "The American Cousins 17 and the selling of the property the best thing he could do, in a common-sense and business light. Oakspur had been long in the possession of the Sheldrakes, yet for the son of the family to seek to retain it without money to keep it up would be a losing game and a mere mockery. But Mrs Sheldrake had no intention of being anything else than a model widow and mother, as she had been a model wife. She took it for granted that her son would act in accordance with the creed of the Sheldrakes \u2014 maintain his proper position in the county, improve and enlarge the family acres with the fine old house attached to them, and would decline to barter his birthright and such other advantages as he might possess for anything short of a solid equivalent. Mrs Sheldrake had even a more than ordinary sense of obligation resting upon her shoulders with regard to doing her part in insuring her son's discharge of his duty in this respect. She was not a Sheldrake by birth, but she had never ceased to value the privilege conferred on her when she was made a Sheldrake by marriage. She continued to cherish an exaggerated, almost an extravagant \u2014 the only extravagant thing about the solemnly decorous matron \u2014 conception of the dignity and importance of the family. No effort would be wantino- on her part to vindicate her husband's trust in her, and to keep up the credit of the bouse. That it should at any time fail by her fault, or through a strain of deterioration introduced by her means into the veins of the distinguished Shel drake race, would be a heavy blow to her. It was on this very question of what Willie B"], [30, "18 The American Cousins Sheldrake ought to do with himself, and of what he ought not to do, if he would not bring about his ruin, that the mother and daughters were trying to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion on this June morning. A letter from Willie to his mother lay spread open on the little table at her elbow \u2014 a very unsatisfactory letter, of so startling and discomposing a nature, that the substantial, mature arm in the black sleeve actually quivered with indignation at the contact. \" It is too bad,\" said the poor lady, excitedly, pushing back her cap, and pressing her handker chief over her flushed face. \" It is intolerable that his father's son should propose to disgrace himself in this manner. I cannot consent to it ; I will not allow it on any consideration. What does the wretched boy mean by giving me this piece of information ? What do you say, girls ? \" Mrs Sheldrake was in the habit of appealing to her daughters \u2014 not because she had not a mind of her own, but because in addition to her natural affection for them she had a strong sense of their claim to be heard. Were they not born Sheldrakes as she was not? Had they not been reared in the dignified shades of Oakspur, while she had been educated in the comparatively vulgar publicity of an ordinary expensive upper-class boarding school. Mrs Sheldrake was modest notwithstanding her latent love of power : she was also wise in a dull, limited way. She recognised in the persons of her children the gain of belonging to the end of the century, and she was inclined to magnify the gain, and to view it as counterbalancing her superiority in years and experience."], [31, "The American Cousins 19 \" It is horrid behaviour of Will's,\" Mary Shel drake, the elder sister, answered readily to her mother's appeal. \" Of course, we can never have anything to do with a Coringham girl, a bicycle maker's daughter.\" Mary was a big, blooming girl, not without good looks of a robust type. She was robust in her broad-shouldered size, and robust in her high colour and abundance of light brown hair. She must have been very like what her mother had been at the same age. But neither her heavy good looks \u2014 such a3 they were \u2014 nor her resem blance to her mother afforded either mother or daughter much satisfaction. For all was in favour of Mary's being a \" true Benson,\" a pronounced representative of her mother's family, while Mrs Sheldrake and her daughter would have greatly preferred Mary to be a Sheldrake out and out. Mary's secret desire was that of Falstaff, \u2014 \" Oh ! that this too solid flesh would melt,\" and reduce her to the proper standard of tall, slender maidenhood. She would fain have had the ruddy colour in the round cheeks, which would \" hang \" a little as she grew older, pale into a more delicate complexion. It was hopeless to dream of its ever being washed out till it attained \" the creamy whiteness \" of some novelists' heroines. Mary answered exactly as her younger sister Elizabeth would have expected her to answer, in an echo of her mother's sentiments. For ponderous as Mary was in the material part of her, she was apt to be a mere reflection of her mother's opinions. Elizabeth Sheldrake had a romantically exalted estimation of the intangible no less than the tan-"], [32, "The American Cousins 20 gible rights and privileges of the Sheldrakes ; she was very proud and fond of Oakspur, with its mellow antiquity. She rejoiced in the fact that she bore the name of \"Elizabeth Sheldrake\" in collateral descent from a baby which had been christened for the Queen's Majesty, with the royal consent graciously vouchsafed, what time great Bess had made her famous sojurn at Kenilworth, when such of the Sheldrakes as were fit to appear had flocked to my Lord of Leicester's castle to pay homage to their sovereign, and to witness the pageants performed in her honour. The bearing of the name and surname was but a transitory honour, in all probability, for Elizabeth did not meditate vowing herself to perpetual spinsterhood, like her ancestress's illustrious godmother, in order to preserve the conjunction of the two names. It would be a pity, however, when the day came for the severing of the alliance, and, so long as it lasted, Elizabeth was tempted to plume herself upon it. She was decidedly a Sheldrake and not a Benson \u2014 a tall slip of a girl, with more nervous energy and elasticity in her taper little finger than Mary had in her whole big body. Elizabeth was dark, with a small, pointed face, and a tinge of sallow ness in her brunette complexion, in which, at the same time, the least stir or subsidence of feeling kept a vivid scarlet coming and going. Her eyes were the long, liquid grey eyes, with deep lashes which hide their secrets and render their very hue difficult to discern. Her soft lips were very sensi tive and variable in their curves, while they were capable of great determination. Her delicate chin was neither long nor short, and was slightly peaked."], [33, "The American Cousins 21 The shapely, dark head was set on a fine little neck rising above a finely moulded bust. Elizabeth Sheldrake was both outwardly and in wardly as aristocratic as she was womanly. But it softened the first attribute, and served to make it blend with the second, that their owner was also in a marked degree spirituelle by nature \u2014 an eager, imaginative girl. She desired with all her heart to master every interest of her time, to march in the van of the world's advance to its goal of truth and righteousness. But Elizabeth still clung to the conviction that the world should muster its myriads in feudal, and not in republican ranks. She had not borrowed a single one of the chaotic revolutionary and anarchical notions which beset her brother, as they beset periodically the hot headed, generous youth of every age and country. In Willie's case there was the presence of pas sionate personal interest to intensify his visionary time-immemorial creed. Still it was Elizabeth, the high-spirited, high bred Elizabeth, who replied to her mother, with a hesitating, despairing demur, \" Is it not too late, mother, as Willie says? May he not have gone too far to draw back in honour ? \" Willie Sheldrake's letter had run as follows : \u2014 \"Dear Mother, \u2014 The expression of your wishes, or rather of your entire disapproval of my inten tions, has reached me too late, even if I could, con sistently with my principles, have implicitly de ferred to your views in the most serious step of my life. I have already proposed to Miss Augusta Whitelaw, and she has done me the honour to"], [34, "The American Cousins 22 accept my proposal \u2014 an acceptance which I may say meets with the full approval of her parents. \u25a0Believe me, yours affectionately, \" W. F. Sheldrake. \" Daisymead, Coringham, \"lid June 18\u2014.\" It was an inconsistent letter, as most letters written under the influence of passion and of high flown sentiments are apt to be. If Willie Sheldrake defied his mother's verdict with regard to his choice of a wife, why in the name of logic should he bring forward the consent which his future father and mother-in-law had accorded to his suit as an argu ment in its favour likely to weigh with his mother ? The only effect which the reference produced was to cause his mother to say with a scornful snort, \" No doubt, Mr and Mrs Whitelaw approve. The reason why is not far to seek.\" Mary repeated the snort as far as her merely budding tendency to embonpoint and apoplexy enabled her to do. Elizabeth drew a quick sigh of impatience and vexation. The next in stant she muttered, \" Poor Willie,\" half under her breath. She turned her back on her mother and sister, and drummed mechanically with her fingers on the window-pane. She looked wistfully on the broad terrace, which was a feature of Oakspur, but she did not see the peacocks which strolled there in the morning sunshine; she saw with her mind's eye, first, a merry schoolboy recounting his school experiences, and then a thoughtful lad ex pounding his student's theories to his favourite"], [35, "The American Cousins 23 sister. The confidences had stopped short there. Willie Sheldrake, fond as he had been of Elizabeth, had not told her of his growing intimacy with the family of the bicycle maker in Coringham, and of the infatuation of his attachment to the elder daughter Augusta. Elizabeth only half resented the omission. \" How could Willie repeat to her what implied his social decline and the deteriora tion of his tastes, and how could he involve her in his quarrel with his mother ? Yet though he had told her nothing she could imagine that he must be very much in love with this impossible girl before he proposed to give up so much for her sake ; and for Willie to be deeply concerned about anything in which Elizabeth had neither part nor lot was a strange and unwelcome experience for her. In addition, there was the sense of the penalty which he must be paying, and must go on paying, for his folly. \" Poor Willie ! \" Mary was repeating indignantly, for she was still entirely under her mother's in fluence, \" I don't know how you can pity him, Elizabeth, when it is all his own doing. It is we who are to be pitied for having a creature thrust upon us as mamma's daughter and as our sister-in law whom we cannot acknowledge, whom nobody in the county will acknowledge. Poor Willie, indeed ! ' \" I don't think you ought to talk in that manner, Mary,\" objected Elizabeth, in hasty discomposure. She was endowed with a greater sense of justice than Mary ever showed, and at the present moment, trying as it was, Elizabeth was still striving to be fair. \" Of course it is Willie who is to blame, and"], [36, "The American Cousins 24 just because it is \u2014 because it is he who has proposed to marry Miss Whitelaw and not she who has offered to marry him, I don't see that we have a right to disparage her \u2014 or her family either, for that matter. Apart from their association with Willie, we know nothing against her or them.\" \" They are common, vulgar Coringham trades people,\" maintained Mary, doggedly ; \" such people as we never had to do with in our lives.\" \" They cannot help that,\" cried Elizabeth, sharply. \" They are not responsible for Willie's choosing a wife from their class and not from ours.\" She had a swift consciousness while she spoke, a conscious ness which made her catch her breath and falter a little \u2014 though not merely Mary, Mrs Sheldrake, too, appeared to have missed it \u2014 that after all Willie had only followed, in a more pronounced fashion, the example of his father, who had stepped some what from his sphere when he married a London merchant's daughter. \" I suppose,\" Elizabeth was going on slowly, \" Will is entitled to choose a beggar-maid for his partner if he likes. When one comes to think of it, it might have been better \u2014 at least, for the sound of the thing, if she had been a beggar-maid,\" the speaker speculated. \" Don't wrangle, girls,\" Mrs Sheldrake interposed, with an observation which both sisters regarded as unkind, for was not Mary standing up for her mother's opinions, and had not Elizabeth en deavoured to be candid with an aching heart ? \"And don't talk nonsense, Elizabeth,\" continued the matron, severely. She had not winced at the treatment of trade in her daughter's conversation she would have been the first to agree with them \u25a0"], [37, "The America7i Cousins 25 she had turned her back on trade both literally and figuratively when she was admitted into the ranks of squires and squiresses, but she could not endorse the preference given to beggary. \"Cer tainly the Whitelaws are nobodies. They would not be regarded as deserving of consideration even in the mercantile world,\" she added, after a second's hesitation. \"A local firm of bicycle makers \u2014 they may as well be simple ironmongers.\" \" That unfortunate accident of Willie's with his bicycle ! \" interjected Mary, with more resentment than regret as at a personal injury. \" It was a great misfortune to him and to us that he ever saw a bicycle.\" \" It would have been all the same if the accident had never happened,\" said Mrs Sheldrake in a kind of stony despair. \"To have met with a slight hurt and to receive a little ordinary kind ness from the people in the house to which he was taken is a totally inadequate excuse for forming an unsuitable connection. If Will could so easily lose sight of all that he was bound to remember, he would find no difficulty in discovering an apology for his forgetfulness. But if he is re solved to follow the unbecoming course he has thought fit to adopt, he need look for no counten ance or support from me. Therefore, it is well that these Whitelaws are well-to-do and not beggars according to Elizabeth's childish suggestion.\" The girls understood what their mother meant. She reserved to herself the right which her husband had given her of disposing as she pleased of her fortune. Oakspur had been heavily mort gaged in the time of the last two squires. Mrs"], [38, "The American Cousins 26 Sheldrake's private means \u2014 not settled on herself \u2014 had been willingly expended on paying the in terest on the different mortgages, negotations had been entered into for the clearing off of the mort gages, but some legal difficulties had presented themselves and the principal bonds were still held over the property. Without his mother's aid in discharging his yearly obligations the young squire would be poor indeed. With his share of the mother's fortune in prospect, he had nevertheless succeeded to less ready money than his father had fallen heir to. But in the midst of her wrath Mrs Sheldrake remembered what was due to her son's dignity and to the memory of his socially distinguished ances tors. \" No doubt,\" she remarked, with a certain lofty pomposity, \" your brother is not only his own master, he is the master of Oakspur. He may, if he will, turn us all out and put his low-bred wife in our place. \" But \" \u2014 she paused with gathering resentment, then went on the more emphatically for the pause, \" he will do so on his own responsi bility and at his own cost, not a farthing of mine will be at his disposal. I decline to have anything to do with my son's degradation.\" Dead silence followed. Even Mary's sluggish nature was impressed by the decision implied in her mother's speech. As for Elizabeth, she was too disturbed in mind to plead for her brother, while she was well assured the pleading would be useless. As a rule, Mrs Sheldrake was slow to take a resolu tion ; when she had taken it, it was a still harder matter for her to renounce it. It was she who broke the silence by a change of subject."], [39, "The American Cousins 27 \" Why,\" she exclaimed irritably \u2014 she was not wont to be irritable \u2014 \" there are these two children \" \u2014 referring to the deeply-affronted Dorothy and Eleanor \u2014 \" crossing before the window again. I am sure the grass is wet on that corner of the lawn under the lime trees, and Dorothy was complaining of a sore throat last night. Tap to them, Elizabeth, and call them in.\" A commission which was a sign that the family council was dismissed without having come to any clear conclusion with regard to the course of conduct to be followed as is apt to be the case with family councils. Only a deter mined principle of action was announced and a challenge thrown down to all who disputed it."], [40, "28 CHAPTER III THE HEROIC CONCLUSION ARRIVED AT BY ELIAS WHITELAW AND HIS WIFE IN THE INTEREST OF GUSSIE AND HER YOUNG MAN The town of Coringham was of quite as respect able antiquity as was the manor house of Oakspur. In fact, it had a certain superiority over the manor house and its race of Sheldrakes in its townsmen's claims to attention and respect \u2014 a superiority which Willie Sheldrake had readily seen and owned. The Sheldrakes had never done anything in particular to attract or deserve public notice, apart from the facts that they had been as a rule fairly good landlords, justices of the peace, and sheriffs of the county. Only once in the long list of them had they helped to entertain a popular sovereign, with the result that the head of the house for the time had risen to be her courtier and statesman, entitled to be addressed as her trusty and well-beloved cousin. But Coringham had figured in the national annals as one of the most ancient and turbulent of towns. It had a legend unsurpassed in romantic and poetic beauty all its own. It had figured later as the Ghent of English towns in trade struggles"], [41, "The American Cousins 29 and political events. Its burghers had been fiercely malcontent and seditious in contrast to the dainti ness and delicacy of its local manufacture, and they had demanded and received sharp discipline in their day. That stage was over. The towns men of all classes had quieted down and were now steadily prosperous, if less interesting in their later developement of peaceful inventive industry. When the production of ribands was overdone, the producers took up the lighter branches of work in iron, and revelled in velocipedes, bicycles, tri cycles, etc. In Coringham itself there were old churches, old houses given over to factory hands, old and new factories and foundries, and a quaint hospital square, a venerable refuge for the aged poor provided by the pious bounty of a medi\u00e6val founder. Outside the town was the usual girdle of villas and villakins, dapper in the trimness of their grounds, like the well-cared-for persons of their occupants, the modern representatives of the ancient turbulent burghers. This modern genera tion set up their green nests in the room of the smoke-blackened dwellings in the centre of the old factories, or over the ancestral shops. In one of the most commodious and ornamental of the villas, situated in the most extensive of the shrubberies and lawns, which were still comically circumscribed in contrast with a park like that of Oakspur, a stout, little, elderly man and a stout, little, elderly woman were taking an airing. He wore the straw hat of undress in his garden in stead of the chimney-pot hat of decorous dignity in his foundry. She had her lace cap and town"], [42, "The American Cousins 30 spun ribands, rather than the head which the cap was supposed to cover, protected from the June sun, long in setting, by an ample brown sunshade. The couple were perambulating paths all too narrow for them when they walked abreast. These paths afforded ground for the derisive term \" cats' walks \" applied to them by supercilious critics. The walks were robbed of their breadth in order to increase their length by ingenious windings, in the course of which they crossed, thus giving an excuse for more than one rustic bridge, over an obliging brook \u2014 apt to run dry in hot seasons \u2014 which had been coaxed out of its direct course in order to flow \u2014 where it did flow in the most constrained, artificial manner between the luxuriantly blossoming flower-beds and trim grassy alleys of Daisymead. The proprietor of Daisymead was able to boast that he could walk a quarter of a mile and back within his own little domain. It was not necessary to add that if he had a companion in his walk they had to march in single file, unless, indeed, the companion was to the manner born, like the stout, little, elderly woman who managed to trot and sidle half a foot behind, but still within earshot of the stout, little, elderly man. Nevertheless the conclusion would have been forced upon an impartial and candid minded observer that, given a private conversation of much interest and moment, the scene for it was not the grounds of Daisymead. True, a couple who were neither elderly nor stout found space enough there for their divagations, but they followed in spirit a very primitive and easily trodden path, the primrose path of dalliance ; and"], [43, "The American Cousins 31 the slight, active lad and slim, light-footed girl who traversed it under the common miracle in con nection with which two infatuated young way farers will carry their heads in the air, and not know the road they are walking upon, and yet will neither falter nor stumble in their course. The elders were all the more bound to see both for their juniors and for themselves, so it was well the circuitous \" walk \" suddenly terminated at the point reached in a capacious garden seat. It was in the shadow of one of the highest trees in the grounds, for the trees of strictly ornamental varieties had, for the most part, a youthful, beardless air, as if they were only in their twenties. This seat commanded no view in par- ticular, except that of the back of the villa, which, to be sure, was as highly decorated with mock little gables, pepper-box turrets and crow-stairs as was the front. If its red brick had but been less aggressively red and staring, the place might have been a miniature Oakspur \u2014 a pocket edition got up with a tantalising freshness and spruceness which made the whole thing an absurdity. But if there was any fault to be found with the view \u2014 not that it was the present gentleman and lady who found fault, they could look at nothing better \u2014 they quite feasted their eyes on their property, the gentleman in eager search of more improvements to make, the lady with a satisfied sense of com pleteness and perfection. And nobody could object to the roomy seat on which coat-tails and skirts could be spread out comfortably, while the wearers lounged at their ease in their respective corners. Here was an opportunity for intimate and pro-"], [44, "The American Cousins 32 tracted discussion which had better not be let slip. Only the birds in the copper beech overhead could catch a word which fell, and they were not likely to report what they heard outside a circle of feathered gossips. One thing, and but one, was wanted to render the suitability of the circum stances faultless, and that the thing the gentleman did not hesitate to suggest. \"Would you mind, Lyddy, if I whistled for Jenkins's boy to bring round the little table from the chalet, and put it before me ? It would be handy for a tray, which he could also bring if you could let him have your keys for Gussy to send out a glass of something while I'm filling my pipe. It don't seem natural, somehow, to be sitting in a garden in what's the substitute for a summer 'ouse or a harbour, and not have something to drink to the 'ealth of the company, including our noble selves. Besides, it was warm and worritin' in the foundry this afternoon. Hare's gone and broke the new machine of which I've just sold the model, and for which I've more orders than I can work out in time ; and Terry tells me the men are grumbling already at the long hours. Fools ! as if they couldn't lay it to 'eart that winter is coming, when the roads are mostly cleared of bicycles, and when, if it weren't for the perambulators and the sewing-machines, though these ain't our speci alities, and the 'Mericans do us brown in both, we might shut shop.\" \" Very provoking and unreasonable, my dear \" the recipient of these confidences answered, with a kind of brisk chirruping solace. She proceeded also to play her part in ordering the refreshment"], [45, "The American Cousins 33 which was desired \u2014 all the same she did mind granting the desire, though she was well aware that Elias Whitelaw was a temperate man whose temperance was to be trusted whether at home or abroad, else he would not have been in the position he occupied. He had raised himself from the ranks of \" machinists,\" while she had been the daughter of his first patron, a riband weaver on his own account in a modest way. She had never found cause to repent her choice, though Elias had long ago relinquished riband looms for bicycles, as a matter of trade. He had both ability and enter- prise, but they would not have sufficed to make him what he was \u2014 one of the leading machine makers in Coringham \u2014 had the qualities not been combined with the safe steadiness that rendered him also a good husband and father. What Mrs Elias Whitelaw did mind, was the lack of gentility involved in gin and water, or gin and \" Polly,\" or rum and lemon squash drunk to the accompani- ment of a pipe, not in a breakfast parlour, or a business room, but in \" the grounds \" of Daisymead. No doubt she had taken the precaution of turning her husband's steps to what might be called \" the back settlements,\" but even there he might be caught in his act of weak self-indulgence by any- body \u2014 literally anybody walking round the place. The young squire of Oakspur, who was rapidly descending from his Jupiter height of \" somebody \" into being \" nobody \" as one of the family, might, while he strolled about with Gussy, come across his future father-in-law and receive a shock from his improper proceeding. Mrs Worsley, who took her stand as the wife of C"], [46, "The American Cousins 34 \"a professional man,\" the senior member of the principal firm of solicitors in the town, while she was not above poking her nose where that con spicuous feature was not wanted, might detect the culprit without any trouble. Now, Mrs Worsley had been and was still in the habit of slyly twit ting the prosperous machine-maker's wife with slips she had made, perhaps a dozen years before, in the manners and customs of the select set in Cor ingham. This was delicately reminding her that she had not been born and bred to the honours she now enjoyed, to which she was fain to persuade herself \u2014 not without warrant \u2014 she did credit. Mrs Whitelaw was not exactly a vindictive woman, but she did thirst for a mild and becoming vengeance on Mrs Worsley and her allies. The instrument of this vengeance was not to be Elias Whitelaw, certainly ; but Elias, by his stupidity and dogged adherence to past sources of gratification, might go a long way in impairing and spoiling this vengeance. Mrs Whitelaw wished to show the great ladies of Coringham that she soared far above them in her aims for her two daughters, who were the ambitious little woman's sole concern and the pride of her heart since she had no son and no other child. She would prove to the very cream of the dlite of Coringham that they were, as she considered, far beneath the claims of Gussy and Sophy Whitelaw. It was a daring and dizzy dream, and it was un questionably interfered with by the reality of Elias Whitelaw sitting with his straw hat pushed far back on his head, and his stubbly hair pushed as far back from his heated forehead, drinking gin and water in his \" grounds \" at Daisymead."], [47, "The American Cousins 35 The entrancing dream had only latety dawned on Mrs Whitelaw's consciousness, but who could presume to say that it might not take solid shape and happen ? Elias was more than well-to-do, and his family lived in what Mrs Whitelaw reckoned to be good style. Gussy and Sophy had got every advantage in education which a devoted mother could procure for them, short of that \" higher education \" in classics and mathematics, barely breathed in wondering Coringham ears. Nobody could deny that Gussy and Sophy Whitelaw were \" genteel, nice-looking, prettily behaved girls,\" with all the ordinary accomplishments in music, drawing and modern languages\u2014 far beyond what their mother had reached, at their finger ends. Yet even their fond mother had the sanity to admit they were not world's wonders for beauty or marvels of genius. There was such a thing still as gratitude in the world, and events had arranged themselves most fortuitously \u2014 most providentially Mrs Whitelaw was tempted to think \u2014 for the future rise and pro gress of the Whitelaw family. If Mrs Whitelaw could live to see her Gussy transplanted into a county family, with Sophy in all probability to follow' suit, since she would have all the advantages of her sister's promotion, while Sophy was the smarter, the prettier and the brighter of the pair, then Mrs Whitelaw would die content. That is, if she were to witness the looks and speech of Mrs Worsley and her great friends the Barnes, the retired officer's supercilious womankind, on the doubly auspicious occasion. Whether Gussy and Sophy would survive the transportation which"], [48, "The American Cousins 36 their mother was meditating for them, whether she and they would be severed by a wide gulf, which non\u00a3 of them might surmount save at far apart and briefest intervals, Mrs Whitelaw, like many a worthy woman and adoring mother, did not pause to inquire. Mrs Whitelaw was unwilling to indulge her husband in refreshments of a kind, and taken at a time and place which were disparaging \u2014 not only to an eminent machine maker, the master of the amenities of Daisymead, but a thousand times more so to the fortunate man who was about to be allied through his thrice fortunate daughters to the magnates of the county. On the other hand, Mrs Whitelaw was only second in her devotion as a wife to her devotion as a mother. Further, she knew that her Elias, with all his virtues, was masterful and would have his way in most circumstances. Last and most forcible argu ment of all, how was she to approach her husband on a difficult subject and bring him round to her views if she began by thwarting the good man's natural appetites ? Therefore Jenkins the gardener's boy was sum moned, the table and the tray from the house were fetched \u2014 Mrs Whitelaw trusted devoutly no body would intrude on the scene. Mr Whitelaw was put in a genial humour, in which he was likely to receive the most startling communication quietly and to be brought to listen to reason on the knottiest point, as he sat sippino- the contents of his glass and puffing out his tobacco fumes, while placidly contemplating the narrow home prospect which now included Jenkins's boy"], [49, "The American Cousins 37 yoked into a garden roller and stolidly pounding the \"cats' walks.\" Mrs Whitelaw was called upon to make the first move and open the cam paign. This she did in a strategical fashion. \" I suppose,\" she began, with a little nod of her head and ostentatious sigh, \" I suppose we can't count on keeping our Gussy much longer with us, Elias, now that the young squire has come to the point and spoken out like a man \u2014 like a gentleman, I should say \u2014 and is so determined about it,\" and Mrs Whitelaw, a comely woman for her years, simpered sympathetically. Mr Whitelaw was not so sympathetic ; his brow clouded, he gave his pipe a vicious draw, and smoked on for a moment in silence. \" Determined, do you call him ? \" he said at last sharply. \" That ain't the right word for him, according to my notions \u2014 young squire though he be ? Wilful and keen and chokeful of fads, but as for the grit to stand up to them, and carry them out, I ain't so sure of that.\" \" Why, father,\" remonstrated Mrs Whitelaw, a little indignantly, ': hasn't he stood up to Gussy, and isn't he set on making her his wife and the lady of Oakspur, whatever his mother and the rest of his friends may say against it ? \" \"Ay, that's just it,\" said Whitelaw, with some thing like a groan, while he put down his glass on the table before him with a bang enough to have sent the glass to shivers, \" scorn to be cast on Gussy, the girl to be a bone of contention between a man and his family and class ; I could wish we had never seen his face, mother,\" he ended gloomily. \" Oh, hush, Elias, it is most ungrateful, down right wicked of you to say such a thing,\" cried Mrs"], [50, "38 The American Cousins Whitelaw in dismay and displeasure, \"and the young gentleman as fine a fellow as you could see \u2014 such a great match for Gussy, and the girl's heart in it.

How interested he was in the Coringham factories and foundries, the working hours and wages and everything, as if he had been born to it all ; and how affable he was and yet not affable \u2014 not as if he were condescending. Sophy, who is as sharp as a needle, always insisted on that, just as if he had been a son and brother of the house, or a son of one of the other families we know in Coringham \u2014 only he is deal humbler than Jack Worsley. He gives himself no airs and don't listen to you as if he were waiting to hear you make a mistake and to grin at you and swallow you up. What has turned you so against young Sheldrake ?

It is a mortal pity that Sheldrake ever crossed our path and took up with a girl of ours. I would have had another sort of man for her and her sister \u2014 a solid beggar, who knew all the hins and houts of trade, who spoke and acted from experience and minded his own business, though the business were not great to begin with.

Mrs Whitelaw pursued her advantage. \" There don't seem any occasion for you to come down on the young people,\" she said cuttingly ; \" they've enough to face as it is.

The words and action showed that though Mr Elias Whitelaw might be a clever machine maker, the cleverest in Coringham, a man of strong will and fiery temper when it was roused \u2014 witness his clean-shaven, square jaw, and the yellow light in his hazel eyes, which could kindle and darken under their slightly beetle brows \u2014 nevertheless his wife \u2014 smartly dressed, well pleased with herself \u2014 knew just how to manage him."], [56, "44 CHAPTER IV THE ARRIVAL OF STRANGE GUESTS AT OAKSPUR, WITH THEIR RECEPTION BY THE LADIES OF THE FAMILY Elizabeth Sheldrake was in her room as she had been for the greater part of the morning \u2014 she was apt to retire to her room where she was left a good deal to her own resources. Her mother and Mary were more congenial companions than she could be to either of them, and she had many occupations and interests which they found a difficulty in sharing. Elizabeth's room was not so much dainty as quaint. It was a low-ceilinged, wainscoted room in one of the older parts of the house. Her mother was put about by what she considered, with reason, the smell of old wood in Elizabeth's room, and when Elizabeth looked paler than usual attributed the paleness to this cause, and lectured her on her choice of a local habita tion, without seeking to restrain a Sheldrake in her selection of whatever apartment she preferred in the ancestral mansion. Mary regarded Elizabeth's room as \" abominably dark,\" and did not see how \" Maria,\" the maid, whose ministrations the two elder sisters shared between them, could do any satisfactory sewing"], [57, "The American Cousins 45 there, so in order that Maria's services might not be lost or wasted, Mary kept her largely in her room, modelling and re-modelling such departments of her wardrobe as came within the Abigail's pro vince. Besides, Mary, like her mother, did a great deal of parish and church work, only Mary did it by proxy, Maria being her proxy in the matter of hemming flannel petticoats and knitting children's stockings. The arrangement gratified Mary's bump of benevolence vicariously, while she enjoyed her influence with the vicar and curates and the general sense of importance possessed by a young Lady Bountiful. One of the chief inducements for Elizabeth's sacrifice of more daylight in her den than sufficed for her requirements was that the den had be- longed to an earlier \" Elizabeth Sheldrake,\" not, alas ! to the Elizabeth who had received her name straight from the Virgin Queen, but to an inter- mediate damsel who had flourished in the reign of one of the earlier George's. She had left her mark on a pane of glass in one of the small, high-pitched windows on which was cut with a diamond, in an antiquated Italian hand considerably stiffer than it was flowing, the words \" 0' loveliest Elizabeth Sheldrake.\" If the apostrophe was inserted by herself to be handed down to future generations, she must have been, as Mary said, disrespectfully, \" a conceited thing.\" But the last Elizabeth Shel- drake maintained the writing was done by a girl friend \u2014 some of whose love letters to the said Elizabeth were in her descendant's keeping, and that it was a monument to the ardour of female friendship \u2014 while it lasted. That between the"], [58, "The American Cousins 46 \" loveliest Elizabeth \" and her maiden admirer had not endured quite so long as the friendship between \"the ladies of Llangollen,\" which gives the lie to cynical men. The admirer had been swept away by matrimony, even while her Elizabeth had grown old and died in single blessedness in this room. But the episode had been sweet and tender in its day, and what was really of consequence, matri mony had not separated the girl friends in heart, any more than age had separated them. They had corresponded closely and faithfully through more than two decades, and had continued warmly attached to their last breath. It was the fact of the other Elizabeth's having grown old and died in that room which was one of the reasons why Mary Sheldrake declared it gave her the creeps to enter it after nightfall. For Elizabeth, with her queer fancies, would seek out and store up the relics of \" the poor old thing,\" who might have been her great-great-grandmother, but was only her great-great-grand-aunt. These relics were heterogeneous enough. They consisted of the satin piece with which their owner had finished her education, one of the slippers she had worn at her first ball, the pair of pockets in which she had balanced the treasures of her mature years, her nutmeg grater, her smelling salts, her \" drops,\" her tatting shuffle, her prayer book, and her pocket diary, the said stool which she had used in church, and a pair of lazy tongs \u2014 with which, after her eyes were dim and her joints set, she picked up any trifle she wanted from the opposite side of the room. The incongruity of the \" remains,\" did not rob them of a certain grotesque ghostliness where"], [59, "The American Cousins 47 Mary was concerned. Yet, in spite of the \" creeps,\" if Mary Sheldrake had remained long enough in her sister's company, her next move would have been to start an opposition room and an opposition ancestress, in the shape of her relics. Never would there have been a greater mistake, for Mary would have been totally out of place in such a room. It was not so with Elizabeth. She fitted into the haunts and traces of her predecessors, and looked as if she belonged to them, which she veritably did. The soul of the wives and daughters of the old Sheldrakes was in their latest descendant. She adopted their very occupations, succeeded in them, and liked them. She could do the daintily fine plain sewing which everybody nowadays said was a waste of time and trouble, yet when it was done by gentlewomen and their little needles, centuries before sewing machines existed \u2014 even in the chaotic brain of the most imaginative inventor \u2014 it looked like a reflection of the worker's dainty womanhood. Elizabeth recovered the well-nigh lost art of darning exquisite damask table linen by pattern. She rescued it from a stray darning sampler, and she was proud of her feat. She drew and puzzled out old tapestries, and embroidery pat terns, and copied afresh family manuscript music in its tatters. She only stopped short at distilling cosmetics and drugs. She would fain have tried her hand at brewing \" Mistress Jean's \" elder flower wine and have followed up the attempt by proceeding to concoct cowslip wine and balm wine ; but though there was still a housekeeper's room, with pantries in abundance at Oakspur in this"], [60, "The American Cousins 48 degenerate age, there was, alas ! no longer a \" still room.\" An additional argument against the revival was, that Elizabeth could not hope to be able to drink all her own decoctions, and she strongly suspected that anyone else who was wheedled or teased into tasting her wines and strong drinks might be excused for bringing a charge of malicious poisoning against her. Elizabeth had once thought of writing a history of Oakspur and the Sheldrakes, room by room, and generation by generation, as other old houses and families have been commemorated. But it seemed to her something of a desecration to open up the dwelling-place of her race, in all its storied corners, with all its cherished secrets and hushed-up scandals, for the inspection of a cool and careless public. However, she could at least preserve the material for those who woidd come after her at Oakspur, none of it should be lost by her negligence. She was so zealous in the work that she appropriated other people's tasks. It ought to have been the young squire's duty and privilege to \" sort \" the family papers, burrowing among them in dusty, mildewed retirement for long days ; but Elizabeth was welcome to undertake the labour and re sponsibility, so far as he or any other member of the family was concerned. Mrs Sheldrake would not interfere, because Elizabeth was a born Sheldrake, with a title to prowl among the old records \u2014 while the Sheldrake by marriage, with her additional years and experience, contented herself with looking upon each faded document at a respectful distance in a spirit of reverential"], [61, "The American Cousins 49 awe, amounting to wholesome fear lest it should come to grief by her doing. Willie Sheldrake, like Gallio, cared for none of these things, unless as they bore on primitive charters between the feudal owners of the manors and their \" villains,\" or vassals. Mary was im pressed by \" family papers \" as an indication of the standing of the family in the county, but shrugged her shoulders and threw up her hands at the idea of trying to decipher a single specimen. As for Dorothy and Eleanor, who were only trusted to stand with their hands behind their backs, and look on at the packets and piles, the girls confided to each other that such treasures were musty, discoloured trash fit for the dust-bin. Just Elizabeth, in whom the family believed profoundly where the old dignities of the house were concerned, whom they could trust implicitly without so much as telling either her or each other that they trusted her, was free to empty out, put back and generally ransack the contents of what was rather grandiloquently called \" the charter chest,\" seeing it contained few charters, and was merely a clumsy, strong box, stuffed with deeds, leases, contracts, packets of letters, diaries and house accounts. The place of this box was in a closet opening out of the business room, but Elizabeth, in her vested rights, was at liberty to make selections from what she considered her department of the contents \u2014 chiefly family letters \u2014 and to carry them to her room, to old Elizabeth Sheldrake's bureau, for more deliberate inspection and chronicling. D"], [62, "The American Cousins 50 This office young Elizabeth Sheldrake performed with much girlish seriousness and elaboration. She arranged her material after more than one approved method. She would begin in one way, and when she had nearly done what she had intended, it occurred to her, or she read some where that it would be better accomplished in another fashion, so she began all over again on a new plan. Happily life, so far as it had to do with Elizabeth, was long, her task was self-imposed, her labour a labour of love, and there was no press of being ready for publication at a given date with printers' devils looming in the near distance, to urge her on and spoil the delightful leisure liness of an occupation which had still sufficient earnestness and sobriety in it to rob it of trifling dilettantism and frivolity. Elizabeth was busily engaged at the bureau containing her last instalment of the Sheldrake papers. She was carefully studying and comparing dates and taking notes of such particulars as helped her to the time at which the letters were written, and the names of the writers, when dates and signatures were either wanting or illegible. She was carried away on the current of her work till her mind was more in the past than in the present, when her sister Eleanor rushed in, without the ceremony of knocking, and in great excitement announced that there were unexpected visitors in the library. Morning visitors had been comparatively rare at Oakspur since Willie was no longer at home, while the hours for making neighbourly calls had"], [63, "The American Cousins 51 waxed later and later according to the dictates of fashion, till nobody was expected to appear before the shadows were long on the grass, and labouring men were trudging home from their day's toil. \" There are two gentlemen downstairs, Elizabeth, two strange gentlemen. Burton did not know where to put them, since they did not look as if they had come on business, so he showed them into the library. They asked for Willie, who, of course, was not here, and then they inquired if mother .or any of the rest of the family were at home, and gave their cards. Oh, it is so odd, Elizabeth, \u2014 their name is Sheldrake, just like ours, spelt exactly the same, though they have come all the way from America, for I read the cards in the tray, ' George Sheldrake and Beville Sheldrake,' the White House \u2014 I forget the name of the State, but I know it is somewhere in America.\" \" There are Sheldrakes in America,\" said Eliza beth, half rousing herself and yet speaking ab stractedly as if she had not quite shaken off the effects of her work, \u2014 \" at least, there were not so very many years ago \u2014 not later than the eighteenth century. I had a letter in my hands this very morning privately written in this very room, by the Elizabeth Sheldrake who used to occupy it, I mean, in which she referred to these American Sheldrakes. She said her father had thought it singular that the family had quite lost sight of Humphrey Sheldrake and his descendants. She could remember having heard talk of the trouble he had got into in King James's time, but it was her father's impression that he had been hardly dealt with.\""], [64, "The American Cousins 52 \" You are the queerest girl, Elizabeth,\" exclaimed Eleanor in despair, dropping down in the centre of the floor, and instantly twisting herself up into one of those round knots which only the lithe limbs of very young girls can accomplish. \" If you sit up much longer in this room among these musty, fusty papers, you will grow into a regular mummy \u2014 do you hear ? When anybody speaks to you of a living man you are immediately busy with his great-great-grandfather. The eigh- teenth century indeed ! wdiy, even that is ages and ages ago. All the people who were alive then must be dead and gone, and mouldered into dust. I tell you, two living men, gentlemen, ' young gentlemen,' Burton called them, are in the library ; their names are George and Beville Sheldrake, and they come from America.\" \" George is a common enough name everywhere, and Beville is our old name \u2014 ours and the Granvilles',\" said Elizabeth, still speaking in a reflective tone, more or less remote from the present moment. \" I daresay they are impostors,\" said the disre spectful, matter-of-fact Eleanor, \" and have bor rowed the name from that horrid old tomb which stuffs up our pew in church.

At that moment there was a tap at the door, the"], [65, "The American Cousins 53 next instant Burton appeared and delivered a message with all the imperturbability of a well trained servant. \" Mrs Sheldrake has sent for you, Miss Elizabeth, you are wanted in the library.\" \" There !

Of course they will take you in since you are ready primed for it. Why could not mother have sent for Dorothy or me ? We have all our wits about us, and either of us have only to look the men in the face to tell whether they are burglars in disguise.\" \" Yes, you are the wise women,\" said Elizabeth ironically as she prepared to lock up the bureau with its invaluable contents and descend from her fastness. \" Why did not mother apply at once to you and Dorothy ? She might have known what Daniels and Solomons in petticoats she had at her command. \" Don't be nasty, Elizabeth,\" retorted Eleanor, \" when I came up expressly to tell you. I wish I had stayed with Dorothy. She has continued hanging about the hall, pottering among the ferns, to see the Americans with our name go out.

' You and Dorothy behave as if you were not"], [66, "The American Cousins 54 in a civilised country and house\u2014 big girls like you, as if we had a monopoly of our name, as if you had never set eyes on Americans \u2014 they might be Red Indians by the manner in which you are conducting yourselves.

George was trying to catch Beville's eye to telegraph to him in mingled fun and annoy ance : \u2014 \u25a0\" I told you so, but you would not be warned.

I know all about your ancestor who was brother to an ancestor of ours \u2014 I need not say you are welcome. Mother, Mary, we must make our American cousins welcome, especially as Willie is not here to do the honours.\" She looked again at Beville, who with George had risen on her entrance and was preparing to greet her with the same frank courtsey she was show ing. She hesitated for an instant, blushing a little in answer to the flush on his cheek. Then she said with unmistakable satisfaction and in terest, \" I think you are like Sir Beville Sheldrake who married Cordel Shenstone. It is curious how likenesses survive and come out again after many generations.

Come, Beville, we have reported ourselves and done all which our remote relationship warranted.\" \" Not at all, sir,\" said Mrs Sheldrake, hastily recovering herself, smitten with repentance for any lack of warmth in her reception of a branch of the Sheldrake family tree, whether its origin were American, Asiatic or African, if Elizabeth acknowledged the authenticity of the claim it was all right. \"Of course we are glad to see any member of the famity. Excuse me for not realising sooner who you might be. My daughter Elizabeth is the genealogist of the family, and she was able to recognise you at once. Yes, yes, I be lieve I see the likeness to old Sir Beville \u2014 now that it is pointed out to me,\" and she stared hard at George. \" Excuse me, madam, I have been told I have the misfortune to favour all my obscure ancestors on the other side of the house, this yere youngster is your born Sheldrake,\" glancing towards Beville, who looked daggers at his brother. \" I am sorry my son is not at home,\" went on Mrs Sheldrake, \" but if you will allow me and my daughters to represent him, we shall be greatly pleased.\" \" We can do the honours of Oakspur though we are women,\" said Mary in an echo of her mother, which was at the same time heavy and blunt, \" only gentlemen are rather at a loss when there is no other gentlemen to support them, but we cannot help that.\" No indeed, nobody could blame the innocent ladies for their incapacity to turn themselves"], [69, "The American Cousins 57 into gentlemen in order to oblige the far off kinsmen \u2014 who had been far off in two senses until the brothers undertook their present ex pedition \u2014 with their very existence undreamed of save by Elizabeth. The American Sheldrakes were willing to put up with the ladies in lieu of the absent squire. George was entertained by the humours of the visit and by the unconscious pomposity of Mrs Sheldrake and Mary. Beville was charmed with Elizabeth, and Elizabeth was much attracted by Belville \u2014 the man who was named for Queen Elizabeth and Essex's Sir Beville, the man who bore in warm flesh and blood an incontestable resemblance to the dim, dank, half-ghostly effigy of the most illustrious of the Sheldrakes. Eleanor might call it a horrid monument, stuffing up the family pew, but Elizabeth, who was made of different stuff, had looked on it with awe and admiration ever since she was a little churchgoer, in Mother Hubbard bonnet and cloak, of not more than six years of age. George was also taken with Elizabeth, but from the beginning he left her chiefly to his brother. The gentlemen stayed to lunch, and were shown over the old house with its picturesque corners and beautiful relics by no less a cicerone than Elizabeth, with her sisters clustering behind her. There could have been few guides like Elizabeth, so well in formed, so trustworthy, with such filial love and veneration for every object she pointed out.

There was the novel pleasure of seeing cousins from beyond the seas rising up as it were out of the \"round at their English cousins' feet. There was the earnest desire of Mrs Sheldrake to atone for her first stiffness, and to pay due respect to every human creature entitled to bear the name of Shel drake. There was a kind of longing common to the seniors of the Oakspur family, to find relief from the present discord and trouble in connection with the son and brother of the house, by flinging them selves headlong into a new and legitimate interest. The whole party advanced in their acquaintance as with strides made by seven-league boots \u2014 until the American Sheldrakes had consented on the press ing invitation of Mrs Sheldrake to come back in the evening and dine with the ladies. Nay, Beville, had proposed and his proposal had become almost a settled plan, that he and his brother should make their head-quarters at the classic little town they had entered for the first time this morning. They were to pursue their exploring of the old country and of the charmed county, which had seen the rise and growth of their forefathers, and of at least one man who was of infinitely more consequence to the world at large, under the friendly auspices of that branch of the house which had stayed persistently at home."], [71, "The American Cousins 59 George Sheldrake had lent himself so far to the altered arrangements with comical resignation. He could contain himself no longer, however. He broke out after Elizabeth had pointed with inno cent complacency to the peculiar and priceless features of the ancestral dwelling.

Why was he occupying lodgings in the town of Coringham under the shallow pretext of getting up a set of lectures to mechanics on a branch of practical science, in which he took an interest, that he had agreed to deliver in the flourishing mechanics' institute ? Why should a squire teach mechanics to mechanics, unless he had been be guiled from one hobby to another, in order to keep him off political economy on which the present Sheldrake of Oakspur was understood to hold very advanced and decidedly rabid views for a squire ? Why was there no movement made, or suggested for his recall, in order that he might be introduced to the two young men who claimed to be his transatlantic cousins.

The suspicion was simply revived at intervals, be tween themselves by Dorothy and Eleanor, because it was so deliciously sensational and blood curdling \u2014 what if the gentlemen's object was to rob the plate-chest ? What if the younger \u2014 the handsome fellow, who was the more plausible, kept Elizabeth talking over old stories, while the elder accomplished his fell purpose ? What if they were seeking to ferret out a family secret in the family papers ? That would account for their preference for Elizabeth's society, they would think they would worm out the truth by sounding her, and Elizabeth was so rash and wrong-headed, though she was so clever. What if, discovered in that nefarious scheme, they resorted to violence in order to silence their opponents and make their escape from justice ? What if the two strong men were to attempt to murder the whole family in their beds ? Burton, who had suffered from lumbago, Richards, who was consumptive, the coachman who was asthmatic, the gardener, who had a young family of his own to look after, the gardener's boy aud little Dick who cleaned the knives would have enough to do to defend a household of women.

George and Beville asked each other why did young Sheldrake's name occur so rarely in the conversation of his mother and sisters who might have been expected to quote him and his doings perpetually? Why did the younger girls look abashed, and yet as if they did not exactly know why, when any allusion to their brother slipped out in their chatter ? It was clear even to the least suspicious that something was wrong and that the house was divided against itself. \" But it is no business of ours, Bev,\" said George coolly. \" I guess every man may be left to hoe his own row.

Sakes alive ! man, we are not to soft sawder the women of the family and steal into their good graces, without so much as pre senting ourselves to the man.

That was a conclusion which involved too much deprivation to be contemplated for a moment with equanimity, far less approval. In fact it was to be avoided by every honourable means in Beville's power. Therefore the younger brother came to the con clusion that whatever family quarrel prevailed among the Oakspur Sheldrakes, Elizabeth \u2014 it was always Elizabeth who stood for the family in Beville's mind \u2014 would rather choose that her brother should get his due and should not receive any slight from the cousins who had got from his mother the entrde to his house of Oakspur, than that he should be studiously ignored. It was an awkward state of matters, so awk ward that the brothers went off together to inspect Coringham without feeling it necessary to tell what other object they had in view. \"Don't forget to visit the old hospital,\" said Elizabeth in reference to the sight-seeing, \"and mind you look out for the new shop, which they say is as good as a London shop,\" cried Dorothy and Eleanor vaguely, but never a word of the head of the Sheldrakes of Oakspur who had pitched his tent for the time amidst the smoke and dust of the manufacturing town. Indeed, Mrs Sheldrake drew herself up and looked stonier and more monu mental than ever, as if the very name of the place where her son had come to grief was an offence to her ears. Mary followed suit with unimpressive E"], [78, "The American Cousins 66 effect, she merely looked sulky where her mother was stiffly stately. If Elizabeth gave a quick sigh when the subject was dropped, the sigh was for herself and another and for the days which were gone, not for the benefit of her American cousins and not to be ex- plained to them. Arrived at Coringham, having satisfied them- selves of its antiquity, of the distinction of the most imposing churches in the place, and of the working of a riband manufactory and a bicycle foundry lest they should have to stand an examination on these points, George and Beville had recourse to the post-office as the readiest source for procuring their cousin's address. They did not fail to get it, and after they had, in accordance with the direc tions of the passers-by, traversed clusters of mean and grimy streets in the oldest part of the town, they stood at last in a low soot-incrusted entrance and looked up a dilapidated staircase full of fishy odours, before proceeding farther. \" Molasses ! \" exclaimed George. \" What does this mean ? This ain't like Oakspur. Is our re spected relative a Fenian in disguise or a Nihilist, or has he a pretty fancy for indulging in dynamite explosions which he can only prepare in the slums ? \" Beville shook his head, bent his straight brows in perplexity, and picked his way, having respect for his boots and his morning coat, which he was guarding from undesirable associations. For al though he was manly enough in his way, he was also something of an exquisite and a dandy in a simple severe style in his rough tweed, the last"], [79, "The American Cousins 67 specimen of Oxford shoes, the most quietly elegant of studs and dainty of cambric handkerchiefs, as his ancestor, Sir Beville, had been in velvet and brocade, gold chains and jewelled buttons. In reply to a knock at the first battered door the couple came to, an impatient voice, whose impatience had not robbed it of its modul ated cultured tones, called out \" Who's there ? Come in.\" \" Here's our madman,\" muttered George, and then advanced removing his straw hat and offering his card, \"I beg your pardon, Mr Sheldrake \u2014 I take it for granted you are Mr Sheldrake \u2014 my excuse for intruding on you is that we are Sheldrakes too, my brother and I, chips of the same old block I believe. We've come a long way, partly to look up the parent tree, and renew our connection with it \u2014 if the tree is agreeable, of course,\" he ended with a funny twist of his mouth. William Sheldrake had not been in communica tion with his mother and sisters since he had written the letter in which he had taken it upon him to announce that he had made a proposal to Miss Augusta Whitelaw, and that his proposal had been accepted by her and her friends. He was unacquainted wTith the advent of the American cousins. He did not know the family history with the fond familiarity of a deeply interested student of its crumbling and fading annals, as his sister Elizabeth knew it. But he had a dim recollection that there were Sheldrakes in America who had gone there rather in the wake of Raleigh than of the Pilgrim Fathers, and he acknowledged the obligation to receive them and look at their"], [80, "68 The American Cousins credentials, though he found it a detestable bore that they should trace him to his den. On second thoughts Willie Sheldrake was rather glad that he and his kinsmen should meet on what was ostensibly the same stand-point, for were they not professedly republican supporters of the equality of men? But he had, as he thought, strong reasons for the gravest doubt of the sin cerity of the profession on the part of them, and of their countrymen generally. \" Thanks, gentlemen, for introducing yourselves, and for making this appeal to our common interest in a stock which, I am afraid, would not only be enfeebled, but effete, were it not for the new sap poured into it from time to time,\" said the English Sheldrake with a commendable effort at corre sponding courtesy. \" Will you find a seat ? \" glanc ing round the bare but clean room which served both for a living and sleeping-room. \" There are two chairs at your service. No, I forgot, one has an untrustworthy leg. If one of you will be good enough to take my chair I shall have an apology for stretching my legs, which are stiff with sitting over my plans, while we discuss the degree of our relationship.\" The instinct of hospitality and the perfect simplicity and earnestness which were attributes of the man were expressed in the speech. The speaker was a handsome young fellow, with a strong likeness to his sister Elizabeth. But while Elizabeth was intellectual and sympathetic, entering with almost as keen a zest and as lively an enjoyment, or as passionate an indignation and as sorrowing a regret into the things of the past as"], [81, "The American Cousins 69 into those of the present. Still there was nothing unpractical about her, not even in her treatment of her department in the family. She would take no step for which she could not give a satisfactory explanation to herself and her neighbours, she would start no enterprise which she could not carry out in its integrity, establishing as she did so, a clear and convincing warrant for its existence. Willie's very physique, and it was highly characteristic, differed in several important respects from that of his sister at the point where their natures parted company. His forehead was higher and narrower, his eyes were more abstracted from the world around him in the light which some times glowed and sometimes wavered, but did not see what other men saw. His bodily presence was that of a young dreamer and enthusiast, who was not qualified at this date, to weigh the results of his dreams and shape them by the rules of logic. He might awake from them sooner or later, but whether dreaming in a fine frenzy, or startled out of his visions, he would be always as honest as the day, in his deepest delusion, as in his widest awakening and bitterest sense that he had deceived himself. He was sitting at a common rough desk writing, without his coat, otherwise he was dressed as he had been accustomed to dress. Why he should sit without his coat when the weather was less warm in July than it had been in June, he could not have told himself. It might be an instinctive adoption of the habits of the working men with whom he was identifying himself. He might sit without a coat just as he was accustoming himself to do"], [82, "jo The American Cousins without a smoking-cap and a dressing-gown. He might have a pressing desire to be in keeping with his surroundings. Willie Sheldrake was full of subtle, overpowering impulses like a woman. Neither was there any right reason, such as he could have plainly stated, for his occupying the quarters of an ordinary mechanic, instead of the best rooms in the best hotel in Coringham, suppos ing he chose to be on the spot in getting ready the lectures with which he was about to electrify his brother mechanics. He could not have told how he was to make this extreme proceeding agree with his intended marriage to Gussy Whitelaw, who had, of course, been brought up in the realisa tion of all the amenities of life, the portion of a rich foundry-man's daughter. This burying himself in the slums was a whim, a \" fad,\" a play at one aspect of universal brother hood, but he was not aware that he was playing any more than that he was dreaming. Certainly he was not aware that all the hardest experiences with which he sought to brace himself were secretly softened for him by the zealous care of his future mother-in-law. Not only did he spend his leisure with the Whitelaws, which was but natural under the circumstances, Mrs Whitelaw voluntarily undertook for him what his own mother failed to do. Mrs Whitelaw tried her best to protect \" the poor boy \" from the consequences of his odd notions which would all be set right when he was married to Gussy. In the meantime there was an old servant of the Whitelaws married and settled in the workmen's quarter of Coring ham, in which the young squire had chosen to take"], [83, "The American Cousins 71 up his abode ; and Mrs Whitelaw managed so that her former trusty domestic should, for a proper consideration, \"do\" for Miss Gussy 's eccentric young gentleman. She engaged to clean out his room, make his bed, cook his food and wash his clothes till he had finished his masquerading. All that he knew of the ministrations was that she was a neighbouring mechanic's wife, who for a gratuity (which Mrs Whitelaw privately supple mented) looked after his simple housekeeping. \" You see,\" said Willie Sheldrake in complete good fa'th to his visitors, \" I am like your great Thoreau experimenting in the wilds, but mine are not the vilds of nature but of civilisation, and my study is men, not beasts.\" And George answered him with perfect gravity, that he should think the present company's study was the mere interesting of the two. \" You Anerican republicans have changed on more questions than that of negro slavery,\" Willie told them. ' W7hat would Benjamin Franklin say to your colosal fortunes and your princely tastes and habits ? ' But he made the remark quite civilly in pure speculativeness. Beville answered yes, they had relinquished their quaker cut aid puritan austerity with equal philosophy and serenity. Willie excusec himself for not offering his cousins refreshment, since he suspected that his larder was in the same condition as Andrew Marvel's. It con tained only a nutton bone and some bottles of twopenny beer, hit if his visitors were hungry or thirsty \u2014 the sole excuse for mere feeding out of feeding hours, these provisions might suffice."], [84, "The American Cousins 72 To command the opportunity of following Andrew Marvel's example in this England of his and of their forefathers, was an alluring temptation, but the brothers resisted it. They were not in the condition which warranted their having recourse to food and drink, in more explicit terms, the pair had already lunched at the hotel to which they had gone on their arrival in the town. As it was now close on the hour for their train, the would-be host pulled on his coat, and strolled with his visitors to the station. On the way he seemed to forget what he had abjured in theory and practice, ard asked his cousins cordially enough \u2014 if they cared for shooting, and if they would not stay or for the first of September, or come back for it and try what the home covers produce, as a substitute for prairie hens and canvas back ducks. Then he recollected himself and said abruptly hi had given up shooting, but, of course, it was there for those who cared for it. He did not mention Oakspur otherwise, and said not a syllable wi;h regard to his mother and sisters. \" He would scoop the streets, so far as the hatters are concerned,\" remarked George in a, delightfully ambiguous American version of a man with a craze, after the brothers were seated tete-a-tete in their carriage, \" but I rather like the lunatic. Is it possible that his family have giver him up because he has started in life as a follower of Robert Owen and Simon ? The disease taken honestly is pretty sure to cure itself a long while before his head is grey. I thought better of their sense, and their family affection ? \" \" What are we to do about laving seen him ? \""], [85, "The American Cousins 73 Beville was already considering anxiously ; \" are we to mention the circumstance to the mother and sisters ? How will they take it ? \" \" That is no business of ours. Honesty is the best policy, young 'un,\" growled George pucker ing up his forehead. \" Leave it to me, and I'll bell the cat, or take the bull by the horns, which is the less invidious simile.\" Accordingly the next time the brothers dined at Oakspur, which they did frequently on Mrs Sheldrake's invitation, George, who had been asked to take the chair at the foot of the table which should have been filled by the head of the house if he had been at home, put down his glass of chablis and boldly addressed the heavy, stolid looking figure opposite him. \" We saw Mr Sheldrake, your son, in his rooms at Coringham when we were over yesterday. We had the pleasure of a chat with him, then and on our way back to the station.\" George very rarely sported his American lingo to Mrs Sheldrake. He ap proached her formally and ceremoniously, as she loved to be approached. There was a little trying pause after George's speech. The figure at the head of the table grew manifestly more and not less rigid in its attitude, but in the midst of the rigidity the high colour mounted higher, and there was the slightest flutter of the ample draperies. \" You are very\u2014 friendly, Mr Sheldrake, but my son prefers Coringham to Oakspur,\" she said stiffly, as if the words were enough ; then she thought better of it and took the opportunity of the servants' withdrawal to the other end of the room"], [86, "The American Cousins 74 to add in a lowered voice, \" as he has left us of his own free will, we have no resource save to accept his decision. We are \u2014 here at his pleasure, it is true, I need not hide that from you who are our kinsman, indeed I suppose you can guess it for yourselves. Only it might be inconvenient for him to turn us out, so we stay on, though I have told my lawyer that I am ready to quit at a day's notice.\" It was a long and exceedingly painful speech to come from Mrs Sheldrake, who was no talker at any time and hated to expose family troubles, while those of the Sheldrakes were specially sacred. There was a still more awkward pause after the speech than there had been before it. It was broken by Mary Sheldrake, who, with a bouncing toss of her head \u2014 which shook not her head alone, but her whole substantial frame, said, \" It is a sore subject, Mr Sheldrake, but we can have nothing more to do with Will, naturally. That is what mother means.\" Then Elizabeth's voice rose clear and bell-like with an unmistakable vibration of indignant pro test. \" How was my brother Willie looking, can you tell me ? \" she inquired with marked interest. \" He complained of bad headaches the last time he was at home. He did not say anything of them, did he ? \" No, Mr William Sheldrake had said nothing of suffering from headaches, and he did not look out of health to people who had not seen him before, so the sore subject dropped for the time. But the same evening, when Eizabeth was show-"], [87, "The American Cousins 75 ing Beville some tracings from monumental brasses which had existed in the little parish church of Oakspur, where other Sheldrakes had been laid to rest apart from Sir Beville and his dame in their place of honour in Stratford church, she took occasion to explain matters with jealous care. \"I do not wish you to think of my brother worse than he deserves, Mr Beville. He has disappointed us \u2014 my mother terribly.

Still we might have borne with his socialistic ideas and trusted that he would modify or outgrow them, but unfortunately he is going to put them into practice in a manner which will be irretrievable. He is about to be married \u2014 \" Elizabeth stopped with a gasp of vexation, her wounded pride and love choked her utterance. \"To a factory hand, to an uneducated working girl,\" Beville finished the sentence for her with respectful commiseration. \" No, no,\" cried Elizabeth, with a faint smile, followed by an angry little laugh, \" but I am not sure that it is not worse than that. Extremes meet, you know, and there is something romantic and picturesque in a Sarah Huggins who marries a Lord of Burleigh and dies of \" the burden of the honour.\" Willie is not going to do anything so strikingly unconventional and disinterested. He has promised to marry the daughter of a well-to-do"], [88, "The American Cousins 76 bicycle maker into whose company he happened to be thrown. He met with an accident, was taken to her father's house and the family were kind to him, the rest goes without saying.

We can have nothing in common with her, nothing to do with her ; she will have her own people and her own friends with whom she will be very popular, no doubt.\" Beville stared at Elizabeth and she stared at him, and then she went on hastily in a passionate summing up of the situation. \" It may seem nothing to you who cannot tell how we in England are divided by social barriers, and by the great gulfs made by rooted class prejudices.

Perhaps Elizabeth's brother would not marry Miss Whitelaw after all, and this was the signal for Elizabeth's turning upon the speaker in quick reproach. \" What \u2014 not after he has pro mised to marry her ? Ah, you do not know Willie ? \" Beville told George the origin of the family feud when the two went back to Stratford. George put the rockers of a rocking-chair which he had been so happy as to light upon in the private sitting-room of the hotel, in active motion, like that of a runaway horse which had been started into a canter, \" Good Lord, to kick up such a shindy about a one-horse affair like that, as if it had been the committal of all the deadly sins in the calendar !

A family in one of the neighbouring country houses had \" dear friends \" who had visited and tarried for a season in the United States. In these days of universal travel and annihilated distance, nobody stays at home, nobody is re strained either by the storms of the Atlantic, or the vastness of the Pacific till New York and Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, Sydney and Melbourne, Tahiti and Samoa are as much household words to us as were London and Chester, York, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dublin to our great-great-grand mothers. The special travellers referred to had come across the American Sheldrakes in their travels, and been hospitably entertained by them \u2014 now that the hosts were in the mother country, the guests anticipated their own cordial reception of the strangers, by writing to their sworn friends in the vicinity of Oakspur begging and beseeching them"], [92, "The American Cousins 80 to show all manner of courtesy and attention to the visitors. When Mrs Sheldrake heard of this farther and incontestable voucher for the young men, she was more than ever impressed. She felt as if she had been doubly remiss in her attention to their wants and that she had failed signally in her acknowledg ment of their claims. She insisted that they should quit their inn, come over and take up their quarters at the manor-house as members of the family which indeed they were, and tarry there for the shooting season if for no longer. The brothers were not unwilling to accept the invitation. They had been moving about from place to place before they came to Stratford, long enough to make a spell of rest not unacceptable. They remembered by hearsay a little of the old open-house hospitality of the Virginian country houses before the war. They had a wish to experience for themselves something of the life of an English country-house, the abode of their ancestors. It might have lost many a tradional practice, since the days of Washington Irving and Bracebridge Hall, and it had still a hoariness of age, a ripeness of custom and a mellowness of habit beyond what had been attained in the same line in the W7hite House in the New World. Beville was delighted to be as he felt at home at last, at table, in church, at family prayers, in the drawing-room with the ladies, in the gardens and greenhouses, in the stables and among the keepers as if he had never known any other existence he surrendering himself to all the rites and ceremonies"], [93, "The American Cousins 81 and interests as one to the manner born. He comported himself fittingly. He was as much in his element as Elizabeth was in hers in noting and chronicling every vestige of the past in the surviving names of many of the sur rounding localities, and in tracing the names to. their sources. There were \" The Standard Field,\" \" The Dead Man's Meadow,\" and \" The Horse Hollow,\" distinctive appellations dating back to incidents in the civil war of the first Charles's time, or even to the War of the Roses. There was a little modern ale-house \u2014 no doubt on the site of old quarters \u2014 for man and beast, since the staring sign bore the arms and motto of the Sheldrakes of Oakspur. These were the clenched hand with the drawn sword parallel with the open hand extended in amity, bordered by the words \" Strike in warre, clasp in peace.\" Beville had a facsimile of the sign still to be traced in a massive, much dinted seal, which Humphrey Sheldrake had carried with him to America. It was a sight to see Beville reading Spenser or Shakespeare, \" Kenilworth \" or \" Westward Ho,\" to Elizabeth ensconced in a window seat, or in a bower at the end of the Willow-tree Walk or on a settle in the porch, while she stitched at the faithful reproduction of the old Oakspur needle work from a ragged tapestry piece.

When the near neighbourhood was exhausted, then the American Sheldrakes from their head quarters at Oakspur undertook longer expeditions. In these the gentlemen had still their cousins' company when parties were made up, including the residents and the visitors in the other country houses around, or when Mrs Sheldrake bestirred herself to chaperon her house party. For though modern manners have relaxed much from their old-fashioned starchedness and primness, and have acquired an almost startling approximation to republican independence and freedom, the Miss Sheldrakes of Oakspur could not go scampering over the country by railway trains and in hired flies regulated to stop and bait at certain stages of the journey, like veritable American damsels.

It was all very well, or all very ill for Elizabeth to be occupied with old pictures, old costumes, old papers, old trash of every description. Elizabeth was in a sense by family election the historiographer of the Sheldrakes of Oakspur. But for a man \u2014 an American with only a collateral interest in the subject to give himself up to such trifling dilettantism was as bad as for him to be a connoisseur in old lace, a squire of old ladies.

Maidenly Oakspur, under the fresh stimulus, recovered its confidence and its share of social jubilation. Both George and Beville Sheldrake were strongly attracted to their cousin Elizabeth, and here a heresy against a popular creed must be frankly stated. Love, even in its first incipient stage, is generally treated as if it were an unconquerable force, beyond a man's power of mastery, a force as unrestrainable and untamable as the wind, or the waves, or the lightning, yet even the wind, the waves and the lightning have been in their turn bridled and rendered subservient to man's needs. Therefore there is surely a time in the history of the passion when a strong will and a resolute determination can check its growth and turn its course, before a tender liking or \" a sneaking kindness \" has grown into a desperate desire, while reason is still on her throne, and other obligations, other ties yet exer cise their lawful influence.

You be content with the portly old lady and the strapping Miss Mary for your share of the play.\" George Sheldrake drew a little apart from the family circle at Oakspur about this time. He professed to be tired of Beville and Elizabeth's ardent, unwearying researches after the ghosts of their ancestors lurking in the disused pigeon holes of desks and forgotten drawers, in frame less pictures by nameless artists, in threadbare cloaks and caps \u2014 the fur of which was moth eaten and the plumes shorn away \u2014 in shattered mugs and battered trenchers, the lumber of the garrets. George left the virtuosos to the delight of their hunt, he did not even intrude on them to rally Elizabeth. He only addicted himself moderately to the society of Mrs Sheldrake and Mary, which he told himself was heavy and in digestible fare unless taken sparingly and in snatches. He set up a character in those days for rather liking his own company in his rides and strolls over the commons and in the lanes, unless when he was getting information about birds and beasts from keepers and grooms. Though no sportsman, he was twice as zealous on the first week's shooting as Beville was. George would hum to himself one of the songs of the Civil War, about going where honour called him, then would abruptly change the strain to that of \"Bingo,\" or of \"The Meer schaum Pipe.\""], [100, "88 The American Cousins The phase of mental disturbance and irrita bility in George lasted so short a time, and was so little marked in its development that it escaped Beville's notice. Intimate with his brother and attached to him as Beville had always been, he was otherwise and more agree ably engaged on these summer and autumn days than in studying the moods and megrims of \" old George.\" Naturally, if the transition period was overlooked by those who knew him best, it was a sealed book to kindred only recently looked up, and to acquaintances of yesterday. Presently, virtue was its own reward. George recovered his equanimity. His manner might be a shade more sardonic, but his matter was none the worse. If anything he was more than ever benevolent and considerate under his bravado of in dependence and his affectation of Yankee swagger. A public opportunity occurred for the Oakspur Sheldrakes' display of their American cousins in the high value which the women of the family were inclined to set on them, nay, in the violent fancy conceived for them alike by matron and maid, from Mrs Sheldrake down to Dorothy and Eleanor. The last had been entirely propitiated by an extensive consignment of \" buttercups, marsh-mallows, peppermint creams and pop corn,\" ordered by George for their special benefit. The girls were now convinced, not only that the brothers were guiltless of burglarious intentions, but that they were heroes of the first water. Cousin Beville was for Elizabeth, the sharp young eyes quickly decided ; as for cousin George he was too good for Mary, he must fall to the"], [101, "The American Cousins 89 lot of either Dorothy or Eleanor \u2014 of which of the sisters, amidst a little rosy blushing and much giggling, they had not yet fixed. The elder Sheldrake womankind, while writhing under the desertion of Willie and of the sensation which the news of his approaching misalliance was sure to create in their circle, had rather shrunk from the usual round of stereotyped gaieties, each in its season; picnics, lunches at the covert side, country-house parties, the county ball, etc. Under ordinary circumstances Mrs Sheldrake and Mary had gone in for them steadily as a pendant to parish duties, but this year they had been in clined to withdraw a little from the field of con test. They had even entertained a half intention of not showing at the county ball, and by their non-appearance giving the signal for the onslaught of gossip. But everything was changed by the advent of the Americans. \" Of course our cousins must see the county ball, and must be seen there,\" said Mary in a tete-a-tete conversation with her mother; \"we have no reason to be ashamed of them,\" she con tinued in her blundering bow-wow style, \" they are sure to be noticed and approved of. They are more than presentable, they are quite fine-looking, strik ing young men. George is an original, and even Beville, though he is too much of a fop and a dilettante for my taste, is a regular Sheldrake, a good deal more so than some of us who have re mained on this side of the Atlantic. We may be thankful for such a creditable escort of our own people, and they will serve to divert the attention of the Warwickshire world from the absence of others."], [102, "The American Cousins 90 Mary stopped too late to prevent her mother wincing as at a succession of home thrusts. What enjoyment was there for poor Mrs Sheldrake in an attendance at the annual county gathering, to which she had been so proud and happy to go with her squire, for the first time, more than a quarter of a century ago \u2014 which she still ranked in her mind as the most dignified and select of functions, after she had been thus reminded that her son, her only son, his father's heir, had for saken his post ? Was not his place to be taken by strange kindred who were to cover his un warrantable retreat, and eclipse him in the good opinion of his neighbours ? Nevertheless, Mrs Sheldrake was ready to do her duty, and she was as ready as Mary to catch at any straw which would break the odium of this misfortune. It was Elizabeth who did not wish to go to the ball, and if Elizabeth had not gone its whole charm would have been lost to one of the guests ; though Mary took pains to explain to him that the Shel drakes when they were in the county, and when they were not in mourning, had always been prominent figures at the county balls as at the county elections. Oh, dear no, county balls were not very old institutions, not nearly so old as the reign of Elizabeth. There were banquets then, and if there was dancing it was generally in masques at the castles and country houses. Town halls in the market towns were not yet invented for county balls. Oh, yes, they were very con venient for the county meeting once a year or so. The floors were tolerable, the space was consider-"], [103, "The American Cousins 91 able, the supper and refreshment rooms were passable, and the decorations could be made effective by a little trouble on the part of the stewards. Even in the best ordered houses a great private ball was only justifiable on special occasions, there was so much inevitable confusion before and after the ball. No doubt that was the reason why there had been county balls and hunt balls, assize balls and yeomanry balls from the times of the earlier Georges, just as in Mary's great-grandmother's days there had been \"monthly assemblies,\" in the same social resorts of town halls and in the ballrooms of aristocratic old inns. Accordingly all the Sheldrakes, save one, were at the county ball; and Elizabeth, young and naturally gay in spite of her antiquarian pro clivities, with her spirits stimulated by the music, the lights, the company, in her white silk frock with the red roses she loved, examples of the rose which was known all over the county as \" the Oakspur rose \" on her shoulder, in her breast and in her hair, was one of the belles of the ball, as she had been every year since she came out. It was pretty plain that one of the American cousins thought her the belle of belles. Then a hue and cry went through the room and was not drowned by the strains of the band and the patter of the dancers' feet. Here was a match ready made. There had been a whisper afloat ere this circulating at covert sides, in smoking-rooms, at afternoon tea-tables of the true state of affairs with regard to Oakspur : Why the estate belonged virtually to Mrs Sheldrake and"], [104, "The American Cousins 92 not to her son, for whether she bought up the mortgages or left the interest on them unpaid the hare-brained renegade would be stranded. There had been a speculation founded on a notion of the unbending nature of the woman and of her devo tion to the honour of the family, whether if her son offended her beyond forgiveness, she might not disinherit him by buying the estate in and him out, subject, of course, to the breaking of the entail, and by making an elder son of her daughter Mary. Here was a splendid opportunity found for her. The Sheldrake name and the Sheldrake face were here with only the faintest trace of an American accent and of the pronounced Yankeeism of that old transatlantic fish, his brother. It did not matter much whether it was Elizabeth or Mary who was made the son and heir, since the mother could still afford to give an equivalent dowry to the elder daughter, and it was Elizabeth who had always been taken up with the family traditions and the old house. In the meantime Elizabeth had suddenly quitted the circle of dancers and sat down in the middle of a waltz with her cousin Beville. It was not that her head swam or her breath failed, it was not because she had overheard a single hum of the buzz of gossip, or that the idea had been suddenly presented to her of filling her brother's shoes. It was simply that various recollections had come back to haunt and torment her. Willie had been with her when she made her debut at one of these county balls and had shared all her light hearted pleasure and success. They had danced together in a delightful waltz, which the spectators"], [105, "The American Cousins 93 had pronounced interminable, which Elizabeth at least had not forgotten. Willie had been proud of his favourite sister in those days. Now this was the night of his first lecture to the mechanics of Coringham, and however great the number of mechanics and masters who might be there to profit by it, not one of his family, not his sister Elizabeth, was there to support him. Did he miss them ? Did he miss her\u2014 his former companion and confidante \u2014 or were they as much out of his mind as out of his sight among the crowd of his new associates ? Ah ! if Willie had but been true to the obligations of his class and race, how different it would have been ; he would have been welcome to lecture to mechanics \u2014 nay, how proud Elizabeth would have been of his oratorical gifts. For Willie could speak like a full-blown orator when the fit was upon him. Other people might have questioned and criticised, but she, who best knew his sincerity, would have been deeply impressed by his lofty magnanimous theories, so long as they were only theories well balanced by his hereditary instincts. How willingly she would have owned the mental and moral superiority of a lecture to a ball, even though her ears tingled and her feet prepared to dance in sympathy with the ball-goers. The American cousins too would have been there to hear Willie air his views for the good of mankind, and no doubt they would have echoed his senti- ments in a grand general democratic republican way. How could Willie go and spoil it all by his wrong-headed determination to put his possible theories into impossible practice ? How could he propose to take a step which was as indefensible"], [106, "The American Cousins 94 as it was irreversible ? How could he think of turning his back on his friends and giving up his family in order to marry a Miss Gussy Whitelaw, daughter of Mr Elias W7hitelaw, the bicycle maker of the bicycle foundry and of Daisymead Villa, Coringham % Elizabeth could have cried with vexation in the face of the \" gentle \" enthusiast Beville Shel drake and of the assembly which was predicting high fortunes for the pair. But since it was a case of noblesse oblige she had to choke back the tears which had sprung to her eyes, and say her momentary giddiness had passed off. She had to consent to take the arm of her deeply concerned cavalier and pass with him into the fresher air of the refreshment-room, there to be beset by other sources of mortification and a brand new aspect of temptation. That was a trying ball for the Sheldrakes. They were constantly assailed, whether inadvertently or advisedly, by allusions and suggestions which tried even Mary's stout stolid spirit. \" Oh, you dear, dear Sheldrakes,\" cried Lady Thorndale of Gray Court, catching a couple of hands at random and squeezing them effusively, \" I am so glad to see you here to-night after all, and my friend Willie too, in his proper place,\" glancing with her short-sighted eyes at Beville, who happened at that moment to be attending Mrs Sheldrake to a dowager's chair ; \" what lies people do tell, to be sure.\" Lady Thorndale, as the countess of the Earl of Thorndale, was not only the grandest dame in the company, she was full of the milk of human"], [107, "The American Cousins 95 kindness and would not have hurt a fly. But what did her good will signify when she thus blundered and trampled unmercifully on the finest feelings of her hearers ? As for the Kershaws of Burgoyne, they had always assumed an intimacy with the family at Oakspur, and with Wrillie Sheldrake in particular, in a manner which had nettled Elizabeth because it was not warranted by facts. She had not liked the Kershaws, who had settled in the county within the last generation. They were monied people, and they were the smartest of the smart, without any antecedents to speak of, as far as the world knew, but they commanded a respectable visiting list. Elizabeth thought the Kershaws pushing and scheming and she decidedly disapproved of the second daughter, Mona Kershaw, who had set her cap at Willie in the most barefaced fashion. Eliza beth, whose character was transparency itself, had shown her disapproval. Mona Kershaw's retalia tion was to take up a tone of confidential con dolence, and at the same time to assume the lackadaisical, long-suffering air of a person who in the sea-blue costume and the pearls, which her fair complexion justified, has been deeply injured, but is too noble to withhold forgiveness from the sinner. All the while Elizabeth knew that Mona was quite capable of dropping the pretence and maliciously laughing with her cronies over the Sheldrakes' discomfiture. \" Oh ! my poor dear Elizabeth,\" whispered Mona, \" it is so brave of you all to come to the ball and keep up appearances with your new-found cousins to back you. Are they as delightfully piquant"], [108, "The American Cousins 96 as some Americans are ? I have heard one of them is a perfect Artemus Ward, or Mark Twain was it? Your mother too, here ; dear ! dear ! what an effort she must have made ! These are not like old times, but we cannot wish any harm to come to whoever has changed them, can we ? \" Elizabeth could have beaten the speaker for the vaguely pensive question. At the same time the sharpest pang of all shot through her heart with the momentary regret that she had stood between Mona Kershaw and the object of her ambition. Who knew that if left to themselves the girl might not have got round Willie, with his head in the clouds, and flattered him into acquiescence in her wishes. At least Mona and her family had pro pelled or wormed themselves \u2014 it was partly by both processes \u2014 into the county set, were accepted and received everywhere, and had the shibboleths of society at their finger ends. If Willie was to throw himself away he had far better have done it with Mona Kershaw. The ordeal which left the most abiding conse quences behind it, was yet to be encountered how ever. Towards the close of the ball a learned genealogical squire, Mr Seale of Pollard, who had chanced to grace the festivity, bustled up and begged to be introduced to the American Shel- \u00a9& drakes. \" Bless my soul, have they come back at last \u2014 old Humphrey Sheldrake's descendants in the sixth or seventh generation, I ain't clear which, and if I ain't I crave leave to ask who is ?

In one sense the young Yankee, if he will forgive me for calling him so, has the better right to the ancestral face \u2014 that is the most clearly defined and characteristic face to be found among the Sheldrake faces, for Humphrey, from whom he and his brother are descended, was the elder son of Sir Beville and his wife Cordel, while Henry, the younger brother, was the fore father of our friends at Oakspur here,\" looking round on the attentive audience he had gathered to listen to his tale. \" But it is too late to speak of disturbing the succession,\" he resumed cheer fully, \" we need say nothing of that, tut, there is not a shred of legal \u2014 whatever there may be of moral title, the suppression of the outlawed rebel in the line of succession was enough iu itself, even if the story had not been centuries old.\" Was it too late ? And had not Elizabeth known the whole story long before the arrival of her cousins from what had been \" the New World \" to Humphrey Sheldrake ? Old Squire Horace Seale might crow as loudly as he liked, she was as familiar with the records of her own house as he could be with the history of every family of gentle descent in the shire.

But what of the right morally ? Could it lapse by dint of a forfeiture which might have been reversed in any generation, or simply in the course of time ? Was the elder Beville Sheldrake's face sent over among them from the tobacco and cotton plantations and the mango breaks of Virginia, brought back out of the shadowy yet glorious past, when the virgin Queen was making her royal progresses, when recruits from every honourable house were whipping and spurring to Plymouth to join Sir Francis Drake in fighting the Armada, when immortal Will was writing his plays in this same leafy Warwickshire ? was it, in order to re mind the living of to-day, in the Victorian age, of the priority of the claim morally, of the set-at nought Humphrey and his generous descendants who did not breathe a word of the birth-right in abeyance to what Elizabeth held so dear\u2014 the fruitful acres and the storied manor-house of Oak spur ? Was Willie Sheldrake's erratic career, his strange divagations, his renunciation of his class and his class's creed, only another proof that the English Sheldrakes' day was over, and their rule ended at Oakspur ?"], [111, "99 CHAPTER VII MRS WHITELAW'S COMMUNICATION TO HER DAUGHTERS It is a marvel and an exciting diversion to trace the all but invisible channels by which news, fashions, augurs, forebodings, travel with the speed of lightning from place to place and from class to class, through town, district and country. The burgher town of Coringham was not in touch \u00a9 \u00a9 with what called itself emphatically \" the county \" in Warwickshire. Yet the Justice Shallows, with their wives and daughters, were closely watched, even when they were not slavishly followed, in every step of their domestic histories, in all their ways and doings by the upper ten of the trading town. They in their turn were zealously copied by the smaller shop-keepers, etc. The county ball was a topic of much interest to those who did not even hope ever to pass beyond its conventional barriers as strongly defined, as immovable and as insurmountable to local aspir ants, whatever they might be to strange Cr\u0153suses, as though the barriers had been of iron or granite. The ladies who were the beauties of the ball were eagerly inquired into and discussed by those who"], [112, "The American Cousins 100 never saw them at close quarters, the tattle of the provincial assembly \u2014 who were the most notable of the visitors staying in the neighbouring country houses and gracing the ball \u2014 the matches which were being made up \u2014 the rivalries and the quarrels which were brewing \u2014 the alliances, offensive and defensive, in the act of being cemented, filtered mysteriously through the narrowest outlets, till in the course of a couple of days all the details were the common property of the whole community, especially of the women. Thus it came about that, on the second day after the county ball at which the American Sheldrakes had made their appearance, not only the fact of their advent on the scene, but all the rumours and speculations occasioned by Mrs Sheldrake's un qualified acceptance of her late husband's kinsmen and her public display of them, and of the regard in which she held them, were in active circulation in Coringham. No doubt the circulation was all the more active because the young squire of Oakspur, the only person whom the gossip did not reach for some time, was resident in an odd guise in the town, and was about to ally himself with it by an un suitable marriage with Gussy Whitelaw. It was a marriage which the towns-people of Coringham for their part condemned quite as strongly as the rural gentry protested against it. It was all owing to the senseless, unbounded family ambition of Mrs Whitelaw. She and she alone was at the bottom of it. The opportunity had come to her in the bicycle accident which had thrown young Sheldrake on the WTiitelaws' hands for a short"], [113, "The American Cousins 101 time. Since then Mrs Whitelaw had gone on dragging, not only the unfortunate, feather-headed young man, but her husband Elias, who ought to have had more sense, and her two daughters \u2014 Gussy, in whose mouth it was supposed butter would not melt, yet she had proposed to feather her nest in this unscrupulous style. A tolerably empty and comfortless nest it would be if Mrs Sheldrake of Oakspur used the power which was in her hands in the manner indicated. Serve the Whitelaws right ! they ought to have kept within their own class, especially as Elias Whitelaw had risen from the ranks, and his wife's connections were not anything to boast of. And there was Sophy Whitelaw, a young vixen, with her sharp tongue and her assumption of scorn for worldly advantages. She was ready enough to swallow her sister's marriage with a squire \u2014 very likely to be landless, as soon as it came in Miss Gussy's way. No doubt Miss Sophy laboured under the mistaken impression that her pungent speeches and rude manners might secure her another squire, or, if not a squire, the rector of the parish, or the family doctor, invited to dine with the squire of a Sunday. Mrs Whitelaw and her daughters were in full possession of all that was known in Coringham of the transactions, and inferences drawn from the transactions, at the county ball, as soon as any other family in the town had become acquainted with them. They were sitting in conclave on the subject, just as Mrs Sheldrake, Mary and Elizabeth, had met to discuss Willie's momentous letter in the morning-room at Oakspur."], [114, "The American Cousins 102 There did not happen to be a morning-room at Daisymead. There was a breakfast-room which \u2014 tell it not in Gath \u2014 was in the area, and was strictly limited to its raison d'etre. Mrs Whitelaw in the exciting nature of the tidings which had reached her in the course of a round of calls \u2014 the ladies of Coringham were addicted to calls \u2014 had not been \u00a9 able to wait till she had taken off her bonnet and repaired to the drawing-room. She had summoned Gussy and Sophy, whom she saw in the garden, to the laundry \u2014 an out-building on the ground-floor, at that hour untenanted. After carefully closing the door, she rushed into the discussion of the alarm ing reports, and this in spite of the awkward detail that the laundry was not better supplied with chairs than was Willie's Sheldrake's mechanic's lodging. Sophy, who took in general features at a glance, had to hand the only available chair to her mother, while she waved Gussy in her dainty cambric frock to the ironing-table. Sophy herself would have preferred an inverted tub for her throne, but the tubs were in the shed outside, so that she had to content herself with mounting to the elevation of the patent mangle \u2014 the upper portion of which was in danger of rolling off with her if she touched the handle. But first she had the consideration to see that Gussy was in the shelter of a clothes screen. If there was to be any agitating discussion, doubt less relating to Gussy and her lover, her blushes ought to be hidden even from the partial exposure of the laundry. \" Girls, I could not wait till I got upstairs, be sides father might be coming in about this hour. I am afraid it is all up with young Sheldrake, you"], [115, "The American Cousins 103 must not take on, Gussy, it is not his doing, poor lad, it is his cruel, wicked, unnatural mother that is to blame.

Poor fellow, he is as much her bond slave as if he were in the clutches of the Jews, and she ain't going to spare him. She has got hold of some American Sheldrakes, cousins of the family. She had them with her, showing them off at the ball, two nights ago. She's going to marry the one to Miss Sheldrake and the other to Miss Elizabeth\" \u2014 (Mrs Whitelaw only repeated the story as it had been told to her, which is an additional proof that a tale loses nothing in the telling), \u2014 \" buying her own boy out and leaving him in the cold.\" \" Oh, poor Willie,\" cried Gussy piteously. \" Only to think what I have cost him ! \" \" Poor Gussy, rather,\" protested young Sophy, indignantly, giving the mangle such an impetus by a hasty movement that she did roll away into the near distance. Her little journey did not stop the current of her ideas, however, for she went on in an unbroken stream. \" Only to think what Mr William Sheldrake will cost you ? \" The two sisters of nineteen and eighteen were as different as Mary and Elizabeth Sheldrake were \u2014 as different as sisters could be. They had their old fashioned fine names because of a fancy of their mother when the elder of the two was born."], [116, "The American Cousins 104 Mrs Whitelaw was just emerging in the early days of Elias's prosperity from the first slough of her humbler position in Coringham. She was de- termined to rise in the world for the sake of her infant girl, and to give her a name which would be in keeping with her future gentility. High life below stairs in the matter of fine names had not then swamped Coringham to any great extent. Besides Mrs Whitelaw had too much to do to be a novel-reader in those days, and she did not take in the \"London Journal\" or similar literary pro- ductions. She had not a great repertory of elegant names to choose from while Elias left her to her own choice. \" Ad it been a boy, the matter would have been different,\" he asserted ; \"but in the case of a girl, mother might take her own way.\" In her youth Mi's Whitelaw had known and looked up to a pair of old ladies who had fallen from their high estate, but, like the immortal Mrs Kenwigs, had always been careful to preserve every trace of their original superior position. They had been in the habit of boasting of this among other distinctions, that they had got their Christian names of \" Augusta \" and \" Sophia \" from a couple of still older ladies who had been christened in their day by the mouth-filling names of two royal princesses. To add still greater sonorous dignity to her se- lection, Mrs Whitelaw tacked on \" Amelia \" to \" Augusta,\" and when Sophy appeared on the scene and was to be no less favoured than her elder sister, she received the name of \" Sophia Matilda.\" But \" Augusta Amelia\" and \" Sophia Matilda\" were far too cumbrous and grand appellations for"], [117, "The American Cousins 105 every-day use. Besides Mrs Whitelaw was grow ing older and wiser, was better read and better bred, and had become more than doubtful of the oppressive stateliness of her daughters' baptismal titles. Thus \" Augusta Amelia \" and \" Sophia Matilda \" gradual^ found their level by degener ating in the simplest, most natural process into \" Gussy \" and \" Sophy.\" On the score of education the sisters had fared fairly well. Standards have so risen, let us be thankful that the old, outrageously foolish slip-shod boarding - schools have disappeared. Middle-class girls have as good, sometimes better chances in education \u2014 that is, in the education of books, as their sisters several stages higher in social rank. Gussy and Sophy Whitelaw knew as much and rather more from direct teaching than Mary and Elizabeth Sheldrake knew. It was in the knowledge of men, not of books, that the two first were necessarily deficient, and they had not travelled beyond a trip to Paris and a sail up the Rhine to which Elias had treated his family. They had been confined to the provincial society of Coringham. They knew little or nothing of horse flesh or dog flesh, and not much more of riding and driving. They had never hunted or shot or fished; they had not been present on a single race-course, or even at a great boat-race, so that they had never betted so much as a pair of gloves, either on horses or boats. They had not witnessed a polo match. They had not, of course, been presented to Her Most Gracious Majesty, or realised the bewildering delights and fatigues of a London season."], [118, "106 The American Cousins Gussy was the less pretty of the two where both girls were nice looking, though neither pos sessed the height which is now in request for a fashionable beauty. Their father and mother were little and stout, and both Gussy and Sophy were little, though hardly plump as yet. They were neither blondes nor brunettes ; they presented the juste milieu of auburn hair, which had more of red gold in it on the head of Sophy than on that of Gussy, and eyes ranging from the violet blue of Sophy's to the summer sky blue of Gussy's. With so much in common there was as marked a difference in the sisters' looks as there was in their characters, which had the same foundation of honest goodness. Gussy's little, round nose and soft, slightly open mouth had no place in Grecian, Roman or aquiline types of beauty, and her complexion, though fair, was sufficiently pale to throw up the light brown freckles which are apt to accompany such a complexion. Sophy's small, fine, very retrousse' nose was really an excellent specimen of its kind. It was not only more piquant, it belonged to an order of beauty \u2014 not the highest, but an order, never theless, as Sophy was aware. Her mouth was a little large, but it was well formed, well defined, and full of cheerful confidence and decision. Her complexion, at its best, had the fresh, bright, apple red tints which are at once more brilliant, more shifting with the charm of variety, and in more agreeable contrast to the white of the forehead and throat, than the rose - pink which has a tendency to break its bounds and spread into"], [119, "The A4merican Cousins 107 the adjacent territories of the chin, the ears, and \u2014 crowning misfortune, the nose. But, though Sophy was unquestionably the prettiest of the sisters, Gussy possessed the in tangible, irresistible attraction which in some women is much more potent than any amount os' the beaute de diable on the part of their sisters. There was in it a restful, trust-inspiring element of patience, kindliness and unselfishness together with an infinite capacity for tenderness. She was the whole family's resource in any trouble, great or small. She was helpful to both father and mother in a manner they hardly suspected, since they were under the impression that, with flourish ing fortunes and a staff of servants, they did not need help. She was Sophy's darling while she was at the same time her butt. She was also the buffer between Sophy and the world, breaking all the blows which it was pretty certain to deal her sister, receiving, in the first place, and moderat ing, in her role of medium, a return for the buffets which Sophy dealt the world without scruple. Gussy was the arbiter in every trifling misunder standing between the Whitelaws and any member of their circle, and in every tug-of-war with the maidservants, who were sometimes too many for Mrs Whitelaw. She was not to the manner born, of ruling such a household as that of Daisymead, and was, in proportion, liable to be a little unreasonable and capricious in her domestic dealings. In fact, Gussy was, after a fashion, the stay of the establishment, while to the public she was only"], [120, "108 The American Cousins a quiet somewhat shy and reserved girl, thought ful for her years, and fond of the higher order of reading. Sophy, on the contrary, did not care to sit still and think, chiefly because she had brains and could not prevent them from thinking. She did not read the thoughtful books Gussy read, she was fond of picking up \" useful information \" and rather vain in displaying it, and she enjoyed books which amused her. She liked the stir and amusement involved in walking, dancing, tennis-playing in summer, and skating in winter, in going little trips on the railway, and in visiting, even though the visits were only attractive in the light of a change from the home routine. Indeed, she liked society so well, in spite of the \" rubs \" which she and it exchanged liberally, as a result of her quick temper and quick tongue, that she was tempted to think any society better than none. Willie Sheldrake had not been slow to discover Gussy's merits and to fall a victim to them, and Gussy was the very mistress for him, sympathetic, imaginative, loving and confiding. She lent a patient ear to all his wild theories and extravagant projects, found a soaring virtue in them even when her better balanced judgment could not endorse them, loved him for entertaining them, and was ready to be a martyr to them for his sake. Of a meek and quiet spirit, she did not resent the first signs of the attitude which his family were likely to assume towards the connection. She was inclined to take the Sheldrakes at their own high valuation, to feel that she had been bold and presumptuous in listening to the young squire's suit \u2014 she might even"], [121, "The American Cousins 109 have given him up if her own heart had not told her how he would suffer if she did so ; if she had not felt, while she would have been the last person to put the conviction into words, that she was born to be Willie Sheldrake's protectress, from foes within and foes without, no less than his helpmate. If Gussy Whitelaw was seriously hurt by the light in which the Sheldrakes \u2014 all save Willie \u2014 regarded her, it was not so much on her own account, as on that of her father and mother and Sophy. It was hard for her to realise that they could be lightly esteemed, and might be subjected to mortification because of her engagement. No tie of love or friendship could have arisen between Willie Sheldrake and Sophy Whitelaw, or if it had arisen, could have existed for more than a day, save for the link which Gussy had forged between them, the shield of her presence, over each, the common ground of their common regard for her. Sophy was among the people who held him as little better than a lunatic, and she would soon have told him so. She would have in formed him that working men and women were better able to take care of themselves than he was to take care of them ; that he ought to mind his own squire's business, which was not particu larly flourishing, she understood, and let them alone. The best of them would not thank him for his unauthorised interference in their affairs- They were not ill off, or to be pitied, those of them who were young and strong (the old and weak were looked after and cared for by their employers). If they liked to exert themselves and"], [122, "The A4merican Cousins 110 do what her father had done, when he was one of them, they might be as successful as he had been. Naturally Willie Sheldrake would not have relished those home-truths. Sophy wondered what Gussy could see in the young squire, beyond the fact that he was a squire, and Gussy had no such social ambition as burned in Mrs Whitelaw 's breast. It was all the blind infatua tion which people called/' love,\" that Sophy had been disposed to jeer at unmercifully. Now it threw her into a white heat of rage to imagine what such love might do with and for Gussy. It might part her from her family \u2014 from Sophy who adored her, though she could not keep from teasing her when she herself was in a mischievous mood. And what was Gussy to get for what she gave and lost. The maundering absent-minded attachment of a Willie Sheldrake, the insulting repudiation of his family, genteel poverty, endless struggles to harmonise jarring elements. Yet Sophy \u2014 little democrat to the backbone as she was, did not find herself quite averse any more than her father found himself utterly averse to the incongruous match in prospect. Father, mother and daughter had grown up in the heart of the burgher town with the instinctive deference to the landed gentry around them, which is the last lingering relic of feudalism left in England. \" The Sheldrakes of Oakspur,\" along with the other county names and territorial titles dating centuries back had continued potent words to those com moners of Coringham. Sophy had done what her father had not been guilty of doing, though her mother had been by no"], [123, "The American Cousins 111 means equally guiltless on the point, had given herself airs, in daring inconsistency with the young lady's principles, on the arrangement by which Gussy was to marry into a county family. But that was in the early days of the engagement, while it was still a novelty and there was a glamour about it which hid its disadvantages. Now Sophy, like her father, was seeing the affair near at hand and waking up to the drawbacks which over balanced the honour of the connection. \" I don't know what father will say,\" Mrs White law was remarking, wiping her heated face and fanning herself excitedly with her handkerchief. \"It was bad enough when young Sheldrake was not on terms with his mother, and if they were not reconciled he could be kept out of his place, with his pockets as light as she could for very shame let them be, as long as her life lasted. But it is a deal worse with these American impostors, most like, on the carpet. She may cast him off entirely, heartless tyrant that she is, and give his house and lands to his cousins and his sisters.\" \"It will break his heart,\" cried Gussy, in the utmost distress, \" for he loves them all in spite of everything. I saw how he looked when he heard they were to be at the ball, and when in reply to his question whether his sister Eliza beth was to be there, he was told ' yes,' I am sure he felt, at learning that she was to be pre sent while he was absent, though it was his own choice. He has said to me how fond he was of his fine old house, till he began to think of the wants of the people, and of the slums working men and women were content to dwell"], [124, "The American Cousins 112 in. Oh ! how can we ever make up to him for what he has so nobly sacrificed ? \" \" I don't see how his mother can cast him off like that,\" cried Sophy in her puzzled shrewdness \u2014 \"she can't give away his house and lands which were his father's and his father's fathers before they belonged to him, to his cousins and sisters, for the very good reason that they are not hers to give. We have all read of entails in novels, if nowhere else, I have no doubt such high and mighty folks as the Sheldrakes have had their estates entailed for generations and generations. Somebody has been greening you, mother, just to see how you'll look, and to plague you.\" \" Hold your tongue, Sophy, you're too sharp for anything,\" retorted Mrs Whitelaw. She did not enjoy her younger daughter's sharpness at the present moment when it was expressed so as to imply a suggestion of the elder lady's simplicity. She was too much put out to take the implication patiently. \" As if I did not know when a story was feasible and when people were speaking the truth, from when they were seeking to roll my tail. I suppose if there are such things as entails, there are such processes as having them broke. As for you, my poor love,\" addressing Gussy, \" I really don't know what to say about our making up to the young man for his money losses.\" \" Oh ! I did not mean that, mother,\" protested Gussy, shocked at the supposed encroachment on the family finances. \" I daresay you didn't, and girls didn't ought to think of such questions, but older people must take them into consideration. Now if you had meant"], [125, "The American Cousins 113 father's setting him up in some sort of genteel business for hisself \u2014 that might have been reason able, though I'm at a loss to say what kind of business would suit him, unless it were stumping the country and lecturing, and I don't think father would approve of that \u2014 even if it were a money making business, which it is not. But even that would be better than father's undertaking to pay the interest on the mortgages over the estate, or taking them up so that they might not fall into his mother's hands \u2014 if that were still possible. If it had been any other person than you who were speaking, Gussy, I might have been tempted to think it was that you were driving at. No, you need not deny it. I know you are too innocent, and think too little of yourself and too much of others. If it had been Sophy there, I would not be so sure.\" \" Mother ! \" protested Sophy with such animation that she gave another incongruous shove and jerk to the handle of the mangle, and came sailing back to the centre of the company. The substance of the attack struck her as so preposterous, however, that she was more amused than resentful. \" Of course father is well-to-do,\" went on Mrs Whitelaw, \" and would be willing to help you and young Sheldrake, Gussy, within reason. I happen to know, father has had it in his head to start you two in housekeeping, and find a post for your in tended in the meantime. But this news is cutting the ground away beneath his feet in time to come, and is asking a deal more from father. Why it would be to take ever so much money out of the business, besides the whole of the loose capital, and H"], [126, "The American Cousins 114 one never knows what may happen in trade, though your father has been that successful ever since I knew him. Then there is Sophy there to provide for.\" \" Never mind me, I rather think I should like to provide for myself,\" interposed Sophy audaciously. \" It is little you know about it, you goose.\" Mrs Whitelaw felt called upon to put her younger daughter down. \" Father might like to retire from the business as he got older, and to have a place of his own bigger than Daisymead to potter about in.\" \" Why not, indeed ? \" exclaimed Gussy eagerly. \" I am sure father has worked well for it, and nobody is better entitled to rest. We \u2014 he and I \u2014 particularly he, would never wish you to run the least risk or to deny yourselves the smallest trifle in order to benefit us.\" ,: And don't mind me, pray,\" said Sophy with an assumption of loftiness. \" I do not know if I may venture to mention that there is compensa tion granted to the dispossessed men when entails are broken. I believe it is understood to be \u2014 an approach \u2014 let me see, an approach to the value of the rent-roll, for so many years, in a lump sum. Jack Worsley, who should know, since he is in a lawyer's office, told me all about it when I asked him, without giving any names,\" ended Sophia Matilda, nodding triumphantly in her sense of exceptional sagacity and foresight. \" He could easily guess the names. That was very rash and forward of you, as usual, Sophy,\" said her mother, who was not yet propitiated, and still spoke with snappish severity. \" Besides, I"], [127, "The American Cousins 115 am sorry to tell you, father is under the impression Sheldrake is considerably dipped already. His allowance was not a great one for a young man in his position \u2014 that mother of his alwayrs liked to hold the reins and to have him in her power, and he has wasted a deal of money on his radical fads. His trades unions and clubs and things have run away with nearly as much cash as if he had been given to horse-racing and gambling.\" \" Mother, mother,\" protested Gussy, her pale cheeks flushing scarlet and her eyes rapidly grow ing moist and dim as she modestly pleaded her lover's cause, \" how can you make such a comparison ? How can you say ' wasted ' when what he spent was all for the good of his fellow creatures. How few young men would renounce the pleasures of their age and rank, in order to devote themselves to the service of those whom they regard as poor, ignorant and down-trodden.\" \" Few, indeed,\" admitted Mrs Whitelaw sooth ingly ; \" only father do say, that working man's paper young Sheldrake set agoing on his own responsibility, in addition to its being close on red republicanism \u2014 whatever that might be \u2014 meant the cash of the keep of three or four race-horses and a fair share of betting at the billiard-table.\" \" But, mother, the difference of the motive,\" urged Gussy vehemently for her. \" Certainly,\" exclaimed Mrs Whitelaw empha tically ; \" or do you think that, squire or no squire, we should be willing give him our girl ? What do you take father and mother for, Gussy ?

Men may be depended upon for larger, bolder, more uncom promising tactics on any course they have entered upon, than women are likely to pursue. Men are also more reckless, and dogged in adhering to a project, after it has been conceived and in carrying it out to the bitter end, than most women show themselves capable of. The stronger sex are less credulous, less open to conflicting arguments, less liable to fall into a panic and be turned from their original intention than the mass of their weaker sisters are. Elias did not believe half of the rumours in circulation in the town, though he had ascertained for himself that a branch of the Sheldrake family"], [130, "The American Cousins 118 settled in America, had at this date, sent home representatives, whose claims had been accredited, who had been welcomed with effusion, who were being at this moment hospitably entertained at Oakspur. Willie Sheldrake had not concealed the fact, he had spoken of his cousins having called on him and had magnanimously accorded a favour able verdict of what he had seen of them, though in place of being satisfied with regard to the soundness of their republicanism, he was under the private impression that it was rotten to the core. This was, perhaps, the reason why Willie never proposed to bring them to Daisymead, and introduce them to the family of his future wife. Elias was inclined to come to the conclusion that the accidental coincidence of these foreign Sheldrakes' arrival in the country at a sardoni cally appropriate epoch, was the sole foundation for the disquieting gossip which had followed. But even though the worst came to the worst, though there should be war to the knife between Sheldrake and his mother, Elias was not going to draw back from his share of the contract. He was of his daughter Sophy's opinion, that Mrs Sheldrake could not dispose of what was virtually not hers but her son's, unless with his consent to the bargain. If he consented he must get \u2014 for Jack Worsley's coaching had not been far wide of the mark \u2014 in conjucntion with others, a lump sum in compensation for the rights which were re linquished. This might be about the best thing which could happen to him, for he would still be a Sheldrake of an old county family, though no longer of Oakspur. Lingering aspirations to social"], [131, "The American Cousins 119 delights might be gratified, and at the same time there might be a round sum, available for a desir able investmest in the room of a burdened estate in times of chronic agricultural depression. But if this was so, the sooner the young squire \u2014 as he had been \u2014 passed from his mother's control into that of Elias Whitelaw, the better for all concerned. If it were otherwise, Sheldrake would certainly muddle away everything that came to him on some fantastic trade organisation, allotment, enterprise, or co-operative scheme. Though he was as simple in his personal tastes and habits as a gentleman could be, he was as safe to run through any money which came into his hands as if he were a duke with princely stables and kennels, and if they were not sufficient with Monte Carlo at their back. Elias had heard that for a young man to publish at his own expense was a losing game, while for him to turn reformer and philanthropist \u2014 if he were, an honest man and not a rogue, using reform and philanthropy as a cloak for his roguery, was a hundred times more fatal. Elias would find something for his gently bred son-in-law to do. He did not suppose he could make him an agent for \" Whitelaw's bicycles,\" and allow him a commission on what he sold. The fellow would do more of stump oratory on the public's account as he exhibited and cried up his wares, than of sales for his employer. Sheldrake would forget all about the machines, or he would own to every weak point, suggest impossible im provements \u2014 even say a word for the bicycles of rival makers. No, that would never do. Fair"], [132, "The American Cousins 120 play was all very well, but not fair play gone mad. Neither did Elias want a stump orator for a son-in- law. Better keep him well employed. Better tackle his vanity by turning to account his pretty little taste for mechanics. There was the particular workshop in the works given over to apprentices, where they learnt the rudiments of their trade under an old foreman. Sheldrake might be sent there and allowed to take his fling in the matter of models. He might hammer out an invention \u2014 who could tell ? while the position would fit in with his humour for casting in his lot with work- ing men, since he might labour with his hands, and be as grimy as the grimiest in a fustian jacket and trousers. He would soon tire of that craze, but it might serve to begin with, to hold him out of mis- chief. It would be his real apprenticeship which he had only undergone, as yet, in working when and where and at what he liked, and that by fits and starts. It would be the baptism of labour of which the fellow could talk glibly. Gussy would not mind the experience for her lover and husband. Bless you ! Gussy, innocent, en thusiastic soul, would think he was another Peter the Great without Peter's grossness and brutality. It would be a fine story for Coringham that Elias Whitelaw had an opening for gentlemen and young squires in his workshops. Yes, the matter had gone a great deal too far to be given up. He and Mrs Whitelaw \u2014 especially Mrs Whitelaw \u2014 with their two daughters, would be the laughing-stock of Coringham for baulked uppishness, if the match which had been announced were broken oft'."], [133, "The American Cousins 121 Above all Elias was not going to have his good little Gussy sacrificed, slighted, hanging her head like one forsaken \u2014 not if he could help it. If Mrs Sheldrake would not in common decency setttle on her son a handsome life annuity, if she would do nothing more \u2014 he, the tradesman, could make a provision for his daughter and Mrs Sheldrake's son. He would risk it. Hey ! for the immediate hiring that smart little house he had seen in his mind's eye and a marriage \" slap-bang \" as the American inter lopers would phrase it. He \u2014 Elias \u2014 would miss his gentle little bird of a Gussy every day he lived, he understood full well ; but if young Sheldrake were worth his salt, if he were a true man, there was nothing he, Elias Whitelaw, would like better than helping the young couple. Young Sheldrake was a true man. He responded heartily to the plan of immediate action suggested to him, and welcomed the fulfilment of his pledge, the fulfilment which was to cut him off from his people and place in society, as if it were the highest promotion. It was difficult to see how Willie Sheldrake squared all his theories when he put on his coat, and went house-hunting with Mrs Whitelaw, Gussy and Sophy, turning his back on the crowded smoke-stained streets of the old Coringham of many generations, and on the workmen's suburbs of a new regime and pursued his search in the o-enteel neighbourhood of Daisymead after a villa kin which was to be a small edition of Daisymead. He might tell himself that the villakin was for Gussy not for him, and that if he elected to under go privations with his brethren he was not"], [134, "The American Cousins 122 warranted \u2014 not yet at least, in calling on Gussy to do the same. Or he might assert that in comparison with Oakspur a small edition of Daisymead with its cramped accommodation, paltry pictures and trumpery elegances, made for show and not for use, its draughty corners, smoky chimneys, in sufficient larder and dog-hole of a coal cellar, was privation enough. Mrs Whitelaw was full of importance and satis faction, though she would have enjoyed infinitely more having the smallest share in transporting her Gussy to Oakspur and establishing her there, where, Gussy's mother would engage, she would bloom as sweetly as any flower native to that distinguished \u2022parterre. So much was Mrs Whitelaw's heart set on the accomplishment of the feat, that she per suaded herself she would not mind so much though she, Elias, and Sophy were shut out of the charmed ground, if only Gussy got in. Gussy's family's time would come in due course when Gussy reigned mistress of the manor-house, for her loyal heart could be trusted. Apart from the triumphant transplantation which, alas! was looming ever more vaguely and doubtfully on the remote horizon, Mrs Whitelaw would have felt more secure and successful, supposing Gussy had married \u2014 as it would have been the most natural thing in the world for her to have done \u2014 a flourishing manufacturer, or machine maker like her father. Then the house to have been taken and put in order for the bride might at least have been on a level with Daisymead, quite as roomy and with as nice \"grounds,\" requiring a staff of four maid -servants, an upper and an under gardener,"], [135, "The American Cousins 123 besides a gardener's boy, and a groom in plain livery, to drive the brougham and look after the horse and trap. Still Mrs Whitelaw was too shrewd and too concerned for her daughter's welfare not to take thankfully the goods provided for herself and them. It was a fine thing to have a daughter married, and Gussy not yet twenty, while so many other likely enough girls, whom the Whitelaws knew, were hard upon their thirties without word of a husband to anyone of them. No doubt they were not like Gussy, still men so often saw no farther than the length of their noses, and she was a shy, retiring puss, while her looks, though they went beyond the common, were not the best of her. It was a feather in her cap to have taken the fancy of a real gentleman, one of the old county gentry. Birth and connection went for something, even in Coringham, where there was not much of either to boast of. Gussy might or might not be lady of Oakspur yet, in spite of all which had been said and done, but if not, her father, thank goodness, would be able to push on her husband who was \" a dab\" at machinery. Her family would have her all the more to themselves if it ended with young Sheldrake's being settled in Coringham in place of Gussy being removed to Oakspur. Sophy was put in great good-humour by the bustle and excitement of the speedy marriage. She was once more proud of Gussy's making this match and taking the lead of her companions. Sophy forgave Willie Sheldrake all his offences, real and imaginary, she even condoned for the present the insolence of his family and felt herself and Gussy"], [136, "The American Cousins 124 independent of them. How long such magnanimous all-embracing pride would last was a different question. It was only Gussy who was timid, frightened, re luctant, not to cast in her lot with her hero, but to do it so hastily, so rashly, in the face of the opposition he was encountering and the advantages he was casting to the winds. She was without any certainty that his happinesss would be provided for, or that there would be compensation in the new life for what was given up with the passing away of the old. \" Do you really think it will do, Willie ? \" asked Gussy anxiously, apprehensively, as the two stood together on what was little better than a wash ing-green in which geometrically shaped beds of geraniums bearing flowers of a hard regimental red colour were cut out. The green was supposed to be sheltered and shaded from public view by the sparsest background of straggling, leggy young shrubs. In front of the grass was a yellow brick house with prominent bay windows, an ostentatiously high-pitched roof, peaked gables, and an obtrusive slip of a porch. The porch had the orthodox double doors, the outer of imitation oak, studded with imitation nails, to confront the elements, the inner seeking to cheer the eye by long panes of bottle green glass set in a rickety frame. Both doors were standing open, and every window blind was drawn up by the house agent's clerk to admit the necessary light which was to enable Mrs W7hitelaw and Sophy to roam and rummage at will through the minute suites of apartments."], [137, "The American Cousins 125 \" Can you bear it after what you have been accustomed to ? Will you be able to put up with it, if I do my very best ? \" Young Sheldra.ke roused himself from a passing fit of languor, looked up into the pale, beseeching young face, listened to the tender, faltering tones and shook off his deep distaste for the \" bijou residence.\" \" It is far beyond my deserts and desires,\" he told her solemnly. \" I am straining my principles to take so much for your sake, my darling,\" he ex plained with those great far-away looking eyes of his \u2014 recalled from the infinitude of an untried, boundless future, and gazing fondly into the liquid depths of hers. \" Were it otherwise could I ask for more with you here, Gussy, simply you and I ? Why, it will be Paradise, child.\" After that he acquiesced in everything, pooh poohed Mrs Whitelaw's matronly doubts and objec tions, and bore down Sophy's girlish fault-finding like the most ardent and unquestioning of bride grooms. Laburnum Lodge was as nice as possible, the very place for him and Gussy. He could see nothing wrong with it, no room for improvement. He and she would be as happy as the day was long, there. \" The poorest accommodation for servants,\" was Mrs Whitelaw remarking 1 They would serve themselves if that was any difficulty. He should like that best, only Gussy must not be over-taxed : if he could wait upon her and at the same time accomplish his tasks at the workshop, the plan would be first-rate. \" You are too good-natured, my dear fellow,\""], [138, "The American Cousins 126 interposed Mrs Whitelaw\u2014 this was her nearest approach to familiarity. She never took it upon her to call him \" Willie,\" she left that to Sophy, while she was displeased with the girl for venturing on the liberty. \"What about the paring of the potatoes, the steak grilling, the dishes washing ? \" \" I should like to see you trying it, Willie,\" cried Sophy gleefully, \" with your long taper fingers, your book or your papers under your arm, and Gussy wringing her hands at witnessing the pro fanation of your noble gifts.\" Anything would do for furnishing, the future tenant of Laburnum Lodge declared, when in order to be in keeping it ought to be in the simplest style. Nevertheless a little to the alarm of his future mother-in-law and even of Elias Whitelaw with his broader shoulders to bear the burden, he, William Sheldrake, in passing to and fro through the streets of Coringham and surveying the furniture shop windows when he was not absorbed in the problems of political economy and mechanics, picked out, re gardless of cost, everything which took his fancy. He accumulated quite a small store of inlaid tables, drawing-room lounges, garden chairs, work basket and pipe rack and sent them over to Laburnum Lodge, which was to have been the abode of stoical asceticism. \" The chap has never felt the pinch of payment when there's little to pay^ with,\" said Elias grimly. \" He'll arrive at it soon when he comes to the hend of his shabby allowance, for he is too honest in his vagaries to propose to live at my expense. I 'ope Gussy will be able to keep him in order.\""], [139, "127 CHAPTER IX MARRIED IN HASTE Gussy rather appalled her mother by being for the first time in her life obdurate with regard to the choice of a dress. To be sure it was her wedding-dress, and as Gussy was certain, the one wedding-dress of her life, it sounded hard that she should not have what she liked. \" You see, mother, I can never wear anything worthy of him \u2014 duchesse satin, or ivory silk, or Brussels lace if we could afford it, would not bring me a bit nearer to him.

Men should confine themselves to their own business.\" \"I am beginning as I mean to end, mother dear,\" said Gussy, lifting up her pale, sweet earnest face. \" I know we shall not have much to spend now, and Willie is not, and never will be, a money-making man.\" \" To think that a daughter of mine should have that to say about the young man she is going to marry,\" exclaimed Mrs Whitelaw with a snort, provoked out of her ordinary forbearance, \" and for her to talk as if it were a matter for con gratulation ! But you'll have a different tale to tell when the rent and taxes come due and no cash account to meet them. You will not always have father and me to fall back upon, and it would not be fair to Sophy here, if it were so.\" \" You needn't mind me,\" cried the undaunted Sophy ; \" you will not find me marrying anybody who ' is not, and never will be, a money-making man,' \" mimicking Gussy's unconsciously exalted tone. \" Don't be too sure, madam,\" said her mother, turning upon her. \"It is self-sufficient minxes like you who sell their wares in the poorest market. Your turn will come, and I have no hope that you will win a county gentleman.\" \" I don't want one, I assure you,\" declared Sophy, elevating her fine little tip-tilted nose and looking charmingly pretty and saucy. I should not know what to do with him, whether he were a philanthropist with a capital P like Gussy's bargain, or a racing, betting, gambling man.\""], [141, "The American Cousins 129 \" As if father would have anything to say to such a customer ! \" Mrs Whitelaw, who was apt to use trade terms, sought to put down her younger daughter. Then the elder lady harked back on a strand of the earlier argument. \" There is Oakspur, of course, which is the poor fellow's place as it was his father's by every natural consideration, unless that hard-hearted mother of his should play him false, and take his inheritance from him to give it to one of his stuck-up sisters and one of these sly American cousins who have turned up so very pat. But even though our Mr Willie kept his own, the times are so bad \u2014 what with farmers not paying their rents, and land having to lie fallow, that a sharper squire than he is could not make much out of it, and it bonded to the back bone, father says, with the four daughters' portions and the mother's allowance to be furnished first and foremost. It don't want his cutting up the land into allotments, and assigning them to the very worst labourers on the estate which I'll not come bound he won't do, to make an end of the Oakspur rent-roll. Yet the Sheldrakes of Oakspur used to make as fair a show as any family in the county made, so I've been told over and over again,\" ended Mrs Whitelaw disconsolately. \" The allotments might not be half a bad dodge,\" said shrewd little Sophy, who had a commercial vein in her constitution and a smattering of all kinds of knowledge besides her school lessons which she considered she had left far behind her. It was general information not scholastic informa tion Sophy felt inclined to pique herself upon. I"], [142, "The American Cousins 130 \"People are constantly writing about spade husbandry, and if the farmers have failed why not try the labourers? That would be quite in Willie's line, only I'm afraid he would \u2014 as you say \u2014 hit on all the labourers who would shirk work, and not be up to the mark on pay-day. But we've lost sight of our shop \u2014 Gussy's wedding gown. Of what lowly material is it to be, my dear ? The season is getting too far advanced for calicoes and dimities \u2014 while merinoes are out of date.\" \" Are you going out of your mind, Sophy ? \" pro tested poor perturbed Mrs W7hitelaw, \" a calico or a merino for one of my daughters on her marriage day \u2014 I should think not.\" \" I only meant,\" explained Gussy meekly, \" that I might have an Indian muslin like what we used to wear at school parties before we were put into Tussore silks. I have always had a fancy for a nice muslin frock. You may remember,\" she added bashfully, \" that the first time W7illie Sheldrake and I met, on the earliest day he could leave his room after that horrid bicycle accident, I wore one of these muslins. Sophy and I were going to a garden party at the Vicarage, and as it looked like rain, we thought the muslins would wash better than the silks after all.\" \" I don't like to contradict you about what you are to wear on your marriage day of all days,\" admitted Mrs Whitelaw ruefully, \" but what will the Worsleys and the Barnes and the Easts and the rest say of your being married in a washing muslin at a shilling three farthings a yard, to the real gentleman who is to be your bridegroom ? \""], [143, "The American Cousins 131 \" I don't think I need mind what they say,\" answered Gussy with a little spurt of spirit, \"if I please Willie and myself and if you let me have my choice.\" \" There are costumes and costumes,\" said Sophy more glibly than meditatively, \" hunting costumes, yachting costumes, even fish-wives' costumes, but I don't know if I ever heard of a beggar-maid's costume \u2014 since Gussy elects to be a beggar-maid when it is all the other way and the chances are it is Willie Sheldrake the squire of Oakspur who will end by being a beggar-man. I beg your pardon, Gussy, love,\" Sophy hastened to make amends when she saw her sister wince. \" It will not be your fault, but his own doing, and you know you will think more of your lofty minded beggar than if he were a grovelling Cr\u0153sus. I can tell you too, for your comfort, mother, that Gussy is wise, positively crafty in her selection \u2014 a soft fine muslin suits her before everything. If she wears it, with a bride's veil \u2014 oh ! do have your veil of the muslin, Gussy, it will be out of the common \u2014 just like the thinnest, softest of clouds, and her bouquet of jasmine and white roses \u2014 it must be more of jasmine and white roses than of orange blossom, Gussy, because they are more like you \u2014 will be perfectly ripping.\" \" Good gracious ! Sophy Whitelaw, where did you hear such an ugly vulgar word, and how can you apply it to your sister ? \" demanded the scandalised Mrs Whitelaw. \" I am not sure whether it was Jack Worsley or Tom Bayley I heard say it last,\" answered the un abashed Sophy as if she were cudgelling her brains"], [144, "The American Cousins 132 for her authorities. \" I know they have both used it since they dropped ' scrumptious.' It is their pet word next to ' beastly.' \" Gussy was married in the oldest church in Coringham, one which does honour to the old burgher town. She wore her muslin, and she looked her fair modest best in it, as her sister had decided, though its simplicity was marred by the diamond star which fastened her veil. The star had been commissioned from Storr & Mortimer's, and had arrived the previous evening as the last appropriate offering from the bridegroom to his bride to which she could not object. Willie Sheldrake spoke of his gift as of a trifle \u2014 the merest matter of course. But the Whitelaws were not accustomed to diamonds \u2014 the nearest ap proach which they had made to them was in the uxorious promise which Elias had vouchsafed to his wife, that, provided trade were prospering, he would give her a diamond ring on their silver wedding-day. The agreeable thrill sent through Mrs Whitelaw by the sight of the brilliant little star would have been greatly enhanced and not dashed by fear as to what Elias might be tempted to say, if the ornament had belonged to the Oakspur family jewels. But these, after all, were not of sufficient importance to be entailed among the heirlooms. They were interesting and curious as Elizabeth told their story, but they were not of much in trinsic worth. They were in the possession of Mrs Sheldrake. They were not only her property for life, if she chose to retain them ; they were understood to be at her absolute disposal, like"], [145, "The American Cousins 133 so many of the Sheldrake belongings ; if not by legal deed, in right of the private fortune which had preserved them intact till now. If the trinket had belonged to the family of which Willie Sheldrake was the chief repre sentative, Sophy might not have looked at it so critically and curiously, with sundry references to real stones on the one hand, and to paste and Bristol diamonds on the other. Gussy might have handled the token with tender pride, unmixed with regretful awe \u2014 almost terror. The hurried-on marriage was public enough in one sense, but by Elias Whitelaw's inflexible decree, it was private with regard to a gathering of the Whitelaws' friends and acquaintances sum moned to grace the ceremony. \" I will not 'ave a crowd of fools staring at Gussy giving her 'and to young Sheldrake, as if it were the finest thing that could 'appen to her and us.

It incensed Willie Sheldrake himself, aud it equally incensed his family with a mutual unreasonableness which would have been laughable if it had not been grievous. Willie Sheldrake had held no communication with his mother and sisters since he announced his intended marriage, yet he took it for granted that they should know wThen and where the marriage was to take place, and be in circum stances either to utter a final remonstrance or else to make a compromise. To be left in silent con tempt to go his own way was the hardest possible treatment which a lad of his temperament could be called on to bear. It was horrible for his family not to waste word or sign upon him even though he was about to consummate his downfall in their eyes.

On the other side, the family at Oakspur had in effect not heard of the completion of Willie Sheldrake's marriage, which their friends, with few exceptions, did not care to mention to them. The first information the women received was from the announcement in the newspapers. It overwhelmed them with the knowledge that the deed was done beyond recall, surely before it was accomplished Willie might have made a last ap peal, a final effort at reconciliation, though, of course, it could not have been successful. But to carry out his purpose in this cavalier fashion, without the slightest reference to his former friends, was more than they could quietly endure. It showed how rapidly the work of deterioration was going on and how great the evil influence exerted over him by these WTiitelaws. \" They might have paid me the small mark of respect of letting me know when and where the marriage of my only son was to be celebrated,\" said Mrs Sheldrake, with concentrated bitterness, while the crimson of her full cheeks darkened to a painful purple. \" Why, we might have been in Coringham that very dayr,\" complained Mary energetically. \" Think how awkward if would have been to have been told of it on the spot, or to have met the marriage party returning from church ?

I am sure cousin George was reading"], [148, "The American Cousins 136 this paper the last thing before he went out,\" she ended, in a still more aggrieved tone. \" Oh ! that does not signify,\" Elizabeth could not help saying with impatient warmth, and a shade of scorn. \" To try to keep them in the dark would have been a useless precaution. But why could not Willie have come home again for a day, if he could not stay any longer ? Why could he not have bidden us good-bye if he was going to give us up for ever ? Why could he not have told me about it, as he used to tell me everything ? If he wanted to hear what I would say, he might have let me say it. It was cowardly and treacherous to steal this march upon us. To think of Willie a coward and traitor to his family ! \" Then, as Mrs Sheldrake walked heavily out of the room, Elizabeth cried again in her soreness of spirit, \" Oh, Mary, he must be dreadfully ashamed of her and her people, and to think she will be mistress here.\" \" Not if mother can prevent it,\" declared Mary, with cool confidence and something like short sighted triumph. \" Not even after mother's day is over. She knows what is owing to the family if her son does not.\" \" I cannot imagine Willie's not being master here ; it sounds unnatural \u2014 impossible,\" exclaimed Elizabeth, in a low, choked voice, while she stooped forward and held her head between her hands, and was conscious of a suggestion which had occurred to her before, rushing back upon her, taking away her breath and silencing her for the moment.

The mention was made in the briefest, most matter-of-fact fashion, yet a qualified ear could detect a trace of hysterical shrillness in the very brevity and matter-of-factness of the allusion. George Sheldrake did not suffer it to pass in constrained silence as he was probably expected to do. He looked up from his soup plate and said composedly, \" Wall, if I had been aware that my cousin was to be turned off on Wednesday, guess I would have gone over to Coringham without waiting for an invitation.

I am interested to know, for I am going to beat up the quarters of this yere blessed couple, Mr and Mrs Will Sheldrake, as soon as I am safe to And them at home.\" \" I don't see why you should do anything of the kind,\" remonstrated Beville, with some heat; \" it is no business of ours. You can judge the extent of the family^ quarrel, and how the ladies here regard this unsuitable marriage and mean to leave the principals to their own devices. The family will come round in time, I daresay, but at present the members are at daggers drawn. It would be shockingly bad taste, and little short of an insult to Mrs Sheldrake and her daughters, who have been as good as gold to us, for us to interfere at this stage and back up the enemy.\" \"I have a conscience,\" explained George, with a rhetorical flourish ; \" my bosom's lord sits lightly on its throne at present, but it won't sit long if I take to dissembling and pretending to side with Mrs Sheldrake and her gals.

Her son has gone against her dearest wishes, and renounced all the traditions of the English branch of our house. He is a hopeless Socialist, rather than a democrat, which is to be an arrant treasonable fool on this side of the Atlantic. Why should she not buy him out and leave him to follow his bent ? She has her daughters, who will not thwart and affront her.\" George looked at his brother curiously^, while his own eyebrows contracted. \" That is, they will not marry bicycle makers, or the heirs of \u2014 ahem, contractors for railway sleepers out West, unless they have conducted their vulgar operations at such a respectful distance that they are a secret to the community beyond the herring-pond.

She won't wish to sink instead of rise.\" Arrived at Laburnum Lodge, George had to drop the idea of snugness and only retain the assurance of middle-class gentility, striving to put a bold face on matters and assert itself on narrow means. The small, badly -built villas with cramped, yet ambitious grounds, do not look their best in autumn. It required all the comparative space and elaborate gardening of Daisymead to carry off the sere and yellow leaf which was glorious amidst the russet ferns, the orange and green chestnuts, and ruddy beech trees of the spacious park at Oakspur. The poky grounds of a villa which pass muster in their May lilacs and June roses are apt to look seedy and forlorn in October. There is no room for the falling leaves, perhaps also not a functionary whose express business it is to clear them away. One gets a fear of being presently buried like \" the Babes in the Wood,\" only the babes were not buried alive under the pale draggled streamers of the weeping willows (weeping willows always abound in the girdle of trees and shrubs which enclose a bijou residence) and the forsaken yellow of the trefoil leaves of the bending, sprawling laburnums which gave the place its name.

Actually Willie Shel drake had set up a parlour-maid, instead of the hoary headed butler and able-bodied footmen he had left ministering to his mother and sisters at Oakspur. Duly announced, George entered the miniature drawing-room, speculated what he was to do with his long legs when he had threaded the small crowd of little tables and lounges and come to a halt, then found his thoughts suddenly diverted by being brought face to face with a very pretty and piquant, youthful looking lady who stood up to greet him, in her bride's right no doubt. \" How do you do, Mrs William ? I am very glad to make your acquaintance,\" said George heartily. \" I do not think we need an introduction. I am taking the liberty of introducing myself, because we are cousins since the 24th of September \u2014 a date which, I daresay, you have not yet forgotten.\" \" We are nothing of the kind,\" said a youthful voice, startling abrupt, yet girlishly sweet in its note of defiance.

What on earth can have offended the young woman at me?\" George asked himself, and presently set himself to bring her round. \u00a9 But though Sophy was fond of company and read}' to talk as a rule, she was not easily turned from what she considered a ground of serious dis pleasure, nor were her feelings, once aggrieved, readily appeased. The fact was, that though Sophy had opposed her mother when Mrs White law had yielded unwilling, but hardly questioning, credence to the town's-people's gossip after the county ball, and had tried to set up a character for long-headed moderation, wisdom and equity, the girl was a violent partisan of her brother-in-"], [159, "The American Cousins 147 law's as opposed to his American cousins. She was not one whit less violent because she held the same opinion of him as that entertained by George Sheldrake. Willie was a little bit deranged on certain subjects, and her sister Gussy was only a shade less deranged when she listened to him and encouraged him by her attention and interest. But the untoward circumstance of the pair's partial derangement served in itself to constitute Sophy their natural protectress and champion. Their folly was no reason, but the reverse, wiry these insidious strangers should be allowed to com bine with a stony-hearted tyrant, like \"old(?)

For a long time George strove in vain to break down the barrier between him and the irate y^oung lady opposite him, until he grew consider ably interested iu the struggle. She made no charge. She uttered no complaint, but she turned on him a resolutely obstinate cold shoulder \u2014 a prettily square little shoulder it was too, under her tailor-made autumn tweed frock, for there were tailor-made frocks in Coringham as well as at Oakspur.

When the thaw came, it was brought about \u2014 not by Sophy's repressed, but unconquerable sociability \u2014 but by means of a young dog which ambled in full of youthful affability and inquisi tiveness, and began to gambol about the couple with the most ridiculous pupp}^ gambols. \" Down, Duke, down.

Why should not he as a kinsman, though he had not been a wedding guest, supply as a wedding gift some piece of the plate, which, according to Sophy, was conspicuous by its absence from Laburnum Lodge ? He had already bought from the principal jeweller in Coringham a silver card-case for the bride and a companion cigar-case for the bridegroom. They were at this moment reposing peacefully in his pocket till he should produce them as neat and appropriate though somewhat dilatory offerings on the late happy occasion. But he did not mind adding something more substantial to his offering if he could take it upon him to do so. It was a pity he could not put down Beville's name as one of the donors. But the very attitude of Beville's which rendered it impossible to include him in the action, was prick ing and galling George into doing something. Should he take sister Sophy into his confidence ? She looked so pretty and practical as she sat there opposite him, forgetting all about Duke's merits and demerits, while she knitted her soft brows over young Mrs Sheldrake's lack of solid silver plate. \" I've been thinking,\" said George a little bare facedly, speaking in accordance with the title of a widely read story of a highly popular country man of his own, \" that I should like to be allowed to make your brother and sister a present of a bit of plate on the occasion of their marriage.

She remembered it now with an odd mixture of fun and malice. Was there any thing profane in the notion that she had here, by this man's own doing, a warrant to spoil the Egyptians ? If he was ready to rob her brother in-law of his birthright was she not at liberty to take toll of him when he offered it ? She had heard of the colossal fortunes made, not by one or two, but by scores of Americans. Very likely these foreign Sheldrakes were about as rich as the Rothschilds, yet one or both of the brothers would fain rob Willie and Gussy of their ewe lamb, Oakspur. Sophy turned round in her resourceful mind what she had heard her mother enlarge upon as among the handsomest examples of silver plate for a dinner-table. Mrs V\\7hitelaw had seen what she coveted at some tables belonging to o \u00a9 the richest residents in Coringham. She had been"], [165, "The American Cousins 153 in the habit of lamenting the fact, that she herself did not possess the desirable adjunct \u2014 that Elias would not be persuaded to make the purchase. \" I should say,\" remarked Sophy, after a pause given to mature consideration, while speaking with a cheerful alacrity in obliging him, \" that a silver tureen and dish-covers might be something they would care for and could keep always.\" George opened his eyes at the modest request, but he was equal to the circumstance. \" Very well, a silver tureen and dish covers be it,\" he answered coolly. \" You are sure you can afford it ? \" she questioned him, with demurely juvenile impertinence. \" Cock sure that it will not break me, Miss Whitelaw ; you need not trouble yourself on that point,\" he said carelessly. Sophy was half -discomfited, half -relieved, and just a little frightened at her performance. \" I shall give the order when I pass the silver smith's on my way to the station,\" proceeded George in the easiest, most matter of fact tone, \" or perhaps you would do me the kindness of selecting the designs for the little articles.\" \u00a9 o \" Oh ! no,\" cried Sophy, drawing back in alarm and shrinking obviously, \" I don't wish to be mixed up with your present. It was your own proposal to give them a piece of plate, I only helped, at your request, to fix upon the particular thing \u2014 you must really manage to do the rest yourself.\" At that moment she had a vivid perception of what Willie and Gussy, who were never to give a single dinner-party unless to the dwellers in the slums, or by the highways and hedges \u2014 what"], [166, "The American Cousins 154 even her father and mother would think of \" the service of plate\" with the presentation of which she had had so much to do.

In due time there arrived at Laburnum Lodge a heavy box containing the valuable articles of plate Sophy had stipulated for, a card in the box intimated that the costly gift came with the congratulations and good wishes of George Sheldrake of Virginia. Gussy was dismayed and almost distressed. Willie was bewildered and three-fourths indignant, and threatened to send the Brummagem extrava gance back to the donor. Even Mr and Mrs Whitelaw were more startled than gratified by this token of the American Sheldrake's magnificence. \" What does the brother Jonathan beggar mean ? \" speculated Elias, rubbing his forehead. \" Is it a case of bribery and corruption to tempt the lawful heir to turn out ? \" \" It won't be silver or gold dishes either which will tempt the young squire to do what he hasn't a mind to,\" pronounced Mrs Whitelaw authorita tively. \" But there, Gussy has got already what her mother has never attained to, and I have no doubt it is an earnest of still better things,\" and the good woman beamed over her daughter's superior prospects.

In fact it is a point of honour as well as a mark of culture which only the most stolid or the most frivolous will take it upon them to neglect, to be intimately acquainted with storied ground. Thus there are regions where at no season of the year is there lacking an object, nay, several objects to afford an apology for walks, rides, drives, for solitary enjoyment, for house parties, for neigh bourly gatherings.

In this ancient tumble-down house a poet, who belongs not only to England but to the whole civilised universe, was born. In this cottage still quaintly rural in its hoary age, he wooed his \" golden lass.\" In this venerable church his bones lie mouldering. In that stately castle with its towers and ramparts, dating back to the Middle Ages, were enacted some of the most tragic episodes in the Wars of the Roses. In yon still statelier pile of ruins even as the dignity of Life can never compare with the dignity of Death, more stirring events occurred. They form part of a nation's history, a tragedy in which a right royal figure \u2014 the centre of the great ones of the earth in her clay and generation, played a prominent part. The tale was worked out, and left as an undying heritage to poet and novelist. The changes of the seasons, the caprices of the weather, do not touch scenes which in their associa tions are immortal. The Oakspur Sheldrakes had been accustomed to avail themselves, like all their neighbours, of the very superior relics within their reach. Mary Sheldrake, who was nothing if she was not precise, could quote entries in her diary in which among honourable records of Sunday School treats and choir feasts, and G.F.S. days at all of which the whole group of Sheldrake girls had loyally assisted their parson and parsoness, there was abundant evidence that Stratford on its Avon, the town and castle of Warwick, Kenilworth, kingly in its decay \u2014 fit to have been a palace and not the mere seat of a noble, had been resorted to half a"], [169, "The American Cousins 157 dozen times within the year. The practice was by no means intermitted during the American Sheldrakes' stay with their Warwickshire cousins. At the beginning of an unusually brown and russet November \u2014 a veritable St Martin's sum mer had stolen its colours from October so that the leafy7 English elms in their drapery of soft maize colour, the beeches in their rustling ruddiness, the oaks in their tawny livery were still a noble sight to behold, before they flung their rich-hued garments to the winds, and stood stripped and shivering skeletons. Mary took leave to make a pertinent suggestion. When Elizabeth and Beville Sheldrake, with Fraulein Stock and her pupils to act as chaperons, ac according to Mrs Sheldrake's rigid notions of etiquette, were easily persuaded to join the very latest picnic of the departed summer, though its features could present no novelty to them. The little gathering was composed of the ordinary materials, Underhills, Scriveners, Uptons, Ker shaws, and the casual company belonging to them from the country7 houses round. The programme was the same as in innumerable programmes. The party were to ride and drive to Warwick. Those who wished it were to inspect the Castle, Leicester's Grammar School and the Church of St Maiy, where the most splendid and sphinx-like of English noblemen wTas buried beside his second wife. The indefatigable sight-seers and the idle stragglers were to meet and lunch sensibly and comfortably in the principal inn. A farther ride and drive were to take in Kenilworth, where tea might possibly be drunk in orthodox fashion, among"], [170, "The American Cousins 158 the ruins if it was not too late in the afternoon, if rain and fog kept off, and if hot water could be procured. Finally the cavalcade would start and separate as the members took their respective homeward routes. Mary, who had originated the idea, was otherwise engaged for the day. She looked up appropriate entries in her diary and reminded the pleasure seekers: \" Do you know, good people, this is the third time you have been at Warwick and the second at Kenilworth since the month of July ? \" \" Oh, what does it signify7,\" cried Dorothy and Eleanor in one voice, \" how often we have been there, if we want to go again and enjoy ourselves ? It would not matter though we had been thirty times there instead of three. But you are speaking of Elizabeth and cousin Beville.

It wanted no additional surplus population, no malcontents before their time, and so it did not think twice of casting out our fore father Humphrey.\" By this date all the neighbourhood had given Beville to Elizabeth whether or not she was to carry Oakspur in her substitute for an apron, as a fitting dowry. They were ready for the most part, like the typical parent in the play, to throw the pair together, assign them as partners to each other, look on complacently at the association, as if the neighbourhood had made the match \u2014 and finally to bestow their blessing on the happy couple. The last performance included a mur mured \" Fine girl, Elizabeth Sheldrake, but might be the better of seeing a little more of the world, and shaking herself free from all that stuff and nonsense about Oakspur remains and Sheldrake family records, as if no other family in the county had ancestors, an old mouldering house and tablets or a monument or two in the nearest church. A fine new mansion with all the modern improve ments and plenty of tin to spend on it is well worth an old house and a scantily filled purse anyday \u2014 unless to an infatuated dry-as-dust and foolish young worshipper of antiquity.

For that matter, a troubled consciousness growing upon her was causing Elizabeth to make fitful, spasmodic efforts to escape her fate, and get away from Beville. Another impediment to the inevitable crisis was the intolerable sleepless watch and exhaustless curiosity which were ever present and paramount in Dorothy and Eleanor on such special oppor tunities for observation as presented themselves. WThen, oh when, would Beville pop the question ? It would be grievous if the girls missed the very minute, the very act which ought to serve as an excuse for the couple's withdrawal from public notice in order to accomplish their private perform ance. Would it be the pause to gaze at the view which was invisible from the spot on which the gazers stood ? Or would it be the difficult descent of a broken stair ? Or the urgent necessity to stare together down into a draw well ? Or the retreat from an apprehended shower to the shelter of an exposed tree ? What answer would Elizabeth give ? W7hen would mother and Mary be told ? What delightful gay doings, when lessons would be cast aside, would be tbe result ! for of course Elizabeth's marriage would not be passed over as Willie's had been. Would cousin George take as long to make his proposal to one of them as Beville had taken to propose to Elizabeth ?

They were"], [173, "The American Cousins 161 watching with a too sympathetic curiosity, their sister and their cousin, and gloating avariciously over the pair's supposed philandering. They were taking lessons in lore forbidden to school-girls, which with natural perversity they learnt with such ease and alacrity as never came to light when they were thrashing out their music, feebly mastering the laws of art in drawing and paint- ing, floundering in the sloughs of French and German, trudging desperately at their Latin and mathematics. Poor little girls ! Their coveted enlightenment was yet to come. In the meantime they vowed to each other solemnly, that when cousin George made up his mind and threw down the handkerchief, the one sister honoured by his choice would confide to her companion, in a con- solatory spirit, every atom of what he said, did and looked. The solaced recipient would undertake inre turn for this entrancing information to stand guard over the blissful two, so that no inquisitive scrutiny such as the girls had not scrupled to indulge in in the case of Elizabeth and Beville, no intolerable in terruption should mar the perfection of the position. Once more, as on one of their earlier visits to Warwick, Beville and Elizabeth stood on the bridge over the river and looked up at the stately towers and terraces of the castle. She had not now to be his cicerone. He knew and could recall all about the mythical Sir Bevis, and Guy the \" wind chang ing \" King-maker.

To come down to the gossip of yesterday he had at his finger ends the rumour which Elizabeth had told him with so much animation when he first set eyes on Warwick, because she had counted the tale to be his peculiar property7, that critics believed Thackeray had Warwick in his mind's eye when he described the Castle of the Esmonds at the moment that the other Virginian \u2014 manly, simple minded Harry Esmond stood on the bridge and looked in the evening light at the towers and turrets of the home of his fathers. It was on this very bridge over this very river that he was sup posed to stand, and at that very castle he was understood to look. (Might not \" Lady Maria,\" or \"Lady Fanny,\" or the wicked old \"Baroness\" or at least the chaplain turn a corner at any time ?) Beville was familiar with every detail, down to the living peacocks strutting along the nearest terrace, and the hatchment on the wall, a memorial to the last dead earl.

She recapitulated the particulars with slight variations like some ancient verger who having once painfully conned his lesson, says it by rote. He is ready to go over it again and again in the fashion of a talking automaton of which the spring has been touched and the stream of words let loose \u2014 not to be arrested until another touch by a skilled hand puts back the spring into its proper place, and causes silence to reign where babble has prevailed. It was the same at Kenilworth with the shades of the late autumn afternoon and the rising mists of the quickly falling twilight lending a fitting sombre obscurity to the grand ruins of central keep and shattered bastion, of guard room, banqueting hall and dungeon. The ancient gateway was the only fragment intact and habitable of the huge building crowded in its day with scions of the house of Dudley, guests and retainers, whence was dis pensed a splendid hospitality to a sovereign and her court, and to the vast concourse of country people come to gape and stare at the revels. Elizabeth Sheldrake discoursed persistently after a galvanised mechanical mode on Ben Jonson and Sir Walter Scott, on masques and revels, on Queen Elizabeth and Amy Robsart, on Leicester and Tressillian, Varley and Wayland Smith. But it was neither of the eagle queen, nor of the drooping dove of a countess that Beville was thinking when he lingered behind the rush of the party aud pro fessed to investigate a door which appeared to lead nowhere. Not even the attentive Dorothy and Eleanor, dogging the couple's steps, were in sight. Beville glanced around\u2014 -not the crown of Dorothy's"], [176, "164 The American Cousins hat or the flutter of Eleanor's skirt was visible. He drew a long breath of relief and spoke what was on his mind. He turned round, looked imploringly into the averted eyes beside him and interrupted Eliza beth's eloquence with a direct, agitated appeal, \u2014 \" This is the realisation in part of what I have dreamt,\" he said, looking lovingly not at the girdle of mouldering masonry, but at the straight fresh young figure and face at his elbow. \" Unfortu nately it cannot last for ever, and the suspense is becoming unbearable. Will you end the suspense, Elizabeth,\" he besought her humbly, \" by telling me what is to be the awakening from my dream ? \" She was as much agitated as he was. It was natural for her to thrill in unison with him since they were formed in the same mould, and affected by the same influences. But though she was younger than he was in years, she was older in mental discipline. She had the woman's instinct to hide and control her feel ings, and she had entertained for some time a vague doubt and dread of the consequences of coming to an explanation with him. \" I am afraid I do not quite understand,\" she stammered ; \" are we not late ? Should we not rejoin the others, who must be getting tea ready, if they are to have it among the ruins ? \" \" No,\" he said with a determination which showed that though he was fanciful and a dreamer, he had inherited no weakness of will, no lack of force in his character. \" I cannot, and I think I ought not, to delay longer in saying what I wish to say and hearing my fate.

She surrendered at discretion. \" I do care for you, Beville,\" she said softly. \" These weeks have been happy weeks to me too, and I should not like \u2014 I could not bear that \u2014 that they should come to a close, or that we should ever look back upon them with sorrow.

The crisis had come and gone, and the two con spirators so deeply interested in its accomplishment were not there to see, to make a keen and close diagnosis of so interesting a case, and to take copious notes, for their own future guidance. The hapless Dorothy and Eleanor had been decoyed away from their post of observation by the childish delights of being to the front in the preparations for a scrambling gipsy tea. They believed they would never forgive themselves when they dis covered later that the great question had been asked and the answer given in a drama which it concerned the girls to witness, at first hand. Their vigilance had been unslumbering for so long a period, yet, in the short space when it had failed, they had lost the knowledge which they had ardently desired. It was not, however, the argus eyes of Dorothy and Eleanor which detected symptoms in the principals of a crisis encountered and surmounted before they returned to the general company. The defaulters arrived just when the last cup of smoked and sloppy tea had been drunk, and the five left slices of bread and butter had been over turned by accident and recovered with a plentiful embellishment of bits of grass, knots of earth and the last insects of the season.

The riband trade, indeed, went on, one may say, perennially, subject to the caprices of fashion. But the wind and rain, frost and snow, and stygian darkness of winter evenings brought a marked cessation in the bicycle business. No longer were busy streets, less frequented suburbs and quiet country roads infested by the soundless gliding rush, only broken by the occasional im patient tinkle of a bell, of the spider's-web-like little machines. No longer were feeble-footed old women, and children with pattering, tripping feet, and unwary dogs with gingerly paws \u2014 more ready to be run over than to carry their owners out of danger \u2014 prostrated before the latest \" whirligigs \" while the triumphant charioteers careered along defiant of police summonses, fines and doctors' bills. With the comparative pause in the use of what"], [183, "The American Cousins 171 is the dear delight of schoolboys, office and shop lads and the rampant youth of both sexes and all ranks, the demand for the machines naturally slackened in proportion. Fresh orders and calls for repairs lessened and dwindled till the foundries were on short hours, with three-fourths of their men on half time. The dull season of the year was not unantici pated, in fact it was inevitable. Masters took it into account, calculated on it beforehand, and squared their profit and loss by it. It was the unforeseeing hand-to-mouth workmen who were as usual the chief sufferers by the collapse. There were two results from the lull in trade competition. There was the never failing mischief ready waiting for idle hands and brains, and there was the inventor's opportunity of spare hours for perfecting his models and testing and maturing his devices. Willie Sheldrake in the apology for an appren ticeship served in Elias Whitelaw's workshop, was quick to avail himself, not only of the men's limited hours when he studied their tasks and worked in their company, but also of the intervals when the shop was emptied of its mechanics. Even their old foreman was gone and the place was abandoned to \" the gentleman machinist,\" who, like all other amateurs, was red-hot on his fancy while it lasted and set no reasonable bounds to its exercise. Willie worked early and late during these short winter days at the foundry, though Laburnum Lodge and his young wife Gussy, a combination which he had regarded as paradisaical to begin with, were often, in the case of one of them at"], [184, "The American Cousins 172 least, looking out wistfully and longing for his return in vain.

The house was built for a small show place and the lack of substance in such a show had been less felt in autumn than in mid-winter and very early spring. The villakin was far from watertight. Its roof was a snare and delusion, seeing that the ill-fitted, ill-fastened slates were for ever being blown down, threatening the heads of the passers-in and passers-out. Its chimneys smoked unmercifully and were declared by an expert to be incurable, while they were also pronounced so far off their balance and so slightly built as to be in danger of toppling over any day. The insignifi cant array of fancy trees and shrubs which did so little to justify their existence above ground, were, it seemed, never at rest beneath the soil, and were constantly splitting the pipes so that the drains not only failed to answer their proper purpose, they flooded the area and gave signs of becoming as odoriferous and pestiferous as were the Augean stables. The whole wood in the house had been unseasoned, and had dried and shrunk so that the modern window frames rattled and admitted each gusty blast like those of ancient casements. There were no shutters in the upper portions of the house to keep out storms, and the shutters on the ground floor did not meet so that they might be tightly clasped. The gas and bell fittings were equally elegant and airy. Gussie had a narrow escape from being crushed by the sudden fall of the dining-room chandelier ; slight leakages of gas were"], [185, "The American Cousins 173 of such common occurrence as to be beneath notice. The bell wires broke on the least provocation, and, according to \" the bellman,\" would not be replaced on solid and enduring principles unless the whole bell fittings were removed and renewed, if that could be effected without pulling down Laburnum Lodge about the ears of the artificer. Indeed to pull down Laburnum Lodge and build it up again with sound materials, on a rational plan, would be the sole panacea for its manifold shortcomings. Poor Gussy loved her young husband with her whole tender heart. She was as proud of him himself, as proud of being his wife, and as ready to endure all things with and for him as ever. Neither was she exacting or discontented on her own account, she was prepared to make the best of everything. She was ready to be satisfied with what fell to her lot. In spite of it she sat sorrow fully and contritely \u2014 for she blamed herself for every domestic failure \u2014 contemplating the smoke soiled ceiling, chimneypiece and curtains of her once dainty little room. She shivered in the centre of what was likely to become the weather stained wreck of her household gods. She had to nurse the sore throat bred of the draughts, the damp and the exhalations from the out-of-order drains, until she was fain to cry over the downfall of her castles in the air. She was not being a good wife to Willie, she told herself, not such a clever housewife and manager as he of all men needed, another older, abler woman would have cured all these minor evils \u2014 how, Gussy did not stop to explain. Gussy had no support from Willie \u2014 not that she"], [186, "The American Cousins 174 had expected it \u2014 what could he, born in the purple, know of the petty but wearing grievances ex perienced by the occupants of shoddily run up, inferior houses ? How could he guess the difficulty of maintaining a household on an allowance which had barely served for the needs of one man. It was only scantily supplemented by the wages which Elias had decreed, from the most sensible, prudent all-round motives, should not be beyond those which any ordinary full-grown journeyman, rather than apprentice, could have earned, if he had taken Willie's place in the workshop. It was she \u2014 Gussy, who was to blame. It was her soft little hand which ought to have wielded the home sceptre successfully. If things went wrong, if the menage was both comfortless and wasteful, if Eliza and cook did not do their duty, and were scrupulously mindful of nothing save their wages, perquisities and privileges, why, of course it was Gussie who was in fault. She ought to have demonstrated to the servants the error of their ways, and remedied them forthwith. She ought not to have married and attempted to keep house till she was stronger-minded and understood housekeeping better. With regard to the last count, were there not abundance of books \u2014 not cookery books alone, but books on household management telling people what to spend and what to spare, how to \" lay dust,\" and make beds, as well as what dishes to have for dinner every day of the year, above all how to keep within the limits of a small income ? Why should she be so slow and stupid in mastering the contents of this library, or was it true that even in the wisest of those books there"], [187, "The American Cousins 175 was a want of allowance for human weakness and the accidents of life ? If Gussy had consulted her good judgment in place of her sensitive conscience and her loving heart, if she had asked \u2014 not to say her mother, but even her younger sister Sophy, she would have been informed that even the most willing little women in the world cannot accomplish im possibilities. She would have been told, and that roundly, in all probability, while no personal appli cation of the text was meant, that young house holders in Coringham, in whose ranks Willie Sheldrake had chosen to place himself, should begin life, if they intend to end well, by being simple in their manners and customs, handy and resourceful in any domestic contingency and self denying, till they can afford to gratify their in clinations. These exemplary young men do not propose to conduct themselves as a matter of course like squires of the county. They drink beer instead of unimpeachable claret. They are not surprised at the absence of oysters from the menu when oysters are so many shillings a dozen. They do not smoke the most expensive brand of cigars. They do not, when they are not masquer ading in workmen's moleskins, wear coats and breeches boasting the cut of a swell West-end London tailor. Willie Sheldrake, who was con stantly brooding over the rights of man, when he was not inventing strange and wonderful machinery, who went in for liberty, equality and fraternity on the broadest basis, was guilty of all these and of many more incongruous acts. It was to Willie's credit that while he was un-"], [188, "The American Cousins 176 consciously inconsistent, he bore a good deal of what was serious depravation to him, without much murmur or complaint. To tell the truth, he was wholly unpractical at this stage of his history, so that he did not always know what indulgence in particular to which he had been accustomed from his infancy, he missed, and was made physically7 uncomfortable by missing. He restrained the discomfort as well as he could. If he was sometimes a little restless and irritable at home, it was the utmost expression he permitted of his feelings. Gussy freely forgave him every spurt of dissatisfaction \u2014 forgave ? she set down every one of his least gracious and good-humoured moods to her own delinquencies. Gussy might have applied to her father and mother for advice and assistance in the dilemmas in which, to her distress, she was constantly find ing herself, but she was proud, for Willie still prouder than for herself. She could not bear to own even to her nearest and dearest that her husband was not equal to the task he had set himself. It was humbling him to ask additional \u00a9 money help from her father, who, though he was just and good and had done so much for Willie, could not refrain from making certain stinging animadversions on gentlemen in the disguise of tradesmen and workmen \u2014 save the mark ! and on their unconscionable folly. Even her mother could not be trusted to keep her vexation to herself. As for Sophy, who had all the unreasonable in tolerance of youth and spoke her mind, she would be worst of all. Matters were in this condition when, late one"], [189, "The American Cousins 177 afternoon, Gussy was entertaining a caller in the shape of her mother's incubus, Mrs Worsley. Visitors constituted one form of tribulation to Gussy. Willie Sheldrake, who called every rough mechanic stinking of oil and iron a man and a brother, was not disposed somehow, in spite of his alliance with Elias Whitelaw, to include the masters of manufactories and foundries in the brotherhood. The plutocracy of Coringham had no attraction for him ; in fact, the class, though it was recruited to some extent from the ranks of working men, repelled him. The distinction is not uncommon. Many an excellent man or woman who would heartily shake the hand of a hedger and ditcher, or of the dweller in an alms house, would recoil from extending the tips of his or her fingers to his or her grocer or shoemaker \u2014 would recoil all the more if the grocer or the shoemaker possessed such wealth as enabled him to in dulgein the luxuries, if not in the refinements, of his social superiors. The magnates of Coringham, on their part, re garded Willie Sheldrake as a young madman whose madness was not dangerous \u2014 simply because it was so patent to those very sniggering, ungrateful operatives he sought to serve. Willie had no greater liking for the wives and daughters of the snobs and selfish, short-sighted despots, than for the fathers and sons. He had made a great exception in Gussy's favour, when her former associates were taken into considera tion. She was one in a thousand, a precious jewel among common trumpery bits of glass and tinsel ; but he did not do much more than tolerate even M"], [190, "178 The American Cousins Mrs Whitelaw, who had been his zealous advocate, and Sophy who did not know what to make of him, and viewed him chiefly as an aristocratic curiosity to be taken care of, and laughed at under the rose, on Gussy's account. Willie Sheldrake was too truly a gentleman by nature as well as by birth and training to be rude to any woman, he was merely shy and reserved to the Coringham ladies, a manner which, when it was forced on her attention, filled Gussy with re gret and pain. She knew too well that the distant politeness would be mistaken by the recipients, who would call it pride and hauteur, and say he was \" stuck up ; \" her Willie, who thought the poorest working man his fellow, and would willingly7 help him to his rights and improve his lot at any sacri fice to Willie's self. Stuck up ! where was the stuck-up-ness ? There was no help for the misconstruction, how ever, since Gussy was far too meek and modest to remonstrate with her husband on the tone he instinctively adopted ; neither was she qualified to serve as a connecting link between him and what stood for Coringham society. Gussy was engaged in the difficult process of laboriously parrying Mrs Worsley 's pressing in vitation that Gussy and her husband should dine with the Worsleys in the course of the following week. Gussy was aware that not only would Willie detest the obligation, he would in that lordly, irresponsible way of his, which was at the same time perfectly courteous, decline to see him self called upon to fulfil the obligation. He would tell her she might go of course, if she cared"], [191, "The American Cousins 179 for that sort of thing, but there was no occasion for him to go out and make talk at a heavy dinner. He had only the slightest acquaintance with the Worsleys, and he saw no use in cul tivating them. Gussy to go out without Willie, to run the gauntlet of her old set, with the full consciousness that they were under the impression \u2014 the totally mistaken impression that he thought himself too good for their company ! Gussy to see her father and mother, if they were present, as most probably they were among the dinner guests brought together to do honour to the young couple, look mortified and provoked by the bridegroom's failure to put in an appearance ! No, Gussy could not do it. If it had been to please or benefit Willie, she might have tried her best, but there could be no benefit, and in place of pleasing him, he would be a little surprised and disappointed that she should prefer to his company that of people like the Worsleys, who were of no consideration in any sense. And W7illie would miss her, be a little lonely, perhaps a trifle peevish at home without her. Gussy was pleading what had lately been the chronic weakness of her throat, the state of the weather, the impossibility of her being able to say whether Mr Sheldrake would be disengaged or not. She sought all the while to propitiate Mrs Worsley by begging her to take another cup of tea and by ordering in fresh muffins for her benefit. The contest was not an easy one. Mrs Worsley was a self-satisfied, determined woman, with a tall and commanding figure \u2014 as she would have described it,"], [192, "The American Cousins 180 a Roman nose, and a hawk's eye which, as poor Gussy could comprehend, took in every detail of the smoked ceiling and the curtains getting soiled already. Mrs Worsley liked to lay down the law for everybody. She had made up her mind to entertain the Sheldrakes at this juncture, and she was not to have all her plans overturned by a little soft goose like Gussy Whitelaw, whom Mrs Worsley had been accustomed to patronise and order about, and by that high and mighty young fool her husband. Then Gussy heard a sound which her ears had been strained to catch for the last ten minutes. It was the master of the house turning his latch-key in the front door. She did not know whether to be glad or sorry, she would no longer have to speak for him, he was here to answer and apologise for himself and to do it in such a way that not even Mrs Worsley would urge the point further. At the same time Willie hated visitors in possession at the hour when the fashionable ladies of Coringham, apeing their more fashionable sisters elsewhere elected to pay calls. He came home for rest and peace and refreshing confidences with Gussy (and it was hard that he should not have what he sought) \u2014 cumbered with the drawbacks of draughts and damp, smoking chimneys and leaking drains. The drawing-room door opened. Enter Willie, in his mechanic's moleskins as greasy as those of any other mechanic, his hands as soiled as the sleeves of his jacket, his face thin and fine in its visionariness, not free from smudges. He had never done such a thing before. He had always kept a morning suit in the room ap-"], [193, "The American Cousins 181 propriated to his use at the works, and washed and dressed there before he walked through the public streets and reported himself at Laburnum Lodge to Gussy. Even she did not recognise him for a second, and stood aghast for another before she took refuge in calling him fondly, in her mind, her single-hearted, dauntless Peter the Great, without Peter's grossness and violence. Mrs Worsley was utterly scandalised. Young Sheldrake must be mad indeed, insolently mad, to present himself in such a guise to ladies, to sit down in it in his wife's drawing-room. He took a chair which apparently was not kept for his private use, as Mrs Worsley kept a chair for Mr Worsley's father when he was on a visit to the Worsleys, because he had the objectionable old habit of taking snuff. But what was taking snuff to this enormity, and how could that poor cowed child cope with it ? \" I must deny myself the pleasure of shaking hands with you, Mrs Worsley,\" said Willie in the coolest, suavest tone which one could imagine \u2014 that of a man who has always been master of any situa tion in which he found himself. \" I am just come from Mr Whitelaw's works, and am workmanlike, as you can see for yourself.\" Yes, she could see for herself. Have him at dinner? Mrs Worsley would no longer dream of such a thing though he were three times the young squire of Oakspur. A mad communist such as he was would think nothing of coming in sheer bravado, in filthy moleskins, instead of in evening dress. He would soil the table-cloth, the dresses of the ladies who sat next him, the dining-room chairs, the drawing-room lounges. He might eat with his"], [194, "182 The American Cousins fingers to carry out the play. He might carry dynamite in his jacket pockets, she did Dot feel safe in his company and hastily took her leave. \" Have I frightened away a Coringham fine lady ? \" asked Willie, raising his eyebrows when the door closed behind the affronted visitor. \" The most of them \u2014 their husbands, that is, make their living and derive their good things from looms and bicycles. Why in the name of reason should man or woman of them be panic-stricken by finding themselves in the company of one of their operatives, fresh from his operations ? But you are not frightened or offended, darling, by a common-place apparition quite in keeping with the circumstances ? \" \" No, no,\" cried Gussy, flinging her arms round his neck and laying her head on his shoulder, re gardless of her spotless cuffs and collar, \" you are the best, the most disinterested, the most chivalrous man on earth. I do not care whether you come in with your face white or black, or whether you are in a tramp's tatters in place of a workman's dirty jacket, you are my Willie, and none other, all the same. But why did you do it, dearest ? What put it into your head to walk home in mechanic's clothes ? \" She tried hard to hide that she was still trembling from the effects of the late unpropitious encounter, by seeking to laugh and turn it into jest. \" Well, to tell you the truth, my love,\" said Willie, so lost to presence of mind and common care of his household goods as to sit down again to Gussy's horror, and before she could prevent him, on the very dead gold plush couch which Mrs"], [195, "The American Cousins 183 Worsley had just vacated, \"it was because I was told of a bet between two of the hands, Adams and Mullock. Adams declared I was not true-blue, not the real Mackay, and that though I professed to stand up for him and his class and to cast in my lot with theirs, I would not be seen in their colours, in a workman's jacket \u2014 not once in the streets of Coringham. Now I have been seen once and I shall be seen many times, Gussy, if you have no objection. I have told Marsh to send along my things which are at the foundry. It will be quite as easy and a good deal more comfortable for me to change them here as there. Perhaps the fellow was right, and one ought to show one's colours un mistakably everywhere. The people are so given to judging by externals.\" Within twenty-four hours the hue and cry went through Coringham that young Sheldrake had pledged himself to the working men not to put a decent coat on his back again, and that he was prepared to cast knives and forks \u2014 especially forks \u2014 to the winds, and to employ the implements with which Nature had provided him to deal with his viands. Could love of licence, a craving for low company and a strong bent towards anarchy go farther ? Poor, poor Gussy Whitelaw, her worldly - minded parents had overreached them selves and brought her to misery."], [196, "184 CHAPTER XIII WILLIE SHELDRAKE OUTRAGES THE FEELINGS OF HIS FATHER-IN-LAW The worst was yet to come. That winter in Coringham was an exceptionally trying one, both in slackness of trade and in the severity of the weather. The bicycle foundries languished and the riband manufactories, subject to periodical eclipses, happened to be also in a bad way. Four manufacturers and one bicycle maker failed. An other manufactory stopped work entirely, in the men's opinion unnecessarily, and more with a vin dictive purpose of punishing them for having en gaged in a strike for higher wages than to^save the expense of keeping the works going when trade prospects were at the lowest ebb. The great pro portion of both riband weavers and bicycle makers were reduced to half time. The consequent suffer ing, which might have been largely avoided by greater forethought and more prudence in the season of prosperity, was very considerable. White, pinched faces, sullen, fierce looks, idle men lounging about in search of a pretext for working mischief, were the order of the day. Nobody was more interested in the state of the"], [197, "The American Cousins 185 town and the townspeople than Willie Sheldrake was. He was full of it. He was seeking to get grist for the mill of social reform and political regeneration. But wiser and older people than Willie spoke gravely among themselves of the incautious arous ing of the turbulent spirit for which the Coringham working men had been notorious in former genera tions, and of serious riots which had occurred in the town within the memory of the speakers. Many years had been needed to do away with the latent bitterness between masters and men, and to put an end to the class hostility which these riots had engendered. One bleak night in early spring Elias Whitelaw, who had not returned home at his usual hour, but had contented himself with sending out a message that he was detained at the works by special busi ness, arrived, looking fagged and out of sorts. \" Here you are, father, at last.\" Mrs Whitelaw hailed him with sensible relief and kindly satis faction. \"I am sure you must have tired your self with these worriting figures of yours. There is a time for everything. If I had not told cook to let the seven o'clock dinner go and have a nice nine o'clock supper instead, while Sophy and I made a meat tea serve for our dinner, you would not have had a comfortable meal to come back to, after such a day's work and worry as a man of your age ain't fit to encounter.\" \" I can rough it as well as ever I could,\" answered Elias, shortly. He had come into the dining-room, where his wife and daughter were waiting for him, with his hat on his head, an act very unusual with"], [198, "186 The American Cousins him. He still stood with it on while he occupied his wonted place on the hearth-rug. The grate ful warmth of the fire did not serve to propitiate him any more than the cordial greeting of his wife had sufficed to dissipate the fumes of vexation and anger. He proceeded to growl his dissatisfaction with the world in general \u2014 above all with some performances in it which had just come to his knowledge and called forth his ire. Elias could vindicate his right as an Englishman to grumble and growl on occasions, and he had been exercising his privilege a good deal lately in the light of the bad trade season, which was lasting longer and pressing more heavily on Coringham than in average years, and under the galling pro vocation of private and personal annoyance. \" More than me will 'ave to rough it,\" went on Elias, getting moodier and more wrathful every moment. \" I ain't in any great need of pity. I am warm enough to stand the worst winter's slack ness without any pinch to speak of. I can keep my 'ead as well as my 'eels level. Keep your pity for them masters who were in haste to be masters, and so started on tick, and can't afford to let their works go on half-time and their stock fall to an 'ealthy lowness. Then there are the 'appy-go lucky hands as no experience will teach to look out for a rainy day, and their thriftless drabs of wives and helpless little 'uns. But both of them sorts are used to breaking and starving a bit. It's that thundering ass of a son-in-law of yours, Lyddy, who will go to the wall with a vengeance if he don't mend his ways. He'll drag down poor Gussy with him instead of 'oisting her up among the"], [199, "The American Cousins 187 county nobs. What the girl found to see in a lad like that beggar Sheldrake I fail to make out.\" \" Why, what has he been doing now, Elias ? \" asked Mrs Whitelaw, sitting bolt upright in her excitement. \" And it was natural enough in Gussy, and he the young squire of Oakspur and that, not at all bad-looking neither if he had more colour and substance, and with plenty to say to her.\" \" Oh, hang the squire of Oakspur ! \" burst out Elias. \" Oh, for shame, Elias, before Sophy, too ! \" Mrs Whitelaw reproached her partner, as if he had been guilty of the most heinous of oaths. Sophy hastened to put in her oar in her sister's defence. \" I believe Gussy thought more of Willie's speechifying \u2014 he's great at speechifying \u2014 than of his worldly advantages. Gussy was never the girl to set her heart on a high marriage. But there was mother, and you, father, letting the two come together, and when the result, which might have been expected, followed, you did not decline to back him up, you rather urged on the marriage,\" Sophy reminded her father, with audaci ous candour. \"'Old your tongue, Sophy,\" she was told un ceremoniously. \" Who asked for your opinion ? What does a chit like you know ? \" \" What has the foolish chap done ? \" repeated Mrs Elias. \" What has he not done ? \" Elias replied to his wife, sardonically. Then he turned again upon Sophy. \" Oh, yes, take the lass's part ! Ang or fall together \u2014 that is you women's reasoning,"], [200, "The American Cousins 188 and I don't say it's altogether wrong reasoning on the 'ole \u2014 not for women, leastways,\" calming down a little. \"But I have to tell you this much, miss, if you go and do like Gussy, you don't come to me for 'elp and counsel. I've had enough of a fine gentleman for a son-in law, one of the kind goes a long way.\" \" You needn't be afraid, father,\" cried Sophy, indignantly, \" I'm not going to be married, and if I were, I should not choose a man with his head in the clouds, after the cut of Willie Sheldrake. If I did, I should not ask help or advice from you or anyone else when it was too late, I should die first.\" It was Mrs Whitelaw who put down her over confident daughter on this next outbreak. \" Hold your tongue, Sophy, and don't talk stuff and nonsense. You may do a deal worse than come to your father and me with your troubles when they do befall you. Nobody else has as good a right to hear them, and nobody else would take the same interest in them and you, you goose. But what has put you about, father, won't you tell us right out ? We can feel for you, if we cannot do anything more.\" Mrs Elias was on the right track and presently, when the table-maid had brought in the supper and was told not to wait, the grievance was fully aired. \" You know, mother, that I have not been 'alf a bad master to these fellows at the foundry, not only to the steady and long-'eaded lads, such as you know I was in my day, but to the restless and flighty gentry as would dodge their task-work"], [201, "The American Cousins 189 and go on the spree when they had the chance.

I 'ave not reduced the time and the wages a minute and an 'alfpenny more than I could 'elp, when to pay full wages for full time would have been slow ruination.

Mr Sheldrake, who is college bred and counted clever \u2014 you yourself, Elias, have owned that he has shown quite a genius for machinery \u2014 could not be so senseless.\" \" I wish I had never come across his genius,\" groaned Elias, \"it is genius run to seed. As for senselessness, I don't suppose a patient in Colney 'atch could beat him at that trick.\" \" Here is Sarah coming to take away the supper things,\" Mrs Whitelaw was only too glad to inter pose, \" and to bring you something 'ot. Now, father, remember, mum's the word so long as a servant is about. If not, your opinions will be the common property of Coringham before many hours have passed.\" Elias shrugged his shoulders, but he gave in. He had not been accustomed to be waited on in the days of his youth, and he was inclined to think the practice had its disadvantages. He took his revenge for being gagged before the staid, demure table-maid, whom Mrs Whitelaw was punctilious in keeping up to her duties. He was glum and morose in her presence, and when she was gone the comfort of having something \" 'ot \" to swallow did not prevent him from breaking out afresh, though in more guarded terms and with a greater amount of restraint, on his injuries and young Sheldrake's delinquencies. Elias was too manly to"], [203, "The American Cousins 191 desire to frighten his women, and through them probably to create a panic in Gussy. The sub stance of his further communication was that Willie Sheldrake was tampering with the scum of other works besides Elias's. His words might be easily misunderstood. He was certainly stimulating cupidity and inflaming passions \u2014 of which he had little or no suspicion, which he would find it hard to quiet. There was already some anxiety aroused in the magistrates by the manner in which the men out of work kept congregating and loitering in the dismal discomfort of the streets, in the murky mornings and cheerless evenings of an un genial spring. There was even a vague rumour that threats had been uttered against a ci-devant factory hand and present manufacturer. He had practically closed his riband factory for the dull time without sufficient ground for the step, in the opinion of those who were thus thrown out of work, undoubtedly without much thought for the opera tives left without resource in the common strait. There was a speedy illustration of the solid foundation for Elias's angry apprehensions. Before the week was ended there came a night when the grounds of Daisymead were not exten sive enough to drown the hoarse murmur of men worked up to a white heat of hostility, surging through the thoroughfares, and spreading to some distance beyond one of the principal suburbs of Coringham. The final spark which kindled the flame was furnished by news which had come from another trade centre, at twelve miles dis tance by railway. There had been a meeting of the owners of the"], [204, "The American Cousins 192 Coringham foundries and factories held with closed \u00a9 doors in the adjacent town for the purpose of deciding on the advisability of increasing the number of working hours in the mills and work shops, in view of the growing poverty and hard ship experienced in Coringham. The proposal had been negatived by a small majority of names, conspicuous among which was that of Ridgeway, the former mill-hand, the present master of the riband factory \u2014 the summary suspension of which had been regarded with much resentment by the working class. Elias had not long returned from Longton when he was made acquainted with what was in the wind, and in spite of the remonstrances of his wife, sallied forth immediately. He spent the night playing his part in the milie with the collar of his overcoat drawn up to hide his identity from those whom it was not likely to affect favourably. He returned at intervals to soothe the women and report the course of events. His statements were made in a succession of vehemently delivered short narrations to which Sophy especially listened with the keenest interest. There had been no previous riot in Coringham in her day, and she would not have been persuaded to retire to bed this night on any account. She would have liked if she had got her will to have gone out with her father and seen the row, but when she said so, not only did her mother forbid her absolutely, her father told her sternly that if it ever happened that she should witness such a sight she would never wish to see it again. Elias's first tidings were comparatively reassuring. The mob was contenting itself with parading the"], [205, "The American Cousins 193 streets, shouting and singing, a process in which it was to be trusted it would expend its energies. When he next came in he contradicted himself. The leaders in the crowd were arming themselves with branches of trees and iron railings, which they cut down and tore up to serve their ends. He had seen Sheldrake, was Elias's third indig nant story ; he was too far off for Elias to get speech of him, even if it would have been any good. He would see now the mischief he had been stirring up. His short-sighted ey7es might be opened too late. Ah ! the people had got a definite object at last. They were streaming in the direction of Ridgeway's factory. They made no secret of their intention of bursting open the doors, smashing up the machinery and gutting the whole place. That job finished, they were bound for Silverbirches \u2014 Ridgeway's country house half a mile from the town, to subject it to the same treatment, and put a match to whatever would burn. Elias was thankful to say (for even Sophy was beginning to tremble and cry, she had been to school with Dolly Ridgeway) that neither Ridgeway nor any member of his family was at home. The speaker chanced to know7, for Ridgeway himself had mentioned the fact in the course of the morning's meeting at Longton. He had said that his wife and children were at Torquay, and that he would start to join them as soon as the meeting broke up.

Elias was unable to sit warming himself before the fire at this point, he had to tramp up and down and insist on equal justice being dealt out. Presently he had to administer fresh comfort and encouragement to his listeners. The devil's spawn had got out the roiters' heads for a bit, but there was not the ghost of a danger that they would be suffered to command time and oppor tunity to commit further havoc than that they were carrying out at Ridgeway's. The command ing officer of the soldiers in the nearest barracks had been wired to, and his men would be on their way by this time. \" Good Lord ! \" Elias burst in upon his little company of weary watchers with the sweat drops gathering on his honest beetle brows, in spite of the cold of the early morning. Sheldrake had been in the thick of the fray all along. He had been present at the destruction of the factory which he could do nothing to prevent, and he was now posting with the blackguards to Silver birches. To control and quiet them forsooth ! to get them to disperse quickly ? They might as well say he was going to read the Riot Act, as the Mayor had tried to do before the Town House in vain. He might as well attempt to stop the sea or put out the improvised flaring torches with the breath of his nostrils."], [207, "The American Cousins 195 Gussy's terrified version of the matter went for nothing. Elias had made his way to Laburnum Lodge and seen that there was no use in contra dicting her, and sending her out of her wits. Let her in the meanwhile keep her conviction that Sheldrake was calming the men down \u2014 pouring oil on the troubled waters. It was a deal more likely that some of the fellows he had roused to frenzy would turn upon him at the first word of protest, and maul him as a meddler and mar plot, a turn-coat and traitor, when the decisive hour had arrived. If that was not the result, the alternative would be, he would be inextricably7 mixed up with the ringleaders against whom he would not turn Queen's evidence \u2014 small thanks to him who had been as good as at the bottom of it all ! he would be ridden down by7 the troopers, or arrested by the special constables. He would be regarded with the memory of his inflammable speeches and communistic arguments sticking fast in men's minds, as the most pestilent rascal of the set \u2014 and the charge would not be by any means without truth ; he would be clapped into a cell of the common jail of Coringham, with the worst of the crew, and the end would be he would be sent as a convict to Woking or Portland. \" Oh, mercy on us, Elias, don't say such terrible things,\" implored Mrs Whitelaw. \" Think of poor, poor Gussy's wretchedness. Oh, who would ever have foreseen such an en d? \" \" Woman, will my being silent h'alter the natural consequences of stark, staring conceit and folly ? \" cried Elias in the height of his impatience and vexa tion. \" The lad is as mad as an 'atter.

Young Sheldrake of Oakspur \u2014 not dreaming of making his escape or of defending himself, or of accusing his associates \u2014 was the first man collared and dragged off by the combined forces of the special constables, the ordinary police and the dragoons. He did not deign to offer an explanation of his presence, either at Ridgeway factory or at Silverbirches. The farce of his being laid hold of, when he was doing his best to quiet the disturbance, together with the further outrage ous proceeding on the part of the authorities, of his being brought back to Coringham and locked up in tbe jail, was too egregious a blunder to be viewed seriously. Besides, though Willie was strong in the inno cence of his motives, he was writhing under the intense disappointment and mortification of the sequel of his course of education to the masses. They had misunderstood him in every sense. Egregious as the blunder was, which had placed him in his present position, Willie was in the very circumstances of Lear's faithful follower Kent, when, however absurd the assertion might sound, there was no denying he was in the stocks. Willie was a prisoner locked up in Coringham jail. It required all Elias W7hitelaw's influence and efforts, exerted through the remainder of the night and the earlier part of the following morning, to establish the urgent plea, that a man's wild theories if it could not be proved that they had been borne uot by wilder practice, were his private property,"], [209, "The American Cousins 197 with which the law had nothing to do. It was only after a struggle the substantial bail was accepted which could get Elias's precious son-in law out of durance and carry him home to Gussy before the poor girl went fairly demented.

Gussy, who had never questioned her father's authority or disobeyed him in her life, had flatly refused to quit her husband's house and accompany Elias back to Daisymead, when he had gone a second time to Laburnum Lodge, and knowing the misery which awaited her, had striven to fetch her away with him. She would not consent to be absent from home when Willie might return at any moment. She would be there to welcome her hero \u2014 her martyr it might be. She would have been proud of his laurels, she would be prouder still of his scars. If Gussy had lost her wits they were replaced by a state of strong exaltation. She was ready to follow Willie to prison or to a convict settlement, if such were to be his sentence, she would ask nothing better. \" Good 'eavens ! \" as Elias was driven to cry, \" what infatuated fools women are to be sure ! \" Willie Sheldrake was permitted to go out on bail, and as nobody could say he had been seen to strike a blow, to batter a loom, or to lodge petroleum under a grand piano ; on the contrary7 he had been observed to ward off blows and to seek to arrest would-be incendiaries, it was to be hoped he would never see a convict settlement. But his character for sanity and sobriety, not to say for dignity becoming his birth and station, seemed lost beyond recall."], [210, "198 CHAPTER XIV MRS SHELDRAKE'S TEMPTATION \u2014 THE TUG OF WAR FOR ELIZABETH AND BEVILLE \" Oh ! my dear Mrs Sheldrake, it is a special inter position of Providence on your behalf. It is what we read of in Holy Scripture, you know, I mean about the wind's being tempered to the shorn lamb.\" The comparison was unfortunate. Mrs Shel drake with natural monumental heaviness of body and mind, increased by a weight of trouble, was more like a dull, over-borne old sheep than a shivering lamb, capable of frisking away its cares the next moment. The speaker went on zealously, working the same vein of consolation with the best intentions. \"A natural successor to poor, misguided; Willie has been provided in Elizabeth's future husband \u2014 a Sheldrake of the Sheldrakes \u2014 not only the name but the very face and air as little spoilt by Americanism as one could well imagine.

Elizabeth and her husband, who is a Sheldrake out and out, can have the estate, and you can make it up to Mary and the younger girls and still afford a liberal pro vision for poor, poor Willie, in the station he has chosen for himself.\" The speaker was not Mona Kershaw with her sharp arrows designedly barbed, hidden beneath every suave word. It was Lady Thorndale, the best natured, most kindly soul in the county. She had driven over expressly to Oakspur honestly to condole with and comfort Mrs Sheldrake, in the exceptional misfortune which had befallen her. The visitor was doing her best to discharge her benevolent mission while the two ladies sat tete d-tite together, in something of the luxury of woe, at afternoon tea in the drawing-room at Oakspur. There were offences which even Lady Thorndale considered socially unpardonable \u2014 quite beyond being passed over. Willie Sheldrake \u2014 her young friend in former days \u2014 had committed a series of these offences. He had separated himself from his family and class. He had been guilty of a misalliance with unvarnished trade. Then his radical and democratic principles, rapidly develop ing as might have been expected in such an at mosphere, he had allied himself with stump orators and slum socialists of the lowest type. He had been prominent in a Coringham trade-riot, for which he was taken up and put in jail. He had been got out by the instrumentality of the trades man, his father-in-law. The judge \u2014 when Willie"], [212, "The American Cousins 200 Sheldrake presented himself for trial, since the whole case was too grave to be dealt with by an ordinary magistrate \u2014 the judge had not contented himself with inflicting a fine, he had administered a severe rebuke to the culprit before dismissing him from the dock. What a position for a squire and a Sheldrake ! he would never, especially with the clog of the under-bred wife and her relations at his heels, recover from it. Certainly Lady Thorndale had not been sub jected to such a dispensation. The nearest thing she could imagine to it, and it was characteristic that she recalled the episode and compared it to the other trial, was that long ago, when Lady Thorndale was a girl, her father and mother had the misfortune to own a wild young son. After he had been rusticated at college, he had sunk so low as to perpetrate the social enormity of cheating at cards, and was detected in the deed. It was of this early tabooed and exiled brother, whose face she had not seen since she was in her first girlhood, whose memory was but a blot of misty family grief and anxiety in her mind, that Lady Thorndale was thinking when she resumed the conversation in the friendliest spirit of solace and help. \" If you would take my advice, dear Mrs Sheldrake, you would try and get poor Willie to emigrate with his wife to some place \u2014 gold or diamond field, or ostrich farm, where there is an equality of rank, where he would have no excuse for airing his strange notions, and where they would attract no attention if he did air them. I remember my father got my poor young brother, Barnard, to go away directly, where his name was"], [213, "The American Cousins 201 not known and the scandal could not crop up. Perhaps you never heard there was a ne'er-do-well among my brothers, the case was so carefully hushed up at the time, but there was such an unhappy scapegrace, and we felt all the painful circumstances very7 much, when they occurred, I assure you, but you can see we have lived them down. Barnard went out to South America and settled there. He did try to come back once or twice, poor fellow, but when he saw it was no good, that he had put himself beyond the pale, and could not be received among us again, he sub mitted and took to the life on his ranch, married, had children, and I daresay has been happy enough in his way. The advantage my people had was that there was no silly wife in England to stand out against Barnard's going abroad, with her horrid relations at hand ready to interfere and make more mischief. But you must be firm, dear, for your own sake \u2014 for everybody's sake \u2014 Willie's amongst the rest, since, as Thorndale says, the boy has done for himself at home. It would be too lamentable to have him going on living almost within your sight, in this dreadful way, walking about in workmen's clothes, living with working men, getting into seditious scrapes which end in fisticuffs, county jails, and terms of penal servitude. My dear, my dear, you must not allow it. Think of yourself, of your girls and their prospects, even of Willie, as I said. Buy up the mortgages and foreclose them ; I don't understand a word I am saying, for, as I need not tell you, I am no lawyer, but that is what people who know are insisting.

Pay your son and his wife a round sum on condition that they go out of the way as fast as possible, before he can incur further disgrace. Forgive me for hurting you, dear Mrs Sheldrake, but somebody must speak out and put the matter plainly before you. I know that is what Thorndale thinks, though he does not like to come forward prominently and volunteer his advice.\" \" Instead of taking amiss any opinion you have favoured me with, Lady Thorndale, believe me I am much indebted both to you and to Lord Thorndale,\" said poor Mrs Sheldrake, formal even in the depth of her distress. \" I know you have come over to do what you can to aid me and, indeed, I appreciate your kindness. But such important business matters cannot be settled in a day as Lord Thorndale will understand. I may say this, you and the neighbours are right, as far as we can foresee ; my daughter Elizabeth will be married to Mr Beville Sheldrake, with my entire approval, some time during the summer \u2014 whatever else may happen.\" Mrs Sheldrake drew a heavy sigh, which in a woman of her habit of body7 had a gusty depth about it which partook of the con sistency of a wheezy groan. It was fully three months since the tea-drinking under difficulties among the ruins of Kenilworth, in the wan dusk of a November afternoon, when Beville improved a brief opportunity by asking Elizabeth to be his wife. Elizabeth answered"], [215, "The American Cousins 203 \" Yes,\" like the frank, large-hearted girl she was, without a particle of affectation of doubt and demur, yet with a haunting arriere pensie in her mind which robbed the happiest moment in her life of much of its spontaneous joy. Mrs Sheldrake's consent to the simple fact of the marriage, without any complication, had been asked and obtained at once, and the engagement had been openly acknowledged ; but from that point the affair had stood still somehow, without any lack of ardour on Beville's part, or any excess of coyness on Elizabeth's side. There had been an unadmitted reluctance to proceed with the arrangements, a disinclination to fix the date of the marriage, an apparent desire to wait till the couple knew each other better, and were individu ally half a year or a whole year older. Why7 should they when one considered the entire sym pathy and close friendship soon acquiring a tone of tenderness, which had been early established between the cousins ? Further, they were both of age, and they were both (lucky people !) well furnished in this world's goods. There seemed nothing to wait for, nothing to delay the happy consummation of a marriage which promised, if ever marriage promised, to be a thrice blessed union of heart and soul. There was but one excuse for procrastination in the parting between Elizabeth and her relations if she went with her husband to America. The step had neither been definitely mooted nor contradicted since Elizabeth had made the passionate declaration of her view of a wife's duties, and of her longing to become acquainted with her husband's country"], [216, "The American Cousins 204 and birthplace, in the first blush of her engage ment. George Sheldrake spoke of his cousin's transfer across the Atlantic as a matter of course. Dorothy and Eleanor had picked up a sentimental devotion to Yankeeland, and had leapt to the conclusion that Elizabeth must share the devotion, but these three formed exceptions to the rest of the family in their conduct. Mrs Sheldrake never alluded to her daughter's leaving England, as if the subject were too painful to be discussed, till the discussion could no longer be avoided. When Mary mentioned the probability, it was in a blun dering, hesitating fashion. Partly in impatience of the uncalled-for delay, partly to afford a decent excuse for it \u2014 as George said, though even this protest was not frankly stated and openly urged but seemed to hang fire like the rest of the preparations, George and Beville Sheldrake agreed to take a run back to the States. They would make a run \" down south\" on their own account to settle what they had to put in order, previous to the change in their circumstances, for there was no question that a change in Beville's condition would also mean an alteration in his brother's plans. The brothers had gone and come again with the marvellous celerity which counts one of the giant oceans of the world little better than a babbling brook to be crossed without thought or trouble. In rebuke of the audacious rashness of their speed, George and Beville found the marriage was still a nebulous event in the time to come, for which no settlements had been prepared, no lawyers and modistes put upon their metal."], [217, "The American Cousins 205 Then the riot in Coringham took place with Willie Sheldrake's share in it. It was but a passive performance on his part, but it served to put the climax on all his other outrages of pro priety and good taste, and it was calculated to procure for him \" the redder's lick,\" in shape of the profound distrust and displeasure which he awoke in both sets of belligerents. George laughed and shrugged his shoulders when he heard what his cousin had been about, Beville turned away in supreme disgust. He would not hurt Elizabeth's feelings by breathing- a word to her on her brother's behaviour. The result was that Elizabeth, already ashamed of her brother, and bitterly angry with him as men and women are apt to be when those they love turn their regard into a source of cruel affront and sharp pain, took up the idea that the worst of Willie's conduct had not been reported to her, that it was past being spoken about by sane and honourable people. Mrs Sheldrake saw the time had come when she must put in force the halting resolution which she had held in reserve ever since her son's marriage. She must buy him out, and get him to renounce all claim to his father's estate, if she would act in accordance with what she conceived would have been her husband's wishes in order to preserve the credit and well-being of the family. She went up to London and saw her lawyer and was in con stant communication with him on the subject. Through him she interchanged business letters with Willie, who, instead of rebelling against her decision and moving heaven and earth to retain"], [218, "The American Cousins 206 Oakspur, was exasperatingly cool and indifferent in the matter. He acquiesced easily in proposed changes which ought to have been of vital im portance to him. He had no objection to his mother's taking up the mortgages, possessing her self of his natural inheritance and bestowing it on his favourite sister and the other man to whom she was to be married. Further overtures of friendship had not passed between the Americans and Willie, though George had managed to introduce himself to the Whitelaws, and had fraternised with Elias. He had fallen into the habit of dropping in when he was in Cor ingham, either at the foundry or the house, and holding long discussions with their owner on trade \u00a9 \u00a9 and mechanics, and little passages-at-arms with Sophy on things in general. Mrs Sheldrake was deliberately executing her threat in righteousness, not in wrath. She had said her son should not touch a farthing of her money when his only offence had been that of proposing to marry beneath him, without her consent. Now, when he had done so much worse she was willing to indemnify him for the money value of the property. Mrs Sheldrake did not speak of what she was do ing, she left her daughters and their friends to guess it and to keep her counsel. Mary might have been the most restive and the least satisfied to remain in the dark, had she not received an assurance that her portion of from fifteen to twenty thousand pounds w7ould be nearer forty thousand, to make up for the priority in the succession to Oakspur awarded to Elizabeth when she married into the elder branch of the Sheldrakes. As it was, Mary"], [219, "The American Cousins 207 felt a little huffy and sulky on account of the fact that she was not to be made an eldest son of. But she told herself that she would not on any account have married either of her American cousins if she had been asked. She would not have run even the smallest risk of spending so much as a part of the year in America where all the tag, rag and bobtail of the country would count themselves her equals. There she would have negroes for servants. There gentlemen wore galoches or rubbers over their boots. There she would have to hear \" rockers \" rocking on every side of her, and to see boiled eggs supped out of cups or glasses. There the English social duties she knew she discharged so well would be left behind with her mother and the girls and her other friends. Still it was not nice to be passed over, and Mary could not be certain in her mind that Elizabeth, who had professed to be so very fond of that unfortunate Will, had not foreseen everything from the beginning of her acquaintance with the American Sheldrakes. If so, it was all very well to speak of Elizabeth's high-mindedness and disinterestedness even in the matter of being willing to take Oakspur in lieu of her portion, and to consent to its being burdened with part of her sister's portions when agriculture was still so de pressed and land below par. Nevertheless Mary would not be convinced that her sister's behaviour in the business had been perfectly straightforward and above board, Elizabeth looked as if she was sensible of it, her conscience did not seem easy. Mrs Sheldrake preserved her composure in the difficult circumstances. She had one constitutional element which is supposed to belong to blood and"], [220, "208 The American Cousins culture, she could practise self restraint to any degree. Her full, high-coloured face lost no particle of flesh or colouring, not a single tear glistened in the somewhat hard, set eyes. Yet when the girls were in their rooms and the servants gone to bed, she would struggle to render lighter and less audible her heavy tread and the slippers which would creak as she crept up to the old forsaken nursery7. She would look round her \u2014 always in one direction where \" Boy's \" battered rocking horse still stood, and where his cradle had sometimes been carried, and his father had gone up with her now and then, that they might look together at their son and heir. Why had he rendered himself unworthy, until it was better for him and for the others that he should relinquish what he neither prized nor dealt with fairly7, better that he should go away into the obscurity \u2014 the low company he preferred ? Lord and Lady Thorndale were right, even as they had striven to be kind. With that Mrs Sheldrake's mind wandered slowly and ponderously back to the first occasion on which she had met Lady Thorndale \u2014 the memorable occa sion when her husband, the squire of Oakspur, had escorted her in her bridal finery to the county ball and presented her to the best of the county people. Everybody had been gracious and friendly, and several people had admired Dame Eleanor's pearls which she had worn in their new setting. Was she not bound to live up to that proud night, to Dame Eleanor's pearls, to Lady Thorndale's and everybody else's friendliness to the promoted woman's husband's kindness in giving her such honourable surroundings ?"], [221, "The American Cousins 209 The recollection of the scene was so vividly present to her that it remained with her in the background of her thoughts for days, so that she talked again, as she had often spoken to her daughters before, of her first introduction to the neighbourhood. She gave them once more in de tail all the particulars, the silent woman growing almost garrulous on what this lady wore and how that gentleman spoke, and what a deeply gratifying moment it was for her \u2014 the London girl \u2014 to feel herself thus made free of county society. The listeners marvelled what had come over mother that she thus should tell anew with such unction the old well-worn story. Mary had said that Elizabeth looked conscience stricken. But it was not conscience alone which was stealing away the rich blood that had formerly come and gone with a word or a thought in the otherwise colourless cheek, was lending a nervous quiver to her formerly firm lips and causing her eyes to burn with feverish unrest. It was the madness of being wroth with those we love, the anguish of knowing her brother Willie \u2014 once her comrade and darling \u2014 to be little better than a reckless reprobate and vaga bond. He was one who had incurred the prison brand and might yet wear the dress and lead the life of a convict, he whose ancestors had sat in the robes of Sir Beville of Stratford church at a Queen's council table, and died knightly deaths on the battlefield.

He loved her, oh yes, he had loved and chosen her from the beginning, but that had not prevented a gleam of covetous greed from stealing into his eyes on the day when he arrived at Oakspur on his return from America. He looked round him once more on the hoary oaks of the park \u2014 the last trees to put on their spring bravery, on the crumbling mullions of the windows, on the worm-eaten oaken settles and chairs, on the partly defaced chimney-pieces, and the family portraits \u2014 some of them sufficiently wooden and grim. He valued these relics of the past as she valued them. Why should he and she not have them by perfectly fair means from one who set no store on them, who would sooner hob-nob with a greasy mechanic \u2014 a vulgar trades man, than keep with his kind and follow the pursuits of a country gentleman, to which he was born. Why not, indeed ? But then what became of the purity of the true love which counted the gains of its exercise, and aspired to a reward for its indulgence ? If Oakspur had been indubitably7 hers to do with as she chose from the first, she would have hastened to invest him with it, she would have lavished it on him with a generous woman's delight in giving, and a proud expendi ture of her best on him. But that was different \u2014 to think that he might have taken it into account originally, that he might have had it in his thoughts and plans, that he and she had in a sense conspired to rob the most unworldly, the least calculating man in the world of his rights, was gall and wormwood to Elizabeth's loyal spirit. She drooped under the"], [223, "The American Cousins 211 perception from which she could not escape. She grew uncertain and inconstant in her spirits and temper in a manner utterly foreign to her. She treated her very lover with a capricious way7 wardness which was utterly unlike her, that tried his unswerving, unbounded devotion to the utmost. But Elizabeth steeled herself against giving in. She sat in the old panelled room of the former Elizabeth Sheldrake, and clung to its storied relics, its dim religious light. She asked herself what that predecessor would have thought of the sacri lege of committing the beautiful house of their fathers to be wasted and debased by a perverted and disgraced Sheldrake ? Willie would cut up the old meadows and fields, with their historical names and associations into allotment strips, and convert the venerable park into a tea-garden for the use of Coringham excursionists, who would be thenceforth his chief visitors. What would the Coringham bicycle-maker's daughter do with the old \" Elizabeth Sheldrake Room \" ? Lock it up and leave it to rats and bats ? Or tear down the panelling, plaster the walls, cover them with a flashy wall paper, remove Elizabeth's dear old blinking small-paned windows and substitute for them staring windows of a single pane, and pique herself on having let in the light and brought the room up to date by a cheerful restoration ? Would Willie let her make short work among the family papers, clearing them away as so much rubbish ?

The trial might sound to weary"], [224, "The American Cousins 212 wights as one of the sorrows of gentility \u2014 fantastic and unreal, but it was sufficiently real to Elizabeth. Better hide herself away in what was left of Humphrey Sheldrake's Virginian log-house. Far better nerve herself to act for herself and for others, for the sake of the future as well as of the past. Was she not justified, nay, bound to prevent the destruction of the boast of the antiquaries \u2014 one of the proud possessions in a county which claimed Stratford-on-Avon, Kenilworth, and War wick among its treasures ? Oakspur had been the delight of her eyes and the pride of her heart since she could toddle about the corridors and play hide and-seek, and battle-dore and shuttle-cock in the disused ballroom. Ah ! who was with her when she played ? Not Mary, who had never cared for any livelier and more picturesque entertainment than keeping house and dressing dolls. It was Willie and Elizabeth who had called themselves \" Sir Beville and Dame Cordel \" and mimicked the days of chivalry when now the dame was arming her knight and sending him forth to the wars, and anon she was welcoming him home, binding up his wounds, and singing the record of his gallant deeds to the accompaniment of her lute. But the Willie of to-day cared for none of these things \u2014 who could recognise the old Willie under his present trans formation ? \" Do you think they will have a great quarrel ? \" suggested Eleanor, with breathless interest, to Dorothy.

I wonder Beville can stand it. I heard George telling him he was having the spryness taken out of him. Neither you nor I will behave to George in such a fashion, Dolly, when our turn comes ; for one thing I don't believe he would put up with it. Oh ! I think there must be a bad quarrel.

Anyway you are mine, mine, Elizabeth, for good or ill, as though we two were alone in the world, as though we had already stood together in church and pledged our vows before the altar.\""], [228, "216 CHAPTER XV A JUST JUDGE George Sheldrake began to be much exercised in his mind. He saw what Mrs Sheldrake was about. He thought he also saw what his brother secretly desired, and the conclusion to which Elizabeth in her revolt against her brother's actions was drifting. It was difficult for George to interfere. It was not exactly his business. He was hampered by the absolute conviction that Beville and Elizabeth had started on their mutual attachment in pure disinterestedness ; that they loved each other at this moment as kindly and blindly as if there wrere no Oakspur lurking in the background of their destiny. Had it been otherwise George would have come forward with an open indignant pro test, or he would have dropped the two in bitter mortification aud disappointment, in sick disgust as a couple of heartless plotters and schemers. As it was it sounded little short of an insult to a pair of cooing doves to accuse them of not being single-eyed in their attachment. They had been prepared from the beginning to fall in with Mrs Sheldrake's proposal of disinheriting \u2014 by buying"], [229, "The American Cousins 217 out, her son, her only son, in order that they might step into his shoes and become the owners and representatives of the old acres, the old manor house and the old name which held a fascination for the two enthusiasts. \" There is one thing,\" George told himself, with a grimace, \" I ain't so ignorant of the bearing of one half of a commandment as I used to be. I could always kinder guess that a man might covet his neighbour's wife, though women are ticklish commodities at the best. But as to setting his heart on so much weather-stained stone or brick, crumbling plaster and rotting wood, and cumber ing his conscience that he may call it his, is real difficult to comprehend \u2014 in spite of Naboth's vine yard \u2014 and though I've always thought I liked the old Virginny hole whence I was drawn or digged, as well as most men like the ground they and their people before them were raised on. If old Humphrey Sheldrake whom Beville thinks a mighty deal of was half as crazy about this yere ancient pile, he deserved some credit for risking the succession, and when the game was lost for throwing up the sponge and sailing to the new w7orld in a manly sort of way, without more ado and without clinging like a cat to the old haunt. There is one thing, Bev, my lad, you are barking up the wrong tree if you think I'll aid and abet you in your greed for the restoration of the old inheritance and the old honours, in the old country, in your person. I stood aside, my friend, and let you have the lady \u2014 not that I could have gone in and won, or so much as seriously clogged y7our wheels if I had tried my hardest.

I find the fair Elizabeth has her weak side like the rest of her kind, and I begin to doubt whether it would have fitted in with my weak side quite as well as I was once tempted to fancy. I can't go in with her willingness to get rid of a poor beggar whose worst faults are that he has been living in the clouds, and that he has not cut his wisdom teeth yet. But there is one thing I would have done for her, I would have protected her against herself \u2014 and you, my fool of a brother, are doing the very reverse.\" George flung away the end of the cigar he was smoking that he might give himself an angry shake, and stopped his pacing in solitude to and fro the much lauded terrace, where a broad border of periwinkles was beginning to show cold blue flowers, while the March dusk was deepening. George attacked Beville first. Beville had rather avoided his brother lately, but now George attached himself to his junior with a pertinacity which would not admit of his being shaken off. \" I want a word with y7ou, Obadiah,\" said George, as he walked the unwilling brother whom he caught in the porch down the avenue in the gathering darkness. \" What is this that is in the wind \u2014 this of setting aside the namesake of the 'immortal Williams ' who is camping out in his own camp ing ground ? \" At first Beville fenced with the question, aft'ected not to understand it, declared he knew next to nothing of their cousins \u2014 the Sheldrake family affairs. Mrs Sheldrake had said nothing to him, at the same time she had a right to do what she liked with her own."], [231, "The American Cousins 219 But George held his victim fast, aud brought him to the point at issue. \" You don't tree your self, young'un, with me looking on ; still less do you pull sheep's wool over my nose. Beville, I tell you plainly I don't like the turn matters are taking. It has an unhandsome \u2014 I had almost said a knavish smack about it. Willie Sheldrake has done nothing amiss that he should be required to resign his rights in your favour, and in that of your wife to be. The mother is labouring under an old-fashioned prejudice, and a fit of wounded pride and hurt feelings, but give her time, don't aid and abet her and she will get over it all, just as his nonsensical radicalism or socialism will die a natural death presently.\" \" You know nothing about it, George,\" said Beville, with a mixture of loftiness and testiness. \" Willie Sheldrake has done for himself by marry ing a girl beneath him, whom his family cannot be expected to know.\" \" He has done nothing of tbe kind,\" interrupted George, impatiently. \" He has married the daughter of a man as like our Uncle Moses as man can be, a genius in his way. Now, you know I have always reckoned Uncle Moses the trump card in our pack, worth all the Sheldrakes I have ever come across. What would we two Sheldrakes have done without him ? We might not have been gone coons exactly7, but we should have been just a pair of long descended southern planters as poor as Job, and as proud as Lucifer.

Upon my word I think j7ou and your delectable Elizabeth might think twice before you took it upon you to taboo such a sister-in-law, the summary tabooing un questionably detracting from the tabooer's delect ableness.\" \"Stop your destestable lingo,\" cried Beville, irritably ; \" you don't understand the differences in rank, birth and breeding which are too clearly defined in England to admit of a person's passing out of one class into another, without supreme discomfort to all concerned.\" \" Rot,\" protested George, contemptuously, \" you speak as if you were referring to the great gulf fixed between a Dives and a Lazarus. A fellow can see the necessity for it in that case, but in any other, good lack ! Besides there is a bridge, and that by7 no means of the most exalted kind, which has been spanning it across in every direction, as we Yanks and our money-bags have been made to know to our cost, for the last fifty years. Let my good friend Elias Whitelaw make the pile to which his mechanical genius entitles him, which he would certainly make in our half of the globe, and hey, presto ! he will have the sons, not only of Italian princes, French counts and German grafs, but of English marquises and earls at the feet of his sole remaining daughter \u2014 a very smart lass she is.\" \" All the nobility and gentry in England are not impecunious and given over to Mammon-worship and money-grubbing,\" said Beville, coldly. \" They would swallow the bicycles fast enough if the wheels were only sufficiently gilt,\" insisted George."], [233, "The American Cousins 221 \" You might as well say,\" continued Beville, \" that all Americans engage in a plunging trade and are ready to blow themselves out like the frog in the fable the one moment, and to ' bust up ' the next, just as it suits them \u2014 only your spread eagleism will not permit y7ou to be so unpatriotic.\" \" Hear the youngster having recourse to the metaphors of his mother-tongue ! \" declared George, with a provoking pretence of admiration. \" But you are begging the question, you sinner. When we came here you deliberately stated we had buried the hatchet of the past, old Humphrey Sheldrake's rusty hatchet. High time it was that the ugly useless thing should be safely hidden out of sight. I don't believe I ever heard it so much as mentioned till we arrived in this England \u2014 which you want to persuade me is real benighted medi\u00e6val and heathenish. Yet now in the teeth of centuries of oblivion and of your own words spoken not a year ago, you are prepared to profit by family dissensions and to oust a better man than yourself \u2014 for all his green folly \u2014 from the place he was born and reared to fill.\" \"He does not care a rap for the place,\" said Beville, sullenly. \" He has turned his back upon it and its obligations. He would rather have a hand in inventing one of his precious father-in-law's wretched little machines than in planting and build ing the land which has belonged to him and his for generations. I say nothing of shooting and riding to hounds, as you cannot fathom the attraction of English sport.\" Beville broke off with a laugh, half of amusement, half of reproach. \" You wished to go and see the meet, on your feet, in rubbers.\""], [234, "The American Cousins 222 \" Wall, I did,\" admitted George, philosophically. \" I didn't care to mount a horse whose acquaintance I had not the honour to possess, and these blessed lanes you are so fond of were about the mushiest attempts at roads I ever came across. I would have been right down silly7 not to have thought of pulling on rubbers. I ain't a howling Anglo- American swell like you. But about Mr William Sheldrake.\" \" He would sooner be the envy and butt of a workshop of mechanics, or the stump orator inflam ing an ignorant mob, or the rowdy ringleader of a regular beastly street riot than be a squire and gentleman on his own acres \u2014 a poor-law guardian, a churchwarden \u2014 a Justice of the Peace \u2014 it may be a member of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\" \" There is no accounting for tastes,\" said George, drily. \" I never had any great fancy for sitting down with my arms akimbo on my own land, or for legislating on the affairs of Virginny, or even for getting into Congress and having a shy at the Presidency. Guess I was too lazy a lubber for pitting the Democrats against the Republicans. I ain't sure, though, that I would be half a bad President. I would be real modest and reasonable. Congress and the States too would have a good time of it during my term of office, if somebody did not take it into his head to knock me on the head before I was fairly started. But Master William Sheldrake's nausea at his order and at the well-trodden path he is called on to follow is a complaint of youth, it isn't very uncommon, though I would not say exactly that it is catching.

It is a mad world, my masters, but anyhow, depend upon it our namesake's madness is in a fair wTay to being cured. You aren't going to demolish his last chance \u2014 the chance of a kinsman who gave you his hand in all good faith and fellowship on your first meeting.

It was a foretaste of the prob able sundering of that bond of brotherhood which in the absence of other kindred had been doubly strong between the pair. \" You can do as you like,\" said Beville, passion ately, \" but you are hard, considering all that I have at stake. \" I have considered,\" argued George, speaking more gently, \" but if she is not willing to leave the old house and the old people and go to the ends of"], [237, "The American Cousins 225 the earth with you, I tell you that you had better leave her alone.\" \" She is willing,\" and Beville threw up his head with a flush of proud confidence and devotion. \" She told me so the very day I asked her to be my wife ; but the wrench will be a cruel one \u2014 all the more cruel because her brother cares nothing for his birth-right and is ready to sell it to the first bidder.\" \" He cares nothing for it when he has it,\" said George, \" but buy it from him and you will hear a different story, for man is a contrary animal.\" \" She loves every stone of the place, and she may, for the setting is almost worthy of the jewel.\" \" If the jewel won't shine without the setting \u2014 as mind you is not my opinion, then it ain't what you \u2014 well, yes, and I have taken it for. But what ails you at the old home, lad, the White House in Virginny ?

His line \u2014 what ever cranky notion has diverted him from it, lies among those heavy bumpkins of farmers and louts of day-labourers, whose leases he has to renew, whose cottages he has to keep in decent repair, over whose clubs he has to preside.

She can no more extinguish the last and trample it under foot than I can put out a fire in the woods by gingerly beating it with half a dozen distracted feeble beaters. But it was not of Mrs Sheldrake and her sufferings I was thinking, it was of another woman made in a different mould, whose sensibilities are infinitely finer, and are keen with the keenness of youth. I might leave you to bail out your own boat, hard as the task may prove in the end \u2014 if it were not for her \u2014 Elizabeth. Beville, you are going the way to break her heart, to crush all that is truest and brightest in her nature, after you have sworn a hundred times that if it rested with you, she should be as happy as the day is long. She is unhappy already, she will never be happy again, if you and she persist in aiding and abetting wrong-doing and availing yourselves of it for your own ends. She is like her brother, she is labour ing more or less under a delusion at present\u2014 -her pride and her love have been both deeply wounded, and you and circumstances are tempting her to take her revenge on the brother who has failed her and his family. But she will wake up some day, and then she will never forgive herself \u2014 or you for having taken him at his word, and for having been the two to come forward and strip him of his inheritance.\" \" I cannot help that,\" said Beville, hoarsely. \" You may believe me or not, I have not tried to"], [242, "The American Cousins 230 influence her in her decision. I have hardly so much as hinted at it to her. It is her mother's cherished project, and it would be premature and indelicate, as I should hate to be, for me to meddle in it.

For the result we must take our chance.\" \" And you will not seek to bear her difficulties, to sympathise with her, to help her ? \" urged George. Beville shrugged his shoulders and was silent, and in silence the couple returned to the house. \" There goes a brother,\" said George bitterly to himself as he lingered a minute behind the other, \"and a woman is at the bottom of the mischief as usual.\" George addressed his next appeal without much hope of any good effect to Mary Sheldrake. She was flattered by his confidence, and she was further inclined to listen to him by her hardly concealed annoyance at the prospect of Elizabeth's being put before her. Yet the promotion was inevitable under the circumstances, and really existed in name rather than in fact, being con fined to the substitution of the landed property, on which Mary set no great store, for the hand some portion which was to be its equivalent. \" Nevertheless it is ridiculous of mother to think of Elizabeth's inheriting the estate \u2014 of course if anybody was to take Will's place, I as the eldest daughter ought to have been the person.

It would need a deal of money laid out in modern ising it. I don't care what Elizabeth and your brother say, I know they are constantly crying out that it should not be touched \u2014 as if it were a consecrated church which it would be sacrilege to restore without the bishop's authority.\" Mary was more easily stirred up by a rankling slight to herself than in her brother's interest. His sins and deficiencies bulked as largely in her eyes as in those of any other member of her family and acquaintances. She resented hotly the idea of having to acknowledge a Coringham bicycle man's daughter as her sister-in-law, and of consenting to receive her at Oakspur. It would be the same thing as admitting that she should some day reign as one of the heads of the house. George Sheldrake had a shrewd suspicion that Mary's opinion on the question varied a little according to the mood and company she was in. It was an opinion which was more plastic than Mary's views showed themselves to be generally. They were very pronounced as a rule, particularly on such subjects of discussion as the desirability of working girls wearing caps and not veils on the occasion of their confirmation. As it was, the solitary fruit of George's attempt to enlist Mary on his side was that, in her conver sations with Elizabeth just then, there leaped forth"], [244, "The American Cousins 232 a bungling, blustering assertion of their brother's claims and a doubt whether they could really be set aside unless on Mary's account and with her express consent and approval. Undaunted and difficult to defeat as George Sheldrake was in most instances in which he con sidered the compelling cause of duty to be in volved, he was put down by Mrs Sheldrake when he made attempts to probe her sentiments and sound her intentions. \"There are some topics which are too painful to be discussed, and my son is one of them, Mi- George,\" she said in her stiff, reticent way. \" As for my plans for my family \u2014 they are not fully matured, when they are being carried out I shall communicate with you \u2014 I take it for granted you speak in the name of your brother.\" \"No, no,\" George interrupted her hastily. \" Beville knows nothing of what I am doing.\" \" But he has every right to know what I pro pose to do before the question of settlements is entered upon.\" Mrs Sheldrake stuck to her point, while George deprecated speaking and acting for his brother, and so the discussion dropped. He had to grant that Mrs Sheldrake was unfortunately more than mistress of the situation, and that unless with Beville's warrant he, George, had no title to meddle farther in a vexatious business. If Oak spur were settled on Elizabeth Sheldrake and she became Beville's wife, their chief ties would be thenceforth to England, while George could not conceive that the mind of either of them was so constituted as to derive permanent satisfaction from"], [245, "The American Cousins 233 an inheritance which they had been the means of diverting from its natural course. There was one individual concerned whom George could not assail with remonstrances. When he would have attacked Elizabeth an intangible some thing held him back. He could not speak to her of the swift harsh retaliation which was threatened on her brother. It was like a wanton insult to her principles and affections. It was like attributing to her base personal motives, and accusing her of a lack of sisterly loyalty and regard. George had long ago relinquished every pretension to aproach Elizabeth as a lover. He had grown quite recon ciled to the relinquishment, which had been so speedy that the feelings he had repressed and stamped out had not touched the quick of the man's nature. He had even felt disappointed in her. But misled by family pride and ambition \u2014 almost vulgar he called them \u2014 and by the passionate love of which his brother was the object, showing herself liable to fail for a time, at least, as he reckoned, in the womanly tender qualities of family fidelity and devotion, she was still in a sense the \" her \" to him, still hedged about with a lingering divinity.

For the sake of the most fleeting of fancies which was yet his first fancy that had turned to love, he was dumb in her presence \u2014 she must not receive blame from him.

Beville and Elizabeth were blinded by what had been at first a not ignoble, if extravagant venera tion for their ancestral past. But their delight in it had grown into a wrathful covetousness, an arrogant consuming craving to possess what they7 believed they alone knew how to prize at its proper value, and to cherish as an ancient honour and glory ought to be cherished. Mary was more in her ordinary frame of mind, but she was always entirely occupied with her daily round, her obligations as one of the Oak spur young ladies, the eldest daughter of the house, and her parochial duties. These were simply jumbled up and complicated by her sense of an impending family crisis in which she was not to play the first part, as she felt she ought to have done. She was therefore slightly suspicious and resentful especially when George Sheldrake, the elder brother of the bridegroom and squire-elect of Oakspur, as Mary was the elder sister of the future bride and squiress did not hesitate to inveigh against the measure. \u00a9 Dorothy and Eleanor did not require the percep tion that something unexplained and unexpected"], [248, "236 The American Cousins was in the wind. They were sufficiently alert and inventive while the anticipated quarrel between Elizabeth and Beville with its tragic conclusion possessed them and kept them constantly on the qui vive. Over at Coringham Elias Whitelaw had packed off Willie Sheldrake on a business errand to America. Elias had no great confidence in his deputy, but he felt compelled as the best thing to do for everybody, and for the sake of his own peace of mind, to get his objectionable son-in-law out of the way for a few weeks or months. It would keep him out of people's sight till the scandal of his indiscretions and of his rescue only7 by the skin of his teeth had died a natural death. And Gussy, good little Gussy, was disinterestedly, wistfully glad that Willie in his mortification and depression at the collapse of his high-flying schemes should have a change of scenery and company. It did not matter that she herself drooped and pined without him, like a flower deprived of air and sunlight, or that her own heart was fit to break because his generous efforts and sacrifices had been a failure, because her Peter the Great was neither understood nor appreciated by the fellow men he had sought to serve. Then a slight thing \u2014 as it might have appeared to the uninitiated \u2014 happened, overthrowing every body's calculations and confounding their plans. Mrs Sheldrake had a passing illness. True it be gan in an alarming manner. The poor lady was found insensible in her room by one of the maid servants to the consternation of the elder daughters called to their mother's aid. But the insensibility"], [249, "The American Cousins 237 only lasted a short time, and the doctor, hastily summoned by the terrified girls, assured them that all present danger was past. He said that with proper care the little attack might not recur, might be warded off for a period of years. \" Wffat a fuss to make about, nothing,\" insisted Dorothy and Eleanor, who knew no better. Yet they were vaguely startled by the pale dread and remorse dimly visible in the faces around them, whenever these were relieved from the necessity of composing themselves and playing a part so as not to alarm the person principally concerned. \" What was everybody pulling long faces for ? Even cousin George looked blue the moment mother went out of the room. Of course she had been ill, but wasn't she up and about again in a couple of days ? Didn't the doctor call it \" a little attack,\" and say if she would attend to the pre scribed regimen, whatever that might mean, keep herself cheerful and not let anything weigh on her mind, she would be all right. Elizabeth's marriage, to which mother had given her consent ages ago, was not such a thing, and the doctor's advice was a good reason for everybody's being cheerful. What babies the grown-ups were to look for marvels, miracles. Mother had been ill, nobody doubted that, she had fainted the other morning and she had not been brought round quickly \u2014 very likely because Dorothy and Eleanor were not sent for to soak her handkerchief in eau-de-cologne or toilet vinegar and lay it on her forehead and get her to swallow \u2014 the instant she threw off the faint ness \u2014 half a teaspoonful of sal volatile in a glass of water. That was what Fraulein Stock did to them"], [250, "238 The American Cousins when they had overwalked themselves, or played too long at lawn tennis. It was not at all remarkable that mother should not walk so well as usual, first when she got up. Why, when they had measles, they quite tottered, when they rose out of bed, and could hardly cross the room without help. They supposed it was also from weakness that mother talked rather funnily. They did not remember talking funnily, but very likely they did, though they were not aware of it. Oh ! and they recollected that little Jack Underhill after he had diphtheria could not say anything which was intelligible for days and days. \" Go to the schoolroom to Fraulein Stock,\" was all the answer the bewildered girls received, \"and mind when you are at lunch, or in the drawing room, don't plague mother by hanging about her, and asking her questions.\" \" As if we were not old enough to know how to behave ourselves ! \" the girls told each other indignantly, \" and as if we are not certain that mother expects us to inquire after her colds and is hurt when we forget all about them ! \" If sleep is death's twin-brother, there is a malady to which the body is liable that produces a con dition still liker death, still more closely allied to the shadow feared by man than healthful sleep can ever be. It too resembles sleep in many respects, and its advance is often as stealthy and gradual. It is a touch \u2014 a sensation \u2014 an oblivion, an awakening, but even when its fluttering wings have merely hovered over and lightly brushed its victims, the unwelcome visitor rarely departs with out leaving a trace, which, however slight, is in-"], [251, "The American Cousins 239 delible of his visit, a token that he has been there and will come again at the appointed time, it may be soon, or it may be late, the cases when he fails to reappear are so exceptional that they hardly count. This common disease of middle life and old age, which attacks high and low indiscrimin ately, has been well defined in the graphic figures of speech of simple people, which mother- wit originates, and use and wont preserves for genera tions. The disease is familiarly referred to, some times as \" a stroke\" sometimes as \" a shock,\" \u2014 so it is, a stroke from an unseen icy hand, benumbing the vital powers with the lingering chill never altogether withdrawn, a shock arresting the wheel at the cistern, bidding all the machinery stand still for a second, and when it resumes its operations causing it to do so with a languor scarcely perceptible to begin with, but increasing by strides, with every successive shock, till the order for the final stoppage is issued. Mrs Sheldrake had suffered from a slight attack of paralysis. She was not ill to speak of in the course of a few hours. Her senses were unim paired, her appetite was as good, her natural robustness, so far as one could see, as unshaken as ever. Her mind was a good deal dazed as well as perturbed, but that was more the effect of the grave tidings which had come to her, than the source of the tidings. Literally the only clear evidence which remained that the shadow had been there was the slight dragging of one foot as she walked \u2014 which lent a certain uncertainty and feebleness to her former steady bearing and firm tread \u2014 the slight faltering of the tongue which had"], [252, "The American Cousins 240 always spoken slowly and with a measured utter ance. It now declined to move in perfect response to the will of the speaker and delivered its message with a thickened laborious articulation. It was the very fact of this present well-being, this present immunity from suffering and danger, which lent a strange sense of unreality and at the same time a peculiar haunting sadness to the posi tion for Mrs Sheldrake and those around her. All of them, with the exception of the two inexperi enced young girls, knew that in human probability she would never be quite the same in body and mind as she had been before her illness, she would go on, failing more or less gradually7, till the ultimate collapse. She and her family had been in full life with all its interests round them, speaking to them in loud imperative accents, usurping their regard. Now the little group were in the shadow of death. The tremendous uncertainty of life was brought forcibly home to them. There would be a skeleton thenceforth at their feasts, dumbly presiding over the most enjoyable episode. The sentence had gone forth \u2014 its execution might be indefinitely delayed, but it would not \u2014 unless that happened which did not occur to one in a thousand \u2014 be reversed. The vividness of the impression of what had come to pass would wear off presently, even to Mrs Sheldrake, that is, if she did not succumb ere long to the enemy in her camp. There was much the same uncertainty, though in a less degree, with regard to the repetition of the attack to which she had been subjected, as prevails in connection with the end, in any form, of our mortal life. W7e all know we shall die"], [253, "Tlie American Cousins 241 sometime, but the merciful ignorance in which we are kept with regard to the how, the when and the where, acts at once as a stimulant and as a sedative, and prevents us from brooding morbidly over what is inevitable and therefore \u2014 under the reign of the All- wise, the All-good beneficial. Mrs Sheldrake had simply gone a step farther than a large proportion of her neighbours. She could tell what in all probability would loosen the silver cord which bound her to life in this world. But even that was doubtful. There was a fraction of possibility that she might outwit her foe, even as his worst assault might be deferred till her three score years and ten were accomplished. Some one of the many other diseases abounding in the world, some example of the violent accidents which happen at intervals in human history, might interpose and cheat the enemy of his prey. There was a curious comfort to be found in the suggestion of these casualities. Besides, Mrs Sheldrake was a good woman according to her lights. In Coringham, people might call her the essence of worldly -mindedness and heartlessness, a cruel, unnatural mother, but that was because Coringham knew no better. She believed she was fulfilling her dead husband's wishes, and doing her duty by her daughters \u2014 by the Sheldrake family \u2014 by society in high places, in taking her son at his word, or rather at his act. Although he had grievously disappointed and wounded her, she was striving anxiously to give him a fitting compensation for the family honours he was ready to relinquish. Such a woman can resign herself to what she sees to be the will of Q"], [254, "The American Cousins 242 God without much difficulty, in decent reverence and unaffected devoutness. Indeed, with one signal reservation, familiarity with the state of matters was doing its usual work in calming the vehemence of the apprehen sion and dulling the keenness of the sorrow which had been the accompaniments of the visitation to Oakspur that April morning, when buds were bursting and birds singing on all sides. For Mrs Sheldrake had her proper place and her due influ ence. She might be dense and narrow minded, unsympathetic towards aspirations she could not compass, but she had been a good wife and she was a good mother. Perhaps, if she had been less so, Willie Sheldrake would have been less reckless in carrying out his vagrant ideas. The hearts of her children trusted in her. They were accustomed to look up to her as having been since their father's death the natural ruling power and authority in the house, to which they could all turn, on which they could all rely. Her very limitations seemed to render her more stable and trustworthy as a stay. The mere threat of the removal of the stay was like the suggestion of the removal of the main and central pillar on which the whole building rested. Even the elder girls, Mary and Elizabeth, had been too young when their father died to recall him clearly or miss him greatly. He had been an easy-going man of the world, whose engagements and amusements had taken him a good deal from home, but their mother had always been in her house-mother's place in the midst of them. The very thought of her being taken away from them, after Willie had"], [255, "The American Cousins 243 forsaken them, had a ring of desolation in it. A poor little family of forlorn orphan girls \u2014 what was to become of them ? But the first stunning note of alarm and trouble to come was subsiding. Mary was getting easy in her mind about her mother already. She was determinedly satisfied and hopeful. She had been over at the vicarage at the clearing up of the yearly accounts of the clothing club. She was able to go and come from church without her heart any longer palpitating wildly, because of what she might find at home before her. The American cousins, though they had been as full of regret, and as helpful as young men could possibly be, when their hostess's illness was fresh, had, as might have been expected, grown rapidly reconciled to what was not their concern \u2014 unless in as far as it distressed Elizabeth, and through Elizabeth touched Beville. George had ceased to look as if he could have said, \"I told you what you would do. You submitted to the poor woman's being egged on. You as good as signified that y7ou would aid and abet her by agreeing to furnish her with the means for carrying out her rash intention, and here is the result.\" Beville ceased to seek, with covert eagerness, to ascertain how soon Mrs Sheldrake would be able to go up to London again to transact business \u2014 important business \u2014 which could not be long put off, though of its agitating nature he was afraid there would not be two opinions. The necessity could only arise from her not having concluded all her business with her lawyer the last time she was in town. True, he might easily come down to"], [256, "The American Cousins 244 Oakspur at any time, or he could forward to her such documents as she might still have to sign; but she had always appeared to prefer to go up to town and transact her business, closeted with the head of her firm of solicitors in his private room. She was a silent, still woman, who liked to go her own way without observation, and hated to provoke the discussion to which the visit of her lawyer to Oakspur at such a time would be certain to give rise. Beville hated himself the moment after he had made the calculation, and he could see that George detected him in it, and turned away in pain and displeasure. The culprit could only trust with all his heart that his fellow-sinner Elizabeth, whose passionate penitence he had reason to dread, would not be aware of his first thought. Elizabeth Sheldrake was very miserable with a self-accusing, remorseful misery which she could not shake off, even when her earlier fears for her mother were quieted. At the moment when she and Mary had been fetched to their mother, Elizabeth had been really the calmer and more helpful of the two ; but when the urgent need for self-control was over, and the reaction came, the whole earth seemed to give way under her. She was plunged into an abyss of wretchedness and self-abasement, such as Mary's stolid, self complacent temperament could never fathom. Had she \u2014 Elizabeth \u2014 done anything to bring about this sore calamity, this peril to her mother, this loss to all the family ? When the Angel of Death had been drawing near to them had she been blind to his vicinity because she was full of her resentment against her brother and her dreams"], [257, "The American Cousins 245 of worldly advancement for her and her cousin Beville at Willie's expense ? Mary had not been clearer sighted, but she had been less bitter against Willie of late. She had made some remarks which had shown that she had been thinking of his interests and feelings, and had been doubtful whether proper respect were paid to them by a deed of transfer, which should, even with his consent, put his sister and her husband in his rightful place. And it was not Mary who had been Willie's favourite sister and friend, it was Elizabeth. And she had failed him at the first sign of his contumaciousness. She had been willing to profit by his folly. She had failed Willie, as Willie had failed his mother and the rest of them and that in a more selfish manner. She had been accustomed to think, not very respectfully, of Mary's capacity and tastes and of the time which she spent with their maid Maria over their dress making and parish work. Elizabeth had considered half reluctantly, half comically, that the intellect of the mistress and maid was much on the same level. But now, at the first panic \u2014 when the sisters were summoned to see their mother lying back in her chair with glassy unseeing eyes, and heavy unconscious breathing \u2014 Mary flung herself into a chair, covering her face and sobbing. Then Elizabeth, pale as death herself and trembling all over, instinctively pulled herself together, took the lead, assisted in undressing her mother and laying her on a couch, sponged her face and hands, saw that she had air, wrote the note and despatched the groom post-haste for the doctor \u2014 Elizabeth did all that. But presently, when Mrs Sheldrake's con-"], [258, "246 77/i? American Cousins sciousness was restored and things had outwardly returned to their normal condition, Mary, with Maria to back her, was more at home and more use ful in the circumstances. It was quite simple and natural for Mary to resume her superintendence of the cutting out and basting of the clothes for the club, while she accompanied the performance with a running fire of commentaries and explanations. How inferior this flannel was, and how superior that calico ! How old widow Jenkins was to get this petticoat and little Tommy Parks, the blind letter-carrier's son, that night-dress. Mrs Shel drake was more interested in these and similar communications, the like of which she had heard hundreds of times, than with any wistful effort on Elizabeth's part to divert her mind and amuse her. Elizabeth forgot for the time how far Mrs Sheldrake's character and Mary's were cast in the same mould. How many subjects and opinions they had held in common while the mother was still robust and active for her years. On the contrary there had been comparatively few points of contact between Mrs Sheldrake and Elizabeth ; and of late years they had seen comparatively little of each other, except at meal times, and in the drawing room of an evening. It was not wonderful, therefore, that Elizabeth's frequent presence should tend rather to disturb than to soothe her mother ; that it should render her uneasy because of its unaccustomedness ; and that it should vex her by constantly reminding her of the subtle change in herself which had changed 0 \u00a9 all the world to her, since the April morning when"], [259, "The American Cousins 247 the whole keynote of her being and doing was altered in an instant. \"Go back, my dear, to your papers,\" Mrs Shel drake would tell Elizabeth earnestly. \"Why are you doing so little to them ? I thought you were making a regular work of collecting and annotat ing them so that they might be put away in perfect order. This is the task you have under taken and you ought not to tire of what you have fairly entered upon \u2014 you should always finish what you've begun. It is a bad lesson to let yourself learn to break down without sufficient reason, in the middle of a task, and it is a bad example to set before y7our younger sisters. Read to me ? Thanks, child, but,\" a little testily, \" I can read to myself still, I am thankful to say. You know I do not care for light reading, and my head is still too weak for anything solid.\" Elizabeth would not have minded being dis missed, if it had not been for the stab of knowing that she was not wanted, that she had let her eager pursuits come between her and her mother. Mary had been unwittingly more loyal, since nothing had carried her a-field where Mrs Sheldrake could not follow. The mother and daughter in this case were used to each other, were intimately acquainted in the sense of their full familiarity with a multi tude of details which were strange to Elizabeth. She was left out in the cold with an aching con viction that her poor hobbies in genealogy and antiquarianism and remote family history with which her mother had never found fault, had nevertheless served to separate the two. And oh ! to think she had let her mother go in order to"], [260, "248 The American Cousins gratify a conceited, pedantic fancy, an idle whim. In the indulgence of it she had imagined her self superior to people who were a great deal more useful to their day and generation, who had not turned away from their nearest friends in the common round of household duties and pleasures \u2014 whose friends in their need would miss them and crave for them. It was the same miserable hobbies\u2014 affectations she felt inclined to call them now, which had rendered her doubly bitter against Willie under his delusion. They had prevented her from taking any step after the first of his strayings, which would have been permissible to a sister on the terms that had existed between them formerly, to interfere, persuade, entreat, implore and finally win him from his wild theories. She had called the passive attitude she had assumed proper pride and integrity in not seeking to tamper with his free will and independent action. She suspected now it might have been a lurking prevision of what was to come \u2014 a greed for that possession of Willie's which she prized the most and he the least. She had been heedless of her natural obli gation to protect Willie, to defend him against himself. Nay, she had been false to Willie and through Willie to their mother whom, if she, Elizabeth, had saved her brother from the last excesses of his socialism and brought back to his first allegiance, she would have spared the misery of a struggle which had gone far to kill Mrs Sheldrake. Elizabeth had also tempted and misled Beville Sheldrake, she could not look him in the face in the humiliation of being forced to see all the"], [261, "The American Cousins 249 evil she had done and had been willing to do. She sickened at the recollection of how she had taught herself to look upon the pair as the future master and mistress of Oakspur, the true successors of Sir Beville \u2014 stretched for centuries by his Dame Cordel on their alabaster couch a spectacle to men in Stratford church. She shrank unconquerably from her lover, she felt as if she had deceived and disgraced him and that they must part never to meet again. It wau hard lines for poor Beville \u2014 bewildered, aggrieved, hurt in the tenderest quarter. He was not allowed to come near Elizabeth, to stay by her, to comfort and encourage her, as it was his privi lege to do. He was ruthlessly repulsed by her, he saw her sedulously avoid him \u2014 nay, he was con scious that when her eye fell upon him she turned away hastily in an agony of self-reproach and despair. George was sorry for his brother, though he could not deny that Beville had done something to deserve his punishment. The elder brother gave the younger excellent advice. \" Let her alone. Let her come to herself. Don't hurry up your cakes. Don't go into a blue funk on the spot. The poor girl \u2014 she is but a girl, not a goddess of wisdom, or an angel of light \u2014 is thoroughly7 upset, and I like her the better for it. Her whole views of life have undergone a transformation. Don't you remember what an old Hebrew prophet said of a woman whose mind was in a chaos of grief and pain, who could not tell what she wanted or how she felt. ' Let her alone. Her soul is vexed within her.' Let Elizabeth"], [262, "The American Cousins 250 alone, lad, and she will speak of her own accord, and make it up when the time comes.\" Accordingly, the same night that George, unable to look longer at Beville hanging his head ruefully and eating that least toothsome of morsels \u2014 his own heart \u2014 administered to him the sound counsel just quoted, Elizabeth stole up to her lover, stand ing moodily drumming with his fingers on a pane of the oriel window in the April dusk. The two had been little alone together recently, and, ac cording to all the laws promulgated for Edwin and Angelina, ought to have seized the first opportunity to fly together with the rapidity and certainty of chemical affinities. And the womanly heart had relented at the sorrowful listlessness of the figure and attitude of the man, who was not raging in a whirlwind of love and anger, only bowing his head and suffering. \" Am I hard to you, too, Beville ? I am harder to myself, if you knew it. But I owe you repara tion, for I have wronged you, dear. No, don't speak and contradict me. I have wronged you deeply. I have put things into your head, and led you to dream dreams which never would have come there, never would have existed, if I had barred the door against them, instead of paving the way for them. But if you can bear to give them up, if you care to have me alone when mother is as well \u2014 no, not as well as ever, as well as she can be now, poor, poor dear mother \u2014 and when Willie has come back to fill his own place, I will go with you wherever you choose, across the Atlantic to the house in which George and you were born, to the Rocky Mountains, or the"], [263, "The American Cousins 251 Alleghanies, or California, or the Hudson's Bay Settlements, I don't care which if you are there, and if I am away from England, and Warwick shire, and Oakspur \u2014 not the persons, the places I have been so foolishly fond of. I should be glad, Beville, to leave them behind me if I could only get rid of the associations with which they are connected. I feel as if I should never care to see old monuments and pictures, or parchment charters and faded yellow letters again.\" \" Well, my darling,\" said Beville, clasping her hands, \"you are not likely to be troubled with them where you propose to go.\" He spoke with a laugh which was perfectly honest, though it was considerably forced and embarrassed, but in the laugh he looked the lad who was younger than Elizabeth in mind and character, who had been restive under his brother's control, but whom this woman whom he loved might lead with a silken thread. \" All that I wish to say for myself is that if I have cared for the things which you cared for more than I was justified in doing, it was partly for your sake, and I cared for you first and foremost \u2014 infinitely the foremost. I would rather have you than all the Oakspurs in Europe. And if you are content with me, and if we atone for breaking the Tenth Commandment by renouncing, as far as lies in our power, any chance of getting what we coveted, we will still be happy together, you and I, Because we love each other in God's sight, as the man should love the woman and the woman the man who are about to be husband and wife, a world before house and land, rank and wealth, and gentle"], [264, "The American Cousins 252 breeding \u2014 before everything in existence except virtue and Heaven.\" It was the voice of Elizabeth in her right mind which was speaking now through Beville. Let her take heed, in time to come, that the voice which thus spoke through him was a voice which good men and the angels that minister to them could approve of."], [265, "253 CHAPTER XVII \"THE ONLY SON OF HIS MOTHER, AND SHE WAS A WIDOW\" One of the first things which Elizabeth had done after her mother's seizure was to write to Willie and summon him to Oakspur. It was a letter irrespective of all that had gone before, overlook ing it, ignoring it, saying simply, \"Mother is ill. Come home, Willie.\" Elizabeth did not know that her brother was in America when she wrote. But it would not have signified if she had known, unless that the know ledge might have added to her dismay and distress an almost distracting terror lest he should arrive too late. For, of course, the letter would reach him eventually, and equally of course he would obey its summons. The Sheldrakes had not been so united a family in views and tastes as some fortunate families can boast themselves, but till Willie had gone off at a tangent, putting his socialistic dreams into practice, there had never been anything like a rupture be tween the members. It still sounded utterly un natural that there should be even the dawning of a great change and loss at Oakspur and Willie not"], [266, "The American Cousins 254 to be apprised of it \u2014 that his mother should be stricken with the first stroke of an illness, mortal in its character, and her son \u2014 her only son \u2014 should not be there to comfort and support her. With all the great unlikeness between Willie Sheldrake and his mother, there had been in their intercourse something which was absent in the mother's intercourse with her daughters. It was not merely because Willie had been, to begin with, looked upon by her and by everybody else, as her natural successor in power and place \u2014 the future unrestricted master and ruler of Oakspur, and the guardian of his sisters' interests, there was another influence at work. This was the comple mentary relationship between men and women which causes their natures and lives to fit into each other (the one supplying what the other lacks) in the connection of man and wife, mother and son, brother and sister, in a peculiar fashion which is not found in other ties, however close and tender. Mrs Sheldrake treated her daughters as born Sheldrakes, with unusual consideration, but so long as her son kept within bounds, whatever concerned him was a matter of paramount im portance in her eyes, to which everything else must yield. She was one of these conservative women, somewhat out of date, to whom de ference to men is an absolute instinct, not to be questioned without wild insubordination and posi tive anarchy. No emancipation of women, no revolt of daughters, could shake her rooted convictions on this head. She had looked up to her husband, who, besides being her superior in rank, had been"], [267, "The American Cousins 255 considerably her senior in age. She would have looked up to Willie if he would have let her, yet Willie had been a baby in her arms, a little boy trotting by her side only the other day, and though he had shot up into a man with a man's wilfulness, he was still her baby and boy of the past. Baby or boy or young man, nevertheless she did not forget that he was his father's representative. She had consulted him more than he cared to be consulted on such questions as she laid before him. She had deferred to his judgment till recently, with a deference which she did not vouchsafe even to her ally Mary. Willie, on his side, was a man and a gentleman at heart in his vagaries. His mother was his mother and a widow to boot. He did not at all agree with her in her old-fashioned, cramped ideas, and he could not make her understand him in the least. But till their final violent quarrel and the break-off of all intercourse between them on his announcement of his engagement to Gussy White law, he had shown her more forbearance than could have been reasonably expected from a man of his temperament \u2014 an idealist, impulsive, vehement and reckless. Just as he had slowed his pace when he walked with her, and his arm had always been at her service if she chose to avail herself of it, so he had lent an ear to her formal platitudes and solemn nothings, and had not been betrayed into an exhibition of his weariness. Yes, that was part of the torture of what Mrs Sheldrake was about to do, that her son, until he was ensnared and carried away by his revolu-"], [268, "The American Cousins 256 tionary madness, and until he had been vulgarly taken in by these Whitelaws, had been anything rather than a bad son to her. Indeed Lady Thorndale had often complimented Mrs Shel drake on what her ladyship was pleased to call her friend W7illie's respectfulness and his considera tion shown to his seniors in general and to his mother in particular. It was in such marked con trast to the rude and flippant \u2014 even when it stopped short of being the insolent \u2014 and undutiful spirit of the age. Alas ! that was all over. Willie had left his mother and disgraced himself and his family. There was nothing left for her, in mercy to the misguided lad himself, in order that he might not have Oakspur in his power to waste and drag down to the lowest level, save to take him at his word. She must disinherit him, bestow bis best things upon others, and let him be no more seen in the region he had of his own free will abandoned. It was difficult to know clearly what Mrs Sheldrake intended to do, quite as difficult sub sequent to her illness as before it. She never mentioned her son, she never expressed a wish that he should be sent for, though for all that her family could ascertain she was not aware that he had sailed to America. They were ignorant of that visit of hers to the disused nurseries, or of that slow thick speaking of his name to be heard by herself and her God alone, in the silent watches of the night. The family dared not approach Mrs Sheldrake on the subject which was present in their minds, though it was a momentous question, and though"], [269, "The American Cousins 257 available time might be passing which could never be recalled. In her respect for her daughters, she had somehow managed to iuspire them, including even Mary in a degree, with an unswerving respect for her which forbade all liberties on their part. Mother and daughters had lived together in a harmony which was a little distant and was never familiar. Mary who was the elder and by far the more intimate with her mother, of the two grown up daughters, who was also thick-skinned and not alive to silent rebuke whatever she might be to outspoken rebuff, did not care to interfere now that affairs had taken another turn. She had been greatly astonished aud again a little affronted, when she had gone up to Elizabeth's room on the afternoon of the day on which their mother wras taken ill, and learnt that Elizabeth had written for Willie. \" What on earth did you do that for ? You might have safely left it to me. What good will it do ? \" cried Mary, still panting from the ascent of the old-fashioned stair, and look ing at her sister with round, bewildered eyes, her high colour getting still higher in her as tonishment and sense of offence. \" It will only agitate mother, and you know the doctor has warned us against agitating her. W7hy did you not tell me before you wrote ? Do you mean Will to say in so many words, in everybody's hearing, that he will give up Oakspur for an equivalent in money ? How could you think of such a thing at such a time, when mother has had to be bled, and I can hardly tell a word she says ? If Beville told you to do it, it was very bad of him. I wonder R"], [270, "The American Cousins 258 you listened to him. I must say, Elizabeth, that it strikes me as very ill-judged and unkind of you, since you must know how painful it will be to everyone, and how it will put mother about. Though she will keep her disturbance to herself, there is the danger.\" \"Oh, no, Mary,\" protested Elizabeth, shrinking back as she might have done from a blow aimed at her. \" How could you believe that of me ? What does it matter about Oakspur or any other place when poor mother is as she is. Willie may keep Oakspur \u2014 I am sure I hope he will, nobody wants it from him if he will only stay here and do his duty.\" It was Mary's turn to be taken aback and non plussed. She would have cried, \" Good gracious, Elizabeth, are you in earnest ? This is a change of the wind with a vengeance. What will Beville say to it ? \" but she had not entirely recovered from the shock of the morning ; she was still com paratively subdued and shaken. She only said further in a puzzled voice, \" Has cousin George been talking to you ? \" \" Not a word,\" answered Elizabeth, shaking her head and speaking with sad ruefulness ; \" but can't you see I must have found it out for myrself in the space of a moment ? Oh ! dear, I hope it will not be too awful a lesson, fit to crush me for the rest of my life. How little worth any earthly good is in the Presence we were brought face to face with this morning. Mary, you are glad, thankful mother is better, and so would Dorothy and Eleanor be if they understood she had been in danger; but you can none of you conceive what"], [271, "The American Cousins 259 my thankfulness is like, or what I should have thought or done if,\" her voice sinking and quiver ing with fear, \" she had died then.\" \" I wish you would not say such horrid things, Elizabeth,\" remonstrated Mary almost petulantly, for with all her matter-of-factness she hated to face unpleasant truths. \" It is enough that mother has not died, and that with proper care the doctor says she may live for years and years, perhaps as long as any of us. How do we know that we are to be long-livers ? \" she finished triumphantly, as if the doubt were a strong point in their mother's favour. \" We don't know, of course,\" said Elizabeth, \" but only yesterday \u2014 no farther back \u2014 mother was immortal,\" and a faint, wistful smile passed over her face. \" Immortal ! Of course she is immortal,\" ex claimed Mary, indignantly ; \" no Christian doubts it, but I was not speaking of her immortality, I was thinking of the term of her natural life.\" \" Of her mortality, which we had forgotten till this morning when it was brought promi nently before us. Yes, certainly we may any of us die any day, yet the sword of Damocles is not suspended visibly over our heads.\" \" Oh ! bother Damocles,\" cried Mary, im patiently, \" never mind him. But why should you bring Will here ? I am sure we have enough to think of without having Will on our hands, and she \u2014 the girl, his wife \u2014 will come next. Who will be able to stop her ? I wish, Elizabeth, you had thought what you were bringing upon us when we do not even need a"], [272, "The American Cousins 260 man to appeal to and to advise us, so long as our cousins are staying in the house, and Beville engaged to you to boot; whereas, if Will comes, it will excite mother, throw her back, and very likely do her a serious injury. Besides, I really think y7ou ought to have paid mother the small compliment of waiting till she was able to listen and then asking her what she wished, before you took it upon you to bring Will over. You have not begun to set her aside already, I hope.\" \" Mary ! \" was all Elizabeth could get out in a gasp of deprecation, knowing all the time that her sister had only the dimmest suspicion of the pain she was inflicting. \" Don't let us quarrel,\" said Mary7, with the magnanimity7 of a very superior person, sitting down in the chair by which she had been stand ing. \" I know this is not a time to quarrel, but yrou are always so wrong-headed and wilful, so carried away by any fancy you have got into your head.\" \" Am I ? \" inquired Elizabeth, too broken down for the moment to defend herself. The next moment she faced round on Mary, \" I dared not, Mary, I dared not refrain from sending for Willie. I could not wait till I had spoken to her. What would it signify though he had married a beggar and herded with beggars, or though he had killed a man in a street riot \u2014 that would not alter the fact that he is her son \u2014 her only son, whom she used to think much of and be proud of, don't you remember though she said so little about it ? \" \" If I she said so little about it how could I"], [273, "The American Cousins 261 tell ? \" was Mary's ungracious response. \" I have always thought mother was quite fair to us all, and rather like me ; but I suppose she did care a good deal for Will at one time, if you will have it so, all the more, the sight of him may \u2014 \" \" Oh ! Mary, don't say kill her,\" implored Elizabeth, \" we will take the greatest care. He will not see her till she is prepared for the meeting and has consented to it. But even if it did kill her, our own mother,\" went on Elizabeth, with blanched cheeks, and a panting breast, \" I dared not keep him in ignorance, I dared not keep him away after what has passed. I don't know what she has done, I don't know what may happen, but Willie must come here and make his peace with his mother before it is too late.\" \" Then you must take the responsibility,\" said Mary, rising and kicking out her skirt, as if she thus dismissed her share of the burden. \" I daresay you did not mean any harm, and I am sure, I trust, you have done none. I do not see that you and Beville will be the gainers but rather the losers by this rash proceeding on your part. I shall be much surprised if even the person to profit by it will thank you for it. However, don't blame me. Have it your own way \u2014 you always have. A notion gets hold of you and you cannot let it go. There, I must go and see if mother is still asleep. I think she must be, for Maria was to let me know as soon as she awoke.\" Mrs Sheldrake did not die. She very soon shook off the little dizziness and disorder, the"], [274, "The American Cousins 262 weakness which had followed on the heels of her little attack. At a cursory glance she looked as far from death as most of her neigh bours, a large, florid, vigorous-seeming woman, and yet there was a change \u2014 almost intangible, unless to a close observer, but not the less real, not the less hauntingly impressive to those who had eyes for it.\" Mary thought her mother had quite got over her attack, which had been treated in time. Dorothy and Eleanor would not believe there had been anything to speak of the matter with \" mother.\" Even Beville was deceived and could not understand why Elizabeth, when she did not put a restraint on herself in her mother's pre sence, was depressed and nervous, and clearly fretting herself unnecessarily7. Only George, who had always been rational and decorous in his tone to the formal middle aged mistress of the house and had spoken passable English to her, was still more con siderate of her feelings and prejudices. (Beville declared George's English became impeccable under the obligation.) He was yet more desirous of being unobtrusively of use to her as their different ages and sexes in his opinion not merely warranted but enjoined. The change in Mrs Sheldrake was not so much in the hardly perceptible drag of the foot, sub duing her gait, in the occasional trip of the slow tongue and the trifle of glassiness reflected from eyes, which, like Mary's eyes, had been accused by critics of always containing a certain stoni-"], [275, "The American Cousins 263 ness in their depths. The change was in the whole woman, inward as well as outward, not simply in shades of her aspect. Yet she was not out of spirits \u2014 that is, her spirits were as equal and level as ever. She showed no ten dency to break down or get agitated ; she was not duller than before. But she developed a rooted disinclination to pay visits, and that after her normal strength had come back, or to go abroad except for her daily drive, which she deliberately shortened from this date. She made no plans. If she talked of doing any thing even in the near future, she was care ful to qualify the statement \" If I can,\" \" If it is in my power,\" she would say in parentheses. Once she made Elizabeth's heart quail and sink fathoms by adding quickly after she had re ferred to something which she was likely to do in the following y7ear, \" That is, if I am still here.\" Elizabeth knew very well the reserva tion had nothing to do with any chance of her mother's being replaced in the meantime by Willie and his wife. It was clear that Mrs Shel drake had fully accepted the situation with its special risks and uncertainties, and that they were constantly present with her while she waited for her summons. Whatever business she had on her shoulders she was bent on accomplishing with as much promptitude as possible. She acquired the habits of the aged \u2014 ten, twenty years her senior, to whom time seems to grow continually more precious as its sands are manifestly sinking under their wistful eyes. Always a punctual"], [276, "264 77-6- American Cousins woman she began now to anticipate time and positively to waste it in her determination not to be late in keeping her engagements. Mary, herself a model of exactness, was fretted by her mother's growing mania for being before time in all she undertook. Mrs Sheldrake com menced to look at her watch continually, she had come to doubt the evidence of her neigh bours, and was convinced the whole world had combined to lag in order to throw her out in her calculations. \" Mother, cook is right ; you would not have the dressing-bell rung a quarter of an hour too soon and the dinner sent up half-cooked ? \" re monstrated Mary. \" No, the afternoon post was not behind time. It is only you who are weary ing. We must get a book you will like better, from Mudie's \u2014 Elizabeth will see to that, and I'll find you some work more entertaining than your knitting. Do you think you would care to look through the old greenhouse, which is quite at hand ; you would only need to throw a nice wool shawl over your cap to guard against draughts, and see the spring flowers which are remark ably fine this year? Do, mother, it would serve to divert you and pass away the time.\" But the proposed book, work and stroll were alike ineffectual iu answering the purpose they were meant to serve. Indeed, Mrs Sheldrake was considerably offended by Mary's tactless con tradictions and suggestions. \" You will allow me to judge for myself, Mary, whether the dinner and the post are not both slipping behind time.

I am not in my dotage yet, and I neither need to be diverted, nor am I in want of any device for passing away the time.\" Nobody knew how far Mrs Sheldrake had gone with her man of business in a fresh arrangement of her affairs, and it is needless to say that nobody ventured to ask her. A moral paralysis seemed to have seized hold of the people around her. Elizabeth, in her misery, was well nigh driven to the desperate alternative of writing to the man of business. But she shrank from an interference which might be wholly7 misjudged and would almost certainly be regarded by a cool, practical lawyer as a decidedly premature, if not an utterly un- warrantable, step on her part. Her mother, as she said, was not in her dotage, therefore on what plea, reasonable and not merely sentimental, could Elizabeth ask him to transfer to her keep- ing the confidence which Mrs Sheldrake had \u00a9 reposed in him ? How could Elizabeth, with any7 delicacy and propriety, intrude thus into her mother's private concerns ? How could she, with the most distant prospect of success, propose to a professional man whom she had not seen above once or twice in her life, to induce her mother to re-consider her decision and reverse it. He would think she was posing in an effort to parade her disinterestedness, or he would conclude she was a forward, silly, hysterical girl, who was not entitled to meddle in the business, even on her brother's account. If she had really wished to stand his friend with her mother, she might have"], [278, "The American Cousins 266 exerted herself to do it at an earlier stage of the quarrel, when the attempt would have been more admissible and more hopeful. Besides, Mrs Sheldrake's legal adviser would determine that whatever Elizabeth might say for herself, she could have no call to dispossess her cousin and future husband of what her mother chose to settle upon him out of the power she had acquired over her son's bonded estate. Neither would there be any good in Beville's writing the letter jointly with her and disclaiming thenceforth the wish to be put in Willie Sheldrake's place at Oakspur. For that w7ould only be a proof of Beville's weakness, or specious affectation, or of her overweening influence over him, of which she was conscious, and which troubled her. After the despatch of Elizabeth's letter to her brother, she and Mary had not been long in learning what George Sheldrake could have told them from the first. Willie was in America, furnished, as an afterthought, with abundant credentials from George, in addition to Elias Whitelaw's letters to his business correspondents. The information caused Elizabeth's sick heart to grow sicker as she reckoned how long it would take her brother to reach home, and how easily the letter might miss him, travelling as he was doing from place to place, from New York to Boston, from Boston to Washington, New Orleans, San Francisco. Another and more alarming report, which also took Elizabeth by surprise, which George likewise confirmed partially, was, that Elias Whitelaw was establishing a branch of his business in the States."], [279, "The American Cousins 267 A half project was entertained of puttiug Elias's son-in-law, under competent guidance, at tne head of the branch \u2014 provided he could be made to ex hibit an aptitude for business, in addition to a high-flying genius for mechanics and a craze for radicalism. He would get so-called equality to his heart's content under the stars and stripes. It was possible he had learnt his lesson, and would not insist on calling a black man or a Red Indian his brother, to the vexing of the susceptibilities of the dominant race of white men. Willie settled in America ! It must not be. He must come home first; he must be reconciled to his mother. If it were too late for her and him, Elizabeth would never forgive herself. She knew it was morbid to be always harping on that theme \" too late.\" She ought, as Mary told her, to be thankful to see her mother so like herself. Like, yet unlike, rising up and lying down under the decree which had gone forth, the execution of which might be deferred but would not be recalled, setting herself steadfastly \u2014 brave, honest woman that she was \u2014 to finish her tasks before the night fell. But it was not morbid, it was no more than truth and righteousness \u2014 awakened at last, to own to herself that she had been mean, spiteful, covetous, selfish. She had tempted another person, who, without her, would have resisted the impulse to greed and egotism. She had suffered her judg ment and her heart to be warped by pride and passion.

Mrs Sheldrake was unapproachable, unassailable by argument, inflexible in what she had taught herself to believe was her duty to her dead husband and his family, nay, to her son. What could Elizabeth do to prevent the wrong against which her conscience, when she would listen to it, had always rebelled ? She now saw it magni fied into hideousness, as, if there is any good in us, we live to see our errors to which we have yielded, in which we have been fain to indulge. Elizabeth looked so harassed and worn under the burden which she had piled on her back that Beville had the grace to make an admission to George as the brothers, at Mary's request, smoked the pipe of peace together in the old green-house, destroying the green fly while they soothed their own senses. \" Old boss, you were right,\" said Beville, rest ing his hand in the former familiar fashion on George's shoulder ; \" if her mother had died with out taking back her resolution, Elizabeth would never have forgiven herself. She could not have put out her brother even with his own consent and known peace afterwards. She would have eaten her heart out, and I meant never to cost her a pang ! \" \" It is well that you and she have come to your senses in time, Obadiah,\" said George, gruffly. \" Elizabeth is worth a hundred thousand Oakspurs,\" protested the bridegroom-elect loftily."], [281, "The American Cousins 269 \" Yet Oakspur is Oakspur, not to be despised, and it ought to have been old Humphrey Sheldrake, our ancestor's portion,\" he ended regretfully. \" Stop that,\" said George a little grimly ; \" you have seen the evil of going hankering after and nibbling at forbidden fruit.

The rain which threatened to fall during the night, or on the following day, still hung in safe suspension in the high canopy of shading but not lowering clouds. Mary had persuaded her mother to drive over with her to the vicarage. Dorothy and Eleanor were gone with their Fraulein on a shopping expedition to Coringham. Its chief zest consisted of the startling idea that in the new \" store \" (they had borrowed the word from their cousin George just as they had horrified their mother by calling a lady-bird a \" bug \") they might, only think of it ! be seated at the same counter with Willie's wife who might also be buying collars and cuff's. The girls would not know her unless she were to burst into tears, or faint, or something. She would know them, for of course most people in Coringham knew the Sheldrakes of Oakspur by sight, though the Sheldrakes did not return the compliment by knowing one Coringham person from another. If this native of Coringham whom"], [283, "The American Cousins 271 the Sheldrakes did not acknowledge as a member of their family \u2014 she was \" Young Mrs Sheldrake,\" all the same, nobody could deny that \u2014 happened to be at a loss as to their identity, her ignorance would be speedily enlightened. She had only to ask the shopman, with whom Fraulein Stock and her pupils had dealt ever since the opening of the new store the year before. As a result of this pretty little fancy, Dorothy and Eleanor stared hard at every young woman who entered the shop during their stay there, and even whispered excitedly to the discomfiture of Fraulein Stock, who knew that Mrs Sheldrake was particular about her daughters' manners. George and Beville Sheldrake had gone up to London for the week, to witness such sports as were \" on \" and to go the round of the principal theatres. Elizabeth was quite alone in the other Elizabeth Sheldrake's room, moping, it must be confessed, though she was making a pretence of having re sumed for the afternoon her former work of look ing over and sorting some of the old letters written centuries back, the latest letters written possibly at the very bureau at which she sat. She was roused by the impressive entrance of the elder man-servant who was as an fait to the present secrets and worries of the family as Elizabeth herself was. He came in with studious quietness, approaching to solemnity, and told her in a measured whisper that a lady and gentleman had just arrived. They had asked for Miss Shel drake, and he had told them Miss Sheldrake was not at home. He had ventured to add that Miss Elizabeth Sheldrake was at home. Then"], [284, "The American Cousins 272 they had given him their cards. He had shown them into the library, and he now presented the cards on his second best salver to Elizabeth. She took them up, looked at the names languidly, and gave a little jump \u2014 \" Elias Whitelaw \" and \"Mrs William Sheldrake.\" A horrible dread took possession of Elizabeth. Her mother might come in at any moment. She had been fond lately of going into the library when she returned from a drive and having afternoon tea brought in there. Because she could then read and answer, without any risk of inter ruption from visitors, such letters as came by the afternoon post. Mrs Sheldrake had got fidgety about immediately receiving and answering her letters as about other things. Fidgetiness in the large woman \u2014 constructed, mind and body, on heavy lines \u2014 who was usually so calm and metho dical in her ways, seemed out of place. It took a pitiful character, just as the unexpected weakness of an originally strong man will move the by stander to keen sympathy. \" Ask the lady and gentleman to come up here,\" said Elizabeth, after a moment's pause of silent consternation. There was no question of her mother's coming to Elizabeth's room, or indeed of anybody else invading it at this hour, and the stair which led to it did not join the main stair, so that a casual encounter might be avoided. But even as Elizabeth recollected this in a flash, the old phrase \" bundled up the back stairs \" also recurred to her. She realised that this was Willie's wife's first arrival at Oakspur, of which, in right of her husband, she was by law and"], [285, "The American Cousins 273 courtesy the mistress, whatever reserve of power was in the hands of Mrs Sheldrake to nullify the distinction. And this was the reception accorded to the mistress of the house ! Another consideration very soon present with Elizabeth was what right had she to act in the matter ? Mrs Sheldrake, with all her respect for her children as Sheldrakes, had kept the reins of government in her own hands. Since her illness, indeed, before her illness, since her son had gone his own way and so complicated the settlement of her affairs, she had shown herself more reticent than ever. She had given signs of develop ing an irritable jealousy of interference on the part of her children, a mortified suspicion that they were already treating her as if she were in capable of managing her life. Along with it was a haunting dread lest they should be right, lest she should fail at any moment in the use of the powers she still possessed \u2014 her tongue cleave to the roof of her mouth, her mind refuse to act. In the circumstances it might have been better for Elizabeth not to have stirred in the matter, to have refused to see Mr Elias Whitelaw and his daughter. Her justification was that the step she took was taken in the instinctive desire to protect her mother, to come between her and annoyance in her weakened state. The fear of the consequences of an encounter between her and Mr Elias White law was much greater than any apprehension of her displeasure because of Elizabeth's taking the initiative. Why had the father and daughter come now when they had not come before in the interval s"], [286, "The American Cousins 274 which had elapsed since the marriage ? Had poor unhappy Willie got into fresh disgrace? Had news come that he was ill or \u2014 ? Elizabeth put the thought from her by a violent effort and com posed herself, telling herself strenuously that if anything serious or terrible had happened surely Willie's wife would not come abroad to be the bearer of the heavy tidings. The stumbling feet, on what could not be denied was the steep, uneven old stair, reached the top, came along the little corridor, and Burton ushered in a stout little man in a grey morning suit, and a girl in a light dust cloak, shut the door behind \u00a9 \u00a9 > them, and retreated with marked care. \"Miss Elizabeth Sheldrake, I presume,\" said Elias, clearing his throat and speaking, not aggres sively7, but with a strong sense of his right to speak, while his eyes took a swift roam round the ancient room. He called it disdainfully in his mind \" a dark, musty hole, with a roof coming down on your head, and a small-paned window through which you could not see the light of day. In no office or foundry in Coringham, not to say in no room in an airy villa on the outskirts, would such a makeshift for a window be tolerated for a moment. Elizabeth, who had risen and bowed in assent to Elias's supposition, asked her visitors to sit down, and sat down herself. Her knees were trembling beneath her, for all her long descent, high breeding and high spirit, which, to be sure, had been con siderably shaken and broken within the last few weeks. She was behaving with grave, troubled courtesy7, while she was unable to resist glancing"], [287, "The American Cousins 275 at the inoffensive- looking girl who had been too big a bone of contention for the family to swallow, even to try to swallow. She seemed very harmless, and she was certainly disturbed on her own account. She was not in the least in a shop-girl style of beauty with the last new thing in a fringe, ogling eyes, red and white cheeks and a wasp waist \u2014 that Willie should have fancied her! She was a colour less, formless little woman, who seemed and was in her matronhood younger than Elizabeth was in her girlhood. As to her being smart as Eliza beth had always expected her to be \u2014 tricked out in the bridal finery which need not have been worn out, she was dressed plainly to dowdiness, as if she had come off with her father without waiting to dress for the occasion. She was not vulgar-looking any more than she was boldly defiant. Neither was she in a scared panic. She appeared a little nervous, anxious and grieved \u2014 that was all. She had not sufficient self-consciousness to be fairly frightened. Elias proceeded to monopolise the conversation. The man was there to show himself, manly, kind, even magnanimous, but as one effect of the strain on his feelings, he forgot, as he would have said, such manners as he had laboriously acquired. He was thrown back on the homeliness of the work ing machinist who had laid the foundation of his fortunes with his own clever mechanic's hands, obeying his inventive mechanic's brain. \" I would 'ave you know, ma'am,\" Elias was say ing, \" that this young 'oman is your brother's wife, of whom you have no cause to be ashamed. 'Old up your 'ead, Gussy, and do your father and mother,"], [288, "The American Cousins 276 the honest folks you've come of and your 'usband in particular, credit on your first coming among his people.\" \" We have not come to do ourselves credit, father,\" said Gussy's low, sweet voice, while a faint smile parted her soft lips and hovered over them. \" Ah ! I see the attraction now,\" Elizabeth was telling herself, \" she is sweet looking. George Sheldrake had some grounds for taking her part. What candid, guileless eyes she has, aud her full, open forehead is not that of a fool or a rogue \u2014 at least not what one is accustomed to ascribe to either. She looks as much sweeter and truer than Mona Kershaw, as a garden rose is sweeter and fresher than a forced, fantastic orchid with a drop of poison in its calyx. She did not take Willie in, whoever did him that ill turn. I am sorry for her now, more than for him. He has got her into a mess for which she will never blame him, and very likely it will be owing chiefly to her patience and self-denial if the two are ever dragged out.\" \" No, what we have come for, Miss Elizabeth Sheldrake,\" Elias was hastening to explain, \" is that we 'eard some time ago, your poor mother was took bad, and we've waited quiet to see if her ill ness would pass off.

Was this woman's love the love of a wife for her husband alone, or had Elizabeth never known what the word meant ? \" My mother and all of us are much obliged to you, of course,\" Elizabeth stammered. \" Oh, no hobligation,\" Elias waived off the term. Elizabeth hesitated. Her confusion was greater than anything of the kind she had ever felt before. She was wont to be mistress of the situations in which she found herself, a stay and support to her friends, not a reed swayed by the wind. \" But you are speaking under a misconception. My mother is not so ill as to require a nurse. She is better \u2014 almost well arrain. She is out driving at \u00a9 \u00a9 this moment.\" Then as Elias shook his head in incredulous condemnation of so imprudent a pro ceeding, Elizabeth was nettled into adding with some haughtiness, \"And if she needed a nurse she has her daughters. Surely you, who seem to put a high value on family ties, will grant that her daughters who have grown up with her, come nearer to her than her son's wife to whom she has never spoken, whom she has not so much as seen.\" \"Whose faults was that?\" demanded Elias, sharply. Gussy put on his arm a gentle restraining hand which he shook off instantly, for when Elias's temper got the better of him he would not be crossed by his own flesh and blood any more than by strangers. \" It stands to reason,\" he said sulkily, \" that a"], [291, "The American Cousins 279 young lady like you can know nothing about nursing the sick.\" \" Why not ? \" urged Elizabeth, pursuing her advantage and glad to feel her courage and reso lution returning. \" Why should I not be as capable as your daughter ?

Come, father, do not let us detain Miss Sheldrake any longer, if we are quick we may catch the five o'clock train.\" \" But I have something more to say,\" objected Elias, doggedly. \" It is you who have forgotten your manners now, Gussy. I wish mother had come with you as she wished. She would have kept you in order. She would have told the young lady that it ain't a light matter, and it mightn't be at a small cost that you're trapesing here to-day. And you to speak of 'urrydng back as if you were your sister Sophy or any other young girl, without so much as a ten minutes' rest or a cup of tea ! Wliy it might be as much as your life and the life of another are worth with an 'usband and father to answer to for being guilty of such rank imprudence.\" \" Father, father,\" besought Gussy, with the pretty pink of girlish modesty flooding her pale little face. \" And I 'aven't said my say,\" persisted Elias, \" and it was as much for that as to offer Gussy's 'elp that I came here. Look 'ere, Miss Elizabeth Sheldrake,\" and Elias in his earnestness and de termination leant half across the person he ad dressed and emphasised his remarks by the top of"], [293, "The American Cousins 281 his supple right thumb in the palm of his left hand, \" I daresay you've 'eard of me as well-to-do Coringham ways, and I ain't what you'd call a needy man, I'm 'appy to say for all our sakes. But I'd be a deal warmer man across the Hatlantic. I've always knowed it, and I've been still more convinced of it by one that 'as had opportunities for knowing. There's more scope for my business yonder. For one that makes ten 'undred guineas here by his hinventions and hindustry, there are dozens that score their ten 'undred thousand dollars over there. Bless you, miss, it would take away your breath to 'ear of the monster fortunes made by little bits of machines not half so large as my small boy's bycycle. Sewing machines, knit ting machines, bread-cutting machines, clothes wringing machines and the like in them blessed States. I hope I ain't greedy, but I confess I am a trifle tired of the slack times in Coriugham and the rumpasses with the fools of hoperatives. I've no manner of doubt that the slack times and the fools are to be found all the world over, though we've been in the 'abit of saying that 'Merica was the paradise for working men. We've to seek farther for the paradise now-a-day7s ; but leastways there's room in the States still and a call for new improvements at any season \u2014 spring, summer, and fall, nay, I believe in the dead of winter the sledge trade offers as good a hopening as any.

She looked at the man's daughter, but she threw no light on the disserta tion, in fact Gussy w7as too well accustomed to Elias's eloquence to be astonished at it. His next words, however, seemed to present a solution to the riddle. \" I see no reason why I should be content with less, or rest satisfied with leaving Lyddy, my missus, and the girls a long shot from being millionaires. I ain't acting rashly, I've consulted the best authorities and sent spies afore me \u2014 any how one spy, your gentleman brother. He knows a thing or two, though I won't say that the tiles on his head-piece are all as firm as they7 ought to be.\" Was he seeking to bribe her by the fortune he pro fessed to make in America, and was he trying to add to his own merits by depreciating poor Willie's ? \" Mr Whitelaw, I don't see why you should tell me all this,\" she broke in, fidgeting uneasily, for the time was passing. Her mother might return. Mary might come for Elizabeth to relieve guard. Since their mother's illness the elder girls had been sufficiently alarmed to maintain a surreptitious watch over their mother \u2014 a source of irksome con straint to both the watchers and the watched. The younger girls might rush in to proclaim the result of their shopping. \" Naturally there is no reason why you should not emigrate to America,\" as she said the word, she had an almost comical sense that everybody was going to America and she among the rest, but then America was \" a wide word.\" \" Why should you not if your prospects are still better there, as you imply, and if your family think they would like the change ? But I really"], [295, "The American Cousins 283 don't understand much about it, and if you will forgive me for saying so, I do not see what I have to do with it.\" That sounded rude, and though Elizabeth was aweary she did not wdsh to be rude in her own house to Willie's connections, who had meant to be kind, knowing no better. She made an effort to be conciliatory, always seeing with side glances, and being indescribably touched, she could hardly tell why, by what she saw \u2014 the soft, sweet, steadfast face of the girl who looked wan and tired on her own account; who had come away in a hurry in her dust cloak and sailor's hat, prepared to make herself useful in a house of sickness. \" I believe my cousin George Sheldrake is a friend of yours. You may have been alluding to him in some of the things you have said, I think you may quite rely on his opinion. Now,\" getting flurried again as she spoke, \" since you have been good enough to remind me of what I ought not to have forgotten, that you have come some distance with the intention of helping us, and that you are yourselves in need of rest and refreshment, will you remain here, and will you allow me to send up a tray with tea and cold meat, or soup or wine \u2014 what you prefer ? I am sorry that I cannot ask you to come to the dining-room, and you must excuse me for leaving you, because I expect my mother back from her drive every moment, and though she is better she is not fit to see strangers, or to be put about \u2014 she could not stand anything like \u2014 like a scene. Oh ! I hope you understand that,\" and Elizabeth clasped her hands in increas ing agitation and genuine distress which was fast mastering her."], [296, "284 CHAPTER XIX AN INTERRUPTION Elias had only followed Elizabeth half way in her hasty attempt at propitiation. He was looking baffled and disappointed. \" You don't mean it,\" he burst out, \" that it is no concern of yours though we go bag and baggage ? I was in right down earnest in what I said ; I do want to make what I can of my liabilities and my hexperience. I don't stomach being second best nowheres, it ain't doing justice to myself. The foundry in Coringham and Daisyniead are all very well. But a foundry or 'alf a dozen foundries twice as large again, and 'alf a dozen Daisymeads \u2014 one on an 'illside \u2014 one in a hisland on a great river or lake, or by the seaside \u2014 and one in a city by way of change \u2014 a brand new mansion that would 'old this old manor-house sitting comfortable in its lap, easy, all that would be a sight better still. Not that it would not be a wrench, a mortal wrench, for I was Warwickshire born and Warwickshire I 'oped to die. I married \u2014 as I've never regretted doing \u2014 a Warwickshire lass, as blooming and as clever in her day7 as e'er a one in Coringham, and my children were born there. But I've made up my mind to go, and"], [297, "The American Cousins 285 Lyddy will follow me to the North Pole, though she had other views for herself and her girls. We'll take Sophy, but we'll leave the flower of the flock behind,\" looking with regretful pride and affection at Gussy. \" For, I'm free to tell you, Miss Elizabeth Sheldrake, that your gentleman brother ain't fit for mechanics save to play hisself with models, and, as for pushing trade, bargaining and horganising, they hain't his line \u2014 no more than spouting hanarchy, though he thinks the last is.\" \" Father ! \" interrupted Gussy, in a flutter of wounded affection, indignant for the beloved being thus decried and slandered. \" How could you expect Willie, who never served an apprenticeship, who was never trained in practical mechanics, to master at once all the laws and rules which separate theory from practice ? He has done wonders as it is, even if he did no more. I have heard you say he has awakened the interest and directed the attention of more practical men, by his inventions, to further inventions. He has paved the way for more skilled machinists. As for anarchy, if to love one's neighbour as one's self, if to desire his good with an ardour which makes a man like my dear husband blind and deaf to his own success or failure, praise or blame, then I too would be an anarchist if God would give me strength of purpose and purity of heart to work for Him and for my brothers and sisters.\" Not the least strange of the strange sensations which this encounter had brought to Elizabeth was to hear Willie Sheldrake thus arraigned and thus defended, not by\u00abher, but by another woman who openly claimed him as her nearest and dearest."], [298, "The American Cousins 286 It was such a keen realisation of his marriage and of his belonging now and thenceforth to this girl, rather than to Elizabeth and her family, as had not occurred to her till then. \"My little girl,\" said Elias, letting his hand fall on Gussy's shoulder in fond deprecation before he dismissed her defence as foreign to his argu ment, \" 'ome is the place for him, 'ome and his duties as a landlord. He is on his way to do your bidding,\" eyeing Elizabeth fixedly, \" which is as well, seeing I'm confidently assured, if he had stayed where he was and gone on as he was doing, he was safe to be lynched before many more months had passed over his 'ead. He may arrive cured, who knows ? But he must keep to his class and his duties. And you don't mean to say, Miss Elizabeth Sheldrake, that we won't clear his way and Gussy's, by going off to t'other side of the world ? You'll be rid of us, every one. W7e sha'n't be here to affront you and to come between you and your brother and his wife. You'll just 'ave Gussy 'ere to put up with, and if you can't keep the peace with little Gussy, aye, and shape her to your hends, I'll say this, you're mortal 'ard to please.\" \"Don't go, father,\" cried Gussy, with tender anguish, \"don't speak of clearing the way for Willie and me. Oh ! how could you do us the wrong of supposing that we wished you to go \u2014 that we were ashamed of the foundry or you, or mother or anybody ? \" Elias patted his daughter's hand and shook his head. \"You ain't ashamed, dear, no and I don't say he is. 'E is too much of the real gentleman"], [299, "The American Cousins 287 for that, I'll give him his due. But you've made your choice, child, and you must abide by your 'usband and think what is best for 'im and 'is, to reconcile them. You must let your own folks go.\" The speakers were so engrossed with their con versation that they had not heard wheels or a slow step on the stair, and the words were barely out of Elias's mouth when the door opened, and to the dismay and discomfiture of all, including the stout-hearted Elias, Mrs Sheldrake stood in the doorway. She had been unusually refreshed and exhilarated by her drive, and whether to test her strength or to give Elizabeth a surprise, she had taken the unusual step of mounting to her daughter's room. Mrs Sheldrake stood with those fixed eyes of hers and turned a hard gaze on the visitors. Un doubtedly she recognised or guessed their identity, for the high colour in her face rapidly acquired a purple strain in its redness, her compressed lips took a bluish tinge, and she went through the action of swallowing with a gulp, as if her throat, on which the veins were standing out, refused to do its office. Elizabeth sprang forward in terror. Gussy quivered and shivered all over in the extremity of her emotion. Elias stood firm. He even stamped a step towards the newcomer as the prelude to an ex clamation, \"Ma'am,\" he said, \"we 'eard you had been took ill and we came over from Coringham, your son's wife and me, to ask for you and to offer to do what we could for you.\" \"Sir, I'm obliged for the attention,\" the thick"], [300, "The American Cousins 288 voice of the figure swaying a little, so as to make Elizabeth's heart stand still, struggled to say, \" but I am in my own house, where, till my son thinks fit to turn me out, I cannot consent to receive visitors, except those who are my friends.\" She stopped, evidently startled by a burst of hysterical weeping from poor Gussy, who in her weak abnormal state of health had at last broken down under the prolonged trial to nerves and feelings to which she had been exposed. Mrs Sheldrake turned to her daughter-in-law and took in her whole aspect. A sudden wonder ful change came over the elder woman's face, gait and manner. Her disturbed circulation righted itself as by a miracle. The congested blood ebbed from her cheeks and lips. Her attitude relaxed, she recovered her balance. Her eyes lighted up with a great not unpleasant surprise. It caused a new set of feelings to spring instantaneously into existence \u2014 feelings which at once stimulated and softened, instead of stunning and hardening her. She walked straight across to Gussy, as firmly as Mrs Sheldrake had ever walked, she spoke as if her articulation had never faltered, yet she was extremely impatient, even highly indignant, with those around her. \" What do you mean ? How could you be so inconsiderate ? \" she demanded sharply. \" You might have seen \u2014 the blindest of you, and men are always blind,\" \u2014 this for the transfixed, conscience-stricken Elias \u2014 \" but even a bat might have seen an inch before its nose. I cannot tell what her mother was thinking of to trust her with you. Couldn't you guess she was not fit for such a journey, and to be baited"], [301, "The American Cousins 289 and badgered at the end of it ? It was positively barbarous. If I had not come in when I did just now, there is no saying the harm you might have done. Go away all of you, and leave me to manage her alone. I know what to do, she will be better left with me. You must compose your self, my dear, I am sure you don't wish to hurt yourself. You will lie down on Elizabeth's bed when I bid you. I won't go, I'll stay with you. Elizabeth, did you hear me speak ? Take the gentleman downstairs to the library or the draw ing-room, oh ! anywhere, and send Maria here with my toilet vinegar, the poor child's fore head is burning hot, and tell cook to bring up a cup of strong beef tea. No, no, don't speak,\" as Gussy strove convulsively to check her sobs in order to pant out how good, how kind, Mrs Sheldrake was to her, and how deep and lasting must be her \u2014 Gussy's \u2014 gratitude. \"I know all about it. I understand just what you feel, so that there is no need to tell me. You must be quite still, and if you can fall asleep presently it will be the best thing possible, and we shall all be very glad and greatly obliged to you.\" The patient had turned physician and would not be denied her office. Elias and Elizabeth stared at each other in blank amazement as they were forced to quit the room together. Elizabeth was so un strung that she fell to consulting the person nearest to her, who happened to be Elias. \" Do you think we ought to leave them ? I am so afraid mother will hurt herself. I must think of her first. Indeed I am very sorry if your daughter has done herself any harm, but my T"], [302, "The American Cousins 290 mother, who has just recovered from a dangerous illness, must be my first consideration.\" \" Of course, miss,\" assented Elias, who was fast recovering himself and was able to speak with cheerful magnanimity, \" but I have no fears that either of them will be really the worse for thus making each other's acquaintance suddent. They must have done it some time unless they were to bear each other a grudge down to the grave. That were far from our Gussy, and I begin to think it would not come altogether natural to madam neither. Gussy has a good sound constitootion to fall back upon, though she is a white-faced, small boned, soft thing without the mettle of her sister. It is only her delicate condition, poor young 'oman, as I ought to have paid more 'eed to that has been too much for her, that and the circumstances of the case \u2014 her 'usband out of the country and his people 'ostile to her up to this day, though I'll engage Gussy kept up as long as she could, not to trouble nobody. She was always against giving trouble when she was the smallest mite that could 'ardly stand alone. Your mother, bless you 1 she understands, as she said she is full of her fellow feelings as a wife and mother, and they have carried everything before them for the time. There ain't nothing that such women like better than to fuss about babbies coming and come, and the mothers as is bearing or 'as borne them, the father and bread winner, and all other grown up people are of no himportance in comparison. And, Lord, the women are right, the world would soon come to an end if the babby did not reign king over his family till he's able to do for his-"], [303, "The American Cousins 291 self, or till his nose is put out of joint by the arrival of his next brother or sister. And to think, madam \u2014 your mother, to whom we 'ave not been fair, I own it with shaame \u2014 madm, that we thought stuck up and cold, and cruel to her own flesh and blood, is as motherly at the core when you get at it, as other good women ! \" \"Yes, indeed,\" said Elizabeth, and in the re action she had gone through, the tears were on her cheeks without her knowing it. \" Mother has been the best of wives and mothers. You were far wrong if you ever thought otherwise.\" \" I don't doubt it now,\" said Elias, stoutly, \" if that will make amends. If I had knowed in time, I would have thought twice afore I had let that John-a-Dreams of a son of hers and son-in-law of mine, turn his back upon her and vex her.\" Elizabeth winced a little, but she was learning greater liberality and forbearance. \" Willie meant no harm,\" she said sadly, \" we ought to have considered that, and we did not take him the right way. We were to blame almost as much as he was, and, Mr Whitelaw, you may trust mother to do the best she can for your daughter.\" \" I am trusting her,\" said Elias, with emphasis ; \" moreover it is her daughter as well as mine she's taking the responsibility of, for she's your sister as well as Sophy's, young miss, though I don't know as you've ever called her so,\" he remarked, with a slight renewal of the old jealous bitterness, \" yet you've no reason to be ashamed of the best girl in Coringham.\" \" I am not ashamed of her, if I ever was,\" said"], [304, "The American Cousins 292 Elizabeth, frankly. \" I take back my word now that I've seen her, and beg her pardon and yours. She is not only Willie's wife, and so mother's daughter and the sister of me and my sisters; she's somebody whom I'm sure I'll learn to love as I learn to know her.\" \" Thank you for that word, Miss Elizabeth Shel drake,\" said Elias, heartily. \" It is spoken like a good woman and a true lady ; like the sister of your brother when he is at his best, and not taken up with fly-away politics and mechanics run mad.\" As soon as Gussy was soothed to sleep, Mrs Sheldrake had a private interview with Elias. She disdained the anxious intervention of her elder daughters, and she came out of the en counter more mistress of herself, and more cheer ful than she had been for many a day. The result of the interview was that Gussy, with her own brave, meek consent, remained for the time under the personal care and guardianship of her mother in-law. The position was entirely reversed so far as Gussy's nursing Mrs Sheldrake was concerned, but all the same Elias returned half triumphant, half subdued, without his daughter, to Coringham. It was Mary's turn to be electrified, and the young girls to be wildly excited by the news that Willie's wife was in the house and was to stay there for a time, so that they must see the strange kinswoman about whom they had so often specu lated, as soon as she could quit the room which mother was making her keep. Was she really ill ? was it not a mere excuse for mother's locking her up because she was too dreadfully vulgar to be seen or spoken to ? If so, would she always be"], [305, "The American Cousins 293 locked up and kept in the background, even if she were not fed on bread and water ? for Dorothy and Eleanor's sharp eyes had not missed the ample stores of dainty food carried up for Mrs William Sheldrake's consumption. Had mother the power to lock up anybody permanently ? Would not the law interfere ? Or oh ! would not Willie hurry over from America to accomplish a spirited rescue on his wife's behalf ? Mrs Sheldrake was the head of her own house. She had never been answerable for what she did to anyone, save to her easy-going elderly husband, honestly grateful to her for the relief which her fortune had brought to his straitened finances. In explanation of her present conduct, it was sufficient for her to say, \"The young lady is Mrs William Sheldrake, my son's wife. It has come to my knowledge that she is not being cared for and attended to in his absence as she should be. I could not answer to my conscience for not taking her into my own hands, at least, till her husband returns and claims her.\" Oh ! poor Mrs Whitelaw, to be thus aspersed, to have her daughter filched out of her fingers at the most interesting epoch of Gussy's history, when, if she had ever belonged to her own mother she did so now, most peculiarly. To know Gussy lodged at Oakspur, and yet not to be able to boast of it, to contemplate leaving her and the honours which had been dearly earned, while the rest of the Whitelaws departed to a country where, to have a daughter in the far distance, an English squire's wife, was a family matter of comparatively little consequence to the world at large."], [306, "The American Cousins 294 Within the next day or two Mrs Sheldrake paid Elizabeth another visit in her room. The matron was still braced up and inspirited, though at the moment she had a weight on her mind, of which she was fain to disburden herself. \" Elizabeth,\" she said, with an effort, \" I have come up on purpose to speak to you, between ourselves, of something which concerns you par ticularly. But when Beville comes back I must see him too, at once, on the same subject. I hope neither of you will be dreadful^7 disappointed. I believe I was not sufficiently careful in keeping my intentions to myself till your settlements were drawn out. I am afraid my intention leaked out, and now I have the difficult task of telling you that I see reason to reverse it.\" \" Mother,\" said Elizabeth, hastening to anticipate the communication so as to make it easier for her mother, while she shook up the cushion on the high-backed chair Mrs Sheldrake had taken, \" it is for you to dispose of your property7 just as you think fit. I have not the slightest cause to doubt that you will be not only just, but generous to all your children. I can vouch for it that Beville will say the same. Don't trouble about us or anything we may have fancied.\" \" It is only a question of landed estate or money in the funds,\" said Mrs Sheldrake, wistfully. \" I never intended that in other respects your portion should exceed Mary's.\" \" Of course not,\" said Elizabeth, hastily. \" Beville and I will have enough, more than enough. It is only right, and what father intended, that Willie should have Oakspur. He has not really done"], [307, "The American Cousins 295 anything to forfeit his right. I think we should have seen that \u2014 in the end, Beville and I \u2014 though we were tempted, horribly tempted,\" she admitted impulsively. \" But now that we have had time to think ; now that we have come to know his wife and to feel that she is a good girl, though she is not one of ourselves, one of whom we have no right to be ashamed, oh ! I think we were very silly and proud and prejudiced. George always saw the matter in that light. We must grow fond of \u00a9 G her and live to rejoice that she will do Willie good and not evil all the days of his life.\" \" Elizabeth,\" her mother interrupted her solemnly, \" it is not either of my son or of this poor girl, his wife, I am thinking. It is of their innocent, unborn child, whom I was about to disinherit in my lack of foresight.\" \" W7illie's little baby,\" said Elizabeth, softly. \"It is wonderful ; it is incredible,\" with a fluttering laugh. \" When I saw her soon to become a mother,\" Mrs Sheldrake went on unheeding, \" and knew it was a new generation of Sheldrakes about to see the light, my eyes were opened and I could not do it. I know how fond you have always been of this place, but it was my husband's direct male descend ants, my husband's race in the branch sprung from his son, I was about to cut off. Oh! Elizabeth, I trust you are not very much disappointed.\" \"Mother!\" cried Elizabeth, with a dry sob in her voice, which she must keep calm for her mother's sake, \" if you only knew how glad I am to give up the dear old place. I shall see it always in my dreams. I shall speak of it constantly, but it will be with a light heart and an easy conscience"], [308, "296 The American Cousins after Oakspur is given up to those who will be its rightful owners in the future \u2014 remote I trust \u2014 not till you have seen your grandchildren playing about your knees.

The older woman found a congenial occupation in busying herself about the girl and in ordering all she did, a bondage to which Gussy heroically submitted. Nobody else ventured to interfere. Nobody at Oakspur thwarted Mrs Sheldrake. Nobody at Coringham asserted a title to be heard in the matter. Not even poor fussy little Mrs Whitelaw, whose prerogatives were not strictly respected at this season, after Elias had pompously and proudly announced that Gussy was to stay on for a little time at Oakspur, though the old lady was \" on her feet \" and fairly well again. George and Beville Sheldrake, on returning from London, became acquainted with the new aspect of affairs to George's unqualified satisfaction, and with only a passing qualm of regret on the part of Beville as he witnessed the spring sunshine gild ing the huge lichen -grown arms of the oaks in the"], [310, "The American Cousins 298 park, and the moss clothing the mullions of the lovely old windows. But it was true that he loved Elizabeth before a thousand Oakspurs, and that it was a great consolation to him to feel as he had not been able to feel lately, that he was behaving like a knightly7 old Sheldrake, like his namesake and ancestor in Stratford church, pro perly idealised. (For, to tell the truth, Sir Beville of statesman and courtier renown had not been in his lifetime particularly famous for a scrupul ous and disinterested regard for his neighbours' rights of property.) George was acting as the custodian of the house \u00a9 \u00a9 one afternoon when Mrs Sheldrake had taken her daughter-in-law for her first drive in the old fashioned, dignified, not too easy carriage. Gussy was dutifully trying to like it, while she showed herself deeply grateful for the attention and highly flattered by it Mary was in the village looking up her Sunday school scholars, and she had for the nonce suc ceeded in enlisting Dorothy and Eleanor as value able auxiliaries in the work. Elizabeth and Beville had resumed their home antiquarian researches in the lanes and meadows, with their significant names and traditions. Zest was added to the pursuit by the knowledge that if must soon come to an end. George was sitting solitary, reading in the library when he was taken aback. Announce ment was made to him by Burton, with a twinkle of the privileged servant's eye. The dignified butler did not altogether approve of the senior American cousin with his free and easy"], [311, "The American Cousins 299 ways and mocking tongue. He would poke fun at a well-bred servant arrived at the years of discretion. He \u2014 George \u2014 would use improper language to him \u2014 Burton \u2014 such as addressing him as \" Uncle,\" \" Uncle Thingumiebob,\" or \" Latest Edition of Diggory.\" \"A young lady wishes to see you, sir,\" was Burton's announcement. \" A lady ! \" exclaimed George, springing up from what must be confessed was a position of which Burton decidedly disapproved \u2014 namely George's chair tilted back and his long legs raised till the toes of his boots lightly touched the brass rim of the central table. \" Great Scott ! What lady wants me ? Young \u2014 the dickens she is ! But, Uncle Dogberry, it is a mistake. It is Miss Sheldrake \u2014 one of the Miss Sheldrakes, not a Master Sheldrake, she's after.\" \" No it ain't, sir,\" answered Burton, provoked into being abrupt and natural. \" She asked for Mr George Sheldrake, if he were at home \u2014 if he \u00a9 were in, as plain as tongue could speak. She's followed me in, being that keen to see you, sir, and is at my back.\" Sure enough an eager young figure was at Burton's back ready to push past him and to hurry up breathlessly in an appeal to George. It was Sophy W7hitelaw \u2014 Sophy not in a sailor hat and dust cloak as Gussy had gone off' at a mo ment's notice, but Sophy at her smartest. She was in her best spring costume, in which there was a good deal of puff's of inserted velvet, bead embroidery and frilled riband and a hat rolled, punched and pinched into fantastic picturesqueness and"], [312, "77*? American Cousins 300 crowned with nodding feathers. There was no doubt that Sophy looked very pretty and smart in this dress, which was piquant and becoming. But it was also true that it was not exactly suited for an impromptu trip by railway and a hurried walk from a country station, or for an unauthor ised visit to a gentleman. Neither Mary nor Elizabeth Sheldrake, George somehow guessed, would have worn such a dress on such an occasion. Was that what the Sheldrakes meant when they said that girls like the Coringham girls showed a vulgar insensibility in their toilets to what was suitable in time and place ? George advanced to welcome his visitor. He liked her, he liked her very much \u2014 all the more that she amused not less than she pleased him. She was a funny, mercurial-spirited, ardent little girl, with odd crannies in her mind stuffed full of every kind of crude, scrappy, undigested informa tion which she was ready to flourish in people's faces with an innocent conviction of its value. In George's frequent visits to Elias Whitelaw during the winter, the American's acquaintance with Miss Sophy, begun at Laburnum Lodge under very saucy auspices on her part, had ripened into quite a friendly intimacy. Sophy had got over the affront she had given herself by her own girlish forwardness and foolishness in trespassing on George's indulgence and good-nature. Her conscience had long been at rest with regard to the dish-covers extracted from his cousinly liberality. If there was any crow to pluck with him now, it was because of something she stronody suspected and occasionally indignantly accused"], [313, "The American Cousins 301 him of being guilty. The offence was that he laughed at as well as with her. But he was not laughing at her at the present moment, he was regarding her with comical, hardly disguised dismay, even while he put her into that easiest lounging chair from which he had risen. He saw she was heated and tired, and as nearly overcome as so spirited and courageous a girl could be. He sat down on the table opposite to her and waited to hear what she had to say to him. Good Heavens ! why had she not asked for her sister if she knew no one else at Oakspur ? There might be too many of the Whitelaw batch there already. George had been decidedly of Elias's opinion that the move of the rest of the family to America would clear the way for Willie Sheldrake and the wife he had chosen. Poor Sophy's audacious, out-of-order intrusion might be specially injudicious and ill-timed ; but if she had inquired for her sister, as she had a right to do, at least it could not be found fault with on the score of propriety. It came across George with a most laughable sense of absurdity that he should be figuring, even in his own eyes, as a stickler for propriety. He was an unconventional man. He had been accustomed to the compara tively untrammelled standards of Americans. Yet more even than Beville would have seen it, George had an instinctive consciousness of the light in which a certain inconsiderate style of behaviour, with no bad intention, from no objectionable motive, would be regarded by his English cousins. Why, Jt would be viewed with a still more evil interpre-"], [314, "The American Cousins 302 tation by the faster members of the Sheldrakes' class, by the Mona Kershaws and the Dodos of society. They respected as a rule an outward code of decorum, even when they were most flagrantly outraging in spirit, if not in deed, all that was pure and lovely, honest and of good report. It vexed George beyond reason that Sophy Whitelaw should incur censure \u2014 not merely from the Monas and Dodos of county society, not simply from matter-of-fact, self-satisfied Mary Sheldrake, but from the far more open-minded and sympa thetic Elizabeth. He told himself that it was on Gussy's account, because of the renewed prejudices which Sophy's unsolicited visit \u2014 to him of all people would arouse, that he was annoyed. He could not laugh at Sophy's vagary as he laughed at most of the illogical actions of her kind. And behold ! Gussy's name was the first word which burst from the intractable mouth of Sophy, who was doing so much to undo what Gussy and her father together had effected. \" It is about Gussy that I have come to speak to you, Mr Sheldrake,\" Sophy got out at last, with her young breast still heaving high under her fine semi artistic costume, the tears starting to her bright dark eyes and her red lips quivering. It was enough to move the heart of a stone, if only the girl had not been behaving like a fool, and George had always thought Sophy not a fool, on the contrary a great deal cleverer than Gussy. He was mad with Sophy for her own sake. He had seen the gleam of derision in that superior old rascal Burton's eyes. He had heard the tone of the voice in which Burton had said there was a young lady asking to"], [315, "The American Cousins 303 see Mr George Sheldrake and bent on attaining her end. What could the girl be thinking of, never to have been at Oakspur and to come there to call on him ? What were her father and mother about to let her take a trip on the railway alone on so preposterous an errand ? Suppose anyone \u2014 stranger or member of the family, his brother Beville even, or those monkeys Dorothy and Eleanor, not to say their mother, were to turn up, walk promiscuously into the library and find him \u2014 George closeted with Miss Sophy Whitelaw. \"What about Gussy \u2014 Mrs William, I mean? I supposed, of course, your father would tell you she was all right,\" he answered her abruptly. \" Oh ! it was not that.\" cried Sophy, ready to pour forth her confidences. \" I know of course that they have received her here as they ought to have done from the beginning; it is not that. It is of how they are treating her, I must hear if they are really good to Gussy, if she does not want to see me, as I want \u2014 oh, so much, to see her.\" Sophy sank back nearly exhausted by her expedi tion. It had been conducted much more on the principle of an impetuous rush, with less com mon sense and prudence than Elias Whitelaw had been able to practise, though he had brought away Gussy as he had found her taking an airing in the liliputian grounds of Laburnum Lodge. The girl's heart was surcharged with loving anxiety and wounded affection till she could barely keep the hot tears from rolling down her hot cheeks as she spoke. \" Don't cry, my dear Sophy, my dear young"], [316, "The American Cousins 304 lady,\" he implored her, \" and don't mind anything I say, for I'm as rough a diamond as you'll find in any drinking saloon. But I don't know,\" thrusting his hands into the depths of his coat pockets in his extremity, \" that I quite deserve you should start off crying and set all this yere old jackass's nerves on the twitter. There, give a laugh, that's right, that's a deal better. Do you mean you would like to see your sister and judge for yourself how she's getting on\u2014 famously, I can tell you. But I don't think there need be any great difficulty in you hearing the assurance out of her own mouth, when she returns from her drive \u2014 that is, since I saw her go out with Mrs Sheldrake.\" Did Sophy suppose her sister was shut up and detained against her will, while all the time there was a specious pretence of taking care of her and driving out with her? He had seen that the babies of the house laboured under this romantic delusion. But even if Miss Sophy had shared it, why could she not insist on being taken straight to her sister's room, there to await her return ? That would have been the rational course, and George could only imagine that the very irrationality and tortuousness of the mode proposed had recom mended it to a woman. \" No,\" Sophy was saying, shaking the head in the plumed hat ruefully, \" I could not do that; \u2014 they would all know. It might startle Gussy and do her harm. Mother did not wish her to go with father unless mother herself was of the party, but father would have his way. He came back well pleased, and said he had installed Gussy where she ought to be in her husband's absence in his"], [317, "The American Cousins 305 house, with his mother. Is it so very fine a house, Mr Sheldrake ? \" Sophy interrupted herself to glance round with quick inquisitiveness and a sus picion of disparagement. \" There are a great many books here, almost as many as we have at the Free Library, and in much better binding naturally. I daresay some of them are rare editions, Elzevirs or Aldines,\" Sophy pulled herself together to display with satisfaction a morsel of her desultory know ledge. \" But how bare the roof is, and how little light comes in at these queer old windows. W7hy don't they have modern oriels with plate glass in the frames ? When I came up to the hall door I thought I had never seen such a door, it was like the door to an old jail, battered and clamped with iron. And don't you think the avenue and the park would be greatly improved by having half of the old gnarled falling down trees taken out and nice thriving young fancy trees like those at Daisymead planted in their place ? It would be ever so much more cheerful. Oh, but about our Gussy,\" returning with a bound to her sheep. \" Father had to own she was overdone and not very well, and that was why madam \u2014 Mrs Sheldrake \u2014 proposed to keep her. And then Gussy wrote herself the next morning, so that mother might not fret, that Mrs Sheldrake, who had been as gracious and kind as possible, had asked her to stay at Oakspur for a little change, and she thought it ought to be both her duty aud pleasure to stay.\" \" Well,\" said George, with a smile, \" wasn't she right ? \" \" Oh ! but you don't know Gussy, Mr Shel drake,\" persisted Sophy; \"perhaps she was sick u"], [318, "The American Cousins 306 and wretched and breaking her heart all the time. But she would not let out a word of it ; she would just suffer until she died, because she thought it was due to somebody\u2014 Willie Sheldrake or his mother, or anybody, save herself \u2014 to put up with what she had to bear to the last. She is not like the rest of us ; she is ever so much better and kinder and more unselfish. It is idle for us to say we are none of us half so good ; we are none of us a hundred times so good as Gussy.\" George made no mock of the enthusiastic \u00a9 speaker, quivering with the zeal of her words, as she launched out on the perfections of the object of the strongest attachment of the girlish life. He thought of what he had read of the cruel jealousies and fierce rivalries of sisters, and even when they did not thus sin against the blood which flowed from a common source in their veins, of the petty squabbles and ignoble strifes prevail ing between members of the same family. He told himself that his cousins, Mary and Elizabeth, though they were good women, though they treated each other with scrupulous fairness and courtesy and a fair measure of sisterly regard, did not love each other with a pure heart fervently as these Coringham girls had loved each other. In the meantime Sophy was still making him her father-confessor. She had some faith in him, it seemed, though he was an old fogey to a little girl like her, and she had by fits and starts resented his making game of her. \" I thought,\" she said piteously twisting and un twisting her damp rag of a handkerchief, for she had been so idiotic as to provide herself with one"], [319, "The American Cousins 307 of the lace-bordered morsels of cambric which went with her evening dress, and she had just been using it to dry up these irrepressible tears which Mr Sheldrake had forbidden her to shed, \u2014 \" I thought that it would be a grand thing for Gussy to be married, though I always knew I should be fit to die without her. But there would be her house to go to whenever I liked, where I could do what ever I chose, and that it would be fun to help to entertain her visitors. Then it was promotion for Gussy ; it showed how she was valued. But it has all turned out so different from what I ex pected. It is not that Gussy is not as dear and nice as ever, but somehow she does not seem to belong to me now, at least she belongs a great deal more to your cousin,\" and Sophy ended with a sus picious quaver in her voice and a vicious tug which tore the lace of her handkerchief. \" But that is as it should be,\" George hastened to represent. \" You would not have it otherwise ? \" \" No,\" answered Sophy, dubiously, \" but she is always either writing to Willie, or reading bits of his letters, or making preparations for his coming home. She is so busy and taken up that I do not see how I can interrupt her to tell her my stories. Oh, yes, she listens when I talk and she is in terested ; it would not be Gussy if she were not deeply interested in all that happens at Daisymead, but it is always with a reserve, and a double strain upon her, I can see. She loves us as well as ever, but she is not just our Gussy any more. There are no visitors to entertain at Laburnum Lodge, for she has no heart for company, and will not have Coringham people, whom Willie does not"], [320, "77*; American Cousins 308 care for, going about her and he away. There is something taking up father's attention at the foundry, so that mother will not go out or have anybody come to us either. It is dreadfully dull for everybody except Gussy. She was content, even before she came here, because she was taking care of her husband's house, and looking out for him, and having him to think of every minute.\" \" But you have the old folks \u2014 I beg their pardon, your father and mother \u2014 to think of and care for, as I bet they are never done thinking of and car ing for you \u2014 you unconscionable Miss Sophy.\" Sophy opened round eyes. \" They ain't old, Mr Sheldrake, they ain't a bit old, even father is little above fifty and mother is only forty-seven. I don't mean for a moment that they don't care for me, as good parents care for their children, far before anything I deserve, but they don't particu larly want me because they have each other. Father has mother and mother has father, and now they are always walking away together or bidding me go and practise, or give out the tea, or take a run with Duke, just that they may have an unin terrupted conversation. I daresay you will think it silly of me, Mr Sheldrake, and you will laugh at me for feeling it rather hard to be left out in the cold, but y7ou see I used to have Gussy to listen to everything I had to say, and to think no end of whatever concerned me, since my concerns were her concerns. But now Gussy has Willie, and mother has father, while I have nobody.\" And again Sophy's warm, hurt heart grew too big for her complete control. \" Poor little thing ! \" said George, under his"], [321, "The American Cousins 309 breath, with positive tenderness. He understood the situation better than she imagined. It was not so long since he had practically given up his life-long chum, his boy Beville. There was still something of an aching void in the region where that young gentleman had been formerly content to reign supreme. Aloud George remarked cheerfully, with a furtive glance at the timepiece, \" It will not be always so : and your sister and you must have parted some day, certainly you must have done so when you went out to America, if you had not before. You must tell me what you think of that fine idea, Miss Sophy ? I can tell you I like it.\" She stared back at him in startled amazement. Then as she stared her frankly questioning eyes fell before his, till the long lashes shaded the rounded rosy cheeks, the scarlet of which mounted in a swift flame to her white temples. It flashed upon him that Elias and Mrs Whitelaw had not thought fit, up to this moment, to impart their project of migration to Sophy, who was but a chit of a girl in their eyes. Thus his reference to America, without a key to his meaning, could only have struck her in one light, as it might have struck the least self-conscious, the least conceited, the most modest of girls. She must think he was allud ing to a wish to take her out with him as his wife \u2014 a wish of the fulfilment of which he was so cer tain that he could allude to it in this free and easy manner, almost as if it were an accomplished fact. He grew as fiery red as Sophy, while he sprang to his feet with a suppressed groan. What would happen next ? It was a mess. Was he at liberty"], [322, "The American Cousins 310 to divulge what Elias contemplated, and explain what he\u2014 George \u2014 had intended by Sophy's going to America? WTould it be an insult to her to imply that his words and her reception of them called for an explanation. Columbus ! what must she think of him for speaking as if he were sure of her acceptance of a matrimonial proposal from him, for delicately mentioning it as \" that fine idea.\" Why the mere circumstance of his having taken advantage of the girl's being there owing to her girlish thoughtlessness, her trust in him and the trouble she was in \u2014 however gratuitous \u2014 about her sister, to broach such a suggestion, in such a fashion, came home to him as a piece of cold blooded impertinence. If he had heard of it in any other man in similiar circumstances he would have felt the strongest inclination to punch that fellow's head. And there Sophy sat in his favourite lounge near one of the library windows, in sweet girlish confusion and affright ! \u00a9 \u00a9 Her nimble woman's wits recovered sooner than his did from the shock. She took the initiative with a mingled resolution and embarrassment which even at the time made an impression upon him as wonderfully womanly. It showed a pretty premature womanliness in quickness of resource, readiness of action, and a dawning power of judg ment \u2014 the moment there was an urgent demand for the qualities. \" I think I must go without waiting any longer to see my sister. I am quite rested. Oh ! no, I do not require refreshments, I could not eat them if they were brought. I have no more time to spare. Please, Mr Sheldrake, will you tell Gussy with my"], [323, "The American Cousins 311 best love, I was very glad to hear she was well enough to be out driving and was quite happy. I shall not be long of seeing her. I daresay she will be coming back to Laburnum Lodge presently. I know my way to the station perfectly well ; I am more puzzled to get my way out of the house, it is so dark and there are so many odd turns and little stairs. If you will see me safely to the hall it will be quite enough. I shall get along best by myself after that, for I must hurry as fast as I can, since father and mother do not know where I am. You see,\" went on Sophy, unable to resist being confidential in the middle of her flurried dignity, \" they are from home for the greater part of the day. Mother has gone with father a good many miles in the Stapleton direction in order to see an old friend of father's whom he wished to consult about something. It came into my head, when I was all by myself, that I might slip out and go right off to Gussy's, see for myself how she was feeling, and get back without anybody's being the wiser. That is to say, I meant of course to tell father and mother all about having been at Oak spur, when they return to-night, but then it would be too late for them to prevent my going,\" finished Sophy with the utmost naivete. \" I should have seen Gussy if it had not been for the unfortunate accident of her being out, which I could not antici pate ; I took the precaution of asking for j7ou first, that you might tell her I was here without alarm ing her.\" This was the climax. It looked as if Sophy W7hitelaw had been guilty of an elopement and had taken refuge with him ! The mere fancy"], [324, "The American Cousins 312 sent the blood tingling through his veins. The additional reflection that it was for him to inter pose and protect her from further mis-adven ture as the consequences of her escapade, caused a fresh thrill \u2014 an entirely novel sensation \u2014 to his seasoned, case-hardened bachelor heart. \" No, Sophy,\" he said, with a grim kindness which robbed the use of her Christian name of any savour of undue familiarity, \"you must not do as you propose. I am a great deal older and wiser than you, and you must allow me to arrange for you. I see my cousin Elizabeth and my brother turning into the drive by the side way from the wicket opening into Crab-tree Lane, you must stay till they are here. You can easily wait longer till your sister comes in. I can send a telegram for your father and mother to find, letting them know you are with your sister. But if you must fly off right away \u2014 we \u2014 I can speak for the others \u2014 will escort you to the station and put you into your train.\" \" But I do not know Miss Elizabeth Sheldrake,\" objected Sophy, blushing again furiously with a newly-born, shame-faced comprehension caught quickly from his manner \u2014 studiously respectful as it was in its friendliness \u2014 that she had done some thing foolish and indiscreet which he was trying to smooth down and explain away. \"She may not be pleased to see me,\" urged Sophy, seized with a sudden fit of uncontrollable shyness ; \" I only came to ask after Gussy, and I knew you and thought you would help me.\" She was on her mettle now, and steadied her voice as she spoke. \" So I am helping you in the best way I can,\""], [325, "The American Cousins 313 asserted George, gruffly, while essaying to speak lightly. \" Do let me go before they come, Mr Sheldrake,\" beseechingly. \" No, I won't,\" refused George, more in his natural manner, as he recognised that she had sufficient sense to submit to his guidance. \" If I am behaving like a grizzly bear from the Rockies you have yourself to thank for it. And if you do not know my cousin Betsy, you ought to, that is all I have to say. Since her brother has married your sister, and she is going to marry my brother, we should all be as thick together as pop-corns. I don't say she has been dying to know you beforehand, but she'll be mighty agreeable \u2014 see if she won't, now that the time is come. I'll introduce you ; I'm getting on real fast \u2014 a stickler for etiquette the one moment, and a master of the ceremonies the next.\" Then George flung open the library window nearest him, hailed the newcomers, calling out that Miss Sophy Whitelaw was within. She had arrived expressly to inquire for her sister, but, as her time was up and she scouted the mention of afternoon tea, he suggested that they should go in a body with her to the station and see her into the train. Elizabeth was taken by surprise \u2014 mystified, yet not without a suspicion that there was something behind his words ; but, as he had pledged himself, there was no fault to find with her courtesy. Recent events had subdued and softened her, had rendered her disposed to make the best of every thing. Moreover, she knew that having acknow-"], [326, "The American Cousins 314 ledged Gussy, they must also acknowledge that sister of Gussy's who, like Elizabeth herself, would soon be beyond Warwickshire standards. Yes, that was another consideration ; she would soon be out of it all so far as it related to Oakspur and its circle. Elizabeth Sheldrake of Oakspur, and Elizabeth Sheldrake, soon to be the wife of a Virginian planter, were already different beings, ruled by different laws. Elizabeth did not find Sophy so unobjectionable as Gussy. The critic could pull Sophy to pieces, and even sit upon her a little because her good- ness and sweetness were not so large an element in her composition as to eclipse every other consideration. But the judge was willing to ad- mit the girl was a pretty, fresh, bright-looking young creature, prettier and brighter than her sister could ever have been. Sophy Whitelaw might be teachable though she was not good style \u2014 witness that smart costume and a manner half stupidly shy, half spasmodically confident \u2014 still, certainly she must be fond of her sister, else she would not have come over from Cor- ingham to discover for herself how Gussy did, and get a passing glimpse of her. It seemed a pity that they should not see each other; but Mrs Sheldrake might be put out by the intrusion, and the hard-won harmony of the last few days might be fatally disturbed. Therefore Elizabeth acquiesced gracefully enough in George's sugges tion, to Beville's half-affronted admiration, and she and the brothers forthwith accompanied Sophy amicably to the station, and parted with her at the door of her carriage."], [327, "315 CHAPTER XXI THE OLIVE BRANCH ACCEPTED Willie Sheldrake arrived from America the following day and came directly home to Oakspur in obedience to Elizabeth's summons and to seek his wife. It was the queerest thing in the world to see how coolly he took everything, and how easily he resumed his place as a matter of course. He who had been at the bottom of the mischief, who had been the author of the discord, was the least put out of any in returning to his former position. No doubt he was the young squire. He walked with his hands in his pockets across the lawn and wondered why his mother had allowed Symonds to get the turf so full of sorrel ; or strolled in from the stables and an nounced there must be new corn bins and another horse-box presently; or sat down at the foot of the dinner- table, and when the soup was not seasoned altogether to his mind, hoped cook had not got into bad habits. It was all as if he had not been gone, and that with everybody's con sent, for more than a day. It would have been intolerable insolence and lack of feeling if it"], [328, "The American Cousins 316 had not all been so unconscious \u2014 so simple, so devoid of a double meaning. The lawn, the stables, the table, were nominally Willie's property ; but he was equally unabashed when he offered his mother his arm to take her to the drawing-room, put her footstool into place, and sought to induce her to avail herself of a break between the April showers to venture on a turn with him along the terrace. Everything was done as a matter of course, as with a con science void of offence. Mrs Sheldrake was nervous, a strange thing with her till recently. Young Mrs Sheldrake was on the watch, evidently intently bent on preserving peace. Mary and Elizabeth at the last, do what they would, were constrained in manner. Even Dorothy and Eleanor were omin ously quiet and demure. The American Sheldrakes felt under the awkward obligation of making con versation in order to cover discrepancies in the family intercourse. And all the time the brothers felt their familiar presence there, the privileges which had been accorded to them so long as they were the only men at Oakspur, and after Beville had been received as Elizabeth's accepted suitor, must be a shock and scandal to Willie Sheldrake. But Willie, the prime disturber of the whole domestic economy, did not seem to see anything, appeared to have forgotten everything, was totally unmoved. He did not even show any astonishment or overwhelming gratitude at discovering his wife at Oakspur. She was bashful in her happiness, but he was not bashful. He was unaffectedly glad"], [329, "The American Cousins 317 to be with her again, as might have been expected in one of a devotedly attached young pair, whose first year of wedlock was not expired, yet who had been far parted for a dreary period of many weeks. He began at once, and without disguise, to claim her company, and entire interest and care \u2014 in a manner of which his mother was inclined to dis approve. He did not mind that, however, he looked as if he rather liked it while he could still have his own way. He did not hesitate to display his pleasure in introducing her to his old surround ings, his favourite haunts, as if he had never done anything to forfeit them, as if Gussy had been born and bred to share them. It would seem as if Willie Sheldrake was sustained and panoplied by some strong conscious ness of pure motive and high intent ; as if he was a veritable reformer in the raw, the pioneer of a farther reaching Christian civilisation and humani- \u00a9 tarianism. But if so he had become convinced that his methods had been wrong. He must intend to pursue his plans for the benefit of his fellows on different lines thenceforth, lines \u2014 new or old \u2014 most probably borrowed from, and modelled on the collective wisdom of long generations. His fathers were not altogether fools, their arguments were not wholly mistaken. He had been in the country of advanced views and wide elbow-room, in a re public where every man might hold his own theories, maintain his own practice, and rise from the humblest to the highest station unbaulked. Willie Sheldrake declared the sight had inspired him with the greatest respect. Yet he returned much less of a violent radical, with more of"], [330, "The American Cousins 318 a retrograde swing of the pendulum towards moderate liberalism than when he had quitted England. Was it because the conviction had come O to him that all political theories were but theories after all, and were like the scientific discoveries represented in Albert Durer's great picture. They might make life less rough and painful to the material part of man, they might render him in finitely richer by the gratification of his senses and his feelings in a measure, but as far as political theory or scientific invention went, in the light of a panacea for the universal shadow of failure and death, Melancholia must still sit poppy crowned, her head on her hand, her heart breaking for the futility of men's most splendid schemes, their most glorious discoveries. For \u2014 :< It's only God you may have if you may ; \" ;' It's only Heaven you'll get for the asking.\" Only Heaven's lofty morality, only God's divine law kept by God's divine strength given to His creatures, will bring a millennium. Willie tacitly consented to fill again his natural place and discharge his original obligations. There was no more talk of his establishing himself as a born master-mechanic, the friend and ally of all the craftsmen in Coringham. There, indeed, any chance of his entering into partnership with his father-in-law would come to an end with Elias's transference of himself and his business to the most desperately energetic, most go-a-head country in the world. Willie did not touch a saw or a chisel or draw a plan or drop a word which had to do with a model"], [331, "The American Cousins 319 during these early days of restored family union. He was ready to ride with Elizabeth and Beville, or to fish with George, or to accompany his mother and Gussy in their drives, or at his mother's request to meet the agent and inspect in his company farm leases and farm offices, new-laid drains and partially thinned plantations. He was like the Willie of his late school and early college days before he was transformed and whirled away by a very tornado of democracy. He evaded the discussion of politics. He was shy \u2014 the only time he was shy \u2014 when he was asked for his opinion, and gave it so shortly that it sounded more like an epigram than an opinion. He did blush faintly when the talk skirted the fantastic dreams of Utopias, or the mock heroism of a Laurence Oliphant gathering strawberries for sale at the bidding of a false prophet. Gussy did not blush at such malapropos allusions. She held her head high because of what her squire had tried to do for working men and women. He might come to regard his small attempt at com munism as a piece of boyish folly. But she would be proud to the day of her death that Willie in his youth had thought of something beyond game \u2014 big or little, something beyond even elections, maiden speeches and a post under government. The furniture of Laburnum Lodge was to be sold and the house let immediately. Mr and Mrs William Sheldrake had no need for them when their place was at Oakspur, where Mrs Sheldrake, senior, had consented to remain with her son and his wife, and to dwell \u2014 she with them, or they with her \u2014 as politeness disputed the pas. There was one thing"], [332, "77^ American Cousins 320 on which Mrs Sheldrake held a fixed opinion. Gussy should at once take the head of her hus band's table and act as the mistress of the estab lishment. If she had a great deal to learn, the sooner she began the better. It was Mrs Shel drake's determination to abdicate of her own free will in favour of her daughter-in-law, while the pulses of the elder woman were merely slowing and her vigour but diminishing, with the dignity and pathos which only a voluntary abdication con fers. It was rendered immeasurably easier by Gussy's unfeigned reluctance to accept the offering made at her shrine \u2014 a reluctance finally conquered by two things, by the strength and steadfastness of Mrs Sheldrake's purpose, and by the younger woman's natural wisdom. The new order of affairs would not affect Elizabeth, the preparations for whose wedding and departure were at last going on apace. Gussy's gentle sway would not be unacceptable to the younger girls, who had elected themselves her partisans ; it would fall hardest on Mary7, who was considerably the bride's senior. But Mary Sheldrake was worthy and well principled after her fashion. She could accommodate herself without more than a wry face and a blundering, disconcerting word on occasions, to what she knew ought to be. She did not dislike Gussy personally, after Mary came to know her, and felt sure of her co-operation in parish work. Mary was sensible that she got more of her own way, and was allowed to dictate more in her brother's house than would have happened in the case of most sisters-in-law, nay, than had"], [333, "The American Cousins 321 happened under her mother's regime. Moreover, Mary herself, with her handsome portion, was likely to marry eventually some aspiring curate or prudent rector. All that had been a source of unhappiness and division in the family settled itself so naturally, easily and happily, that the reverse looked like a bad dream which was past and gone. In consequence of Mrs Sheldrake's semi-invalid condition, there had been no further demonstra tion between her and the heads of the house of Whitelaw than was summed up in the exchange of formal calls of amnesty. Mrs Whitelaw, in a flutter of lace, riband and finest of home cashmeres, had the honour of receiving the great lady, Gussy's mother-in-law, one day, and on another after a due interval, Mrs Whitelaw returned the visit in such a costume \u2014 cleverly adapted to an increase of age and stoutness \u2014 as that which Sophy had worn in her descent on Oakspur. Mrs Whitelaw saw Oakspur, Gussy's husband's country seat, of which Gussy was already proclaimed mistress, and did not die of the impression it made. Mrs Whitelaw had seen it often before at a respect ful distance, but only now near at hand. She went prepared to be struck, enraptured, and she came away like Sophy, lifting her eyebrows and feeling slightly supercilious. The manor house and park were five times the size of Daisymead and its grounds, but Oakspur was gloomy and dingy. It was clear it had few modern improvements within and without. If it had not been her daughter's through her husband, and through that husband x"], [334, "77^ American Cousins 322 if it had not belonged to many generations of Sheldrakes, Mrs Whitelaw would have raised her eyebrows still higher and would have been tempted to class Oakspur as a musty, fusty, ill- ventilated, ill-lit half ruin. Rather Gussy than she make it her dwelling-place; Mrs Whitelaw would have instituted no comparison between Oakspur and Daisymead if it had been her happy fate to abide at her bright-burnished, tricked-out villa, with its innumerable contrivances for comfort and enjoy ment. Nevertheless, Mrs Worsley would never have heard the last of that solitary visit of Mrs Whitelaw's to Oakspur, and of Mrs William Shel drake's footmen and coachman, her park and her carriage, if there had not come a limit to Mrs Whitelaw's stay in Coringham. Willie Sheldrake was a courteous and attentive host the instant he ceased to be absent-minded. In his college he had earned the reputation of being \" cranky,\" not of being churlish and inhos pitable. He had taken to his American cousins from the first day he saw them, when they had penetrated to his den in the mechanics' quarters of Coringham. He forgave them for having pene trated there. He bore them no grudge for having all but dispossessed him of his inheritance \u2014 for that matter, when all was said and done, poor Willie had never fully realised the possibility of his being dispossessed. Anyhow, he freed them from all blame in the business, and he was pleased that his sister Elizabeth should marry Beville. Altogether Willie Sheldrake, in spite of his flights and eccentricities which were in a fair way to calm down, was neither little-minded nor little-hearted."], [335, "77^ American Cousins 323 Nobody rejoiced more in the return of the so called prodigal, and in the establishment of his wife at Oakspur, than did dear, kindly, incon sistent Lady Thorndale, who had likened Willie to the reprobate brother of her youth, and had strongly advised the paying off and the expatria tion of him and his, for the term of their lives. She came at once to Oakspur, as she had done on a former and quite opposite occasion, for the express purpose of backing up Mrs Sheldrake and en couraging her in the course she had adopted. \" I am so glad that the foolish outcry has blown over and that my friend Willie's escapades are con doned. I believe they were never half so bad as they were called. Thorndale tells me so, and he says women will exaggerate and get up storms in teacups. Yet I've a notion he expressed himself as strongly as anybody, and made quite a fuss over Willie's being a radical or a socialist, or something of the kind. But now he says he never saw a young man so improved in so short a time : he has grown quite rational and companionable. As for myself, I assure you I have had great pleasure in being introduced to Mrs Willie. I can say with perfect sincerity that I never saw a nicer young girl or one with prettier manners, quite simple and natural, not a particle of under bred pretence or affectation. She might have been the daughter of any one of us. I declare I should have been glad to have had her. Willie's taste has not been in fault, in fact he has shown infinitely better judgment and feeling in his choice, than some of our young men display.

Mrs Willie is a credit to her people, whoever they are. And there, you fortunate woman ! you are getting rid of the whole set, since the Coringham connection might have been awkward if they had remained in England. Of course we shall be sorry to lose our belle, Elizabeth, but she is getting an excellent parti, and a Prince Charming to boot. The voyage to America is nothing, absolutely nothing now-a-days. She will be coming over every season to see her old friends. Why7, Thorn- dale has been twice in America within the last fifteen years. He bought land there, and he likes to take a look at his investment. I might have accompanied him the last time, since I had just married Geraldine, if I had not been such a shockingly bad sailor. But I daresay if I had been Elizabeth's age and in her circumstances, I should not have thought twice of running the risk.\" With Lady Thorndale on Mrs Willie's side, Mrs Sheldrake and Mary could afford to defy the malicious wit of the Kershaw tribe."], [337, "325 CHAPTER XXII \"I'VE BEEN AND GONE AND DONE IT\" For the better part of a week after Sophy's call on him in the library at Oakspur, George Shel drake exhibited himself in a remarkably unsocial mood. He was constantly separating himself from the others in order to go his own way and think his own thoughts. He turned his back on his former cronies, Dorothy and Eleanor, who asked each other, in amazement and discontent, what could have come over him. He could not keep his mind from dwelling on his interview with Sophy, though he told himself he might have been better employed in designing his tombstone, seeing that he was ever so much older than Beville and as good as twice the age of the little girl in question. What the hang did he say which she could have so misunderstood, as it was horribly clear to him that she had misunderstood him ? Yet he would take his oath that, unsophisticated, rash and headstrong though Sophy might be \u2014 without the tact and dis crimination which, in the absence of other qualities, stand the caste of Vere de Vere in good stead \u2014 she was the soul of modesty and womanly self-respect, which must have been grievously wounded and"], [338, "77^ American Cousins 326 offended, in the first place, by what she must have thought his ill-timed, horribly-worded addresses. He could not recall the exact phrases each had used, the only conclusion which stuck fast to him was that, as Sophy had certainly not yet heard of her father's intention to settle in America, she had naturally enough imagined that he meant her going there to be in the character of his wife. What a self-sufficient, blustering beggar she must have taken him to try to speak to her in that way, in the circumstances, with no consideration for her youth and inexperience, for the dilemma in which her affection for her sister, her dauntless ness, her youthful disdain of appearances had placed her. The parting from the sister in whom Sophy had an innocently profound faith, of whom she was passionately fond, thus showing fine capacities for trust and tenderness, would be a wrench. But it must be faced, as George had told her, under what ever conditions, if Elias Whitelaw went to the States with his wife and unmarried daughter, while Gussy settled with her husband and his family at Oak spur. Was there no question of compensation and substitution of a new love for an old ? Sophy had been startled and disturbed by that unlucky speech of his which she had misconstrued, but had she been mortally offended ? Was there any advocate pleading for him in addition to the girlish dignity which felt secure of itself, which declined to be taken advantage of, and in equal measure refused to be reduced to angry, tearful protest ? Could the little girl have learnt to care a trifle for him \u2014 a dry-haired, odd fellow, in these"], [339, "The American Cousins 327 months when they had often laughed and sparred together, waging a jesting warfare, spiced with light scoff and scorn, instead of meeting each other with suave deference and well-turned compliment ? Was there a shade of sweet coyness rather than of sharp disgust, in her determined turning away from him, her ignoring of his suggestion\u2014imperti nent as it might well have sounded to her, her declining to answer it even by a single resentful word ? Was he hurting her again while he thus stayed away from Coringham, hurting her in a far more sensitive and vital quarter than that of morti fied girlish pride ? He would not hurt her in such a manner for the whole world. Poor brusque, affectionate little Sophy ! He would rather tell her what he began to believe was the truth, that he could not go back to America or live without her. George was absent for a day in Coringham, and when he came back he was still curiously pre occupied. He said nothing to explain either his absence or his self-engrossment, at first, unless the explanation was contained in the enigmatical sentence delivered with some excitement and still more cheerfulness to Beville : \u2014 \" Wall, Obadiah, I've been and gone and done it at last, I'm a gone coon from this day.\" \" What have you been and gone and done, you strange animal ? \" Beville challenged him airily in reply. \" Have you written a book or bought a hunter, or invested in sham antiques ? be certain they are sham if you were so cautious and yet did not consult Elizabeth or me about it.

But for a gone coon, you look uncommonly jolly and puffed up.\" \" Sakes ! lad, it is little you know about it.\" The party were assembled at dinner, it was a strictly family party, even the servants were gone. Nobody expected a bomb-shell to be flung into the midst of them in the shape of a totally unexpected and electrifying piece of news. \" Ladies and gentlemen,\" George in his slightly nasal and rasping voice broke in on a momentary silence, rising to his feet and causing everybody to look towards him in surprised expectation, \" I have to beg your congratulations, and I guess I had better ask them in a body to save time and waste of breath. I have this very day plucked up courage to ask sister Sophy \u2014 Miss Sophy White law\u2014to be my wife, and she has been so good as to give her consent. Mr and Mrs Elias Whitelaw are also agreeable, so that the nail is as good as hit on the head, and there is nothing left to be done in the meantime save for you all to wish us long life and prosperity, which I'm sure and certain you will be ready and willing to do.\" \"I \u2014 I don't quite understand,\" said poor Mrs Sheldrake, whose naturally slow comprehension had not been quickened by her illness, \" but,\" taking up her glass, \" I am ready to drink your health and that of your future wife \u2014 I did not quite catch the name \u2014 when you wish it, Mr George.\" She had never got beyond the \" Mr George \" ; it was with difficulty that she had brought herself to address his brother as \" Beville.\" A chorus of exclamations was going round the"], [341, "77 \u00a3 American Cousins 329 table. \"Sophy!\" from Gussy. \"That girl!\" from Mary, hardly under her breath. \" You're joking, George,\" from the astounded Beville. \"Not I, Bev,\" retorted George, \"a hugely bad joke it would be ! How could you imagine I should be guilty of it ? \" \" Oh, Dorothy ! \" from Eleanor. \" Oh, Eleanor ! \" from Dorothy. Only Gussy cried a little with pride and joy that her Sophy should be thus early distinguished by a good and honourable man's regard which she had been able to return \u2014 that she should be on the way to be as happy a young bride as she her self was. The duty of responding to George's informal announcement and of proposing forthwith the toast he had requested devolved really on Willie, the master of the house, and he acquitted himself well on the occasion. \" We have to thank you first, cousin George, for your delightful bit of news. I \u2014 we,\" and he looked affectionately at Gussy, for her hearty approval, and then glanced courteously round the rest of the circle, taking their acquiescence as a matter of course, \" are very glad that sister Sophy has done you \u2014 and all of us, the favour to answer ' yes ' to your question.

With all our hearts we wish you every good thing you can desire.\" George thanked the company in his queer way. \"You see,\" he said, once more taking in all the company at a glance and appealing to them en masse with perfect gravity, \" Miss Sheldrake, and all of you, this here child was kinder ashamed of his younger brother getting before him as Bev was doing. I was always the boss at home, and the boss should take the lead.\" Elizabeth felt as if the ground had slipped from beneath her feet for a second time. She had given up Oakspur freely at last, and presently her heart had turned to the old family mansion in Virginia. A primitive log-house to begin with, the foundation of which had been laid by Humphrey Sheldrake fresh from the Oakspur of his day, where succeeding generations of American Shel drakes had lived their lives and been happy or sorry with the manifold joys and woes of humanity till death took them, where George and Beville had first seen the light. But George, as the elder brother, had inherited that Virginian Oakspur, and there, instead of installing Elizabeth Sheldrake, he would install Sophy Whitelaw, the Coringham girl \u2014 half a dozen years Elizabeth's junior \u2014 to reign queen, while Elizabeth and Beville must depart to"], [343, "The American Cousins 331 Uncle Mosey's brand new encampment in Florida, or must build a still newer house elsewhere. But Elizabeth had not forgotten her lesson ; she looked at Gussy with her sweet smile be ginning to sparkle through her tears at her sister's promotion. She thought of young Sophy as pretty and bright a creature as Elizabeth had ever seen even in her fine out-of-place frock, and in the confusion of the scrape into which she had got herself. Why should not Sophy have the precedence which belonged to the wife of the elder brother ? Smart costumes ought to go down tolerably well in America, the land of \" Fair Barbarians,\" who thought nothing of wearing satin and diamonds of a morning and sporting them in a cottage garden. Coringham manners might not be amiss in America, especi ally when the manners were those of a pretty clever young woman. At that point Elizabeth stopped short and called herself to account. She told herself the manners were also those of a warm-hearted girl, a girl belonging to the house hold out of which Gussy had come \u2014 Gussy, who had such a refinement of pure goodness about her that every candid person who had any good in him or her must confess that Gussy's manners would pass in a palace. And oh ! would it not be a comfort to have a Warwickshire girl within hail, when both were far away from Warwick shire ? To talk of the Avon and the Learn, when everybody else was speaking or singing of the Potomac and the Ohio ; to recall the oak, the beech and the thorn, when bananas, orange trees and sumachs were so much more en evidence."], [344, "The American Cousins 332 Elizabeth could meet the alarmed, anxious questioning of Beville's eyes with a look of cheer ful re-assurance. When she could speak apart with him she was able to say, \" It is all right, Beville. George will have the prettiest young creature for his wife ; you remember how pretty she looked in spite of her finery ? She seems so quick, she will soon recognise the exact worth of smartness and where it is out of keep ing. What is much more to the purpose, I am sure she is good and kind, and will make your old George happy. Oh, my dear, what does any thing else signify compared to those essentials ? \" Mary7 was the most indignant. For George Sheldrake to marry that girl, another Coringham girl, without even the excuse of her being a great heiress and him a needy fortune-hunter, was incon ceivable and inexcusable. Gussy was well enough, and she was one of themselves now, but George was forewarned and forearmed. George's cousin Willie's example, together with the discord only lately healed which had been the consequence of Willie's folly, ought to have served as a warning and an arming. To fall into the very same pit was such a lamentable weakness, as only a man not a boy \u2014 a man come to the years of discretion and possessed of sufficient cleverness to make him think himself entitled to be eccentric \u2014 could be guilty. Now Mary \u2014 though she appeared sometimes to be of the same mind as George, and though she had felt flattered by his usually abstaining from scandalising her with his Yankeeisms as he abstained from scandalising her mother \u2014"], [345, "The American Cousins 333 had repeatedly made loud and ostentatious declara tions that nothing in existence would induce her to marry an American or to go to America with him. She had wondered greatly how Elizabeth, in the face of her long muddling and messing in antiquarian and arch\u00e6ological tastes and hobbies \u2014 culminating in these Sheldrake papers \u2014 could bring herself to take a step so reactionary \u2014 Mary might say revolutionary. So there did not seem reasonable ground for the eldest sister's wrath. The Sheldrakes' connections and friends in America were Elizabeth's business, not Mary's. It would be hard if George Sheldrake could not take out an English wife with him as Beville was about to do, because Mary Sheldrake would have nought of an American for a husband \u2014 of America for an adopted country. Considering his disadvantage in that respect, George might even have been commended for flying low in his matrimonial choice. Mary's conduct did bear an awkward resemblance to the behaviour of the fox when the grapes were beyond puss's reach. \"Ah! Dorothy,\" and \"Oh, Eleanor!\" the pair looked into each other's abashed, crushed faces. Then they stole away together, linked arm in arm, and made their outcry. \" We have been abominably used,\" said Eleanor ; \"we have been disgracefully jilted, both of us.\" \" Well, I don't know about being jilted,\" said Dorothy, who had a less lively imagination and was more particular about facts. \" It is horrible of cousin George to fail us both, and to care for another girl, but if he never said anything \u2014 of the kind, I mean, if he never so much as men-"], [346, "The American Cousins 334 tioned the word marriage to either of us, can we say he jilted us ? \" \" Dorothy ! \" Eleanor turned upon her sister solemnly, \"if we are not jilted where are we?

But if we have not really been jilted, we can't pretend it, can we ? That would not be right, would it ? And do you know I am not sure that I even feel my heart is broken, and that I shall never get over it,\" ended Dorothy, doubtfully. \" It has been a great shock to us,\" insisted Eleanor. \" Of course it has,\" Dorothy admitted readily, \" but we would not wish to make mischief with Gussy's sister. Oh ! I wish I had seen her when she was here the other day. I heard them saying she was awfully pretty. Wouldn't you give any thing to have seen the lucky girl who has put us out, whom cousin George prefers to us ? \" re suming rapidly her pensive, sentimental strain. \" No, I shouldn't,\" retorted Eleanor, tartly. \" What is there to see about her ? a nasty, under-bred, dressed-up, Coringham girl.\" \" Oh, hush, Nell,\" implored the more pacific Dorothy, \"after W7illie has gone and married a Coringham girl, and this other girl is her sister.\" \" I don't care,\" the incorrigible Eleanor asserted"], [347, "77^ American Cousins 335 stoutly, \" I don't mind Gussy, she's Willie's wife and she's very good-natured ; she isn't dressed up, and I have not found her out dropping her h's. I have heard mother say Gussy gives way too much to everybody, but that is better than always asserting herself and constantly remind ing us that she is mistress here, even with mother in the house. But one Coringham girl is surely enough ; and the second must be a mean, forward thing who has thrown herself at George's head.\" The girls made up their minds in the end to be reproachfully cool and distant in their manner to George. But they altered their tone when they discovered how much cooler Mary was, and with what disdainful asperity she spoke \u2014 vaguely, it is true, but quite comprehensibly to anyone who chose to take her up \u2014 of trade and manufactur ing towns, of their inferior society, of the defec tive often distorted standards of common middle class girls. Eleanor and Dorothy's hearts sprang back to their old allegiance at a bound. The owners of the hearts deserted to the opposite side on the spot. Cousin George was free to do as he liked, and to choose his wife where he would. What right had Mary to interfere ? They were quite certain Gussy's sister was a great deal better looking and better mannered than Mary, who, between themselves, was so stout and red-faced for her age, decidedly vulgar and common-look ing, especially when she was in full dress. She could not help it, poor thing! nobody could help being stout and red - faced, but she could"], [348, "336 The American Cousins help being rude and unkind, paining poor dear Gussy and affronting Willie. She seemed only to be amusing cousin George, which was a com fort, but he might be dissembling his feelings. Anyhow, Mary ought not to do it, and her younger sisters would act in an entirely different manner. They would show cousin George and the world what magnanimity and dignity meant. The girls would take Gussy's sister by the hand, as Elizabeth who, to be sure, was going to be really her sister, was doing, pat her on the back and make much of her."], [349, "CHAPTER XXIII THE PLAY Mrs Elias Whitelaw had her reward. She had eagerly promoted Gussy's marriage in the erron eous belief that she was thus opening up the county to the Whitelaws, that she would be at least able to witness and to report on Gussy's exalted position as the wife of a squire. Yet the faithful woman was willing to leave her pleasant tent of Daisymead unpitched, and to follow her Elias's wandering footsteps to the ends of the earth, where she would be out of sight and sound of Gussy's dignities and the amenities of her new life. The catastrophe which had followed Mrs White law's ambitious dreams was sufficient in itself to make her accept the changed state of affairs. Nay, she shared the mixture of parental self-abnegation and roused enterprise which induced Elias to emigrate to America and acquire his pile there.

Not only Y"], [350, "338 The American Cousins had Gussy7 married the squire of Oakspur, where her mother could never have been at home, but Gussy's sister whom her father and mother had always treated as a mere chit of a girl, little better than a school-girl, was on the point of accomplish ing a marriage \u2014 actually more brilliant, which would not include any separation from her family. It was with a man who no more despised trade and mechanics than Elias despised them, who had positively allured and enticed the said Elias into becoming Mr George Sheldrake's neighbour in America. The continent was a wide word, but at least it was not cut in two by an Atlantic Ocean. Mrs Whitelaw, like Mrs Bennet in \" Pride and Prejudice,\" was to have two daughters instead of one grandly married, and both were not to be lost to her. And Sophy was so young, and Mr George Sheldrake was the elder brother of Mr Beville, whom Miss Elizabeth Sheldrake did not think it beneath her to marry. Mr George Sheldrake had a place in Virginia \u2014 no doubt a far finer place than Oakspur \u2014 and uncountable dollars. And there were no longer black slaves in the Southern States with whose slavery a woman like Mrs Worsley might twit the mother-in-law of a planter. What would Mrs Worsley say to it all ? Was it not compensation for having to quit Coringham and cross the Atlantic, a step to which in its primitive features Mrs Whitelaw had no more inclination than was felt by her aristocratic country-woman Lady Thorndale ?

As a boy he conned his horn-book and played his games going to and from the grey grammar school of which his memory is the abiding glory.

As a lad he sped along the field path to Shottery to greet Anne Hathaway.

The very plays which were now being acted so lovingly and carefully with all the best accessories which art, in the persons of the trained actor and actress, the scene-painter, the scene-shifter, the dresser, could supply, had been first played in open air circuses and barns by male performers who ranted as badly in the men's parts as in the women's. A single fragment of rock stood for a mountain, a handful of rushes for a wilderness, a couple of branches of fir trees placed saltire ways for a tangled forest. Possibly the company was as interested and en thusiastic as when in the old days it consisted of a sprinkling of court gallants, who invaded the very stage and had their seats there. It included the frequenters of the nearest taverns, and all the idle apprentices who could escape from the eyes of their masters. It numbered a solid burgher or two unable to resist a tendency to frivolity, with their wives and daughters kept well within bounds \u2014 bidden draw their hoods close round their faces and not applaud too conspicuously, neither gig gling at a fool's wit, nor screaming when a man was stabbed, nor whimpering when he was carried to his burial. But none could deny that the present gathering was of a more varied and representative character. There was the whole town flocking proudly to show their appreciation of their own unapproach able townsman. There were masters and men with their womankind from Coringham and other trade centres. There was the intellectual flower of the"], [353, "The American Cousins 341 neighbouring gentry from the country houses round, forgetting caste in the necessity of re- membering the man who with his pen for a sword distanced all competitors, the hero common above all to England and to Warwickshire. There were Londoners by the score, players and playwrights like himself, come to celebrate the apotheosis of the mighty player. There were erudite Germans bent on furnishing a fresh context to, and commentary on, every drama. There were Americans (where are there not Americans ?) proclaiming that Shake- speare belonged to them quite as much as to pro- vincial islanders. If he were alive to-day it would be New York and Chicago, the blue grass plains and the great lakes he would choose for the scenes of his plays and not tame, trumpery little England, or bleak little Scotland, or stale Rome, or plague ridden Egypt. The American cousins who only7 uttered such heresy in blithe jests were there, with a judicious selection of Sheldrakes and Whitelaws brought together for the first, possibly for the last, time in public, in England in the vicinity of Oakspur, calmly facing, because they could afford to face, the gibes and sneers of the Kershaw crew. Mrs Sheldrake and Gussy were perforce absent, Elias was there in spite of the bustle of his approach ing departure, but Mrs Elias in her great content was too modest to put in an appearance in the group.

It was as if the echo of the love sighs and the love laughter which had floated and rung originally over the draw well of Anne Hathaway's home at Shottery must have soughed and tinkled in the air for these three hundred years. \" You and I understood each other rather sooner, George,\" said Sophy, with a roguish twinkle in her eyes, as she watched the flights and flouts of Benedick and Beatrice. \" Guess we did,\" answered George, with a com placent grin. \" But I began by playing a trick upon you.
