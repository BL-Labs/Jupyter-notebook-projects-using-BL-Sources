TERRITORIAL FORTUNES. FARMERS. IMPORTATION OF CEREALS. \u2014 INFLUENCE OF THE LANDLORDS. England, including Wales, is divided into 52 counties, one of which \u2014 Yorkshire \u2014 is subdivided into three districts, called \"Ridings/' In former days the counties were called Shires \u2014 (Shire is an <old Saxon name, signifying division) but the term is now only used in compound words \u2014 as Lancashire, Dorsetshire, &c, signifying the County of Lancaster, of Dorset, and so on. As the fundamental principle of the English Government is to permit everyone to manage his own business as he thinks best, the provincial administration is exclusively local and decentralized. The Government, or rather the Crown, is represented in each county by three functionaries \u2014 the Lord Lieutenant, the High Sheriff, and the Coroner; but their functions being of the military order for the first, and of the judicial kind for the other two, they cannot be considered strictly as Agents for the Government, since the Army and Justice are dependent solely upon the Sovereign. The Lord Lieutenant, nominated by the Queen, commands the Militia of the county, and he is also charged sometimes with the custody of the archives ; in such a case he is styled Custos Rotulorum, besides. It is scarcely necessary to add that his functions are purely honorary. The High Sheriff is a personage whose duties, more numerous than those of the Lord Lieutenant, are also more important. He is obliged to preside over the elections 29"], [16, "THE PROVINCES. 4 of candidates for seats in Parliament, of Coroners and others, and to carry out the decisions and sentences of the civil courts and of criminal tribunals. As Queen's Bailiff he is also empowered to maintain the rights and prerogatives of the Crown throughout the extent of his bailiwick\u2014 that is, in tbe county. He is assisted by an Under-Sheriff, Bailiffs, and other functionaries. The Sheriff, who must be a man of landed property, is appointed by tbe Queen upon the nomination of the Lord Lieutenant, and he cannot refuse to\" exercise his functions for the term of office, which lasts one year. The Coroners (of whom there are four or five in each county) are elected for life by the landed proprietors, but the Crown has the right to nominate Coroners in certain places \u2014 at Windsor Castle for instance. The duties of a Coroner consist principally in holding inquests upon all people who have died by violence, or suddenly, and on those who die in prisons. So after an execution the Coroner proceeds to the prison, and opens an inquest upon the body of the deceased criminal. He is in every case assisted by a jury, who must view the dead body, otherwise no inquest can be held. In 1883, many individuals perished in a fire which consumed a lunatic asylum ; and although human beings had thus died, tbe Coroner was unable to hold an inquest at once, because no recognizable remains had been discovered, but some time afterwards one ofthe female servants ofthe establishment having died from the effects of her injuries, it was permissible for the inquest to be held; without such an incident as this, the Coroner would have had no official knowledge of the affair. Lastly, in the absence of the Sheriff, the Coroner is obliged to supervise the carrying out of the decisions and sentences of the various Courts and Tribunals. He is also charged with holding investigations in cases of shipwreck, or of treasure-trove. The administration of towns, parishes, and boroughs, which make up the county, is confided to the municipal authorities, and is known as \" Local Government.'' The disputes which often arose between the various local authorities, at length attracted the attention of the Government, and since 1871, these authorities have been placed under tke control of a committee called the Local Government Board, the Presi dent of which is nominated by the Queen, and of which the Lord President of the Council, the Lord Privy Seal, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the five principal Secretaries of State are ex officio members. The Board is a political body, and changes with the Ministry, of course. The duties of the Board consist, not in directing the municipal authorities, who are not dependent upon it, but in simply controlling their operations, and in taking care that they conform to the laws which govern the matter. For the purposes of Local Government, the country is divided into counties, parishes, and districts. The large counties are separated into divisions : some towns and cities are raised, with their surrounding territories, into distinct counties, which are called \" Counties Corporate.\" The duties of the local authorities are to maintain order, and to watch over the safety of the inhabitants, to provide primary education, to keep in order the public buildings, the streets, the roads and bridges which are within their jurisdiction, to pave and light the streets, to inspect the markets, public vehicles, &c. As will be perceived from the foregoing, the highways and roads are kept up at the expense of the parishes"], [17, "PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATION. 5 through which they run. Everyone in England is obliged to contribute to the mainten ance of the roads and bridges of which he makes use, but of them only. Englishmen will not admit that great public works undertaken for the benefit of a port on the south coast, for instance, should be executed at the expense of the inhabitants of the midland counties, and reciprocally it is the same. Dover wants a port of refuge ? Let Dover make it at her own expense. If Liverpool wishes to extend her dock accommodation, let Liverpool find the funds for the purpose. These matters have no concern for the Midlands \u2014 everyone for himself! Such is the principle which the English apply rigorously, and which they find works very well. If now we pass from theory to practice, the following is the organization of the parishes and municipal corporations. The parish is managed by the Vestry, a sort of Communal Council, elected by the ratepayers, which is charged with the administration of that district, with the nomination of all its functionaries and the distribution of its funds. The ecclesiastical business of a parish is confided to two churchwardens, one of whom is nominated by the Vicar, and the other is elected by the rate-payers, as they are called, the rates being the local imposts. Public relief, of which we have already spoken, is administered by a Council, elected by the rate-payers of each parish or union. The members of this body are known as Guardians of the Poor. The administration of the towns or boroughs is entrusted to Municipal Corporations, consisting of a Mayor, a certain number of Aldermen, and Common Councillors. Every tenant of a house, or shop, or office, or of any building whatever situated in the borough is a municipal elector; the right of voting extends even to women. The boroughs are divided into wards, and each ward elects a certain number of Coun cillors. These, a third of whom retire annually in rotation, elect the Aldermen, and the Town Council is thus constituted. It is presided over by a Mayor, elected for a year, from amongst the Aldermen. This, in a few words, is the municipal and parochial organization of England. We have now to show how the counties and boroughs are represented in Parliament, and what are the conditions necessary to be an elector. Universal suffrage does not exist in the United Kingdom. The male population of England and Wales which numbers 12,624,754 citizens, counted, until the new law of 1885 was passed, only 2,600,000 electors. The Act of 1885 added about 2,000,000 of new electors to those capable of voting for the counties and boroughs. An elector for the county must either be (1) a landed proprietor, whose revenues amount to at least forty shillings a year, after the deduction of all rates and taxes, or (2) a farmer paying contributions calculated upon a rateable annual value of at least \u00a312. In the towns and boroughs, to be an elector, one must be (1) a tenant of a house or lodging, or (2) a proved householder paying a \u00a310 rental. One may be at the same time an elector in many towns and counties, \" political domicile,\" as it is understood in France, not being recognized by English law. The New Act (1885) extended to the electors in the counties the arrangements applicable to those in the boroughs, and conferred the franchise upon the agricultural labourers and other wage-earning classes. Peers can neither vote in elections nor be elected. Judges, magistrates of police, or other tribunals, the clergy, Anglican, Scotch, or Boman Catholic, although permitted to"], [18, "6 THE PROVINCES. vote, are not eligible as Members of Parliament. Property is thus the base of the English electoral system, a statement which leads us to enter into some details of the large landed estates and their possessors. The superficial total of the United Kingdom is 77,635,300 acres, of which 45,575,747, including the parks and pasture land, are under cultivation. The remainder is occupied by the mountains\u2014 which are not numerous, England being comparatively flat \u2014 the lakes, rivers, and towns. The land is not divided as in France, where large estates are the exception : on the contrary, in England large properties are the rule. And there are only 320,000 landed proprietors in the whole of the United Kingdom ! According to the Parliamentary Blue Book, published in 1875, the land is divided as follows : \u2014 One quarter ofthe kingdom is in the hands of 1,200 persons, who possess on the average 16,000 acres each. Another quarter is held by 6,200 proprietors! each holding on an average 3,150 acres. A third quarter is divided amongst 50,770 owners of 380 acres each. And the last quarter belongs to 261,830 individuals, each of whom, on an average, owns 70 acres. Half the entire country belongs to 7,400 people, and the 600 peers who form the House of Lords hold amongst them a fifth part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ! On the other hand, amongst a hundred Englishmen, taken at random, you will scarcely find one who owns more than an acre of land. The yield of the land is estimated at \u00a3200,000,000 annually. Although, as we have seen, the peers possess one-fifth of the land, we must not conclude that, because a man is titled, he is therefore rich. This is a grave error, very commonly accepted in France, and even in England. More than one member of the Upper House has as much right as the brother of Bichard C\u0153ur de Lion to the title of Lackland, bestowed on the King who granted to the English Magna Charta \u2014 the groundwork of all their liberties. On the other hand, there are others whose domains are of almost fabulous extent. The Duke of Sutherland owns 1,358,545 acres, whose revenues are estimated at \u00a3140,000 a year. The Duke of Buccleugh possesses 460,000 acres of land, and draws from it \u00a3220,000 a year. The Earl of Breadalbane holds 438,000 acres; the Earl of Seafield, 305,000; the Duke of Richmond, 286,000; the Earl of Fife, 249,000; the Marquis of Athol, 200,000; the Duke of Devonshire as much: briefly, there are forty -four persons who possess more than 100,000 acres, and seventy-one who hold between 50,003 and 100,000. Nevertheless, all the large landed proprietors are not peers. To prove this, we may mention Lady Matheson, who owns 424,000 acres ; Sir Alexander Matheson, 220,000; Sir W. Williams Wynn (the \"King of Wales\") 145,000; The Macleod, 141,003; the Laird of Chisholm, 113,000; Mr. Berridge, the largest land owner in Ireland, 170,000. But there is a reverse to the medal : many of the estates yield nothing, or so little, that they become an expense to their owners, whose revenues are frequently out of all"], [19, "PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATION. 7 proportion to the extent of their domains. There are only fifteen persons whose land brings them in \u00a3100,000 a year; if we analyze the incomes ofthe other landed proprietors, we find fifty-one who enjoy revenues varying between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3100,000; two hundred and fifty-nine who have from \u00a320,000 to \u00a350,003 a year ; five hundred and forty-one from \u00a310,000 to \u00a320,000; and sixteen hundred with from \u00a33,000 to \u00a310,000. \u00a33,000 a year is a pretty fair income, it is true; but when the proprietor has paid all charges and taxes out of it, there seldom remains more than \u00a3600 a year to live on. Mr. Bateman, whose work is an authority on these matters, and whose figures we quote, very cleverly fixes the income of a Squire, the possessor of 3,500 acres, at \u00a35,000 ; and, after deducting bad debts, and charges imposed by the late parent's will, he comes to the conclusion that the net revenue of the fortunate owner does not exceed \u00a31,000 a year. The really rich man in England is he who possesses \u00a315,000 or \u00a320,000 in Consols, or in some industrial securities; but we shall make a great mistake if we base the fortune of one individual upon the number of acres he possesses. If we divide the amount ofthe revenues of the Duke of Sutherland into the aggregate number of the acres he owns, we find that he receives about two shillings and twopence an acre \u2014 which is ridiculous. It need scarcely be stated that large landed proprietors very often farm out their estates and do not cultivate them themselves ; although some may be at the same time proprietors and farmers: these are gentlemen-farmers.. The tenant-farmers number about 560,000 in England and Scotland, and 600,000 in Ireland. Much more extrava gant than the French farmers, they live more expensively, and are usually better instructed and more enlightened. \u2022 They bring a more extended knowledge to bear upon the cultivation of their land; they profit by all the discoveries of modern science; they renew and improve their plant continually, and obtain from tbe soil all that it is humanly possible to get out of it. They are, also, bound by their leases, whicli impose very heavy charges upon them, independently of the rent that they pay. So bad years are as disastrous for the farmers as for the landlords. Exhausted by many successive bad seasons, having no reserve fund (for the Englishman is not economical, and lives freely, spending all he makes), the farmers have found themselves for several years unable to meet the charges on their farms. The landlords have also suffered by this, and a number of them have, of their own accord, relinquished a considerable portion of their incomes, for they have remitted to the farmers 10, 15, 20, aud sometimes 50 per cent, of their rents. But it is not only to the insufficiency of the crops that we must attribute the depression under which English agriculture is suffering. The very rapid increase of the population has caused such a considerable importation of cereals, that the English farmer is crushed beneath the weight of supplies from Southern Russia, and, above all, from America, which alone furnishes England with nearly \u00a330,000,000 worth of grain and flour. The official statistics, admirably compiled, and very interesting, inform us that in 1882 such a quantity of these were imported that, divided by the amount of the population, the result was an average of more than 2411bs. per head. The quantity of cattle imported during the same year was enormous ; it had become necessary to demand from other countries 343,700 oxen, and 1,124,000 sheep, representing value to the"], [20, "THE PROVINCES. 8 amount of \u00a39,200,000. Tremendous competition this for the graziers, who are, however, happier than the farmers. Altogether, and what seems to bear out the statements of the economists of the Malthus School, who declare that the yield of the soil does not increase in the same proportion as the inhabitants, England, whicli, in 1862, with a population of twenty-nine millions, imported \u00a350,000,000 worth of food, or \u00a31 14*. Od. a head of the population, in 1882, imported food to the value of \u00a3110,000,000\u2014 a sum which, divided amongst the thirty-five millions of inhabitants of the United Kingdom, gives an average of \u00a33 3s. Od. per head. As a matter of fact the large estates in the Highlands of Scotland produce absolutely nothing; it is just the same in certain counties of Ireland in which the land lords have for years not received a red cent from their tenants, and may reckon themselves fortunate if they have not got a bullet in their heads instead of rent, or, at least, a threatening notice of assassination. However, if the land under cultivation does not pay more than two per cent., the colliery and mining districts, and town and city property, are sources of immense wealth. The influence of the landed proprietors is certainly much less than formerly, but it is still considerable. The time is passed when a lord could boast that he could send his steward or his footman to Parliament; nevertheless it would be an almost unheard-of thing that a candi date should come to oppose a son or a nominee of the Duke of Sutherland for the representation of that county in Parliament, or that some one, other than a Churchill, should solicit the suffrages of Woodstock. Lastly, have we not seen, quite lately, certain Scotch proprietors threatening the Crofters with eviction if they gave evidence before the Royal Commission appointed to enquire into their grievances against their landlords? These are exceptions, certainly, and rare exceptions, but is it not characteristic of the country, that in the year of grace, 1883, a Lord of the Manor has still so great power over the unfortunate people who have been born on his domain ? The time was so much the worse chosen, as the relations between the landlords and tenants are very strained in Ireland, and, as we all know, threaten to become so in England and Scotland ; and the complaints of the farmers have at length reached the ears of the Government, who appear to have made up their minds to do something for them. II. THE ARISTOCRACY : ELDER AND YOUNGER SONS. \u2014 TEN MINUTES TOO LATE ! THE COUNTRY GENTLEMAN. HOW LARGE FORTUNES ARE MANAGED. AGENTS AND SECRETARIES : A GILDED EXISTENCE. The British aristocracy is not solely composed of the Lords who sit in tbe Upper House. It includes, besides the Peerage\u2014 English, Scotch, and Irish\u2014 the baronets and those old families who trace their origin to the Norman Conquest, resting their"], [21, "THE ARISTOCRACY. 9 claims on parchments, the authenticity of which is doubted by some sceptics. But it is certain that the members of the aristocracy, which includes the nobility and gentry, form a class apart, and are designated the \" upper ten thousand,\" or, more often, the \" upper ten,\" with that love for abbreviation which distinguishes the Englishman, who is more economical of his syllables than of his guineas. In these great noble families of the landed gentry, the eldest son enjoys all the privileges and all the inheritance. This is invariably the case jn a titled family. No doubt the liberty of the testator is absolute, and no real law of primogeniture, properly so called, now exists; that is to say, there is no law which forces a father to leave his YACHTS AT COWES (ISLE OF WIGHT). fortune to the eldest of his children to the detriment of the others; but, as there is nothing which prevents him from doing so, it is seldom that matters are arranged differ ently. In all noble families the large domains must pass to him who inherits the title, and the eldest son, in his turn, cannot alienate them ; he is only a tenant for life, the true proprietor being the title; an imaginary entity, perhaps, but represented by trustees \u2014 very real personages indeed. Again, as a matter of fact, a father can entail his property. It is true that he cannot so bind it for more than two generations ; but there is nothing to prevent the last inheritor from renewing for two more generations the inalienability of the patrimonial estates, and so on. The right of primogeniture exists de facto ; and it is owing to the law of entail, now limited to two lives, but perpetual for the entails created before the new law, that the immense estates of the aristocracy are preserved intact. The results of this custom are sometimes very curious. There is at the present time in England, a younger son of a family, who, having been born ten minutes after his brother, is only allowed a modest income of a few hundreds a year, while his twin brother enjoys a large revenue. It was an unlucky stroke of fortune, and few people have"], [22, "1 THE PROVINCES. 10 so nearly won a stake. Nevertheless, the moral effect is the same, no matter what the difference between the ages of the children of the same father. From a feeling of pride by no means uncommon, even people who have no titles nor estates\u2014 great merchants, rich financiers\u2014 give tbe preference to their eldest sous. Thus the fortunes they have acquired go on increasing from generation to generation, and the names of these Cr\u0153suses become a synonym for wealth, which flatters their self love until the day comes when they exchange it for a peerage and a seat in the Upper House. The head of a noble family only considers it his duty to give his younger sons the education of gentlemen, and to provide them with an income which will keep them from want, without, however, permitting them to live in the same style as they did in their youth. Some, the minority, of these are content with their modest pittance ; they live in London, where their names are pass-words to every house, and they frequent those hospitable mansions where they are well entertained. When London is empty at the end of the \" Season \" they take refuge in their clubs, or go on the Continent to water ing-places where roulette, trente et quarante, or baccarat are still played. The rest who constitute the large majority embrace one of the three avocations which a gentleman can enter without derogating from his dignity \u2014 the Army, the Church, or business. Very few choose the Bar, and none medicine, by which it must not be understood that the profession of medicine is not an honoured one in England ; on the contrary, doctors are much appreciated and sought after in society, and the most celebrated are invariably created Baronets. Many younger sons thus gain very good positions, and some of them, by their intelligence and capacity, have been known to equal, and, at times, surpass the incomes of their eldest brothers. The latter, after quitting the University, seek nominations as Members of Parliament. They prepare themselves for political life by visiting the Colonies and foreign countries, by the study of economical and social questions, which are debated unceasingly, and of which the English are passionately fond. One of their first acts is to put their names down as candidates for membership at the particular clubs which reflect their views; and candidates are so numerous in certain well known clubs that one may have to wait for five or six years or more before being elected. There are few members of the House of Lords who have not passed the Commons, wherein they made their political debut, and it is a well-known fact that the most clever of the Peers, and those whose opinions have most weight, are those who have served their apprenticeship in the Lower House. There are exceptions, but they are so much the more remarkable because rare. The English Peerage is thus composed of men, who, for the most part, are accustomed to the contests of parliamentary life, and acquainted with the wants and aspirations of the residents of their respective counties which they have represented in the House of Commons ; some of them, accustomed to business, distinguished orators, skilful politicians, turn out statesmen of the highest rank. Others again embrace a military career, and pass some years in one of the regiments of the Guards, while they are awaiting the time when they will come into their property, and sit in the House of Lords, where they are content to vote with their party, without taking any active part in the debates."], [23, "THE COUNTRY GENTLEMAN. 11 The Country Gentleman, who lives exclusively on his estates, is becoming more and more a rara avis. Here and there may be found some who only quit their estates to come to London for the season, but they may be counted on the fingers. Some years hence they will all have disappeared to make room for the gentlemen of the new school, who scarcely pass any time on their estates, except in the shooting season, from the middle of August to the end of November, and go to sun themselves at Nice, in Egypt, or Madeira, during the winter, and return to London for the opening of Parliament, if they are members of either House, or for the Season, if they have no other guide than DEER-STALKING IN SCOTLAND. SETTING OUT. caprice, or no other pursuit besides pleasure. This cosmopolitan existence has for the modern Englishman a particular charm which his ancestors would not have understood. Although the English have always been the greatest travellers on earth, they have never lived so much abroad as they do at present. There is not, so to speak, an English family with any pretensions to belong to Society which has not lived this double existence, and spent a part of the year either in France, Italy, or Germany. Very much in sheep-fashion, those in \" Society \" follow blindly the example set them by their leaders,\u2014 that is to say, by certain well-known personages, whom it is good form to imitate\u2014 while denying that they do so. This is, however, a trait common to the aristocracies of all countries. The manner of living, of dressing, of speaking, practised by these leaders of society, is scrupulously imitated by those who are, as they say, in the world! In consequence of this habit the word \"Revenue\" has been altered in pronunciation since, in a speech from the Throne, a particular emphasis was laid on it, 30"], [24, "THE PROVINCES. 12 which is now specially affected by fashionable people. The mania for being distinguished from the common herd is so great that some people, whose unlucky stars have bestowed on them a vulgar name, attempt to hide it orthographically in the most fantastic way. Thus Erown becomes Browne, and Smith, Smythe, or Smyth; \"double your name and add an e,\" said Thackeray, \"nothing gives you such a fashionable air as that.\" When orthography fails and the name cannot be altered in writing, they have recourse to a special pronunciation, almost always whimsical, and which common people do not possess. Beauchamp, for instance, is pronounced Bitchamm; Cholmondeley, Chumley. All this is very harmless, but at the same time, it proves that the English are addicted to puerilities which one would not expect to meet with amongst so positive and practical a people. It is in its lordly dwellings, in its princely domains, surrounded by the greatest luxury, in the midst of artistic gems of immense value \u2014 in a word, in all its splendour \u2014 that one must see the upper class of English society to understand its influence and the respect with which it is surrounded. In a country where money is all powerful, where property carries with it so many advantages and privileges, it is not surprising that those who possess all the semblances of wealth \u2014 imaginary in some cases, real in others \u2014 it is not surprising, we say, that the aristocracy, the nobility and gentry, should be regarded with a respectful admiration, mingled, if the truth be told, with envy, and sometimes with sullen spitefulness ; but the first-mentioned sentiment predominates. How calculated to excite covetousness is this gilded existence of the English aristo cracy \u2014 the only one in Europe which has preserved almost all its prerogatives intact, in spite of the levelling tendencies of the age and the progress of new ideas. And how well these grandees know how to arrange their lives ! How everything is regulated to render their existence easy and pleasant ! The large estates are administered by an agent, himself a landed proprietor, and often a solicitor, who resides upon the property confided to his supervision. 'Tis he who makes terms with the farmers, and has under his orders the managers of the mines, blast-furnaces, or other industrial enterprises which are carried on by the landlord, who on his part has no trouble at all. When he wants to buy or sell, or to borrow money, the trustees intervene, and through their instrumentality the business is concluded. The proprietor is in leading strings. The agents of certain noblemen are veritable ministers, and have under their orders a staff of engineers, architects, and various clerks. The urban proprietors are represented by an agent placed at the head of a special administra tion. In London, the Dukes of Westminster, Portland, Bedford, the Marquis of Salisbury, Lord Portman, and one or two other noblemen, have been obliged to devote a whole house to the accommodation of their working staff. Five or six of these peers own nine-tenths of the metropolis amongst them, and their revenues amount to hundreds of pounds sterling per day. The castle, or the lordly mansion, is administered by a private secretary, who has under his orders all the domestics in livery, or not in livery \u2014 upper and lower servants. This post is no sinecure. The moves, the dinner-parties, balls, fetes, receptions, hunting, shooting or fishing parties, impose continuous work upon him. The guests arrive at the castle attended by their valets or ladies'-maids : there are"], [25, "THE COUNTRY HOUSE. 13 fifty, sixty, or a hundred persons to lodge and provide for. There must be carriages and vans to carry guests and their luggage. To the grand balls guests are invited from many miles round, and a special train is kept waiting in the station to carry them home again. During the autumn there are continual amusements ; the relays of guests succeed each other almost incessantly. Hunting, shooting, and fishing parties are followed by DEER-STALKING IN SCOTLAND. LUNCH-TIME. dinners, balls, and concerts ; private theatricals are got up ; all enjoy themselves in a princely manner \u2014 royally. When a Prince of the blood, or a Highness on his travels, deigns to honour with his presence one of these gatherings, tbe magnificence which is displayed eclipses that of many foreign Courts, and astonishes even Orientals. Did not one of these potentates say, on one occasion, after being present at a fete given by the Duke of S , that if he had in his dominions a man so rich, he would have his head cut off? Certainly, these entertainments are of unequalled magnificence and splendour.

It is a gratification of all the senses, of all the faculties \u2014 an intoxication of wealth \u2014 the apotheosis of fortune ! It is considered bon ton for grandees to have, besides their mansions on their ancestral estates, shooting boxes in Scotland or in Norfolk ; a marine residence at Cowes, in the Isle of Wight, where assembles the Royal Yacht Squadron, of which the Prince of Wales is Commodore. One more opportunity for lavish expenditure occurs in these sailing, or"], [27, "A GILDED EXISTENCE. 15 steam, yachts, which year by year are becoming more numerous, larger, and better found. Thousands are expended in their construction, furnishing, and equipment. Some are as large as a small ship of war, and to go round the world in one of these yachts is the acme of enjoyment and happiness for those who are not afraid of sea-sickness. Others less ambitious, content themselves with a cruise to Norway in summer, or to the Mediter ranean in winter. When \" My Lord\" has shot his stags or grouse in Scotland, he crosses the Atlantic and hunts the grizzly bear in the Rocky Mountains, or buffalo in the plains of America. An English sportsman accomplishes this trip with as much ease as a Frenchman would proceed to Chantilly to shoot. \" My Lady \" herself accompanies the expedition, sleeps under canvas, and accomplishes immense distances on horseback. During the absence of their parents, the children remain in the family mansion ; tbe boys are confided to the care of a tutor, and the girls to their governess. If the boys are grown up, they go to a public school, or to a University ; but the daughters never go to a boarding school. As will be understood, to carry out all these objects one must enjoy an immense revenue, of which only a certain number are possessed ; but these privileged ones are not so few as might be supposed. Besides the titled personages whose names are well known, and whose acts and proceedings are carefully chronicled in the \" Society Journals,\" there are a certain number of the members of the aristocracy who, although little known to the general public, possess fabulous wealth. In 1883 died two men belonging to the nobility, one of whom left \u00a35,000,000, and the other \u00a312,000,000: between them totalling 425,000,000 of francs. On the other hand there are inheritors of great names, attached \u2014 that is the word \u2014 to luxurious mansions who have not had the good fortune to find coal or iron on their estates, spending all their incomes in keeping up their ancestral homes, which they cannot dispose of, and which are positively ruining them."], [28, "THE PROVINCES. 16 III. DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE AND THE CELEBRATED COUNTRY SEATS. ALNWICK CASTLE, HATFIELD HOUSE, CHATSWORTH, BLENHEIM, WOBURN ABBEY. The ancient Britons were instructed by the Romans in the art of building durable residences, and in embellishing them. The oldest monuments in England, those which have survived the struggles of the Saxons with the Danes, date from the Roman occupation. If the Saxons did nothing for the civilization of Great Britain, the Normans, on \u25a0 OCTAGON TOWER AND BARBICAN, ALNWICK CASTLE. the contrary, had an influence in the highest degree beneficial. Delighting in the pomp of warlike display, in the expense and luxury of the feudal system which they inaugurated in the country, the Norman chiefs, amongst whom William divided the country, built on their extensive estates castles \u2014 or, rather, fortresses \u2014 whence they made forays upon their neighbours' territories, and in which they shut themselves up to resist assault when they were in their turn attacked. Such is the origin of these feudal structures, some of which still stand. For five hundred years they have preserved their warlike appearance. They were surrounded by moats, flanked with towers, and defended by a swarm of servants, more soldiers than domestics. One of the most remarkable of these is the celebrated castle of Alnwick, which belongs to the Duke of Northumberland ; it is situated in that county, between New castle and Berwick."], [29, "COUNTRY SEATS. 17 Built on the right bank of the Alne to the north of the town of Alnwick, we perceive from a distance its imposing mass, bristling with turrets, embattled and machicolated, protected by thick walls, which support sixteen massive towers. In the Middle Ages Alnwick defended the English frontier against the Scots, who three times besieged it, but unsuccessfully. In 1093 Malcolm III., King of Scotland, met his death before the castle, which he was besieging ; and later, in 1174, another Scottish sovereign was made prisoner by tbe defenders of Alnwick. A monument on which is inscribed : \u2014 \" William the Lion, King of Scotland, besieging Alnwick Castle, was here ALNWICK CASTLE (FROM THE RIVER). taken prisoner, 1174,\" is still to be seen in the park on the very spot where William was captured by his enemies. Of very ancient origin, Alnwick Castle, much affected by time and the assaults it has withstood, was in the last century in a deplorably ruinous condition when it passed into the possession of Hugh, Duke of Northumberland, who hastened to restore it and to bestow upon it its ancient character. He caused new buildings to be erected in perfect harmony with the ancient portions, whicli were carefully repaired, and re bestowed upon this noble pile the characteristic grandeur which the neglect of his predecessors had permitted it to lose. The entrance to the castle, dating from the 14th century, is protected by a barbican of the same period, picturesquely surmounted by stone effigies, representing men-at-arms in various attitudes, which from a distance have the appearance of living sentinels. Between the battlements of some towers, and upon the parapets, we find these strange stone defenders. In one of the interior courts the Norman archway and the well particularly"], [30, "THE PROVINCES. 18 demand our attention. The arch dates from the 12th century; it is one of the most beautiful and the best preserved specimens of the period which it is possible to find. The mouth of the well, which is at the side, is formed by a large ogival bay let into the wall, and inclosing three other and smaller bays, in which works the wheel that draws the water. Above is a statue of a saint supported by a curious human face. By a curious anomaly, the apartments which are situated in the Prudhoe Tower, erected in 1854, are decorated in the Italian style \u2014 a circumstance which has met with much criticism. However, as nothing of tbe old ornamentation was left \u2014 neither ALNWICK CASTLE (FROM THE PLAIN). furniture, tapestry, nor woodwork \u2014 it was only natural that a modern building should have been furnished in modern style. In this we recognize a courage which is not possessed by every one ; for is it not better to make the new new, than the old new ? A magnificent marble staircase, the steps of which are four yards wide, leads to the upper floors, decorated and furnished with great taste and richness, and containing a fine collection of pictures. The works of the Italian school have come from the Camuccini gallery. Giulio Romano, Guercino, Sebastian del Piombo, Carracci, Giorgione, Perugino, Guido Reni, Titian, Claude Lorrain, Nicholas Poussin, and Van Dyck, are represented by pictures of great value. Alnwick Castle also possesses a fine library, a collection of ancient and modern arms, a museum of British and Roman antiquities, and, above all, an Egyptian museum, containing very rare and curious objects collected by one of the Dukes of Northumber land while travelling in the country of the Pharaohs. The gardens are of great"], [31, "COUNTRY SEATS. 19 beauty ; the park, which is of considerable extent, is open to the public on Thursdays and Sundays. The curiosities of Alnwick Park, besides the monument to William, are a Celtic tomb and the two ancient abbeys of Alnwick and Hulne. In the latter we mav admire the old tapestry worked after cartoons by Rubens ; and we will remark amongst other interesting objects a stone statue representing a monk at prayers. Placed on the SOUTHERN FACADE, HATFIELD HOUSE. grass in the midst of the ruins this figure has a startling effect. The abbey of Alnwick is about a mile from the castle, near the Lion Bridge. Another castle dating from tbe same period is that of Warwick, which for the tourist possesses the inestimable advantage of being much nearer London, and con sequently more easy of access; but from the picturesque point of view, Alnwick Castle is probably the more characteristic of the two. When at the close ofthe reign of Henry VIII. the more tranquil condition of the kingdom permitted the nobles to occupy themselves with the embellishment of their mansions, and to give them a less stern appearance, they budt these castles, of which the great hall of the palace of Hampton Court is one of the few examples which remain. The majority of the edifices of that epoch have been swept away, and there remain but the ruins, or the portions of them, incorporated into modern constructions. During the reigns of Elizabeth and James I., Italian, French, and Flemish artists, 31"], [32, "20 THE PROVINCES. attracted to England by the nobles, revolutionised public taste. To the sober and severe style of decoration succeeded elegant facades, profusely embellished by columns, caryatids, medallions, escutcheons, aud devices. Holland House, in London, and Hatfield House, in Hertfordshire, belonging to the Marquis of Salisbury, are fine specimens of this style of architecture. Hatfield House was built in 1611, by James I., who bestowed it upon Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, in exchange for another domain, which he possessed in another county, which was more to the monarch's taste. It is a brick edifice, with stone dressings, consisting of a central building with two wings, forming three sides of a quadrangle with the southern facade. The whole building presents the appearance of an E lying down. The extremities of the long arms are terminated by two square turrets, surmounted by cupolas. The principal entrance, which is situated on the north side, is topped with a piriform cupola. This front, almost unbroken, is, nevertheless, cut by the wings of the entrance porch, and by two towers higher than the rest of the building, and surmounted by a balustrade. The white stone settings of the windows, which are wider than they are high, relieve the sombre colouring of the bricks, and accentuate with the stone dressings the grand lines of the building. The southern facade is much more richly embellished. The central portion, in the Italian style, -with its columns, its arcade, and its stone-faced gables, is ornamented with some very finely-executed sculpture. Above the entrance we remark a gigantic escutcheon ofthe Cecils. The two wings, with projecting windows and double flights of steps over looking the interior court, complete, in a most tasteful manner, an architectural ensemble of rare elegance. A pretty balustrade separates the garden from the park, which extends as far as the eye can reach, and is celebrated as being the most beautiful in the county. The visitor will admire the long avenues of venerable trees and enormous oaks, two of which are celebrated \u2014 one, the \" Lion Oak,\" because it is more than thirty feet in circumference, and is considered to be a thousand years old ; the other, because Queen Elizabeth used to repose beneath its spreading branches. The interior of Hatfield House is magnificent, The hall, panelled with carved wood and hung with old tapestry ; the staircase, with its delicately-worked bannisters ; the galleries, which extend the whole length of the central pavilion \u2014 are models of taste, and perhaps the only specimens of the style of the period which have been so well preserved. The gallery on the first floor, 150 feet long, 18 feet wide, and 15 feet high, is hung with pictures, amongst which we remark the portraits, attributed to Holbein, of Henry VIII. and his six wives. Hatfield House is rich in portraits, but contains comparatively , few other pictures. On the other hand, the library contains books, manuscripts, and autographs, both rare and valuable. In the room known as the great chamber, various articles at one time belonging to divers English Sovereigns are kept. The most remarkable are the watch of James I., the chaplet of Mary Stuart (in diamonds, they say) , a pair of yellow silk stockings worn by Queen Elizabeth, and the chalice and patten which were used at the coronation of Philip and Mary. This room also contains a fine portrait of a Marchioness of Salisbury, by Sir Joshua Reynolds. The dining-room, which is very beautiful, is embellished with portraits of Elizabeth and Mary Stuart, and with magnificent Spanish tapestry. At one end is the musicians'"], [33, "COUNTRY SEATS. 21 gallery, richly carved and decorated with escutcheons, and there are also sus pended some French stan dards, kept in countenance by an immense British flag at the other extremity. As a specimen of domestic architecture of the time of James I., Hatfield House is the most perfect, and by far the most interest ing, monument in England. It is only twenty miles \u25a0 from London, on the Great Northern Railway, and the Hatfield station is not far from the House. The Italian Renaissance, the influence of which was soon felt in England, where people were quickly smitten by the models left \u25a0 by Palladio, the architect of the Palace of the Doges of Venice, superseded in a short time the style of James I.'s period. It was Inigo Jones _\u00a3&__-. - who first began to build those edifices imitated from the monuments of Greece and Italy, which people have HATFIELD PARK AND ELIZABETH'S OAK."], [34, "THE PROVINCES. 22 used and abused ever since. The architects of that period had the assistance of Rubens, Verrio, and Laguerre, who ornamented with frescoes the walls of the palaces their colla borateurs constructed. Under Charles I. and Charles II. they imitated the splendours of Versailles ; the gardens were designed and planted in French style. Le Notre planned St. James's Park; symmetry replaced the picturesque; it was the triumph of the straight line. Christopher Wren brought back from France the ornamentation and sculptures with which he overlaid his buildings ; and, later, Vanburgh and Gibbs exaggerated this tendency, and burthened their edifices with a too great profusion of ornament. This style of architecture, which is always held in great estimation in England, as the clubs in Pall Mall and other modern buildings attest, is known as the Palladian style. The master-piece of this genre, as well as the richest mansion in England, is Chatsworth, in Derbyshire, the palatial residence of the Dukes of Devonshire, which was built, on the plans of Sir C. Wren, about the end of the 17th century. Chatsworth House is situated in a wide and deep valley, at the foot of a hil! clothed with luxuriant trees. The Derwent's limpid waters meander through the park, which is about ten miles in circumference. The house is reached by a bridge spanning the river. The plan of Chatsworth is a rectangle, the sides of which are 90 feet in length. In the centre is a court. The four faces of this building, of the Ionic order, are pierced by numerous windows, with gilded frames, and surmounted by marble balustrades. Marble predominates at Chatsworth. The principal facade is ornamented with a frieze, upon which we read the motto of the Cavendishes, Cavendo tutus, and a triangular pediment. A terrace, which extends the whole length of the mansion, communicates by a wide flight of steps with the park. The princely luxury which is evident in the interior of this palace, and the art-treasures which it shelters, necessitate a somewhat detailed description of some of the principal apartments. First, the great hall, which is 60 feet long, is embellished with pictures by Verrio and Laguerre, representing various incidents in the life of Julius C\u00e6sar. The ceiling represents the apotheosis of the great Roman warrior. A staircase with double curves leads us to the chapel, where Verrio has painted, above the altar, the \" Incredulity of Thomas,\" which is regarded as his best work. The three remarkable wood-carvings are by Grinling Gibbons, who surpassed himself in the decoration of Chatsworth. The sketch gallery includes a priceless collection of drawings by the old Masters, amongst which are four sketches by Michael Angelo, a fine portrait of Titian by himself, portraits of Henry VII. and Henry VIII., by Holbein, and other masterly works, signed by Salvator Rosa, Giulio Romano, Andrea del Sarto, Van Dyck, and Albert Diirer. In the south picture gallery, some paintings of the greatest value meet our eyes ; amongst others a \"Holy Family,\" by Murillo; \"The Woman taken in Adultery,\" by Paul Veronese; \"St. John in the Desert,\" by Titian; \"The Consecration of Thomas a Beckett,\" by Van Eyck ; a Sea-piece, by Van der Velde ; and the celebrated \"Convent Chapel,\" by Granet. The ball-room is 90 feet in length and 21 in width. The ceiling and walls are covered with gilding and pictures, with excellent effect ; while the wood-carvings, by Grinling Gibbons, possess a delicacy unparalleled. One of these carvings represents a"], [35, "GRAND HALL (HATFIELD HOUSE)."], [36, "THE PROVINCES. 24 lace cravat, and is a master-piece of skill. The private saloon, which is not usually shewn to the public, contains a beautiful copy of the Venus de Medici, by Bartolini, and many pictures by Jansen, Lely, Zucchero, Holbein, and Titian. We also remark a portrait of the famous Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. The billiard-room, or the red-velvet room, the ceiling of which is painted by Thornhill, contains modern pictures, of which the most interesting is \" Bolton Abbey,\" by Landseer. The library, to which visitors are not admitted, is ornamented with marble columns of different colours, and boasts a priceless collection of specimens of early printing, rare editions, and manuscripts of great value. The new dining-room with a vaulted ceiling is particularly remarkable for the portraits, painted by Van Dyck, which cover the walls, and for the two vast chimney pieces of Carrara marble, sculptured by Westmacott and Sevier, each of which cost \u00a31,000 sterling. The sculpture is collected in a special gallery, lighted from above, and is almost all modern. The most important piece is the statue of \" Madame Letitia Bonaparte,\" by Canova ; there is also an \" Endymion Asleep \" by the same artist, which is a master piece of graceful execution. The \"Venus with the Apple,\" by Thorwaldsen; the \" Spinning Girl,\" by Schadow : the \" Discobolus,\" by Kessels ; the \" Bacchante,\" by Bartolini; and \"Mars and Cupid,\" by Westmacott, the younger, are amongst the number of remarkable works in the collection. The gardens, the park, and the water-works of Chatsworth, are deservedly celebrated. On the side of the hill behind the mansion is a temple, from which, at will, can be turned on torrents of water, which fall down in cascades upon the wide steps made to receive them, and thence into the canals cut specially for them. This temple, and the jet of water which issues from the great basin to a height of 240 feet, have been compared to the water- works of Versailles, of which they are reduced copies. But what Versailles has not is a weeping willow in zinc, whose leaves and branches are pierced with innumerable holes, from which falls on those who take refuge beneath it, an abundant and refreshing shower, as soon as a spring in the trunk is pressed. As a piece of mechanism it is ingenious ; as a joke it seems in questionable taste. But the most remarkable object that Chatsworth Park contains is its conserva tory ; such as one has never seen \u2014 a conservatory, unique, monumental, in which one can drive in a carriage, so vast are its dimensions and so wide its alleys. This marvel was. constructed by Sir Joseph Paxton, and served as a model for the Exhibition Building of 1851, now the Crystal Palace. Composed entirely of iron and glass, the Chatsworth conservatory consists of an immense central nave and two parallel aisles. Its dimensions are as follows: length 276 feet; width 126 feet; height 65 feet, and it covers about an acre of ground. It is reached by a narrow road, in which enormous blocks of stone are disposed, so as to imitate a mountain pass. The aspect of the rare plants, the brilliant colours of the flowers, and their captivating perfumes are fairy-like. The English are the best gardeners in the world, which is a truth easy to be understood, after one has seen the gardens of rich private owners, and those at Kew, which belong to the State. In an angle of this palace of glass, behind an artificial"], [37, "COUNTRY SEATS. 25 rock, where ferns and orchids of great beauty flourish, a staircase leads to the gallery which runs all round the conservatory, and from which the visitor may admire at leisure the superb vegetation which is presented to his gaze. The temperature is maintained at a proper degree by a system of pipes of more than seven miles in length, in which the hot air circulates from four gigantic furnaces. In order to keep these supplied CONSERVATORY (CHATSWORTH HOUSE). with fuel, a tunnel, about a third of a mile loug, with tramway and waggons, has been constructed for the conveyance of the coal."], [38, "THE PROVINCES. 26 The kitchen garden, the garden devoted to Australian plants, the cyclopean aqueduct which supplies water to a cascade 150 feet high, are equally objects of astonish ment and admiration for the visitor astounded by such opulence. If Chatsworth, in its magnificent richness, is the most beautiful mansion in England, Blenheim, the masterwork of Vanburgh, is the most imposing, the largest, and the most astonishing \u2014 for it is a monument raised to the glories of the British arms; as a memento of the battle of Blenheim, as the English call it\u2014 Hochst\u00e6dt, as the French designate it. Queen Anne, in order to reward the husband of the celebrated Sarah Jennings, made him a present of the manor of Woodstock, in Oxfordshire, and the domains thereto appertaining. Parliament, when ratifying the gift, voted a sum of \u00a3480,000 for the erection of the palace, which was finished in 1715, one year after the death of the Queen. Blenheim Palace is about eight miles from Oxford, and it is usually by the triumphal arch of Woodstock that the visitor enters the park. He then sees the palace which rises on the left, on the further side of the lake, and opposite is visible the column 120 feet high, which is surmounted by a colossal statue of the Duke of Marlborough iu Boman costume. The pedestal, decorated with bas-reliefs, bears an inscription recalling his victories. After crossing the bridge, which spans the lake at its narrowest part, we come upon the principal facade of the mansion, the length of whicli, from one extremity to the other, is 850 feet. The centre is occupied by a majestic portico, supported by six columns of the Corinthian order. A triangular pediment, the tympanum of which is embellished with sculptures displaying, amidst military trophies, the arms of the Churchill family, with their motto, Fiel Pero Dediachado is surmounted by a statue of Minerva. At the angles of the steps are pedestals bearing trophies guarded by Sphinxes. The portico, which projects, forms, with the central building, re-entering angles hidden by two rows of pilasters of the Doric order, which unite with the two square buildings, and complete the principal block of the palace. Two arcades, supported by massive columns, connect each of these two buildings to a side wing in harmony with the rest of the edifice, which thus encloses three sides of a square court. One of these wings contains the kitchens and offices ; the other, the stables and coachhouses. The opposite facade, which looks upon the garden, presents almost the same appear ance, with the exception of the pediment, which is replaced by an acrotera sustaining a colossal bust of Louis XIV. taken at Tournay. Below we find the inscription : \u2014 \"EUROP\u00c6 H\u00c6C VINDEX GENIO DECORA ALTA BR1TANNO.\" \u2022 The great hall, to which entry is gained beneath the portico of the park facade, is a magnificent apartment 60 feet in height. A door of communication opens into the great drawing-room, which also rises the whole height of the edifice. It is in the form of a long square, and is lighted at the side by a double row of windows. The plinths and frames of the four doors, as well as the two vast chimney-pieces, are of marble. The other three sides of the drawing-room are decorated with paintings by Laguerre, in which are represented, in six panels, separated by double columns, the various nations"], [39, "CHATSWORTH HOUSE."], [40, "THE PROVINCES. 28 of Europe. The tops of the doors are ornamented with bas-reliefs, and thc ceiling, supported by caryatids, is occupied by a grand allegorical composition of a group in which the principal figure is Marlborough, still in Roman costume, arrested in the midst of his victorious career by Time and Peace. A frame of foliage encloses this remarkable painting. The collection of pictures at Blenheim, now dispersed, was one of the richest in Great Britain, and without furnishing a catalogue of them, it is impossible to give, even approximately, an idea of the remarkable works which it included. Of Rubens' pictures FACADE OF CHATSWORTH HOUSE. alone there were about twenty of unquestioned authenticity, and entirely from the master's own hand. Their origin was, besides, undoubted, for all of them were presented to the Duke by the important towns of the Netherlands \u2014 Brussels, Antwerp, and Ghent. The pearl of the collection, the celebrated \" Madonna dei Ansidei,\" was purchased by Government at the price of \u00a370,000, and placed in the National Gallery. The Library at Blenheim is but a memory. The rich collection of rare and valuable books of unique manuscripts was sold by auction by the late Duke, who died at the end of 1883. Every one knows what fabulous prices were paid for the beautiful editions which formed the Sunderland Library. The visitor will not quit the palace without visiting the chapel, in which a colossal monument marks the tomb of the Duke of Marlborough : the statuary with which it is embellished is by Rysbrach. The park is thirteen miles in circumference. The private gardens, situated behind the palace, contain a temple built in commemoration of the restoration to health of"], [41, "COUNTRY SEATS. 29 George III., a fine cascade and a fountain, copied from that of the Piazza Navona, at Rome, decorated with statues by Bernini. It is scarcely necessary to add that the expenditure in keeping up such a palace and park as Blenheim amounts annually to fabulous sums\u2014 so fabulous, that the fortunate proprietor sees the greater portion of his revenue eaten up by this monster. Blenheim is in some ways the last specimen of that English architecture of the 17th and 18th centuries, of which Versailles was the model. At the end of the last BLENHEIM PALACE. B century Wyatt revived the Norman-Gothic style, which B became the fashion. The mansions he erected for noble- Bmen are in the style of the Baronial Halls. At the same period people got tired of parks and gardens, with trees cut into pyramids and balloons, and of straight walks. They banished the Tritons from the ornamental water; the Floras, Pomonas, the nymphs, fauns, and satyrs no longer exhibited in the shrubberies their graceful forms or grimacing faces; the parks were permitted to assume their natural aspect, and, so far from detracting from the Halls they surrounded, they enhanced the picturesque or the architectural effect. After that time we no longer find any characteristic architecture in England. They imitate ; copy. Some architects hold to the Gothic, others to the Grecian ; these adhere to the Elizabethan ; those to the style of James I. From this period dates Woburn Abbey, the residence of the Duke of Bedford, erected on the site of the ancient Benedictine Abbey, whence its name. This immense building, of the Doric order, the plan of which is a vast parallelogram,"], [42, "THE PROVINCES. 30 is situated in the midst of one of the most beautiful parks in England. The principal or western facade presents a central pediment, supported by columns and pilasters, and two angular buildings. It is all very simple, and very far removed from the splendours of Chatsworth and Blenheim. But Wobnrn will not yield to the others in artistic treasures. The collection of pictures of all schools belonging to the Duke of Bedford is one of the most beautiful that can possibly be seen. The Flemish, Italian, Spanish, French, and English masters are there represented by their most celebrated masterpieces. An enumeration of them would fill a volume, but we may mention the historical portraits of all the members NORMAN WELLS (ALNWICK CASTLE). of the Russell family, from the first Duke of Bedford to the present ; and the portraits of celebrated artists which cover the walls of the library. A covered way leads from the mansion to the sculpture gallery, which contains remarkably fine works by Canova, Thorwaldsen, and Chantrey, with antique marbles from Italy and Greece. In the park, which is enclosed by a wall eight feet high and twelve miles in cir cumference (a miniature wall of China), and intersected by magnificent avenues planted with trees, is a beautiful lake, a wood of 120 acres in extent, and several farms. This splendid domain is stocked with deer, and with game of all descriptions. The Duke of Bedford is one of the richest proprietors in England, and possesses something like 86,000 acres, scattered in a dozen different counties, the annual income from which is more than \u00a3160,000 a year. But the bulk of his fortune consists in the innumerable houses he owns in London, and which, year in, year out, bring his Grace, at a low estimate, \u00a3400,000 annually."], [43, "COUNTRY SEATS. 31 The few mansions of which we have spoken can give a vague idea of the palaces of the English nobility, and a vague idea only. There is but one Blenheim and one Chatsworth ; but, with these two exceptions, there are in Great Britain more than 500 mansions, remarkable in many ways, and all containing pictures, sculpture, and objects of art, or valuable libraries. One cannot conceive the amount of artistic treasures which England contains, and, contrary to the practice of other nations, these riches are not possessed by the State, but by private individuals. Again, those who have only examined the national museums of London carry away a relatively false impression, and return home with the idea that the English do not appreciate, and do not seek for, art treasures. It is the contrary which is the truth, and it is desirable to give of our neighbours a correct and more true impression. Take works of art. In what country are there more of them \u2014 so many of them ? Where are the splendid old paintings, the beautiful canvases of Rubens, Murillo, Van Dyck, Velasquez? Where are the exquisite collections of Sevres and of Dresden china? Where are the beautiful pieces of furniture of Biihl and Biesener, the bronzes of Gouthiere ? Where are the tapestries of the Gobelins ? In all the mansions of the English aristocracy. If one can reproach the owners, it is because they perhaps delight too exclusively in ancient art productions, and somewhat neglect modern artists."], [44, "DURHAM CASTLE.

The geological constitution of England, whicli is most interesting from a purely scientific point of view, since it discloses rocks of all periods, offers, from the industrial aspect, resources, so to speak, inexhaustible. The most important productions of the kingdom are coal and iron ; then lead, tin, and copper. The coal-measures, of exceptional abundance, are scattered beneath nearly the whole surface of England \u2014 from Northumberland in the North, to Devonshire in tbe South. There is scarcely one county, except in the south-east, in which we do not find"], [45, "THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICTS. 33 coal mines. It is calculated that one-tenth part of the superficial total of the country is occupied by the coal-measures, which extend about 12,000 square miles, of whicli more than two-thirds furnish the bituminous and the remainder the anthracite coal. The former kind is almost exclusively used for domestic purposes \u2014 its sticky appearance while burning is well known, and its greasy aspect is characteristic. The anthracite, or stone-coal, only burns at a very high temperature. The chemical difference between DURHAM CATHEDRAL. the two species of coal consists chiefly in the quantity of carbon which they relatively contain. Thus the bituminous coal of Ebbw Vale, in Wales, contains 85 in 100 of carbon; while the anthracite of Swansea contains 93 in 100 parts. Although Scotland possesses coal-mines of considerable importance, they are far from being so rich as those of England, which, including Wales, furnishes five-sixths of the total production of the United Kingdom, which was, in 1882, 156,499,977 tons, the value of which was estimated at about \u00a367,000,000 sterling. In 1855 it was 61 millions of tons; in 1860, 83 millions; in 1870, 110 millions. The increase"], [46, "THE PROVINCES. 34 is considerable; but the price increased in a much more marked progression, for while tbe production has not doubled in twenty-three years, the value of the coal extracted has doubled in thirteen years. But is the source of this prodigious wealth inexhaustible, or wdl the day come when the earth wiU have given up all the treasures which it conceals in its bosom ? That is a question of the highest importance, which has occupied Parliament and the Press. Scientists, as usual, are divided into two factions. Some assert that at the rate England is going, she will soon exhaust her mines; the others maintain, with well-supported proofs, that the British coal-fields are practically inex haustible, and that they will last longer than the English nation itself. How can these GALILEE CHAPEL (DURHAM CaVTHEDRAL). gentlemen tell how long the British nation will last ? That is a statement they have not condescended to explain. At the bead of the pessimists was Professor Stanley Jevons, whose opinion was shared by Professor TyndaU, who goes so far as to declare that the destiny of England is inseparable from that of her coal-mines, and that the fortunes of the nation are not in the hands of her Statesmen, but of her coal owners ; and he concludes with these patriotic, but, let us hope, exaggerated words : \"While they are debating at Westminster, the life blood of the country runs away and is lost.\" It is, of course, understood that the blood is the coal. Nevertheless, they have done better than debate at Westminster : a Commission of Enquiry was nominated, and their report was most reassuring. Here, iu effect, is the estimate of the quantity of coal which can be extracted from the English mines \u2014 granting that a depth of 4,000 feet can be reached, beyond which it is estimated we cannot dig \u2014 the sum is 146,454,240,387 tons. But if, as some geologists affirm, we cannot penetrate lower than 2,500 feet, the quantity is proportionally diminished."], [47, "THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICTS. 35 For administrative purposes England is divided into nineteen coal districts, at the head of each of which is an inspector of mines nominated by the Government. The most important districts are those of Northumberland and Durham, which contain 368 mines, producing annually 35,000,000 tons of coal; of Yorkshire, where 562 mines furnish 15,000,000 tons; and Wales, whicli has 568 mines, producing at least as much. Northumberland, the most northern county of England, borders on Scotland, from which it is separated by the Tweed and by the Cheviot Hills, which cover a superficies of 90,000 acres, and whose highest point ot elevation is 2,658 feet above the level of the sea. On the east Northumberland is bounded by the North Sea, and on the south by Durham. Agriculture, upon these vast desolate Moors, blackened with coal dust and factory smoke, which destroy the vegetation, is but a secondary consideration. In a RABY CASTLE. superficial total of 1,250,000 acres, scarcely more than 150,000 are under cultivation, and 650,000 acres are pasture-lands. There the peculiar breed of sheep called mountain cheviots are reared, and are found as far as the north of Scotland. The remainder of the county is uncultivated, and principally composed of arid lands, clothed with a thin grass upon which feed numerous flocks of geese. The most picturesque portions of Northumberland are the mountainous districts bordering on Scotland, the valleys of the Coquet and the Tyne, the wooded hills about Alnwick, and the bold cliffs of the Coast. One of the curiosities of the county is the Roman Wall, which, starting from Wallsend, on the Tyne, in the environs of Newcastle, crosses England, and terminates at Bowness, on the Solway. This defence, which is sixty miles long, was built by Hadrian, and is composed of a Waall of stone, a ditch, and an earthwork in parallel lines. Constructed in nearly a straight line, it passes through the most diverse districts ; descends into valleys, scales hills, and crosses rivers on viaducts, of which there still remain traces at Chollesford. At intervals we still find fortresses or stations, of which the best preserved is that of Housesteads \u2014 this was a considerable camp, to judge from the ruins which cover nearly five acres of ground; and we may still perceive the remains of the gates and ramparts, as well as the large halls which served as guard-houses. 33"], [48, "THE PROVINCES. 36 Almost parallel to the WTall of Hadrian, at a part of its course, is the Tyne, which separates Northumberland from Durham, whose general aspect is monotonous and flat. It is only in the environs of Durham, the chief city of the county, and in the valleys of the Wear and the Tees, that we find any picturesque spots ; aU the northern part of this region being nothing but a vast uncultivated plain, covered with brushwood of a mournful and sombre hue. In the meadows and on the hills are excellent pasturages, where the fine races of cattle known as Durhams and short-horns are raised. The City of Durham is in a very remarkable situation. It is built upon a rocky eminence, a kind of peninsula formed by the Wear, the waters of which reflect the high towers of the cathedral and the walls of the castle. Viewed from a distance, the city presents an aspect perhaps unique in England. Rising from the water which bathes its walls, it is surrounded by a girdle of trees, whose green foliage brings out the sombre hue of the houses. The latter cling to the sides of the eminence which is crowned by the cathedral and the castle, the frowning mass of which rises perpendicularly from the Wear, and recalls the for ever vanished splendours of the old Bishops palatine of Durham, as well as the original purpose of the city \u2014 \" half a house of God, half a rampart against the Scotch.\" Durham is a fallen city, so there is but little to say concerning its present \u2014 all the interest centres in the cathedral and the castle. The cathedral is a monument of the 11th century, to which was added, a hundred years afterwards, a chapel called the Nine Altars, which replaced the primitive Norman apsis: its total length is 510 feet, and its width 170. The north towers are 130 feet high, and the centre one 214 feet. We enter the church by the north door, which possesses a beautiful Norman arch, and is furnished with a large iron hammer, which was used as a knocker by fugitives who wished to seek asylum. Internally, the nave presents the most beautiful specimen of Norman architecture in England. It is supported by splendid massive columns 24 feet in circumference with mouldings of varied designs. The western chapel, called \" Galilee,\" whose walls and foundations are embedded in the rock, is remarkable as an example of \" transition \" architecture, which succeeded to the Norman, and preceded the early English style. A quadruple range of columns, of exceeding richness of ornamentation, will be greatly admired, as well as a beautiful altar of blue marble, and the tomb of Bede; that of St. Cuthbert is in the chapel of the Nine Altars. In the choir the attention is particularly attracted by the magnificent sculptured stone reredos put up in 1380 by Lord Neville : this remarkable piece of sculpture, it seems, was executed in London. Separated from the cathedral by an open space called Palace Green, the old castle of the Bishops, converted into an University, presents to the spectator a picturesque facade, partly modern, with the exception of the entrance, which consists of a beautiful Norman arch. The most remarkable portions of this edifice are the chapel and the Norman galleries, the black staircase, and the great hall, adorned with portraits of the Bishops, and hung with old armour. The keep, of octagon shape, is a comparatively modern construction, built upon the old foundations. Some old streets and the pretty Prebend's Bridge, from which one can obtain a beautiful view of the cathedral and of the river, are, with the former and the castle,"], [49, "THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICTS. 37 the principal curiosities of Durham, whence one can make very interesting excursions in the valley of the Wear. About fourteen miles from Durham, beyond Bishop's Auckland \u2014 so called because it served as a residence for the Bishops of Durham \u2014 we find one of the most remarkable castles not only in the county but in England \u2014 Raby Castle, belonging to the Duke of Cleveland ; the ancient dwelling of the Nevilles, descendants of Gilbert de Neville, Admiral of the Fleet of Wilham the Conqueror. The castle still preserves its feudal aspect, and is, one may truly say, unique of its kind. Cf immense proportions, the imposing mass of its walls and towers of a gray tint are percep tible from afar, as the country is sparsely wooded, and it stands out clearly in front of the dark back ground of country. A wide terrace surrounds the buildings which enclose three interior courts, and leads to the entrance of the castle, where a surprise awaits the visitor. As a matter of fact, the carriage does not stop at the door of the great haU or vesti- BANKS OF THE WEAR, DURHAM. bule, but enters it ; and nothing is more curious than to see, in winter time, the unusual spectacle of a harnessed vehicle in the immense hall, in which two huge fires are burning, aud which is lighted by gas. The hall is the wonder of Raby Castle. This immense apartment, with a vaulted ceiling, supported by massive pillars, in which tbe footsteps of the horses and the grinding of the wheels of the carriage are echoed by the vaulted roof, presents a never-to-be-forgotten aspect, such as no other lordly mansion could offer. Above the vestibule is another hall, called the \" Hall of the Barons,\" the dimensions of which are 114 feet long and 33 feet wide. In the time of the Nevdles seven hundred knights sat there in council together, at one time. The apartments of the castle, decorated with lavish luxuriousness, and containing numerous objects of art, are furnished in modern style, and do not require any special description; the curiosities of Raby Castle being the two great halls and thc ancient exterior portions, walls, and towers, which are in a remarkable state of preservation. From the"], [50, "THE PROVINCES. 38 historical and picturesque points of view, there:, are few castles so interesting to visit and so beautiful to see. So far as regards lordly mansions, Durham has no need to be envious of Northumberland, for in both reside noble and ancient families, whose names are in everyone's mouth ; amongst others, the Selby family, whose proverbial pride has given rise to a local legend, which is too pretty for us to omit here. The country people will tell those who like to hear it that the Selbys are so proud that, at the time of the Flood, they had a boat of their own, so as to be under no obligation to Noah. From the short description that we have given of these two counties and of the city of Durham, the reader will perceive that agriculture and commerce have but a small share in their wealth, which is entirely due to the mines, that are contained in these districts, and particularly to coal-mines. The coal-fields of Northumberland and Durham extend from the Coquet, in the former county, to the Tees, in the latter. In the whole extent of this region one sees scarcely anything in any direction but high chimneys vomiting clouds of smoke and steam ; the air resounds with the clang of hammers, wielded by hundreds of men \u2014 dusky Cyclops with muscular arms and grimy faces, who are employed in the mines and forges : the ground appears an inextricable network of rails, on which glide long trains of trucks filled with coal. Drawn by stationary engines which are out of sight, these trains, which seem to have no motive power, come and go, stop, climb up the hill-sides, descend into the valleys, and appear to be gifted with intelligence. This is in the highest degree a curious spectacle, the cause of the continual movement being quite invisible. The noise made by the cords and chains, strained by the impulse of the engines in passing over the grinding pulleys, varied with the roaring of the steam and the metallic clang of the anvils, produces an indescribable and bewildering uproar. A coal-mine is entered by a shaft, tbe mouth of which is surrounded by a solid framework, furnished with pulleys, capstans, and machinery more or less complicated, by means of which the men descend into the mine. When we reach the bottom of the shaft we find ourselves in a chamber, from which galleries radiate in all directions, lighted by the lamps of the miners. At certain distances are columns or pillars of coal, uncut, which support the roof untd the seam is exhausted. The pillars are then removed, and the gallery falls in. All the passages are laid with rails, that serve to bring under the pit's-mouth the trucks of coal, which are drawn by small horses (shaggy animals with long manes), of whicli the greater number have never seen daylight. They are born, and live, and die in the mine. The ventilation of mines is a matter of the greatest importance, and is managed by means of two bores or shafts, one of which serves for the supply of air, and the other for the exhaustion of the water and foul air. The lives of the miners depend upon the more or less perfect working of these ventilators, and the means of driving the fresh air into all parts of the mine, which is accomplished by means of a series of traps, which open and shut automatically, in accordance with a very ingenious system. Lastly, the water is pumped out by steam engines, whicli work night and day. Notwithstanding all precautions, coal -mining is always attended with great danger,"], [51, "THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICTS. 39 and the explosions, landslips, and other accidents, are only too frequent. Very often, it must be confessed, the accidents are due to the imprudence of the miners themselves, who, in defiance of all laws and regulations, and for want of the simplest precautions or prudence, descend into the mines with matches, and go as far as to pick the locks of their safety-lamps, in order to light their pipes. The recklessness of these men is incredible, and almost every day some of them are brought before the police magistrates for infringing the regulations, but that does not seem to have any effect upon them. Since the Act of 1842, women are no longer employed in mines. To Lord Ashley, TOWERS OF RABY CASTLE. the late well-known Lord Shaftesbury, this reform is due. One must read the report of the Royal Commission to comprehend the horror and indignation which echoed through the whole country when the revolting details were read concerning tbe treatment of the women and children employed in the pits. Such barbarity never had been known. Children of four, five, and six years of age were forced to work in mines badly ventilated, and in which explosions frequently occurred. Women and young girls almost naked, their only clothing being a pair of drawers, were harnessed round the middle to the carts which they dragged, crawling oh all fours like dogs, so low were the galleries in"], [52, "THE PROVINCES. 40 which they worked. Oftentimes the corridors were inundated. In some mines the water reached up to their waists. And owners believed these unfortunate crea tures were well paid with two shillings a day ! Children were made to carry loads weighing a hundredweight or a hundred weight and a half. It was an organized system of slavery and immorality. We have already glanced at the costume of the women. That of the men was more simple still. With a view to be able to support the heat of the mine, into whicli very little fresh air ever penetrated, they adopted the dress of our first parents before the Fall. As soon as the question of cleansing these Augean stables arose \u2014 of snatch ing human beings from the rapa city of colliery owners who treated them worse than their beasts of burthen, the proprietors indulged in a chorus of complaints and re criminations. But public opinion was in favor of the Bill, which was naturally strongly opposed in the House of Lords. One of the members of that august assembly, the Marquis of Londonderry, him self a colliery owner, made him self conspicuous by the resistance which he opposed to the projected Act, and caused, without intend ing it, a very important clause to be added to the Bill. The Act authorized the Government to nominate in spectors of mines, and in com bating this measure Lord Londonderry, carried away by GOJN'G DOWN THE riT AFTER AJN EXPLOSION."], [53, "THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICTS. 41 the heat of debate, declared that for his part he would tell the inspectors that they could descend into the mines if they could, and once at the bottom they could remain there if they pleased\u2014 there was nothing in the law to force him to facilitate their ascent or SCENE AT THE PIT'S MOUTH AFTER AN EXPLOSION. descent ! The grave omission which the noble marquis called attention to was imme diately rectified, and he had the glory, which he did not expect nor seek, of arming the inspectors of mines with more extended powers, and obliging mine owners to afford"], [54, "THE PROVINCES. 42 them all necessary facilities in the performance of their duties. A few daiys afterwards the measure received the Royal assent, and Lord Ashley had the satisfaction and the everlasting honour of having delivered thousands of human beings from a horrible fate \u2014 a fate more terrible than death itself. The present condition of the miners is satisfactory. To the Act of 1842 have been added others relative to the treatment of workmen, the ventilation and sanitation of the mines, to the precautions which should be adopted to render explosions as infrequent as possible, and to insure the safety of the pitmen. A curious race these pitmen. They live and inter-marry amongst themselves ; and their customs differ from those of the agricultural population, with whom they do not cultivate any relations. The miner associates only with miners, and the daughter of a pitman would never think of finding a husband amongst the other working-classes. The pitmen are clothed in a waistcoat, and in trousers cut off at the knees ; their head cover ing is a round hat with a narrow brim in front and at the sides, and somewhat lengthened over the nape of the neck ; they wear thick woollen stockings, and with thick soles. In Durham and Northumberland the head-dress of the women consists of a handkerchief tied under the chin. Like the sailor's wife, the pitman's spouse lives m continual anxiety and dread : the miner risks his life as much as the sailor \u2014 he is at the mercy of a land-slip, an explosion, an inundation, of all those terrible catastrophes which render the existence of the toilers of the land as precarious as that of the \" toilers of the sea.\" On Friday and Saturday \u2014 pay days \u2014 the miner, to use his own expression, \"tacks about,\" and gives himself up to drinking. Nevertheless, amongst the pitmen drunken ness is far from being so common as amongst workmen in general. On Sundays and holidays the miner is dressed all in his best, resplendent in a staring coloured waistcoat, with a flower in his button-hole ; and he goes to a place of worship, for he is religious, and almost always belongs to a Dissenting sect. Sometimes, too, he preaches in the streets of his village, and the crowd presses around him, open-mouthed, listening eagerly to the sentences which he launches forth with the energy which characterises all his acts. Many men play pitch and toss, losing or winning sums relatively large : they are gamblers \u2014 that is their greatest fault. In their homes the miners delight to surround themselves with comforts; their cottages, only one storey high, solidly furnished, with articles of good quality, often in mahogany, are well kept and scrupulously clean. As to their food, it is very substantial, as is necessary for people who are compelled to work so hard. Nevertheless, they have meat only once a day, with the addition of potatoes, and suet dumplings, which they eat at the commencement of their repast. Their chief beverage is beer or ale, of which they consume immense quantities. The work in the mines is continuous. The pitmen are divided into fore-shift men, who work at night, and back-shift men, who work during the day ; besides the men who are occupied in the interior of the mines, there are numbers who are employed on the surface. All of them are engaged by the year by a proper contract, signed by them and their employers. The steam-engines, and the constant supervision which is necessary to exercise in the working of the mines, necessitate the employment of a"], [55, "THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICTS. 43 considerable staff, of whom the hewers are a minority. In a mine which employs 500 workmen, for instance, there are scarcely more than 140 hewers; the remainder are employed in dragging the trucks, screening the coal, clearing the rails for the passage of the trains, tending the engines and pumps, cleaning and looking after the lamps and horses, or compose the administrative staff. Accidents, less frequent than formerly, are still common enough, and cost 1,000 lives every year. Explosions are the most frequent cause of accidents, and of 1,000 deaths 700 are due to fire-damp. Statistics fix the number of deaths by accident in the mines as 163 per 1,000. The annals of coal-mining preserve the melancholy records of fearful catastrophes, of which coal-mines have been the theatres. One of the most terrible was that in the Hartley colliery, in Northumberland, in which 219 workmen perished on the 16th of January, 1862. The beam of the pumping engine broke, and dragged away in its fall the wooden casing which protected the sides of the shaft, and blocked it up. It was not until eight days had elapsed, notwith standing the greatest exer tions, that the rescue-party reached the place where lay the bodies of the unfortunate THE PIT'S MOUTH. miners, asphyxiated for want of air, at a depth of 600 feet below the surface. There is no more affecting sight than that which a mine presents immediately after an accident. The women dishevelled, wild with agony of mind, precipi tate themselves towards the shafts, the approaches to which are guarded, are loud in their lamentations and weeping, and abandon themselves to the most poignant grief at the sight of the dead body of a father, a husband, or a son. Even for the hardest and most self-contained man, the sight of the human forms, indistinguishable, covered with cloths, landed on the brink of the shaft from the trollies which serve to bring up the coal, is one of the most harrowing that it is possible to witness. It is a spectacle which will never be forgotten by anyone who has been so unfortunate as to be present at it. One of the most interesting mines in the county of Durham is Pemberton, near Sunderland. It is 1,794 feet deep\u2014 the deepest mine in existence. It was necessary, before reaching the working levels, to pierce the chalk-beds to a depth of 300 feet, and to line the shaft with iron to prevent the irruption of the water. It was only after 34"], [56, "THE PROVINCES. 44 twenty years that the coal-beds were reached, which extend beneath the bed of the River W;ear, and of which the output is, on the average, nearly 1,000 tons a day. They have succeeded in raising a trolly, filled with coal, from the bottom of the shaft to the surface, in less than a minute. The temperature of the Pemberton pit is 87\u00b0, and the barometer therein stands at 32-80. One can easily imagine that, under such conditions, the work of the pitmen is hard and fatiguing. The sight of the subter ranean galleries is most interesting, and it is not without some inward trepidation that the visitor penetrates thus into the bowels of the earth, and even under the sea; for in one or two of the Durham mines there are galleries which extend many miles beneath the German Ocean. So we can very well appreciate the exclamation of the Emperor of Russia, Alexander the First, who, on arriving at the brink of the shaft of a mine at Wallsend, near Newcastle-on-Tyne, cried, \" Ah, mon Dieu ! it is the mouth of hell. One must be mad to venture down there ! \" And, quickly doffing the miner's garments which he had put on, according to custom, he declined to descend into the shaft. From the mine the coal is carried to the port of shipment, by railway nearly always, sometimes in barges. On the Tyne and the Wear these boats, of peculiar construction, are known as \"keels,\" and their navigators as \"keelmen.\" These individuals, like the pitmen, form a fraternity of their own, which is gradually disappearing, in consequence of the great facilities which the numerous railways that penetrate the coal districts offer for the transport of the mineral. All the coal dug from the mines in this district is shipped at Hartlepool, Sunderland, and (chiefly) at Newcastle. \"To carry coals to Newcastle\" is an old English saying, which is exactly equivalent to the French expression, \" To carry water to tbe river.\" Now, no river, with the exception of the Manzanares, ever is in want of water. Newcastle has no lack of coal. It is, in fact, the greatest coal depot in England, after Cardiff, which was not in existence when the proverb was originated \u2014 a circumstance which would prove, once more, if proof were needed, that one cannot think of everything, and that the wisdom of nations is sometimes at fault. In 1882 there were exported from Newcastle 4,557,277 tons of coal, representing a value of \u00a31,852,322 sterling. Hartlepool comes next, from which 563,315 tons, valued at \u00a3237,G31 were dispatched; and, lastly, Sunderland, the principal shipping port for the coal from the valley of the Wear. The coal basin of Yorkshire, the extent of which, according to Mr. Hull, is 760 square miles, and which contained in 1857 only 347 collieries, producing about 9,000,000 tons of coal, reckons at present 562 coal mines, which supply more than 15,000,000 tons. This basin does not cease within the limits of the county, but extends into Derbyshire, where are found nearly 300 collieries, less rich and less productive than those of Yorkshire. The greater portion of the coal extracted in this region is used in the numerous factories and foundries which are situated in the district. Bradford, Leeds, Sheffield, Halifax, Middlesbrough, and Huddersfield consume prodigious quantities of it. So the exportation of the coal from there is less considerable than from the northern counties. The two most important ports in Yorkshire, Hull and"], [57, "THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICTS. 45 Goole, only send abroad about 1,000,000 tons, representing a value of \u00a3461,470 sterling (1882). It was in this county, at the Ardsley Colliery, that the most frightful accident ever remembered occurred. On the 12th December, 1866, an explosion caused the death of more than 300 miners, and next day their comrades, to the number of about thirty, who volunteered to go in search of them were killed by a second explosion which raised the number of victims to 358.

The Principality of Wales is as undulating and picturesque as the counties of which we have just been speaking are monotonous and flat. It is divided into two parts \u2014 Nortli and South Wales. Both districts present a succession of beautiful and varied views : mountains, desert plains, wooded hills, lakes, rivers, and torrents meandering through luxurious valleys, the general appearance of which are suggestive of Switzer land. South Wales is a miniature of the land of William Tell, mingled with poetry and Breton traditions. The cromlechs, the menhirs, the rocking-stones, which we meet with in every direction, add to the resemblance, even as the language. The spirit of superstition, which is rife in the remote villages, presents a striking parallel to the manners and customs of Brittany, and suffice, in default of other testimony, to fix the common origin of the two countries. Music and poetry rank high in the estimation of the Wrelsh. Every year there are assemblies for music and national poetry, which are called \" Eisteddfodd.\" Now-a-days, it is unusual to find Welshmen who do not speak English; hut not very long ago it was absolutely indispensable, if one went into certain districts whither the railroad, and with it civilization, had not penetrated, to have a certain knowledge of the Welsh language, in which consonants play such an important part, and the pronunciation of which defies the most experienced linguists. How, without being accustomed to it from infancy, could one pronounce such words as these names of places in the country \u2014 Llwyngwychyr, or Cillwch, or, yet again, Cwmddawdwr? The Basque peasants affirm that the Devil, after living in their country seven years, had not learnt more than two words of the language. It is possible that in Wales his Satanic majesty would not have made any greater progress. Notwithstanding their love for the harp, we must not put the Welsh down as either"], [58, "THE PROVINCES. 46 saints, or as geniuses because they possess vivid imaginations\u2014 too vivid, indeed ! This vivacity of mind is one of the greatest faidts of these good people, who accept dreams for facts, and do not exactly consider that there is something reprehensible in lying.

So, at least, declared a judge from the Bench, when pre siding at a local sessions in 1883, after stating that RAGLAN CASTLE. it was impossible to give credit to the evidence of the witnesses. This is, unfortunately, not a solitary instance. Lying is a vice of which the Welsh do not understand the gravity. Very rich in coal, iron, copper, and lead-mines, the principality is first of all an industrial centre : agriculture, long neglected, is still, comparatively"], [59, "THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICTS. 47 speaking, behind the age, although it has recently been brought to perfection under the auspices of some large landed proprietors. In the mountainous districts, where land is unproductive, the only resource of the farmers is cattle raising. The coal basin of South Wales, which is much the most important, extends along the course of the Bristol Channel, from the Usk on the east, to the confines of Pembroke shire on the West, and its average width is about twenty miles. It covers an area of more than 900 square miles. There are, including those in Monmouthshire, 534 collieries, from which every year more than 17 millions of tons of coal are extracted. ' It is in the vales of the Neath, the Taff, and the Bhondda, and in the environs of Merthyr Tydvil that the carboniferous deposits are found in the greatest abundance. The best known mines are those of Risca, Tredegar, Rhondda, aud Mountain Ash. This last-named mine supplies coal to the French navy. Situated at a depth of 360 feet, the seam is so abundant that more than 1,000 tons of coal are ex tracted daily, and two and a half tons of coal can be brought to the pit's mouth in about one minute. The superficial extent of the Mountain Ash Colliery is 25 acres ; the average thickness of the seam is four feet. The coal is almost smokeless, which renders it very valuable for war steamers. The exportation of coal from these districts is principally carried on from Swansea and Cardiff, whence in 188.2 was exported 5,973,433 tons, of a value of \u00a3'3,000,000 sterling. Swansea exported 1 ,260,000 tons, representing \u00a3680,000. monmouth. The importance that the English attach to these mines of black diamonds is not excessive ; it is to the coal that they owe in a great measure the prosperity of their manufactures, which all depend on the cheap production of the fuel which feeds the furnaces. The manufactories alone absorb 69 per cent, of the coal produced, and every year the output is increased to meet the increasing wants of the works. Perfected machinery has a greater tendency to supersede manual labor, and the consumption of coal follows in a marked and constant increase. So the anxiety of some scientific men will be easily comprehended, as they foresee the time when, in default of coal, British industries and its millions of machines will suddenly be stopped like the wheels of a watch of which the mainspring is broken.

And that is the reason why if they bad coal sufficient for a hundred years, instead of for many centuries, they would not trouble themselves any more or less. They prefer to count upon the progress and the enterprise of their descendants, rather than to dwell upon melancholy predictions. They have faith in thc future of their race, and delight to conjure up the vision of a good time coming, in which their descen dants will make use of the forces of nature at present unknown, as steam and electricity were unknown to their forefathers. Quitting the region of mines, forges, and foundries, of which Merthyr Tydvil is the BRIDGE AND CATHEDRAL, HEREFORD. centre, and returning to Newport, the tourist who may be desirous to visit the most important places in this part of South Wales before proceeding to the North has, so to speak, only the embarrassment of choice. On leaving Newport, the railway passes near Caerleon, the Isca Silurum of Antoninus, which is now but an unimportant village, after having been the station of the Second Boman Legion and the capital of South Wales. Much more interesting are the ruins of B,agian Castle, situated in the beautiful valley of the Usk, in the middle of an undulating and well wooded district. The Castle, partly hidden by trees, stands upon a rising ground, about two thirds of a mile from the village of Raglan. It is reached by means of a bridge over the moat, leading to the arched gateway, flanked by two hexagonal machicolated towers. Comparatively"], [62, "THE PROVINCES. 50 modern, since it only dates from the reign of Henry V., this castle marks by the details of its architecture the transition of the Feudal fortresses to the fortifications of the new school. Its angular towers, offering little surface for cannon-balls, are like a LUDLOW CASTLE. rough outline of the bastions of our own day. The Keep, a lofty and massive hexagonal tower, surrounded by a wide moat, dismantled by order of Cromwell, presents a yawning aperture, disclosing the staircase, which escaped destruction. From the summit of the Keep a magnificent view of the surrounding country can be obtained, and the Sugar Loaf Mountain beyond Abergavenny, aswell as \"The Kymin,\" a wooded hill overlooking"], [63, "THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICTS. 51 Monmouth, can be distinguished. Contrary to custom, the Donjon Keep of Raglan is outside the Castle itself, and formed an advanced work, intended to protect the principal fortress, with which it was connected by a covered way and drawbridge. Destroyed during the Civil War and neglected by its owners, the Castle seemed for a long while delivered over to the Vandalism of the peasantry of the district, who built their houses of the stones they fetched from its walls. At length the Duke of Beaufort, to whom it belongs, put an end to these depredations, and now the venerable ruins of Baglan Castle are jealously protected, and carefully kept in order. Some miles from Raglan we find the old town of Monmouth, situated on the bank of the Wye, and enclosed by picturesque hills one of which (\" The Kymin \") is 700 feet above the river ; from the summit of this hill a superb panorama of the Valley of the Wye is obtainable \u2014 one of the most beautiful views in tbe United Kingdom. Monmouth it self presents no objects of interest, relatively, and has no monuments except the old gate leading to the bridge across the Monnow, whose waters here unite with the Wye, and the unimportant ruins of a castle and a priory where Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote the poem of the Round Table, which was subsequently translated into French verse by two Norman troubadours. The visitor is shown a window which tradition says was SAINT ASAPH. that of his chamber, but it is evidently of a period later than that in which Geoffrey lived. Monmouth is more especially noticeable as the starting-point of tourists desirous to explore the Valley of the Wye, which between Ross and Monmouth presents a variety of sites of remarkable beauty. Between these two towns the river describes numerous curves, returning upon its course, and lingering at pleasure amid these beautiful scenes, which it seems to part from with regret. Its winding course lies deep between two high gently undulating plateaux ; sometimes its rapid waters lave grassy meadows, sometimes they wind around the bases of lofty hills, like Symond's Yat, or the Dowards, chalky masses, 600 feet high, thus presenting a variety of aspects in which rich vegetation succeeds arid plains and rocks, whose summits and sides are clothed with ivy and wild flowers. Here we have the picturesque ruins of a castle of the Middle Ages, or of a Roman stronghold j there, a granite wall whose surface presents enormous yawning clefts; farther on, a beautiful park shows us a wide carpet of verdure; farther still are pretty little villages embosomed in orchards ; well tilled fields, or pasturages in which wander herds of cattle. When ascending the river, as soon as Goodrich Castle is passed, the banks assume a less picturesque appearance ; soon afterwards Ross is reached \u2014 a 3S"], [64, "THE PROVINCES. 52 town well situated upon a gentle eminence. At Ross there is nothing remarkable : this little town has no history, and the only curiosity it can offer to the tourist is the spectacle of two trees growing inside the church. From Ross, the railroad, skirting the borderland between England and Wales, goes Northward to Chester, passing Hereford, Ludlow, and Shrewsbury. Hereford, the chief town of the county of that name, is famous for its pretty situation on the Wye, and for its cathedral\u2014 a most interesting sacred edifice, which the successive and maladroit restorations of many architects have not been able to deprive of its character of majestic beauty. The most remarkable portions of the building are the south aisle, the choir, of Norman architecture, the altar, the nave\u2014 embellished by a beautiful modern screen of wrought iron \u2014 and the cloisters. In these different parts of the edifice are numerous tombs, some of which, dating from the 14th century, are curious. Hereford Cathedral also contains a library, in which are preserved some 2,000 volumes, and priceless Anglo-Saxon MSS. Nell Gwynne, the mistress of Charles IL, the celebrated rival of the Duchess of Portsmouth, the lively actress of whom Madame de Sevigue has left such a piquant portrait, was born in Hereford, as well as Garrick the actor, who came into the world in a house in Widemarsh Street. The old houses in the town are gradually disappearing to make room for new buildings, and lovers of the picturesque must console themselves at Shrewsbury and Ludlow. Situated at the confluence of the Teme and Corve, Ludlow is built, in amphitheatre form, upon a wooded hill. At the top of this hill, and dominating all the town, stands the high tower of the parish church of St. Lawrence, a remarkable specimen of the Perpendicular style, built in the 13th and enlarged in the following century _ Skilfully restored in 1860, it consists of a large nave and a choir, the windows of which are filled with beautiful stained glass. In the neighbouring cemetery we remark a curious house of the 17th century, possessing a frontage embellished with projecting beams, all sculptured and carved ; it is one of the most beautiful examples of ancient domestic architecture in the district, of which Ludlow presents many specimens, notably the Feathers Hotel, which is considered a model of this kind of decoration. But all these buildings are, in interest, far behind the ruins of Ludlow Castle, the most important of the fortified castles which protected the Welsh marches. Built in the 12th century, by Roger de Montgomery, Earl of Shrewsbury, this fortress sustained many sieges and witnessed many a battle. Later on, it became the official residence of the Lords President of Wales, and was abandoned at the end of the 17th century, when the office of Lord President was abolished. The appearance of the ruins is imposing ; one only perceives the summits of the embattled towers and of the keep, rising above the triple enceinte, which is concealed by a curtain of verdure. The ruined walls, whose angles are rounded by Time, are clothed with luxurious vegetation ; the ivy and moss wrap them, as it were, in a cloak of dark green, but they ill conceal the gaps which centuries have made. As soon as we have reached the court-yard, the keep meets our gaze, massive and sombre, overlooking the vast buildings of various periods, successively erected by the ancient"], [65, "THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICTS. 53 possessors of Ludlow. Here is a great hall or council chamber, with pointed windows and broken mullions. There is a chapel, a kind of round tower, the doors and windows HOUSES IN BUTCHER'S ROW (SHREWSBURY). of which, plainly arched, denote their Norman origin. In front is a square building which served as the kitchen. In the great hall, the roof of which is dilapidated, was first represented the \"Comus\" of Milton, who, as a guest of the Lord President, composed this comedy or masque to please the chatelaines of the district, who had assembled at Ludlow Castle where the Earl of Bridgewater was entertaining a merry"], [66, "THE PROVINCES. 54 company. It was also at Ludlow that Butler wrote the first part of his \" Hudibras.\" From the historical stand-point, the castle is teeming with memories. Edward IV. and his chddren, and Gloucester, their uncle, who caused them to be murdered in the Tower, all lived here ; and Arthur, Prince of Wales, died here, a short time after his marriage with Catherine of Aragon. Shrewsbury is mid-way between Hereford and Chester. The situation of the ancient capital of Shropshire vividly recalls that of Durham. Like Durham, it is built upon a peninsula, formed, in this instance, by the Severn. The railway passes at the base of the castle, of which now there remain only the square keep and a portion of the old interior enceinte. Erected upon the summit of the eminence on which the town is built, this castle, which can be perceived from afar (Shrewsbury stands in the midst of a vast plain) , gives a feudal air to the old and picturesque town. The spire of St. Mary's Church, which uprises high in the centre of the town, looks like the gigantic mast of a ship. This church, though of different periods and various styles, is nevertheless a remarkable monument. The castle and the church, however, yield in interest to the old houses of Shrewsbury, which are the delight of the artist and the curious. In the High Street and in Butcher's Row we find the most remarkable of these gabled buildings, with their pointed roofs and overhanging storeys, which shade the dirty, narrow streets, the aspect of which has scarcely changed since the 15th century. There are the same penthouses sheltering shops, with wooden pillars, arched windows, the frames of which, like the doors, are projecting, and present opportunities for decoration ; in some cases, indeed, the frames are carved ; the exterior beams are blackened by the weather, and arranged in lozenges, crosses, or squares, which are worked in, like the meshes of a net, on the frontages, and stand out against the grey masonry. All this has a stamp of the Middle Ages, as unexpected as interesting, and much more pleasant to look at than the school founded by Edward VI., a massive building of the 16th century, with windows wider than they are high, and an embattled tower with pinnacles. At the foot of the hill, the banks of the Severn, shaded by fine trees, enclose Shrewsbury with a rampart of verdure, and form a very pleasant promenade, called the \" Quarry Walk ; \" which still more accentuates the resemblance between Shrewsbury and Durham tbat we have already noticed. Chester, the ancient Castrum Leyionis of the Romans \u2014 then Castrum, the camp par excellence, whence its name \u2014 is the first of the chain of fortresses formerly ranged upon the frontiers of England and Wales, and which extended from the Dee, in the north, to the Severn in the south. A military station of the greatest importance, and considered, in past days, as the key of North Wales, Chester still preserves traces of its origin : its four principal streets, for instance, start from the centre of the city, aud diverge to the four cardinal points, recalling, accurately, the arrangements of the Roman camps. The ramparts also display some evidences of Roman masonry ; one instance, the best preserved of the constructions of that period, is a hypocaust situated in the rear of a house in Bridge Street. Another specimen was discovered, but was demolished and reconstructed in the garden of the Museum. As is St. Malo, in France, so is Chester surrounded by ramparts, on which one may compass the city on foot ; these form the favourite promenade of the inhabitants. The walls form an almost perfect"], [67, "THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICTS. 55 \u25a0 parallelogram, cut at intervals by towers, the most remarkable of which are on the north side; amongst others, the Ph\u0153nix Tower, from the summit of which Charles I. witnessed the rout of his army in the plains of Row- ton Moor, as an inscription placed above the gate declares ; then we have the Bonwal desthorne and the Water Towers, placed a little in front of the walls, which were built in 1322.

Chester is still a port, but the business is not great. An excellent starting-point from which to explore North Wales, the old city is in itself a place at once most interesting and pioturesque. The narrow streets of the old quarters of the town are lined with ancient houses, the fronts of which, with wooden balconies and carved galleries and small beams ingeniously placed, so as to furnish an element of decoration of which the architects of the 17th century knew how to make an excellent use, are for the most part very remarkable. To enhance the effect of these buildings, the streets of Chester are arranged in a manner which one does not meet with elsewhere.

Near to Chester are found two mansions, both interesting on different grounds. One, Eaton Hall, is the sumptuous dwelling of the Duke of Westminster. It is a modern building, situated in the midst of a beautiful park. Like all English noblemen, the Duke opens his mansion to the public at certain times. Each visitor pays a shilling entrance fee ; at the end of the year these contributions amount to a considerable sum, which the noble owner sends to the Hospital at Chester, which from this source received"], [71, "THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICTS. 59 iu 1884, \u00a3500 sterling; so Eaton Hall must be visited by at least 10,000 people annually. The other mansion is that of Hawarden, the dwelling-place of the venerable Mr. Gladstone, the eminent statesman and head of the Liberal party. The castle is a budding of the last century, restored in 1809, so as to give it the appearance of a building of the 13th century. In the park which surrounds the mansion are the ruins of a castle ofthe llth century (Hawarden Castle). Hawarden is not in Cheshire, but in Flintshire : that is to sav. in WalPS properly so called. Nevertheless, if Chester, Hereford, and Monmouth are not now parts of Wales, they were formerly Welsh ; Here fordshire and Monmouth shire were the only counties which the Saxons were able to con quer and keep. North Wales is one of the most^B^H picturesque districts that can be imagined^ Mountains and valleys, lakes and plains, moorlands and marshes, succeed each other in a never-ending panorama. To the beauties of nature are added the memories of the peoples who have successively inhabited the country from prehistoric times to the present epoch. Here are deep moats and stone walls of enormous height; cromlechs and Druidic RAMPARTS OF CHESTEU remains ; abbeys and cathedrals in ruins ; castles of which only walls and gaping towers remain ; Cimri, Romans, Saxons, Gauls, and English disputed in turn for the posses sion of this country, which, taken and retaken, passed from one to the other, while retaining traces of the domination of all. Quitting Cheshire, we penetrate Denbighshire, the chief town of which, Denbigh, is situated on an eminence which is crowned by the few remaining ruins of its old castle. As a matter of fact, there only remain a few feet of dilapidated wall, and a gate flanked by two towers. From the top of the hill is visible the whole of the valley of the Clwyd, which extends like an immense circus, in which the blue mountains form gigantic steps. About six miles from Denbigh we find the little town of St. Asaph, whose cathedial \u2014 a monument of the 8th century \u2014 is the smallest in England and Wales : it only measures 182 feet by 68 feet. The seat of a bishopric founded by St. Mungo in tlie 6th century, St. Asaph is an insignificant little borough containing 3,500 inhabitants. A branch railway connects Denbigh and St. Asaph with the main Chester and Holyhead line, whicli is the route to Ireland. The latter railway skirts the wide estuary of the Dee, the Irish Sea, and the Bay of Beaumaris, ou its way to its western 36"], [72, "THE PROVINCES. 60 terminus in the Isle of Anglesey, crossing the Menai Straits by and through a wonderful tubular bridge. At first the railroad traverses an uninteresting district, and with the exception of the rains of Flint Castle, the tourist perceives nothing but factory, foundry, and brewery chimnevs, which are plentiful in this district. At Holywell is a spring whose waters have, so 'tis said, as marvellous properties as those of Lourdes. Soon afterwards we lose sight of the Dee and reach the sea coast once more in the environs of Rhyl, where the waves lave the base of the embankment in a silver fringe. The sea in its turn is quitted, and the train rattles over the Conway on, or rather, in, the famous tubular bridge. But before penetrating this tube of Stephenson's, we can see in the left distance the summit of Snowdon, the culminating point of the chain of hills which extends from Conway to Nevin, by Carnarvon Bay, after having divided Carnarvonshire into two parts. The Conway Tubular Bridge, constructed in 1847, is 400 feet long, and crosses in a single span the Conway river. It is composed of two long square iron tubes, some thing in the shape of an iron railway carriage de tached from its wheels and PENRHYN CASTLE. lengthened ; for, although they appear absolutely square, the tubes are somewhat curved on the upper sides. It is considered a triumph of engineering skill. That may be, but it is certainly very ugly. The Suspension Bridge, constructed by Telford in 1822, is, on the contrary, a very graceful object, describing an elegant curve, and docs not detract from the remarkable view presented by the town and castle of Conway. Conway, or Aberconway, is a small town, of which one need see but the exterior ; but this exterior is of assured picturesqueness. Built in the form of an irregular triangle, upon a small eminence, it is surrounded by a girdle of embattled ramparts. At the angle which the Conway makes with the river Griffin stands the castle, built in the 13th century, by Edward I., to defend the entrance to the estuary. It is in the form of a parallelogram, and its walls, which are of great thickness, are surmounted by eight massive round towers. The railway, after quitting the tubular bridge, runs at the foot of the castle wall, crosses the enceinte of the town twice, and emerges into the country, skirting the Bay"], [73, "THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICTS. 61 of Beaumaris, on the other side of which is the Isle of Anglesey, a kind of plateau of little elevation, separated from the mainland by a cataclysm, and consisting of plains and pasture-land and corn-fields. Trees are rare in the island, the violent storms whicli sweep over these coasts not being conducive to. the growth of vegetation; nevertheless, there are some comparatively fertile valleys in Anglesev. Beaumaris, the capital of the island (thc houses arc perceptible in the distance), is ou the opposite bank, and is a pretty little town, built in the form of an amphitheatre, on the Menai Strait. In summer it is a much frequented watering-place. From the MENAI SUSPENSION BRIDGE. shore and from the terraces above it, iu the direction of the town, one enjoys an excellent view of the strait, which cuts off Puffin Island from the coast of Anglesey, and the promontory of Orme's Head from the opposite side. Penmaen-Mawr, a kind of granite buttress of the Snowdon range, through which the railway penetrates by a tunnel, rises on the right. Farther away, Bangor and Penrhyn appear, backed by the mountains of Carnarvonshire, whose blue summits mingle in the distance with the azure sky. We soon arrive at Bangor, nestling coquettishly at the bottom of a charming valley, sheltered by two ranges of rocks. This small town, the site of a very ancient bishopric, possesses only one monument \u2014 its cathedral, a very simple edifice of various styles, restored in 1870. Bangor is the principal head-quarters of tourists, from whence it is easy to visit the surrounding districts, which abound with interesting places, and in curiosities of all kinds."], [74, "THE PROVINCES. 62 The magnificent Penrhyn Castle, belonging to Lord Penrhyn, is amongst the \"lions\" of the neighbourhood. The English bestow this name upon places, houses castles, or on any remarkable thing in a town, or in any place whatsoever. It is situated in the midst of a beautiful park six and a half miles in circumference, and consists ot an extensive range of build.ngs supported by seven high towers, of which five are round, and two square; one of the latter is copied from that of Rochester Castle. The magnificent apartments are furnished and decorated with a luxury and richness quite unusual. Lord Penrhyn, who owns about 44,000 acres in Carnarvonshire and Denbigh- CARNARVON CASTLE. shire, is the proprietor of the extensive Penrhyn slate-quarries, the largest in the United Kingdom, from which he draws an immense revenue. These quarries (more \" lions ! \") employ 3,000 workmen, and sustain more than 12,000 people. The slate-cutting is conducted with the greatest skill, and it is calculated that 200 tons of Penrhyn slates are daily despatched from Bangor. The miners live in the neighbourhood, chiefly in the village of Bethesda, of which they form almost the sum total of the population. About a mile and a half from Bangor we meet with two bridges \u2014 the Suspension and the Britannia Tubular Bridges \u2014 which span the Menai Strait. This piece of water, which divides Anglesey from Wales, is about fourteen miles long ; its width varies between 190 and 3,200 yards. Before 1826 the Strait was crossed in boats, and some danger was incurred in the transit, particularly in bad weather. The Suspension Bridge, like that at Conway, was built by Telford, and cost \u00a3120,000. It is much higher than the Conway Bridge, for it was necessary to keep the navigation of"], [75, "THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICTS. 63 the Strait clear. The roadway of the bridge is 100 feet above the level of high water. In construction, the two bridges resemble each other; but the Menai Bridge, which measures 579 feet from one abutment to the other, and 1,000 feet in its total 'length, is the longer of the two. At a short distance from the Suspension Bridge the Britannia tubes cross the strait. This bridge is supported by three lofty and massive towers in masonry, one on each bank, and one built upon a rock in mid-channel which furnishes an excellent natural foundation. It is like the Conway Tubular Bridge, of which it is an enlarged copy, and is 1,842 feet long. On the Anglesey side, between the bridges, is a lofty column erected to the memory of the Marquis of Anglesey, who lost a leg at VALE OF LLANBERIS. Waterloo \u2014 an incident which gave rise to the saying that he had one foot in the grave for many years before he died. This joke is not perhaps of extreme point, but it is local ; let us note it as we pass, without comment. From Bangor to Carnarvon is about nine miles. The railway carries us thither in half an hour and skirts the strait. Carnarvon, or Caernarvon, is the most convenient point from which to reach Llanberis and make the ascent of Snowdon. Just as Beaumaris Castle defends the northern entrance of the strait, so does Carnarvon Castle protect the southern side ; but the former is just as insignificant as the latter is important. The town was founded by Edward I. in 1283 ; it is the capital of Carnarvonshire, the most mountainous county in Wales, and which has preserved the type of originality and nationality in a marked degree. All the inhabitants speak the Welsh language, and wear the national costume which, for women, consists chiefly of a horrible high-crowned"], [76, "THE PROVINCES. 64 hat of a most unbecoming character. It is impossible to picture to one's self a pretty face under this cvlinder fixed on a plate. Carnarvon is a fortified town, encompassed by ramparts which are united with the beautiful castle whose ruins are reckoned amongst the most magnificent in Wales This fortress, like that of Conway, is an irregular parallelogram, formed by thick, high walls, flanked bv thirteen massive towers, of which one, the Eagle's tower, the largest and the most beautiful, is surmounted by three battlemented turrets. To judge well of the proportions of the castle and of the aspect of the old town, whose limits are clearly indicated by the walls ofthe enceinte, there is no more advantageous point of view than thp summit of the Eagle's Tower, from which the eye embraces Carnarvon, the Strait, a considerable portion of the mountain-chain which crosses Carnarvonshire, and the summit of Snowdon, which dominates it. Carnarvon is only half an hour by railway from Llanberis, the starting point of tourists who wish to visit the Lakes and make the ascent of Snowdon. As the railway quits the town it offers nothing of much interest. At some distance the country becomes more varied and hilly. Soon we skirt Llyn Padarn. From this point the moun tains, fringed with blue, stand up boldly upon the horizon, enclosing a beautiful panorama, in which the lakes, the fantastically shaped boulders, the cascades and the streams, succeed each other in endless and picturesque con- LAKE PERIS. fusion. It is a spectacle of sublime grandeur, and the pen is powerless to depict the striking effect, the profound impression, which is produced upon the spectator by this charming corner of the world. To Lake Padarn succeeds Lake Peris, a much smaller but much more beautiful piece of water. It is surrounded by high hills, which seem to rise out of the water, and by reflection in it produce shadows of singular effect. These lakes, of great depth, are separated by a narrow meadow, which is irrigated by a little water-course, a kind of connecting link between Llyn Padarn and Llyn Peris. Snowdon is accessible from many sides, but the Llanberis route is that which is generally followed, being the least dangerous and fatiguing. Formerly the ascent presented some difficulties, but a road was made that ponies \u2014 which replace the mules of Alpine districts \u2014 can easily follow to the summit of the mountain; the route, passing near the beautiful cascade of Ceunant Mawr, which tumbles noisily over a cliff 210 feet high into a black and rocky basin, is continued along a ridge which overlooks the Valley of Llanberis, and is almost straight until within a mile of the summit, when it makes a sharp curve. Thc ascent then becomes more tiresome, and we at length"], [77, "THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICTS. 65 reach the top of Snowdon, called Y Wyddfa. Then we find ourselves upon a narrow plateau, about eighteen feet in diameter, surrounded by a low wall. It is difficult to give an an idea of the magnificent view which is presented to the gaze of the bewildered tourist. Westward \u2014 that is to say towards Carnarvon \u2014 the Isle of Anglesey separates the Irish Sea from the Bay of Carnarvon ; beyond, the waves of the sea are perceptible \u2014 always a little rough on this side. In clear weather, a dark line is seen in the distance like a cloud of smoke; that is the Wicklow mountain-chain in Ireland. To the north, SNOWDON. east, and south the Welsh mountains are at first clearly distinguished, then their contours fade away and mingle with the horizon, intersected here and there by some peak higher than its fellows \u2014 Moel Siabod or Cader Idris for example. And on all sides except the east the perspective is bounded by the sea, smooth or rough, blue or fringed with foam, calm, or dashing furiously against the rocks which form, on the western coast of England, a natural breakwater. Between the northern slopes of Snowdon and the southern slopes of Glyder-Fawr, we find the Pass of Llanberis \u2014 a natural narrow passage, shut in between two high walls of basalt, whose rugged sides are scarped into points and peaks. At the bottom of the gorge a torrent rushes against the enormous masses of rock hurled into it pell-mell by some convulsion of nature, and loses itself in Llyn Peris. One of these"], [78, "THE PROVINCES. 66 boulders has the form of a Druidical stone, of the kind to which the term \" Cromlech \" has been applied.

Not far from the viUage is the celebrated gorge of Aber glaslyn, watered by an impetuous torrent, which is spanned by a bridge of one arch, that unites the counties of Carnarvon and Merioneth. From Beddgelert to Carnarvon the most rapid and agreeable mode of communication is the railway, and the distance, being only thirteen mdes, is accomplished in less than an hour. III.

CONISTON, WINDERMERE, GRASMERE, DERWENTWATER, AND ULLSWATER. Although the production of iron is far from being equal to that of coal, it comes immediately after it in the enumeration of the mineral wealth of England. There is iron in abundance in all the northern and western counties, and in all the districts where coal is produced. It is only this union of the two minerals which gives iron an industrial value, for iron far distant from coal has only a relative value, since it is impossible under such conditions to produce it cheaply. In the supply of iron Scotland and Ireland have but a very small share : England and Wales furnishing more than nine-tenths of the whole. Yorkshire produces the most ; and then come in order of supply, Cumberland, Northampton, Lancashire, Lincolnshire, and Gloucestershire. The quantity of iron extracted from the mines amounted in 1868 to 4,970,206 tons; in 1882 it had almost doubled, and reached 8,493,387 tons, the value of which was perhaps \u00a321,000,000. But all the iron is not extracted from English ore; about one-eighth is derived from the mines of Italy, Portugal, and, above all, Spain. The last-named country furnished England in 1883 with 3,072,955 tons of iron ore, of the estimated value of \u00a32,800,000. The export of iron of all kinds, after declining for some years\u2014 from 1872 to 1876 \u2014increased, and in 1882 the total was 4,353,552 tons, ofthe value of \u00a331,598,306. Forty years ago England only exported, in all, 300,000 tons of iron ; it is evident how the supply has increased since then. There are at present in England and Wales 770 smelting furnaces, of which 550 are in full blast. The most important are those at Cleveland, in Yorkshire, of which Middlesbrough is the central point. It is to the iron-stone which abounds in the district that this town owes its existence. ar"], [80, "THE PROVINCES. 68 We often hear of the rapid development of cities in America; the same is true of England, and yet no one seems to notice the fact. Why ? Is it because it occurs under our eyes, and that distance magnifies facts, while it diminishes objects? Or is it rather because of the curious feeling Avhich impels us to appreciate only that which we see with the eyes of tourists through the mirage of the printed book ; and to admire foreign countries, of which the beauties are often better known to us than those of our own land? However this may be, Middlesbrough, which possessed only one house in 1820, now reckons more than fifty-five thousand inhabitants, and is extending every day. The banks of the Tees, formerly deserted, are now centres of feverish activity. To arid and waste plains have succeeded a flourishing town, manufactories, blast-furnaces, a harbour, and docks. It is worthy of remark that the veins of iron-stone discovered in 1831 by John Vaughan were known to the Romans, and it was by accident that they were re-discovered after centuries of oblivion. The blast furnaces of Eston, belonging to Messrs. Bolckow and Vaughan, are, they say, the largest in the world. More than 6,000 workmen are employed to convert the mineral into iron and steel . To the forges founded by them were added those of others ; and there are now in the environs of Middlesbrough a hundred furnaces, which from a distance one might take for the towers of some immense fortress, were it not for the clouds of smoke and the flames which escape from them. Rising to an altitude of 75 to 90 feet, these enormous brick cylinders are of such capacity that 500 tons of iron can be smelted in them every week. In 1880 there were produced from them 1,500,000 tons of pig-iron. All these establishments of recent growth are admirably planned and fitted ; the machinery is made on the most improved models, and according to those scientific principles which experience has proved to be the most correct. The forges are working night and day ; the electric light is regularly employed. A great activity, a continued animation, have succeeded to the desert solitude of the moors of Cleveland, the desolation of which had remained undisturbed for centuries. A mountainous district, which was formerly inhabited by the races called Brigantes by the Romans, Cleveland is a country of moorlands covered with high thick gorse. It is intersected here and there by long narrow valleys, surrounded by scarped hills, at the bottom of which run little water- courses. These valleys contain good grazing ground, and are sprinkled with boulders, whose grey masses contrast violently wish the verdure of the meadows. In all these districts are found traces of ancient British villages, particularly tumuli and artificial hills \u2014 a species of primitive fortification, some of which served as founda tions of the fortresses erected subsequently by the Saxons. In Yorkshire, too, at a little distance from Bradford, we find tbe blast-furnaces of Low Moor, the iron of which is celebrated for its superior quality, due more to the careful manner of its manufacture than to the inherent qualities of the mineral itself. This foundry, established in 1796, at a time when the means employed were still very imperfect, has advanced with the times, so it is unnecessary to endeavour to find proofs of its antiquity in the machinery and plant employed, for they are constantly being renewed. The only testimony to the lengthened existence of the Low Moor furnaces is"], [81, "THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICTS 69 the accumulation of scori\u00e6 and the mineral debris, which cover the country round about to such a depth that in many places it has become necessary to level the hills thus formed, and to recover them with earth in order to grow a few small trees. The best iron, however, does not come from Yorkshire; in Cumberland and Lancashire are found the mines of hematite, which are of such great value. In the latter county is Furness, the richest district in the United Kingdom in iron minerals. BLAST FURNACES AT MIDDLESBROUGH. the discovery of which has thickly peopled a region formerly almost deserted, and created an important industrial centre in the town of Barrow. Barrow-in-Furness is, like Middlesbrough, a striking example of the rapid growth of some English manufacturing towns. The little hamlet of Barrow, on the confines of Lancashire, in 1847, boasted only a population of 300 poor fisher-folk. In 1864 the population was 10,000; in 1867, 17,000; in 1878,45,000; and at present it exceeds 50,000 souls. To the extended workings of the iron mines of the district this tremendous increase in the population of Barrow is due, an establishment which only yields to that of Creusot in its extent. By a curious coincidence, one of the founders of the Barrow"], [82, "70 THE PROVINCES. forges was also named Schneider. Situated a mile from the town, this foundry includes sixteen blast-furnaces, 60 feet high and 20 feet in diameter, which produce annually 300,000 tons of pig-iron. In front of each furnace is a bed of sand divided into squares, where the molten metal, permitted to escape from the furnace through the opening at the base, cools into bars called \" pigs.\" The upper orifice of the smelt ing furnace is sur rounded by a gallery, whence the mineral is thrown in ; and inclined planes, laid with FURNESS ABBEY. rails, are used to convey the mineral, the coal, or the coke, to the furnaces.'

The Docks\u2014 constructed by the utilization of a little strait, which separates Barrow from Walney Island, and which the engineer closed at both ends\u2014 are amongst the curiosities of the district. In the middle of the strait is a small island, whereon stand the ruins of Peel Castle, built by an abbot of Furness, in the time of Edward III. The celebrated Abbey of Furness, situated two mdes from Barrow, is one of the most beautiful examples of the ecclesiastical architecture of the Middle Ages. It was erected in 1127, by the Benedictine Monks, who came from the Monastery of Savigny, in Normandy, at the invitation of Stephen, Count of Montague and Boulogne, afterwards King of England. The site chosen by the monks for their monastery was in a narrow valley, called the \" Valley of the Deadly Nightshade.\" The abbey, the ruins of whicli attest its pristine magnificence, covered an area of more than sixty acres, and in the reign of Edward I. the revenues were valued at \u00a320,000. The remains of this beautiful Gothic edifice give us an idea of its past splendour. The ruins of the church, of vast proportions\u2014 of the cloister, with its elegant arcades\u2014 of the refectory\u2014 of the chapter house and the belfry, whose mass even now overtops the other buildings \u2014 are all admirable examples of 12th century architecture. For a long time neglected, the ruins of the abbey are now well looked after by order of the Duke of Devonshire, the present owner. Furness is close to the celebrated Lake District, whose praises have been sung by a little band of poets, at whose head we find Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey. The \" Lake-ists \" \u2014 so called because they lived on the romantic shores of the lakes of Cumberland and Westmoreland, and also, and chiefly, because their poetry, inspired by the sublime grandeur of this region, celebrated, in all their aspects, its beauties and charms \u2014 were the founders of a school which has had an undoubted influence upou English poetry ; they were, above all, admirers of the simple and the true. The affectations, the stilted expressions of the classics were to them insupportable; in their view, the study of nature and the sentiments which influence humanity were the true objects of poetry. Devoid of imagination, cold, and wanting in spirit, the \" Lake-ists \" are well nigh forgotten nowadays ; and we may say, if they are remem bered, it is only because their names are associated with one of the most picturesque districts in Europe. The Lake District extends from Morecambe Bay, on the south, to Carlisle, in the north, and measures about thirty miles in length, by forty miles in width. It is contained within the counties of Westmoreland and Cumberland, and encroaches a little upon the northern part of Lancashire. The beautiful sheets of water it encloses, surrounded by mountains, valleys, thick and shady woods, have given rise to comparisons between it and Scotland, Wales, Italy, and Auvergne. All such comparisons are at the same time erroneous and correct, for the Lake District recalls, in various degrees, all these regions without absolutely resembling any one of them. Coniston Lake, the first which we see on leaving Furness to enter the Lake District proper, is one of the most charming. It is five miles in its extreme length, and its greatest width is about half a mile. Two pretty little islets rise in the centre of the lake, like two baskets of verdure. The west shore is bounded by a thick wood, while the opposite"], [85, "DERWENTWATER. 1. Tlie Lake. 2. Cascade of Lodore, 3. Friars' Crag. 4.

The tour of the lake in a steamboat, a steam gondola they call it in the district, and the ascent of \" Coniston Old Man,\" a mountain 2,700 feet high, which rises at the northern side ofthe lake, are amongst the excursions which must be made. From the summit of the \" Old Man \" the tourist may perceive all the mountain WINDERMERE LAKE. range of the Lake District, dominated by Skiddaw. At the base of the mountain the lakes of Coniston and Windermere extend in the direction of Morecambe Bay, which is visible in the distance. Separated from Coniston by a range of hills, the lake of Windermere is one of the largest and most beautiful of all. It is situated partly in Westmoreland and partly in Lancashire. It is eleven miles long and one and a half in average breadth. It is dotted with a number of small islands, upon which wild flowers abound in profusion, pointing with their bright tints the sombre hues of the verdure. Surrounded on all"], [87, "THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICTS. 75 sides by wooded hills and thick trees, Lake Windermere does not possess the wild grandeur of Ullswater; but the luxurious vegetation which it presents on aU sides gives it a nobleness and a richness of aspect far preferable to the coldness of the bare heights of the RYDAL WATER. other portions of the district.

Here and there a narrow valley opens up a long perspective, which is in its turn bounded by other hills of greater elevation. Alternating with the sombre rocks, are clumps of trees and thickets, which crown the heights, and undulate with the wind like feathers. At the foot of the hills is a narrow strip of land \u2014 meadow-land \u2014 which extends to thc edge of the lake, enclosing it in a frame of verdure, in harmony with the rich vegetation of the isles of Derwent and St. Herbert.

Near thc lake is thc Fall of Lodore, sung by Southey. A carriage road encircles thc lake, which presents it in a hundred different aspects. The most favourable points of observation are the Friars' Crag, a steep rock, near Keswick, and the height known as Castle Head. The valley of Borrowdale, at the southern extremity of the lake, is one of the most charming in the district ; it is watered by the Derwent, and covered with fat pasturage. There are few trees here. In this valley is thc huge boulder called the Bowder Stone, an immense mass of rock, detached by some convulsion from the adjacent hill. Not far from here are the mines of graphite (black lead) , which is used to make the famous Cumberland pencils. But \u2014 one more illusion ! \u2014 the pencils which are made at Keswick, which is thc centre of this industrv, are manufactured with the lead which (they say) is imported from Mexico.

In proportion as her population increases, England, the soil of which, although very fertile, is absolutely unable to support her inhabitants, devotes her energies to her industries and maritime commerce, to which she seeks to give, and succeeds in giving, a development which borders upon the extravagant. Great Britain, by her merchant marine, is the great carrier of the universe ; she tends to monopolise all the transport from the Colonies to Europe, and vice versd. By her industry she converts into manufactured products the raw material she imports in enormous quantities ; and it is by the profits which she thus makes that she is enabled"], [93, "THE HIVE. 81 to procure the food supplies which she draws, for the most part, from foreign sources. It is a question of life or death for her. She must have the finest merchant navy in the world. It is absolutely necessary that her manufactories should produce much, and at a cheap rate. Her existence depends upon it. See, therefore, what a commercial and industrial organization there is, what efforts are made, what energy is displayed by her ship-builders, her manufacturers, her merchants ! And what a hive is this country, wherein work is the general law, and where one sacrifices everything to business ! All around the coast there are nothing but harbours, dockyards, ship-building yards, and fisheries ; in the north, west, and midland counties, manufactories, workshops, and mines, occupy nearly all the population ; in the other counties agriculture demands the services of all workers. Of all the industries practised in England, there are two which, by the number of the manufactories and workmen, their development and importance, and their enormous expenditure, distance all others. These are the cotton and woollen trades, which are centralized, the former in Lancashire, the latter in Yorkshire. The county palatine of Lancaster, bounded on the north by Cumberland and Westmoreland, on the east by Yorkshire, and on the south by Cheshire, which is separated from it by the Mersey, falls gradually from the north, where are the chain of hills called the Lancashire Fells, and the Lake District, to the environs of Liverpool, where the country is flat and uninteresting. That part of the country which lies between the Ribble and an imaginary line drawn from Ormskirk to Manchester, is pitted with coal-mines, and is not essentially different from the coal district. We have already, in the preceding chapter, spoken at some length of the northern part of Lancashire, and particularly of the portion situated to the northwards of Morecambe Bay; it includes the Furness district and the Lakes of Coniston and Windermere. Primarily, Lancashire is an industrial and commercial centre, and one of the richest in England. Although, officially, the chief town of the county is Lancaster, it is unnecessary to state that Liverpool and Manchester are the true capital cities. Lancashire is the centre of the cotton trade. Manchester, or \" Cottonopolis,\" is the head-quarters of this great industry, which alone gives employment to more than half a million of \" hands.\" The first impression of Manchester is not prepossessing. An atmosphere laden with soot and smoke, lofty buildings, black and gloomy ; a damp and rainy climate \u2014 all this is not attractive. But as we do not go to \"Cottonopolis\" to contemplate the beauties of nature, and as, after all, the aspect of Manchester is the same as that of other manufacturing towns, we are quickly reconciled to it, and think of nothing but how to see it, and visit the numerous mills and factories which it contains. Built upon flat ground, at the confluence of the Irwell, the Irk, and the Medlock, three narrow rivers, whose black waters are so charged with filth that no fish can live in them, Manchester seems to have existed from the time of the Roman Invasion. But until the 17th century it was merely an insignificant little town of 6,000 inhabitants, with nothing about it to indicate its prosperous future. At this time the inhabitants were in the habit of buying, from the Irish, hemp, from which they made canvas, and imported from Smyrna cotton, of which they manufactured a species of fustian. They"], [94, "THE PROVINCES. 82 had learned this art from Protestant refugees, who, coming from Antwerp and Ghent, had settled in Manchester and Bolton. In 1760, the total value of the cotton industry of the United Kingdom was estimated at \u00a3200,000. The trade made little progress, because of the crudeness of the appliances; nevertheless, even then, the Manchester manufacturers exported fustian to Italy, Germany, and North America; the superiority of British cotton-stuffs being already acknowledged. Suddenly the inventions of Arkwright, Kay, Wyatt, and Hargreaves, caused a revolution in the cotton trade, by substituting machinery for manual labour. But, as is usual in all such cases, the inventors had to fight against prejudice and ignorance; happy when the work people, irritated and dreading the effect of the new inventions, did not smash their machines and burn their mills, as had happened to Arkwrighi. It took a long time to persuade the operatives that the employment of mechanical means, by lessening the cost of production would increase the demand, and consequently a greater number of hands would be employed. After a while, Crompton invented machinery far superior to either Arkwright's or Hargreaves', and Parliament voted him a sum of \u00a35,000. It is so very rarely that we see inventors rewarded by their contemporaries, that this instance cannot be too loudly proclaimed, and held up as an example to legislators in all countries. In proportion as the means of production were perfected, the population of Manchester and the surrounding districts increased. The town of Salford, situated on the right bank of the Irwell, was already but a portion of Manchester, though possessing its own municipal and political constitution, which it has always preserved. lu 1811 the population of the two towns amounted to 99,000 inhabitants; to-day it is 570,000, of whom 176,000 are in Salford, and 394,000 in Manchester. In the latter the population is very dense ; it amounts to twice as many inhabitants per acre as London reckons, and the mortality is somewhat higher. It is a curious fact that in all the city there is not a single square, garden, or space open to the public. There is need of fresh air. The streets, fairly regular, and intersecting each other at right angles, are narrow, with the exception of those which surround the Town Hall aud the Exchange. The middle class, according to the English custom, live in the suburbs, where they have built a great number of villas, which testify to the easy circumstances, and often to the wealth of the occupants. Communications are easily made, for Manchester possesses a system of railways, omnibuses, and tramways, which serve the smallest villages for many miles round. Salford, which occupies the whole of the right bank of the Irwell, is connected with Manchester by eight bridges. There are few ancient monuments and the modern ones are exclusively of the utilitarian order. Amongst the former the cathedral, situated ou the bank of the Irwell, in the old town, is the most important, although its architectural value is not great. This church, which dates from the 15th century, is of the style Perpendicular. It consists of a nave, side aisles, and a choir; it is, moreover, flanked by a single tower on its western facade. For such a rich city, the seat of a bishopric too, the cathedral of \" Cottonopolis,\" is something less than unpretending. The other churches, to the number of about one hundred, do not shine architecturally either. The civil monuments are far superior to the religious. Like Flemish cities,"], [95, "THE HIVE. 83 English provincial towns love to possess a fine hotel de ville \u2014 a town hall; that of Manchester, situated in Albert Square, was completed in 1877, under the direction of Mr. Waterhouse, the architect, who adopted the Gothic style, which he seems to be fond of. The Town Hall is a vast triangular building, of which the principal facade, looking to the square, is surrounded by a high tower, and embellished with smaller pinnacles. In the centre a wide doorway gives access to the interior, and a fine staircase leads us to the first floor, where is the great hall. It is painted in fresco, and embellished with busts of the members of the Royal family, as well as by a statue of MARKET STREET, MANCHESTER Mr. Gladstone. At the end is a magnificent organ, which came from the workshops of M. Cavaille-Coll, of Paris. Inside, as well as outside, marble and granite have been profusely employed, and the general effect is magnificent. The City expended \u00a31,000,000 in building and furnishing this edifice, the most beautiful of all its monuments. In the square, facing the Town Hall, is a memorial statue of Prince Albert, after whom the square is named. The Assize Court, situated in Great Ducie Street, is also the work of Mr. Waterhouse, and recals the architecture of the Town Hall. In this building an historical trial took place in 1867 \u2014 that of thc Fenians who attacked the prison van containing two Irish rebels, and released them after killing one of the escort. The authors of this audacious outrage, which was carried out in open day, were tried, condemned to death, and executed at Salford. Political trials are rare in England, and this event caused 39"], [96, "THE PROVINCES. 84 considerable excitement in Manchester, where the remembrance of it is still vivid. The Royal Exchange, at the end of Market Street, is a large square building in the Italian style, built about fifteen years ago. This is the third building which has been erected on this site. The two former were pulled down because they were not sufficiently large and commodious. More sensible than their brethren in London, the Manchester merchants have provided a covered hall where they can transact their business, sheltered from the storms of wind and rain, so frequent in their city. This hall, which is very beautiful, and luxuriously decorated, is remarkable for its fine proportions. On Tuesdays and Fridays, cotton-market days, from one o'clock till two, it is crowded with merchants, manufacturers in Manchester and the surrounding towns, buying and selling ; but all business is done quietly \u2014 there is no shouting. One hears only a loud murmuring peculiar to the commercial assemblies of Englishmen, who do not indulge in the shouting and yelling which amuse English people so much when they visit the Bourse in Paris. Beside the numbered pillars the merchants stand in groups. They always occupy the same places, and give as their address in the Exchange the number of their pillar, where it is always easy to find them or their representatives. They accost each other with a serious air, the offer or the demand is expressed in a few terse, clear words, which are formed by the lips, scarcely parted to utter them \u2014 English can be spoken without separating the teeth \u2014 the business is concluded or not j the speakers part, turn away, and make overtures for new negotiations. \" Good morning \" and \" good evening\" are not phrases in use \u2014 neither one nor the other. People do not go on 'Change to exchange civilities. That takes time and leads to nothing. Orientals, calm and impassible, converse with Greeks or lanky Yankees, whose appearance contrasts with the lusty and broad-shouldered Lancashire men. Everyone juggles with millions, for speculators are not wanting, and crashes are not unknown in the cotton trade. Generally, operations are conducted with great prudence, and business transacted rapidly is none the less well performed. Clearness of insight and decision are the prominent characteristics of the manufacturers. It is difficult to give exactly the amount to which business transactions reach annually in Manchester, but the Statistical Society of the city puts it at \u00a3318,000,000 sterling. If this be not an exaggeration, it stands to reason that it is prodigious ! The Branch Establishment of the Bank of England, in King Street, and the Manchester and Salford Bank in Mosley Street are well situated, particularly the latter, which occupies an elegant domicile, and one that may reckon amongst the local monuments. More remarkable still are the immense warehouses of Portland Street, Mosley Street, Oldham Street, and George Street, where are amassed mountains of cotton fabrics, plain, striped/ parti-coloured, flowered, figured; with Chinese, Japanese, Indian designs, according as they are destined for the European or Eastern markets, whence more than one traveller has returned, bringing specimens of these goods, under the impression that he has discovered something very rare. Very rare, trulv; for immediately these stuffs come from the manufactory they are packed in bales and dispatched at once. To obtain them then one must go to China, India, or Japan. Who"], [97, "THE HIVE. 85 will write The Mysteries of Trade ? What piquant revelations would see the light on the day when a man \" in the swim \" initiated the public into aU these secrets ! Will this man ever be found ? That is the question ! The arrangement of all the great warehouses is almost uniform. They generally occupy the whole of a five or six-storied house, of which the first floor is dedicated to the offices and the collections of patterns, kept in admirable order, and where any clerk can in a moment put his hand upon the specimen required. It is a marvel of arrangement ; the upper floors are filled with bales, the weight of which cause the iron girders which sustain the floor to bend. Lifts communicate with all the floors, from the basement upwards, and the packages are made up by means of special apparatus. The bales, placed under a hydraulic press, are reduced to the smallest possible dimensions ; wrapped in paper, in oilcloth, in cloth, and finally bound with iron. MANCHESTER CATHEDRAL. All these operations are performed with a rapidity and precision which are astonishing, the result of long practice, and appear very easy, so accustomed are the packers to the business. There are in Manchester many more warehouses than manufactories; the latter are in the environs and in the various industrial towns in the county. Nevertheless, in the Ancoats quarter, and particularly in Salford, there are cotton-mills, which may be visited with a letter of recommendation \u2014 an indispensable precaution, without which you will be \" left in the lurch.\" The rapid development of the cotton trade has given birth to another very flourishing industry \u2014 the making of machinery and appliances used in the cotton-mills, so true is it that in trade everything holds together, and when progress has been made in one direction \u2014 no matter which \u2014 it produces in others a corresponding advance. Engineering establishments are numerous : in them is made all the plant necessary for the mills, and also for railways. Among the best known of these are the \" Atlas \" works."], [98, "THE PROVINCES. 86 One of the characteristic traits of Manchester is the number and the importance of its schools ; as we know, the State holds itself aloof from the secondary and higher-class education, and to the enlightened minds and enterprise of the citizens is due the honour of having endowed the city with such flourishing institutions as none other can boast. The Government was not able to remain indifferent in the face of the laudable efforts of the inhabitants and the Municipality, and in 1880 a Royal Charter was conferred upon the University of Manchester under the name of the Victoria University, Owen's College being affiliated to it. This College, named after its founder, a rich Manchester merchant, was established in 1846. Mr. Owen bequeathed for this purpose a sum of \u00a380,000. In 1867 it became necessary to appeal to the generosity of the public to build a college sufficiently large for the increasing numbers of the students, and Mr. Waterhouse was com missioned to erect the Gothic building in the Oxford Road, of which the inhabitants of Manchester are so proud. This self- gratulation is quite comprehensible, for Owen's College is to-day enriched by half a million of money subscribed by private individuals. It reckons about 2,000 students and pupils, of whom a full moiety attend the evening classes only. The Chetham Hospital, intended for the reception and instruction of forty poor children, can now receive a hundred, in consequence of the increased value of the property left for the purpose by its founder, Humphrey Chetham, in 1651. An English proverb states that \" All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,\" and recreations are not wanting in Manchester. Four theatres provide entertainments which would do credit to the London boards. There are, besides, a great number of music halls, and various miscellaneous shows. The concerts given in the Free Trade Hall \u2014 a magnificent building capable of seating 5,000 persons comfortably, are celebrated throughout England. To breathe purer air than that of their streets the inhabitants are compelled to go a long distance ; the three parks which are the \" lungs \" of Manchester \u2014 to employ the received English term \u2014 are at a considerable distance from the city. The \" Queen's Park\" is at Harpurhey, on the Rochdale Road. More to the east, going down hill, we find \" Philips Park,\" which is traversed by the Medlock; and on the south, at Hulme, is the \" Alexandra Park,\" which was opened in 1870. But the most beautiful of all is \" Peel Park,\" at Salford, on the right bank of the Irwell. It is forty acres in extent, and is most picturesquely laid out. It must be confessed that the inhabitants of Manchester are somewhat rough in their manners, but, withal, a good-natured roughness ; this is the outcome of the strain on the mind, the consequence of their one aim in life \u2014 business. The old saying, \" Manchester men and Liverpool gentlemen \" \u2014 which seems to imply that in Manchester there are only men, while in Liverpool there are gentlemen \u2014 is unjust ; there are both in each town. It would be difficult to see in what respects, from the point of view of education and enlightenment, Liverpool is superior to Manchester. The latter city has given birth to persons eminent in letters and science, as well as industrial art. Thomas de Quincey, the \" opium-eater,\" the remarkable essayist ; Mrs. Gaskell, the novelist ; Sir W. Fairbairn, the engineer, were all born in Manchester. Doctor Dalton, although"], [99, "THE HIVE. 87 born in Cumberland, may be said to belong to Manchester. He is the distinguished chemist who discovered the malady known as \" Daltonism \"-colour-blindness Dalton was himself afflicted by this disagreeable malady, and it is related of him that one dav he purchased a pair of brilliant red stockings, which he believed were of a dark hue People were all the more astonished to see him arrayed in them, as he belonged to the Society of Friends, who only affect dark and sober garments. His researches in chemistry have rendered the greatest services to the cotton industry, wherein the use of colouring matters for fabrics has given birth to the manufacture of chemical products, of whicli quantities are employed : witness the numerous laboratories in the environs of the city, and to which the Irwell and the Medlock owe the ex traordinary colours of their streams. Politics have always played a considerable part in Manchester affairs. The first Sir Robert Peel, had a manufactory there, aud at the time of the Reform agitation the Liberals took an active part in the struggle, which was crowned with success after thirteen years. Later on, when Cobden, who represented the city in Parliament, undertook his campaign for Free Trade, he was sustained chiefly by Manchester. ASSIZE COURT, MANCHESTER. Notwithstanding its importance, this great city\u2014 the fourth in the United Kingdom \u2014 was not represented in Parliament until 1832, when the Reform Bill bestowed upon it the right to return two members to Westminster, a privilege it had not enjoyed since 1654, in the time of Cromwell. It was to the Member for Manchester that the Protector gave the order to \"take away that bauble,\" as he designated the mace, the symbol of Royal authority placed in front of the Speaker during the sittings of Parliament. At present Manchester is represented by six members, and Salford by three. In politics the electors of Manchester are Liberal; their city is the bulwark of Free Trade, and of the so-called \" Manchester School,\" whose motto is \" Peace at any Price.\" Politicians of this stamp depreciate all interference by England iu European affairs, and even in those which, although nearly concerning their country, would tend to war, or even to the appearance of war. Mr. Bright, it will be remembered, quitted the Ministry of which he was a member when the Egyptian Expedition was decided on in 1882. The views of Cobden in the House are represented by Mr. Bright and Mr. Chamberlain (lately in the Cabinet). Business first \u2014 this is, in short, the political creed of the Manchester school, a school which is as good as any other, and which, by the number of its adherents in Parliament, some of whom have reached Ministerial rank, appears"], [100, "88 THE PROVINCES. likely to take a very prominent part in the direction of the affairs of the nation. Manchester, then, is as important from a political as from a commercial point of view ; although Conservatives are not without influence in Lancashire, the Liberal party is much more numerous and influential. These diverse opinions have in the press organs of recognized power and merit. The most important of the twenty Manchester newspapers is the Guardian, whose London and foreign letters are well written, and often attract notice: a circumstance which has gained for it a correspondingly influential position in the provincial press. In the matter of communications, Manchester is the centre of a system of canals and railways which fulfil all requirements. From all time the question of transport has been the constant consideration of manufacturers. In the 18th century it took a day to travel in the coach the thirty-one miles between Liverpool and Manchester, and the cotton was carried on packhorses in caravans. In bad weather the state of the roads threatened to put a stop to the manufactories in Liverpool. It was then, in 1767, that the \" Grand Trunk Canal \" was cut between Liverpool and Manchester. But this means of transport was too costly, and it became necessary to think of others. In 18.25, Stephenson \u2014 after unheard-of difficulties and determined opposition \u2014 succeeded in obtaining authority to construct a line of railway between Liverpool and Manchester. The opening of this line took place on the 15th of September, 1830, and an unfortunate accident, which caused the death of Mr. Huskisson, the member for Liverpool, threw a gloom over the ceremonial. The locomotive, the \"Rocket\" \u2014 a perfect toy compared with the engines to which we are accustomed \u2014 is preserved in the South Kensington Museum of Patents. For fifty years radways have been multiplying around Manchester to such an extent that there is scarcely a village which is not served by one of these numerous lines, which intersect the county in all directions, and converge to one or other of the four great termini in Manchester. The system is so perfect, so complete, that the cotton is conveyed from Liverpool to the mills without trans-shipment, and the fabrics which are not intended for the Manchester warehouses are forwarded direct to the docks on the Mersey, or over the various lines of the kingdom. FinaUy, a circular railway connects aU the lines which run to Manchester. Notwithstanding all these facdities, certain discontented spirits, finding the accom modation insufficient, proposed to cut a canal suitable for large vessels, to bring from Liverpool to Manchester the ships which at present anchor in that port. This project was thrown out by Parliament without discussion in 1883, but Lancashire people are obstinate, and have returned to the charge. Given the facilities of locomotion, nothing is easier than to visit the manufacturing towns of the district \u2014 Stockport, Warrington, Wigan, Rochdale, Blackburn, Bolton, Ashton-under-Lyne, and Oldham, where we find the \"mills,\" as they are called, a name which is applied to all the workshops and factories in which machines are employed, spinning miUs and weaving mills alike. These mills, according to official census, number 2,674 ; and of the 2,579 in England and Wales, 2,000 are in Lancashire ; the others in Yorkshire, where there are about 200 ; while Cheshire,"], [101, "THE HIVE. 89 Derbyshire, and Scotland possess 89; and Ireland 6 \u2014 an insignificant proportion. The numbers of persons employed are, according to the official statistics, 482,903, of whom 185,472 are men, and 297,431 women and young girls. In the mills there are, altogether, 514,911 looms, and 44,000,000 of spindles. In 1832 there were only 9,000,000 in the whole kingdom, so the number of spindles have quintupled in less than fifty years. The production has octupled in the same time. The export, which reached the value of \u00a319,200,000 in 1830, had risen in 1882 to \u00a376,600,000. This latter figure is not the highest on record, for in 1872 the export value exceeded \u00a380,000,000. Of all the cotton- ROYAL EXCHANGE, MANCHESTER. manufacturing towns, Oldham is the most important not only in the county, but in the United Kingdom, so far as fabrication is ccncerned. Oldham contains 113,000"], [102, "THE PROVINCES. 90 inhabitants, and owes its development to its industry. There are in the town more than 250 cotton-mills, which counts as many spindles as there were in all the kingdom in 1832, namely, 9,000,000, and 14,000 looms. From the moment when the raw cotton reaches the manufactory to the time when it passes out, in the shape of thread, from the spinning mills, or material from the weaving mills, it goes through a successive series of stages of preparation, of which the foUowing are the principal. First, the cleansing (\"teazing\"), which is performed by wooden machines called \" willows,\" revolving cylinders garnished with iron points or studs. From the willow it passes to the carding machine, which lays all the fibres parallel to each other. It is next sent to the drawing frame, and the \" roving \" frame, which twists it and rolls it. The cotton is then made of different thicknesses, which are indicated by the numbers. These numbers show the fineness of the thread expressed by the number of hanks necessary to reach a pound's weight ; so cotton No. 40 is cotton of forty hanks of 840 yards in the pound. Before the invention of the \" mule,\" that was the finest cotton made ; but now they produce cotton of 460, that is to say, a pound of thread, which measures 386,400 yards in length. The tissues are wrought in the weaving mill, but there are establishments in which they spin and weave ; so that the cotton which reaches them in fibre goes out in the shape of calico, cotton velvet, or other cotton goods. In these factories, instead of the old looms, they use \" power \" looms, worked by steam, which throw the shuttles, arrange the warp and the woof, draw away thc material as it is made, and roll it upon the wooden cylinder, where it forms a \" piece.\" Women attend to the power looms, and their duty consists in adjusting the parts of the machinery here and there. When the material is made up it must be bleached. That is the business of the bleaching works, where the pieces of cotton are collected, that is to say, sewn together, one after the other, until they form a gigantic ribbon of many hundred yards in length, which is passed over cylinders heated sufficiently to burn off any threads which may be too long. Afterwards the washing takes place, which necessitates fifteen different operations ; then the drying, and finally the packing. The cottons to be printed, or covered with various designs, are handed over to the print works. This department has also been brought into a state of perfection Machines, printing in five or six colours, cover with parti-coloured patterns a piece of 200 yards in a minute. For curtains, certain machines print nearly twenty different colours at once. This cotton-printing has been brought to yield wonderful results from the decorative point of view, as regards shades and designs, and also exceedingly cheaply \u2014 an important consideration in a country in which competition is so keen and where nearly all merchandise is admitted free of duty. Besides Oldham, within a radius of ten miles from Manchester, we find the towns of Bolton, Ashton-under-Lyne, Middleton, Bury, Stockport, and Rochdale, where are Mr. John Bright's cotton mills. Further north are Blackburn, an important manufac turing centre, picturesquely situated in the midst of wooded hills ; and Preston, on the Ribble, which keeps 30,000 workmen employed, who sometimes go out on strike. The celebrated strike of 1853 lasted eight months. At Preston, Arkwright, the celebrated inventor of the spinning machine, was bom"], [103, "THE HIVE. 91 He died rich and titled, having been knighted by George III. Preston also gave birth to a celebrity of another kind \u2014 Lady Hamilton, the \" friend \" of the illustrious Nelson.

It is said to contain 1,784 millions of tons of this coal. There are still bright days in store for the gas companies. Between Wigan and Liverpool stands St. Helen's, which is the centre of a particular industry \u2014 glass-blowing. There half of all the glass made in England is produced. St. Helen's also possesses soda manufactories, copper foundries, and coal mines, and turns over every year nearly \u00a3400,000 in business transactions. Not far off is Widnes, a borough containing 20,000 souls, which was not in iu"], [104, "THE PROVINCES. 92 existence in 1840. This is now the chief centre of the soda manufacture, a very important business in England, whence are annually exported about 380,000 tons, of the value of \u00a32,080,000. This trade alone uses 750,000 tons of coal annually, and 250,000 tons of salt. Widnes possesses also a great number of soap manufactories of considerable importance. Lastly, Lancashire is fairly rich in lead, and particularly in copper mines ; but the latter are not much worked, this business having declined some years ago. II. YORKSHIRE : THE RIDINGS.

Adjacent to Lancashire, from which it is separated by a range of hills, having the Tees for its northern boundary, the Humber on the south, and on the east the German Ocean, Yorkshire is the largest county in England. Its superficial area is 5,961 square miles, and its population 3,000,000. It is divided into three parts, called Ridings, named, respectively, the East, North, and West Riding. The word \" Riding \" is a corruption of \" Trithing,\" which signifies a third part. The three Ridings are united at York, the chief town of the county, which occupies almost the mathematical centre. Of very ancient origin, York has preserved its type of antiquity to a considerable extent, particularly in the narrow streets called \" shambles,\" in which the visitor may see old houses with pointed roofs and overhanging storeys; the shops being occupied by old-clothes sellers, bric-a-brac merchants, and dealers in old iron. Like Chester, York is surrounded by walls, from which the view of the cathedra] is very fine. The enceinte is cut in various places by the Ouse and the Foss, and in other places we find it absorbed in private property. The old gates of the city, called \"bars,\" which date from the time of Edward III., are reckoned amongst the local curiosities, and are in good preservation. We may mention, in particular, Micklegate Bar, the most beautiful of all; Walmgate Bar, the only one which is protected by a barbican ; Bootham Bar and Monk Bar. York, as well as Canterbury, has the honour of being the seat of an archbishop. The Archbishop of York is the Primate of England ; the Archbishop of Canterbury is the Primate of all England ! A very subtle distinction this, and one which for a long while divided the clergy. At the coronation of one of the Kings of England, the Archbishop of York, having arrived before his brother of Canterbury, seated himself on the Episcopal throne ; and the Archbishop of Canterbury, finding he could assert his superiority in no other way, seated himself upon his rival's knees !"], [105, "THE HIVE. 93 York is also the only city in England, besides London, whose mayor receives the title of \" Lord.\" The glory of York is its magnificent cathedral \u2014 perhaps the most beautiful in England. It is certainly the religious edifice which presents the most imposing and majestic aspect, by its immense proportions, the height of its three towers, and, above all, by its nave. The last-named is 100 feet in height and 264 feet long, and is lighted MICKLEGATE BAR, YORK. by lofty pointed windows, filled with superb old stained glass, and by a lantern fixed in the central tower. The choir, separated from the nave by a stone screen, carved with a delicacy and taste impossible to describe, is closed by a splendid window, which is literally a marvel. The central tower, which uprises in the centre of the nave, at the intersection of the transepts, rests on four immense arches, supported by enormous pillars. At the end of the northern transept are five lovely windows, called the \" Five Sisters,\" filled with ancient stained glass of the greatest beauty. Indeed, aU the windows in York Minster are very remarkable, and almost all are ancient. As for the exterior, the western facade, flanked by two towers, displays a central"], [106, "THE PROVINCES. 94 door, embellished with sculptures. Above it is a beautiful mullioned and moulded window, of rare elegance and richness. The towers, which are 201 feet h.gh, are pinnacled and embattled. The central tower, also embattled, was intended to support a steeple, but it has never been added. To enjoy a good view of York Minster, there are no better places than the ramparts, which also form an agreeable promenade. York also .possesses twenty-four churches, some of which are very interesting; but after the cathedral, the objects most worthy of notice are the Castle, of which the only ancient and really remarkable portion is Clifford's Tower, formerly the donjon of the fortress; and the Museum of the Philosophical Society of Yorkshire, situated in a beautiful garden, which encloses some very interesting ruins. Here we find the Multangular Tower, of which the lower portion dates from the Roman occupation, and the ruins of St. Mary's Abbey. As regards communications, York has become an important centre since the era of railways, as the phrase is : it is the junc tion for the trunk lines from the midlands to those proceeding north and south. Three quarters of an hour railway journey from York on WALMGATE BAR, YORI the Scarborough line brings us to the beautiful mansion of Castle Howard, belonging to the Earl of Carlisle, and of which the structural arrangement resembles Blenheim. Both these mansions were built by Vanburgh, too. Castle Howard is a magnificent seat in the midst of a beautiful and extensive park, containing ornamental water and long avenues of trees a hundred years old. There is also to be seen an obelisk, a temple, and a mausoleum in which are interred the Earls of Carlisle ; it was of this funereal monument that Horace Walpole wrote, saying that the spectator would be tempted to be buried alive there. Furnished with princely magnificence, Castle Howard contains a splendid gallery of pictures of the Italian School, the gem of which is the celebrated \" Adora tion of the Magi,\" by Mabuse ; and an interesting collection of Grecian and Roman antiquities. After York, the most important towns in the county are the great manufacturing centres of the West Riding. 3 The North Riding includes the Cleveland District, and the eastern portion of the county. The East Riding presents us with excessively pretty coast scenery, extending from the Tees to the Humber. In this part of Yorkshire the Wolds, a group of calcareous hills, are situate. As in all the northern counties of England, iron and coal are found in abundance in Yorkshire. From the manufacturing point of view it is the centre of the woollen trade, as Lancashire is ofthe cotton trade. Although the woollen manufacture forms the staple industry of the county, it is far from being the only one. The cutlery works of Sheffield, the ironworks of Cleveland, which have been mentioned, are present to remind us that"], [107, "THE HIVE. 95 the natural productions of Yorkshire are as important as its manufactures. The latter are collected for the most part in the south-eastern district of the county, and conse quently in proximity to the great industrial centres of Lancashire, so that the two trades of cotton and wool \u2014 the most important in England \u2014 are circumscribed within a rela tively small space, which we may call the Hive, and which, taking Manchester as the central point, extends in a circle of about fifty miles round. Leeds, Bradford, Halifax, and Huddersfield, are the principal centres of the worsted and woollen trades ; Sheffield that of steel, machinery, and cutlery ; Middlesbrough of iron works. We have already mentioned the rapid growth of the last-named town. It YORK MINSTER. rests with us now to speak of the others, to describe them, and to give some details con cerning their various industries which have bestowed upon them such great wealth and importance. The woollen trade has more than one point of connection with the cotton trade ; like the latter, it dates from the most remote period, for even at the time of the Roman conquest England was exporting wool; and it is also to the Flemish refugees in England in the 14th century that the development of the woollen manufacture is due. Lastly, to render the analogy complete, the introduction of machinery, and, later, steam engines, revolutionized this industry as well as the cotton trade. Up to the 17th century the woollen trade was carried on in a very primitive"], [108, "THE PROVINCES. 96 manner ; there were no large manufactories : the manufacturers distributed the wool to the peasants in their districts to convert it into worsted, and in this new form they returned it. The worsted was then distributed amongst the weavers. During the 18th century this system prevailed almost universally, but since the commencement of the 19th century the establishment of great factories, and the system of working in large numbers, have completely superseded individual labour. The wool, before it becomes cloth is sub mitted to twenty-six opera tions, half of which are effected by machinery. We can easily estimate the importance of the woollen trade by the number of necessary articles which it furnishes \u2014 stockings, knitted goods, various stuffs for clothes, alpacas, cloths, and the innumerable variety of tissues known as \"shoddy,\" of which common clothing is made and sold very cheaply. According to the official returns of 1879, there are in England 2,562 woollen manufactories, containing 6,200,000 spindles, and 146,000 power looms, which employ 278,000 workpeople. More than half these manufactories are in Yorkshire, the others are scattered chiefly in Wales and in Monmouthshire. THE SHAMBLES, YORK. It is principally from Australia that the English derive their wool supplies. Formerly Spain and Portugal furnished the raw material; till the last century the Germans were in active competition with these two countries, and ended by superseding them. At the same time England herself produced a great deal of wool, so that she only imported a small supply from other European countries. In 1840 she imported 50 600 000 lbs weight; in 1862, 136,000,000 lbs. Now the wool is almost exclusively derived from Australia. At the same time, and by a natural consequence, the home-raising of"], [109, "THE HIVE. 97 sheep diminished as the importation increased. The number of sheep was, in 1867, 34,000,000; in 1868, it was only 30,700,000; and in 1882, 24,000,000. The farmers' merely deliver the animals to the butcher without taking into consideration the wool, which is of less value than the mutton. In 1882 the importation of wool amounted to nearly 534,000,000 lbs., repre senting a value of \u00a324,745,000. Of this quantity Australia alone furnished about 380,000,000 lbs., valued at \u00a318,000,000. Peru and Chili sent alpaca and lama wools to the amount of 2,400,000 lbs. Nine-tenths of the wool imported is consigned to THE GUILDHALL, YORK. London, which is the great market for the raw material, as Liverpool is for cotton. It goes without saying that this enormous quantity of wool is not all made up in this country. A considerable portion of it is transmitted to foreign countries\u2014 chiefly France, which purchases from England annuaUy about 135,000,000 lbs. of raw Australian wool, to the value of \u00a38,000,000. A propos, is it not curious that the French manufacturers stdl buy in London the material which could be so easdy sent direct to Havre, to their advantage and to that of the shippers ? For, after all, there is no reason why they should pay to British merchants and shipowners the cost of trans port and the commission, which increases the price of the material, and makes the fortunes of foreign shippers, to the detriment of our own. Ah ! routine is a beautiful thing ! The value of the exports of wool in yarn, or manufactured, was, in 1882,"], [110, "THE PROVINCES. 98 \u00a322,167,279, which, added to the value of the raw material exported, namely, \u00a315,248,138, gives for wool and woollen stuffs a total of nearly \u00a337,500,000; so the woollen trade is more extensive, and more valuable than the iron trade by about \u00a35,000,000. Finally, Yorkshire is also the principal seat of the English linen ',iAteicr.zr manufacture ; but it is in Ireland and, above all, in Scotland that this trade is chiefly carried on. In fact, of the 400 linen factories in the United Kingdom, only 100 are in England and Wales. CASTLE HOWARD. III. LEEDS: ITS GENERAL ASPECT; ITS MONUMENTS AND FACTORIES. \u2014 RIPON CATHEDRAL. STUDLEY ROYAL, AND FOUNTAINS ABBEY. Leeds, the commercial capital of Yorkshire, is situated on the River Aire, which divides it into two parts; the old town was originally the portion which is on the left bank; but of late years it has crossed the bridges and absorbed the neighbouring villages. This is the usual course with all English towns, and it is reproduced with monotonous regularity."], [111, "THE HIVE. 99 In 1642, Leeds, like Manchester, Bradford, and many other towns, was taken by the Duke of Newcastle, and retaken afterwards by the Parliamentary troops under Fairfax. In the 18th century it was already a great cloth market, as Defoe tell us in TOWN HALL, LEEDS. his \" Tour in Great Britain.\" Then the market was held on the bridge over the Aire. Towards the end of the 18th century the prosperity of Leeds continued to increase from year to year ; then the progress made in the development of machinery gave it a new and more vigorous impulse still. The population increased in an astonish ing proportion. In 1801 it was 55,162, 172,000 in 1851, 253,000 in 1871, and 321,000 in 1882. Workshops and factories rose on all sides. There are now 900 in Leeds and 41"], [112, "THE PROVINCES. 100 its neighbourhood, where in 1793 was only one\u2014 that of Messrs. Wormald, Fountayne, and Gott, the first of the kind; for untd then the spinning and weaving of the wool was done by the peasantry. Then, as the woollen industry developed, dyeing works, bleaching works, chemical works, engineering estab lishments, foundries, and, in fact, all the accessory businesses which are indispensable to a great manu facturing town, were established. Leeds is only this, and nothing else. We need not attempt to seek either beauty or picturesqueness there. There are no monuments whatever. Factories, warehouses WHITE CLOTH HALL, LEEDS. dominated by their high chimneys pouring out steam and smoke more or less black, more or less thick, which overshadow, like an unwholesome imitation of black and grey clouds, the sky which ought to be visible \u2014 if the sky ever is visible in Leeds \u2014 that is the picture ! With the exception of Sheffield, there is no place less attractive or blacker. The streets, lined with high buildings, containing offices or shops with curtainless windows, have, notwithstanding their animation \u2014 especially on market days RIPON CATHEDRAL. \u2014 a dull and gloomy appearance. The principal thoroughfare is Wellington Street, in which we find the business houses of the best known and most opulent merchants. The churches have nothing remarkable about them ; they are all modern, with the"], [113, "THE HIVE. 101 exception of St. John's Church, which dates from the 17th century.' Situated in th< old town, simple even to nakedness, this edifice is scarcely worth a visit, despite th< amount of fine wood-carving which it contains. The Town Hall, situated in Park Lane, near the railway station, is a vast buildin\u00b0- in the Italian style. We particularly remark the great hall called Victoria Hall, which is used for festivals and concerts, of which the inhabitants of Leeds are very fond, as testified by a magnificent VIEW OF FOUNTAINS ABBEY organ which occupies one end of the hall. This taste for music is one of the most striking characteristics of the people in the north of England. We find it everywhere \u2014 in Liverpool, Manchester, Bradford, Birmingham, and Leeds, and generally in all other trade centres. The Philosophical Hall, in Bond Street, contains a public library, a well-stocked zoological museum, and some geological and mineral collections. There is also an industrial museum here, wherein are collected specimens of various local industries and their primary adjuncts. This is one of the curiosities of the town. The Mixed Cloth Hall and the White Cloth Hall were formerly markets where"], [114, "102 THE PROVINCES. the merchants had their stalls, where they bought and sold. But now transactions between them and the retailers are performed direct; besides, the greater number of the merchants are also wholesale dealers. So an intermediary has been suppressed, to the advantage of the consumer. When we have visited the Royal Exchange, the Hospital, and the Grammar School, we have seen all the edifices of Leeds. Then we may go and inspect the real monuments of the town \u2014 the factories. These are found more or less sprinkled in all parts of Leeds, but particularly in the west end, in the direction of the Kirkstall Road, which is parallel with the river. They are immense buildings, whicli by day look like barracks, CLOISTERS, FOUNTAINS ABBEY. and at night like immense lanterns. At certain establishments the wool arrives in bales, is teased, washed, combed, spun, and finally made into cloth ; other houses only operate upon the yarn ; and others, again, only on the weft. Amongst the first-named factories, that of Messrs. Gott specially is worth a visit ; but here, as everywhere, it is absolutely necessary to be provided with a permit, without which no one is admitted into any factory or workshop. The foundries of Airedale and Wellington, the factories of Armley, and the glass works of Hunslet, are very curious establishments ; but perhaps the most remarkable of aU is the flax-spinning mill of Mr. Marshall, on the banks of the Aire. This immense establishment, in which more than a thousand workmen are constantly employed, is composed of two factories; one built on the ordinary plan, the other\u2014 much the more interesting\u2014 being only of one storey, and covering about two and a half acres of ground. Let the reader picture to himself a large flat building, about twenty feet"], [115, "THE HIVE. 103 high, the roof of which, covered with mould and sown with grass, is in various places topped by immense flattened domes, looking like Brobdignagian mole-hills. WTe enter this strange edifice by a door constructed after the model of the propylon of a temple of Isis or Osiris; not far from which a species of obelisk serves as chimney. An obelisk RUINS OF FOUNTAINS ABBEY vomiting clouds of coal smoke ! What an anachronism ! Let us proceed, however. As soon as we have entered, we find ourselves in a hall 360 feet long and 195 feet wide, which extends the whole length of the building. The roof is supported by fifty cast iron pillars, and is pierced by circular openings. Wre now perceive the use of the gigantic mole-hills aforementioned : they serve as ventilators. The grass upon the roof secures an equable temperature, which is indispensable in linen manufacture. All the operations are simultaneously carried on in the various portions of this building. Here the mechanical spinning-jennies are"], [116, "THE PROVINCES. 104 buzzing; there the Jacquard machines, which are still the most perfect of their kind, are making a deafening noise while performing the most delicate operations, executing the most complex designs, with a facility and regularity of which we can give no adequate idea. What a marvellous genius was his who designed this masterpiece of mechanical science ! All these machines are driven by two steam-engines of 350-horse power each, which are in a separate building. It is calculated that there are made 60,000,000 of yards of thread daily, besides an immense quantity of various stuffs\u2014 table linen, bed-ticking, and other materials. Quitting the hot and dusty atmosphere of these establishments, one is only anxious for fresh air. In Leeds this is difficult to procure ; but, about three miles distant, is the Roundhay Park, purchased, in 1872, by the Municipality for a public garden. This park, which cost \u00a3140,000, is 750 acres in extent, and is unquestionably one of the finest in England. The numerous houses which surround it are the dwellings of rich merchants and manufacturers who, like those of other trading centres, live in the country, both as a matter of taste and for health's sake. Like Manchester, Leeds was not represented in Parliament until 1833. Its first two members were John Marshall, the celebrated manufacturer, and Macaulay, the illustrious essayist, and the author of a \" History of England.\" Three immense railway termini, all situated in the neighbourhood of Wellington Street and the Cloth Hall, put Leeds in direct communication with all parts of England; and we cannot do better than to select this town as head- quarters, when we propose to visit the great industrial centres of this district ; for Bradford, Halifax, and Huddersfield are not far from each other, and are served by frequent trains, which accomplish the journey in a very short time. So far as intercommunications are concerned, the English provinces have no need to envy the metropolis. Before going south again, towards the trade centres, we must say something concerning Ripon Cathedral and the ruins of the celebrated Fountains Abbey, which is situated less than twenty-five miles from Leeds. Ripon is a small town, the only interest in which centres in the cathedral, a monument of small dimensions, but remarkable as an example of the Early English style in all its purity. The west front is particularly interesting ; it consists of a central building, gabled, 103 feet high, and flanked by two towers somewhat higher. The nave is very lofty and very wide, and of later date, although the style is antique and in harmony with the facade. A screen of the Perpendicular class separates the nave from the choir, which displays three different styles. The chapter-house, the sacristy, and the cell of Saint Wilfrid, are, after the facade and the nave, the most noteworthy portions of Ripon Cathedral. Three mUes from Ripon stands the magnificent mansion of Studley Royal, the seat of the Marquis of Ripon, who is also the owner of the ruins of Fountains Abbey, so named because of the springs which exist in the environs. Founded in the 12th century by the Benedictine monks, on the plan of Clairvaux and Citeaux, the Monastery of Fountains soon became one of the largest and richest in England. The walls of the abbey enclosed numerous buildings, which covered a superficies of eighty acres ; these were a church, the monastery proper, the abbot's house, a hospice for the reception of"], [117, "THE HIVE. 105 wayfarers, an infirmary, a court-house, without reckoning the outbuildings, such as a mill, stables, in which were kept the abbot's six white horses, which drew his carriage ; the kitchens and other domestic offices. Splendidly situated on the banks of the River Skell, in a secluded valley, Fountains Abbey, seen from a distance between the wooded banks of the stream, appears to be uninjured ; and it is not till one approaches it more nearly that the sad state of dilapidation into which it has fallen is evident. The church, with its high tower, first strikes us by the vast proportions of its nave, transepts, and choir. There are few more imposing sights than these ruins : the nave, with its wide windows, whose mullions are broken; the transepts, with frail and elegant columns, and their capitals delicately carved. WThat thing can be seen more really beautiful, in its sublime simplicity, than the cloister, 270 feet in length-, with its central row of pillars, massive at the bases, but which rise and branch out into interlacing arms, which sustain the vaulted roof while embellishing it ? We can well appreciate the feelings of emotion which, at the sight, prompted M. de Montalembert to fall upon his knees in an ecstasy of admiration. Above the cloisters was the dormitory, of which nothing remains save the two staircases which led up to it. The other portions of the ruins, such as the refectory, and particularly the chapter-house, which is richly ornamented, testify equally with the church and the cloisters to the greatness of this celebrated abbey, the most remarkable monument of the kind that England ever possessed. IV. BRADFORD: THE WORKING POPULATION. THE MONUMENTS. \u2014 THE LEGEND OF THE WILD BOAR. THE FACTORIES. \u2014 SALTAIRE AND ITS FOUNDER. S. LISTER AND MANNINGHAM MILLS. Bradford shares with Leeds the supremacy of thc woollen trade, each town having its speciality : that of Bradford consists in yarns and. stuffs, called \" worsted goods \"\u2014 that is to say, goods made with the long wool ; whde Leeds has a speciality for the manufacture of the short wool, or \" woollen goods.\" The town, although very ancient, has a very modern appearance, for the old quarters have been recently rebuilt. The streets are wide, fringed with high and solidly built houses, possessing a certain claim to architectural beauty, but of a gloomy aspects in consequence of the greyish brown of the stone used in their construction. There is considerable animation evident chiefly about mid-day, when the factory-gates are opened to permit the egress of the swarms of work-people to their dinners. The men are in no way distinguished by their dress from those of other towns ; the elder women wear the handkerchief tied under the chin, as usual ; but the younger generation seem to prefer the horrible straw hat and feathers, flowers, and ribbons, which British industry"], [118, "THE PROVINCES. 106 produces in such quantities, and at such a low price. The crowd, in spreading through the streets, fills them with a curious sound\u2014 that of the clogs which Yorkshire people wear, and which resemble somewhat the foot-coverings of the Boulogne fisher-folk. While perambulating the streets, one feels that one is in a rich town, pompously built by people who do not regard expense, and an intelligent municipality, which is not stingy. The public buildings are vast, richly decorated, if not in the best taste ; they have a substantial look, in harmony with the private houses, which do not lack a certain character. The Town Hall is, as a matter of course, the most beautiful monument in Bradford. It is situated in New Market Street, in the centre of the town, and was opened in 1873. BRADFORD. The facade, in the Gothic style, is imposing, with its three storeys pierced by pointed windows, and the high square tower, or campanile, which rises above the entrance. In imitation of the Houses of Parliament in London, it is embellished with escutcheons and statues, representing the Sovereigns of England, in the midst of which we perceive Oliver Cromwell \u2014 a position one would scarcely expect to have met him in. Besides the apartments appropriated to the Mayor, and the council chambers, the Town Hall contains the borough court, the decorations of which are very rich. Amidst the subjects of decoration we notice the head of a wild boar, which repeats itself with a persistence that leads the visitor to seek an explanation of it. Here it is. At the time when beasts could talk, Bradford was surrounded by thick forests, which were inhabited by wild animals. A wild boar, of unparalleled ferocity, made tremendous ravages in the country ; and such was the terror he inspired that even the boldest hunters did not dare to encounter the monster which every day did more damage, as his audacity and his malice seemed to increase. After a while no one dared to go"], [119, "THE HIVE. 107 outside the limits of the town. The offer of reward scarcely tempted the Nimrods of the district, when one young man, more courageous than his fellows, and whose name history unfortunately has not preserved, resolved to rid Bradford of this terrible animal. He armed himself and set out in quest of this formidable wild boar, which he slew after an heroic contest, no doubt, but concerning which we have no details, the modesty of the hero having prevented him from recounting the stirring particulars, as it had already induced him to conceal his name. However, not forgetting that he had to receive a reward, the young man cut out the tongue of the wild boar, which he carried back as a trophy and as proof of his prowess. Arrived in the presence of the magistrates, to claim the recompense to which he was entitled, the youth found himself confronted by a rival in the person of an inhabitant known for his cowardice and supine ness, who, carrying the head of the animal, the dead body of which he had found, was demanding the promised reward. The assembly were about to adjudge it to him, when the anonymous hero pre sented himself before thc embarrassed conclave. \" Ask this felon,\" he cried, \" where the tongue of the animal is ? And if he pro duce it, let the reward be his.\" The boar's head was examined, and the tongue CHURCH AT BRADFORD. was found wanting. Then the youthful hunter victoriously exhibited it, to the confu sion of his rival, who retired, amidst the jeers of the assembly, while the young man received the congratulations of the magistrates and the reward he had so well merited. And that is the reason why the boar's head figures in the arms of the town of Bradford. In front of the Town Hall will be perceived the statue of Sir Titus Salt, the celebrated manufacturer, who died some years ago. The smoke has overlaid the figure with a thick coating of soot. Another statue \u2014 that of Sir Robert Peel, in Peel Place \u2014 is still blacker. It is a mere question of time. Opposite is the Mechanics' Institute, which was opened in 1870. This is a budding in the Italian style, containing a library and a lecture hall, where a number of artisans assemble to follow the courses of science lectures, delivered by distinguished professors. Close by is St. George's Hall, which serves for assemblies and concerts, or for public dinners \u2014 a frequent form of entertainment. The Royal Exchange, in Market Street, near the railway station, resembles the 42"], [120, "THE PROVINCES. 108 Town Had, but is not so fine.

Thetwohrst- named, situated to the north of the town, otter an excel lent view of Bradford. Seeing Bradford to-day so prosperous, so wealthy, with its great warehouses and immense factories \u2014 seeing this town, where all the resources of science have been taken advantage of, in order to bestow upon the inhabitants the largest pos sible measure of prosperity, where progress is manifest at every step \u2014 one would scarcely credit the difficulties against which such men as Horsfall, Murgatroyd, and the Fosters have had to con tend and to surmount, to compel the brutal and ignorant population to adopt the improvements which would lead them to pros perity. Moreover, this struggle deserves to be re corded, for it is instructive MARKET STREET, BRADFORI in the highest degree. We find in it the perseverance, the indomitable energy, which are so characteristic of English merchants and manufacturers. In 1798 Bradford had only one factory, aud to build even that it became necessary to overcome the ill-will of the inhabitants, who contended that the smoke from one chimney would suffocate them, and of the workmen, who refused to permit the passage of the carts carrying the stone for the building of the establishment of Messrs. Ramsbotham, Swaine, and Murgatroyd. The last-named gentleman, gifted with con summate coolness and a Herculean frame, went direct to his point. He put himself at the head of the carts, and led the horses, in the midst of a hooting crowd, towards the"], [121, "THE HIVE. 109 site whereon he intended to build his factory. The crowd, hostile and furious, pressed upon him from all sides and hindered his advance. In the calmest manner possible, Mr. Murgatroyd took off his coat, turned up his sleeves, and alone, face to face with the enraged multitude, threw himself upon the greatest brawler whom he found within reach, and administered to him one of those thrashings which is an event in a man's life. This violent, but persua sive argument had a magical effect \u25a0upon the crowd, which sullenly retired, butwith- Hmit daring to H\"|'| oe the man Buii: knew so well H how to use his MONUMENT TO SIR TITUS SALT. SALTAIRE INSTITUTE. fists. After that Mr. Murgatroyd was able to transport his materials unopposed. Better still, five years afterwards, in 1803, the very same people who had signed the petition against the use of steam\u2014 .amongst others, Mr. Rand, one of the great manu facturers of Bradford\u2014 hastened to adopt it in their establishments too."], [122, "THE PROVINCES. 110 Later stdl, in 1826, when it became a question of substituting steam machinery for hand labour, new disorders, marked this time with violence, arose. The factory of Messrs. Horsfall was literally besieged by 500 discontented workmen, who were on the point of taking the place by assault when the police, headed by the Mayor, arrived. The Mayor made the usual appeal, but was answered by a pistol shot. Then the defenders of the building lost patience, and replied wish a volley which killed two persons and wounded a number of others. The law prevailed, and this was the last little riot which stained with blood the streets of Bradford. Since that time the number of factories and workshops have been steadily increasing : in 1833, there were thirty-four in Bradford, now there are 300, and the trade in woollens alone exceeds \u00a370,000,000 per annum. The population, which numbered 13,000 inhabitants in 1801, was 106,000 in 1861 ; 180,000 in 1881 ; and 205,000 in 1883. During this period the old town disappeared, new houses rose up in all directions, and Bradford assumed the gloomy, but wealthy, aspect it wears at present. The wool factories are situated in Bradford and its suburbs ; it is absolutely necessary to be furnished with an introduction to inspect them. They .are, with the great warehouses, the sole attractions of the place. Although these factories may all be equally well worth seeing, there are two which we cannot by any possibility omit to visit\u2014 these are Saltaire and the Manningham Mills. Saltaire \u2014 so called from its founder, Sir Titus Salt \u2014 is not only a factory, it is a town \u2014 a veritable town \u2014 with churches, schools, dwelling-houses, park, and gardens surrounding an immense factory, which is surmounted by a square tower and a colossal chimney. Where Saltaire now stands grass was growing thirty years ago. The story of the creation of this town, evolved from nothing by the energy and will of one man, is one of the most curious chapters of the history of modern enterprise. Read it, it will repay the trouble. Titus Salt was born in the early years of the present century in Wakefield, a small town in Yorkshire. He was still an infant when his father, who was a manufacturer in a small way, came to establish himself in Bradford. The youthful Titus had a bias for agriculture, and no taste whatever for spinning yarn and weaving cloth. But man proposes ; it was decreed that he would never be a farmer. Willingly or unwiUingly, he was obliged to enter his father's business, where he passed a some- what rough apprenticeship, and at the end of a few years he set up on his own account in Silsbridge Lane. Thither was brought to him one day a particular kind of wool, long and tangled, and so stubborn, that no one would have anything to do with it. Nothing- daunted, Salt succeeded, after many efforts, in weaving this wool, which had come from Russia; then, satisfied at having conquered the difficulty, forgot all about it. Three years afterwards he found in the establishment of a consignee in Liverpool a number of bales of wool, similar to the Russian kind, which no one would take. He examined it, learned that it had come from Peru, carried home a sample of it, and decided to do his best with it. The task was not an easy one. This wool was long and glossy, and could not be carded by ordinary means, so it became necessary to make a special apparatus. l'or a man of such perseverance this was only a detail. Salt made his machines and reached the goal he desired. He succeeded in producing a light, silky material as lustrous as silk, such as they make certain garments of in South America, it is true \u2022"], [123, "THE HIVE. 111 but which no one in Europe had ever made. Titus Salt had invented \"Alpaca.\" His first care was to collect all the capital he could dispose of and to borrow a sum of money large enough to purchase the 300 famous bales in Liverpool which had found no pur chaser. Then he made alpaca of it. To make a new material is good, to get rid of it SALTAIRE CHURCH AND PARK. is better, but more difficult, as Salt soon perceived. Merchants had but little faith in the alpaca, and after Salt had contended against material obstacles, he found he had to combat prejudices. But he had the faith which moves mountains. Four years afterwards Titus Salt was in a fair way to make his fortune ; he found his factory too"], [124, "THE PROVINCES. 112 small ; he built another, then a third ; and these in their turn being found insufficient, he conceived and carried out the idea of founding Saltaire. About three miles to the northward of Bradford the tourist comes upon a pretty town picturesquely situated ou the banks of a clear stream, the white houses being sur rounded by gardens, and all grouped around a monumental factory : this is Saltaire. This little town, unique of its kind, contains twenty-two streets, and 800 houses, in which reside some 5,000 workpeople and their families. The streets, wide and regular. are remarkably well looked after. In the centre of the town are public baths and wash houses, which are admirably fitted up and managed. Several churches, schools, a gymnasium, a hospital, a club, a library, and a music hall, are amongst the number of the buildings which Sir Titus Salt has erected in his town. Fifty small houses are appropriated to the aged poor who can no longer work; the proprietor grants them pensions of from eight to twelve shillings a week. Lastly, there is a pretty park of fifteen acres, part of which is reserved for cricket, lawn-tennis, and bowls, the remainder, arranged as a garden, serves as a promenade and recreation ground for the inhabitants. They are remarkable for their good appearance, exemplary conduct, and really superior education. Their grade of morality is very high : you will find neither drunkards, criminals, nor idlers in Saltaire ; but a hard-working population, intelligent and honest, very different from that one is accustomed to meet with in industrial centres. The factory, whicli occupies a space of 12i acres, is 495 feet long, by 45 feet wide, and is composed of a vast building of six stories about 66 feet high. It is a model of construction and arrangement. Iron and stone, artistically blended, give it solidity as well as prettiness, while it is secured, as far as possible, from risks of fire. In the interior lifts connect all storeys, or the various work-rooms, which, kept scrupulously clean and neat, are filled with a large number of workpeople. Both men and women have a robust and healthy appearance, and an air of contentment, which strikes the spectator immediately. Treated with great strictness, but with equal justice, considered as associates, not as mere beasts of burthen, they preserve their self-respect, and profess a great regard for their employer, who has made such noble efforts to ameliorate their position. A deafening noise is produced by the machines, the click-clack of the looms, the buzzing of the shuttles, as they pass backwards and forwards, and the murmur of many voices. Thanks to the system of ventilation adopted, there is very little of that nauseous and unwholesome dust whicli is the cause of so much disease amonjrst cloth weavers. The history of Saltaire and its founder has more than one claim to be narrated here : firstly, because Sir Titus Salt, citizen of Bradford and Mayor of that town, was a local celebrity; and also because this great trader was also an enlightened philanthropist, who has left us a noble example\u2014 an honest man in the fullest sense of the word. Sir Titus Salt was created a baronet in 1869, and in 1874 the town of Bradford raised a statue to him, which stands in front of the Town Hall. He died in 1876, full of honours, and carried with him to the grave the esteem of all his fellow citizens. Manningham Mills is an immense establishment in the Heaton Road, near Lister Park, founded by Mr. S. Lister, for the manufacture of velvet and silk\u2014 quite novel industries in Bradford. Mr. Lister, the son of a wealthy manufacturer of that town,"], [125, "THE HIVE. 113 had been destined by his parents for the Church ; but he did not take to the profession, and went into business. Being rich, and at the head of one of the most prosperous worsted factories, he had only to exist ; nevertheless, this did not suffice for his energy and indefatigable activity. Of an inventive mind, he set himself one day to utilize a certain silk called chassum, of which up to that time no one had made any use. He designed certain machines, caused them to be made, built a factory, and expended \u00a3240,000 before he realized one shilling. But since that what a return he has had ! Manningham Mills is the proof; this magnificent building, which cost \u00a3480,000, is MANNINGHAM PARK. one of the most important establishments in Bradford. The two blocks of buildings, six storeys high, cover a space of twelve acres, and are surrounded by a wall, which is jealously guarded by a Cerberus who permits no one to pass the portal who is not furnished with a special order of permission. Once inside, it is astonishing to see the machines at work. What animation \u2014 what movement ! And to think that this colossal factory is only one of the many enterprises of Mr. Lister, who is at the same time a silk, velvet, and woollen manufacturer and a tea-grower besides. Yes, a planter of Assam tea in British India ! This is how it happened ; for it was quite by accident that Mr. Lister became a competitor of the Chinese. He had purchased about a thousand acres of land in Assam, for the purpose of rearing silkworms to provide the material for his velvet looms. After a while the price of silk fell so low that Mr. Lister found it more advantageous to purchase the raw material in Europe than to import it direct. He quickly made up his mind; he uprooted his mulberry trees and planted tea, so he became a tea grower as"], [126, "THE PROVINCES. 114 well as a manufacturer. In his leisure moments he invents some new machine or improves the old ones, and rears cattle. There is something of the American about this man, who is endowed with tremendous activity, with such a practical mind, and so much decision. In fact, while a young man, Mr. Lister passed many years in the United States, and there he gained that confidence in himself, that boldness, which the Yankees possess in a remarkable degree. Like Sir Titus Salt, Mr. Lister has had the satisfaction of seeing his efforts appreciated by his fellow citizens, who, while he is still alive, have erected a statue to his honour, in one of the open spaces of Bradford. Such men as Salt and Lister are the glory of a nation\u2014 the equals of the greatest warriors. Their peaceful victories conduce to the national prosperity, and it is not without reason that Englishmen have named them the \" Great Captains \" of Industry. From Bradford to Sheffield, by Halifax and Huddersfield, two manufacturing towns of considerable importance, is no great distance : and if the tourist do not stop at either of those two towns the journey can be accomplished in about three hours. The route presents no interest : the country, somewhat hilly, is dotted here and there by factory chimneys, the view of which by this time is getting monotonous. A little distance from Bradford is the village of Thornton, celebrated as the birthplace of Charlotte Bronte, the novelist, better known as Currer Bell. After Bradford, Halifax, and even Huddersfield, contain nothing which merits the attention of the tourist, who is in a hurry to reach Sheffield, which is situated on the confines of Derbyshire, one of the most picturesque counties of England. V. SHEFFIELD. \u2014 ITS ASPECT. \u2014 ITS MONUMENTS. THE CUTLERY TRADE. \u2014 THE WORKSHOPS. \u2014 FORGERS AND GRINDERS. AMERICAN COMPETITION AND THE TRADES* UNIONS. \u2014 THE VALLEY OF THE DOVE. \u2014 THE POTTERIES. Sheffield rejoices in the well-merited reputation of being the blackest and most smoky town in the three kingdoms. It is more than a century since Horace Walpole wrote \" It is one of the dirtiest towns in a beautiful situation.\" What would he say of it now that the factories have increased a hundredfold, and the sky is continuously obscured by the veil of smoke mingled with fog which hangs over the town like a pall ? The suburbs, it is true, are charming ; and it is perhaps the contrast which makes still more painful the impression that the appearance of Sheffield gives us. The streets, both narrow and tortuous, are lined with wretched, low, brick houses, reeking with depravity and vice more than with misery, and forming a labyrinth through which it is difficult to find one's way. We miss the solid buildings of Bradford or Manchester, and their wide and well-kept streets. The working population, wretched and puny, form a separate race of beings, who, below middle height, have an unhealthy appearance. The working-men of Sheffield"], [127, "THE HIVE. 115 have attained an unfortunate notoriety by their violence at critical periods ; and their moral level is decidedly low. Sheffield numbers 295,000 inhabitants, that is to say, the population has increased six-fold in eighty years. To its industry we must attribute this rapid increase, and as the same fact is reproduced everywhere one is stupefied at the prodigious development of the English nation, its vitality, its energy, its immense resources, and of the profit it CHESTERFIELD. knows how to make out of the riches of the soil Wonderfully situated in the centre of a coal- field, the town of Sheffield possessed all that was requisite to become what it is\u2014 a manufacturing centre of the first rank. There are no monuments except, perhaps, the old Parish Church of St. Peter, which dates from the fifteenth century. The exterior has been so often repaired and restored that but little of the original remains. The interior is interesting, chiefly on account of the tombs in the Shrewsbury chapel. We there perceive that of Lord Shrewsbury, the sixth of the name, who was appointed gaoler cf Mary Stuart during her captivity in Sheffield, and who assisted at the execution of that unhappy queen. His recumbent effigy is gilded, at his feet is crouched a hound\u2014 a talbot. We know that the patronymic of the family is Shrewsbury and Talbot, so the hound figures in their armorial bearings. Not far from here is Cutlers' Hall, a heavy and gloomy building, with pilasters and columns. The interior is scarcely more attractive than the exterior. There are 43"], [128, "THE PROVINCES. 116 only a few portraits of local celebrities, of no artistic value, and some equally feeble busts. The Cutlers' Corporation, established in the reign of James I., formerly exer cised domination over all the makers of cutlery ; but since 1832 its functions have been restricted, and it is now only a corporation like that of the City of London. Every year the president of the Society, who is called the Master Cutler, gives a dinner to which the notables of the county are invited; a festival very much resembling, in proportion, the Lord Mayor's banquet. It is, moreover, the only duty which the Master Cutler is called upon to perform. At the corner of Bow Street and Leopold Street is an immense building in the Italian style. This is Firth College, so called from its founder, Mr. Firth, who died some years ago. This institution, intended to serve as a technical school, has already rendered, and is destined to be of, the greatest service to the population of Sheffield. The Corn Exchange, built by the Duke of Norfolk, and the Central Market are, with the buildings we have mentioned, all that Sheffield possesses in the way of monuments. The re mainder are not worthy of mention. The names of the streets \u2014 Howard Street, Norfolk Street, Talbot Street, Shrewsbury Street \u2014 suffice to remind us that the Earls of Shrewsbury were formerly the lords of CUTLERS' HALL, SHEFFIELD. Sheffield, where they owned vast properties, which, in consequence of the marriage of one of the daughters of the seventh earl with one of the members of the Howard family, passed into the possession of the Earls of Arundel, who afterwards were created Dukes of Norfolk. Thus it happens that the present Duke of Norfolk is the owner of the greater part of Sheffield, whence he derives considerable revenues, estimated at various amounts, but which cannot be less than \u00a340,000 a year. The Manor House belongs to the Duke ; it served as a prison for Mary Stuart during her long captivity. That part of the Manor House was restored a dozen years ago by the orders of the Duke, who has done a great deal for Sheffield, and bestowed upon it the beautiful park which bears his name."], [129, "THE HIVE, 117 Steel working, in all its forms, is the speciality of the town. At Sheffield, work infinitesimally personal stamp, tries, while the the workmen are divided, bestows upon local productions a character, a which is wanting in the greater number of modern indus special arrangements of the factories and the manners of I there from those of other manufactur- ing towns. At Sheffield, machinery has not been able to supplant hand- labour. The men work in their own houses, by the piece. Each has his speciality. One makes table knives; another, pen-knives ; this man, scissors, that man, razors. And, again, the workman who forges the blades will not grind them, and he who grinds them will not fix the handles to them. The handles of metal, wood, ivory, bone, or horn, are equally the objects of various and quite distinct handicrafts. The steel which is used for making the celebrated Sheffield cutlery is almost all produced from foreign iron imported from Russia, Germany, and particularly from Sweden. All the cutting instruments are of forged steel, \u2022 the preparation of which formerly occupied three weeks ; but it is now completed in a few hours by the process invented by Sir Henry Bessemer, and called by his name. Let us enter a cutler's workshop: what do we see? None of those ingenious machines of which Leeds and Manchester are so proud, but forges with anvils of peculiar form, and troughs full of water, which are used to temper the forged steel. A forger seizes with his pincers one of the red hot pieces of steel, and with a dexterity which it is impossible to conceive, he gives it, with a few blows of a hammer, the form of a knife-blade. When he has forged the requisite number he blows up his fire, takes the blades one by one, heats them red hot, and plunges them into the trough of water ; then, taking them out again, he heats them a second time to make them less brittle, and to MANOR HOUSE, SHEFFIELD, give them the necessary elasticity. On the skill of the workman, as much as upon the"], [130, "THE PROVINCES. 118 quality of the metal, the value of the blade depends, and the cutlers of Sheffield are incomparably skilful. From the forger we pass to the grinder. A grinding mill is one of the greatest curiosities of Sheffield. In a large workroom one can see pass under the grindstone all sorts of cutting instruments, from the smad penknife to the immense scythe ; the most delicate of surgical instruments to the stone-cutting saws. The stones, dug from Wickersley quarries, are of various sizes : some nearly three feet in diameter, others only MATLOCK. eighteen inches in circumference. All these revolve simultaneously, and produce as they reduce the steel a whistling noise most disagreeable in intensity. Here a workman is fondly grinding a formidable surgical instrument, or one of those famous hollow ground razors. There a grinder stoops holding the great blade of a scythe, upon which he is pressing with all his weight of hands and knees, only the tips of his toes resting on the ground. This is a very dangerous method of grinding scythe-blades; one false movement, a momentary dizziness, would cause him to lose his balance, when the immense grindstone would catch him up and hurl him against the wall. This is not the only danger which threatens the grinder. Notwithstanding all precautions, the stones sometimes burst, hurling pieces in all directions, causing terrible destruction and spreading death in the workshop."], [131, "THE HIVE. 119 HIGH TOR AND CHEE TOR. Farther on, there are others grinding steel forks upon dry stones. These men are martyrs to the terrible trade of the grinder ; the dampness of the workshops, and, above all, the particles of iron and stone which they inhale, give them lung diseases, and serious affections of the respiratory organs. It has been proved that out of 2,500 grinders, there are only forty who reach fifty years of age ; and that amongst eighty fork-grinders \u2014 who, of course, work at the dry stone \u2014 there is not one of thirty-five years of age. It was a good idea to compel grinders to wear a magnetized collar to attract the particles of iron, and, better still, a gauze mask ; and an apparatus has been in vented which protects the workmen from this danger, but they rarely avail them selves of it, for the men themselves are the first to neglect all precautions. After the grinder comes the polisher, who employs a wooden grinding disc, which is covered with leather, or metal"], [132, "THE PROVINCES 120 of a particular alloy, and gives to the steel that polish which is so much admired on new blades. The making of files\u2014 the celebrated English files\u2014 employs a large number of workmen at Sheffield, whose sureness of hand and quickness of eye are extraordinary. All this minute work is done by hand : that is to say, the cuttings-parallel in the small files, cross-ways iu the larger ones\u2014 what are called the teeth, are all cut by the work man. Armed with a well-tempered chisel and a heavy mallet, he makes at every blow a fresh cut, and such is the correctness of his eye that the grooves are exactly parallel, of the same depth, and equi-distant one from the other. Their precision is marvellous, and the Sheffield work men are very proud of their superiority. This pride is one of the marked traits in their character; they enter tain a sovereign con tempt for the workmen of all other countries, whose rivalry they do not fear. Nevertheless, the scythes, the hatchets and the planes made in America are superior to the Sheffield tools. While the manufac turers in the 'United States have employed themselves in improv ing the tools they make, the masters in Sheffield have been obliged to MILLER'S DALE. give up the struggle in consequence of the obstinacy of their workmen, who, doing piece-work, and under the dictation of the Trades' Unions, have refused all improve ments, and demanded such an increase of wages that the struggle against foreign competition becomes impossible. The Trades Unions \u2014 associations of working men established with the view to defend and maintain the rights of the \" working man,\" and to obtain an increase in the rates of wages \u2014 have rendered great service to the labouring classes in liberating them from the yoke whicli certain masters would lay upon them ; but they have also done a great deal of harm. They have branches in all industrial centres, and every year they hold a Congress whereat delegates from the various sections discuss questions affecting artizans, and even political and social topics. Their circle enlarges year by year, and the progress of these associations, their increasing, and often unreasonable, demands have caused the formation of an Employers' Defence League, intended to"], [133, "THE HIVE 121 maintain their rights, as the workmen defend their own. In general, it must be con fessed that the mutual relations between employers and employed in the period of strikes are harmonious enough, and the greater number of these disputes are arranged upon a basis of mutual accommodation. But it bas not been ever thus, and people have not forgotten the outrages committed about eighteen years ago in Sheffield by the members of the Cutlers' Trades' Union, directed by the execrable Broadhead, who for many months supported a reign of terror in the town. His associates kept the secret so well that helpless Justice was obliged to have recourse to corruption. What a deplorable system that must be HADDON HALL. whicn encourages treachery and even crime, as we have recently seen some individuals planning crimes they had no intention of committing, but only in order to receive the reward given by the police to those who will bring them information ! There have been spectators of the comic spectacle of four malefactors who had entered into conspiracy, and each of whom had confided to the police the secret of the association ; so on a certain day each of the four accomplices were arrested at the same time on the information of one of the others. What an excellent plot for a farce ! After the cutlery, the fabrication of steel plates for armoured ships and rails for railroads are the most important business of Sheffield. In this way is employed the"], [134, "122 THE PROVINCES. celebrated foundry of Sir John Brown, which is now a limited liability company like that of Messrs. Cammed & Co. When we have seen all we wanted to see, it is with a deep sigh of satisfaction that we bid adieu to this agglomeration of blackened houses, factories, workshops, and chimneys, without air, light, or sun, which is called Sheffield. The Midland Railway, which puts Sheffield in communication with Birmingham, vid Derby, traverses the county of that name\u2014 one of the most picturesque and hilly shires of England. This pretty district, watered by limpid streams, intersected by ravines which divide beautiful hills crowned with graceful trees, is at the same time agricultural and in dustrial. Rich in minerals, it boasts a hundred blast furnaces, w'hich produce about 300,000 tons of iron, and its collieries, which number one hundred and forty, yield annually\" five millions of tons of coal. Leaving Sheffield, the railroad goes towards Chesterfield, a small and pleasant town, which can be seen very well from the rail way carriage. Stephenson, the father of railways, is buried in one ofthe churches of Chesterfield. BUXTON GARDENS, Having passed Clay Cross, whose coal mines are celebrated, the train arrives at Derby. This town is pleasantly situated on the banks of the Derwent, yet there is nothing to attract or detain the tourist. But it is very different with the environs and the pretty valley of the Derwent, which the railway follows on its way to Matlock and Buxton. Matlock is a much-frequented watering-place, which owes its celebrity to its beautiful situation in the charming valley which is dominated by High Tor, a high chalky mass emerging from a forest of verdure, opposite to which is another height named Masson. The springs of Matlock, discovered in 1698, have the property of petrifying objects placed in them. The inhabitants do a good business in objects thus solidified \u2014 flowers, plants, birds'-nests, &c. The environs of Matlock are exceedingly pretty, and abound in interesting sites and"], [135, "THE HIVE. 123 pleasant walks, particularly on the banks of the Derwent. The caves of High Tor and Masson reckoned among the local curiosities do not sustain their reputation \u2022 but the ascent of these two hills-arid and little frequented-wdl repay the touris't by the beautiful panorama they disclose. Midway between Matlock and Buxton there is a seat belonging to the Duke of Devonshire, which is very interesting as a specimen of fifteenth century architecture. Haddon Hall isamassive building with angular towers, and battle mented walls, situated on a rising ground, at the base of which flows the Wye. Although in singularly good preservation, this lordly re sidence is no longer inhabited. The decorations and the old furni ture in the rooms possess a great artistic value. A beautiful garden and a park of considerable extent surround Haddon Hall, which may be considered one of the most remarkable mansions in Derby shire. From Haddon Hall to Buxton the road passes through the beau- tiful valley of Miller's Dale. Grey peaked calcareous rocks bound the valley, at the bottom of which the Wye glides between banks covered with thick herbage and dark green thickets. Here and there a boulder overhangs the river, or per haps, plunged in the stream, divides its waters, which surge against the obstacle. Emerging from Mdler's Dale, which closes in and forms a narrow gorge, we come in view of the enormous rocky mass of Chee VIEW IN ASHWOOD VALLEY.

Buxton is situated upon a plateau sheltered by high hills, and almost at the source ofthe Wye. Its mineral springs, known to the Romans, and enjoying a high reputation in England, attract a number of visitors every year ; but like ad watering - places, Buxton, when the season is over, is the abode of much dulness. The environs are even more agreeable than the place itself, and the visitor can make innumerable excur sions in the neighbourhood within reasonable distances and without great fatigue. We 44"], [136, "THE PROVINCES. 124 may particularly indicate the Valley of the Dove, which is at least as picturesque as Miller's Dale. . , There is no place between Derby and Burton-on-Trent that deserves special LION ROCK, VALLEY OF THE DOVE. mention ; but the latter town, so well known by its celebrated breweries, is interesting to see. Here are the establishments of Bass, Allsopp, and Ind Coope, not to name more, all millionaires, vying in riches. The red triangle, which is the trade mark of the pale ale of the first-named firm, is as familiar to the Parisian lounger as to the citizen of London, so we will not com ment much upon this brewery in which 2,000 workmen are occupied in concocting the liquor dear to Gambrinus and to the English. We will merely state that the brewery occupies an area of 60 acres, where are stored 500,000 barrels of beer, while the lines of rails within the VIEW IN THE VALLEY OF THE DOVE. establishment, if placed together, would reach a little more than five miles, The celebrated Potteries' District is about thirty miles from Burton, with which placed is connected by a branch line of rail. It includes the towns of Burslem, Hanley,"], [137, "THE HIVE. 125 Stoke-upon-Trent, and Longton, and the villages of Etruria and Fenton. It is crushed into a small space ten miles long and a mile and a half wide, and, as may be taken for granted, the population is very dense, the four towns containing in the aggregate 100,000 inhabitants. There are more than 250 works in which porcelain, faience, &c, \u25a0are manuiacturea, without reckoning the affiliated estab- lishments, foun- dries, coal mines, and colour makers.

This is usually the best course to pursue when you have visited some factories and the celebrated establishments of Minton and Copeland, where strangers are always received with the greatest courtesy."], [138, "THE PROVINCES 126 VI. BIRMINGHAM. ITS MONUMENTS AND ITS INDUSTRIES. STEEL PENS. ARMS. \u2014 GLASS- WORKS. JEWELLERY. \u2014 ART INDUSTRIES AND FRENCH ARTISTS. Situated in the north-west angle of Warwickshire, on the boundaries of Stafford shire and Worcestershire, with which its suburbs are contiguous, Birmingham is the centre of the district known as the Black Country, because of the numerous coal mines, foundries, factories, and the uniform blackness of its soil, covered with scori\u00e6 and coal dust, and overhung by a thick cloud of smoke. Surrounded by iron and coal mines, which furnish the raw material and the motive power, admirably served by a system of canals and railways, which, while putting it in communication with all parts of England, facilitate the export of its products, such a town could not help becoming an industrial centre of the first importance. In the seventeenth century the sword manufactures of Birmingham were already celebrated, and one manufacturer alone furnished 15,000 sabres to the Parliamentary troops fighting against the Royalists. The Radicalism of Birmingham, we perceive, is not an affair of yesterday. Under William III. a new industry, that of fire-arms, was established there. Later, assisted by fashion, steel buckles and buttons were made there ; scabbards, and the multitude of metal ornaments with which our fathers loved to adorn themselves. These objects, called steel toys, were exported in considerable quantities to Holland, Germany, France and Italy, and this traffic caused Edmund Burke to say that Birmingham was the toy-shop of Europe. At the end of the last century the introduction of the steam-engine gave a new impulse to local industries, and thence forth the career of this town is identified with the history of metal industries in England. The population and the manufactories increased in equal proportion. In 180 J there were 70,000 inhabitants; in 1831, twice as many; in 1875, 350,000; and in 1883, 415,000. If we include the inhabitants of King's Norton, Aston, and Edgbaston we can, without exaggeration, estimate the total population at half a million. The town is not attractive in appearance. Apart from the great thoroughfares, such as New Street, the streets are narrow, bordered by small, low houses, which have a melancholy and poor appearance. It is the true provincial town, shabby and charac terless. Beside these stunted houses rise fine solid buildings \u2014 the factories and warehouses, which form the most interesting part of Birmingham. Several years ago, the well-to-do merchants, the members of the liberal professions, and, in a word, all those who form what is called the upper middle class, emigrated to Edgbaston, to the south-west of the town, where they built pretty villas, half hidden in shrubs, some of which are of remarkable elegance. Thus Edgbaston, which was formerly separated from the town, is now united with it, so persistently have they built in that neighbourhood. The monuments of Birmingham are few and very commonplace. Two parish"], [139, "THE HIVE. 127 churches, St. Martin's and St. Philip's, represent rehgious architecture. The former, dating from the thirteenth century, has been almost entirely rebuilt. St. Philip's Church, situated on rising ground, was built in 1719 by a pupil of Sir C. Wren, who was evidently inspired by the masterpiece of his master. From the top of this church, which is built on the highest ground in Birmingham, a fine view of the city and its suburbs is obtainable.

The interior consists almost entirely of a beautiful hall, 135 feet in length and 57 in width and height. On three sides are galleries, the fourth side is arranged for an orchestra, behind which there is a very fine organ. In the vicinity of the Town Hall are found the few statues which embellish the streets of Birmingham. In a small square we notice a statue in bronze, representing Sir Robert Peel, the work of Mr. Hollins, a local sculptor, and not far from that are statues of James Watt, the inventor of the steam engine, of Prince Albert, and of Sir Rowland Hill, to whom the Penny Post is due.

Lastly, by reason of its various industries, this town, unique of its kind, is one of the most curious and most interesting in the country. Ah ! who can enumerate these industries of Birmingham ? They make everything there, and a thousand things besides ! Machines and toys, buttons and swords, pianos and clocks and watches, carriages and glass, screws and jewellery, ribbons and nails, and chiefly the plated articles with which England floods the universe; and the steel pens, so useful and so convenient, which seem to have existed in all time, and whose introduc- tion is actually so recent. Whence come the so-called Egyptian antiquities which the fellaheen sell to the simple-minded traveller who makes the ascent of the great pyramid, or visits the museum of Boulak ? From Bir mingham ! And those gigantic spurs which are used by the gauchos of South America ? And the machetes, or knife-poinards of the Mexicans? And the German tinder-boxes? And the metal trays which are sold so readily in Eastern bazaars ? All come from Bir mingham, where they have well studied the art of imitating curiosities and making relics ! But the reputation of Birmingham is not irreproachable, absolutely, and the term, \"Brummagem goods,\" is in English often ST MARTIN'S CHURCH, BIRMINGHAM. a synonym for rubbish. On the other hand, certain local industries are absolutely unrivalled : the swords, the rifles and guns, the silver-plated articles, the electro-plate, the ironmongery, glass, papier ma chi articles, and the steel pens of Birmingham, are justly and universally celebrated. It is to Messrs. Perry, Mason, Mitchell, and Gillott that we owe the wonderful little steel instruments which have emancipated us from the servitude of the quill and the penknife of our fathers. About the year 1824, Mr. Perry made the first steel pens, which were sold at three shillings and sixpence each. Mr. Mason, one of the most eminent manufacturers of Birmingham, purchased one out of curiosity, and declared he could do better. He immediately made some pens, which he sent to Mr. Perry, who lived in London. The latter gentleman hastened to Birmingham, and it was arranged that Mr. Mason should make the pens, and that Mr. Perry should sell them. So \u2014 and this is a fact little known \u2014 \" Perry's pens \" were really Mason's. In a short time they were sold at one shilling a-piece ; a little later, nine for five shillings, which seemed the very acme of cheapness. At the present time some steel pens fetch only 2id. per gross ! In the meanwhile a young workman of Sheffield came to Birmingham to seek employment, and applied himself to solve the problem of perfecting these pens. Being a skilful engineer, and gifted with rare intelligence, he succeeded in constructing a"], [142, "THE PROVINCES. 130 machine, bv the aid of which he made, in his garret, by himself, more pens than twenty workmen could do by ordinary methods. This young man was the celebrated Gillott whose reputation and fortune rapidly increased, till he became one of the richest English manufacturers. . . . _. ., Every pen passes through a dozen different processes before it is finished. Would you like to know now many 01 mese uiun things Birmingham turns out ? 20,000,000 a week! You can calculate how many that amounts to in a year. Birmingham has a speciality of the small coin of all metals ; after the pens come pins, iron and steel wire, metallic strings for pianos. One house alone makes eight tons of these a week. Jewellery is also a local industry ; there are 50,000 wedding-rings made every year. At Birmingham, also, at the establishment of Messrs. Heaton and Sons, they make the bronze money, where they coin 82,000 penny pieces in twenty-four hours. Lastly, all the canaries in England live in cages made here by 1,000 workmen, who do nothing else. The pin manufactories are very interesting to visit ; they make twelve tons of pins per week. Other estab lishments, where steel, iron, and brass wire hooks and eyes, screw nuts for the railways, nails and buttons, are made, are also well WORKS OF MESSRS.

Screw-making has become an important industry since the introduction of the American automatic machines, which, being supplied with the triangular pieces of iron of the necessary thickness, cut them into pieces, flatten them at one end while making groves in them, twist them and sharpen them at the other extremity, and \" spit \" out \u2014 that is the word \u2014 grosses of screws by the hour, by the day; and one woman is sufficient to attend to ten of these machines. Enormous fortunes have been made in this business during the last twenty years. Amongst the houses which are reckoned the curiosities of Birmingham, we must mention the glass-works of Mr. Osier, the electro-plate establishment of Elkington, the pen manufactories of Gillott, Mitchell, and Perry. At the first-named establishment they made the magnificent lustres of cut glass which adorn the tomb of the Prophet, and the palace of the Khedive at Cairo. In the house in Broad Street are to be seen lustres, table services, vases, fancy- articles"], [143, "THE HIVE. 131 in crystal, cut glass, blown glass, pressed glass, plain, cut, engraved, white or coloured.

Elkington's premises are in Newhall Street, and the firm makes a speciality of plate, particularly gold or silver-plated articles, or electro-plated goods. It is la maison Christofle of England. Its founder, Mr. George Richard Elkington, was a well-known scientist, who had made extensive researches in the art of electro- plating, and who, in 1842, associated himself with one of those men who, by their energy, activity, and tenacious will, overcome all obstacles, \u2014 Sir Joseph Mason. In turn boot- maker, baker, and carpet weaver, Mason, who was a native of Kidderminster, came to Birmingham, where he learned to work in metals. He was soon a passed-master, and to him are due many improve ments made in the manufac ture of steel pens. It was a stroke of good luck to obtain the assistance of such a man, and the energy he infused into the house secured for it in a short time a well-merited repu tation. ASTON HALL, BIRMINGHAM. The quantity of tea-pots, coffee-pots, salvers, vases, epergiies, candlesticks, sugar-basins, forks and spoons produced is positively incalculable. But what has made the establish ment celebrated is the beautiful goldsmiths' work which it has produced, and is daily producing. With commendable foresight the heads of the firm called in the aid of French artists, to whom are entrusted all the designing and artistic work. They prepare the models, they chase the pieces \u2014 such as are sent for exhibition, or which are given as testimonials to illustrious statesmen, or as presents to princes and other personages. Some of these pieces, of which reproductions in electro-plate are shown to visitors, are now celebrated. If one is proud to see English industrial art avading itself of the assistance of French artists \u2014 for there are a number of Frenchmen who put their talents at the disposal of the manufacturers of Great Britain \u2014 one cannot help regretting that our own manufacturers have not been able to retain them, and thus prevent them from carrying abroad with them, with our manufacturing processes, that taste, that delicacy of touch, that art so graceful, so refined, which characterises French productions. People have accused the artists of being wanting in patriotism. That is unjust.

Is not the want of patriotism rather more on the side of the French manufacturers, who are stingy, wishing to make money quickly and in plenty, and by a mistaken economy ruin their business in order to make a rapid fortune ? False calculation ! And the best proof of it is that for thirty years the potters, the goldsmiths, the glass-makers, the upholsterers in England, who have NEW STREET, BIRMINGHAM. given good and lucrative employment to Parisian artists, have managed to make plenty of money, as well as great progress in their business, and have beaten the French manufacturers with their own weapons. A great Parisian tradesman lately blamed a French artist for leaving the country. \" Give me,\" said the artist, \" two-thirds of the income I am now earning, and I am yours.\" The manufacturer held his peace. Have we not here an instance by which those would do well to profit who cry out against foreign competition, to which thev leave the field instead of vigorously attacking it ? Have not our French manufacturers to reproach themselves with some supineness and indolence in this matter ? Here is a question which they may carefully ponder over. Instead of holding forth against English manufacturers who, after all, are only doing what is very natural\u2014 would it not be better to do as they do \u2014 to borrow that which is good from them, and to apply at home the principles which they know so well how to put in practice ?"], [145, "THE HIVE 133 VII.

After having visited the great manufacturing towns, the works and factories, one experiences a feeling of exhaustion easy to understand. \u25a0 The head is filled with the noise of machinery, of hammers striking anvils, the tic-tac of looms; the confused memories of figures and pounds sterling, of yards of textile fabrics, and millions of tons of coal, dance a wild saraband through the brain.

In an hour after leaving Birmingham the train lands us at Coventry, a very ancient town, which has preserved the flavour of antiquity\u2014 a picturesquecharacteristic very rare now-a-days. Situated on undulating ground, Coventry is one^^JoTlhe~cIdest towns in England. When we wander through its streets, which are lined with old houses with pointed roofs, over- THE THREE CHURCHES OF COVENTRY hanging gables, galleries of carved wood, and windows, the woodwork of which is delicately worked, we fancy ourselves carried back to a former age. In the evening, on one of those lovely nights which are not so rare in England as is generally imagined, when the town is wrapped in sleep, we love to wander in the silent streets. The house-roofs are clearly defined against the sky, and throw dark serrated shadows across the roadway. The pale rays of the moon fall between the gables, and form large white patches in the darkness. Fancy peoples the gloomy streets with chubby faced, fat, staggering monks in company with some jovial youths wearing caps, their bodies squeezed into a pourpoint, their lower limbs imprisoned in parti coloured stockings, which are lost in the pointed shoes. They sing a merry song, or launch a gross pleasantry at some belated but not shy beauty, who salutes them with a peal of silvery laughter, and then proceed to empty many pots of beer at the Red Lion Tavern, the sign of which, in sheet-iron, is hanging from an iron rod. To this picture succeeds another.

Mounted on a white palfrey a lady, having no other covering but her luxuriant hair \u2014 longer than a king's robe, says Musset\u2014 proceeds adown the High Street at a foot-pace, and disappears within the gloomy portal of the Castle. This woman is Lady Godiva, submitting to the penalty enacted by her cruel husband, Leofric. The legend is as follows : it ought to be read in the beautiful language of Tennyson, to which no translation would do justice. About the year 1050 the chatelain of Coventry was Leofric, Earl of Mercia, a great hunter before God and man; rough to the lowly, and one who preferred the society of his hounds to that of his spouse, the good and beau tiful Lady Godiva. Leofric, amongst other arbitrary laws, imposed upon the inhabitants a heavy tax, which they had great difficulty to pay ; and while they sought to satisfy their lord and master, they were dying of hunger. Many a time had Godiva begged her husband to free them from this bondage, but he re mained inflexible. But what woman wishes God wills, and Godiva was sworn to succeed. One day, determined to obtain the release of the people, she went to her husband, who was playing with his dogs, and for the hundredth time begged and prayed him, with tears in her eyes and in her voice, to remove TRINITY CHURCH, COVENTRY. the odious tax. Seignor Leofric was in a very bad temper that day, and the tears of his wife, far from softening, exasperated him ! He conceived a strangely cruel idea. \"I will grant your request,\" he said, \"if you will ride naked through the town.\" \" But, my lord, will you permit me to do such a thing as that ? \" \" Yes,\" he replied. On the day appointed, therefore, Lady Godiva, \" clothed on with chastity,\" as Tennyson says, rode through the town on horseback; while the inhabitants, as if to read their lord a lesson, and at the same time respecting the modesty of his wife, kept indoors. She was thus enabled to pass through Coventry, without a single person glancing indiscreetly at the charms of the virtuous spouse of Leofric. Nevertheless,"], [148, "THE PROVINCES. 136 one attempted to do so; he was a tailor, and could not resist the temptation; so he peeped through a shutter.

As for the Lady Godiva, she returned to the castle, and had the satisfaction of receiving from the hands of Leofric the charter which declared Coventry free and independent Such is the legend which Tennyson has, so to speak, cast in bronze, and which is KENILWORTH CASTLE (FROM THE ROAD). 4 sure to live as long as the world lasts, despite the learned ones who maintain that none of the old historians mention the legend, aud who attribute to the procession which formerly took place in Coventry in commemoration of Lady Godiva, a less elevated and poetic origin. They pretend that it is only a relic of the by no means moral amusements of the licentious court of Charles II. However that may be, the traditional procession has \" gone to join the old moons,\" which is a great pity. During the last thirty years it has only taken place at intervals of two or three years; the municipal authorities, headed by the mayor, are present, and the person of Godiva is represented by a female member of a travelling circus company in \" tights.\" Besides its numerous old houses, Coventry possesses some remarkable monuments."], [149, "THE HIVE. 137 The churches of St. Michael, the Trinity, and Christ Church\u2014 whose pointed spires, so close together, have a curious effect\u2014 are, particularly the two first-named, very interesting.

Before quitting this town, we must refer to the English phrase about sending one to Coventry. There are many versions given of the origin of it, the most plausible of which is that at a certain period the inhabitants of the town had a feeling of hos tility towards the army, and would not on any consideration receive the officers of the garrison in their houses, so the soldiers were reduced to their own society. Whence the expression to send to Coventry, that is to say, to banish anyone from good company ; and by extension to repulse one roughly. From Coventry to Kenilworth is a journey of a quarter of an hour by rail way. Kenilworth is a small town, consisting of one wide irregular street, intersected by lateral thoroughfares, in which no one would remain were it not for the curiosity which impels tourists to visit the ruins of the famous castle of Simon de Montfort, more generally celebrated since Walter Scott adapted it to the plot of one of his novels. It was situated CHIMNEYPIECE IN KENILWORTH CASTLE. to the west of the town upon a rising ground, and the waters of the lake laved the foot of the wall. This lake is now only a slimy marsh. The castle, properly so called, which was protected by a double enceinte, consisted of many blocks of buildings of imposing appearance, whose thick, solid walls were battlemented and machicolated, and united by massive square towers. Between the outer and inner walls extended a large garden, with flower-beds and shady thickets. It was here, in the midst of the fetes, that Leicester received Elizabeth, and caused to be put to death the noble Amy Robsart \u2014 foully calumniated by the traitor Varney. What now remains of this lordly dwelling, once so rich and so magnificent, whose apartments filled with rare furniture, the richest tapestry, the most precious objects of art, presented a coup d'\u0153il of the greatest splendour, and of the most refined luxury ?

A nameless slab covers it, on which is carved the following inscription : \u2014 \"good frend, for iesvs sake forbear e, to digg the dvst encloased heare; blest be ye man yt spares thes stones, and cvrst be he yt moves my bones.\""], [159, "THE HIVE. 147 It is needless to say that this verse is not Shakespeare's. Against the wall above tlie tomb we find the monument raised to the poet a short time after his death. It consists of a niche shading a bust of the immortal creator of \"Hamlet,\" who is represented with his left hand resting on a sheet of paper, while in the right he holds his pen. The bust by Johnson, which was originally coloured, was (in 1793) whitewashed. This act of Vandalism was repaired in 1861. The white layer which dis figured the bust was re moved, and a skilful restor ation has given it its former character. The eyes are a clear brown, and the hair, which is thin on the top of the head, is of chestnut hue, like the beard. A red pour point, and a sleeveless body garment, with a wide black collar, complete the poet's costume. Tradition affirms that this bust was sculptured from a cast taken after ROOM IN WHICH SHAKESPEARE WAS BORN. death; it should be, then, the authentic portrait of Shakespeare. A fact which. seems to confirm this statement is that an engraved portrait which adorns one of the first editions of his works resembles in a strking manner the bust executed by Johnson. Besides, we must not forget that the monument was erected during the lifetime of Shakespeare's wife and children, and that if the portrait which is thought to be like him did not resemble him they would have protested against it as a profanation. Now we have no evidence of such a protest, and we are therefore constrained to believe that the statue at Stratford has transmitted faithfully to posterity the features of the immortal genius to whom England is so proud of having given birth. On two sides of the niche small black marble columns support an entablature, surmounted by an escutcheon with the armorial bearings of Shakespeare. In the same church we find the tombs of his widow and his two daughters. In the square at Stratford, in front of the Town Hall, is a statue of Shakespeare, presented to the town by Garrick, the actor, in 1769, and in the interior of the Town Hall are preserved several remarkable paintings, of which the principal are the portrait of the poet and that of Garrick, by Gainsborough. One mile from Stratford, in the village of Shottery, we are shown a picturesque cottage which tradition indicates as the dwelling of Anne Hathaway before her marriage with Shakespeare. This little house is called Anne Hathaway's Cottage."], [160, "THE THAMES AT OXFORD. CHAPTER THE FOURTH -OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE. oxford and its monuments. \u2014 the university. THE students and their habits. CAMBRIDGE. THE BANKS OF THE CAM. THE COLLEGES. The majority of the foreigners who come to England content themselves with walking through the principal streets of London, and returning home under the impression that they have seen the country. If they get only as far as Windsor, Great Britain has no secrets from them ; they have it at their fingers' ends ! But there is a town, curious amongst all others, with the name of which everyone is familiar, which is only one hour aud three quarters distant from Regent Street, and which, nevertheless, few people go to see. This town is Oxford, the seat of the celebrated University. We can say as much for Cambridge, the sister University ; both are at about the same distance from the Metropolis. Oxford is 63 miles from London, on the Great Western, and London and North Western Railways. The city is agreeably situated in a beautiful plain, surrounded by"], [161, "OXFORD"], [162, "THE PROVINCES. 150 hills, at the confluence of two rivers, the Cherwell and the Thames, which here bears the classic and poetic name of Isis. Shortly before we reach the town we perceive, rising above the willows which border the river as from an ocean of verdure, the domes and spires of Oxford. The name is not derived, as is so often stated, from ox and ford\u2014 an etvmolo-v which is ridiculous on all accounts; it is simply a corruption of Ousenford, the ford over the Ouse, a name by which the Isis was formerly known. Its legendary origin, according to some authorities, dates as far back as the year 1009 B.C. ; according to others, to the year 727 of the Christian Era ; but it is generally agreed that Oxford did not actually exist before the reign of Alfred the Great, who es tablished schools there and so founded the old Univer sity, which yields only in age to that of Paris. Oxford was burnt in 1013, and in 1032 by the Danes; it was taken by storm in 1037 by the Normans. After the terrible conflagration of 1190, which scarcely left a house standing, stone was substituted for wood in its reconstruction, and since then the history of the city presents no incident of national interest, except the Convocation of Parlia ment there by Charles II. in 1681. \"LAUD\" PORCH OF ST. MARY'S CHURCH (OXFORD). The University on the contrary has experienced many vicissitudes. It was originally composed of houses called \" Halls,\" of which there were a hundred inhabited by students. The University was in a very prosperous condition, possessing, it is said, 30,000 students, or pupils would be more correct, for many of them were quite young children when, in the reign of Henry III. (in 1229), the frequent quarrels between the townspeople and the students caused the dispersion of the latter, who were"], [163, "HIGH STREET (OXFORD)."], [164, "sHE PROVINCES. 152 replaced by one thousand scholars of the Paris University, summoned to England by the King. Towards the end of the 13th century the inhabitants petitioned that the students might be permitted to return to Oxford. The Bishop, Walter de Merton, framed the statutes of the University, which were soon afterwards adopted by Cambridge. Under 'Edward III. the disputes recommenced between the town and University, and in one celebrated encounter sixty-two students were left on the field. The traditional rivab'y is still kept alive, and, till quite recently, too, Oxford was the scene of periodical scenes of disorder, and encounters between the townsmen and the students. We need not say that the townspeople did not begin the fray. These disturbances are called Town and Gown riots. Under Richard II. , and in the 16th century, religious controversy embittered all minds. Bishops Latimer, Ridley, and Cranmer, victims of Bloody Mary, died at the stake for their reformed faith. In later days the University supported the Stuarts, and preserved a fidelity to them against which George I. and George II. strove in vain. After the 18th century the city ceased to take an active part in politics, and contented itself by attending to its own proper business. The University is a body constituted under that name \u2014 the Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford \u2014 which has the right to send two representa- MAGDALEN TilWER (OXFORD). tives to Parliament. The Chancellor (at present Lord Salisbury) is elected for life; his functions are honorary, and he only appears on grand occasions. The Vice- Chancellor, elected for a year from amongst the principals of the colleges, is the real head of the University, which is administered by a Council of eighteen chosen members, and five e,x officio members, who are the Chancellor, the Vice-Chancellor, the ex-Vice- Chancellor, and the two Proctors, charged specially to maintain discipline within the limits of Alma Mater. Instruction is given in the Colleges, which number twenty-one. The most ancient"], [165, "OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE. 153 is University College, founded in 872, and the most recent is Keble College, founded in 1870. These Colleges are also constituted bodies, each having its own special organization, which is composed of a Master, or Warden; Fellows and students. The Colleges and the University occupy relatively the same positions vis-a-vis to each other as the different cantons of Switzerland and the Helvetian Confederation. The conferring of degrees rests exclusively with the University, as do also the arrangement and control of the examinations, with the exception of the entrance- examinations, which are conducted by the Colleges. When the candidate has passed his entrance examina- tion (matriculated), and been presented to the Vice- Chancellcr, he is inscribed on the books of the Univer - sity. To obtain the degree of Bachelor of Arts, the student, who after his entry is dubbed an undergraduate, must pass nine terms of eight weeks each in the University, and satisfy the examiners. There are four terms a year, but the student spends scarcely twenty-four weeks of the year at Oxford. He must reside there three years to become a B.A. At the end of three years more, and without examination, the Bachelor can, if he please, obtain his degree of Master STAIRCASE OF CHRIST CHURCH COLLEGE (OXFORD). of Arts, which gives him the right to vote for candidates for Parliament. Such, in a few words, is the constitution of the University of Oxford, and, with slight modifica tions, that of Cambridge also. From 1630 to 185-1 no alterations were made, and those which were introduced by the Act of Parliament of the latter date, while ordering necessary reforms, respected the principle of the original constitution of the University. Nearly all the old customs have, by degrees, disappeared, but two or three still"], [166, "THE PROVINCES. 154 remain. Thus at Queen's College, every Christmas, a boar's head is served with great ceremony. All the students assemble in the Hall ; the Bursar, preceded by a troop of choristers and assistants, advances gravely, carrying upon a silver dish the famous Boar's Head, while the choristers sing a lay, the burthen of which is taken up by the students. Then the decorations of the dish are distributed. This ceremony commemorates the heroic conduct of a student who, surprised in the forest by a furious wild boar, and having no other weapon but his \" Aristotle,\" which he was reading, thrust it down his open jaws, calling out \" Gr\u0153cum est,\" and the animal expired, suffocated by the works of the chief of the peripatetic philo- sopners. At Queen's College, also, the gates are securely fastened while the meal is being eaten, a custom which arose in the Town and Gown epoch, with the view to prevent a sur prise and an attack by the townspeople. Leaving the railway station, we traverse a somewhat poor quarter of the town, and after cross ing the Isis, we pass the castle (a modern structure, imitating Norman archi- FACADE AND QUADRANGLE OF CHRIST CHURCH COLLEGE (OXFORD) tecture), which serves as a court-house and a prison. At the end of Queen Street are cross-roads, whose junction is called Carfax (a corruption of quatre voies), and then we come in view of the celebrated High Street, which divides Oxford into two equal parts. Lined on both sides with churches and buddings whose lofty spires. cupolas, towers \u2014 some massive, others pointed and bold, stand out in relief against the blue sky; gardens with brilliant flower-beds, thick trees, whose green branches appear above the walls of the colleges; crowded with undergraduates in University costume, the High Street presents an appearance in the highest degree picturesque, and we cannot accuse the English of exaggeration when they claim this sight as unique in the world. There is on the left, St. Martin's Church, rebuilt fifty years ago, but the tower of which dates from the 14th century; then the tower of All Saints, and, above all, St. Mary's, whose elegant spire, 135 feet high, rises proudly into the air. All Souls' College is beside it, and faces University College, the entrance to which is so remarkable. Farther on, and still on the left, is Queen's College, and, lastly, at the end of the street, Magdalen, in an admirable situation on the banks of the"], [167, "OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE. 155 Cherwell, surrounded by beautiful trees, on which looks down the celebrated tower that is one of the gems of Oxford. We must not neglect to walk through the High Street, and examine the details of its buildings, their architecture, and their various dates, but of so curious a character, and which the climate has reclothed with an mcrustationthat gives to every one, even to the most recent, the appear ance of antiquity. Antique also is the costume of the students, who, at certain hours, must not go out without their caps and gowns. The students live in the colleges, where they have two rooms each. Should there be no room in college, they live in furnished lodgings, bcensed to receive students. Although enjoying considerable liberty, they must submit to a pretty rigorous dis cipline. They must attend chapel at least once a day, and follow a certain course of THE AVENUE, CHRIST CHURCH COLLEGE (OXFORD), study, but there is no general rule, each coUege having its own. Students are forbidden to frequent hotels and taverns, and to be in the streets after nine o'clock at night. All undergraduates found out of college between the hours of ten o'clock, p.m., and six a.m., are subject to a fine. If he sleeps out of college, an undergraduate is liable 48"], [168, "THE PROVINCES. 156 to severe punishment. The penalties in force are the money fine, rustication, or temporarv expulsion, and final expulsion, which is rarely resorted to. The English student, whether from temperament or because he goes in for athletic exercises, such as swimming, cricket, canoeing, gymnastics, and other pastimes, has not, like his French prototype, a taste for \" adventure.\" Journeys to Paphos are not in his line- besides, in this respect Oxford is very strictly guarded, and offers no temptation. There is no large town in the vicinity, and London is rather far off. Some, however, make the journey to the capital. Life at the University passes peacefully, but it is costly. Non licet omnibus adire Corinthum. The least that a student must spend is \u00a3300 a year, and, on the average, he remains at the University only six months of that time. The dinners he gives-for he must do as others do\u2014 the wine parties in the evening, at which he sometimes drinks more than he ought, cause him to spend more than his income. If he comes of a wealthy family, he gets into debt, and his father always pays his debts to avoid scandal, as the Oxford tradesmen know very well he wdl do. If he is poor he must borrow at exorbitant rates, and great is the number of young men who, many years after they have quitted the University, impose hard labour on them selves to pay the money-lenders. Dinner is partaken of, in common, in hall. The Fellows are seated at a special table raised above those of the under graduates. The grace before and FACADE OF ORIEL COLLEGE (OXFORD). after meat is recited in Latin, with an accent which sounds strangely in the ears of Frenchmen. A great novelist relates in his Memoirs that at the time of the occupation he spoke Latin with an English officer who did not know a word of French. This seems absolutely incredible, for it is impossible for a French Latin scholar to under stand an English Latinist, and vice-versa. There are two sets of students \u2014 the \" classmen \" and the \" passmen.\" The former o-o in for honours, the latter, who are the more numerous, content themselves with the B.A. degree, and immediately leave the University. Besides the students who belong to the colleges, there have been introduced since 1868 \"unattached\" students; but of the 10,000 uudergraduates on the books, scarcely 300 are \" unattached.\" One may easily spend two or three days, and even more, in visiting the numerous colleges in Oxford, its buildings, and its churches, without including the environs. In a short visit it is impossible to see everything ; but one should not omit to see Christ Church College and the Cathedral, Magdalen College, the libraries, the museums, and the picture galleries. Christ Church College is in St. Aldate Street \u2014 one of the four streets which radiate from Carfax. It was founded by Wolsey in 1525, and built upon the old convent of"], [169, "OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE. 157 Saint Frideswide. Its facade extends for 360 feet ; in the centre an elegant gateway, flanked by two Gothic towers, with pear-shaped cupolas, and surmounted by a third and much larger tower in the same style, gives access to the grand quadrangle. The statue above the entrance gate is that of the founder of the College. At the end of this fine quadrangle a wide staircase leads to the hall, or refectory,\u2014 a magnificent apartment of carved wood, and ornamented by alternate escutcheons of Wolsey and Henry VIII. The ceiling (also of carved oak) displays the same decorations, and the walls are hung with portraits, some of which are very interesting. Those of Wolsey and Henry VIII. COURTYARD OF ORIEL COLLEGE (OXFORD). by Holbein, Queen Elizabeth, by Zucchero, Canning, by Lawrence, and Hooper, by Hogarth are in this category. The Cathedral, which serves as the CoUege chapel, and is a portion of the College, was formerly a dependence of the Convent of Saint Frideswide. Wolsey demolished a portion of it, but left the spire standing; it was found necessary to repair and strengthen this some years ago. Restored in 1856, the Cathedral is of many periods, but the Norman style predominates. The choir is particularly interesting, with its superposed arches and the ceding with its delicate mouldings and graceful pendentives. The beautiful rose-window is modern, so are the choir stalls. The Lady, or Latin, Chapel, which opens from the choir, is so named because there prayers are said in Latin at the beginning of each term. It is embellished with antique stalls, and contains three remarkable tombs, one of which is of the 13th century. It is believed to be that of thc Prior of the ancient convent. The tomb of Elizabeth de Montacute, whose tinted ettigy has retained its colouring, is also very curious. A beautiful garden separates the Cathedral from another quadrangle, called Peck-"], [170, "THE PROVINCES. 158 water, surrounded by buildings that contain the College library, which is also a museum, wherein are some fine paintings of the Italian school. Behind the college extend gardens which occupy all the peninsula formed by the rivers Cherwell and Isis, and traversed by fine walks shaded with splendid old elms. Large boats \u2014 barges, \u2014which were formerly used in the Lord Mayor's procession, are moored alongside the bank, and their cabins are adapted for \u25a0\" studies.\" The students of Oxford are great water-men, and the boat-races and oarsmen of the University are celebrated. Every year the contest of the University eights takes place on the Thames. After practising on the Isis for some weeks, the eights go into training at or near the place where the race is rowed. This event, which formerly had merely an interest for members of the Universities and their friends, has become a national, or rather a metropolitan, holiday. Six weeks in advance the news- papers give daily reports of the eights, their progress, the names of the crews, their weights, the changes that take place in the boats, \u2014 all are minutely chro- nicled. Betting is indulged in; during the week previous to the race the shops exhibit plentifully in their windows ties, ribbons, and rosettes of the Oxford and Cambridge colours \u2014 dark and light blue respectively. The cab drivers and omnibus men tie up their whips with a bit of blue ribbon of the colour cf the QUADRANGLE OF MAGDALEN COLLEGE i (OXFORD). Hi c^wear \"Oxford\" or \"Cambridge\" ties without and stdl less what goes on there.

The strangest vehicles are put in requisition, and the streets of London, particularly in the City are deserted. On the banks of the river the crowds are enormous, and nine-tenths of the spectators see absolutely nothing at all ! The rival crews appear, launch their ST. JOHN'S COLLEGE (OXFORD). boats, and take up their positions. At a given signal the oars are dropped, pulled vigorously by sixteen strong arms, and the eights fly over the water, followed by four steamers, \u2014 one for the umpire, one for each University, and one for the press. The thirty-ninth annual race was won by Oxford in 1883, which put 21 to its credit. Cambridge up to that time had only won 17. (The race in 1877 was a dead heat.) Since then Oxford has won 22, and Cambridge 19, including that of 1886. In the evening the crews dine together, and fraternise over copious libations of champagne. But we have wandered far away from Oxford ; let us re-ascend the Thames, or Isis; let us traverse the quadrangles of Christ Church, and, emerging by the Canterbury Gate \u2014 a kind of Greco-Roman portal \u2014 continue our way down Merton Street, wherein we"], [172, "THE PROVINCES. 160 find-on the left, Oriel College ; aud ou tbe right, those of Corpus Christi aud Merton A narrow street, King Street, opening from \"The High,\" brings us almost face to face with Mao-dalen Collesre, which is pronounced Maudlenn.

In a corner a low arched passage leads to the cloisters, which are surmounted by a square tower with pinnacles, and in the wall on the opposite side is a curious stone pulpit, in which the preacher for merly held forth on St. John's Day, but it is no longer used. The chapel has been recently restored, after having been plundered several times. Cromwell, who was received in 1649 by the President of the college, who afforded him hospitality, could find no better way to recompense his entertainer than by carrying off to Hampton Court the organ which had delighted him. The hall only dates from 1790: it is panelled with wood carvings, representing the chief events in the life of Mary Magdalen. The walls are decorated \u2014 like RADCLIFFE LIBRARY (OXFORD). all the other \"halls,' with portraits of the benefactors, and the most illustrious members of the college. A narrow passage leads to the chaplain's quadrangle, from which we can admire the beautiful tower, 145 feet high, the design for which, tradi tion tells us, was furnished by Wolsey, and from the summit of which, on the 1st of May, the students sing a Latin hymn \u2014 an old custom still observed. However, to judge of the beautiful proportions of the tower we should stand upon the bridge"], [173, "OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE. 161 over the river, from which spot we can also see, on the left, the cathedral of Christ Church College. Reascending the High Street, we perceive, op posite to Magdalen College, the Botanic Garden, the entrance to QUADRANGLE OF BRASENOSE COLLEGE (OXFORDjl which is guarded by itatues of Charles I. .and Charles II. Farther on, behind St. Mary's Church, we find the Radcliffe Library, a fine rotunda, in the classic style, surmounted by a dome resting"], [174, "THE PROVINCES. 162 upon an octagonal base, whence a splendid view of Oxford and all its buildings may be enjoyed. The panorama which spreads itself before the spectator is very beautiful, and no one will regret making the ascent. The Bodleian Library is at the back. Founded by Thomas Bodley, in 1602, it contains 400,000 volumes and 30,000 MSS., of which many are of rare value. It is enriched every year by new acquisitions, and also in consequence of an Act of Parliament which obliges every publisher to forward a copy BANKS OF THE CAM (CAMBRIDGE). of every work he publishes to the British Museum and the Bodleian Library. Above the Library is a picture gallery, in which are some paintings, chiefly of historical value. The Sheldonian Theatre, built by Wren, is a hall in which every year, before the Long Vacation, a ceremony called \" Commemoration \" takes place, in honour of the founders of the University. This ceremony chiefly consists in conferring honorary degrees upon great personages and political men of mark. On these occcasions the undergraduates, who are seated in the gallery, find extreme pleasure in playing practical jokes, and passing comments worthy of the titis of the Paris Boulevard theatres, in throwing crackers, uttering cries of animals, and generally making a hideous uproar. To put an end to this state of things, the \" Dons \" conceived the idea of putting ladies"], [175, "OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE. 163 in the galleries, instead of isolating them in the body of the hall. This course, though it has not cured, has considerably mitigated, the evil. The Ashmolean Museum, so called from its founder, Ashmole, was originady a natural history collection ; a museum of books, manuscripts, and Grecian, Roman, and Saxon antiquities, collected by Ashmole in the 17th century. The Museum now contains neither a natural history collection nor books; the latter are now in the Bodleian Library, and the former in the new Museum, situated in the park. Amongst the curiosities in the Ashmolean Museum, the most interesting are the jewel which adorned the sceptre of King Alfred (\"Alfred's jewel\"), the sword of Henry VIII., Queen Elizabeth's hunting-boots, and Cromwell's watch. The antiquities BRIDGE OF SIGHS (CAMBRIDGE). include arms, money, and, above all, the celebrated Arundel marbles\u2014 antique tablets, engraven in Greek characters, discovered at Paros in the 16th century\u2014 which have so materially assisted us in our knowledge of Grecian history. They were presented to the University in 1867, by the Earl of Arundel. All those buildings in Broad Street belong, strictly speaking, to the University, and form an imposing mass of great effect, architecturally. After \"The High,\" Broad Street is the most beautiful in Oxford. The great building, which stands at the corner of Broad and Magdalen Streets, is Balliol College, in front of which Latimer, Ridley, and Cranmer were' burned. A monument, commemorative of this event, erected after the design of Scott, is to be seen at the side of St. Mary's Church. It consists of a Gothic spire, of the kind which stands in the court of the Charing Cross Railway Station, in London, resting upon a hexagonal basement. Three niches are occupied 49"], [176, "THE PROVINCES. 164 by statues of the martyrs, which are from the chisel of Weeks, a pupil of Chantrey. This monument is called the \"Martyrs' Memorial.\" The church of St. Mary Magdalen is very ordinary, and is only remarkable by its form, being broader than it is long. It has been restored so many times that scarcely any of the original construction, built in the 14th century, remains. So we shall do better to proceed direct to the University Museum of Painting and Sculpture (the \u00bb\u25a0\"*\u25a0?\u2014 f \u25a0\u00bb\u25a0.-\u2022 University Gal leries) , near the Memorial, oppo site Taylor's Build ings, a compara- queen's college (Cambridge). tively recent erec- tion, founded by Taylor in 1788, for the acquirement of living languages. The University Galleries include one of sculpture, wherein are exhibited the original models of Chantrey's works, amongst which we find the charming group of the \" Sleeping Children,\" the marble copy of which is in Lichfield Cathedral. The Gallery of Paintings contains fifty designs by Turner, a collection of 162 original designs of Raphael, and 77 of Michael Angelo, the greater number of which are sketches for their best known works. Nothing can be more interesting than these sketches, in which is manifest all the primary inspiration of these masters. The pictures belong chiefly to the Flemish and Florentine schools. We remark, also, some portraits"], [177, "OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE. 165 by Reynolds, and many canvases by Canaletti, Van Ostade, and Teniers, as well as some designs of Hogarth. Oxford possesses, besides its colleges\u2014 a complete description of which would fill a volume \u2014 a town had, a laboratory, a museum of natural history ; and many old houses, KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL (CAMBRIDGE). the most curious of which is that of the first Bishop of Oxford ; the facade, rebuilt in the 17th century, is embellished with wood-carvings and curious caryatides. This mansion \u2014 Bishop King's House \u2014 is situated in St. Aldate Street, and is well worthy of a visit. But of which of the monuments of Oxford cannot one say as much ?

This assemblage of palaces, surrounded by gardens, churches, temples\u2014 ornate with dehcate sculpture, statues, colonnades, domes, cupolas, spires, and towers-affords a never-to-be-forgotten spectacle. From Oxford to Cambridge is a long distance, but there is scarcely need of the transition from Oxford to Cambridge, so closely do the two Universities resemble each other. In common parlance, Oxford and Cambridge are two words which are no more separated than the name of Orestes from that of Pylades. KING'S COLLEGE (CAMBRIDGE). Cambridge is situated in a wide valley upon the banks of the Cam, which gives its name to it. Cambridge is very far from having such a picturesque appearance as Oxford, and at a little distance it seems very commonplace. This first impression will be modified after one has explored the town and its numerous colleges and churches. As far as the organization of its University and the colleges \u2014 the course of instruc tion, the life of the students, their manners and customs \u2014 are concerned, Cambridge differs in no material degree from the sister University. There are seventeen colleges; the number of students on the books is 11,469. The Duke of Devonshire has been the Chancellor of the University since 1860. The principal colleges are situated on the right bank of the Cam, from which they are separated by pleasant meadows planted with old trees. The fronts of the colleges look upon the street, and are generally very beautiful ; but the river-side is the most picturesque. Thence long avenues of trees lead up to the courts, or \" quads.,\" with"], [179, "OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE. 167 pinnacles and turrets shooting up above the mass of verdure. The Cam wends its way between the wooded banks, and is crossed by numerous bridges, the effect of which is ENTRANCE TO KING'S COLLEGE (CAMBRIDGE). very remarkable, as nearly every college has its own particular bridge. One of the most curious is that of St. John's College, which connects the buildings on both sides of the river ; it is called the \" Bridge of Sighs,\" and as a matter of fact, there is something Venetian in the appearances of these bridges, so close together, spanning this limpid river, bounded on one side by edifices which have quite a palatial air. The chief bridges are those of Trinity, Clare, King's and Queen's Colleges. As the Oxonians boast, and with reason, of their High Street, the Cantabs victoriously respond that there is nothing in Oxford which can equal the beauty of the backs of the colleges of Cambridge. The principal colleges are in Trumpington Street, which is parallel to the river, and, MILTON'S MULBERRY TREE. when coming from the railway station, we traverse it from end to end, passing successively the Museum and Fitzwilliam Library, opposite to which is Pembroke College, the facade of which is wanting in character, and, in front, St. Peter's College. We then reach Queen's College, on the left, and St. Catherine's, on the right ; the"], [180, "THE PROVINCES. 168 former one of the most picturesque, the latter one of the least noteworthy. The street then extends and forms an open space or \" place,\" called King's Parade, wherein are many important monuments. First, there is King's College, founded by Henry VI. in 1440. The entrance-gate is very elegant. The \" quads.\" and the buildings are extensive and imposing, but none of them are equal in beauty to the chapel, which is the most celebrated building in Cambridge. A portal, prettily carved, gives access to the chapel, the arched roof of which is ornamented with stone mullions of rare delicacy and elegance. The walls are panelled with wainscoting, richly carved, as well as the CLARE COLLEGE BRIDGE (CAMBRLDGE). organ screen. The choir stalls date from the time of Henry VIII., and the doors from the age of Charles I. Light is admitted to this beautiful building by twenty-five windows of brilliant stained glass, each divided into four compartments, placed two by two, and representing in the upper panels scenes from the Old Testament, in the lower scenes from the New. A staircase leads to the roof of the chapel, from which the view of Cambridge and its environs is extremely beautiful. Opposite King's rises the square pinnacled tower of the University Church (Great St. Mary's Church), a building in the Perpendicular style, consisting of a nave with aisles, the whole crinilated like a fortress. Caius College is also on the King's Parade. It was founded by Dr. Caius, a physician, in the time of Queen Mary.

Behind Caius arises the mass of buildings com prising Trinity College, founded in 1546, by Henry VIII. It encloses four spacious quadrangles, to which access is gained by a fine entrance supported by two towers, called the \"King's Gateway.\" The most interesting portions of the college are, the chapel, which opens from a hall embellished with statues, representing the most illustrious students of Trinity, amongst which are Lord Bacon, the Chancellor; state entrance, caius college (Cambridge).

It was founded in 1516, and finished in 1624. One of the quadrangles is upon the left bank of the Cam; it dates from 1831; and is called the New Buildings. The others, although ancient, have nothing remarkable about them. The chapel, notwithstanding its antique appearance, was only built in 1863-69.

It is very interesting to see the various boats practising on the Cam, which then assumes a most animated appearance. On certain occasions the boats of all the colleges go down the river in procession, and it is very curious to see this long file of boats gliding gently over the waters of the Cam, the banks of which are lined with spectators, who cheer the boats in a way which only those possessed of British lungs can attempt. So far as study is concerned, the two Universities are on a par ; and if Oxford has the reputation of turning out some splendid \" classics,\" Cambridge can pride herself on her unrivalled mathematicians. Besides the two great Universities, there are in England those of London, Durham, and Manchester (Victoria University). The University of Durham was founded in 1831, and that of Manchester in 1880. The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge are each represented in Parliament by two members, the London University by one. Durham and Manchester are not represented. There are ladies' colleges at both Oxford and Cambridge, and degrees are conferred upon the female students as well as upon the inferior sex BRIDGE OVER THE CAM (KING'S BRIDGE)."], [185, "THE MERSEY AT LIVERPOOL. CHAPTER THE FIFTH.-THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS I. MARITIME COMMERCE. LIVERPOOL : CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS MONUMENTS. \u2014 THE MERSEY, THE PORT, THE DOCKS. BIRKENHEAD. NEW BRIGHTON. THE ISLE OF MAN. Without entering into philosophical discussions concerning the destinies of nations, it is impossible to deny that England, by its very position, must be a maritime nation : for what are you to do in an island unless you can go down to the sea in ships ? The English have navigated much, and in all ages. Being an amphibious race, they are quite in their element at sea, and they have for the ocean a curious devotion. To the coast population nothing is more beautiful than a boat : to be master on board ship, to pace the deck of your own vessel, is, in the eyes of all English lads, the lot most to be envied ; it is the dream of all school-boys. The inland population regard the sea as an old friend which they revisit on every occasion when a pleasure-party or a hodday permits them to leave the workshop or the counter; it is, above all, the great health dispenser. To go and breathe the sea air is the English panacea for every dl that flesh is heir to. This love for the sea, the taste for adventure innate in the English, must necessarily bear fruit, and result in the possession of a colonial empire without a parallel in history. In all parts of the world the Englishman is at home. His colonies, established at certain distances apart, surround the world like a chain. What prodigious strides have been made since 1583 \u2014 300 years ago, when England annexed her first colony, Newfoundland \u2014 until 1883, when she installed herself in Egypt ! Picture to yourselves the extent of this empire, which possesses in Europe \u2014 Heligoland, Gibraltar, Malta, and Cyprus ; in Asia \u2014 Aden, Ceylon, the peninsula of Malacca, North Borneo, the East"], [186, "THE PROVINCES. 174 Indies, Labuan, Hong Kong, and Burmah ; in Africa \u2014 Perim, Socotra, Ascension, St. Helena, Mauritius, the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, Lagos, the Cape, Natal, and Griqualand ; in America\u2014 Newfoundland, Canada, Guiana, Honduras, the Bahamas, Bermudas, the Falkland Islands, Jamaica, the Windward Isles, Trinidad, and the Leeward Isles ; in Oceania\u2014 New South Wales, New Zealand, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, West Australia, and the Fiji Islands. Now just glance at the map of the world, and if you find a single strait, a single maritime passage which is not marked as a British possession, or over which the British flag does not wave, you may be sure that that passage leads nowhere \u2014 or if it does, that CANNING DOCK AND THE CUSTOM HOUSE (LIVERPOOL). the English have found another, shorter, or less dangerous way to its termination. And all these colonial possessions are flourishing ; inhabited by English people, who establish themselves there, and bring about, by means of their aptitude for negotiation and colonisation, an ever -increasing prosperity. England in this manner disposes of her surplus population, and the emigrants who quit the mother country are for her a new source of strength and riches, by creating in all parts of the world outlets for her commerce and national industries. When we think that a man has actuaUy been discovered who could write upon the \" Decadence of England,\" we stand confounded in the presence of so much bigotry \u2014 or blindness ! How otherwise is it possible not to see that these colonies growing up, living a life of their own, like Canada, and more particularly like Australia, enjoying complete inde pendence, performing their own business, governing themselves as they please, far from weakening Great Britain, are just so many young Englands, whose federation will, one of these days, assure to the Anglo-Saxon race the Empire of the World ! By the very"], [187, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 175 fact of its organization, \" shreds and patches,\" united by the strong ties of patriotism, England can resist crises and storms which would sweep a homogeneous country off the face of the earth ; even one, or several, of the colonies could detach themselves from the whole body without the Empire suffering in any sensible degree. But that is a very far-fetched hypothesis, for English politicians rarely commit the same mistake twice over, and the American War of Independence will not have a second edition. In contradistinction to what occurs in other countries, the British colonies, like the institutions of the mother country, suffice for themselves. They are essentially self supporting, and every colony which, not being strictly necessary from a strategic point ST. GEORGE'S HALL (LIVERPOOL). of view, would cost money, if only a few hundred pounds, to English tax-payers, woidd be very quickly left to its fate. But there is no need to speculate upon this, firstly, because the English take good care only to choose profitable colonies ; and secondly, because commercial transactions with the British possessions increase every year something like \u00a35, 000,000 sterling. In such cases as these we must resort to figures, nothing being so convincing, as lawyers say. Here they are. In 1882 the British colonies sent to the mother country \u00a3100,000,000 worth of commodities, and have bought of her more than \u00a392,000,000 worth (millions sterling, be it understood). So the commerce of England with her colonies amounts to nearly \u00a3200,000,000 sterling annually. Nevertheless, this respectable sum amounts only to two-sevenths of the value of the commerce of England, which in the same year (1882) reached \u00a3719,680,322 sterling. It may be stated that in this total the imports figure for \u00a3413,019,608, and the exports for \u00a3306,660,714 sterling only. This enormous traffic being conducted by sea \u2014 an axiom of La Palisse, which they"], [188, "THE PROVINCES. 176 forget too often on the continent, where a ton of merchandise can be transported from one end of Europe to the other without transhipment \u2014 depends exclusively upon the merchant navy, and on the ports of Great Britain. The latter, like the conduits of some immense suction and force pump, attract from all corners of the universe, their various commodities, which are thence distributed to all nations of the globe. This work of centralization and distribution keeps employed, on the average, a fleet of 24,000 vessels, steamers and sailing ships, of an aggregate of 7,000,000 tons register, manned by 200,000 sailors, without reckoning the colonial vessels. As every ship makes several voyages yearly, the movement of the British merchant marine is continuous. Here are the totals officially published by the Board of Trade for the year 1882: LORD STREET (LIVERPOOL). English vessels entered and cleared, 79,110; foreign vessels, 51,485. Adding up these totals, we find that in that one year the ports of tbe United Kingdom recorded the entry and clearing outwards of 130,595 ships, of an aggregate burthen of 61,000,000 tons. And we must remember that the coasting trade is not included in these figures. The principal ports of the United Kingdom on the western coast are : Liverpool, Cardiff, Swansea, and Bristol. In the Channel : Plymouth, Southampton, Portsmouth, Newhaven, Folkestone, and Dover. On the east coast : Newcastle-on-Tyne, Hull, Goole, Harwich, Rochester, Queenborough, and London. Ofthe \u00a3719,000,000 sterling to which the exports and imports amount, three ports by themselves account for \u00a3496,500,000; these three are Liverpool, London, and Hud. We have already described London, with the Thames, its docks, its animation, and its extraordinary commercial activity. So it is needless to recapitulate all this. We will only recall the fact that the metropolis did business in 1882 to the amount of \u00a3241,000,000 sterling."], [189, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 177 Liverpool is the capital of the north of England, the second town in the kingdom, and, after London, the most important port in Great Britain. The history of Liverpool does not go back very far; it existed, certainly, in the 12th century as a small vdlage of the name, but of so little importance was it that it does not figure on the map of England published in 1635; when, that same year, Charles I. levied a contribution for war purposes, Liverpool was put down at \u00a350, while Bristol paid no less than \u00a31,000. Up to the 18th century the port, access to which was difficult and dangerous, was only visited by a few coasting vessels. In 1709 a smad vessel sailed from Liverpool to Africa, where it embarked a cargo of negroes, who were transported to America. The profits of this expedition were so great that the slave trade soon became the principal business of the port, and in less than fifty years 100 ships were engaged in this traffic \u2014 as lucrative as it was inhuman. This was the origin of the prosperity and wealth of this important city. To the traffic in negroes were added the exportation of woollen goods from Manchester, and the importation of rum and sugar from America. Leaving Liver pool laden with British mer chandise, the vessels exchanged it on the African coast for a cargo of negroes, who were carried to America, where the human freight in its turn gave place to sugar and rum. The abolition of the slave trade did not ruin Liverpool, as the adversaries of Clarkson and Roscoe pretended. The ship- TOWN HALL (LIVERPOOL). owners sought another channel, and developed their commerce with North America \u2014 a trade which has since become the chief source of the wealth of Liverpool. The town is situated at the mouth and on the right bank of the Mersey, four miles from the sea, at the narrowest part of the estuary, the width of which is only three quarters of a mile between Liverpool and Birkenhead ; but extends both up and down stream, forming in the interior a vast lake, four miles wide and twelve long. Liverpool is built somewhat in semi-circular form, the river being the chord of the arc. The banks of the Mersey, for about six miles, are occupied by the docks, whicli may be reckoned amongst the most curious objects in the world. Long, wide streets radiate towards the centre of the city, intersected at intervals by smaller streets. In those nearest the docks are situated the offices of the principal shippers and merchants."], [190, "THE PROVINCES. 178 The immense houses, the banks, and particularly the palatial edifices erected by the insurance companies, give to Liverpool a monumental aspect quite as imposing as that of the new streets in the city of London. All that portion of Liverpool which extends beteewn the Mersey and Lime Street is the head- quarters of business. A busy, cosmopolitan, polyglot, motley, ever-changing crowd surges over the quays. We hear every language under the sun, while at the same time there defile before the bewildered spectator the most varied types of humanity, in the most fantastic costumes. Everyone rushes hither and thither, apostrophising, abusing one another, shoving and buffeting each other. The passing of the tramcars and of heavily-laden waggons cause sudden dispersions in this sea of humanity, similar to the waves thrown up by the prow of a vessel at speed, which close again behind the ship, agitated and surging. By degrees, as we ascend towards Lime Street, the offices and shops are replaced by dwelling-houses occupied by the rich merchants who have not yet deserted the city for the suburbs. The very wealthy prefer to live at the sea-side or on the banks of the Mersey. Others cross the river, morning and evening, from and to their homes in Cheshire on the opposite bank, where from Eastham to New Brighton the coast is covered with those charming cottage residences so dear to English people. Opposite Liverpool, on the left bank, stands the borough of Birkenhead, which is in the same relation to Liverpool as Southwark is to London \u2014 a suburb. Numerous steam-ferries leaving at ten minutes' intervals, place the two towns in communication, and add to the encumbrances of a river which, after the Thames, is the most animated in the world. Besides, a tunnel is now pierced under the Mersey, and permits the merchants of Liverpool to pass backwards and forwards, to and from business, without any risk of sea-sickness. The North- Western Railway Company now run trains through their tunnel direct to Liverpool. The passage under the river may be made every five minutes. The ferries used to transport every year from one bank to the other 26,000,000 of passengers; so it is easy to imagine what a boon the tunnel is which unites the 800,000 inhabitants of Liverpool with the 120,000 inhabitants of Birkenhead. As a rule, the houses and streets are modern, the old quarters having been pulled down and entirely rebudt. Nevertheless, we meet with courts in which are miserable hovels, dignified by the name of cottages, which serve as dwellings of the working classes, whose morality leaves a great deal to be desired. This is characteristic of most sea-port towns, where the assembly of sailors from all parts of the world detract somewhat from good morals, although they aid powerfully in increasing the population. Few towns have in this respect made more rapid progress than Liverpool, which, having had in the year 1700 only 5,800 inhabitants, a century afterwards numbered 75,000, and is now rapidly approaching 1,000,000 souls. As we proceed along certain streets, such as Lord Street and Bold Street, which are lined with elegant shops, we perceive at once that we are in a wealthy city. That is plain enough. The linen-drapers' establishments, which, not contented to display the Parisian fashions and elegant modes, assume even the titles of the Paris warehouses, and call themselves \"Bon Marche\" (almost always with the grave accent), are filled with a profusion of costumes and head-gear in the latest Paris fashions. The goldsmiths and jewellers, which have made Church Street a Rue de la Paix, dazzle the passers-by"], [191, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 179 with the glitter of precious stones and the gleaming plate which they expose for sale in their windows, whereat the loungers station themselves. All this indicates considerable wealth. The majority of these merchants are prosperous ; some are very rich. One of them, Mr. Joseph Mayer, a goldsmith by trade and a collector by taste, has bestowed upon the town a gallery of ancient objects of art, which are valued at \u00a32,500,000. As at Manchester, there are no squares or public gardens in the interior of the EXCHANGE (LIVERPOOL). town ; the parks are at a great distance from the centre of the city. A fine avenue planted with trees, Prince's Road, leads to Prince's Park and Sefton Park at the south side ofthe town. If Liverpool has no squares, it possesses, on the other hand, many remarkable monuments, some of which merit special description. The principal of these enclose the fine open space which is in the centre of the town, and where is situate the terminus of the London and North-Western Railway ; so when the tourist arrives from London he experiences a very favourable impression. In the midst of this space St. George's Hall, the most beautiful budding in Liverpool, first attracts our attention. It is a vast edifice of the Corinthian order, 51"], [192, "THE PROVINCES. 180 consisting of a central building flanked by two smader wings ; the situation of the whole upon a rising ground enhancing still more the effect of its imposing proportions. The principal front facing the Lime Street Railway Station is 378 feet in length. The great hall, which we enter through a lobby, is a majestic apartment of 153 feet in length, 63 in width, and 69 in height. The vaulted ceiling in sunken panels is supported by beautiful porphyry columns. The Liverpudlians are proud of their splendid organ which stands at the end of the great hall, and which cost \u00a310,000. Twice a-week, on Thursdays at 8, and on Saturdays at 3 p.m., popular concerts are given in this Hall, where 2,000 people can be accommodated. These concerts are very well attended. The two wings of the building contain the Courts in which the assizes are held. St. George's Hall was built in 1854, after the designs of Mr. Elmes, and cost more than \u00a3400,000 sterling. There are many statues in St. George's Square, and we remark two in particular in bronze, representing the Queen and the Prince Consort on horseback, and four lions in Scotch granite, modelled by Landseer. On the other side of the square are three other monuments : these are Brown's Free Library, the Walker Art Gallery, and the Picton Reading Room. The general appearance of these buildings is of no ordinary kind. The library was built at the cost of Sir William Brown, a very wealthy merchant, who presented it to the city. As the reading-room had become too small the municipality built the Picton Reading Room as an annexe on the plan of that of the British Museum. It is about 90 feet in diameter. The Walker Art Gallery, which is a counterpart of the library, is built in the same style, but of a more ornamental character. It was presented to the city by a rich brewer, Sir A. B. Walker, formerly Mayor of Liverpool, who expended \u00a322,000 upon it. Though only opened in 1877, this gallery already contains a considerable number of important works. An annual fine-art exhibition is held from the 1st September to the end of December. In 1882 there were nearly 3,000 works exhibited there. Close to the Walker Gallery, at the angle of the London Road, stands the monument to the Duke of Wellington, which consists of a Doric column, 75 feet high, surmounted by a bronze statue of the illustrious warrior. The other monuments belong chiefly to the utilitarian order, and are found in the district extending between St. George's Square and the docks. Tbe first we meet as we descend Duke Street is the edifice which contains the civic offices\u2014 Municipal Buildings. Behind this is a large building looking on Victoria Street, in which is the County Court. Continuing his walk, the tourist will soon reach the Town Hall, an elegant building in classic style, erected in 1749 after designs of the architect Wood, and partly rebuilt in 1795 after a fire. A wide entrance hall leads us to the grand staircase, which conducts us to the upper floors. On the first floor is the banqueting hall. The dinners given by the Mayor of Liverpool have some reputation, and the hospitality of the municipality is proverbial. It is related of a worthy Mayor that, delighted with the presence of a Royal Prince at one of his banquets, and observing him do honour to the repast, he cried out, \" Eat away, your Royal Highness, eat away ; there's plenty more in the kitchen ! \" Behind the Town Hall is the Exchange, an imposing building, the centre of which"], [193, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 181 is occupied by a fine well-lighted hall, called the News Room, to which only subscribers are admitted, though they have the privilege of introducing strangers. In the open space round the Exchange we find the Nelson monument by Westmacott, which is rather remarkable. Certainly with respect to public statues, Liverpool stands in the front rank of provincial towns. Castle Street, which extends in front of the Town Hall, leads direct to Canning LIVERPOOL (FROM THE MERSEY). \u25a0 Place, the centre of which is occupied by a vast building, in which are the Customs, the Post, and the Inland Revenue offices, but which is generally known as the Custom House. Then we find ourselves in the wide thoroughfare which runs parallel to the Mersey and alongside the docks. The Mersey, which divides the county of Lancaster from Cheshire, is rather a gulf than a river ; for the tributary streams are certainly not sufficient to supply this kind of inland sea, which has taken the name of a small water-course. The port of Liverpool, from an administrative point of view, extends from the mouth of the Dee to that of the Bibble, and consequently embraces both banks of the Mersey. By an Act of Parliament of 1 859 a council, called the Mersey Dock and Harbour Board, was constituted, which is charged with the supervision and administration of the docks of Liverpool and"], [194, "THE PROVINCES. 182 Birkenhead, and with the care of the ports. This Board is composed of twenty-eight members, of whom four are nominated by the Board of Trade ; the other twenty-four are elected by the dock ratepayers, that is to say, by the merchants and commercial men who possess dock premises. The duties of the Board are absolutely gratuitous, and are far from being sinecures, for the members meet five times a-week ; and it is by no means a trifle to manage these twenty-seven docks, into which more than 17,000 vessels enter annually, the aggregate tonnage being 7,800,000 tons. If we add up the number of vessels that entered and cleared during the year 1882, we find the total exceeds 34,000 vessels, and the tonnage 15,000,000. A hundred years ago all the commerce in Liverpool did not employ 100,000 tons; in 1840 there were only about two millions of tons of transport employed ; and we see to what this has extended in the year of grace, 1882 ! Is it not surprising to see the prodigious development of English commerce thus manifesting itself throughout the length and breadth of the country, and marching at an even pace amid all branches of business ? What elasticity I What resources ! What vitality ! As is the case in London, the exports are inferior to the imports. The latter, in 1882, reached the value of \u00a3112,334,000 sterling, against \u00a3102,000,000 only of the former. The imports, chiefly from America, consist principally of cottons, cereals, hides, provisions, fruits, and tobacco. The exports are cotton goods, woollens, metals, machinery, clothing, hats, and innumerable quantities of various industrial products. Nine-tenths of all this cotton imported by England arrives in Liverpool, which is the great market for the raw material as Manchester is that for the manufactured article. AU Lancashire comes thither to be supplied. There were imported, in 1882, 700,000 tons, which came almost exclusively from America, whence wrere also sent 1,550,000 tons of cereals and farinaceous foods; 14,850,000 gallons of petroleum, 100,000 tons of salted foods, 154,000 dozen of eggs, 46,000 head of cattle, and 86,000 sheep, and more than 19,800,000 lbs. of tobacco. Let us finish our rough notes upon the business of this port by stating that the customs duties in the same year amounted to \u00a33,096,000 sterling. As regards the capacity, if not the number of its ships, Liverpool is the greatest port in the world. To it belong 2,543 vessels of 1,704,000 tons burthen. Of these 1,793 are sailing vessels, and 750 steamers; 801 are of more than 1,000 tons; and amongst the steamships there are thirty-five whose register is between 2,500 and 3,000 tons, and thirteen of more than 3,000 tons. Besides its enormous traffic in merchandise, Liverpool is the principal port for the embarkation and disembarkation of travellers for and from America. The magnificent steamers of the White Star, Cunard, Guion, Inman, National, and Allan Lines, which perform the service between the United States and Liverpool, are veritable floating palaces which no one ought to omit to see when in Liverpool. Not a day passes without witnessing the departure of one of these superb steamers for New York, and it is most interesting to watch the departure of a crack steamer, such as the Britannic or the Germanic of the White Star Company. Admirably officered, these vessels accomplish the voyage with perfect regularity and punctuality. In these respects the White Star Line is unrivalled; the thirteen steamers which compose its fleet are all of modern build (the oldest is only fourteen years of age), and realise the most perfect type of the"], [195, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 183 Atlantic liner, for they unite speed, comfort, and security, without which attributes even the smartest vessel is worth nothing. The average duration of the passages of the White Star steamers between Queenstown and New York is nine days, eight hours; and between New York and Queenstown (eastward) eight days, fifteen hours. The two fastest ships, the Britannic, and her sister ship, the Germanic, steam fourteen to fifteen knots an hour, while the slowest of all makes over thirteen knots easily. Some vessels of other companies, it is true, have been mentioned as performing \u25a0 the transit more quickly; but these, like a certain boat in the channel ser- vice between Calais and Dover, and in which no one is ever ill, because she only crosses in fineweather, only make the passage in the summer, and remain in dock half the year. Everything in them is sacrificed to speed. In the White Star liners, on the contrary, nothing has been neglected to enable them to FLOATING QUAY (LIVERPOOL). brave all weathers. As good sailing vessels as steamers, they can, should necessity arise, dispense with steam-power, and cross the Atlantic under sail. This actually occurred during the winter of 1 883 to the Celtic \u2014 names ending in \"ic \" distinguish the White Star steamers \u2014 which, twenty-four hours after leaving New York, was disabled by the breaking of her screw-shaft. Notwith standing contrary winds and heavy weather, she arrived in Liverpool after a voyage of about a month, without having experienced the least injury. The officers \u2014 excellent seamen \u2014 are selected from the ships' companies, and gain their promotion in regular rotation. None of them belong to the Royal Navy, but sometimes the Government recruits the Inspectors of the Board of Trade from amongst them. These details sufficiently explain the popularity of these steamers, which carry every year 40,000"], [196, "THE PROVINCES. 184 passengers from America to Europe, and vice versa; more than 15,000 sacks of mails, and 200,000 tons of merchandise. With perfect courtesy, the directors of the White Star Line make no difficulty in granting permission to strangers to inspect their fine ships, of which they are justly proud. A brief description of the Britannic, which has made nearly a hundred voyages, will give an idea of what the steamers are like. On deck, order and cleanliness are absolute. In the centre, or nearly in the centre of the deck, is the bridge where the commander stands. The captain transmits his orders to the helmsman and to the engineer by an automatic telegraphic arrangement ; two dials placed in full view inform him that his orders have been received, understood, and executed. The engines and boilers occupy a space of about 100 feet long, and are of 5,400 horse-power (actual). They were built by Messrs. Maudslay, Sons, & Field, of London, the celebrated engineers who furnish engines to the navies of all foreign States in Europe, and amongst others those for the Italian Leviathans, the Dandolo, the Ruggiero di Lauria, and the Andrea Doria. Three dangers are to be feared at sea \u2014 water, fire, and collision. To provide against these, the Britannic is divided into seven water-tight and fire-proof compartments. When a leak is observed, the automatic doors and iron shutters, hidden in the thickness of the bulkheads, isolate the portion affected. In case of fire, the same means are applied, while powerful pumps, worked by steam, deluge the compartment with water, saturated with carbonic acid. We descend into the saloon and the cabins situated amidships by a fine staircase, which many hotels would envy. The saloon occupies the whole width of the ship ; it is 48 feet long and 38 feet wide. The floor is of variously coloured wood, and the sides are panelled in maple with white and gold borders. A real marble chimney-piece faces a well furnished bookcase, so passengers can while away the time by reading the principal English and American works. Commodious sofas, and easy chairs on pivots, are set around the tables, at which 200 persons can be seated comfortably, and enjoy the delicate meals prepared for them by a chef who is an artiste of the first order. The ladies' cabin, elegantly furnished, is a marvel of comfort ; and, so that there can be no jealousy, a smoking room has been provided for the sterner sex, furnished in a manner which is the acme of comfort to a smoker. Adjoining the grand saloon is a hair-dresser's establishment, in which a tiny steam engine provides the \" brushing by machinery.\" People are not yet shaved by steam, but that will come \u2014 it is inevitable ! Below are the bath rooms, and farther away the nursery in which the young children are strictly under the eyes of their governesses. Those who have travelled with children wdl understand what solicitude for the comfort of passengers this arrangement displays. Better still, so that the little ones shall not interfere with their elders, the chddren's dinner is served an hour before the seniors sit down. As for the cabins, they are as spacious as become such a vessel, kept scrupulously clean, well lighted, and wed ventilated. The passengers have only to touch an electric button to summon the stewards who are appointed to wait on them. As regards the navigation, all the steamers of the company follow the routes"], [197, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 185 recommended by Lieutenant Maury, which lengthens the passage by 100 miles, but greatly diminishes the risk of collision. We carry away with us from our inspection of an Atlantic liner a profound admiration for British maritime enterprise. In an old piece at the Cirque in Paris, one of the characters in the play used to exclaim every few moments, with the conventional English theatrical accent -.\u2014<< England is the first nation in the world ! \" ST. GEORGE'S DOCK (LIVERPOOL). That is a question which we need not discuss here, but it is very evident that after having seen London and Liverpool, one cannot help repeating : \u2014 \" Decidedly the English are the very best navigators in the world ! \" From Liverpool emigrants proceed to the United States and Canada. Of the 279,366 individuals of British nationality who expatriated themselves in 1882, 234,232 sailed from that port; 189,000 chose the United States as their destination: 40,000 selected Canada. English emigrants are the most numerous \u2014 they are in the proportion of 58 per cent. ; then come the Irish, 30 per cent. ; lastly, the Scotch, 12 per cent. Thirty years ago the exact contrary obtained ; the Irish furnished 60 per cent., the English 30 per cent, only of the total number. Merchandise or passengers, all pass through the docks, which are the centre of constant movement from six o'clock in the morning until midnight, and particularly"], [198, "THE PROVINCES. 186 between the hours of ten and four. To ascertain this we have only to walk along one of the fine terraces\u2014 or parades, as they are called\u2014 which are situated between the river and the docks, and whence a magnificent view of the Mersey, Birkenhead, and the Cheshire coast, can be obtained. The most beautiful is the Prince's Parade, 700 yards long and 10 yards wide, and at the extremities of which are shelters, in which pedestrians can take refuge from rain or bad weather. By this parade we reach the Prince's Landing Stage\u2014 a large floating quay, 660 yards long. This magnificent pier is supported by seven floating bridges, which rise and fall with the tide, and many SALTHOUSE DOCK (LIVERPOOL). of which are covered. Some buildings on this floating quay serve as waiting rooms, refreshment rooms, and offices for the various steam-boat companies ; one is a police station. A wide bridge gives access to carriages. The great Transatlantic steamers, and those for Scotland and Ireland embark and disembark their passengers at the Prince's Landing Stage, which js the most favourable place from which to judge of the business of the port. The extreme southern part of the landing stage is reserved for the steam ferry-boats, which ply between Liverpool and the various places on the opposite coast. From the centre of this stage the prospect embraces all the Mersey, ploughed by myriads of vessels of all kinds and of all nations : heavy sailing ships, graceful steamers with slim bows and raking masts, thick-set and short tug-boats, whose powerful engines make a deafening noise ; swift ferry-boats, which pass between Lancashire and Cheshire, threading their way amid a crowd of boats which encumber the river; small rowing boats, which alternately appear and disappear on and between the enormous waves ; lastly, all those little skiffs, which look like the small change of the enormous vessels of 1,000 and 3,000 tons, which cover the waters of the Mersey."], [199, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 187 Opposite, and rather to the left, is Birkenhead, with its docks and quays, like a reduced copy of Liverpool, or Liverpool seen through the larger end of an opera glass. To the right are Seacombe and Egremont, and farther still, New Brighton. At night the scene is fairy-like. The vessels at anchor carry a white light at the mast-head, while the ferries glide from side to side of the river, showing alternately red and green lights- In the distance the gas-lamps of Birkenhead and the villages on the coast, guard, with a luminous rampart, the Cheshire side of the river. Quite away on the right is the lighthouse of Rock Perch, a revolving light, which blazes out, and disappears again every moment. \" What patience those sailors must have,\" said a young lady belonging ST. PETER'S CHURCH (LIVERPOOL). to the world oil Von ennuie les autres as she gazed at the lighthouse ; \" since I have been here the light has gone out ten times, and they have relighted it every time ! \" To visit all the docks would be a Herculean task, and would occupy many days. The total extent of these establishments is 1,017 acres, of which about 250 acres are occupied by the basins, the rest by the warehouses. The quays are thirty-eight mdes long. Birkenhead, which is advancing rapidly in the footsteps of her elder sister, has already 500 acres of docks, and they are continually being added to. The public can circulate freely in the docks, but access to the warehouses and storehouses is only permitted to those having passes. It is a very good plan, whde travelling, to remember the American axiom : \" Keep going ahead and straight on until you are stopped; \" that is the way to see what you want. Starting from the neighbourhood of the Custom House, the first important dock is King's Dock, wherein is stored tobacco \u2014each dock has its speciality here. In these enormous magazines are stored about 39,400,000 lbs. of this weed, of which every Englishman consumes about 22 ozs. 52"], [200, "THE PROVINCES. 188 annually, which is, on the average, about one half more than in 1843, when no gentleman smoked a pipe in the street, and when the consumption only averaged about 14 oz. per head, per annum. Alongside the Salthouse and the Albert Docks are worth notice; the former, because it is now the oldest-it dates from 1 753 -and the latter, because of its immense warehouses which receive the merchandise imported from the Indies, China, and South America. The Prince's Dock claims the attention of the visitor, because there the great trans atlantic steamers are laid up, and we can inspect them by giving a little \"tip\" to the steward. , . . , The Waterloo Docks have the speciality of the American cereals which are stored in the enormous buildings which fill up three sides of it, and can accommodate 52,000 tons of grain. The grain is discharged by means of enor mous Armstrong steam cranes, and pass direct from the vessels' sides to the different floors of the warehouses by an ingenious system of endless bands and metal cylinders. Going on from thence, the best thing to do is to take the tramway which runs through the street, or the streets that are parallel to the docks, and proceed to the Canada Docks, whither come all the timber ships from North America, PRINCE'S PARK (LIVERPOOL). Mexico, and Scandinavia. The quays are more than half a mile long; and the basins, covering a superficies of twenty acres, communicate with the river by sluice-gates ninety feet wide. These form, with the Huskisson Dock, what are called the New North Docks ; and are of colossal proportions, inferior, nevertheless, to those of Langton Dock, and far less than the Alexandra Dock opened in 1881, and which is the largest of ad. This last numed dock is so extensive that twenty-two of the largest transatlantic steamers can lie alongside its quays to load or to discharge their cargoes. Although Liverpool is not actually a manufacturing town, it contains a certain number of important factories, workshops, and foundries. Shipbuilding is one of the chief local industries, and the vessels budt on the Mersey have a well-merited reputation. The yards of the Messrs. Laird \u2014 one of the first establishments in England \u2014 and those of the Mersey Iron and Steel Works, are the most important. In 1882, there were launched from the Mersey building yards twenty vessels : twelve sailing ships and eight steamers, of a total burthen of 30,000 tons.

To judge from the number of religious edifices belonging to Dissenters and Roman Catholics, without reckoning the synagogues and the churches consecrated to the Greek Schismatics, the Protestants of the Church of England are in a minority; for out ofthe 176 religious edifices in the town, only 66 own the bishop's sway. As monuments, these edifices are below mediocrity, with"], [202, "190 THE PROVINCES. the exception of St. Nicholas' Church, the oldest, and St. Peter's, the parish church, they are not worthy our attention. On the other hand, the Synagogue and the Greek Church, situated in Prince's Park Road, are modern buildings of good appearance, and very richly decorated. The charitable institutions, hospitals, and others, are numerous and well managed. Charity is extensively practised in England ; if we consider that all these institutions, without any exception, are kept up by the liberality of the well-to-do, and that the State does not contribute one farthing to their maintenance, we shad arrive at the secret of the veneration and respect which surround the rich and noble, who generously disburse a large portion of their incomes to relieve the misery of the labouring classes. Two establishments of this kind are remarkable. One is the Seamen's Orphanage, in which 350 orphans are received, brought up, and taught a trade ; the other is the Sailors' Home, where they can lodge cheaply, and out of the influence of the Sirens of the Port, whose charms are all-powerful with Jack Tar when he comes ashore after a long voyage. This establishment, every year, receives 6,000 or 7,000 sailors. The Savings Bank attached to the Home is the depository of about \u00a320,000, more advantageously employed thus, than if it had fallen into the laps of the Danae of the streets. The Sailors' Home, built in the Elizabethan style, is situated near the Custom House ; it is a very striking edifice. Amongst the educational establishments with which Liverpool is abundantly pro vided, we must mention the Liverpool College or Institute, the College for Girls, the Royal Institution Schools, the schools speciady for orphans, for the blind, for the deaf and dumb, industrial schools, and others. Liverpool supports nine daily papers, for the most part ably edited. The principal are the Liverpool Albion, the Liverpool Daily Post, the Liverpool Mercury, and, for business news, the Liverpool Journal of Commerce. The Albion, which costs only a half penny, is of the usual size, and publishes four editions daily between mid-day and five o'clock. The Daily Post, whose circulation is 40,000, is the most read. A dozen other (weekly) journals appear on Wednesdays and Sundays. With respect to theatres aud concerts, the Liverpudlians are very well off, for they have six large theatres and a considerable number of music halls, concert halls, skating rinks, and various exhibitions ; principally frequented by sailors, who are great pleasure-lovers. When the weather permits, the inhabitants go and breathe the fresh air in the six parks, which are situated in the environs. The two most beautiful are Sefton Park and Prince's Park. The latter was presented to the town by Mr. Yates, who paid \u00a348,000 for it. Liverpool is in direct communication with all parts of England. A great number of lines converge into its three large termini. That in Lime Street belongs to the London and North Western Railway, one of the four lines which connect London with the Mersey port. The station is faced by a fine hotel belonging to the railway company, arranged with every comfort and luxury, and one of the finest in Liverpool, where hotels are numerous and generally very well managed. The Great Northern, the Midland, and the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire"], [203, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 191 Railways put Liverpool in direct communication with London, Scotland, the midland counties, and the manufacturing districts of Yorkshire. The terminus of the Great Western Railway was at Birkenhead, on the opposite side of the Mersey; but now the tunnel is finished, the trains run direct into Liverpool, which is by it connected with the western counties and the coal fields of Wales. The canals, which have lost much of their importance since the establishment of railways, are not the less useful. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal, that which connects peel ;castle (isle of man). Liverpool with Manchester; the Bridgewater Canal, which connects the Mersey with Staffordshire, where the famous potteries are; and the Ellesmere Canal, which pene trates into North Wales, are the chief of these silent highways. It is in contemplation to cut a ship-canal between Liverpool and Manchester; with that and the Mersey Tunnel, nothing will be wanting to complete the happiness of the inhabitants. To explore the different quarters of the town, the tourist has the choice of cabs, omnibuses, or tramways. A propos of this last-mentioned mode of locomotion, so popular in France and England, it may not be undesirable to state that the first English tramways were started in Birkenhead. Every ten minutes a steam-boat leaves the Prince's landing-stage for Birkenhead, and in a few minutes the passengers are landed at Woodside. In a town which dates"], [204, "192 THE PROVINCES. Only from the beginning of this century, and which in 1800 had not 100 inhabitants, which was only built as an annexe to Liverpool, and which is primarily a commercial depot, there are, it is needless to say, docks, which are the principal, and, indeed, the sole local curiosity. These are managed, like those in Liverpool, by the Mersey Dock and Harbour Board, and are chiefly remarkable for the two immense basins, one of fifty acres and the other of sixty acres in extent, which are surrounded by immense warehouses, built on the model of those in St. Katharine's Docks, in London. Ad the coal forwarded from Wales to the Mersey is deposited in the Birkenhead Docks ; but now that the tunnel is open, it is to be feared that Birkenhead will lose something of its importance. The five churches of Birkenhead, its schools, its hospitals, its library, and its theatre, cannot be considered interesting monuments from any point of view ; but Claughton Park, situated to the north-west of the town, will repay a visit. Well planted, and possessing pretty artificial lakes, which wind through wide grass-plots and flower-beds, Birkenhead Park presents a charm ing scene. In summer, tourists should proceed as far as New Brighton, the suburban retreat of the Liverpudlians \u2014 an assemblage of villas and houses, built upon a nice, sandy beach, where from those who are not afraid of a roughish sea can bathe in its waters somewhat muddy withal. The southern portion of Lancashire, as we have seen, is somewhat flat and monotonous. The suburbs of Liverpool have no great charm ; so there are comparatively few excursions to be made except along the sea-coast and the borders of the river. But there is on the Irish Sea, at equal distances from England, Scotland, and Ireland, a small island, very curious and GLEN HELEN (ISLE OF MAN). very picturesque; we mean the Isle of Man,"], [205, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 193 This island, which measures thirty-two miles by ten, is divided into two portions, lengthwise, by a chain of hills which crosses it from north-east to south-west. Of these hills the highest is about 2,000 feet; down their sides run many streams, which fertilise the land and water the pretty valleys. The inhabitants are of Celtic origin, descended from the primitive races of Great Britain. First a Danish colony, like Ireland, the Isle of Man, conquered by the Scotch in the 13th century, passed, in the following century, and after many vicissitudes, into the possession of the Earls of Derby. In the RAMSAY (ISLE OF MAN). 18th century it became, by heritage, the property of the Dukes of Athol, who sold to the Government, for a sum of \u00a32,000, the sovereign rights of the island, but retained seignorial and territorial rights. As the island is rich in minerals, it was a good property. The Athol family retained it until 1825, when the then Duke sold it to the Crown for the round sum of \u00a3400,000. So the Isle of Man has been an appendage of the British Crown for sixty years. It nevertheless preserves its independent form of government, its laws and judicial organization. The island is ruled by a Lieutenant-Governor, and the laws are made by the Upper and Lower Chambers. The latter is called the House of Keys. The principal town is Douglas, which is in direct communication with Liverpool by means of a regular service of steamers; but Castletown is the capital of the island. Douglas is relatively a modern town, the new portions of which situated on the cliffs, are invaded in summer by a crowd of bathers, attracted from the northern counties"], [206, "XHE PROVINCES. 194 by the agreeable climate and charming situation of Douglas, which has become a bathing station of some importance. Seen from the sea, the town, backed by hills, and built in semi-circular form, on the shore of a beautiful bay, presents a very charming picture. The Isle of Man, considered by geologists as a fragment of the Lake District, really recals the features of that region. There are the same geological characteristics, the same mountains, with waterfalls and pretty-wooded heights. The Isle of Man \u2014 who will believe it ? \u2014 has a railway connecting Douglas with Castletown and Peel. The second of these two towns offers nothing of interest, but Peel still possesses the ruins of its ancient castle and of its cathedral, which, fortified and embattled, formed part of the defences of the town. The northern portion of the island has no railway, and the road along the coast traverses the copper and zinc mining districts, of which the richest and most abundant are those of Laxey. These mines, with the herring fishery, constitute the wealth of the Isle of Man, whose picturesque localities and the manners and customs of the inhabitants, render it one of the most curious places in the British Isles, which contain so many surprises for the investigator and for the tourist."], [207, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 195 II.

Between Liverpool and the Bristol Channel the coast of England, or rather of Wales, possesses only ports of little consequence. As soon as we have passed the Dee, Cheshire, the Isle of Anglesey, and the end of Carnarvonshire, we enter the beautiful CLIFTON SUSPENSION BRIDGE. Cardigan Bay, which, if it contains no harbours of importance, is plentifully dotted with towns and picturesque villages. It is here, actually on the coast, or at a small distance from it, that we see Harlech and its old castle ; and Barmouth, with its sandy beach, very much frequented during the bathing season. Here is Aberystwith, the Brighton of Wales, whose cliffs are dominated by the ruins of a castle built in the Middle Ages ; then come Fishguard and Cardigan ; lastly, as soon as we have rounded St. David's Head, we reach the mouth of the immense estuary, at the side of which, on the Avon, Bristol is situated. Between Liverpool and Bristol, the simplest, the most rapid, and most agreeable means of communication is the railway. When the Severn Tunnel is in working order, direct communication between Liverpool and Bristol will be established. 53"], [208, "THE PROVINCES. 196 Bristol, a very ancient town, whose foundation has been attributed to Brennus, was first called/ by the Saxons, Bright Stow\u2014 a name corrupted to Bristowe, Latinized to Bristollum', and finally transformed to Bristol. Situated at the confluence of the Avon and the Frome, seven miles from the sea, with which it is connected by the Avon and the Bristol Channel, this town was destined to become a port of considerable import ance; so for a long time it was considered as the most extensive port in England, London excepted. Up to the last century, Liverpool and Bristol disputed for the commercial supremacy BRISTOL CATHEDRAL of the West of England ; the struggle was long and obstinate, but Liverpool, situated on the vast Mersey, was bound to advance before Bristol, so ill at ease on the mud-banks of the Avon. After slowly declining for a long time Bristol has at length taken up a secondary position amongst the ports of the West of England. It is now a city of 207,000 inhabitants, picturesquely situated upon a hilly ground, and divided into two parts \u2014 the lower town and the upper town. The lower, the business quarter by the docks, is included between the two rivers. The narrow and tortuous streets are bordered with old corpulent gabled houses which overhang the pathway, giving to these old quarters the aspect of a Flemish City. It is said that certain wooden houses still standing were brought from Holland in pieces, which sounds reasonable enough. The upper town, comprising the old suburb of Clifton \u2014 now a part"], [209, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 197 of Bristol \u2014 is inhabited by merchants and well-to-do people, who have built some elegant houses there, after the style of those which are so numerous in the suburbs of London To reach Clifton, we must pass by Brandon Hill, an ascent which was at one time crowned by a fortification, and from whence a magnificent view of the town and the surrounding country may be obtained. Clifton, built upon a steep cliff, the base of which is washed by the Avon, which runs a hundred feet beneath, is united to the opposite bank by a magnificent suspension bridge, commenced in 1836 and finished in 1862, which cost about \u00a3100,000 sterling. The panorama which is unfolded to the spectator is of great beauty ; at the foot of the down rolls the Avon, and on the opposite side lies Nightingale Valley, bordered by heights, and covered with a luxuriant forest, named Leigh Woods. Apart from its churches, Bristol has no monu ments. The cathedral, situated near the port, is a Gothic building, the nave of which is modern ; the choir and transepts date from the 12th century. With its unfinished towers the cathedral presents but a mediocre appearance. The church of St. Mary's, RedclTff^^^^B situated a little distance from the ra i I-l way, in a somewhat low quarter, is miel of the most elegant Gothic churches nil this part of England. It was foundedl in the 13th century by the merchantl princes of Bristol. Its lofty spire of reasancL^ stone, 180 feet high, overlooks all the lower town. The harmony of its style, which obtains throughout, and the beauty of the sculpture with which it is decorated, stamp it certainly as the most beautiful ecclesiastical edifice in the city. Like Pisa, Bristol has its leaning tower, represented by BRISTOL PORT. the clock tower of the Templars' Church, recently restored within, but very dilapidated exteriorly, and surrounded by miserable hovels. The Bristolians have always had the reputation for prodigality and love of luxury, which, perhaps, were accounted for by the traditional want of beauty of the female population, who had recourse to art to supply the want of those gifts which nature has refused them. It is commerce which paid their foolish expenses \u2014 aud what commerce? Truth obliges us to say that it was the slave trade, of which the Bristol merchants made a speciality, and which returned them such large profits, that it was only with great reluctance, and after as much delay as possible, that they renounced it. Was it not"], [210, "THE PROVINCES. 198 against them that the singer Incledon, when hissed, launched this scathing apostrophe: \"^There is not a brick of your houses which is not cemented with the blood of a negro.\" ... ' It is to the suppression of this traffic, doubtless, that the decadence of Bristol is partlv attributable, and its merchants were obliged to seek in some other kind of speculation more honest profits. So it is to Bristol belongs the honour of having launched, in 1838, the first steamboat which crossed from England to America. It became the town which gave birth to Cabot, the celebrated navigator who discovered Newfoundland, and saw the coasts of Florida a year before Columbus did, to open a new route to English maritime commerce. The Great Western, built at Bristol, and which we now-a-days would look upon as a nut-shell, was then so enormous that it was necessary to enlarge the dock gates to permit her exit from the building yard. The docks at that time were only basins cut in the bed of the Frome and the Avon. The development of the commerce of Bristol, and the increased dimensions of the merchant vessels, necessitated the con struction of new docks at the mouth of the Avon, which are connected with Bristol by a special line, called the Bristol Port Extension Railway. These docks were opened for business in 1876. CIVIC CROSS (BRISTOL). Since 1848, the maritime commerce of Bristol has considerably extended. The imports particularly have vastly increased ; the exports, on the contrary, have markedly diminished. The principal articles imported are American cereals; in 1882, there were entered in this port 400,000 tons of grain and flour. But this is not all ; in the same year Bristol imported 550,000 gallons of petroleum, over 800,000 pounds of tobacco, and a large quantity of wine, spirits, and timber. The business of the port is, of course, considerable. The published reports of the Board of Trade inform us that the total tonnage of ships entering the port in 1846 was 100,722 tons; in 1870, it amounted to 348,556 tons; in 1875, 402,234 tons; and in 1882, 502,088 tons. So far as the Customs' receipts are concerned, Bristol is the fourth port in England, the duties of all kinds amounting to about \u00a3800,000 sterling, annually. As an industrial city, Bristol occupies a very honourable positiou, and contains numerous factories. The most important industries are those of glass, pottery, chemical products, tobacco, sugar, shoes, and soap. The boot and shoe trade employs about 5,000"], [211, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 199 workpeople, the soap works about 400. The Great Western Cotton Works employ 1,500 persons, and it is estimated that about 2,000 hands are employed in the making of HIGH STREET (BRISTOL). corsets, which forms an important branch of Bristolian commerce. Bristol, separated from Wales by the Severn, has to suffer for its position, which renders communication with the Welsh colliery districts somewhat difficult. The opening of the Severn tunnel, a gigantic enterprise, will put an end to this state of things. The work is just now finished, and would have been completed ere this, had it not been for an accident which happened in the summer of 1883, when the tunnel was inundated in consequence of a fissure in the roof. The fault was repaired, and the delay was not so considerable as at first was feared."], [212, "THE PROVINCES. 200 Before speaking of the other ports of the Bristol Channel, let us say a few words about Gloucester, which is about thirty-five miles from Bristol, a distance quickly accom plished by railway. Gloucester is a very ancient city, situated on the banks of the Severn in a large and fertile plain, bounded at a distance by picturesque hills, and is the centre of an important agri cultural district. I It owes to the Roman occupation the termination of its name and the arrange- ment of its principal streets, which, like those of Chester, start from a common centre towards the four cardinal points. The old quarters of the city, both curious and picturesque, preserve an ap- pearance peculiarly their own; the houses, lofty and of various styles of archi tecture, dating for the most part from the time of Queen Anne, are interesting from more than one point of view. But the monument par excellence, the \" lion \" of the place, is the beautiful cathedral dedicated to St. Peter, in which we find traces of Saxon, Norman, and English archi- tecture. This beautiful edifice, though not so extensive as some grand cathedrals, is never theless a magnificent specimen of the pointed architecture. Exteriorly, the most remark able part of the edifice is its lofty tower, topped by carved pinnacles, which are chiselled with admir able delicacy. The nave is closed at the east end by a superb stained glass window, which does not yield in richness and purity of style even to that of York Minster. The choir, recently restored, is in the Perpendicular style, and the Lady Chapel, built in the 15th century, contains a reredos which BARMOUTH AND HARLECH CASTLE. is a masterpiece of decorative art. The tombs, which embellish the interior of the cathedral, are numerous, and some of them remarkable ; the principal ones are those of Robert Courthose, the son of Wilham the Conqueror, and of Edward II. At the side of the nave is the cloister, a magnificent specimen of the national architecture, whose delicate mouldings and rich ornamentation constitute it a very gem."], [213, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 201 From Gloucester to Newport and Cardiff, the railroad passes near some celebrated localities. The most curious, unquestionably, is the town of Chepstow, picturesquely situated on the right bank of the Wye. It is dominated by the beautiful ruins of its celebrated castle, which overhang the river. This castle, which dates from the 13th century, stands on the summit of a steep hill, and encloses four courts forming as many lines of defence. About five miles from Chepstow are the beautiful ruins of Tintern Abbey, which belong, as does Chepstow Castle, to the Duke of Beaufort. The abbey is a magnificent monument of the ornate style, which succeeded to the primitive English GLOUCESTER CATHEDRAL. architecture, whose characteristic was, as its name indicates, profusion and beauty of decoration. The roof no longer exists, but the walls are standing, and the fragments of sculpture which are still visible give one a high opinion of the art displayed by the monks, who built this beautiful edifice. Newport, which is only seventeen miles from Chepstow, is a very flourishing place, situated on the right bank of the Usk, which is so far navigable and accessible by the largest ships. The docks, finished in 1875, are extensive and well arranged. As for the town, it is dirty and melancholy, and possesses no monument worthy of the name. Cardiff, on the contrary, is doubly interesting. It is, in the first place, a striking example of what can be accomplished by a man of large views, and of a bold and enterprising mind, for Cardiff has been solely created by the efforts of the Marquis of Bute, who, while increasing his own fortune enormously, has made that of the country ; besides, for those who wish to visit the coal districts of South Wales, it is an excellent centre whence it is easy to reach the principal coal-mines of that region."], [214, "THE PROVINCES. 202 The population of Cardiff was, in 1801, 1,018 inhabitants; in 1851, 18,000; and in 1883 there were 90,000 souls in it. These figures need no comment, and fully justify the foresight of the Marquis of Bute, to whom the town owes its existence and its prosperity. The Marquis of Bute, owner of nearly the whole of the Rhondda Valley, and of the mines of iron and coal which it contains, was struck with the difficulty experienced in the shipment of the products of the mines, and conceived the idea of excavating the Cardiff docks, which belong to him almost entirely. Full of confidence in the correctness of his views, he did not hesitate to risk his whole fortune in this vast enterprise. The success of this venture has exceeded all expectations, for Cardiff is now the principal port for the shipment of the coal and iron furnished by the whole of the district. In 1839, when the first docks were opened, more than 160,000 tons of coal were exported from Cardiff. Nine years afterwards the Marquis of Bute died, with the satis faction of knowing that his task which he had half accom plished would be continued by his executors, and that his son, then only a year old, would be one of the richest men in England. In 1859 it was found necessary to build new docks ; in 1864 the trustees asked Parliament for authority to expend \u00a31,200,000 to enlarge the harbour and the dock LLANDAFF CATHEDRAL. basins. But Lord Bute being a minor, the House of Commons refused to sanction this project, and they were obliged to modify the bold plans they had conceived. While the commerce of Cardiff continued to extend, houses sprang up like mushrooms ; the streets were continually being added to, and the population increased with such rapidity that in eighty years it had augmented nearly a hundredfold. Newcastle was superseded by Cardiff in the export of coal, for in 1882 the latter port despatched nearly 6,000,000 tons, as well as 150,000 tons of iron, the total value of which amounted to more than \u00a34,000,000 sterling. These two minerals are the chief exports of Cardiff, and are now valued at about \u00a34,440,000 sterling, while the imports do not reach more than \u00a32,000,000. Such an amount of business causes great activity in the port ; in that same year, 3,765 vessels entered the docks, and 5,929 cleared outwards, of which the greater part were colliers. When we have perambulated the extensive docks, alongside of which mountains of coal are ranged, and strolled through the streets of the town, which are neatly kept and bordered with houses of a very simple style, there only remains to be seen the castle,"], [215, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 203 the noble residence of the Marquis of Bute. It is situated at the end of the town, on the banks of the Taff, which is very shallow here, although only two miles from its mouth. Successive restorations have left little or nothing of the ancient edifice which dated TINTERN ABBEY. from the Norman period, but from a distance the embattled towers, the pinnacles, and the walls which surround it on three sides, present a very picturesque appearance. The castle is sumptuously furnished ; the summer and winter smoking rooms of the Marquis of Bute have a legendary reputation. 54"], [216, "THE PROVINCES. 204 Two miles awav, on the right bank of the Taff, stands Llandaff Cathedral, a monu ment of the 11th century, which was permitted to go to ruin, but which during the last fifty years has been skilfully restored. The viUage of Llandaff, which contains only 700 or 800 inhabitants, is nevertheless the seat of an Anglican bishopric. According to tradition, at Llandaff was erected the first Christian church in Great Britain. The cathedral, of earlv English Gothic, consists of a nave, two aisles, and a choir Ihe roof and the stained-glass windows are modem, as well as the spire, which is 195 feet high. Notwithstanding its curious position at the foot of the hill on which the village is built, contrary to all rules, perhaps even on this account, Llandaff Cathedral has an ex tremely picturesque appear ance. From Cardiff to Swansea the railroad strikes inland, passing Llantrissant, a horrible little town in a picturesque situation, the appearance of which is remarkable, but which it is as well to see from the outside and without entering it; then, by Bridgend, the rail turns towards the coast again and traverses the valleys of Afon and Neath, on its way to Swansea.

The smelting of the ores and the working of the copper are the chief industries VIEW OF TENBY AND HOYLF.'S MOUTH CAVERN. of Swansea and of the district, over which hangs continually a cloud of smoke and steam most unpleasant to the sight and smell, and very injurious into the bargain. The ore manufactured at Swansea does not come solely from Cornwall and Devonshire, but a little from everywhere ; Cuba, Valparaiso, and other places in South America, furnishing a considerable quantity of it. Swansea is beautifully situated at the end of an extensive semi-circular bay, forming a natural harbour, well sheltered from all winds, which serves as a port of refuge for hundreds of vessels at the same time. The town possesses no important buildings, and, with the exception of the docks,"], [217, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 205 there is nothing worth seeing. Even the docks, after those in Liverpool, for instance, have but a secondary interest. On the other hand, the environs are charming, and an excursion along the bay is HIGH STREET AND THE DOCKS (CARDIFF). one of the most agreeable trips that can be made. Before we reach the Mumbles, we perceive Oystermouth Castle, which overlooks the sea from the top of a picturesque rocky eminence. The beauty of Swansea Bay is enhanced by the luxurious vegetation, the leafy trees, and the verdure which meet one on every side, and which contrast so"], [218, "THE PROVINCES 206 pleasantly with the high smoky chimneys in the direction of the town. From Swansea the coast to Tenby is less interesting, although very picturesque. Tenby is situated on a rocky promontory, which stretches into the sea at the southern extremity of Carmarthen Bay. Thanks to its pleasant situation and to its climate, temperate in summer and mild in winter, this very old little town, which in the time of Henrv VIII. was an important commercial centre, has now become one of the most frequented watering-places of South Wales. Its only drawback is its great distance from London and other great towns. On the extreme point of the promontory are the ruins of an old castle, from which the view of the sea, the surrounding country, and the Bay of Carmarthen, is extremely beautiful. At some distance is an isolated rock, called St. Catherine's Rock, which is crowned by a battery. At low water we can walk across to the island of St. Catherine dry-shod. In the neighbourhood of Tenby, near the village of Lydstep, are some beautiful grottoes, which can only be visited at certain times, according to the state of the tide. About a dozen miles from Tenby is the town of Pembroke, which owes its prosperity to the Arsenal, established there by the Government in 1814. Pembroke is built on a promontory, extending into Milford Haven, and consists of one long thoroughfare, inter sected by smaller streets. It is a melancholy town, of very commonplace aspect, interesting chiefly because of the beauty of its surround ings, and from the ruins of its castle, which occupy the extremity of the headland, and whose walls are continually battered by the waves. Pembroke Castle, built in 1092, con sists of two enceintes, bristling with enormous towers. Henry VII. was born there in 1456, and the tourist is shown the room in which BT. CATHERINE'S GROTTO (TENBY). the event took place. From the centre of the castle rises the keep, a massive round tower, 75 feet high, and 163 in circumference. The walls are 17 feet thick at the base, and 14 at the summit. The exterior rampart is now covered with grass, and the walls and the towers are clothed with ivy. The dockyard, two miles from the town, encloses au extent of about 80 acres. It is surrounded by high walls, aud defended by a fort and two Martello towers. The establishment is complete. There are not less than a dozen covered slips for the building of vessels of ad classes. More than 2,000 workmen are employed there, and Pembroke is entered in the naval estimates for an annual sum of nearly \u00a3160,000. A steam ferry connects Pembroke with Milford, which is in a beautiful situa tion on the opposite side of the haven. Milford was founded in 1790, and the dockyard was first established there ; but when it was removed to Pembroke in"], [219, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 207 1814, Milford gradually lost its importance. For some years, however, the establishment of a regular service of steamers for Waterford and Cork has given it some little animation. This town has given its name to the magnificent roadstead of Milford Haven, which is unique in the world, and in which the entire British fleet could find shelter. Milford Haven extends about ten miles inland, and has an average width of a mile and a half. It is quite sheltered by the bare hills, which surround it on all sides like a vast amphi theatre. The whole of the southern coast of Pembrokeshire is very beautiful, and presents an aspect of high perpendicular cliffs, bristling with rocks of curious forms like those known as the Stock Rocks, natural pyramids which serve as resting-places for innu merable sea-birds. In certain places, as at St. Gowan's Head, deep ravines form terrible precipices of a wild and desolate appearance. These natural curiosities are the objects of many trips and excursions, which can easily be made from either Pembroke or Tenby. III. NEWCASTLE, COMMERCE AND ANIMATION OF THE PORT. THE YORKSHIRE COAST. \u2014 WATERING-PLACES. WHITBY. SCARBOROUGH. HULL THE THIRD PORT OF ENGLAND. \u2014 THE DOCKS. The Eastern ports are naturally less important than those of the west and south. Situated on the North Sea, opposite to Northern Europe, it is with Holland, Germany, Scandinavia, and Russia that they principally have dealings. As the commerce of England with these countries is not so considerable as that which it carries on with other parts of the globe, these ports are, from their very position, inferior to those on the western side. The principal ones are Newcastle, Shields, Hartlepool, Hull, the most important of all, Goole, Great Grimsby, and Harwich, scattered between the Tyne and the Thames. Whitby and Filey in Yorkshire, Yarmouth in Norfolk, and Lowestoft in Suffolk are rather fishing than commercial ports, Yarmouth in particular being the centre of the herring fishery, which from September till the end of December occupies the greater portion of the population . Proceeding along the coast from north to south, the first considerable port we come to is Newcastle. Newcastle-on-Tyne, to give it its true name, is a town containing 145,000 inhabitants, and situated on the left bank of the Tyne about ten miles from its mouth. It is placed on the side of a hill, upon which the houses are built in tiers, and dominated by its churches, and the old Norman keep ofthe castle. The aspect of this town, enveloped in the thick clouds of smoke poured forth from the numerous factory chimneys which surround it, is far from being agreeable ; and it is certainly not by its beauty that Newcastle recommends itself to the tourist. Its industrial and commercial importance,"], [220, "THE PROVINCES 208 and the animation which characterises its manufactures, have made it one of the most important towns in the north-eastern counties. Its position at a little distance from the sea, on the borders of Northumber land and Durham, separated only by the river, and at the point of intersection of numerous railways, which place it in com munication with all the manufacturing districts of the interior, is one of the most advantageous ; to this and to the enterpris ing spirit of its inhabitants it owes its prosperity and its renown. Newcastle is connected with the town of Gateshead, situated on the opposite bank, and conse- qucntly in the county of Durham, by two bridges, one of stone, and the other a magni ficent viaduct, which spans the valley of the Tyne 75 feet above it, and not less than 1,337 feet long. It was built by Robert Stephenson, and consists of two bridges, one above the other ; the upper bridge is NEWCASTLE CASTLE, reserved for the railroad, the lower one suspended from the other in a most daring manner, is used by carriages and pedestrians. The platform of the railroad bridge serves as a covering for the lower one, and gives it the appear ance of a long gallery. This magnificent bridge cost more than \u00a3480,000. Like all towns, whose rapid commercial development increases their extent, New castle is composed of two parts, the old town with its steep and narrow streets, called \"chares,\" and the modern town with its wide thoroughfares, bordered with fine stone houses and gay shops. The castle, which has given its name to the town (New ELSWICK PARK (NEWCASTLE),"], [221, "NEWCASTLE"], [222, "210 THE PROVINCES Castle), dates from the 12th century, and was one of the strongest forts on the Borders. It now serves as the Museum, and as a place of meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle. From the summit of the square tower, a kind of battlemented keep, about 84 feet high, of a gloomy and melancholy appearance, we may obtain a beautiful view of the town, and of the Tyne dotted by innumerable vessels, as well as of Gateshead, a suburb of Newcastle. The tower contains on the first story a Norman chapel, with semi circular arches, which contains some ancient tombs. The museum is on the second floor, in a vast vaulted gallery, supported by a central pillar. Here is displayed an interesting NEVILLE STREET (NEWCASTLE). collection of Roman and British antiquities, vases in bronze, g*ass, and earthenware, statuettes and Roman altars, of which the greater part has been dug up in the town and neighbourhood. The great hall is above the museum; it is 36 feet high, surrounded by galleries, and also contains many Roman antiquities. Charles I., while a prisoner with the Scots, lived here some time before being delivered to the Parliament; the room which he occupied is called the King's Chamber, but there is nothing remarkable about it. After the castle, the church of St. Nicholas is the most interesting monument in the town. Built in the 14th century, on the site of an ancient church, erected by Osmund the Good, Bishop of Salisbury, and nephew of William the Conqueror, it consists of a fine nave, paved with grave-stones, and surrounded by tombs, embellished with statues in the English fashion. We remark those of Collingwood, one of the heroes"], [223, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS 211 of Trafalgar, and of Sir M. Ridley, the eminent magistrate and benefactor of Newcastle. St. Nicholas' also boasts some beautiful stalls of carved wood, a picture by Tintoretto \" Christ washing His disciples' feet,\" and two beautiful stained glass windows ; one which adorns the north transept is modern. The most interesting portion of the church, from an arch\u00e6ological point of view, is the tower with its four flying buttresses, which support an elegant pointed clock tower, 90 feet high. The Town Hall and the Corn Market, quite modern buildings, are a little distance WHITBY. from the church. The Theatre, the Central Exchange, and the new Market, are situated in the modern part of the town, in which we also perceive a lofty column, surmounted by a statue of Lord Grey, by Baily. The lower town and the banks of the river are the business centre of the city. There factory chimneys rise high in the air like the masts of vessels without yards, from which escape multi-colored clouds of smoke that hang over the town, and through which the sun penetrates with difficulty. The air is laden with pestilential vapours from the chemical manufactories, which form one of the most important branches of the local industry. But the forges and foundries are really the speciality of Newcastle. The most celebrated establishment is that founded in 1824, by one of the most illustrious sons of Newcastle, George Stephenson, the eminent engineer, who, before Davy, invented a miners' safety lamp, and who revolutionised the world by the invention 55"], [224, "THE PROVINCES. 212 of the locomotive engine, perhaps the most marvedous of all the machines created by man. Stephenson's Iron Works still exist, and there we can follow the construction of the iron horse in ad its details, from the moment it is designed upon paper till the time it is placed upon the rails, ready to draw the long goods train, or to transport from one end of the kingdom to the other the loungers and the curious who, for the most part, forget the name of the poor working miner, whose genius did so much for the SCARBOROUGH. welfare of his fellow-men. The inhabitants of Newcastle have not been ungrateful towards the man to whom they owe, in a great measure, the prosperity of their country. They have raised to his memory, in one of the public places, a monu ment worthy of him. The statue of Stephenson, by Lough, is placed on a pedestal, adorned by four statues representing a miner, a mechanic, a journey man, and a blacksmith, his faithful and devoted assistants. industries, and employs a large number of hands in Newcastle and its neighbourhood. When iron was substituted for wood in the construction of ships, it was the Tyne which gave the initiative, and from one of its dockyards the first iron ship was launched in 1842. The competition between the railroad and sailing ships which carried the coal to London, necessitated a reform in the means of transport by sea. Then iron-screw colliers were built. The first was launched in 1850. In four hours it had taken in a cargo of 650 tons of coal; five days later it returned ready to receive another shipment. To accomplish the same work, it would have been necessary to have employed two sailing vessels, which would have occupied a month in doing it. At present, a collier manned by twenty-one hands makes"], [225, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 213 on an average fifty trips a year, carrying to London 60,000 tons of coals. It would occupy sixteen sailing vessels, and 150 hands to obtain the same result. Faster than they were twenty years ago, these vessels have been considerably improved, and the employment of water-ballast economises much time and expense every voyage. Every collier is built in water-tight compartments, in which it can carry the desired quantity of water ballast. As soon as one of these vessels has discharged SCARBOROUGH BEACH. its cargo, it immediately returns to Newcastle with its valves open. By the time it reaches the mouth of the Thames it is ballasted, and ready to encounter the waves. When it enters the Tyne the water is pumped out, and by the time it comes alongside the quay, it is ready to receive a new consignment. This arrangement is very ingenious and very simple. As a rule, the ships which are turned out from the Tyne yards are destined for the transport of merchandise. They are for the most part large ships of not great speed, but admirable sailers, and of proved solidity of construction. In 1882, there were built upon the Tyne 114 vessels, of which 107 were steamships, of a total capacity of 107,303 tons. One hundred and one were iron ships, three of steel, and only ten of wood. All were merchant vessels. But ships of wrar are also built there ; during the Crimean War an iron floating battery of 250 horse-power, and carrying thirty-six guns, was laid down,"], [226, "THE PROVINCES 214 launched, armed, and completely fitted out in three months and a-half. This tour de force shows the resources at the disposal of the shiobuilders of Newcastle, and the energy which they can bring to bear in emergencies. We must not. quit Newcastle without visiting the cannon foundry of Sir William BAMSDALE VALLEY (SCARBOROUGH). Armstrong, tbe inventor of the formidable guns which bear his name. This magnificent estab lishment, unique of its kind, which looks more like an arsenal than a private enterprise, is situated at Elswick, two miles from the town. Four thousand workmen are employed, and the machines which bore the enormous guns which are made there, are, in the opinion of competent persons, the most perfect ever invented. Newcastle is more interesting from the pacific and commercial point of view, than in its military aspect, and it is time that^ we should occupy ourselves with the various businesses which are carried on there. This is a less stirring subject, but quite as important, if not more so, than the other. Newcastle may be considered as the fourth port of England, so considerable are its transactions. Every year some 12,000 vessels of an aggregate burden of 5,500,000 tons, enter and leave the port. The imports, consisting principally of food commodities (particularly grain) and iron ore, reached the figure of \u00a37,650,000 sterling in 1882 ; the exports only \u00a34,597,000. The latter"], [227, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 215 included, besides coal, which is the principal commodity exported, iron and copper, in ores and manufactured, soda, glass, arms, and chemical products. The Customs duties in the same year only amounted to \u00a3372,000 sterling. This small total is explained by the fact that the raw materials and all articles of consumption pay no duty, tea and wine excepted, two commodities which Newcastle does not import. Whde descending the Tyne, which is in reality the port of Newcastle, we pass between two almost uninterrupted rows of quays, ship building yards, and factories, till A STREET IN SCARBOROUGH. we reach the mouth, where are situated the two small towns of North Shields on the left bank, and South Shields on the right bank, where it is said the lifeboat was invented by Mr. Greathead. The hills we perceive upon the banks were formed by the deposits of sand, which the colliers used to carry as ballast, and which they threw out at the mouth of the Tyne. A steam ferry plies between Nortli and South Shields, and deftly makes its way amongst the lines of ships which are ever passing up and down the river. At some distance from North Shields, the little town of Tynemouth, a watering place, frequented by the inhabitants of the neighbouring counties, well deserves a visit, if it were only for the sake of the ruins of the castle and of St. Mary's Priory, which are very interesting and most picturesque."], [228, "THE PROVINCES 216 The other important ports of this district are Sunderland, at the mouth of the Wear, and Hartlepool at the extreme southern limit of the county of Durham. The coast of Yorkshire is, perhaps, the most beautiful and picturesque of all England, although certain parts of the Devonshire coast present equal beauties. The Yorkshire littoral, too, is dotted from the Tees to the Humber\u2014 that is to say, throu\u00b0hout its whole extent \u2014 with pleasant watering-places, whose attractions are, so to speak, unrivalled. First there is Whitby, an ancient fishing village, but which for some years has been PORT AND CASTLE OF SCARBOROUGH. regarded as a famous watering-place. It is a very quiet little town, built upon the steep shores of the Esk, and it needs no small effort to descend and remount these slopes when proceeding from one side of the town to the other. But the neighbourhood is charming, the beach is delightful. The ruins of the abbey (a curious monument of the 12th century) are amongst the most important and beautiful specimens of ancient religious architecture. The cliffs, which extend from Whitby to the southern extremity of Robin Hood Bay, have great interest for the geologist, because of the varieties they present ; and for the mere idler their height and picturesque aspect suffice to explain the increasing popularity of Whitby. A local industry, due to these cliffs, is the manufacture of a multitude of ornaments in jet, which is found in abundance, and which the inhabitants are very skilful in working. Whitby jet is celebrated, and during the season a con siderable sale of it is effected."], [229, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 217 Whitby is at the eastern extremity of the Cleveland district, the moors and hills of which are easily accessible, and offer to visitors an infinite variety of pleasant sites and of curious places to explore. Following the coast, we soon reach Scarborough, which is called by its inhabitants \" the queen of watering-places.\" The well-merited reputation of Scarborough has made it a fashionable watering place, whither people come from all parts of England. Scarborough is admirably situated on a promontory, at the extremity of which stands an old castle. North and south of the town extends a beautiful semi-circular ROCKS NEAR FILEY. beach. Of Saxon origin, as its name would indicate, it was as early as the 12th century a town of some importance. The castle, built by William le Gros, Earl of Albemarle, in the reign of Stephen, was in the Middle Ages the scene of many a conflict, and in 1665 George Fox, the founder of the sect of Quakers, was imprisoned there. The principal occupation of the 30,000 inhabitants of Scarborough consists in letting lodgings and in amusing the 200,000 visitors who come there every year. Like ants, they lay up an ample provision for the winter; so living is very dear there, as it is in all other fashionable watering-places. In the months of August and September the season is in full swing \u2014 the hotel-keepers are intractable, rooms are at a premium, and everything is very expensive The best hotels, the museum, the aquarium, and the promenades are upon the South Cliff, where we also find the Spa Saloon, for Scarborough possesses two some-"], [230, "THE PROVINCES. 218 what celebrated springs of ferruginous waters. The South Cliff is connected with the town and railway station by a wide avenue and a bridge, which crosses the Ramsdale Valley, 80 feet below. It contains some very beautiful shady walks, and tastefully laid-out gardens. The favourite promenade is the esplanade. Between this and a terrace overlooking the bay is the saloon \u2014 a vast stone building, containing a concert room, a theatre, a lecture room, and a restaurant \u2014 in a word, the casino, which is incumbent on every watering-place which has any self-respect. The interior decoration, in the Renaissance style, is very elegant, embossed gilding alternating with brighter colours. The principal hall is capable of containing 1,500 persons. A terrace, sup ported by small cast-iron columns, runs round three sides of the saloon, thus forming, according to circumstances, a balcony to the first floor, and a covered promenade to the ground floor. Besides concerts of vocal music, which are given in the hall, the casino orchestra plays twice a day on the terrace, which is thronged night and day by a well dressed crowd. The aquarium, which is claimed to be the most beautiful in the world, is enclosed in the ravine that cuts the cliff into two parts, which are united by the cliff bridge that passes over this establishment, whose Moorish architecture is not particularly attractive. Within the building are twenty-six tanks, \"containing a number of specimens of sea and river fishes, alligators, tortoises, and the inevitable seals, whose -evolutions so greatly amuse children of all ages. There are also grottoes arranged with chairs and tables, wherein one can read the papers, or chat while listening to the harmonious strains of the orchestra, which constitutes the great attraction of the aquarium. We descend to the beach by an ingenious tramway, which saves bathers the trouble of walking up and down the steep cliffs. This is an immense boon to invalids, and there are a great number of bathing places in England and France which would do well to imitate Scarborough in this respect \u2014 Biarritz for example. Sandy, soft, and firm, the beach is covered with bathing machines. According to English custom, ladies bathe on one side and the gentlemen on the other. Children play on the sand, construct redoubts and fortifications, on which they plant the British flag. A considerable number of equestrians, some mounted on hired hacks, others upon the modest donkey, plunge through the sands in every sense of the word. In this respect, Scarborough does not set an example worthy of imitation, the presence of these riders being a source of danger to the children, and an annoyance to the promenaders. From the beach, the view of the castle crowning the rock or scar, 300 feet high, is very fine, particularly the old square and massive keep, still imposing, notwithstanding the ravages of time. The cliff to the south of Scarborough, on the side opposite to the castle, is of great interest to geologists; for the tourist, the horizontal bands of varied colours of which it is composed have a very picturesque aspect. Nevertheless, it is as well not to venture too far in the direction of Filey ; the coast is dangerous, the sea which does not go far out rises very quickly, and accidents are by no means infrequent. It is therefore preferable to proceed to Fdey Bay prosaically by the railroad. This is certainly a less picturesque, but a much more prudent course. One scarcely comes to Scarborough to walk through the town ; nevertheless, some"], [231, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS 219 of the old narrow streets inhabited by the fishing population have a particular complexion, full of local colour. They are situated near tbe old harbour, in the neighbourhood of the fish market. From there, we can ascend by St. Mary's Street to St. Mary's Church, ROCKS AT FILEY built in the 12th century, a very curious specimen of Norman architecture. It was very skilfully restored in 1850. From the church to the castle the distance is easy to traverse. We get there by a barbican and a narrow way.

But what a lovely view we obtain from the summit of this rock, whence we perceive to the north the Long Nab, to the south Flamborough Head, which encloses Filey Bay ! In front of us extends the North Sea, its rolling waves reflecting the rays ofthe sun, rushing to break in foam 5<;"], [232, "220 THE PROVINCES against the rocks, which they undermine continually, and of which they have already carried away a portion, The neighbourhood of Scarborough is, like the whole district, exceedingly interesting; in the immediate vicinity are Cornelian Bay and Oliver's Mount, so called, because, as reputed, Oliver Cromwell established a battery there when he was besieging Scarborough. The Mount is a hill 600 feet high, from which a beautiful view of Scarborough and the bay can be enjoyed. At about eight miles from Scarborough is another bathing-place, Filey, where the pretty sandy beach extends for a distance of five miles, describing a graceful curve from the rocky point of Filey Bay as far as Flamborough Head. At Flamborough Head the cliffs arc disintegrated, and present the appearance of a series of needles, grottoes, caverns, and natural arches, which succeed each other in picturesque LAMBI H HEAD. confusion, and serve as resting places and shelters for innumerable sea-birds. Two of these rocks, presenting a vague resemblance to the human form, are called the King and Queen, and are, besides, the most remarkable of all. Flamborough Head separates the Bay of Filey from Bridlington, and protects the latter place from the nortli winds. Bridlington is also a bathing place, which is chiefly frequented by the inhabitants of Hull. From Bridlington Pier the view of Flamborough Head is very fine, and the terraces which extend along the sea-shore form, as well as the pier, very agreeable promenades. Passing on from this place, the coasts and the cliffs gradually become lower, and lose their character of imposing grandeur ; between Bridlington and the mouth of the Humber, the cliffs are not more than 30 feet high, and in all that extensive coast there is not one really picturesque or even pleasant locality. Kingston-upon-Hull, more commonly called Hull, is a town of 176,000 inhabitants, situated on the left bank of the Humber, twenty miles from the sea.

It redeems its commonplace and provincial appearance by the animation which pervades its docks, and the Humber, which is here about two miles wide, and covered with a forest of masts. Hull is the point of departure most in vogue with travellers to the eastern and northern countries, Holland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Russia, and all the Baltic ports. Lines of steamers ply regularly between Hull and Antwerp, Rotterdam, Hamburg, Christiania, St. Petersburg, and many other towns in the North of Europe. Hull is divided into' two portions, the old town and the modern town. The former, of half moon shape, is com pletely surrounded by water, bounded as it is on one side by the river Hull, and on all the other"], [234, "THE PROVINCES. 222 sides by the docks, which describe an almost perfect arc. The only monument which repays the trouble of a visit is Trinity Church, situated in the Market Place. This is an edifice on the cruciform plan, and of Gothic style, from which rises a central tower 150 feet high. Commenced in 1312, and finished at a much more recent period, this church presents examples of different styles ; the nave is Perpendicular, while the transepts and the tower are Ornate, as well as the choir, which is peculiar, inasmuch as it is chiefly built of brick, a very rare feature at that time. The aisles are con tinued on each side to the level of the choir. This arrangement, peculiar to Yorkshire churches, gives to Trinity Church an exceptional width. The choir is very ex tensive; it is lighted by five large bays, and embellished with arcades and pillars very light and lofty. The monu ments and tombs which are in the aisles, as well as the modern stained glass win dows, are but mediocre, but the mouldings of the windows of the nave are curious. OLD HOUSES (HULL). Quitting the church we notice in the open space a statue of gilt bronze, by Sch\u0153maker, representing King George III. The docks, though far from equalling those of London and Liverpool in extent, are of considerable dimensions, the basins alone occupying a space of about 140 acres. The commerce of Hull consists in the importation of all kinds of grain, of timber from the Baltic, of hides and tallow from Russia, and of iron from Sweden, which the manu facturers of Sheffield convert into steel. As for the exports, which, contrary to those of London and Liverpool, exceed the imports, they are composed of cotton stuffs from Lancashire, woollens from Yorkshire, laces from Nottingham, and of salt. The value of the exports was, in 1882, \u00a320,000,000 sterling, and of the imports \u00a323,000,000. During the same year 5,662 vessels of a total burden of 3,000,000 of tons, were entered inwards and outwards. A stroll through the docks of Hull is not wanting in interest.

The bustle here is always considerable, and the arrival or the departure of a steamer is always an interesting sight. The curious and the idle assemble on the bank ; the sailors of the port wearing heavy boots and sou'wester hats, hands in their pockets, and pipes in their mouths, examine the ships with the critical eyes of connoisseurs, and content themselves with replying in monosyllables, with a certain air of patronising superiority to the landsmen who address them. Hull possesses oue of the three Trinity houses in England. This Corporation is charged with the management of the lighthouses, beacons, and buoys of the coast of Yorkshire and of the Humber, and with the nomination of pilots. Liberally endowed, it relieves and takes care of the disabled seamen of the merchant marine of the port of Hull. The Trinity House contains some interesting pictures."], [236, "THE PROVINCES. 224 The strange boat hanging from the ceiling in the lobby is a kaiak captured at sea in 1613 bv some Hull sailors. It was manned by a Greenlander, who refused all nourishment, and died of hunger. They kept his clothes, with which they dressed an effigy, which was placed in the kaiak. The Town Hall, situated inLowgate, a little distance from the market place, is an elegant building in the Italian style, topped by a high steeple, the facade of which, in various coloured stones, is enhanced by the gilding of the balconies. It was erected after the design of Mr. Brodrick, who was also the architect of the Royal Institution, wdiich contains a library of 4,000 volumes, and the Museum of the Literary and Scientific Society. The museum boasts of an in teresting collection of local antiquities, amongst which we find a group carved in wood representing eight persons, the eyes of which are formed with small pieces of quartz. This curious specimen of the art of the \"Northmen\" was discovered in 1836. Hull possesses a botanic garden, in which the con servatory and the lake are very remarkable ; and a BEVERLEY MINSTER. park which was bestowed upon the town by its former mayor, Mr. Pearson. These are the only promenades in the town, the neighbourhood of which is very interesting. In the first place, we must mention Beverley, twenty minutes' run by rail from Hull, where the church, Beverley Minster, is one of the most beautiful Gothic monuments in the district. There are two other ports on the Humber of considerable importance and easily accessible from Hull. These are Goole on the Ouse, and Great Grimsby, down stream from Hull, on the opposite bank, about seven miles from the sea. Between the Humber and the Thames, on the eastern coast, we meet with a number of ports and watering-places which possess only a secondary interest. The"], [237, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 225 coasts of Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex, open to the North Sea, exposed to all the force of the east wind, that \"mistral \" of England, are not very agreeable. The towns of Cromer, Yarmouth, Harwich, and Walton-on-the-Naze do not attract bathers and tourists to the same extent as do the Yorkshire watering-places. IV. THE COMMERCE OF THE SOUTHERN PORTS. THE DOCKYARDS. ROCHESTER, CANTERBURY, DOVER, HASTINGS, BRIGHTON, CHICHESTER. PORTSMOUTH, AND ITS DOCKYARD. THE ISLE OF WIGHT. The commercial ports of the southern coast are of very slight importance, relatively ROCHESTER CATHEDRAL. with London, which is, as we have seen, the most considerable, not only of that part of"], [238, "THE PROVINCES. 226 England, but of the entire United Kingdom. Nevertheless, Dover, Folkestone, and Newhaven, besides being the principal ports of embarkation for travellers to the Conti nent, receive considerable quantities of food-stuffs from France, Spain, and Italy; silks and French fabrics, besides those thousand and one objects of little bulk constituting the commerce of luxury, which it is necessary to bring over by the shortest routes. These three ports admit every year, amongst other things, mountains of fruit, 8,000,000 dozens of eggs, 50,000 cwts. of butter (the greater part of which is furnished by Normandy and Brittany), silks to the value of \u00a37,000,000 sterling, and 1 ,200,000 dozens of pairs of gloves. But thc exports are insignificant. Southampton is the most important port of the south coast, although it is declining. It has had its prosperous days, but it is to be feared they will never return. Plymouth, in Devonshire, is far from equalling, as a commercial port, the towns of whicli we have spoken, and owes its importance to the dockyard established in Devonport, a sort of suburb of it. The dockyards and the military ports, six in number, are, with one exception, situ ated in the south of England. This will be at once under stood, for this portion of the country is the most vulner able ; it is the \" heel of MARTYR'S TRANSEPT (CANTERBURY). Achilles \" of Great Britain ; it is the portion of the coast opposite the continent of Europe, from which she can throw herself on her enemies, and on which she is herself most exposed to their attacks. So these arsenals, fortified with the greatest care, and according to the most approved rules of military art, form, with the system of fortifica tions along the coast, a formidable line of defence, which extends all along the littoral. The dockyards are Deptsord on the Thames, near London, which is only a provision depot, as Woolwich is only a military arsenal, pure and simple, and no longer a port as formerly ; Chatham and Sheerness, on the Medway, the former a dozen miles from the sea, thc latter at the mouth of thc river ; Portsmouth, on the English Channel, opposite Cherbourg; Devonport, to the south of the peninsula formed by the counties of Devon"], [239, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 227 and Cornwall ; and Pembroke, at the end of Milford Haven. These five dockyards, omitting Deptsord, employ 18,200 men, who are engaged in the building and repairing of ships of war and their machinery ; and their cost figures in the Estimates for an annual sum of about \u00a31,600,000 sterling. There are at present (or were lately) in the Government building-yards, thirty-five men-of-war, of which twelve are armoured ships, and ten gunboats. Besides its triple importance, from the military, strategical, and commercial points of view, the south coast is also, in consequence of its situation, that which the English \u2014 and, above all, Londoners, of all classes \u2014 most willingly frequent. Whether it be in the CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL. winter, when certain localities enjoy a mild and temperate climate, or in the summer, during the bathing season, the shores of this district are unquestionably the most beautiful and the pleasantest. They also possess the inestimable advantage of being within a railway journey of an hour or an hour-and-a-half from the metropolis. The Medway is a small river, which rises in the Kentish hills, and falls into the wide estuary of the Thames, below Gravesend. Just before it mingles its waters with those of the Thames, it suddenly widens, and at that place Chatham has been built, a town which is passed by travellers who go from Dover to London by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. Chatham consists of a long tortuous thoroughfare, intersected at irregular intervals by side streets, all very untidy. The dockyard, which dates from the time of Queen Elizabeth, was, according to Camden, the best organized establishment under the sun ; so, during the war with the Dutch, Admiral Ruyter, when ascending the Thames and the Medway, came to bombard it, and very nearly took 57"], [240, "THE PROVINCES. 228 possession of it. Enlarged by successive Sovereigns, the dockyard of Chatham is now one of the strongest and most important places in Great Britain ; it occupies a space of nearly 500 acres, and in the work of improvement the Government has expended more than \u00a32,000,000 sterling in twenty years. Convicts are chiefly employed on the works, and by that means great economy has been effected. All round the town a very complete system of defence has been established; commenced in 1758, and finished in 1807, it now comprises detached forts, earth-works, and trenches of a formidable character. Nevertheless, these forti- fications are somewhat old-fashioned, and, in the opinion of competent authorities, insufficient to resist modern artillery. Consequently, the authorities are now constructing new \"lines\" to shelter Chatham from any operations which an enemy might attempt in case of a war with England. The English fully carry out the pre cept \u2014 \"Si vis pacem, para bellum!\" If English subjects can visit the dock yard without difficulty, foreigners can not; for they are only admitted by special authority to inspect the build ing-yard, slips, basins, workshops, and the artillery park. Many people are thus exposed to disappointment, for want of being furnished with the permit which admits them to the dockyard. Those who have suffered in this way may easily console them selves by going to Rochester, which is only a part of Chatham under another name. Perhaps it would be more WEST GATE (CANTERBURY). correct to say that Chatham is a part of Rochester. The question is a difficult one to solve, for the two towns are one. The principal street of B,ochester is the principal street of Chatham ; and one would not know, in following this road, bordered with a continual line of houses, that we pass from one to the other, were it not for the notice-board placed on the walls by the considerate municipal authorities. There are in Rochester two objects to be visited \u2014 the castle and the cathedral. The castle is situated on the banks of the Medway. The exterior walls of Rochester Castle are in a very lamentable condition ; but the keep, a massive tower, 70 feet square and 100 feet high, is one of the most interesting specimens of the military architecture of the 13th century. From the summit of the tower the prospect embraces a superb panorama of the two towns, the dockyard, the fortifications, the Medway, the Thames, and the pastures of Kent\u2014 the \"Garden of England.\""], [241, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 229 At some distance from the castle we find the cathedral, which was founded in the 11th century by Bishop Gundulph. The most interesting portion of it is the western facade, the great door of which is a superb specimen of Norman architecture. The nave, in the same style, is richly decorated, and embellished with beautiful arches, as are the transepts; but the choir has been almost entirely re-constructed, and is quite modern. One of the most beautiful things in the cathedral of Rochester is the door which opens from the transept to the chapter house ; it is ornamented with very curious DANE JOHN PROMENADE (CANTERBURY). symbolical carvings, most beautifully executed. The significance of these symbols is uncertain ; for they have been interpreted in various ways. Before leaving Rochester, we cannot fail to recollect that Charles Dickens passed his youth there ; and in after years, when fortune smiled upon him, he purchased near the town, at Gad's Hill, a house, in which he died on the 9th of June, 1870. When we have explored the county of Kent, and before returning to the coast, there is one town which particularly attracts our attention. This is the old city of Canterbury, the seat of an Archbishopric, whose titular is styled the Primate of all England ; we have already noticed that the other English Archbishop, his Grace of York, is Primate of England ; let him who can explain these two titles. The Ancient Britons, the Romans, and the Saxons, successively occupied the site where now stands Canterbury, the first Christian town in England. When Saint Augustine came there in 597, it was only a collection of miserable huts; in 851 the town was devastated by the Danes, who in 1011 burnt it to the ground. At this period it already possessed a monastery and a cathedral, on whose site now stands the mag nificent monument, which is the glory of Canterbury. Begun in 1070 by Lanfranc, the first Archbishop of Canterbury, after the Norman Conquest, the cathedral was not finished tdl nearly 1500 a.d., and presents specimens of all periods of Gothic architecture."], [242, "THE PROVINCES. 230 It possesses an imposing facade, flanked by two high embattled towers, each sur mounted by four pinnacles; of these towers, one, the north, is modern; it dates from 1840, and replaced the Arundel tower which fell to ruin. From the centre of the edifice rises another tower, called Bell Harry. It was built by the prior, Goldstone, in 1495, instead of a clock tower, called the Angel's tower, because it was surmounted by a gilt statue. The present tower, 210 feet high, is one of the most beautiful specimens of Perpendicular architecture which England possesses. Having passed Christ Church Gate, an elegant construction of the 16th century, DOVER CASTLE. we enter the church by the south porch. As soon as we enter we are struck by the vast proportions and the regular arrangement of this immense building, which measures no less than 514 feet in length, and 80 feet in height. The nave dates from 1380; it is separated from the choir by a carved screen, which is a marvel of 15th century art. By a somewhat singular arrangement, thc walls of the choir \u2014 which is the longest in England, being 180 feet from one end to the other \u2014 are not parallel, but approach each other towards the eastern extremity like the two limbs of a V. A door at the western end of the choir leads to the Martyr's Transept, where Becket was murdered on the 29th December, 1170. We are shown the stone on which the Archbishop fell beneath the swords of his murderers, and although this chapel has been altered since the 12th century, there are certain portions which still remain intact and unchanged, for instance, the walls, and the door which leads to the cloister, by which Becket and the Knights entered. Lastly, the stones are the same that were there"], [243, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 231 at the time of the murder, and the smad piece that was carried away from one of them was, it is said, taken to Rome with other relics of the Saint. At the eastern extremity of the cathedral is a circular chapel, called the Crown of Becket, which, in consequence of its fine proportions, is one of the most beautiful parts of the fane; there, for a long time, have been preserved in reliquary some fragments of Becket's skull. We know that in 1538, in the reign of Henry VIII., the cathedral was wrecked by the fanatical Protestants, incited by the king, and that the tomb and remains of the Saint were profaned and burned in the open square. The Crown of Becket is the work of English William, who succeeded William of Sens as architect In the south transept is preserved the Arch bishop's throne, a kind of marble chair, which tradi tion states, dates from the time of Saint Augustine, but which is not older than the 13th century. This is the venerable seat on whicli the Archbishops of Canter bury are enthroned. The crypt which ex- tends beneath the choir was built before the year 1085. At the eastern ex tremity we find the chapel and the shrine of the Virgin, which was of great richness, if we judge by the remains of the niche which sheltered the statue. HASTINGS. This portion of the crypt is covered with French inscriptions, which reminds us that in 1561 Queen Elizabeth permitted the French and Flemish refugees to put up their silk looms here. Their descendants, who now number about twenty, still come to worship in the crypt. All round the cathedral, in what is caded the Close, we find at every step traces of the Monastery of St. Augustine. Here are the cloisters, there the Chapter House, farther off the Norman arches, which were part of the Infirmary, and beyond the limits of the monastery an ancient gate, which is now almost the only relic of the palace of the Archbishops. As a town, Canterbury is of little interest \u2014 it is only visited for its cathedral ; some of the streets, however, still preserve the character of the Middle Ages, which is not unbecoming to a locality so full of historic memories. The Missionary Codege is one of the remarkable edifices in the town, and although modern, contains some portions of the Monastery of St. Augustine, on the site of which it was built in 1848. Canterbury"], [244, "THE PROVINCES. 232 also possesses a very ancient portal, called the West Gate, the only one now standing; some fragments of its old ramparts, and the keep of the old castle, now enclosed within the premises of a gas factory, and situated at the extremity of a pretty promenade planted with oak trees, called the Dane John, a corruption of the word donjon. The country round Canterbury, as in all Kent, is pleasing and fertile. It is in the region included between this town, Maidstone, and Faversham, that we find the famous ho\u00b0p gardens, which cover more than 30,000 acres, and contribute largely to the prosperity of the county. The sea-side places most frequented, not only by the English, but by strangers, are those on the Channel. From Margate in Kent, to Penzance in Cornwall, the whole of the south coast is studded with delightful watering places, where the mildness of the climate in winter, the sea breeze in summer, and the pleasure of bathing in calmer waters than those of the Atlantic or North Sea, attract a large number of invalids, idlers, and tourists. In summer, Margate and Rams gate, places dear to the lower middle class and their em ployis; Dover, Folkestone, Eastbourne, and particularly the Isle of Wight, more aristo cratic watering places, arc filled to overflowing with a FAIRLIGHT GLEN (HAST1NQS). well-dressed crowd of bathers of both sexes, yachtsmen and yachtswomen, who wear with a charming swagger the coquettish costumes made fashionable by a very great lady, who wields the sceptre of elegance for want of a better. In autumn and winter, Hastings, Brighton, Bournemouth, and Torquay, as well as the southern portion of the Isle of Wight, offer to people of delicate constitutions, who fear the London fogs and the east winds, a pure and mild air, with some few rays of sunshine. The ideal line of demarcation which separates the aristocracy from the democracy is as noticeable in these watering-places as elsewhere. The members of the upper classes do not like to find themselves in contact with the tradespeople, who, on their part, feel uncomfortable in the presence of their patrons. Thus there is a difference between the watering-places frequented by the former and the latter sections of society. Margate and Ramsgate are situated, the one on the north and the other on the south, of the Isle of Thanet, which forms the extreme border of Kent. These are typical places. The meeting places of the lower middle class and of clerks, these two towns offer a rich harvest of observation to the looker-on. Here popular English life shows itself in all its sincerity \u2014 in all its originality. Paterfamilias, accompanied by his wife, and followed or preceded by a numerous offspring, paces the sandy beach, where a multitude of children with naked limbs, clothed in summer frocks and wearing"], [245, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 233 sun-hats, roll over the sand, or paddle in the rippling waves. Perambulating photo graphers take, for sixpence, portraits, of which they guarantee the resemblance, and are as importunate as the \" niggers \" who, dressed in striped cotton suits, play the banjo while drawling out the latest comic song, the words of which are generally silly. On the pier engaged couples walk up and down with arms round each other, with that sublime indifference which characterizes English lower middle-class lovers, or perhaps leaning over the balustrades or seated on benches, remaining for whole hours hand in hand, staring vacantly, without speaking. After some years, during which Sundays and holidays have been passed in this fashion, the love-making is ended by marriage, or BATTLE ABBEY (NEAR HASTINGS). perhaps by one of those amusing, scandalous actions, called breaches of promise. Seldom, very seldom, is it that the \" capital \" of the young lady is encroached upon, but if she is pretty, if she possess what the police-court reporters call a prepossessing appearance, the sympathetic jury never fails to award her substantial damages; but, if these two could not get on together, is it not much better to find that out before marriage than afterwards ? This truth, so long in coming to light, appears likely to triumph at last, for parliament is occupied with an act to abolish definitively these ridiculous and unfair actions for breach of promise. Dover and Folkestone, so well-known to all who have crossed the channel, have been for many years frequented by bathers, whose greatest amusement consists in watching the disembarkation of the unfortunate passengers who have suffered in the transit, and who, more dead than alive, with faltering steps, make their way towards the trains which are in waiting. A cruel and formidable ordeal is this passage between a double row of curious spectators of both sexes, exchanging remarks more or less good-natured or facetious upon the appearance of the unfortunate travellers. But,"], [246, "THE PROVINCES. 234 patience ; every one will have his turn, he who laughs on Friday, on Sunday will be in a pitiable condition, and on the deck of one of the mail steamers will render up\u2014 his soul ! A sojourn at Dover is very expensive and the game is not worth the candle. Nevertheless the castle is a curiosity which it is as wed to see in passing. It is situated on one of the two hills which overlook the town from east and west, and viewed from the sea, or from the extremity of the pier, has an imposing aspect, with its girdle of walls and towers, above which rises the massive square keep built by Henry II. On the BODIAM CASTLE summit a bomb-proof platform is furnished with formidable artillery. When the weather is clear, the coast of France can be seen, and may be plainly distinguished from Boulogne as far as Gravelines. Dover has only a shingly beach, dangerous because of its rapid slope. We have already seen in what the only amusement of the bathers consists. Notwithstanding this, Dover is much frequented during the summer by holiday-makers, and at all seasons by people on their way to the continent or returning, who are waiting for a calm day to cross, or reposing after a rough passage. These are the people who are so anxious for the Channel tunnel, but unfortunately they have no voice in the matter. We must wait, then, for the carrying out of this project until the English authorities have discovered some means of preventing an army from passing through the twenty-five miles of tube, and of attacking the garrison unawares; or until all European nations disarm and disband their troops. Without hazarding too much we may believe that the former hypothesis is much more likely to be realised than the latter. In the meanwhile"], [247, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 235 the Government has forbidden the English company to proceed with the works, and travellers are still condemned to the miseries of sea-sickness. Dover is the principal and now the only one of the Cinque Ports, which as far back as the Norman Conquest were obliged to furnish for the defence of the kingdom fifty seven vessels, each manned by twenty-one sailors and a midshipman. Of the\u00b0other four ports, Sandwich, Hythe, Romney, and Hastings, the three first are no longer harbours, the sea having retired and left them high and dry, and the fourth is not much better, for as a port Hastings is insignificant. These towns were placed under the jurisdiction of the Lord Warden of the Cinque ports, who was also Constable of Dover Castle, a personage whose functions were formerly BEACHY HEAD. important, but which are now only a pleasant sinecure. The fortunate holder of this ap pointment receives \u00a33,000 a year, and an official residence at Walmer Castle, situated on the coast between Dover and Deal. The present Lord Warden is Earl Granville, whose immediate predecessor was Lord Palmerston. The Duke of Wellington, who was Lord Warden for many years before Lord Palmerston, died at Walmer Castle on the 14th September, 1852. The room in which he breathed his last is still shown, but no stranger is admitted to the castle except during the absence of the Lord Warden. To enumerate all the watering-places in Kent and Sussex would be equivalent to giving a list of all the vidages and hamlets ranged along the coast, and God knows how many there are. Hastings, which is not by any means the place at whicli the famous battle was fought \u2014 the field is seven miles away at Battle \u2014 is a bathing place, strongly recommended for the mildness of its climate, whicli is due to its position, sheltered as it is from the nortli and east winds and open only to the south. It is the resting-place in winter for sufferers from rheumatism and consumption, who are unable to proceed to the south of France. Hastings, which forms but one town with its neighbour, St. Leonard's \u2014 a more modern and more elegant place \u2014 is rich in historical associations. On the beach there, Widiam the Conqueror disembarked on the 20th September, 1066, full of hope and 68"], [248, "THE PROVINCES. 236 ardour; and there, eight centuries later, at a distance of a few years apart, two dethroned and fugitive sovereigns landed on the hospitable shore of Britain : \u2014 King Louis Philippe, in 1848 ; and the Empress Eugenie, in 1870. There is at Hastings a picturesque castle, perched on the summit of the cliff. This was the dwelling-place of the Earls of Lee, who held their domains from William the Conqueror. Destroyed, in the 14th century, by fire, it has remained in a ruinous condition ever since. If Hastings is an agreeable resting-place, the neighbourhood is charming : the downs, which extend right and left, provide delightful excursions, of which the most celebrated is to Fairlight Glen, about two miles from Hastings. The battle-field is, as we have said, nearly seven miles from Hastings, and there has been built on it, in commemoration of the event, an abbey, of which there remains naught but the ruins, enclosed within the extensive domain of the Duke of Cleveland, who only opens his gates to the public once a week. Very interesting, also, are the picturesque ruins of Bodiam Castle, to which the external walls, still well preserved, give an imposing appearance. We almost expect, as we gaze upon these lofty embattled towers and the thick walls, surrounded by a moat full of water, to see the drawbridge lowered to give passage to a troop of men-at-arms, headed by a noble knight wearing helmet and cuirass, clad in armour, and altogether redoubtable, going forth on an expedition from which he will return a conqueror to a chatelaine, whose pleasant face our imagination causes to appear at one of the casements of the highest tower. Between Hastings and Brighton, the most remarkable places on the coast which is traversed by the railway are Pevensey and Eastbourne. Near Eastbourne the cliff is steeply cut away and forms a precipice, the base of which is washed by the sea. This promontory, which is called Beachy Head, is feared by sailors, and has been the scene of many disasters, of which the memory is still preserved. We must not leave Eastbourne without making an excursion to Hurstmonceaux Castle, the most picturesque ruin in this district. This magnificent castle, which is called after its founder, Wallerand de Monceaux, passed afterwards into the hands of the Fiennes family, in whose possession it remained until the 17th century. Situated in a beautiful valley, surrounded by a moat which is now dry, the castle, carpeted with ivy and climbing plants, which cover its walls and wind around its towers, offers a spectacle of rare beauty. Half fortress, half dwelling place, it presents an ensemble of battle mented towers, walls pierced with ogival windows, and turrets defended by ditches, drawbridges, portcullis, and everything that the military science of our ancestors could devise as means of defence. There certainly are ruins more majestic, more imposing than those of Hurstmonceaux, but it would be difficult to find any more picturesque. \" It is the fashion to run down George IV.,\" said Thackeray, \" but what myriads of Londoners ought to thank him for inventing Brighton.\" It is, in fact, to this prince that this pleasing and cheerful watering-place owes its existence, or, at least, its popularity\u2014 a popularity which has never ceased to increase, for Brighton is now as"], [249, "BRIGHTON BEACH."], [250, "THE PROVINCES. 238 frequented as ever it was. The preference of the English for this town is easy to understand. It is only about fifty miles from London, and the express traverses this distance in an hour and five minutes, so a great number of people whose business is in the city pass a portion of the winter at Brighton, making the journey morning and evening as if they lived in a suburb. Although everybody goes to Brighton, it is essentially the rendezvous of the aristocracy, particularly during the winter. The town is built along- the sea front for a distance of about three miles. Fine houses, elegant villas, and sumptuous hotels face the sea, the view of which from all points of the long road which separates the houses from the beach is very beautiful. Under two different names\u2014 the King's Road and the Marine Parade, this charming sunny drive, bordered with elegant shops, extends the whole length of the town. It is a scene of continual anima tion, promenaders and equestrians of both sexes, donkey-carriages and goat chaises, carrying delighted children, pass backwards and forwards in continual streams. Everybody seems happy in the bright sun shine, which warms the body and cheers the mind. It is the West End of London, transported to the seaside, BRIGHTON AQUARIUM. with all its aristocratic residents, its luxury and elegance \u2014 in a word, London-super Mare. Two good piers, the West Pier and the Chain Pier, each about 350 yards long, extend seawards, and form most agreeable promenades. The former, opposite Regency Square, terminates with a large platform, sheltered from wind and rain, where a band plays every day. The latter, on the suspension principle, is sustained by four pairs of cast-iron pillars, at equal distances from each other. This is the less frequented of the two, but the better situated to judge of the appearance of the town from the sea. Between the two piers is the aquarium, built in 1872; a large building, measuring 630 feet, which cost more than \u00a340,000. This is the most agreeable place in Brighton, and in which the time can be most pleasantly passed. Besides thc aquarium, properly called, that is to say, in addition to the fifty tanks in thc naves, which are stocked with every species of fish, the edifice includes reading-rooms, a concert-hall, a conservatory filled with aquatic plants, and a restaurant. The most remarkable building in Brighton is the Pavilion. Erected in 1784 by Holland, for the Prince Regent (George IV.), it was at first merely a pleasure-house, where the Prince, in company with the beautiful Mrs. Fitzherbert and the debauches of his suite, passed the time joyously \u2014 even too joyously; and to such a point did they carry their enjoyment that the stern Lord Chancellor Thurlow, when invited to dine"], [251, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 239 with the Prince Regent replied, \" I cannot, your Royal Highness, until you keep better company.\" In 1818, when China and China-wares were all the fashion, as \" Japaneserie'* is now-a-days, the Regent caused his house to be pulled down, and Nash built him a Chinese Pagoda with cupolas, domes, and minarets, which irritated Walter Scott to such a degree that he urged one of his friends to set fire to it. William IV. afterwards passed some seasons at the Royal Pavilion ; but Queen Victoria, who never cared much for Brighton, sold the Pavilion in 1850. The town purchased it for the purpose of assembly rooms, which include concert, ball, and reading rooms ; in fact, it is the Casino of Brighton. Of old Brighton there remains but one edifice, St. Nicholas' Church, in which has been erected a monu ment to the late Duke of Wellington \u2014 that is all. But the charm of Brighton con sists in its pure air and climate, tern- CHAIN PIER (BRIGHTON). perate even in winter; its blue sea, with its ever changing reflections, the ripplin\u00b0 waves, which are ever gilded with the sun's rays, and whose crests are sometimes coquettishly fringed with white foam, beneath the warm breath of the south wind. And the sea, the sun, and the air cannot be described. We love them, we admire them, we seek for them. When, one hour away from London and its fogs, we find them united, a source of pleasure and of health, we are ready to exclaim with the illustrious author"], [252, "THE PROVINCES. 240 of \" Vanity Fair,\" and we cannot do better than borrow his words \u2014 \" One of the best physicians our city has ever known, is kind, cheerful, merry Doctor Brighton.\" For those who only go to Brighton for pleasure there is an extremely well managed theatre, balls, concerts, and well-conducted clubs, without reckoning cricket and lawn tcnnis. In winter the visitor can ride with the harriers and foxhounds; in the summer there are races, for Brighton possesses an excellent race-course, with a good stand, boating parties, yachting excursions, sea-bathing, and the thousand and one amusements of a fashionable watering-place. The neighbourhood abounds in charming walks, par ticularly across the south downs, which extend along the coast as far as Newhaven. FLEET OF FISHING BOATS (BRIGHTON). The Devil's Dyke, on the north, is a curious place. It is a steep, natural trench, about 300 feet deep, which one regards as the work of Titans. There is a some what curious legend attached to it. It would appear that after the introduction of Christianity into England, the county of Sussex was rapidly covered with churches, erected by the efforts of the faithful. The devil was very much put out about this, and determined to inundate the whole county by cutting a canal by which he would introduce the water from the sea. This was not a bad idea, but Messire Satanas, instead of undertaking the work himself, confided it to one of his aides-de-camp, a young devil, rather new in the business, as we shall see. This horned engineer had orders only to work during the night, and to retire at daybreak. But it happened that one night an old woman heard him picking up the ground, and looked out of the window to ascertain the cause of the sound which had so greatly astonished her. As she could not see very well, she lighted a candle, whose flickering gleam was taken by the inexperienced devil for the first rays of the rising sun. To throw down his tools and decamp was, for the imp, the work of a moment. When he reached the ordinary residence of his Satanic master, he was received with all the honour his un worthy cowardice deserved, and, out of spite, Satan resolved to abandon his project of inundating the county of Sussex. The moral of this story is that the devil sometimes thinks the moon is made of green cheese, and that if women are curious, this great fault has at least, in one instance, been the means of doing good."], [253, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 241 The little town of Chichester, celebrated for its cathedral, although situated inland is so near the coast, that we cannot think of passing it in silence whde speaking of this part of Sussex. r s \u2022<= An ancient Roman station, as its name indicates, Chichester, hke Chester, and many other English towns, still preserves the arrangement of the Roman camp.

This nave is flanked with aisles, which give it a width out of all proportion to its length, and equally shortens the transepts. The choir, of Norman architecture, is long and narrow, and con- tains some curious gro- tesque sculpture. It is closed by a screen, erected in the 15th century by Bishop Arundel. Of the exterior the most remarkable part of the cathedral is the pointed spire, 270 feet high, recently built in place of that which fell down in 1861, and of which it is the exact copy. CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL. The oldest as weU as the most important of all the royal dockyards is that of Portsmouth. As at Chatham, every stranger who wishes to visit the establishment must be provided with a card of admission, otherwise entrance will be peremptorily refused. Having obtained the permit, he has only to present it at the dockyard gate, when all doors will then, and only then, be opened to him. Although as early as the 13th century mention is made of Portsmouth in ancient documents, it is to Henry VIII. that the honour of founding this port, as wed as those of Woolwich and Deptsord, is due. Chatham and Sheerness date from the time of"], [254, "THE PROVINCES. 242 Elizabeth; Devonport from the reign of William and Mary; and Pembroke from George III.'s time. From the time of its foundation till the 16th century, Portsmouth underwent successive alterations, and its fortifications were not greatly modified since the latter period to our own days-even during the wars at the end of the last century. But the introduction of rifled cannon necessitated a radical change in its defences; and the Royal Commission of 1859, after long and minute examination of the question, recom mended new fortifications, armed with more than a thousand guns, and of which the cost was estimated at nearly \u00a32,500,000 sterling for the masonry only. The works, as well as many others rendered necessary by the constant improvements in the armament of European vessels of war, have been carried out. Portsmouth is considered impregnable, but that fact does not prevent the addition of a fort every year, or of a new battery. To account for the lines of defence it is necessary to be acquainted with the situation of the place. Portsmouth is situated on an island (Portsea Island), four miles long, two-and-a half wide; bounded on the north by a narrow canal called Portsbridge Creek, which forts at Portsmouth. separates it from the main- land; on the west by Portsmouth harbour; on the east by Langston harbour; and on the south by the famous roads of Spithead, formed by the arm of tbe sea which divides the mainland from the Isle of Wight. The latter plays the part of an immense dam, and contributes not a little towards making Portsmouth harbour a safe anchorage for men-of-war. Portsmouth is composed of four towns, namely, Portsmouth proper, Portsea, Southsea, and Gosport. It has a total population of 131,000 inhabitants. The three first-named towns are in the same island. Gosport is situated opposite to Portsmouth, on the tongue of land which encloses, on the west, the harbour. This harbour, the entrance of which is only 270 yards wide, is defended by Blockhouse Fort on the Gosport side, and the Point Battery on the Portsmouth side, forms, as it extends inland, a beautiful basin four miles in length, and of an average width of about two miles. The line of defence includes the two straits of the Solent and Spithead, between the mainland and the Isle of Wight, which bristles with fortresses and batteries, and a girdle of forts extending all round the harbour from Browndown, on the west of Gosport, to Portsea, passing by the heights of Portsdown to the north. Lastly, on the sandbanks lying between St. Helen's and Portsmouth, five granite forts have been constructed, incased with iron plates, and armed with guns of the largest calibre. One of these forts, built entirely of iron, is surmounted by four revolving turrets, each containing two guns which throw projectiles weighing 600 lbs. In order to build these formidable fortresses"], [255, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 243 it was found necessary to lay the foundations, walls of masonry, fifty feet thick, twenty one feet below the level of low tides. It will thus be perceived that the key of England is well guarded. Portsmouth is the dockyard. There is nothing else to see in it unless No. 12, High Street, which is the house where the fanatic Felton assassinated the Duke of Buckingham. The entrance of the dockyard is at Portsea. We reach it by the Hard, and after having penetrated into the sacred enclosure, PORTSMOUTH ROADSTEAD. one of the dockyard police takes the visitor in charge, and pilots him amid this collec tion of magazines, building yards, and docks, which cover an area of not less than 250 acres. First, we see the mast ponds (basins in which is immersed the timber for the purpose of seasoning), and the workshops in which it is fashioned into masts. The rope-house is an enormous three-storeyed building, 1,100 feet long, in which are made cables thirty inches in circumference; but chain cables have now superseded these ropes. All around are stacked gigantic anchors, seven yards long, and thick in proportion, weighing nearly five tons. A vessel like the Minotaur carries four of this size. C9"], [256, "THE PROVINCES. 244 Having passed the sail-yard, we reach the dry docks, of which there are eighteen. The largest are 200 yards long. In 1864 there were only eleven of these docks ; since that period, when the dockyard had only one basin of a little more than two acres in extent, four have been constructed to the north of Portsea, of a total area of more than 70 acres. Farther on, are five covered sheds, in which ships of all sizes are built, surrounded by the various workshops, forges, and a foundry. The dockyard hands for many years have been, as it were, permanently employed and not liable to be dismissed at a day's notice\u2014 at least, this is generally the case. After a certain number of years they can claim a pension. The State is thus assured of a selected staff of men who are more trustworthy than those which they used formerly THE DOCKYARD (PORTSMOUTH). to take on according to their needs. Besides the workmen attached to the arsenal, the authorities, in times of emergency, engage men by the day. The block machinery is the great curiosity of Portsmouth. By the aid of this ingenious series of forty-four machines, invented by the French Engineer, Brunei, in 1808, ten men can make 140,000 blocks of various sizes in a year. We may estimate the importance of this invention when we consider that a man of war has 1,500 or 2,000 blocks, and that there are 200 different kinds of blocks in use in the Royal Navy. The gun wharf is in that part of the dockyard situated between Portsea and Ports mouth ; and occupies about fifteen acres. Here we see mountains of projectiles and cannons of ad sizes; not far from there are the store-houses of arms, which contain sufficient to equip 25,000 sailors. In the harbour, opposite the dockyard, is moored the Victory, Nelson's flag ship at the Battle of Trafalgar. Visitors are admitted, and are shown the spot where the hero fell mortally wounded, as well as the cock-pit in which he breathed his last sigh. This vessel, a very beautiful specimen of the old line-of-battle ship, contrasts strangely with the modern men of war, lying low in the water and without masts."], [257, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 245 Special permission must be obtained to. visit the Excellent, the gunnery ship, the St. Vincent, in which is the naval school, and the great Indian troopships. We must also have leave to view the Queen's yacht, the Victoria and Albert, a magnificent vessel, of 1,000 tons and 500 horse-power, the length of whose deck is 414 feet. The saloons and cabins of this yacht are marvels of order, elegance, and taste. Portsmouth dockyard is under the orders of a Rear- Admiral, who is assisted by a numerous mditary and civil staff. Portsmouth is also an important military command. HIGH STREET (PORTSMOUTH). Gosport, a suburb of Portsmouth, is the food depot of the Royal Navy; there we find the Royal Clarence Victualling Yard. We cross the harbour in a steam ferry or floating bridge built of iron. This is a curious boat, 90 feet long and 54 wide, in which 40 carriages and 500 passengers can easily be accommodated ; a kind of draw bridge fixed at either end facilitates the embarkation and disembarkation of horses and carriages. Two steam engines propel this heavy mass, which passes to and fro every quarter of an hour. There are besides this floating bridge small steamers plying between Gosport and Portsmouth. The Victualling Yard consists of a series of immense warehouses, in which are stored enormous quantities of food of all kinds, bread, salt, meat, wine, rum, flour, biscuits, and beer. A special building serves as a clothing store, and there is an enormous reservoir, fed by wells, 360 feet deep, from which the vessels procure their supplies of fresh water. In the dietary of the English sailors, cocoa plays a great part."], [258, "THE PROVINCES. 246 and in the Royal Navy they consume eleven times more of it than of coffee, and nearly four times as much of it as of tea. In the year 1882 there were stored about l,152,6561bs. of cocoa, 100,240 lbs. of coffee only, and 308,359 lbs. of tea. The Queen invariably embarks at Gosport for Osborne, a private landing-place and a waiting-room in the Victualling-Yard being always reserved for Her Majesty's use. Behind the storehouses are immense barracks. Passing in front of these, we reach the town of Gosport itself, which is absolutely devoid of interest, and, like Portsmouth and Portsea, dirty and untidy. After having traversed it, and it is not a great distance, and crossed the Haslar bridge, we find ourselves in front of the magnificent Royal OSBORNE HOUSE (ISLE OF WIGHT) Naval Hospital, which is sufficiently large to accommodate 2,000 invalids. It was built in 1762. It is composed of a central building and two wings, forming three sides of a garden, the centre of which is occupied by a chapel, and the houses inhabited by the commandant, and the members of the medical and administrative staffs. The hospital, four storeys high, contains 114 rooms, with 20 beds in each, and is the largest establishment of its kind in England. Behind it we find the building-yard for the gunboats, and a little farther on towards the sea, Haslar Barracks. All this part of the coast bristles with forts and batteries, armed with triple rows of guns, the cross-fire of which would render any attempt at landing impossible. The Bay which extends between the mainland and the Isle of Wight, which can clearly be seen, and where we can perceive the high towers of Osborne, is called Stokes Bay. The branch of the railway runs down to a landing-stage, whence one can cross to the island in about twenty minutes. If we wish to return to Portsmouth, we must retrace our steps, and cross by the Floating Bridge. As we go over this bridge we will be reminded that there, on board"], [259, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 247 COWES (isle of wight). the Monarch on the 14th of March, 1757, Admiral Byng was shot, sacrificed by the ministry of which the Duie of Devonshire was the head, to public opinion which had been wrongly aroused against a brave sailor who had been betrayed by the fortune of war. \" In that country,\" said Voltaire, \" it is good to kill an admiral occa- sionally, to encourage the others.\" The Floating Bridge lands us at the end of Broad Street, which leads to the Parade, at the end of which is the Esplanade of Southsea, which has now for some years been a well-frequented watering-place in summer. At some distance from Southsea, in Spithead-roads, a red buoy marks the place where, on the 29th of August, 1782, the Royal George, three-decker, suddenly foundered, with nearly 1,200 sailors and soldiers on board, of whom only 300 were saved. The ship had been hauled down to caulk a small leak (a very frequent opera- tion in those days, and one attended with so little danger that the Admiral had not even sent the women and children ashore), when a sudden gust of wind heeled her over. The ports had been left open, the water poured in, and the Royal George went to the bottom. The admiral and his officers perished with the ship, and the only persoi.s on board who escaped death were those sailors who were on watch at the time of the disaster. For many years the hull of this enormous ship remained at Spithead, a standing menace to navigation, and without anyone being able to remove it. It was not until 1839 that Colonel Pasley, an officer of Engineers, assisted by a number of divers, succeeded in demolishing the Royal George in about 18 months. At that time a most stirring incident happened, a regular drama at the bottom of the sea, and such a one, which if invented by a novelist, would have been thought exaggerated. Two rival divers quarrelled concerning a piece of wood, which both seized at the same time, and then"], [260, "THE PROVINCES. 248 commenced a terrible struggle between them, ten fathoms beneath the surface. The varied incidents of this duel under water, in the solitude of the ocean, far from human ken are more easy to imagine than to describe. By an almost superhuman effort one of the two men, named Girvan, broke the glass eyes of the helmet of his adversary, Jones, who, blinded, and almost suffocated by the water, had the presence of mind to pud the alarm cord. He was hauled to the surface more dead than alive. Leaving Portsmouth, we cannot but regret the absence of any monument or statue to recall the fact that it was at Landport that Charles Dickens was born on the 15th of February, 1812. The Isle of Wight occupies a unique position in the series of English country resorts and watering places. This little lozenge - shaped island, Which measures twenty-two mdes from east to west, and fourteen from north to south, is a privileged spot. It is easily accessible from Portsmouth or South ampton : the former route is the shorter, the latter the more picturesque. When we go by Southampton, as soon as we have got out of South ampton Water, we perceive the island rising from the waves like a basket of flowers. In the foreground, the small white houses of Cowes stand ventnor (isle of wight). out against the darker colouring of the wooded hills which rise in gentle slopes, and unite with a second line of heights less distinguishable in the distance. The river Medina, which separates the island into two parts, also divides the town of Cowes, half of which is romantically placed on either bank. East Cowes, on the left, is over looked by Osborne House, the private residence of the Queen, the towers of which are visible from a distance. West Cowes, on the other side, is the most animated part of the island. The steamer touches there. At the mouth of the Medina stands Cowes Castle, a kind of fortress built by Henry VIII., which now serves as the Club House of the Royal Yacht Squadron, of whicli Cowes, in the yachting season, is the head quarters. The town is commonplace enough ; its narrow streets, the houses in which are small but neat, the steps being whitened, and the brass polished according to English fashion, are lined with shops in which articles of yachts' equipment are principally sold, such as ropes, sails, blocks, compasses, provisions, flags and lanterns, which are heaped up in picturesque confusion. The tailors, costumiers, and hatters offer you nothing but yacht ing costumes and yachting hats."], [261, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 249 Ladies and gentlemen are clothed in blue or white serge, the men wearing yachting caps, the women sailor hats or caps, which they sport with a charming ease of carriage. Very elegant are these costumes which English women love to wear for their different sports \u2014 for lawn tennis, I for walking, for fishing I or boating parties; I somewhat eccentric, I perhaps a little loud, but with such daring and coquettish effect, that the fault is easily overlooked in the pleasing ensemble. One promenade, the Parade, from which a view of the harbour is obtained, is very delightful. During the yachting season, which lasts from May 1st to November 1st, a number of yachts shanklin chine (isle of wight). are at anchor, and as many of the owners of these pretty vessels live on board of them, the passing to and fro of the boats between the town and the yachts, give to the \" roads \" an incessant animation and movement. In the evening there are dinners, concerts, and dances on board the yachts, and the sounds of the bands, and the peals of laughter"], [262, "THE PROVINCES. 250 carried shorewards by the breeze, echo in the streets. In August the regatta attracts a great number of visitors. The Prince of Wales, the Commodore of the Club, is invariably present, and takes part in the racing; the Queen contributing a cup of the value of 100 guineas for the chief prize. A ferry plies between West Cowes and East Cowes, situated on the right bank of the Medina, which is here about a mile wide. On the other side of the town, in the midst of a park of 5,000 acres, is Osborne House, built after the designs of Prince Albert. This residence does not belong to the Crown ; it is the private property of the Queen who purchased the domain in 1840. Osborne House is in the Italian style, of irregular plan, consisting of a principal building, flanked by a tower 90 feet high, enclosing a clock, and of a very high lateral pavilion surmounted by a square tower. Iu this latter portion are the Royal apart ments. Osborne House is very richly and very elegantly furnished and decorated. It contains a beautiful collection of modern objects of art. The gardens and the park extend down to the sea, and a special pier has been constructed for the exclusive use of the Queen. Strangers are not admitted to Osborne under any pretext whatever. En closed in the Park are a Swiss chalet and a farm, wherein Prince Albert loved to follow his favourite occupation \u2014 undercliff (isle of wight). agriculture. Thanks to his enlightened ideas, the sod, naturally poor, has been improved and fertilized. Ryde, about six miles from Cowes, is a town of about 2,000 inhabitants, situated opposite Portsmouth, and which, by its amusements and resources, is much more agreeable than Cowes, where the stranger, if he is not a friend of one of the yachtsmen, does not know how to pass his time. He is like a man who has been pitchforked into an assembly in which he knows no one, and where the sight of people amusing them selves renders his isolation more complete. Seen from the end of the Pier, the town, which is built on the slope of a gentle eminence, the houses being surrounded by pretty gardens, presents a pleasing and gay appearance. On the right the coast, wooded and covered with luxuriant vegetation to the very edge of the water, is undulating and broken ; on the left extends the wide esplanade, and on a hill is a fine turreted mansion of red brick, rising proudly in a beautiful situation. When we arrive at the end of the Pier, Union Street, tbe principal thorough fare of Ryde, is before us, the arcades of which form a covered promenade in case of rain. Ryde is chiefly the rendezvous of bathers and tourists, for it is the most"], [263, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 251 convenient point of departure for those who wish to make the tour of the island by land or sea. This latter excursion is extremely agreeable on a fine summer's day, and occupies about seven hours. When one cannot afford so much time, the railway offers many facili ties to visit the most remarkable places quickly. The neighbourhood of Ryde, like every other part of the island, is extremely picturesque, whether we proceed along the Binstead side, or along the coast in the direction of Sea View, we traverse the sandy shore, where numbers of bathers disport them selves. From Ryde to Ventnor is half-an-hour by rail. Ventnor is situated at the extreme south of the island \u2014 the warmest and most sheltered part of it. In the summer bathers and tourists congregate there; in the winter it is the resting-place of consumptive people and convalescents. In December the myrtles and geraniums bloom in the open air, and one would fancy one's self hundreds of miles from Great Britain. The mild climate of this district has changed the humble village of Ventnor into a small and pros- perous, if not gay, town ; for the appearance of the large hospital, and the presence of such a CARISBROOKE CASTLE (ISLE OF WIGHT). LiU"], [264, "THE PROVINCES. 252 number of invalids detract somewhat from the pleasure one feels in exploring this charming place. Between Ventnor and St. Catherine's Point extends the Undercliff, a kind of plateau, seven miles long, and about half-a-mile wide, bounded on one side by the sea, and on the other by precipitous cliffs nearly 600 feet high. The broken ground offers a most pleasing and yet very strange appearance, here and there forming bays, caverns, and grottoes, where thick and tenacious vegetation clings to the side of the cliff, and covers the fallen boulders. The dark green of the ivy is relieved by the bright colours of the roses and wild flowers which grow in abundant and most admired disorder. Deep clefts and pdes of stone, caused by the breaking away of the cliffs, are met with at every step; here is a pyramid, there an enormous rock, whose grey mass throws curious shadows upon the green sward. Then the clumps of hawthorn and other trees, such as chestnut and ash, extend their leafy branches far and wide, and have insinuated them selves, one cannot tell how, amidst the grey rocks in a sublime confusion. This picturesque chaos is the result of a series of landslips, of which the most recent occurred between 1810 and 1818. In 1799, a farm and a hundred acres of land were overwhelmed at once. These catastrophes, scientists say, are no longer to be feared. Let us trust they are right. From Ventnor, we can, by following the path, reach Shanklin on foot ; this is a very agreeable walk. Here there is a Chine, that is to say, a wooded ravine, through which a stream tumbles from a height of about 20 feet, and rejoices in the name of a cascade. The entrance of this miniature valley is defended by a gate; for all the curiosities in the Isle of Wight are carefully guarded, and exploited very skilfully by the intelligent natives, who make considerable profits from them. It will be understood, therefore, that it is necessary to give a few pence to the guardian, who takes care of the walks, trims the trees, and looks after the rocks, so as to give Shanklin Chine the appearance of an artificial ravine. Too many flowers ! Too many flowers ! Now one remark by the way. If the doUar is all powerful in America, the shilling in England has almost magic qualities ; it is astonishing how much may be accomplished in the matter of opening gates, conciliating policemen, caretakers, and railway employis with the aid of this little round piece of money which no one ever asks for, but which everyone accepts so discreetly, and which procures for the traveller\u2014 who knows how to make use of it \u2014 so much comfort, and the avoidance of so much trouble and formality. Here we may ask a question, the drift of which will be evident to every one. Is the immoderate bestowal of baksheesh in the east an English importation, or have the English borrowed it from the Orientals ? The gate of the chine being opened, the gratuity having produced the ordinary effect, the caretaker conducts the visitor through the whole extent of his little domains and does the honours with remarkable courtesy. The visits last only a few minutes, and as there is nothing else to see in Shanklin we have only to take the train to Newport, the capital of the Isle of Wight. This is a little town situated in the centre of the island, on the Medina, which is so far navigable. Newport is without any particular characteristics, but is clean, and on"], [265, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 253 market days very ani mated. It possesses no monuments, with the ex ception of St. Thomas' Church, in which is the tomb of Princess Eliza beth, the daughter of Charles I., who died at the age of fifteen, on the 8th September, 1650, in Carisbrooke Castle, where she was in prison.

It is situated on a hill, 240 feet above the level of the sea, in a commanding position. A narrow valley separates it from the village of Carisbrooke, formerly a place of some importance, and of which, in former days, Newport, as its name indicates, was the port. We enter the castle by the Elizabeth Gate. A stone bridge crosses the moat, and leads to a second archway, flanked by two round towers, and defended by two port cullises. We have then on the left the portion of the castle in which Charles I. was kept im prisoned for a year, and from which he made two unsuccessful attempts to escape. In front was the Governor's residence. THE NEEDLES (ISLE OF WIGHT), These several apartments have been skilfully restored by Mr. Hardwick, as well as the framework that covers the well, which is 300 feet deep. The keep occupies the site of the ancient Saxon fortress. From the summit there is a beautiful view. At our feet lie Carisbrooke and Newport, whence the Medina, like"], [267, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 255 a silver ribbon, winds its way to mingle its waters with the Solent between the two parts of Cowes. In the distance the Hampshire coast may be distinguished in a warm haze, from which rise the heights of Portsdown, crowned by their formidable batteries. To right and left extends the chain of hills, which, running north and south, divides the island into two parts. At a short distance from the castle we find the ruins of a Roman villa, discovered in 1859, and which has since been carefully protected. An almost straight road leads from Newport to Parkhurst Forest \u2014 an ancient royal chase, now a nursery ground. At the entrance are the barracks, erected in 1798 \u2014 extensive red brick buildings capable of accommodating 3,000 troops, \u2014 and Parkhurst Prison . It is as well to take advantage of a stay at Newport to visit the western side of the island, the little village of Yarmouth (which must not be confounded with the town of the same name in Norfolk), and the peninsula and bay of Freshwater. There are omnibuses which ply regularly between Newport and these localities, but it is better to hire a carriage and proceed at one's leisure. Lord Tennyson, the poet laureate, owns a pretty mansion in the neighbourhood of Freshwater, called Farringford House, which he occupies during the greater part of the year. Returning from Newport, at which we stay only long enough to make these excursions to Carisbrooke and Freshwater, we take the railway to Cowes, whence we can embark for Southampton or Portsmouth, or to go round the island by sea, which is a most agreeable way of winding up a visit to the Isle of Wight. From Cowes the steamer passes through the Solent, the arm of the sea which separates Hampshire from the Isle of Weight, and gets narrower up to Yarmouth. We pass between Hurst Castle on the mainland, and the three forts which face it, and defend the entrance to the strait forming the advanced defences of Portsmouth. The steamer, doubling the extreme point of the island, passes round the Needles\u2014 three sharp rocks which stand up like cathedral spires, and are inhabited by flocks of sea-birds. Then we come in sight of the cliffs of Freshwater Bay, St. Catherine's Down, and Ventnor, where sometimes the steamer puts in. We then continue our course northwards, passing in succession Shanklin, Sandown, and Bembridge Point, whicli is defended by a powerful fort. Thence we regain Ryde, passing the Spithead forts, which are built on the sand-banks in the middle of the strait."], [268, "THE PROVINCES. 256 V.

Southampton, the chief town of Hampshire, is also the chief town of the county of Southampton, which includes the limits of the town. This may seem strange, but granted the anomalies so frequent in England, and to which one must accustom one's self without seeking to fathom them, there is nothing in this fact which ought particularly to astonish everyone who travels through this interesting county, respecting which ought to have been written the pretty line : \" Glissez, mortels, n'appuyez pas ! \" Well situated at the end of a wide and navigable estuary (Southampton Water), near the junction of the rivers Test and Itchen, Southampton was evidently destined to become a considerable port. In fact, in the 15th and 16th centuries it carried on a large commerce with the Levant; but in the following century the prosperity of Southampton was arrested in consequence of the development of its rival Portsmouth, and of the arrival of the plague in 1665, which decimated the inhabitants. For a hundred years Southampton continued to decline, but at the commencement of the 19th century the Duke of Bedford, who from time to time resided there, brought it temporarily into fashion again; about 1840 the railroad connected it with London, and the docks being opened, the prosperity of the port and town rapidly increased. For many years eight great lines of steamers communicating with all parts of the world, and numbering amongst them more than a hundred ships, made it their headquarters ; but recently some of these companies have removed their* business to London, whence the embarkation and disembarkation of merchandise and passengers is effected more quickly and at less cost. Nevertheless, Southampton is still the most important port in the district, com mercially speaking. Statistics value the imports at \u00a39,000,000 sterling, and the exports at \u00a37,750,000. But since the steamers of the Peninsular and Oriental Company \u2014 that famous association designated by the English as the \" P. and O. \" \u2014 a title which, pronounced quickly, sounds to French ears like the word piano \u2014 since the vessels of this company, which has established its headquarters in London, no longer start from Southampton, and now that one or two other great lines have followed its example, the port has received a shock from which it will suffer for a long time to come. Southampton is certainly one of the most essentially English towns which one meets with in the southern counties; it has preserved its national characteristic in a very"], [269, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 257 remarkable manner which strikes one at the first glance. Of very ancient origin it possesses monuments of great interest, although they are few in number. These are for the most part in the old quarters in the neighbourhood of the river Test. The principal thoroughfare is the High Street, itself one of the local curiosities. BAROATE (SOUTHAMPTON). It is a fine wide road, almost straight, which has been, with some exaggeration, compared to the High Street of Oxford, and is bordered with houses of curious style, which bestows upon it an air of antiquity that is not wanting in picturesqueness ; the greater number of them, in fact, display windows surrounded by semi-circular and polygonal projections, ornamented with mouldings and carvings, which are in keeping with the fronts and signs of the shops. This street is divided almost exactly in the centre by a fine gateway, called the Bar Gate, which formerly was a portion of the ancient fortifications, and is an excellent specimen of the military architecture of the Middle Ages. Sixty feet wide and as many deep, the Bar Gate seen from the south side displays a central arch flanked by two smader ones, supporting an embattled structure pierced by four pointed mullioned windows, and containing a niche which sustains a statue"], [270, "THE PROVINCES. 258 of George III. in Roman garb. The southern or exterior fa9ade is different from the other, the central arch which projects being flanked by two pilasters decorated with paintings and defended by two heraldic lions. The upper storey follows the same lines, and is machicolated and embattled. The old town walls have almost entirely disappeared ; the portions which still remain are a round tower called the Arundel Tower, and one square tower, the walls of the old castle forming a crescent supported by curious arches, and the portion of the rampart called the Arcade. In one of the small streets of this quarter is a building of the 12th century, called the\" Palace of King John, which is without doubt one of the oldest houses in England. Two other gates, the West Gate and South Gate, older than the Bar Gate, are also interesting, although less ornamented and less beau tiful. At Southampton is the office of the Ordnance Survey Department. There are two' editions of their excellent map \u2014 one on the scale of 25, and the other 6 inches to the mile ; the latter is reduced from the former by an ingenious photo graphic process. This map, which corresponds with the French Carle de Vetat Major, is got up with the greatest SALISBURY CATHEDRAL care, and constantly revised by a staff under the control of the Secretary of State for War. Four companies of Royal Engineers, and 2,000 civilians under the order of a colonel, are constantly employed in this work. The Ordnance Survey figures in the Estimates for a sum of \u00a3260,000 sterling. At some distance from Southampton, on the left shore of Southampton Water, are the picturesque ruins of Netley Abbey and the Military Hospital erected in 1856, after the Crimean War. This fine building, 1,200 feet in length, of red brick dressed with stone, has no merit from an architectural point of view, but is admirably arranged as a hospital. It con tains 138 rooms and 1,000 beds. Some miles inland from Southampton stands a very ancient and interesting town. We refer to Salisbury. Salisbury or New Sarum is situated in a pretty and fertile valley at the confluence of three rivers. It is a well-built town with regular streets ; the houses, for the most part, are of brick, but some of the oldest buildings are of wood."], [271, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS 259 The origin of Salisbury is rather curious. In the 13th century a quarrel arose between the Bishop and the clergy and the Commandant of the castle of Old Sarum In consequence of this depute, the dignitaries of the Church emigrated and founded a new town New Sarum, about a mile and a half from the old one. The majority of the mhabrtants followed the clergy, and Old Sarum was soon abandoned ; no tr ee of it now exists, while Salisbury con- tinues to prosper. The principal monument in the town is the cathedral, which rises majestically from the midst of a beautiful garden called the Close, to which access is obtained by three curious gates. This is pro bably the only one of the ancient English cathedrals whose history is known to us from its foundation to the pre sent time. The first stone was laid on the 28th of April, 1220, by Bishop Poore. This beautiful monument is in the form of a double cross ; it is one of the purest examples of the early English Gothic, and, above all, remarkable for the regularity and unity of its style \u2014 due to the fact that the whole edifice, with the excep- tion of the west front and the spire, was erected in the short space of thirty-eight years. This spire, the highest in England, and one of the most elegant that ever was seen, is 400 feet high. The western facade, very richly ornamented, MARKET PLalCE (SALISBURY). is flanked by two massive square towers surmounted by pinnacles. Salisbury Cathedral is chiefly interesting from its exterior aspect ; the interior is far from being so majestic and so harmonious; nevertheless, the nave is a beautiful structure, a little cold, perhaps, and would be improved in this respect if the light, which is admitted by numerous windows, was tempered by the introduction of stained glass. The cloisters, which are of a period subsequent to the cathedral, are of a more florid 61"], [272, "THE PROVINCES. 260 style, and present a beautiful series of arcades with elegant windows and decorations of great richness. Salisbury possesses numerous buildings, erected in the Middle Ages, such as the house of John Halle, in which the great hall is ornamented with wood carvings of great artistic value, Joiners' Hall, the elegant fa9ade of which dates from the reign of Elizabeth, and Tailors' Hall. Lastly, in the Poultry Market is a beautiful hexagonal cross of the time of Edward IV. From Southampton, whither we return quickly by the railroad, we shall continue our \u00a3xcursion; but first, we must say a few words concerning the Channel Islands, which are in regular and direct communication by steamer with Southampton. The passage is one of the most disagreeable it is possible to make, if the wind happens to be blowing, or the sea is a little rough ; in winter and in foggy weather it is very dangerous, because of the girdle of rocks just flush with the water, and the currents which hurry vessels towards them. The Channel Islands in clude the two bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey. To the latter are affiliated the small islands of Alderney (Aurigny) , Sark, and Herm. Without being colonies in the strict sense of the word, they are, RUINS OF MONT ORGUEIL (JERSEY). nevertheless, not considered as forming part of the territory of the United Kingdom, but they are dependent on the Crown, and are the only portions of the ancient Duchy of Normandy now belonging to England. They have a superficial extent of 73 square mdes, arid their population which, in 1871, was 90,500, in 1884 only amounted to 87,000. For administrative purposes the islands are placed under the direction of a lieutenant governor, who represents the Queen ; they have a Parliament, called \" the States,\" and a tribunal denominated the Royal Court. The members of \" the States \" in Jersey number fifty-two, and thirty-seven in Guernsey. The official language of \" the States \" and of the Tribunals is French ; the well-to-do classes speak English, and the people express themselves in a Norman patois, which is changing its character by degrees in consequence of the introduction of English words, and which will end by disappearing altogether. As a rule, everybody in the islands understands and speaks both French and English. There are no import duties levied in the islands, and the consequence is living is cheaper there than in England and France. But compulsory service is retained ; every citizen between the ages of sixteen and sixty-five being liable to serve. Nominally, the militia number 15,000 men, but there are only 1,000 under arms. There is stationed in Jersey an English infantry regiment, and in Guernsey a battery of artillery."], [273, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 261 For ecclesiastical purposes, Jersey and Guernsey are included in the diocese of Winchester. The climate being very equable and of exceptional mildness, the islands are, in ELIZABETH CASTLE (JERSEY). winter, the resort of a number of invalids, and, at all seasons, of a large number of retired officers and other functionaries who form what is termed the \" society.\" The inhabitants, being excedent farmers, have succeeded in obtaining splendid"], [274, "THE PROVINCES. 262 crops, and the islands have become very rich agricultural districts. Fruits and corn are chiefly raised. Jersey boasts a race of very celebrated milch cows, and, with a view of keeping their breed pure, the importation of cattle is rigorously interdicted. Industry is little developed; it consists in the fishing; and at Guernsey in the quarrying of stone, which is very valuable for paving the streets. The two principal islands export great quantities of fruit to England, particularly apples, pears, grapes, and potatoes. The exports, in 1882, attained the value oi \u00a3849,000, and the imports of English and foreign products amounted to \u00a3787,480, which shows a very favour able condition of affairs, since the exports exceed the imports. VIEW OF ST. PETER PORT (GUERNSEY). Jersey, the largest ofthe islands, is the nearest to France; the country is undulating and the northern portion of it encloses a chain of hills, which descend with gentle slope, southwards. Small watercourses wind through the miniature valleys, and the central part, well wooded, is intersected by good shady roads bordered by green hedges. The southern coast bristles with formidable rocks, which render access to the harbours difficult. Jersey is unquestionably one of the most picturesque places in Europe; nevertheless, on arrival, the appearance of St. Helier's is not prepossessing. We have to traverse, first of all, small narrow streets, which produce by no means a favourable impression on"], [275, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 263 strangers But soon clean and well-paved thoroughfares, lined with houses, and gay with handsome shops succeed to the narrow alleys. The dwelling-houses between two gardens nearly all possess a greenhouse; hydrangeas, camelias, and particularly geraniums flourish m winter, as they do at Gibraltar or Malaga; the magnolia here assumes the proportions of a tree, and the myrtle climbs up the houses, frames the doors and windows, and even clings to the chimney-pots. St. Helier's is a smad provincial town, which possesses no monument, either ancient or modern, worth mentioning, except Fort Regent, which stands on a rocky eminence ST. PETER PORT (GUERNSEY). to the east of the harbour, to which Castle Elizabeth, budt on an isolated rock, but accessible by a causeway at low water, is the counterpart. Close by is a ruin called a \" hermitage,\" a sort of cell, formerly inhabited, tradition says, by St. Helier himself. In the neighbourhood of the town are two beautiful valleys \u2014 Val des Vaux and Grand Val. The former, four or five miles in length, is watered by a small stream, on which many mills are situated. We perceive also a modern tower, built upon a hill, which is believed to be an ancient tumulus. From the top of the tower we can see the greater portion of Jersey, the country unrolling itself in graceful undulations. Grouville Bay, to the east of St. Helier's, is truly picturesque. On it stands the little fishing-vdlage of Gorey, and at the northern extremity of the bay, on a granite promontory, uprise the imposing ruins of Mont Orgueil. Surrounded on three sides by the sea, united to the island by a narrow tongue of land, and defended by fortifications"], [276, "THE PROVINCES. 264 hewn in the rock, this ancient fortress presents a formidable appearance. It is said that certain portions of Mont Orgueil were built in the time of Julius C\u00e6sar. In the reign of King John it was a place of considerable importance, and Charles II. when he sought refuge in Jersey was lodged there in apartments which are stdl shown. The most curious portions of the castle, besides these apartments, are the wells, which date from wire Roman Bruins the Guernsey, twenty - five miles to the north-west of Jersey, is the chief of many rocky islands, or islets, which are separated by shallow little straits. This island, which is highest in the southern part, falls away in a northerly direction; while the south coast is abrupt and inacces sible. There are no hills, but Guernsey, like Jersey, is divided by little vadeys. It is less wooded than its rival, and decidedly less picturesque, although presenting many views of wild grandeur in certain districts. With re spect to administration, law, commerce, and industry, what we have said about Jersey will apply equally to Guernsey. The principal town is St. Peter Port, the houses of which are scattered along the sea-coast for about a mile. The only interesting edifice prince's tower and corbiere rocks (jersey). is the parish church, a beautiful monument of the ornate Gothic style Besides the somewhat irregularly-built High Street, St. Peter Port possesses two fine thoroughfares, Grange Road and Hauteville, separated by a deep ravine. In this latter street, which is situated, as its name denotes, in the highest portion of the town, is Hauteville House, which was, during many years of exile, thc residence of the greatest French poet of the century, Victor Hugo. Everyone has read Les Travailleurs de la Mer, and the admirable descriptions of Guernsey, written by the author of Les Chdtiments, so we shall not presume to attempt to depict any of the remarkable sites of this island. Opposite St. Peter Port are the smaU islands of Herm and Jethou. The former,"], [277, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 265 belonging to a private individual, was purchased by the monks ofthe Grande Chartreuse at the time of the execution of the decrees against religious communities, and was resold by them in 1884. Sark, a little to the south of Herm, is a rocky island in two parts, Great Sark and Little Sark, connected by la Coupie, a long and very narrow ridge, 300 feet high, perpendicular on each side, along which a road has been made The caverns of Sark are celebrated, as well as the enormous pyramidical rocks caded the Autelets (little altars). Alderney, more thickly peopled than Sark, is ready an advanced fortress of England, for it bristles with forts and batteries which extend over a length of five miles. \" It is to this harbour that our merchant ships would look for safety in the event of war. It EXETER CATHEDRAL. is here that gunboats and other ships of war would collect; to this place they would repair for coals and stores ; here they might refit ; and hence they might issue to cut off and destroy an enemy stationed at Cherbourg.\" So says an English author whom we have quoted word for word. However, for one reason or another, Alderney has been made a considerable port of refuge, and \u00a31,000,000 sterling has already been expended on its works. Let us now return to the south coast of England. The portion of Hampshire included between Southampton water, the Solent, and Dorsetshire is entirely occupied by the New Forest. In English the word forest has not the same signification as the French word foret. According to English law and custom, a forest is an extent of wooded land, belonging to the sovereign, and reserved to him as a hunting ground, and moreover guarded and protected by special laws, the execution of which is confided to functionaries specially appointed for the purpose. This interesting forest is about the size of the Isle of Wight, that is to say, 66,000 acres in extent, of which about 14,000 are pasture land."], [278, "THE PROVINCES. 266 Just on the borders of Hampshire and Dorsetshire, at the end of the Bay of Poole, we find the pretty little town of Bournemouth, well sheltered from cold winds, which in consequence of its mild and equable climate, is a winter watering-place, and a renowned bathing resort. A little farther on is Weymouth, which George III. loved to visit, and where he built a house, now a hotel. Alongside of the old quarter, a new town has been built, and is now much frequented in summer by bathers and tourists, for Weymouth has become a packet station of some importance, and is in direct and regular communication with the Channel Islands and Cherbourg. A narrow natural causeway unites Weymouth to the peninsula of Portland, which is only an enormous rocky promontory, bounded on all sides by precipitous cliffs. A semicircular breakwater forms with this road a harbour of refuge of great importance. The works, commenced in 1847 and finished a few years ago, cost \u00a31,000,000 sterling, and were executed, as well as the fortifications with which the island bristles, by the convicts. Devonshire forms, with Cornwall, the peninsula which separates the Bristol Channel from the English Channel, and is the extreme south-west portion of England. We may divide it into two parts, North and South, which are also the electoral divisions. The inhabitants love to call their county the garden of England ; this name, we have already seen, is bestowed upon Kent. Devonshire, a very hilly, rocky, marshy, desert, and desolate county throughout a great portion of its extent, presents, never theless many fertile districts, particularly in the south, which is washed by the waters of the Channel. Exeter, the chief town of the county is a very ancient city, budt upon the left bank of the Exe, on the sides of a steep hill. Its foundation has been attributed to various primitive tribes, but we do not know exactly to what period its history goes back. The ancient Britons called it Caenvise, the Romans Jsca. Isca became Exanceaster, which ended by being contracted to Exeter, the city on the Exe. It was formerly an important fortress, and sustained long sieges, particularly at the time of the Norman Conquest ; under Henry VIII., during the Wars of the Roses ; and in the Parliamentary Civil War. Considering its ancient origin, Exeter has very few interesting monuments ; however, a few traces of its castle and of its walls exist, but one expects better things from the Queen ofthe West, and the capital of the West Saxons. We need scarcely say that the cathedral is, par excellence, the monument of Exeter. It occupies the site of an ancient church, commenced by Bishop Warelwast, nephew of William the Conqueror, and of which now nothing remains but the towers, standing on each side of the present church, which was erected in the 14th century. Built in the form of a cross, the church has a perfect regularity and unity of style that are very rare. It is one of the most remarkable and best preserved specimens of the florid Gothic. It consists of a nave and choir with aisles. The nave and choir are of the same length, and, from inside, make its proportions appear enormous ; but, from an exterior point of view, the church appears heavy and disproportioned. The two towers on each"], [279, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 267 side of the cathedral, where the choir and the nave meet, serve as transepts ; it is probable that they formed a part of the facade of the primitive church. TOWN HALL (ESETEK The interior, which is of great length, is very beautiful. The nave and choir, as well as the chapels, are admirable, particularly by their richness, delicacy, and finish. 62"], [280, "THE PROVINCES. 268 The windows are filled with beautiful stained glass. The wood carvings are most artistically executed, as also are the corbels between the arches, and the bosses of the roof, the leafy decoration of which, enhanced by colouring, is excessively beautiful. After the cathedral, the oldest building in Exeter is the Town Hall, the front of which consists of an arcade supported by massive pillars, above which open wide windows, separated by coupled columns, the whole crowned by a balustrade. This picturesque monument, dating from the 15th century, has been compared, with due regard to relative proportions, to the Hotel de Ville, of Cologne. The south coast of Devonshire, from the mouth of the Exe to Plymouth, is dotted by numerous watering-places, of which the principal are Dawlish, picturesquely situated at the mouth of a small stream which emerges from a green valley ; Teignmouth, at the mouth of the Teign, which is crossed by a curious wooden bridge of thirty -four arches, 1,672 feet long; and, most important of all, Torquay, which is to this part of England what Brighton is to the south, and Scarborough to the eastern coast, that is to say, the watering-place par excellence. Torquay is charmingly situated at the end of a beautiful bay. At the commencement of this century it was only a fishing hamlet. The mildness of the climate, and the beauty of its neighbourhood attracted tourists, and gradually Torquay be- EDDYSTONE LIGHTHOUSE. came the fashion. The town is built on the side of a hill, and on the summit of a cliff. The white houses surrounded by trees, and pretty lawns, soft as velvet, stand out from the background of cliff which they so gaily climb, and have a cheerful aspect, which is very characteristic. This flourishing little town is rather composed of isolated villas than of streets, the houses having been built irregularly and with a charming disorder whicli is almost artistic. Anstis Bay, situated on the other side of the promontory on which Torquay is built, is both charming and picturesque, the verdure descending almost to the pebbly beach which underlies the high chalky cliffs. Opposite Torquay, on the other horn of the crescent which the bay forms, we find the little town of Brixham, celebrated in history by the landing of the Prince of Orange there, on the Sth November, 1688, an incident which is recalled by an obelisk erected in the market place. A few miles to the south of Brixham is the picturesque town of Dartmouth, whose old 17th century houses, curiously ornamented with turrets and pinnacles, gables, and overhanging storeys are rapidly disappearing to make room for modern buildings, while the narrow and tortuous streets are being replaced by wide aud straight roads, into"], [281, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 269 SiX^1\" PiCtUreSqU6neSS \"* * \u00ab\" \"*\u00ab* of All the coast of South Devon from Dartmouth to Plymouth is broken into bays and Forest \"^ nUmer\u00b0US waterwurses which have their sources in Dartmoor Dartmoor, which has been called the mother of rivers, is au immense plateau, desolate and wild, nearly circular, some twenty miles in diameter, in which rise ru-ed peaks called tors. It is the most elevated portion of the granite chain which separates DARTMOUTH. Cornwall into two almost equal parts, the last peaks of which, after dipping under the sea, rise again to form the Scilly Isles off the Land's End. We need the pencil of a Salvator Rosa to reproduce the gruesome and terrible aspect of this vast solitude of 125,000 acres of uncultivated land, upon which grows nothing but coarse grass, gorse, and moss. Before quitting South Devon we must not forget that on the borders of the county is situated Plymouth, or rather the three united towns of Plymouth, Stonehouse, and Devonport, forming a collection of docks, dockyards, barracks, and fortifications, which we may consider as constituting one of the strongest of the fortified places in the United Kingdom. Built at the end of a vast roadstead, which is itself cut into five harbours, the three towns \u2014 Plymouth, to the east, on the borders of Catwater, the estuary of the river Plym; Devonport, to the west at the mouth of the Tamar; aud Stonehouse, which stands between the two \u2014 form really but one town. The oldest is Plymouth, the Tamara of -the Romans, which, as early as the 13th century, was a considerable port, from which a fleet of 300 vessels put to sea under the"], [282, "THE PROVINCES. 270 command of the Earl of Lancaster for Bordeaux. In 1355 the Black Prince embarked at Plymouth at the opening of the campaign which terminated in the Battle of Poitiers. After the discovery of America the town extended greatly, and from it sailed the May Flower with 101 Puritans who, in 1608, went to colonise Massachusetts; but the true development of Plymouth dates from the end of the last and the beginning of the present century, at the time of the French war. It is from the top of the Hoe, a sort of promontory, which overlooks the port, and which has been made into an agreeable promenade, that we get the best idea of Plymouth, and of the importance of its harbour and fortifications. We have there before us the magnificent roadstead whose boundaries are clearly marked, and which is protected by an immense breakwater constructed by Rennie. On the left the citadel dots the promontory with its bastions; and on all sides are docks with an uninterrupted series of basins. On the right, Stonehouse forms a kind of peninsula; and, farther off, on the other side of Stonehouse Lake, extends the vast dockyard of Devonport, which only yields to that of Portsmouth in importance. The three towns are protected by a chain of forts, the arrangement of which resembles the system of defence estab lished in the neighbourhood of Ports mouth. The dockyard, in which nearly 5,000 men are employed, is not EXMOOR. materially different from those of Chatham and Portsmouth, and has no interest, except for people who have not already seen the other dockyards. Opposite Plymouth, about fifteen miles south-west, rises the Eddystone Light house, recently erected at some distance from Smeaton's beacon, which now stands on the Hoe. The new lighthouse, which does great credit to modern architecture, is higher than the old one. It is to be hoped that it will be found as capable of resisting the assaults of the waves as was Smeaton's lighthouse, which has been removed, not because it was giving way in itself, but because the sea had undermined the rock upon which it was built. The new lighthouse, which cost \u00a3100,000, is about 155 feet high. Plymouth has given birth to a number of eminent men, and particularly to artists, amongst whom we may mention Haydon, Prout, Cook, Northcott, Eastlake, and Sir Joshua Reynolds. The north coast of Devonshire is less widely developed than the south, and it is also less interesting. It has, nevertheless, its own beauties and charms, its flowery meads, and desolate moor."], [283, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 271 uncult v t a 7Z 7T f there \"* \" DeV\u00b0nshlse tW0 imm\u2014 tracts of uncultivated land, which still preserve their primitive aspect, and which have remained, so to speak, unchanged since the periods when the ancient Britons, the Danes, and the Romans overran Great Britain. On the south is Dartmoor; on the north lies Exmoor, each composed of a series of sombre heights, intersected by desert vadeys, watered by numerous little streams. The latter moorland, which contains about 20,000 acres is intersected by deep and picturesquely-wooded ravines; it formerly contained the Royal torest of Exmoor, recently converted into grazing lands. The heights of Exmoor, covered with gorse and wild shrubs, are (with the exception PLYMOUTH BREAKWATER AND FORT. of the Scottish Highlands) , the only places in Great Britain in which the red deer is seen in a wild state, and in which the little horses called Exmoor ponies are found ; those ponies are of the English breed, in all its pristine purity. So the hunting-men of Devon and Somerset devote themselves for six weeks every year to hunting the stag, an amusement in regard to which the English are rather fanatical, and which on Exmoor assumes quite an original aspect. Very different indeed is the hunting of a wild deer from the pursuit of a tame animal turned out of the \" cart,\" and permitted to run through a country with which it is unfamiliar. As soon as we have crossed Exmoor, we come upon the Bristol Channel again, on the other side of which is Wales. Ilfracombe, almost opposite to Swansea, is a picturesque town, and the most celebrated watering place in North Devon. Originally a mere fishing village, Ilfracombe has developed rapidly ; new houses, villas, hotels, have risen up as by enchantment; the railroad has penetrated thither; aud now-a-days it is"], [284, "THE PROVINCES. 272 as expensive a place as any other, and that is, as we all know, the acme of civilisation and of the modern mode. From Ilfracombe steamboats ply along the coast as far as Barnstaple and Clovelly. Bideford has nothing to interest one.; but it is far otherwise with Clovelly\u2014 one of the most curious vdlages in England, situated at the southern extremity of Bideford Bay. Nestling at the foot of a wooded hill, Clovelly is composed of one narrow street, so steep that steps have been made in the roadway. On each side of this street, which is a staircase, or of this staircase which is a street, are houses in tiers, each house rising higher than its neighbour. And what charming little subjects they are for the artist, with their wooden balconies, their projecting windows, their galleries and terraces! They cannot be described\u2014 the pencd only can do them justice. At the lower end of the street, which reminds one of the narrow alleys of Mont St. Michel, is the harbour, where the fishing-boats land the herrings they have captured during the night; for Clovelly is celebrated for its herring fishery, which is the principal industry of the inhabitants. The duchy of Cornwall, being a continuation in a south-westerly direction of Devonshire, offers very nearly the same geological and climatic characteristics as the latter county. However, if the climate is more temperate there in consequence of the vicinity of the Gulf Stream, there is more rain there, too ; and the district, without being unhealthy, is somewhat too damp. LYNMOUTH. Very rich in minerals, Cornwall contains tin and copper mines of considerable value, although inferior to what they were in former days. The cost of production has become too great to keep up with foreign competition any longer. The fishery for a particular species of herring called the pilchard employs a large number of the coast population. The large fish are salted like herrings, and the small ones are sent to Italy, where they are converted to sardines ! The coast of Cornwall bristles with dangerous rocks, but they give it a picturesque appearance nevertheless. The Lizard \u2014 the extreme south point of England \u2014 is the most interesting part of this coast. It is cut into numerous little bays called coves, which are narrow valleys, descending to the very margin of the sea between the granite cliffs. The most celebrated are Mullion Cove and Kynance Cove, in which are found the veins of Serpentine, the sheen of which gives a peculiar charm to the rocks which it seams in all directions. At the"], [285, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 273 extreme end of the Lizard Point are two fine lighthouses, built in 1792, whose lanterns are 186 feet above the level of the sea, which here is constantly agitated, and breaks with fury against the rocks on which the lighthouses are built. Besides its natural curiosities, the county of Cornwall is the richest in England in pre-historic antiquities. The cromlechs, the Druidical stones, and menhirs are very common ; there is scarcely a place where they are not to be found. We also come upon villages consisting of clay huts, a sort of hive, which were inhabited by the ancient tribes in Cornwall. These villages were oval, and presented exteriorly an appearance of a continuous wall of earth, pierced by a single opening. The interior showed a species of court from which all the huts opened. These villages were therefore, at the same time, at once habitations and fortresses. Few districts are so interesting from an arch\u00e6ological point of view as the Duchy, and KTNANCE COVE. antiquaries do not fail to explore it in every direction. To the west of the Lizard, the coast, on which we do not find, so to speak, one important village, forms a semi circular bay \u2014 on that bay is built the town of Penzance. Penzance, picturesquely situated on Mount's Bay, is the last town we come to before reaching the extreme western point of England, called the Land's End. The town contains 12,000 inhabitants, its streets are irregular, the houses standing apart, and there are no monuments, for the Town Hall and Market cannot be so designated. The statue of Sir Humphrey Davy, the inventor of the Safety Lamp, adorns one of the empty spaces of Penzance, which had the honour of giving birth to him. From the"], [286, "THE PROVINCES. 274 Esplanade, which is the only promenade in the town, we enjoy a beautiful view over the harbour, formed by two piers, and over the bay, from the midst of which rises St. Michael's Mount, a gigantic block of granite, the base of which is occupied by a small fishing village, while its summit is crowned by a castle and a church, as on Mont St. Michel, in Normandy, but of smaller proportions. This is the great attraction of Penzance. According to local tradition, the giant Cormoran\u2014 a legendary personage\u2014 CLOVELLT. I had built a fortress on this rock, on which the arch angel, Saint Michael, appeared to a hermit some centuries later. The monks of the Norman St. Michael's Mount established here in the llth century a jpriory, which became independent. After the conquest, William I. sent thither his brother Robert, Count of Mortain, who built a fortress there, but the abbey survived the castle. Under Edward III. the Benedictine Monks were replaced by nuns, and in 1660 St. Michael's Mount was sold to the St. Aubyn family, to whom it still belongs. We can reach the mount by a causeway, 400 yards long, which is dry at low water. When the tide is up, we must cross in a boat. We land in the small harbour of the village which is at the foot of the mount, and to reach the castle we must follow a narrow zig-zag path cut in the granite. The mountain falls away in abrupt slopes from a height of 195 feet, and is crowned by the"], [287, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 275 eastie, which is inhabited in summer by Sir J. St. Aubyn. The most remarkable portions of it are the refectory, now the hall, and the chapel, the tower of which, the most ancient part of the whole edifice, is 250 feet above the seashore. From the summit of this tower, the view over land and sea is of great beauty. At an angle of the platform we find the chair of St. Michael, which possesses the property of conferring the manage ment of the household upon the husbands or wives who first seat themselves therein This chair is simply an ancient cresset fixed in a place into which it is dangerous to climb. So the imagination of the good people of Cornwall hastened to build a superstition upon it. Penzance is the centre of an agricultural and mining district, while the pilchard and mackerel.fisheries employ about 2,000 men. The farmers in the neighbourhood devote them selves principally to the cultiva tion of early fruits and veget ables for the London market, the mildness of the climate rendering this an easy matter. The mineral riches of the county consist in its numerous tin mines : the chief ones are those of Botallack, the galleries of which extend 400 feet under the sea, Wheal Owles and Ding Dong, which furnish 300 or 400 tons of metal annually. Amongst the numerous excursions to be made in the neighbourhood of Penzance, after seeing St. Michael's Mount and the mines, we may mention St. Ives' Bay and the Land's End, a mass of granite disinte grated by the waves, forming a series of needles, peaks, rounded rocks and natural CLOVELLY STREET. arches, presenting the most curious forms, and of the most imposing aspect, against which the Atlantic rollers dash fiercely, and, breaking into foam, retire in a silvery rain. Not far from here is found thc Logan or Rocking Stone; and at every step we come across cromlechs and Druidic stones, like those of Brittany, with which the Duchy of Cornwall has more than one point of resemblance. The manners of the inhabitants, their language and superstitions, indicate their common origin with the race who peopled the ancient Armorica. From Penzance we can reach the Scilly islands, a group of about 300 islets or 63"], [288, "THE PROVINCES. 276 rocks, five only of which are inhabited. These islands \u2014 called by the Greeks Cassiterides, and by the Romans Sillin\u0153\u2014have formed part of the Duchy of Cornwall from time immemorial, and have a total population of 2,500. Almost all the inhabitants are employed in fishing, which is the only industry of the Scilly Islands, although for the last few years, under the impulse exercised by the proprietor, PENZANCE. Mr. Dorrien Smith, they are beginning to devote themselves to the cultivation of the ground. It is about four hours steaming from Penzance to St. Mary, the largest island of the group, in which is Star Castle, erected in the reign of Elizabeth, and which owes its name to the arrangement of its eight bastions. The island of Tresco, which we reach afterwards, is inhabited by the lord of the isles, whose house is built on the site of an ancient abbey, founded in the 10th century, the walls of which, covered with flowers, still remain. Vegetation is very luxuriant here, and in the park surrounding the house, we find geraniums growing to the height of fifteen feet. All these islands are formed of blocks of rock which are the last summits of the mountain chain that starts from Dartmoor, and, like a dorsal fin of granite, divides Cornwall into two They are remarkable for the picturesque confusion with which they are scattered and for their fantastic forms. Unfortunately, these pretty islands are a"], [289, "THE SEA COAST AND THE SEA PORTS. 277 standing danger to navigation, and, notwithstanding the gleams of the lighthouses, a great number of vessels are wrecked there in stormy weather. We have now seen that so far as its beauty and the diversity of its landscapes are ST. MICHAEL'S MOUNT. concerned, England has no reason to be jealous of other countries. Its coasts present a series of delightful watering-places; and the different districts of the midland and western counties, Cornwall and Wales in particular, present an infinite series of charming landscapes. Mountains, lakes, forests, regions wild and de serted, fertile and well peopled, cul tivated or uncultivated, nothing is wanting in it which is needed to make a country interesting to ex plore and agreeable to live iD. Never theless, this country, picturesque as it is, is very little known to foreigners, who are charmed by its natural beauties, no doubt, but who fear, and not without reason, that they will not find in it the distractions and amuse ments which are offered to visitors in those places on the continent to which it is the fashion to resort every summer.
