CHAPTER I. \" There is a history in all men's lives Figuring the nature of the times deceased ; Tlie which observed, a man may prophesy, With a near aim, of the main chance of things As yet not come to life.\" Shakspebe. f^lAESON BEOCKENHAET, the vicar of BJ-Sgil IVIarsh-under-Cliff, was, despite a reputation for book-learning, and a look about the eyes that carried with it suggestions of midnight oil, a happy- looking man with a fresh colour and a very fair capacity for enjoyment. He was, in truth, the fortunate possessor of a gift which Dame Nature will sometimes bestow, in rarely effusive moments, upon the poor gentleman \u2014 a sanguine tempera- ment ; thanks to which, he could muster, save in moments of profound depression, such a breadth of hopefulness as enables a man to find bright spots even in a long butcher's bill, and even to write a cheque for it (despite an overdrawn banker's account) without turning a hair."], [10, "2 A PARSON AT BAY. This sanguine parson never looked happier than when he was driving about, in a newly purchased dogcart, a beautiful girl of less than half his age whom he had made his wife some few months before this story begins. The cart was a decent sort of vehicle which an acquaintance had parted with at a low price \u2014 doubtless out of sheer good nature. The cob which drew it, however, was a nondescript sort of animal, very thick in the legs, and having a slouching action that seemed hardly compatible with its pedigree, as described by its late owner \u2014 another good-natured friend. Still, a conveyance of some kind was more or less a necessity to a conscientious parson with a wide parish ; and, with out it, his charming young bride would have been condemned to the rustic seclusion of Marsh-under- Cliff. Moreover the whole neighbourhood had called upon her, and to return all these visits in hired conveyances would have been a ruinous ex pense. It was far wiser to purchase a trap outright ; and, of course, it must needs be a respectable one. Mr. Brockenhart felt a qualm or two at the price. but fully intended to economize in other directions. He salved his conscience, to begin with, by refusing a smart roan mare upon which he had set his heart, and purchasing the hulking cob aforesaid. Even as it was the trap was not half good enough for that dainty little bride of his, who was, artisti cally speaking, one of those pictures that demand good framing. She had a cleft -cherry mouth, rich"], [11, "A PARSON AT BAY. 3 blue eyes darkened by black lashes, and a figure which it would have been sacrilege to hand over to a second-rate dressmaker. She was so small, so youthful, so innocent-looking, that it was difficult to think of her as a married woman. Yet Maisie Brockenhart was not only a wife, but a stepmother as well \u2014 and the whole neighbourhood laughed at this thing. Maisie's little stepdaughter was now about four years old, and almost as charming, people said, as herself. When Mrs. Brockenhart first drove round the district to work out her daily quantum of return visits, little Charmian, as she was called, not only occupied a seat in the cart, but was taken indoors to be admired and made much of at every house where the family was worth impressing. The child had pretty manners as well as a pretty face, and her stepmother seemed to delight in showing her off to advantage. \" The carthorse and the shabby parson are kept in the background,\" \u2014 so said Miss Crackanthorpe of Bavant Grange, who was an old maid and privi leged cynic \u2014 \"and the charming bride brings her in just as she would a smart parasol or a handsome dust-cloak.\" On the afternoon of our first making their acquaintance, however, Mr. and Mrs. Brockenhart and the child were not upon a calling expedition, but driving from the seaside vicarage to attend a large garden-party at Bavant Castle. They had five miles to traverse, the Castle being"], [12, "A PARSON AT BAY. 4 on the outskirts of the market town of South Bavant, and Charmian began the journey by prat tling her hardest. She explained that she was going to a kind of tarpy called an \" At Home ; \" that she had a new frock on in which she looked very nice ; that she was going to play \" molberry bush \" with all the girls and little boys, and that daddy must hold her hand all the time 'cept when he was playing bowls \u2014 in fact, she went through a careful and exhaustive programme of the coming entertainment. The parson listened with a smile not unlike a mother's. He had been father and mother both to the child for the last three years, whence the relation between them had come to be of a close and special kind. He was a very human sort of man, though not a very strong one ; and, being troubled with something like a woman's tenderness of heart, and with it a correlative womanly liking for sympathy, he had of late fallen quite uncon sciously into the way of turning to little Charmian for the satisfaction of this craving ; and so habit had developed the sympathetic faculty originally bestowed upon her by nature. Yet, to-day, Mr. Brockenhart's mood was not so reflective of his child's as usual ; he was somewhat gloomy and silent for so sanguine a man, and his wife happened to be busy with a problem of her own. Charmian, however, had spirits enough to furnish the party, though her desires were presently to take a sudden and bewildering change of direction."], [13, "A PARSON AT BAY. 5 For after mounting a hill about a mile distant from home, they came in sight of a long reach of the river, whereupon the distant party became a thing of naught and a row on the water the central object of her existence. \" Oh, daddy,\" she cried fervently, \" I don't care for the silly old tarpy \u2014 do take me on the water instead ? Perhaps there'll be water-lilies and 'get-me-nots, if we look very hard for them ? \" \" Bless the child ! \" cried the parson, startled out of a reverie, \" we can't throw up engagements in that casual fashion. You don't yet appreciate the solemnity and importance of social obligations, little woman.\" \" If you really were inclined for the river, Claud,\" suggested the little bride, \" I dare say I could make your apologies at the Castle. And in passing through Bavant we are almost sure to meet with some one good-natured enough to take charge of me.\" \" No, no, my dear love,\" he cried hastily, feeling compunctious about his late silence, \" I couldn't be so shabby as to desert you. Of course I must share the society stone-breaking, just as you do the parish bothers.\" The cleft-cherry lips closed again, and no more was said for the present. The parson drove on, with his driving hand, shockingly gloved, stretched forward as usual. He was not a graceful whip, and his wife did sometimes yearn to see him in a new pair of gloves."], [14, "6 A PARSON AT BAY. When they reached the cross roads, which made the halfway point in their journey to South Bavant, a little incident occurred. There were thick pheasant coverts on both sides of them at this point, and a keeper's cottage stood on the near side of the road, separated from it by a neat garden. The keeper, a brawny fellow named Wilkins, whose temper, thanks to night poachers out of doors and a scolding wife within, had lost much of its sweetness, was standing beside a row of kidney beans, flogging the youngest of his long family of daughters with a heavy strap. The child, who looked a year or two older than Charmian, was undergoing the operation with the fortitude of long habit. Yet Parson Brockenhart, catching sight of the pair as he came abreast of the wicket gate, flushed a warm red and flung down his reins. The cob stopped of its own accord, with a faint snort of satisfaction. Charmian clutched her father by the shoulder, crying, \"Oh, he's beatin' her \u2014 don't let him any more, daddy ! \" Mrs. Brockenhart exclaimed earnestly, \"I do entreat you not to interfere, Claud. Surely it is no business of ours ? Lord Bavant can look after his own keepers, and will certainly resent \" But Claud was already on his feet, and snatching open the wicket with an angry jerk. \" Look here, Wilkins,\" he called out, rather hotly for a quiet parson, \" what has the child been doing ? \""], [15, "A PARSON AT BAY. 7 \" Mind your own business, and be d \u2014 d to 'ee ! \" shouted Wilkins, with an ugly twist of his lips and a fresh shower of blows. The prospect of a rescue seemed to spoil little Jane Wilkins's fortitude ; she now began to whimper and scream her hardest. \" I'm not going to stand it ! \" cried the parson, advancing a step or two. \" Ain't you, mister ? \" jeered Wilkins, and with that gave his daughter a cuff on the head which knocked her down upon a heap of bean-sticks. Claud Brockenhart, when a Rugby boy, had been noted for sudden bursts of temper, which generally preceded blows, and were always followed by a hot desire to make it up again with the offending party. He was a Rugby boy again now, for the nonce. By a deft wriggle of his shoulders he got rid of a few inches of his black coat ; then recollected himself, and paused. Wilkins retorted by tucking up his sleeves, drawing a step or two clear of the kidney beans, and taunting his foe like a Greek hero, though in words of fewer syllables. But the over-hasty pair were checked, when within a couple of yards of one another, by the appearance of a second dogcart at the gate. This was a much more showy turn-out than the parson's, and contained Lord Bavant and his youngest brother, Captain Aubrey. \" What the deuce is the matter here ? \" shouted the former, leaping to the ground."], [16, "A PARSON AT BAY. 8 \"Apparently a set-to between a parson and a keeper,\" explained the other coolly. \" I'll give you three to one in fives against the parson. But if you want to stop the shindy you'd better knock him down and sit on his head.\" As he spoke, however, Captain Aubrey caught sight of the flushed face of the parson's little bride, whereupon, with a hasty lift of his hat, he drove up close to her, saying \u2014 \" I beg your pardon \u2014 you must be Mrs. Brocken hart. Pray forgive my foolish joke ;. and, see, my brother is standing between them now \u2014 there is nothing more to fear.\" Captain Aubrey's penitence deepened as the little bride's beauty impressed itself more fully upon him. Though only lately arrived in the neighbourhood, he had heard a good deal of this newly imported little gem, but some kinds of beauty strike home as no previous description of them can do, and make ex pectation feel that, for once in a way, it has pitched itself in too low a key. The little woman was really in need of consolation, though perhaps not so alarmed as she seemed. Lord Bavant was the most important person in her husband's parish, the patron of that and many other livings, to offend whom were the very acme of bad policy ; and what must he tliink of a clergyman who is found on the verge of fisticuffs with a common man in a cottage garden ? As it happened, the earl had at first no oppor tunity of expressing his views on this head. To"], [17, "A PARSON AT BAY. 9 begin with, Jane Wilkins lay in a dead faint on the bean-sticks, and had to be revived. When this was safely accomplished, and the child enabled to sit up, Mrs. Wilkins came hurtling down the path from the cottage, and gave the keeper such a rating as neither peer nor commoner could hope to improve upon. While this was proceeding, Lord Bavant looked at his watch as though to time the performance, which disconcerted the scold more than any rebuke could have done. \" I had a word or two to say to your husband myself, Mrs. Wilkins,\" he remarked, after a second glance at his watch, \" but don't let me hurry you \" \" I suppose I'll lose my place, my lord,\" muttered the keeper, sullenly, \" but that aggravatin' woman was curlin' her tongue round me all dinner-time, and so mayhap I was over-ready to fly out at Janey ; and then the vicar came interferin' \" \" I \u2014 I'm going to beg Lord Bavant to keep you on,\" murmured the parson, who looked pale and miserable enough. \" If you were to belt that woman occasionally instead of your little daughter,\" growled the peer, \" there would be little to complain of.\" \"Pray don't teach him that lesson,\" said Mr. Brockenhart, deprecatingly ; \" let him rather learn to curb his temper, and live at peace with his wife.\" \"You'll find yourn wants belting one o' these days, I reckon,\" Wilkins muttered, under his breath."], [18, "10 A PARSON AT BAY. \"And I assure you he's a good fellow, though over hasty, like \u2014 like the vicar of his parish.\" Mr. Brockenhart made the confession with a dim sort of smile. \" He's a good sort, s'elp me Bob ! \" reflected the keeper, \" but a deal too soft-hearted for a pore parson that's got to make his way in the world.\" \"You can go now, Wilkins,\" said his lordship shortly, \" and next time you have occasion to strap one of your family, choose the right member, and do it behind the house.\" Wilkins departed with a grateful touch of his hat, and the peer turned to have a word or two with the parson. The earl was an immense bush-bearded man; massively blunt of speech as well as big-framed ; he was also a severe, though just, master, who seldom found any difficulty in speaking his mind to gentle or simple, but somehow he could not find just the words that he wanted at this moment. He perceived that the vicar was not thinking of him, but trying to balance up the right and wrong of his own conduct. He seemed to have made a fool of himself ; yet, after all, was it better to be a coward than a fool? Would he be feeling any better at this moment if he had driven past and left little Jane to her fate ? The vicar was tall, slight, and well proportioned, and, when his fresh colour faded, somewhat fragile looking. His shabby clothes had a pathetic sug gestiveness, especially from the point of view of"], [19, "A PARSON AT BAY. 11 Lord Bavant, who knew all about the parson's affairs. \" He has to front the world on an income just fit for the whipper-in of a second-rate pack,\" this critic was reflecting, \" and yet goes in for marrying a woman with society tastes. I suppose the British parson gets reckless from sheer despair ! Certainly it is given to him to outfool the folly of any other son of Adam.\" Had Lord Bavant wished to remonstrate with this sublimely reckless parson, however, he should have done so at once ; for while he hesitated a small figure came flying up the garden path, and he found himself confronted by a new adversary. Up to this moment Charmian had crouched on the back seat of the cart half-numbed with fright, but when she saw the giant peer standing over her father with something like a schoolmaster's frown, she dropped to the ground, and in a trice was holding daddy's hand. Thereupon a small defiant face shook itself free of clinging curls, while eyes and voice spoke together. \" You san't touch my dear pwecious old daddy \u2014 no!\" The big gentleman gazed at her rather solemnly, and uttered a sigh. For the moment, the wealthy peer, who was childless though long married, caught himself envying the shabby parson. He spoke to the child instead of to the true delinquent. \" Don't be alarmed, little woman ; your precious daddy is a born combatant \u2014 but his coat's on again,"], [20, "A PARSON AT BAY. 12 you see ! Where did you get the gold curls and the great grey eyes, eh ? \u2014 and what's your name, my dear ? \" But Charmian, whose manners were generally so much admired, would hold no further parley with the enemy, and the defiant eyes were growing suspiciously moist. \" Well, I happen to know your name ; it's Charmian \u2014 and a very charming little Charmian you are, though you don't think me worth speaking to. You carry a special pleader about with you, vicar r The vicar, however, was too dejected even to smile, so they shook hands and parted. Lord Bavant and his brother drove rapidly away ; Mr. Brockenheart walked droopingly back to his wife. The cob shook himself gradually into a trot, and very soon the old glove was on again, and the driving hand thrust forward in the fashion that Maisie always found so irritating. She looked straight to her front for the present, without com menting upon the incident. The cherry mouth was a little compressed \u2014 that was all. But that was enough. The sanguine parson was the most crushable of men. He winced under his wife's unspoken displeasure, and was now convinced that his conduct had been thoroughly blameworthy. \" I'm sorry for having vexed and frightened you, dear,\" he said presently ; \" but I always was hasty and impulsive.\" \"Yes?\""], [21, "A PARSON AT BAY. 13 Claud felt the impact of the monosyllable, as of a stone cast at him. As a warm-blooded man, he was tempted to fly out a little and defend himself ; but as a soft-hearted one, from whom rebukes came with difficulty, he held his tongue. Nor could he turn to his usual consoler ; Charmian was too young to understand the punishment that he was now under going, and so relieved at his double escape from the keeper and the peer as to be quite easy in her mind about him. After a further silence of some minutes, Mrs. Brockenhart pronounced sentence thus, speaking quietly, but firmly : \u2014 \"You know, Claud, that we're poor enough, and likely to remain so, unless Aunt Mabel comes for ward. Your only chance of promotion is to keep well with the county magnates, yet yon are con stantly making an enemy of one or other of them, and so thwarting all my efforts for your advance ment. Miss Crackanthorpe was complaining of your week-day services only yesterday.\" \" Complaining \u2014 why ? She never comes to them.\" \" She objects to them on principle, it seems. Her views differ from yours ; and she says the Sabbath is the proper day for worship.\" \" Do you suppose,\" cried the parson, \" that I'm going to forego my plain duty to suit the whims of that narrow-minded old woman ? \" \" Oh dear no \u2014 I know you too well for that, Claud ! \""], [22, "14 A PARSON AT BAY. Maisie said this with a sigh, but with a glint of humour in her eyes which lightened the heart of the soon-repentant parson. \" I believe I am rather trying at times, dear,\" he murmured, rubbing his chin with one of the obnoxious gloves, \" yet you're never out of temper for more than three minutes together.\" In point of fact the bride had hardly been out of temper at all \u2014 at least, since Captain Aubrey's appearance on the scene. To a woman with a marked taste for being worshipped, Aubrey's half amazed but respectful admiration would have been a sufficient makeweight to worse trials than the small fright she had sustained. Yet it would not have been politic to let Claud off too easily, for even a manageable husband must not be driven upon too slack a rein. The solution of the little problem before mentioned, too, depended upon his docility this afternoon. As he was now growing tractable. she decided to feel his mouth a little before tight ening the rein further. \" I think, Claud, you can hardly go to the Castle in that pair of gloves, can you ? \" \" Well, I hate spending money, dear, but you are right. I'll get a new pair as we pass through the High Street,\" \" I suppose you must call at the bank also ? \" \" Yes,\" he sighed. \" I'm afraid so. There are one or two things to talk over with the manager.\" Soon after this they reached the outskirts of South Bavant, and pulled up in front of the County"], [23, "A PARSON AT BAY. 15 Bank \u2014 that is to say, Mr. Brockenhart drew in his reins one half-hearted inch or so, rather hoping that the cob, with the stable smell now almost in his nostrils, would demur at the stoppage. But the perverse brute, having no sympathy in his com position, halted at once, and stood there as compla cently as though, instead of being a picture of ugliness, he were a living epitome of all the points that a horse should possess. The bank had a sleek, prosperous air that was apt to oppress Mr. Brockenhart. It was a private mansion converted into a place of business, and looked the more imposing for being separated from the street by a well-shrubbed garden. The parson passed somewhat droopingly through the open gates and up the short drive to the front door. \"Daddy doesn't seem very well \u2014 do you think he's goin' to the dentis'-man ? \" said Charmian to her stepmother. \" You should ask him to take you on the river, dear ; you would both enjoy that so much more than the stupid party at the Castle. And you could hear the band quite well from the water.\" After a lengthy pause Mr. Brockenhart returned with a quicker step ; but the observant wife noticed that his hand was unsteady, his eyes dull and fixed. Even in his figure and walk there lurked the consciousness of an account overdrawn. As he looked up and down the street before climbing into the trap again, he was thinking, as she guessed"], [24, "A PARSON AT BAY. 16 rightly, of certain bills, long and prickly as brambles, running up against him on both sides of the way. Nearly opposite them stood Mr. Boosey, the thriving butcher, in the mouth of his shop, with his eye wandering from joints and carcases to meet the eye of Parson Brockenhart, who was deeper in his books than a poor parson had any right to be. The Yicar of Marsh-under-Cliff, he understood, had a difficulty in getting his tithes paid : but that was neither here nor there ; if a clergyman was too nice to pinch his farmers, he would have to be tweaked himself one of these fine days, and that was all about it. \" Now for the Castle,\" said Mrs. Brockenhart, cheerfully, as they moved forward again ; \" we shall meet half the county there, no doubt.\" \" Ah ! \" sighed the parson, as though daunted by the prospect. \" I'm sure Lady Bavant would take charge of me, dear, if you really don't care to come. See, that is her carriage stopping at the post-office.\" \"I don't like to desert you,\" he murmured, waveringly. Then she turned to him with a ravishing smile which was reserved for special occasions, and begged him not to trouble about her. He was a dear good fellow, but might be quite easy in his mind ; she could quite well go under the wing of Lady Bavant, who was always so kind to her. And, as for Char mian, she would probably enjoy an afternoon on the river far more than the party ; for the children,"], [25, "A PARSON AT BAY. 17 who were to be entertained separately in one of the Castle fields, would be playing games in which the little thing would be too young to join. Any one \u2014 at least, any member of the sterner sex \u2014 who had seen the dainty little bride thus en treating her husband in his own interest, with the full blaze of her winsome eyes making havoc of him, would have pardoned Claud Brockenhart that hasty and reckless second marriage of his. Much stronger men, even with purses as dangerously shallow, might have succumbed to such an adversary. \"You'd be disappointed at missing the party, little girl ? \" whispered the parson over his shoulder. Certainly Charmian would be disappointed ; she thought yearningly of all the pretty dresses in the Castle grounds, the band, the tennis, and all the other delights. On the other hand, her father's evident wish was dragging at her ; and without him the parts would be like chocolates with no cream in them ; and they might find a thrush's nest full of blue eggs up the river, and \u2014 and at length she gulped out \u2014 \" I'll come with you, daddy.\" \" The boat will cost two shillings for three hours. I ought not to spend the money ? \" he muttered, doubtingly. \" But the gloves would cost half a crown, so you'll save sixpence,\" Maisie added, in a smooth stroking little murmur. \" That's well thought of ! \" he cried, with his 2"], [26, "18 A PARSON AT BAY. sanguine smile returning. \" Why, that will leave us sixpence for buns and sweets, Charmie, and we'll have a little picnic all to ourselves ! \" So a way out of the difficulty was found \u2014 and therewith a complete solution of Maisie's little problem."], [27, "A PARSON AT BAY. 19 CHAPTER II. \" How now ! Even so quickly may one catch the plague ? \" Shakspeke. MOUTH BAVANT CASTLE was an amalgam sSa of old feudal ruin and nineteenth-century country house, situated upon a little eminence which overhung the left bank of the river. The old Norman keep was still imposing, and the modern battlemented building attached thereto was as nearly in agreement with it as human skill could compass. The original outer wall of the enceinte, also, was intact on two sides, and a projecting round tower still flanked the long curtain which rose steeply behind the riverside willows. What had been the outer bailey, between this wall and the central buildings, was now an emerald basin of turf shaded by a few scattered trees. But, with the above exceptions, there was left no stone of the old place. The once-grim Castle had lost its frown, replacing it by a smile which showed hardly a trace of sorrow for its stately past. Bright flower-beds ran up to the very parapet wall ; great laburnums, now that the spring was far advanced, hung their"], [28, "20 A PARSON AT BAY. golden racemes against the warm stonework of the keep ; and the river below curved placidly through lustrous meadows which had once been, as an old chronicler has it, \" a right blacke, deep, and noyous marshe.\" As for the Castle's history, the sieges it had borne, the kings it had entertained, and such musty matters, no one could know less about them than did the honest town-folk who lived under its shadow. Their chief concern was the question of its occupa tion : when the Castle was empty both Trade and Society grumbled ; and when, as latterly, the place had been in the hands of caretakers for two full years, the grumbling was loud and continuous. However, soon after the announcement of Mr. Brockenhart's engagement, which caused a little stir by reason of its deep fatuity, that small event was swallowed up in gossip-matter of wider import \u2014 it became known that a young, and presumably wealthy, foreigner was making inquiries about the Castle. The rumour quickly passed from the loose straggling stage into the closer form which can be handed about from drawing-room to smoking-room without a perpetual gathering up of loose threads. It was stated with confidence, that the foreigner was a French- American ; that he had actually taken the Castle for a term of years ; that he was coming over to assume possession about Christmas time. His father was vaguely described as a \" distinguished American,\" his mother was a Frenchwoman of ancient family, his paternal grandmother was sprung"], [29, "A PARSON AT BAY. 21 from an ancient English stock, once well known in this county. His name was Hereward Paul Otis. All ;this was good; and better followed it. It was proved beyond doubt that Mr. Hereward Otis did in truth possess the crowning virtue of great wealth. The neighbourhood thereupon drew a deep breath of satisfaction, which was afterwards found to be quite justifiable. In fact, Mr. Otis had from the first taken care that everything worth knowing about him should be known accurately. He had no wish to pose as a mysterious personage, nor yet to undergo the cross-examination, however deftly conducted, of an English country-side. So he, metaphorically speaking, hung up his pedigree on the Castle gates, and nailed a full statement of his fortune beside it. Further, he came over soon after Christmas, and quietly established himself as a potential English country gentleman ; entering his name on all subscription lists where it was due, and meekly accepting all and sundry invitations. At the end of the hunting season he retired again to Paris ; but the yearning neighbourhood learned that he would be back some time in the spring to take up his final abode at the Castle, with his only sister to keep house for him. Consider for a moment the possibilities of the situation. Here was a young man, a rich man, a bachelor ; a man with old French blood in his veins, stiffened by old English, and frothed up, so to say, by a current of modern American ; a man"], [30, "A PARSON AT BAY. 22 who had but lately demonstrated the possibility of uniting foreign grace and courtesy with robust English sportsmanship, \u2014 in a word, a brilliant and handsome young prince, \u2014 about to settle down, unprotected, encumbered only by a maiden sister, in the very heart of a country thick-sown with marriageable young women. And think what might have been : Bavant Castle might have been taken by some gouty old city knight, with a family of vulgar daughters, or some Bond Street hatter in the full swing of a roaring trade. Truly there are moments when even grumbling humanity is satisfied, and human hearts grow too full for utterance. The \" At Home \" to which Maisie Brockenhart was to-day being driven in state by Lady Bavant was the first entertainment of note given at the Castle. The brother and sister had only lately got their house in order, but Hereward Otis, having already large arrears of hospitality to make up, was anxious to open the campaign. Lady Bavant was a bright, genial old lady ; grey haired, and scarcely so young as the earl in point of mere years, yet in some respects perhaps even younger than the little bride to whom she had taken such a fancy. She had a child's passion for amusement, and, withal, the mingled shallowness and good nature which combine so effectually for the smoothing of life's creases. Maisie Brockenhart was the countess's last new plaything, and was careful to preserve the freshness which makes a toy acceptable. She was shrewd enough only to be"], [31, "A PARSON AT BAY. 23 clever in the right place, to be ready with small jokes, and give no hint of the finer humour that was within her gift. Not that Lady Bavant ever exacted cheerfulness from her friends or dependants, for her own was proof against all possible assaults. She would purr as kindly and cheerfully over the deathbed of an old pensioner as over the troth plighting of some pretty village protegee. And, if she never suffered any pang deeper than that of gently genial pity, she certainly never grudged that small outlay of emotion. The countess was handsome, too, as well as pleasantly genial, with well-cut aquiline features, and a smile which men liked to look upon ; in fact, the great lady and her young charge made a very striking picture together, as the latter was perfectly aware. As they whirled down the High Street, many satisfied glances were turned upon the stately smiling countess and the flower-faced girl with the brilliant eyes. And no wonder the eyes shone more brightly than usual. Little Maisie had a fairly strong head, but the atmosphere she was now breathing was sufficiently intoxicating. The change in her sur roundings had been theatrical in its suddenness : a moment ago the poor trap and shapeless cob ; now the fairy-godmother equipage, with resplendent footmen and dashing high-mettled greys. And further, she was about to enter what was likely to be the greatest country gathering of the year, to which people were coming from prodigious"], [32, "24 A PARSON AT BAY. distances, under the wing of the greatest lady in the neighbourhood. Thus the mere crust of the situa tion was attractive enough ; and beneath this were possibilities\u2014 a vista of glowing possibilities \u2014 of which only herself and one other person could have the least conception. Maisie presently entered the Castle drawing-room in Lady Bavant 's wake, with a sense that she was walking straight into a printed page. Her name would inevitably appear in society journals next week ; the world would learn that Mrs. Brockenhart, one of the Countess of Bavant 's party, was \" gowned in a charming little confection of black, white, and primrose.\" Yes, every item of her toilette would be chronicled; and long residence in Paris, furthered by her own talents and a cheque from Aunt Mabel, had enabled her to achieve something worth recording. The room was long, and rather low, and was brimming with the puffed sleeves, wide hats, and lacy trillings of the largest social gathering she had ever beheld. For a second or two the density of the throng, and still more its quietness, be wildered her. Being accustomed to lively, chatter ing Parisian crowds, she found something impressive in the very inertness of this solemn function. A few moments, however, served to disperse the first chilling sense of disappointment. The first glance, perhaps, suggested the absurdity of her late expectations. She had hoped, forsooth, to make a little sensation this afternoon, and now was ready to"], [33, "A PARSON AT BAY. 25 blush with shame at her own conceit. But a second glance steadied her, while a third went far towards restoring her complacence. True, most of the women were fashionable and well dressed ; but how many were successfully dressed? Her eyes swept half the assembly's headgear without finding any thing that struck the right note, filled up the chord of a toilette, as it were, as did her own trans parent black hat. The only person in the room worthy of a moment's envy was the hostess herself. Miss Otis was a new comer, and in a rather trying position for a girl of eighteen, but bore herself, Maisie thought, to perfection. She was tall, slight, and olive skinned \u2014 French-looking, most people said, rather than American. She spoke as graciously to little Mrs. Brockenhart as to great Lady Bavant. Both were charmed with her, as every one else had been. This suave young hostess, moreover, did not disguise her admiration of the bride, whom she now saw for the first time. She whispered a few words to Lady Bavant which Maisie felt to be something complimentary about herself. \" Yes, yes,\" purred the elder lady, delighted with her protegee's success, \" and she's a charming little thing too \u2014 lately married to our vicar, you know. I only hope,\" she added, breaking into the genial little chuckle without which she seldom ended a sentence, \"that she won't turn all the men's heads.\""], [34, "26 A PARSON AT BAY. On falling back to make room for the next group of arrivals, Maisie felt a little shy and solitary ; but that was her last moment of self-doubt. Captain Aubrey, who had been following her about with his eyes from a corner of the room, now made his way to her, and carried her off through the French windows on to the lawn. Now it befell that this emergence from the drawing-room was the beginning of a new era for Maisie Brockenhart. She had been petted and admired ever since she could remember, but never upon so large a stage as this. It is one thing to be the heroine of a drawing-room play ; another, to find the eyes of a great theatre, packed with people, focussed upon you. It was Maisie's fate this afternoon to drink for the first time a draught of choicest triumph \u2014 and there after she would never again be quite the same person. Old ideals were enlarged and glorified almost at a touch ; old ambitions widened and deepened ; old hopes so swollen as hardly to be recognizable. For once, chance seemed to have brought together all the conditions necessary to social success. She was new to the neighbourhood, yet not unknown ; there was a halo of romance about her as a beautiful young girl who had fore gone all her chances to marry a poor parson for love. Her beauty, too, was of the rich sumptuous order which burns most brightly in a great environ ment. She was well bred, and perfectly self possessed ; unconscious, to all appearance, of the"], [35, "A PARSON AT BAY. 27 sensation she was creating ; gifted with the power of accepting homage without making too much of it. The men crowded round her, so that she was glad to link herself on to Lady Bavant again as soon as possible. This made no difference, however. They strolled to and fro with a group of gentlemen always sur rounding them, and every halt they made seemed but to thicken the throng. Meanwhile, the emerald basin became more and more crowded with people, and the air was filled with wild Hungarian music, reverberating from the old keep, near which stood the band, shadowed by a great laburnum. Maisie was by this time a little pale with excite ment, but her spirit rose with every fresh demand upon it. It happened that she could talk rather better than most people, yet she was too true an artist to spoil her part this afternoon by a single clever remark ; she seemed to know just when to use another of her gifts \u2014 the art of listening well. Lady Bavant marvelled at her quiet tactful accept ance of so much adulation. One thing surprised Maisie \u2014 that Mr. Otis never once came near her. It might seem a small omission on the part of a host burdened with a castleful of guests ; but she had special reasons for being sur prised \u2014 perhaps for being deeply gratified. Here ward Otis was a former friend, of whom she had seen a good deal in the days when she was a student in a Paris atelier, though she had not yet mentioned the fact on this side of the Channel. It occurred to her"], [36, "28 A PARSON AT BAY. now, her brief triumph having taught her to con ceive flattering possibilities which she would have laughed at an hour ago, that perhaps he could not bring himself to greet her in face of a crowd of people. Nor was her victorious progress quite completed, though its culminating moment was to come shortly, when the general move towards the bowling-green took place. That ancient piece of turf ran parallel to the river, on a level raised well above the reach of floods. It was shaded by fine elms, and surrounded by a raised moss-grown pathway. One or two kings of England were said to have taken their pastime in this quiet spot ; and one or two rather great per sonages were about to follow their illustrious example this afternoon ; a modern fashionable crowd taking the place of the retinue of knights and gentlemen who had doubtless applauded the royal skill with old-world warmth, haply carrying on their little private bickerings the while with quite modern acerbity. As Maisie Brockenhart was asked to play for one side, Captain Aubrey managed to be of the same party, as well as to establish himself as her instructor and critic. She made a genuine effort to extricate herself from a position so provocative of envy and hatred, but Aubrey had found his innings with her all too short. A crowd of men of more social skill and capacity for seizing chances, had kept him at a distance for the last hour, and now his turn was"], [37, "A PARSON AT BAY. 29 come. During the preliminary practice he explained to her the use of the bias, and demonstrated the ease with which a beginner may play bowls without conspicuous failure. Happily the rest of the party knew as little of the game as herself, so that she found herself ranged with a duke, a cabinet minister, and some other distinguished persons without feeling quite overwhelmed. In fact, she found a spice of bracing comedy in the situation. To begin the afternoon a humble parson's wife in a rustic vicarage, and to finish it in this gorgeously conspicuous fashion, with some two hundred people watching her per formance in a game which she had never before attempted, tickled her sense of humour, and so stirred her courage afresh. Meanwhile, under the overhanging willows of the river bank, though Maisie was not aware of it, was a boat containing her husband and his little daughter. They had been drifting about under the wall, listen ing to the Hungarian music, for Charmian was loth to leave the Enchanted Castle. From thence they could see the bonnets and parasols of the spectators on their own side of the bowling-green, and could hear the occasional click of two lignum vit\u00e6 balls in collision. The child's heart was sore and throbbing with disappointment ; at this moment she would have given all the flowers and bird's nests in the land for one good look at the pretty ladies, whose mere parasols fluttered her so. Her father, too, had a sense of being shunted aside by society, thrust out"], [38, "30 A PARSON AT BAY. into the cold by his poverty. He might have moralized upon the coincidence of a grown man's sore feeling with that of a disappointed child's, deducing from it the wonderful solidarity of human nature ; but concrete feeling is apt to spoil excur sions into abstract philosophy, and he presently dipped his sculls as impatiently as though he had never opened a book on psychology, or given a thought to it. Nor did he regain his serenity until he had covered a couple of miles of water, and Charmian, having leaped gleefully ashore, was wading among the grass and flowers which over hung her favourite reach of the upper river."], [39, "A PARSON AT BAY. 31 CHAPTER III. \" It is in men as in soils, where sometimes there is a vein of gold the owner knows not of.\" \u2014 Swift. U\u00a36j8| AISIE was rather glad when the game of bowls ta&M was over. Thanks to Captain Aubrey's hints and encouragements, she got through it without discredit, in spite of the throng of critics ; but the ordeal by gaze was severe, and her nerve barely held out until the finish of the game. When that came, she felt that she had partaken of as much triumph as could be assimilated in one afternoon ; her head ached distractingly, and she was glad to stroll away from the crowd with Lady Bavant and Captain Aubrey. She had an odd sense of repose in Captain Aubrey's company, as though he were an old friend, instead of the acquaintance of an afternoon. Unlike any of the other members of her train, he made no attempt at agreeable conversation, but walked at her side in a stony sardonic fashion, as though scorning all pretence of being socially attractive. She understood that he was a \" plunger \" \u2014 a very fast plunger, people said, and a constant anxiety to his brother the earl, who had paid his debts more than"], [40, "A PARSON AT BAY. 32 once. Yet his curt abrupt manner pleased her, while his dumb admiration was, perhaps, more subtly flattering than all the conventional homage to which she had listened to-day. Nor did he look as wicked, at least to her inexperienced eyes, as he was painted. He was a fairish man, deeply tanned, heavy-moustached, large-framed \u2014 though shorter than his giant brother. As for Aubrey himself, he could not yet analyze the effect produced upon him by this winsome girl bride. There was a dim perception that she subdued him as much by her goodness as her beauty. She had none of the fast ways of the women whose society he chiefly affected. Not one of them had ever impressed him as she did. The halo of self sacrifice and innocence that clung to this young girl who had wedded a penniless parson, seemed to purify his thinking ; he felt the better for being in her presence. A looker-on would hardly have expected this dalliance with another's belongings to be morally stimulating to the man ; but, in truth, it was proving so. \" I couldn't do a mean thing by this girl,\" Aubrey was thinking to himself. \" I couldn't deceive her even about a small thing. Suppose I had met one like her ten years ago, before I began to go down hill ? \" Maisie seemed to depress, as well as to subdue him. A little sentence, not yet given to any printer, but, of late, familiar to his mind's eye, as though studied in actual type, acquired a new"], [41, "A PARSON AT BAY. 33 pathos as he muttered it to himself now : \" Captain the Hon. Ulick Charles Aubrey resigns his com mission.\" \" Resigns, too,\" some people might add, \" his social position, and goes to the dogs forthwith.\" As for the little bride herself, though possessed of fair average vanity, she was hardly yet aware how powerful a weapon for good or ill she carried in her beauty, how deadly a solvent of man's judgment may be a pair of blue eyes and a cherry mouth. She was at present somewhat in the position of a small boy carrying a loaded pistol, ready to draw trigger upon anything furred or feathered, but hardly realizing that his prowess may compass the actual death of any living creature. When they returned to the bowling-green, the group of children, decked, for the occasion, in sixteenth-century costume, had just completed their game, and the crowd was beginning to disperse. But that youthful hedonist, Lady Bavant, had not yet taken her fill of pleasure. Mr. Otis had promised to show her his studio, and she had no intention of leaving until she had explored it thoroughly \u2014 especially as the promise had been wrung from the artist with difficulty. Now, most of his new friends would have been surprised to hear that Hereward Otis was a painter at all. Yet, in truth, he was before all things an artist, though, having an impression that the English were all Philistines at the core, and being withal a man of intense pride and quick nervous 3"], [42, "34 A PARSON AT BAY. susceptibility, he would not put forward his painting stuff to earn for himself the mockery of his country neighbours. He preferred to be written down Nimrod and Society-man, and, probably without being quite aware of the fact, had to this end made his debut in the hunting season. Once established as a commonplace country gentleman, he might after wards be free to live his private life unmolested. It will be seen that his conception of the English had been formed among their hereditary enemies in Paris. Otis's devotion to art, as well as his remarkable talent, had been the talk of many ateliers during Maisie's student period. Hand-to-mouth strugglers, to whom a meat dinner came as a special con descension of the gods, had been amazed to see a man of his known wealth grinding, resolutely as any poor devil of them all, through the tiresome mechanical routine that must precede any real achievement with the brush. The new lessee of Bavant Castle was, in brief, a born artist, as well as a highly trained one, and he disliked nothing more than the exposure of his work to the ecstatic little commonplaces of ordinary people. Lady Bavant, he felt sure, would purr over his pictures like a pleased child, and crush his finest conception with a \" Sweetly pretty ! \" or a \" How charming ! \" But this afternoon the countess chanced to have with her a companion of quite another genre, some one in whom he took a deeper interest than he was yet quite willing to admit to himself."], [43, "A PARSON AT BAY. 35 It is true that, although he had been at the same studio as Maisie during her brief painting career, and so had been constantly thrown with her, he had never openly joined the over-full ranks of her admirers ; yet he had been greatly attracted by her, and the more so, perhaps, because a certain proud reserve, and fastidious dread of proving himself to be as great a fool as his fellows, had brought his will into play. He had fought hard against the weakness, firmly resolving to be no love-sick driveller, but to live a free man and develop all the art-stuff that was in him. Despite his love of freedom, however, and deep aversion to all the cruder emotions, he had ended by falling a victim to what he considered the most earthy and con temptible of all passions \u2014 jealousy. A most ordinary, simple-hearted, sanguine English parson on a holiday trip to Paris \u2014 a man with a vile French accent and a most puerile conception of art\u2014 became deeply enamoured of Maisie. She was hardly likely to do other than laugh at the simple fellow ;\u2022 still he was an excrescence \u2014 one of those tiresome, happy, fresh-coloured men whom nothing rebuffs. And after some weeks there were rumours that the gem of the studio showed dangerous symptoms ; it seemed that she might in the end come to throw herself away upon the interloper. Had Otis known her circumstances more in timately, such a possibility might have seemed less outrageous. Maisie was the only child of a widower, a retired English colonel of good family, but"], [44, "A PARSON AT BAY. 36 dissipated habits. It was her first object in life to be independent of a parent who cared little for her and grudged every penny spent upon her education ; and she had pluckily resolved to achieve this end by professional painting. But a brief experience sufficed to expose the fatuity of this hope. Her talent, though above the average, was critical, rather than creative ; it must needs be years and years before she could hope to win independence through brush and palette. Moreover, she liked this Claud Brocken hart, and respected his sterling worth ; and having been so long knocked about from pillar to post by a selfish complaining father, the position of a country parson's wife, with county society and a devoted husband, was not without charm. While as for the parent himself, he perhaps agreed with Sancho Panza's wife, that \" better is a daughter but humbly married than highly kept.\" So it came about that Otis awoke one morning to the discovery that the fresh-coloured intruder had won for himself a peerless bride. The artist's pangs were acute enough to scorch his pride severely. He began to loathe an atmo sphere which had fostered in him so contemptible a weakness. His resentment against Paris being deep as vanity itself, he began to reconsider a plan that he had once formed of taking a country place on the other side of the Channel, where the experiment of interspersing art production with English country pursuits might be attempted. Pricked and fretted as he now was, any scheme involving change smelt"], [45, "A PARSON AT BAY. 37 freshly to him. The very next month found him viewing an assortment of English country-houses and granges. Bavant Castle, however, attracted him from the first ; while, as for the proximity of Mr. Brocken hart's country parish, he put that out of his mind altogether. Indeed, to reassure himself on this point, he was at pains to inspect a dozen other places ; yet Bavant Castle, purely on its own merits, distanced all competitors, and the anxious neigh bourhood won him, as we have seen. A studio had been built for this hyper-sensitive artist at a spot well removed from house and gardens. It stood in an open glade on the far side of the rookery, and was led up to by a winding narrow path, thickly bushed. The air of the glade on bright mornings was full of drowsy musical cawings ; its outlook embraced suave curvings of the river amid breadths of peaceful meadow, where, all through the summer, lazy kine would be reclining in the shadow-blots of a hundred pollard willows. Otis was a fastidious man, inclined to judge all things English somewhat hardly, but he secretly considered this nook of his to be as nearly perfect as can be upon a planet so innately crude and commonplace as ours. He was devoutly thankful that no one but Lady Bavant had on this occasion thought of his studio sanctum ; but, as she had outstayed his other guests expressly to see it, his promise must be fulfilled. And so the fall of evening found a small party"], [46, "A PARSON AT BAY. 38 of pilgrims wending its way to the secluded shrine. The party consisted of Lady Bavant and Maisie, Captain Aubrey, and their host and hostess. Miss Otis, in high spirits at the success of the party, looked radiant and handsome. She would have liked to dance and sing along the bushy path with some girl of her own age, instead of walking decorously beside the countess. Yet her present companion proved far from suppressive ; to Lady Bavant every one with a pretty face to catch the eye, and a tongue to tickle the ear pleasantly, was charming \u2014 and Dorothy Otis had both, and the sparkle and verve of a French-American to boot. Before they were halfway to the studio the elder lady's genial chuckles had begun to follow each other in quick succession. Behind them followed Mr. Otis and Mrs. Brocken hart, talking with a solemn propriety which seemed to rebuke the frivolous young people in front ; last of all stalked Captain Aubrey, wrapped in sulky silence. It appeared from the conversation of the couple in front of him that they were not quite strangers ; they appeared to have met once or twice in Paris, and he somehow resented this previous acquaintanceship. Otis talked about art and literature \u2014 subjects not understanded of his present critic \u2014 and talked well ; he was evidently a clever and cultured man, that is, in plain Aubrey-English, a prig. Some people might call him handsome, but Aubrey thought him"], [47, "A PARSON AT BAY. 39 effeminate-looking ; a slight dark fellow with a small head and a little silky moustache; \"a finicky drawing-room man,\" as Aubrey muttered viciously to himself, \" with the manners of a d \u2014 d French man.\" He secreted a fresh supply of dislike for this Frenchman at every stride, and was getting on towards hatred by the time they reached the studio. Lady Bavant had a simple-hearted, not unjustifi able pride in her French, and inside the studio the conversation was carried on in that language. Otis welcomed with satisfaction a vehicle of expression which takes half the sting from a commonplace ; but the change completed the disgust of his English critic, to whom not a word of their rapid chatter was comprehensible. After the first few minutes Aubrey took station in the doorway, staring moodily at the land scape, with an occasional jealous glance at the talkers. Maisie was now in a more highly strung condition than she had been during the whole feverish after noon. Nothing could be more piquant and stimu lating than the discovery that Otis's half resentful admiration of her had suffered no abatement. She felt that he was as keenly wrought-up and excited as herself; so much so, indeed, that he could with difficulty do the honours of the place, and attend to the countess's comments and compliments. Yet the kindly old lady insisted upon seeing everything, and moreover displayed a genuine taste for delicate"], [48, "40 A PARSON AT BAY. work, without pretending to much command of art jargon. At any other time Maisie would have revelled in the artist's graceful fancies and subtle colour harmonies, but to-day could hardly see the canvases upon which she gazed ; deep personal gratification so clouded her perceptive faculties that for the moment she was no better than a blind Philistine. One picture, however \u2014 or, rather, study\u2014 she did see thoroughly, if briefly. This was a small unframed canvas which Otis drew out from a corner, holding it up to her for a second or two while his sister was expounding to Lady Bavant a fairy subject from the \" Midsummer Night's Dream.\" \" This,\" Otis remarked, in the quiet explanatory tone of a cicerone, and still speaking in French, \" is about the best study of a head that I ever made. Unfortunately my sitter disappointed me, and so it was never finished. I still retain something in the nature of a grudge against her. She was of quite exceptional beauty, as you may perceive, thou\u00b0-h the modelling of the cheek is defective, and the splendid fire of the eyes is not given at all.\" He replaced the canvas immediately behind a heap of others, while for a moment the whole room swayed before Maisie. The man's quiet audacity had half stunned her ; the picture being a study of her own head, made in Paris just before Claud Brockenhart's appearance on the scene. Captain Aubrey, from his post at the door,"], [49, "A PARSON AT BAY. 41 observed the incident uncomprehendingly, yet with a dim sense of its containing something that needed comprehension. Soon afterwards they all emerged into the glade again. Instinctively all eyes were turned westward, over the meads washed with amber light to the low suave lines of hill upon which the sunset rested lingeringly. All the windings of the river were touched with gold, the trees seemed to droop and tremble in the richness, and the very quietude of the scene had a heart of sadness. As Maisie gazed under her shading hand a waft of pathos and self-pity stole over her. Had she but known how to wait, had she but given time for \u00e6sthetic admiration to pass into personal love, she might have become the mistress of some such place as this, always encompassed by beautiful things, with all sordid cares put away and forgotten. And, unconsciously, she was leading the two men with her. Otis, like herself, was thinking of what might have been ; reflecting with bitter self-upbraiding of his fatuous throwing away of this pearl of price \u2014 \"richer than all his tribe.\" Aubrey, under the influence of the first beautiful woman who had ever touched him purely, was yearning back to the time when he too cared for fields and sunsets, \u2014 when he had come home to The Towers, a grown man of seventeen who had said good-bye to Eton, and revelled in the autumn beauties of park and covert. That was a whole lifetime ago. Dorothy Otis gazed with the others, uttering the"], [50, "42 A PARSON AT BAY. gentle sigh of a young girl to whom the noblest moments of nature are as nothing to the glories of life that are coming. Lady Bavant, alone of the party, was quite unmoved. She was thinking how well this charming heiress would suit poor Ulick, whose wild oats must surely be nearly sown, and reflecting upon the constitution of her next dinner party, to be given in honour of the Otises. After a moment or two a boat appeared round the near bend of the river, and Lady Bavant exclaimed \u2014 \" Look, Maisie ; isn't that Mr. Brockenhart, with little Charmian facing him ? \" \" I think it is,\" said Maisie, \" and I shall be just in time to meet them at the bridge landing-stage.\" Aubrey threw a covert glance at Otis's face, which sufficed to bring vague suspicions to a head. A sullen jealous light had come into his eyes before caution could repress it, making a little epoch for both men, as well as for Maisie, who looked from one to the other just before lowering her lashes. Maisie herself had no thought of any real danger. She conceived of her position just now as that of a romantic bride, to be worshipped at a distance by all men \u2014 a sovereign whom they would admire the more deeply as being the occupant of an unap proachable throne. And precisely in this light Ulick Aubrey \u2014 the man who from an a priori point of view might have been looked upon as a far more dangerous personage than the artist \u2014 was regarding her. The finger of Chance had touched upon the vein of gold that he"], [51, "A PARSON AT BAY. 43 possessed unawares; his nature, warped and em bittered by manifold harassments, was kindling as though a shaft from the sunset had pierced it ; he was silently, and probably unconsciously, arraying himself as her guardian and champion."], [52, "A PARSON AT BAY. 44 CHAPTER IV. Dead for a ducat, dead.\" \u2014 Shakspere. 111! HE parish of Marsh-under-Cliff was a wide- reaching one, and, for reasons deep as the soil, of an oddly mixed social and moral character. The parsonage, for instance, stood upon the windy back of a long sandstone escarpment that broke abruptly into cliffs on the seaward side, but sloped gently northward down to the flat marsh-lands of the river valley. For miles along this ridge no other dwelling-house fronted the channel breezes ; it was a chain of lonely sandhills, furze-brakes, and rabbit-warrens. On the right, or southern bank of the river clustered the large village which gave its name to the parish. It was inhabited by a thriving colony of fishermen \u2014 -or, to be more precise, netsmen. For, in truth, these honest fellows could handle gate-nets for hares, purse-nets for rabbit- burrows, and the like, at least as well as the trawls, seines, etc., of their ostensible trade. They knew how to train ferrets and lurcher dogs ; how to strip a trout-stream with chloride of lime, how to burn sulphur under pheasants \u2014 in a word, how to make"], [53, "A PARSON AT BAY. 45 the gamekeeper's life one of pleasing healthy activity. They were never over-modest, particular, or timid ; a spawning salmon, a covey of partridges roosting in the open, a brace of corn-fed pheasants wandering after beechmast, were each and all accept able. And the lean soil of these parts, if it hindered husbandry, encouraged wild creatures, furred, feathered, or clothed, allowing a man of spirit to live on a scale far higher than that suggested by the amount of his lawful earnings. So much for the lower portion of the parish. Northwards, however, desolation bordered upon fatness, sand and gravel giving place to rich loam, every acre of which yielded corn, hops, or roots. Thus Mr. Brockenhart was the spiritual ruler of a country-side, having its upper latitudes flowing with milk and honey, and supporting such places as The Towers, Lord Bavant's seat ; while, lower down, land and water together only sufficed to nourish the aforesaid race of hardy fisher-sportsmen. As a tribute to propriety, the Earl of Bavant must be written down the most important personage of this little kingdom ; but, having said this, it may be added that the master of the greatest number of human wills, the man who could set the greatest number of human bodies moving in any given direction at a word, was one Jethro Keylock, of the Black House \u2014 commonly called \" Old Keylock.\" Old Keylock, whose overlordship covered all the sandy latitudes, and whose sway was absolute, had"], [54, "46 A PARSON AT BAY. been in his youth a distinguished smuggler; nor had time dispersed the halo of his ancient glory. In this district smuggling had continued long after the time of its general decay ; partly by reason of special local facilities, partly through the unquenchably lawless spirit of the fisher colony, but most of all thanks to the skill, daring, and power of Old Keylock himself. Even steam and electricity, which together had ruined free trade all along the coast, had not quite beaten flat the spirit of one strong enough to keep up a public opinion of his own creation, and the hard crust of whose personality was proof against all the corrosion of time and civilization. Stubborn pride had enabled him so far to make good his boast that he would never cease to smuggle, though the once gallant trade had dwindled to a mere trickle of what he called \" little sneakin' jobs.\" The red-sailed fleet, for instance, when mackerel-fishing in mid-channel, would occa sionally tranship a small cargo of tobacco or a few tubs of brandy, to be quietly landed on return from the fishing-grounds; and now and then such an entry as the following would find its way into the books of the neighbouring coastguard station : \u2014 \" At Lobster Quay, on the 4th inst., were picked up on the beach some pieces of wood cut for the size of shocking up casks, with leaf tobacco stowed in close. The hole plugged up with bung, planed smooth, etc.\" But the old fierce coast fights were no more ;"], [55, "A PARSON AT BAY. 47 there were no sinkings of great crops of tubs, no midnight \" creepings up \" of the same, no dashes over dark heaths and through forest rides. All the spice and romance of the trade had evaporated when it ceased to pay. Old Keylock lived, as befitted a chieftain of his mark, apart from his vassals, yet in full view of all their goings and comings. His castle was a tarred wooden house built on the lonely spit of land which made the seaward barrier of the harbour. From his doorway he looked forth upon the narrow tide race through which the harbour emptied itself into the open Channel. North-westward of him stretched the river estuary, with its solemn spread of great reed-beds and curving waters ; while abreast of his front door, on the opposite shore of the narrows, stood Lobster Quay. It was, perhaps, well for the vicar that the Quay was thus cut off from the bulk of his flock by more than a mile of water, for in the village there was a fair sprinkling of law-abiding folks to leaven the general mass, while down here lived a compact group of veritable incurables. Indeed the tumble-down houses on the Quay unconsciously attested the moral condition of the black sheep who inhabited them. It was said in the neighbourhood that these houses were perfectly bare inside ; that every plank of their floors had been torn up for firewood ; that the very booms wliich marked the harbour channel were frequently broken up for the same purpose. Every turbot"], [56, "48 A PARSON AT BAY. netted, every lobster creeled by the Keylocks and Culmers \u2014 for these two names covered the entire colony \u2014 found its way to the Sheet Anchor, the gaunt inn on the Quay, to pay the shot of these choice spirits ; while, as for the fishing-boats, Old Keylock and the landlord of the Anchor probably divided the ownership between them. Mr. Brockenhart would often sigh as he walked the cliffs above his village, and watched the evening light falling redly upon these lonely roofs and the stern black home of Old Keylock, and wonder whether a better parson than himself \u2014 one with more power over his fellow-men \u2014 might perchance have reclaimed these strayed sheep down the harbour. Between the village and the tongue of sand and beach upon which Old Keylock lived stretched the river marshes, backed by the cliffy ridge upon which stood the parsonage. The ridge itself ended in a bold headland, and under the bluff the marsh land gave place to desolate sandhills. Along these sandhills, which he was pleased to look upon as his own property, Old Keylock happened to be rambling on the afternoon of the party at Bavant Castle. As usual, he bore on his shoulder the rifle which made his principal pastime when there was not breeze enough for a cruise ; and on this occasion he chanced to have as companion his nephew, Bob Keylock. The latter was, like all those of his blood, rather a peculiar fellow ; not altogether wanting in the"], [57, "A PARSON AT BAY. 49 family recklessness, yet so far broken to harness as to be a member of the vicar's household. Bob was, in fact, the vicarage factotum, who looked after a converted fishing-boat, called by courtesy the parson's \"yacht,\" and incidentally took a casual turn or two at the garden or the cob. As he had worked pretty steadily for about a week, and the home party were all at Bavant Castle this afternoon, this episodic Bob had generously offered himself a holiday, accepted the offer frankly, and decided to bestow his company upon his uncle Keydock. Indeed, things had been said about this uncle's new small-bore that made a man's trigger-finger crook in his sleep. Old Keylock had always been noted for straight shooting, but with this new weapon it was stated, hyperbolically, that he could put a bullet through the eye of an Isle of Wight Parson (as the green cormorant was locally called) at three hundred yards. Bob had dropped down the river in a duck-punt expressly to have a shot with this remarkable new toy. Their place of meeting had a beauty of its own under present conditions, with a brimming tide filling the estuary on one side of the sandhills, and crisp waves clashing musically upon their seaward foreshore. At a little distance, too, an artist in search of a human keynote to this harmony of blues and silver-browns might have been pleased with Old Keylock's figure. In the old red stocking-cap, the white beard, the long sea-boots, our artist might have acquiesced readily ; but a closer view would have 4"], [58, "50 A PARSON AT BAY. lessened satisfaction. The face and figure were too dominating, the sullen plunge of heavy boots into yielding sand was out of tune with the quiet waters and the soft curves of miniature hills. For a more strenuous mood of nature \u2014 for a wild cliff scene of gleam and gloom, the fierce old man might have served : here he crushed out the peace and beauty of the scene as he trod. And when the stern face became clearly visible, with its bitter eyes and sullen brow, an artist of any sensibility might have tossed his brushes aside to curse the jarring intruder. Old Keylock, a rough old man even in his seren est moments, was, in fact, bad to approach just now ; the rowdiest of the Quay lads, who were wont to jeer the occupants of every passing craft, gentle or simple, would have shunned him. Nephew Bob, however, was too much like his uncle to be afraid of any one ; and now drew up full in the path of the approaching figure with his cap cocked as usual, and his normal impudence no whit abashed. \"Ease your helm, old boy, and let her luff,\" he shouted ; \" I'm comin' alongside in a minute. You've no call to go rampin' down the wind like that.\" By way of reply, Old Keylock only tossed the rifle from shoulder to arm-hollow-, and grunted out something unintelligible. \"Have a drink, uncle? \" proceeded Bob, affably withdrawing his short clay. \" There's some beer in the punt, look ; an', if you han't got a thirst, I have.\""], [59, "A PARSON AT BAY. 51 Old Keylock grunted again, but altered his course. They strode down to the harbour shore together. Bob seated himself on the deck of the punt, which belonged to some one else, and, spreading his legs genially, opened a jar of beer which some one else had paid for. \" Where's the parson, then ? \" asked the old man. \"Gone to Bavant Castle with the missis, to see the grand folks.\" \" He was a d \u2014 d fool to marry that girl ! \" \"In course,\" \u2014 Bob reached out a hand for the stone jar, \u2014 \" but we're all that, when there's a pretty young thing in the case.\" \" What sort is she, d'ye think ? \" \"I don't hardly know yet. But she's got her hand on the helm a'ready ; will have her own way o'course, like all the women. If 'tis a good way, we shall do pretty well ; if not, we shall go to leeward \u2014 that's all about it.\" Uncle Keylock seated himself at the other end of the duck-punt, with his great boots half buried in ooze and seaweed ; when he next spoke there was a slight softening in the lines of his forehead. \" How's the little thing, Bob ? \" The parson, when he ventured to visit the Quay folk, generally took with him the \" little thing,\" whose presence often bettered his welcome. \" Oh, Miss Charmie's very well,\" Bob answered with a laugh. \" She wanted me to take her a-sailin'"], [60, "52 A PARSON AT BAY. this morning : said she had a baddy head, and 'twould do her good, and she'd excoose me from my gardenin'. Lord, she is a rum little thing ! \" As the old man's face threatened a smile, though without quite achieving it, Bob at once seized the propitious moment. \" Now let's have a look at the new shootin'-iron?\" he said, proffering the stone jar again with a persuasive grin. Old Keylock lifted the weapon, which lay across his knees, and the strength of his arm seemed to make a toy of it. Yet its weight astonished Bob when the rifle fell into his hands. \" Why, she's full-grown,\" he muttered. \" What d'ye want with such a deathy consarn as this, old boy?\" \" She kills a rabbit well enough, if you hold her straight,\" said the other indifferently, scraping a match along the punt's deck, and proceeding to blow a cloud. \" A rabbit ? Lord| one would think you wanted to kill a ox or a ass ! \" The old man smoked in reflective silence for a moment or two, then drew a filled cartridge from his pocket. \" This little brass thing is the food she takes,\" he explained, \" and the bullet has a hard crust o' nickel, d'ye see? She'll drive that through two foot of oak, look.\" \" Will she though ? \""], [61, "A PARSON AT BAY. 53 \" Yes \u2014 bores a hole like a big bradawl ; bores it through anything. Yet I'm not quite satisfied that she'd drop a man for certain, neither. This hard bullet don't spread when it hits a bone as the old uns did \u2014 don't mushroom, as they say ; and the question is whether a bradawl, drove through a man, would drop him as certain as a mushroom of honest lead ? \" \" But you don't want to drop a man, do 'ee ? \" cried Bob, with a laugh. Old Keylock answered nothing ; but there was compression of his heavy brows which Bob might not have liked had he been looking at the man instead of the rifle. \" What's her calibre, uncle ? \" he asked, putting the rifle to his shoulder tentatively. \" She's one o' the new-fangled small-bores \u2014 '303 of an inch, that's her calibre. I call her Miss Three-Ought-Three.\" \" She's a mighty vicious wench, too, I reckon,\" muttered Bob, \"and you oughtn't to let her go spittin' them long bullets about the harbour and marshes.\" \"Just fetch yon notice-board,\" put in the old man peremptorily ; \" he'll serve for a target, if you want to see a shot or two.\" Bob hesitated. The board had been put up lately by Lord Bavant's keepers on the neck of the promontory, where the bare sandhills gave place to some heathery knolls which closed this end of the marsh lands. It bore the usual warning to"], [62, "A PARSON AT BAY. 54 trespassers, which the Quay folks looked upon in the light of a weak joke, or a deliberate outrage, according to their mood. Lord Bavant had always allowed them to poach at will on the sandhills ; but Old Keylock kept these as his own private preserve, leaving the young fellows free of the headland, and of the marshes which engirt the estuary. This was, doubtless, a convenient arrange ment for all save Lord Bavant himself, who, finding his wild duck and snipe growing scarcer every year, and his keepers more bitter, now proposed to assert his rights more strictly. \" What, afear'd ? \" sneered the old man, seeing that Bob declined to move. \" Not afear'd o' you, anyways ! \" growled Bob, sulkily. \" Ho, ho ! has that pa'son made a blessed coward of my nevvy ? \" Bob was not afraid on his own account ; as a Keylock, mischief of any kind came natural to him ; but, having a certain patronizing partiality for the vicar, he disliked the possibility of getting his master into trouble. Stung by his uncle's contempt, however, he rose from the punt half-heartedly ; whereupon Old Key lock rose also, proceeding to revile the weakling over his shoulders as he strode towards the notice board. Reaching which, he flung it down with one drive of his heavy boot, and, not content with that, broke the upright in half by viciously stamping upon it."], [63, "A PARSON AT BAY. 55 \" There ! \" he bawled out, as though somewhat cheered by this little feat of lawdessness, \" now he'll do well enough. Take he down along for eighty or ninety yards, and set un up in the mud over agen the sandhills, and Miss Three-Ought-Three'll show 'ee what a pretty hand she writes.\" Bob obeyed \u2014 as every one did obey the fierce old fellow ; while the latter reseated himself upon the duck-punt. The board was hardly set up before it was drilled with a bullet. The crack of the rifle followed so immediately upon his withdrawal from the target that Bob gave an involuntary jerk of his whole body ; then rushed away at speed, and flung himself upon the sand with every nerve shaken and quivering. Bang \u2014 bang \u2014 bang ! Three more shots in quick succession, while the shooter sat quietly on the punt's deck, resting elbow on knee to fire. \" Now go and look at the target,\" he shouted after the last shot. Bob walked up less steadily than he could have wished, and found the four bullet holes about the middle of the board; so near together were they that he could have covered them all with a tea-cup. His knees shook from his late fright. Overhead the gulls swooped and wheeled distractedly ; all the summer quiet of the scene seemed to be jarred and shattered by the voice of the deadly weapon. \" Well ? \" said the old man, when his nephew returned with the target under his arm."], [64, "A PARSON AT BAY. 56 \" Pretty good, for an old un like you.\" Bob was not going to flatter a man who had scared him so. \" But give me a honest shot-gun. With a decent 12-bore I can kill a rabbit at twenty yards as spry as any man, if she sits still enough for me to get my aim. The owner of Miss Three-Ought-Three examined her handwriting with a matter-of-course air. He was too proud to show any hint of triumph. Not a line of his hard tanned face was allowed to express his private opinion that he was the smartest shot in England. Presently he asked, with his head still bent over the target. \"When was Nan up at your place? \u2014 early in Febr'y, wan't it ? \" \" Yes, about then ; for I remember the cob was lame at the time, and Miss Charmie was askin' of Nan every mornin', ' Is the poor gee-gee very bad ? and are they keepin' him in bed with a pou'tice on his jest ? ' But why d'ye want to know ? \" \" Was Mr. Phil at home then ? \" \" No, he weren't ; but we're expectin' of him now directly. Lord, what a pair they make, the vicar and his brother ! I'd back 'em to upset a boat, lame a 'orse, or smash a trap agen' any two yTou could name.\" \" Where did Nan go arterwards ? \" \"To Bavant Castle, or The Towers\u2014 I forget which. If you want to know you can ask Nan herself, I suppose ? \""], [65, "A PARSON AT BAY. 57 Nan was Old Keylock's only surviving child. As a rule she lived with her father in the lonely tarred house at the harbour mouth ; for, as the daughter of a chief, she was not allowed to take a servant's place, and, as a self-willed young woman who de clined to be cooped up in a shop, she had hitherto evaded her destined bourne \u2014 a large drapery estab lishment in Southampton. At times, however, wiien the whim seized her, she would temporarily under take the post of housekeeper's assistant, or something else of a light nature, at one or other of the places in the neighbourhood. She was a handsome young woman, efficient and useful so long as her good temper held out, but too nearly a chip of the old block to remain tractable for many weeks together. Before the old man could put any more questions, Bob pointed along the sandhills, exclaiming \u2014 \" There's Nan herself, look, all ready to be catechized.\" Nan it was \u2014 a tall, lissom young figure, in a broad hat. She came rapidly along the sandy rise, with blue sea on her left hand, blue estuary on her right, and strong sunshine burning whitely upon the drapery rippled and swung by her quick movements. Keylock laid down his rifle and gazed up the river, while his nephew advanced towards Nan ; then, after a moment or two, he turned to follow Bob, and soon they were all three standing together on the uppermost ridge. The old man thereupon flung himself down on"], [66, "58 A PARSON AT BAY. the sand, paying no apparent heed to the light talk into which the other two fell immediately. \" Well, Nan,\" said Bob, with a chaffy touch of his forelock, \" you han't seen your affectionate cousin for a month o' Sundays. How d'ye bear up agen' my absence, my dear ? I hope you're not pining overmuch ? \" \" Oh, I'm wearing away of course, Bob ; but the sight of you checks decay. You're so handsome and clever \u2014 and always so modest.\" \" Ah ! \" murmured her cousin, with a mock sigh, \" that was always a failin' o' mine ; but for that same modesty I should be owner o' one or two fishin'-boats by now, instead of groomin' the pa'son's horse and diggin' his taters.\" \" How is your master, Bob ? \" \" Pretty well, my dear \u2014 considerin' he's married.

A bachelor may get hove down in a squall for want o' lead on's keel, but a married man's more like to be swamped outright by a paltry sea.\" \" Oh, you're mighty clever, Bob, aren't you ? You re not likely to marry anyway, for who would take you ? \" The girl laughed rather hysterically, then fell into abrupt silence. Bob had a respectful admiration for his cousin, but was too philosophic to allow his heart to be"], [67, "A PARSON AT BAY. 59 entangled by a girl whose father would scout him as a son-in-law. No one in these parts, at least of her own class, would be considered a fitting match for Old Keylock's heiress. The old man was inordinately proud of his handsome black-haired lass, nor was she herself much behind her father in measuring the width of her own horizon. Bob fell to his chaff again, though he was puzzled the while at the behaviour of his two companions. Old Keylock was never one to waste caress-words upon his daughter, but, as a rule, any one who knew him well could detect a lurking prideful affection for her in his every glance and tone. This afternoon he seemed bent upon disregarding her presence. At length Nan made a direct appeal to her father. \" I came out to tell you that the tea is laid and the kettle boiling ; will you come in now ? \" \" Wait ! \" he answered laconically, and without looking at her. Nan winced at her father's tone ; and, now that her light chatter had ceased, her cousin noticed how drawn and peculiar was the girl's expression. It was as though she and her father were both straining after something invisible to a third person \u2014 some thing they dared not speak of to one another ; the mental contemplation of which made each dread the glance of the other, and isolated both for the time being from the rest of the world. Bob could not thus have put into words his"], [68, "60 A PARSON AT BAY. puzzled impressions of the pair, though he would have said \" Yes \" to the words had they been sug gested to him. He had heard them quarrel at times with much heat and clashing of angry words, but this dumb shunning of one another was a phase strange to his experience of them. As Old Keylock continued to gaze up the right bank of the river, Bob followed his glance, and presently detected a large moving object traversing the marsh. \" Hullo ! what's that ? \" he exclaimed. \" 'Tis too big for a dog, I'm thinkin' ? \" But a dog it was, as speedily became apparent, for he was trotting briskly towards them. \" Lord bless me ! \" said Bob, after looking under the sharp of his hand for a moment or two. \" I can spot him now ; 'tis Toro, Captain Aubrey's big St. Bernard. He was loafin' about the Blue Ball as I passed through the village, in charge of one of The Towers servants \u2014 the chap as gave me the beer. I reckon the lazy beggar is still liftin' his elbow, and old Toro has come down along on the spree.\" Old Keylock thrust his hand into the pocket where the cartridges were. His daughter seated herself a little apart from him, rocking herself slightly, and plucking at the tussocks of marsh grass. \" Ho-ho, Toro ! \" shouted Bob, \" have you come a poachin', you scamp ? \" But Toro paid no heed to the shout and the"], [69, "A PARSON AT BAY. 61 waved arm ; he was bent upon a romping, rollicking scramble in the sand, and had no intention of giving up his fun for anybody. In a moment or two he hurtled past the little group, with every muscle starting and great feathered tail wildly waving, and plunged head over heels into a sandy dip. Then he dashed up the succeeding ridge, scattering clouds of sand, and filling the air with his deep-mouthed bay. \" Shall I stop your d \u2014 d bow-wowing or not ? \" muttered the old man, whose eyes were gleaming wickedly. \" Shoot at un ? Good Lord, you ain't such a fool as all that ! \" said Bob, with a short laugh. \" I was doubting a while back whether this here weap'n would clean drop a man, or a big brute like that, and I've a mind to try.\" \" Why, look'ee, old boy, you must be mad-like ! Come, you're jokin', for sure ? \" \" Not joking, but doubting ; for I'm not dead sure whether I've got a grudge agen' that dog's master, or no.\" \" Grudge agen' Captain Aubrey ? Why, he's been a friend o' yourn for the last fifteen year, or more ; never comes home to The Towers for a week without havin' a cruise or doin' a shoot with 'ee ! Have 'ee gone daft, old man ? \" \" Friend or not, it's just possible that I've got an account to settle either with him or with that American at the Castle, which mayhap will total up to somethin' worse than dog-killin'.\""], [70, "62 A PARSON AT BAY. \" I'm a-goin',\" said Bob, abruptly ; \" if you're for takin' pot shots at a gentleman's dog, and that gentleman your own friend-like, I'll just slip my moorin's and run for it. If I stay to look on at that sort o' game, happen my master '11 be made answerable. But yTou're not such a deathy old fool as that, Jeth Keylock, come ! \" \" Clear out and be d \u2014 d to 'ee, then ! \" cried the old man with sudden fury. And Bob went, puzzled and sulky, and inclined to think that his uncle must really have a screw loose somewhere. Old Keylock glanced furtively at his daughter to see if she would add her protest to Bob's ; but Nan sat with her eyes bent upon the ground, still pluck ing the razor-bladed grass, though her fingers were bleeding. As they waited thus in a tense silence that seemed to be gnawing them like a pain, there came a spurt of boy's laughter from a drifting boat in the estuary behind them. Nan shivered at the jarring sound, muttering feebly \u2014 \" Poor old, old Toro, why should you shoot at him, father ? \" She threw a brief scared glance of appeal at the old man ; then turned away her face, unable to bear the gaze of the strong eyes. \" Move back'ards, girl,\" he said roughly ; \" I'm agoin' to shoot that dog.\" The rifle was raised, the old man's elbow resting on his knee as when he shot before.

The great brown and white body, elongated by his climbing posture, and cut out against the silver sand, made an easy mark. He crawled slowdy up the last few feet, then rested his fore paws on the ridge with a low joyous bark. At that moment the rifle spoke, and Nan fell back, half stunned by the report so close to her ear. Then, recovering herself, and peering through the smoke, she saw the long body outstretched as before, resting against the sand in precisely the same attitude. \" Missed ! \" she cried joyfully. \" Now run, good dog ; run before he can shoot again ! \" \" Dead,\" muttered the old man grimly ; \" dead as a door nail.\" And so he was. Toro had had his last scamper."], [72, "A FAR SON AT BAY. 64 CHAPTER V. \" I can get no remedy against this consumption of the purse.\" Shakspere. j^\u00a7|IOME weeks had passed since the Castle garden- mbhi party, and a wave of excitement and bustle was passing over the vicarage of Marsh-under-Cliff ; its whole atmosphere was tingling with expectancy. The little bride, who had been buoying up herself and her husband with promises of a new era, a turning of the financial tide that had been setting dead against them since their marriage, had, in fact, passed with a bound from promise to achieve ment ; the longed-for visit of Maisie's aunt, Lady Wroughton, about whom all the family hopes had been clustering, was about to be accomplished. Aunt Mabel, as she was called, was to arrive this afternoon. Claud Brockenhart breathed more freely to-day than he had done for some weeks past. For, upon bringing home his bride, he had consented, with some misgiving, to one or two small changes in the style of his housekeeping, and was now becoming aware how such mere droplets of additional expense can drain away an income. His first wife \u2014 an"], [73, "A PARSON AT BAY. 65 orphan cousin, whom he had wedded from pure charity and kindness \u2014 had been a consummate manager. She had from the first attuned herself to loyal acceptance of the situation as it stood, setting the household machinery going at half speed, and so keeping it as long as hand and brain could work. Thus the vicar had been able to live on his income, and pursue philosophy, his favourite study, with a quiet mind. But with the advent of brilliant little Maisie the wheels had begun to run more briskly, and the fuel to melt away with cor responding alacrity ; while the value of the living was, unfortunately, declining* also. Almost before he could realize the changed aspect of things, he found himself selling out capital to meet it. It was hard to believe that the mere substitution of cook and housemaid for the single general servant, and other trifling modifications of the sort, could make such a difference ; yet bills had been lengthening like stretched elastic of late, and tradesmen with whom he had dealt for years were beginning to treat him in the curt sharp fashion which makes a man's pride smart, and spoils the flavour of his reading. Yet something nright be said for Maisie's point of view, which was briefly this : \" We must live decently, or fall out of society altogether, and so lose all chance of preferment. Besides, Aunt Mabel has no taste for paupers ; believe me, she's not one of those pitiful women whose purse opens to distress. I would rather appeal to her through our intimacy with Lady Bavant and our position in the county 5"], [74, "66 A PARSON AT BAY. generally, than approach her with any commonplace whinings of the poor-relation order. You remember how she increased my dress-allowance after we dined at The Towers ? I told you it would be so, Claud, when you shivered so at the fly-hire.\" This was true enough ; yet the increase of pin money brought Maisie a keener appetite for society, without helping in any way to satisfy the legitimate hunger of Bavant tradesmen. It was all the harder to restrict Maisie's innocent pleasure, however, since the smallness of her hus band's means was an after-marriage discovery. Claud had conscientiously described himself as a \" poor man ; \" but how much meaning does that common form of words convey ? You will hear a man call himself \" a pauper \" on the ground of only being able to hunt twice a week, or of having to keep but a twenty-ton cutter when his tastes demand a two hundred-ton schooner ; and so this phrase, like a hundred others, gets all the meaning rubbed out of it by usage. Moreover, Maisie was always busy and energetic, doing thoroughly all work that fell to her share. She made many of little Charmian's clothes, and kept the child beautifully dressed ; if she was anxious to play hard, she was willing to work hard also ; and, briefly, the vicar could not attempt to tie her hands further without a creeping sense of meanness and ill-nature. Nor, on the other hand, would he cut down his outgoings to poor parishioners. To him the parish was sacred ; and some less poor than himself took advantage of this"], [75, "A PARSON AT BAY. 67 chivalrous conception of his duty towards his neigh bour. There remained only to cut off his daily newspaper, his glass of beer, and other little personal comforts ; but this lopping of small twigs eased his conscience rather than his purse. At length, however, Aunt Mabel was to put every thing straight again. As a generous sanguine man, simple-hearted enough to think at least as highly of other people's virtue as of his own, he conceived it natural enough that Maisie's aunt, a rich widow, childless and without any special claims upon her, should assist them in a small way. He was not aware that Maisie's allowance was already a hand some one ; nor had he yet realized that mere cash may sit more closely to the human heart than sublime truth, transcendent beauty, or even the deep joys of benevolence. His own attitude towards money had always been a thought too casual, and perhaps his ignorance of its value was a tribute to the unselfish devotion of that first wife who had so completely entrenched him from all sordid cares. From the above sketch of their affairs it will be seen that Aunt Mabel's arrival was a little climax in the Brockenhart family drama : the capture of the well-to-do aunt was to bring down the curtain upon the First Act \u2014 the struggle-time of their wedded life, and therewith a shower of blessings which must needs convert the remainder of the piece into a blaze of sunshine and roses. Nor had they dreamed as yet that their own little private climax could ever send off emotional waves of width and power enough"], [76, "A PARSON AT BAY. 68 to reach such distant points as The Towers, Bavant Castle, and the Black House at the harbour mouth. The family now consisted of four persons \u2014 the vicar and his wife, Miss Charmian, and the vicar's brother Philip, who had but lately returned from his militia training ; and as the small party sat down to lunch on this epoch-making day their talk was naturally of Aunt Mabel, for whose proper reception Maisie was trying to drill her team into shape. Maisie herself sat at the foot of the table, looking very sweet and fascinating in cream-white, touched here and there with a faint blush of pink. Facing her was the vicar, full of sanguine anticipation, though, as usual, a little absent-minded. On his left, and close to his elbow, Charmian was prattling in her high chair, evidently flushed with the prevail ing excitement. Phil Brockenhart had one side of the table to himself, and seemed to occupy most of it. He was one of those men who give one the impression of having double the allowance of arm and elbow usually allotted to human beings; and he had, in point of fact, a special knack of smashing things, and after wards trampling on the wreckage. Indeed, but for his modesty, Phil might fairly have claimed the distinction of originality, for he did nothing quite in the same way as other people. Even his method of handling the fish on his plate just at present was his very own ; he kept lifting it up and slapping it down again, as though hoping to shatter the mass"], [77, "A PARSON AT BAY. 69 by repeated blows instead of dividing it like a mere ordinary mortal. Poor Phil was an ardent soldier, who, after three vigorous but futile efforts to pass for the army, had gently subsided into a militia regiment. Better a halfpenny roll, he thought, than no bread at all ; and better twenty-eight days of war-paint and parade ground than a whole year without one bugle note. And having just enough of his own to live upon, he could afford this annual slight appeasement of his martial cravings ; while for the rest of the year he dwelt at the vicarage, making plans for entering upon this profession or that, according to the ebb and flow of fancy. Phil was a fine young man, but not a handsome one. He had a long face ending in a long promontory of chin, honest eyes, and a genial laugh. Every one, however, save the girls to whom he lost his own heart, was fond of him : the poacher-fishermen, ithe village children, his brother subalterns, the men of his company, all had a soft word for Phil Brockenhart; and nine people out of ten laughed at him as well. Maisie, regarding him now, as she did all persons and things, through the eyes of Aunt Mabel, sighed a little fretfully. Aunt Mabel would but too pro bably take a dislike to him from the outset. His kindliness would have no appeal for her, while his manifest want of savoir faire would be an almost certain irritant. The little bride had been sedu lously preparing Claud lately, hopefully coaching him up to the point of taking a pass degree in the"], [78, "A PARSON AT BAY. 70 forthcoming examination ; and, but for his fatal High-Churchmanship, she would have looked upon him as a likely candidate. As for Phil, however, his case seemed almost hopeless. And so much hung upon the question : their continued social existence, it appeared, hinged directly upon this matter of pleasing Aunt Mabel. Had the case been otherwise, she had humour enough to enjoy keenly its comic possibilities; even as it was, she was pluckily resolved to make the best of things, and now proceeded to take Phil in hand with the genial firmness that marked her tutorial method. \"Remember, Phil,\" she began, \"that I shall look for your assistance when the tug comes.\" \" All right, Maisie ; I'll help to tame the dragon to the best of my ability.\" \" What's a d'agon ? Is Aunt Mabel a d'agon ? \" inquired Charmian, anxiously. Maisie fell back in despair. \" Awfully sorry ! \" muttered Phil, upsetting a tumbler in the fervour of his penitence. \" I'll be more careful \u2014I will really.\" \"No, no, dear,\" explained Maisie to the child. \" Uncle Phil was speaking of that funny old woman who lives by the bridge.\" The vicar winced as though the fib pricked him : Maisie turned again to her pupil. \" Talk about your regiment, Phil ; military talk will always pass muster. And don't forget to mention that officer with a title.\" \" Sir. Brydges Felton ? All right, I'll bring him on"], [79, "A PARSON AT BAY. 71 with the soup,\" Phil answered with a ready chuckle, \" then you can keep Lord Bavant and the other big guns in case she begins to flag later on. The drag \u2014 er \u2014 um ! \" \" Charmie dear,\" put in Maisie, swiftly, \" I think it is time for you to go up to nurse.\" \" No, no \u2014 I want to stay with dad,\" cried the small creature, with a pluck at dad's hand. \" Blessed little woman ! \" muttered the parson. Then Phil approached the child with an insinu ating smile. \"Look here, Charmie, I'll take you up on my shoulder \u2014 and I've got a 'weetie in my pocket.\" In a moment he had carried her off, kicking and chuckling, while a sound of kissing on the stairs suggested that the lollipop had done its work. The vicar said nothing, but looked yearningly at the door, as though he had been robbed of something. \" You must bear up for ten minutes or so, after which you shall rejoin her,\" said Maisie, with a flash of laughter at her husband. \" Ah, Phil, you're back again ? Let us return to our dragon. She is rather a dragon to look at, by-the-by \u2014 tall and sombre, with her skin cut into little shapes and tablets by deep lines, like imitation crocodile on the cover of a blotting-book. Also, she is stiff and pompous, and rather scientific ; you'll hear a good deal about ' adaptation to environment ' (with every syllable dwelt upon), and that sort of thing : but listen deferentially, and you've nothing to fear.

How people can wax so fierce over these twopenny questions I shall never understand.\" \" My dear Maisie ! \" cried the parson, wincing again. \"Yes, yes. I'm a heretic, I know, Claud; but then I always did insist upon my unfitness to be a parson's wife. You declaimed about your poverty, if you remember, and I about my innate dislike of old women, soup-kitchens, Sunday schools, and the rest \u2014 and yet we found courage to get married ! It was one of those acts of sublime audacity which the stupid world accepts as a matter of course, while reserving all its admiration for rescue-feats and such-like crudities. But, depend upon it, the committal of matrimony upon nothing a year is the climax and pinnacle of human daring ; and I'm proud to think that, for once in my life, I played the picturesque heroine.\" Phil, whose admiration for all that Maisie said and did was inexhaustible, laughed boisterously. He was not one of those perceptive persons to whom the lightest of straws serves as a wind-vane. \" Now, Claud,\" proceeded the little wife, plung ing back from rhetoric into business with the swiftness of a diving bird, \"about Aunt Mabel's train ? You will, of course, drive to meet her ? \""], [81, "A PARSON AT BAY. 73 \" Certainly, yes, and I'll take Charmian.\" \" Certainly, no ; I can't think of letting you take Charmian. You'd think of nothing else ; you'd let Aunt Mabel get into a fly and drive off alone, while your little beloved was staring at the puff-puff. No, no ; Robert must take charge of you, with his only livery coat on, and that frightful old tall hat of yours. But see that he doesn't get out of the trap ; those grey trousers of his mustn't be seen on any account ; they would shock Aunt Mabel inexpressibly.\" The vicar laughed genially. He knew himself to be untrustable in the matter of times or trains, and a man can bear to be ordered about a little by a sweet-lipped bride with a voice like a bell. \" Robert shall come, if you like,\" he said, \" and as we pass through Bavant I must look in at the library, for I hear they have just acquired a copy of Spinoza's ' Tractatus Theologico-politicus.' \" \" Indeed ? You alarm me ! And, in that case, I must give Robert strict orders to allow you only five minutes at the library. And now, Phil, for your tour of duty. You must row or sail me down the harbour to the Quay, for there's no fish to be had in the village to-day. We must take Charmian, and by her means wheedle a turbot out of Old Key lock or one of his myrmidons.\" So it was arranged ; and in due time the cart came round to the porch, with Bob Keylock in full panoply of hat and ancient coat."], [82, "74 A PARSON AT BAY. As Bob drew up he caught sight of Mr. Philip, shambling in his loose careless fashion round the corner of the house. \" I say, sir,\" he called out rather peremptorily, \" was you going to take out the sailing-boat ? \" \" Yes, I'm going to cruise down to the Quay with your mistress, Bob.\" \" Then, sir, for God's sake, don't gybe the mast out of the Widgeon,\" commented Bob, who never liked the boat to leave her moorings without him. \" There's a fresh breeze down the harbour, and if you handle the boat in your usual style, she's like enough to turn turtle. Try and avoid gybin' of her ; and, if you must do it, get in some main sheet, and take a turn round the cleat ; and don't shove your helm over as though you was tryin' to burst open a locked gate.\" \" Don't you be alarmed, Bob ; I'm a pretty good sailor-man now, thanks to your tuition. We're going to take Miss Charmie with us.\" \" O Lord ! Hows'ever Pm not her father,\" muttered Bob ; adding aloud, \" Well, sir, if you gybes you drowns, that's all ; and master an' me will be back about six o'clock to pick up the corpses \u2014 that is,\" sinking his voice again, \"if he don't smash me up agen' some post or wall betwixt this and then ! \" \" How's your uncle at the Black House, Bob ? We're going to wheedle some fish out of him, if we can.\" Bob gave a twist of his queer mouth as he"], [83, "A PARSON AT BAY. 75 answered. \" I wouldn't go anigh he just now ; the old man's out o' sorts.\" \" Wants recreation, I suppose ? This is a flat time of year for poachers \u2014 he'll cheer up when the duck and teal come in, eh ? \" Bob shook his head enigmatically, and just then the vicar came forth, looking very dreamy, and with one tail-pocket bulging with books. \" Oh \u2014 er \u2014 Robert \" he murmured vaguely, drawing on his only surviving glove. \" Sir ? \" said Bob, with a lift of his finger. \"Er \u2014 remind me to call at the saddler's, will you ? \" Robert affably consented to exert himself so far ; indeed, despite his innate contempt for book-learn ing which was associated in his mind with a total inability to steer a boat or drive a horse, he was always good-humouredly civil to his master. Pro bably he felt that this careless casual parson would always be in need of his patronage and support ; perhaps, too, he cared rather more for his master than most people would have imagined. \" And I must call upon Mrs. Wilkins in passing,\" murmured the vicar, as he took up his reins. \" Her children have been cutting Sunday school again.\" \" No one else in the parish cares to face that woman,\" thought Bob, \" but, Lord ! he never shirks a dooty, though he's slack enough in his own interests. I wouldn't care to stake a day's wage, for instance, on his meeting my Lady this arternoon ; he'll miss fire yet, like enough.\""], [84, "76 A PARSON AT BAY. CHAPTER VI. \" Why, there's my picture ready made, There's what we painters call our harmony ! \" Browning. ffffniL BEOCKENHAET watched his brother EL-Sll pass safely down the short drive and through the narrow entrance gate \u2014 a feat which the vicar was never quite certain of achieving without detri ment to the flower-beds, then dutifully betook him self to Maisie for fresh orders. The mistress of the house, having now completed her preparations for the visitor's reception, decided that they might take the kettle, and etceteras, on board the Widgeon, and indulge themselves by an afternoon's holiday. \" That will brace us up for the contest this even ing,\" she explained, \"and we can bring the fish home with us.\" Just before they started, however, there was a trampling of horses outside, and two visitors were announced \u2014 Mr. and Miss Otis. \" Ho-ho ! \" cried Phil, who was sewing up a hamper in the dining-room, \" in that case, we'll take them with us.\" Phil happened just now to be rather more in love"], [85, "A PARSON AT BAY. 77 than usual. True, he had met Miss Otis but three or four times, but then he might have urged that better men had succumbed as quickly. Half the young men of the country-side were in a like pre dicament, as sometimes happens when inclination, and \"the smooth fac'd gentleman, Tickling Com modity,\" both pull the same way. An heiress, who is also a pretty girl, may be acquainted with all humau griefs save one \u2014 that of man's neglect. In this case, even Captain Aubrey, the persistent contemner of matrimony, was understood to be a victim, and to have got his sick leave extended with a view to a serious siege of Miss Otis's money-bags. Poor Phil's chances were, in fact, too slender to be worth discussing ; yet, regarding himself, with his \u00a3200 a year all told, as too hopeless a detrimental to be in the running, he felt free to enter his name for the race \u2014 even as a man may, for the mere pleasure of wearing silk and seeing sport, enter and ride his Crock in a regimental steeple-chase. By Maisie, however, the advent of the Otises was greeted with less perfect satisfaction ; her first thrill of pleasure was followed by a quick reaction. Since her first great social triumph at Bavant Castle her conception of the world, and of herself as one of its struggling items, had been radically altered. The possibility of conquering society, despite the smallness of her own social importance, was a highly stimulating discovery. If Aunt Mabel could really be brought to see things from her point of view, and to supply the sinews of war, she,"], [86, "78 A PARSON AT BAY. Maisie Brockenhart, might in time rise to almost any height \u2014 to the height, for instance, where dwelt not only the kind of society that she loved, but possible preferment for her husband. That one triumph had clearly demonstrated her powers ; and subsequent experience had strengthened the con viction that she could do almost what she pleased \u2014 at least with the men. There was Captain Aubrey, for instance ; she knew perfectly well that Dorothy Otis, whom he was supposed to admire, was not really the anchor that held him to these parts. Yet his first attitude towards herself had not once varied, and some instinct told her that it never would. He would always be the same distant reverential worshipper and faithful friend. From him there never would or could be anything to fear; but there was another friendship which could not be regarded with quite the same easy complacence. To know that Hereward Otis, about whom the whole neighbourhood was in such a ferment, was interested in herself, perhaps too deeply for his peace of mind, was enough to turn a stronger head than Maisie's ; but her gratification at the conquest, if such it were, was veined with alarm. She only half understood the artist as yet, which perhaps made him the more attractive in her eyes ; but, even so, she was well aware that he was not the blase society man, somewhat fatigued with the burden of his wealth, for whom the world took him. He might be, and she rather suspected he was, an intense, deeply impressionable man ; in which case he might"], [87, "A PARSON AT BAY. 79 be expected to succumb the more readily for previous self-suppression. This was a fascinating, but rather too piquant hypothesis. She might soon find herself in the undesirable position of a married woman, having every intention of being loyal and faithful to her husband, beset by an admirer who might be ex pected to -lose his head. She had bound herself not to encourage him, and hitherto kept to her self imposed promise, while carefully excluding from her mind the probability that the quiet-friendship treatment might be the most dangerous possible for the patient. To be innocently blind and calmly neutral was easy : to draw the poison from his veins altogether would have called for an honest operation to which she had not yet made up her mind. For the present, moreover, she had one safeguard to be depended upon \u2014 Captain Aubrey's jealous, though unobtrusive, vigilance. Aubrey was as a highly trained watchdog, always on guard \u2014 and he certainly regarded the American as one of the wolf tribe. Much of this passed through Maisie's mind while she touched up her lace collar at the looking-glass, Phil having preceded her into the drawing-room. She soothed her fears, however, with a fresh self lecture, a new little sermon on prudence ; and, thus fortified, felt that her conscience could have no right of objection to any harmless enjoyment that circumstances might offer. When she entered the drawing-room, Otis's"], [88, "80 A PARSON AT BAY. greeting tended to set her more completely at ease. His manner showed the frank cordiality of an admitted friend, with nothing either to fear or to conceal. Though aware that he was deceiving him self, Maisie was willing to endorse the deception in her own interests ; and further, the afternoon programme being already decided upon, a graceful acquiescence therein seemed to be the only course open to her. The brother and sister, it appeared, had called on their way to the harbour, where the artist proposed to do some sketching ; hearing which, Phil had promptly offered to convey them thither in the Widgeon. Miss Otis, however, would not quite accept this offer until Mrs. Brockenhart had been consulted ; Maisie found a deftly arranged loophole ready made for her, if she cared to use it. For a second she hesitated ; but Phil, with his ready awkwardness, metaphorically crushed Miss Otis's neat handiwork underfoot, and settled the question in two words. Even while cordially repeating Phil's invitation, however, Maisie was asking herself, with a furtive tremor, \"Does the artist really mean sketching, or is he merely utilizing these inno cents ? \" \" The innocents,\" in truth, seemed to be the leaders of the party. They did the talking and made the arrangements. Miss Otis hoped that little Charmian would not be omitted, declaring that she would be an addition to the party. Phil stuffed more provisions into the hamper, bustling"], [89, "A PARSON AT BAY. 81 in and out of the room much to the hindrance of other people, and then, in the absence of Robert, went round with Otis to put up the horses. Finally Charmian was brought down, pink with excitement, and the boot-boy was despatched with the hamper. After a brief delay, they started down the drive in a confused group, with Charmian, who always showed a pretty solicitude in the entertainment of visitors, darting hither and thither in search of flowers for Miss Otis. \" She's a sweet little fairy,\" said Dorothy to her Uncle Phil, \" and no wonder her father worships the little thing.\" The speaker paused to accept of an immense peony just plucked by the breathless little woman, and Phil promptly fell back also. Phil's long face was glowing with satisfaction. Otis was civil and friendly to him ; Otis did not treat him like a dangerous lunatic, as the relatives of so many marriageable girls were wont to do ; while, as for Dorothy herself, she seemed rather to like him. However, he resolved, just as Maisie had done, to be as profoundly prudent as was compatible with the extraction of every possible grain of pleasure from the afternoon. As they strolled along he glanced furtively at his companion, wondering whether her dainty riding habit would be quite the right outfit for a scram bling picnic in that rough ex-fishing boat the Widgeon. Yet he would not willingly have had a hair or crease of her altered. She was, in modern 6"], [90, "A PARSON AT BAY. 82 art-slang, \" an arrangement in browns and ambers,\" with nut-brown hair, hazel eyes, clear cream-white skin, and hat and habit of deep rich umber \u2014 and Phil could find no flaw in the \" arrangement.\" Upon reaching the elbow of the vicarage hill, whence the village and estuary first came in sight, Miss Otis halted with an exclamation of pleasure. \" ' Old ' England ? \" she murmured. \" Yes, when I get away from drawing-rooms and tennis-lawns, and look upon a peaceful scene like this, I begin to see how that epithet ' old ' must once upon a time have come warm from the nation's heart. Are you proud of being an Englishman, Mr. Brockenhart ? \" \" Oh yes,\" said ingenuous Phil, \" but I like Americans also.\" \" Well, I must always respect that sentiment \" \u2014 she laughed lightly, perhaps to cover a blush, as she spoke, \u2014 \" but you don't seem to admire the village, and the gleaming river, and the red sails flying over the bar, as I do? Surely one might live here and find that rest and peace which, as far as I can make out, people are always yearning for in vain r Phil Brockenhart, who had \"knocked about a little,\" as the homely phrase goes, and had not his brother's blissful bookish ignorance of men and things, accepted her simplicity as he might* have done the beauty of some rare flower, scarcely venturing to breathe upon it. Rest and peace? He thought of the poaching community, whose white cottages gleamed so"], [91, "A PARSON AT BAY. 83 chastely below ; of the lawless dwellers under the distant roofs of the harbour mouth, burning redly in the sun, which, were it to cease shining upon unjust as well as just, would surely never visit them ; of the wind-blown vicarage behind them, sun-smitten also, but sheltering a grey care that might any day darken ominously. Could he have seen into the hearts of the two who sauntered before him, the mockery of the words might have been intensified ; but, whatsoever he had seen and known, Phil was not sufficiently a young man of his period to force uncomely truths upon the woman he admired. As they passed down through the village, Dorothy noticed how the children ran after Phil and the women came out to greet him. Phil did, in fact, sometimes find his popularity rather a burden. Under present circumstances it was certainly rather awkward to have his healthy looks descanted upon, and praised by old gammers of three score, es pecially as this involved lengthy counter-expositions of their own tiresome ailments. Popularity, more over, lays one open to confidences, and Phil was often better acquainted with the parish's lawless doings than was at all convenient. The mysterious disappearance of Captain Aubrey's dog, for instance, which for some weeks had been causing such a hue and cry, was but a doubtful mystery to \"Master Phil ; \" he felt tolerably certain that some Keylock or Culmer had destroyed Toro in sheer wantonness, and thereafter thrown his body into the sea at such"], [92, "A PARSON AT BAY. 84 a time as would insure its being carried safely out of the bay by the channel ebb. On board the Widgeon \" the innocents \" still held sway. Arcadianism was evidently to be the keynote of the afternoon. Miss Otis undertook to amuse and quiet Charmian, who was apt to be troublesome in her father's absence, while Phil got the canvas on the boat. And as the artist, not being a practical yachtsman, was unable to assist in this task, the fisher-lads ashore enjoyed the relishing spectacle of all Master Phil's tramplings, haulings, and strugglings. At last, however, skipper Phil got the slatting canvas up somehow, and found himself actually under way ; though the unhappy craft certainly had the look of a broken-winged bird, with her mainsail only half peaked-up, and the weather-leach of her gib curved like a sickle. It was a broad reach to the first bend of the river, and the Widgeon slid along gallantly under the smart breeze. At the next point Phil managed to run her aground, and the boat was within an ace of being blown over ; but the luck which appears to attend the unskilful as well as the inebriate befriended the perspiring helmsman, and they dragged through the shallow in safety. Old Keylock, who was lying on the heathery slope halfway between his own sandhills and the headland, grinned sardonically as he watched them through his glass. \"Bob's away,\" he muttered to himself; \"the"], [93, "A PARSON AT BAY. 85 Widgeon has got a \u2014 Brockenhart at her helm, I reckon.\" It seemed to Phil that the boat was aware of Bob's absence, and ready to take every advantage of it. There appeared to be twice the proper number of sheets and halliards aboard, while every one of his passengers had four or five legs at least. Nothing would go right. If he luffed to the squalls the Widgeon got into \" irons ; \" if he kept her a \" good full,\" and sailed her through, she took such a list that all her passengers were thrown to leeward in a heap. In truth, next to a runaway horse, a runaway boat is as awkward a creature as a man need wish to handle. \"I think,\" he suggested, wiping his forehead anxiously as they went ramping down the widening estuary, \" that we had better come to an anchor in the marshy bight, and walk down the sandhills to Old Keylock's. I might not be able to get along side the Quay comfortably in this stiff breeze.\" \" I think so too,\" said Maisie, dryly, \" for, though the water may be warm, we have no desire to bathe in our clothes, I believe.\" Phil shot his boat into the wind, and dropped anchor accordingly ; after which all went well. The passengers and hampers were put ashore in the dinghy, and all but Maisie seemed gratefully con scious of their escape from Phil's nautical clutches. Maisie, however, who had been unusually silent during the voyage, appeared now to have lost all her brightness and spirit. After a steadfast gaze"], [94, "86 A PARSON AT BAY. down the curving shore towards the Quay, she reclined against the gunwale of the dinghy, which was half drawn up on the sand, and sighed heavily. \" I'm afraid I must have frightened you ? \" said Phil, kindly. \"Those squalls were nasty, but I assure you there was no real danger.\" \" Oh no, I'm not frightened ; it's the colour that troubles me.\" \"Eh?\" \" Fine colour affects me as fine music does some people. Look at the water flowing past the Quay, rich-hued as a peacock's neck; and the old em browned piles dipping into it ; and the glint of red roofs against the bleached sandhills, like a splash of vermilion on a silver shield; and the pale turquoise of the lower sky \u2014 Corot's own colour. Ah, I, too, was an artist once ! \" Phil looked sympathetic, but uncomprehending. Maisie was suffering from colour-hunger, the yearn ing for brush and palette, which only the artist of the party could enter into. He looked his com prehension silently. \" Yes, you understand, I know,\" sighed Maisie. \" Now, should I ever have done anything, Mr. Otis ? Speak frankly.\" \" I believe you would \u2014 but only after toiling years of failure. You had the finest colour-faculty in the whole studio, and would have rushed into the midst of things like a Delacroix. But nowa days one must be a finished draughtsman also : you would have had to go back, and go back, until your"], [95, "A PARSON AT BAY. 87 heart was sick ; for you always hated the routine work of art.\" \"Ah, but not so much as I hate that of an ordinary woman's life, with all its household dabbling and drawing-room simpering. Psha ! I should like to live alone with an easel in yonder black house of Old Keylock's, with every room stacked wainscot-deep in paints, and all the walls blank canvas.\" \" You might paint a little, as it is. \" Paint a little ? Do you, an artist, make such a proposition as that ? Am I the sort of person to paint ' sweet little things ' for sympathetic friends to coo over; to pour out my conceptions of what a geranium ought to be, and ask idiots to admire them ? \" \" No, no, you're a true artist at heart,\" murmured Otis, soothingly, \" and the only person in this neigh bourhood whose critical opinion I value one jot.\" \" He certainly doesn't value mine half a jot,\" interpolated Dorothy, with a mock sigh. \" And if I ever have the temerity to admire a piece of his work, he retorts grimly, \" Come, there's hope for me yet \u2014 I shall yet live to please the ass-public ! \" \" Ha-ha ! what queer beggars you artists are ! \" cried Phil. And Charmian, who didn't in the least understand what he was laughing at, promptly added her innocent cackle to his. \" If you'll let me make a suggestion,\" Miss Otis resumed, turning sympathetically to Maisie, \"I should say that to help an artist, and stir the fire"], [96, "88 A PARSON AT BAY. that is in him, must be next best to doing the work one's self. Now, to tell the truth, I've been anxious for some time for my brother to make a sketch of you, and, though I am but a representative of the ass-public, I believe he shares my views for once in a way. He could make a Uttle sketch of you here in half an hour or so, and you could come over and sit to him in the studio another day, if you wouldn't mind the trouble ? \" \" You would confer a real boon upon me by giving me a sitting,\" the artist added, in a tone of which the quietness was belied by his eager eyes. \" Maize is goin' to have her picture done, 'zackly like daddy's,\" cried the little creature, who had fallen, into the habit of calling her stepmother by this pet name, lisping it so prettily that no one had been at pains to check her. \" And can I have it to hang up over my cot, 'side of daddy's picture, Mr. Otis?\" Maisie hung in doubt for a moment, but before she had time to concoct objections the artist was deftly and quickly making his preparations. His outward calmness, and quiet arrangement of pre liminaries, only half-deceived her; she felt that somehow she was upon dangerous ground, that her instinctive shrinking should be accepted as a warn ing \u2014 in short, that she had better refuse. However, before she could quite decide the point, the canvas was adjusted, and the sketch begun. After a time, when once the artist had got fairly to work, Maisie became conscious of something like a creeping"], [97, "A PARSON AT BAY. 89 paralysis of her faculties ; his intense gaze, although she was looking away from him across the harbour, seemed to magnetize and half-benumb her. He had touched her hand once, moving it a few inches, but otherwise had not interfered with her pose. He appeared, for some inexplicable reason, to be nearer to her at this moment than ever before ; he had not opened his lips, yet she felt as though murmured words were coming from them. She tried to shake off the spell by fixing her mind upon sordid home cares and schemes of economy ; but, after forcing herself mentally homewards, could see nothing but the drawing-room, with a handsome olive-skinned visitor rising to greet her. Thrusting aside this picture, she drew herself away to the village \u2014 but still at his side, though his presence depressed her profoundly. The painter, also, was a little beside himself. Though he owned that fine mastery of his material which Paris can give to all those who deserve it, he was now showing no proof of it. The intense con centration necessary for rapid work from the life was impossible to him just now ; he had passed the emotional point where brain gives hand its best cunning. Half his mental power had to be wasted in self-suppression. Presently the sitter took a rest. Phil walked off to the Black House in search of fish, while Miss Otis and Charmian rambled away to the seaward side of the sandhills. After that, Otis became an artist once more. The"], [98, "90 A PARSON AT BAY. salient points of his study came out to meet him ; the intricate mass of drapery \u2014 fold on fold, ripple commingling with ripple \u2014 which a week's hard work might leave half done, was lost, leaving only a kernel, a brief epitome of values and colours, picked out by the brain, as a central idea from a tossing whirlpool of thought. The hand knew its task now, and knew itself capable for it. There was the face, rich, warm toned, crisp as a flower-petal, to be put in true relation to the blue-green water that made so luscious a contrast \u2014 suggested only, however, as a keynote to later studio work ; the leading lines of the perfect shoulders and bust ; the gloss and gleam of falling white drapery \u2014 mere suggestion again ; the slender hanging foot against the grey-white of the dinghy's side ; the curl of lacy emerald sea weed half hiding the other foot. The artist laboured long and strenuously, with the glow of intense and prosperous effort burning in his eyes : then the fire died suddenly, he swept his hand over his forehead as though the strain had become a burden, and uttered an exhausted sigh. He had compassed into a space of two hours the labour which might ordinarily serve for a week's production. \" Let me see it now,\" said Dorothy, who had lately been watching him from a little distance, not daring to utter a word. Maisie looked also, muttering, with a shake of her head, \" You've cured me, you've cured me ! Ten"], [99, "A PARSON AT BAY. 91 years of brush-labour would not have put this in my power.\" Dorothy knew it to be a clever study, because her brother's handiwork, but could not with her own eyes perceive anything very special in it. Maisie's silent depressed admiration, however, assured the artist of what he himself suspected \u2014 that he had surpassed himself. \" When will you let me fetch you over to Bavant, for Harry to make a real picture of you ? \" asked the sister. \" Oh, I don't know,\" Maisie rejoined moodily \u2014 '\u2022 some day or other, perhaps : for the present, you see, we have a relative to entertain.\" \"But you must, Maize, you must,\" urged Char mian. \"Daddy will be so pleased, 'cos he likes Mr. 0 \u2014 tis ; he was sayin' so 'smornin', wastu't he, Uncle Phil?\""], [100, "A PARSON AT BAY. 92 CHAPTER VII. \" Those have most power to hurt os that we love ; We lay our sleeping lives within their arms.\" Beacmont and Fletcheb. ||1|j]0WTABDS evening, when, the wind having Ba.P-l fallen light, the fishing-fleet was drifting slowly up the estuary on the last of the flood, those of the village urchins who chanced to be playing on the bridge enjoyed the rare spectacle of two one horsed Bavant flies. In the foremost of these sat a tall, richly dressed lady, with her maid ; while the second contained such a bulk of luggage as suggested unlimited possible relays of costume as sumptuous as that which clothed the imposing figure. Allowing for a little humorous exaggeration on Maisie's part, the traveller might easily have been recognized from her descriptions as the aunt, whose coming was to be so momentous an event for them all. The lady's skin was certainly drab of hue and deeply wrinkled ; and the level sun-rays of evening emphasized the other plain markings by which Time, the prince of cynics, records his triumph over all things human. The keen glance of the steel-grey eyes had lost its edge ; the somewhat hard mouth"], [101, "93 A PARSON AT BAY. looked none the softer for the strong will which had ordered its workings for so many years ; and between the lines of Time, the World had added much in its own small mean handwriting. Yet Aunt Mabel was not a person to be summed up in a second or two : there was something im pressive and vigorous in her upright carriage and straight gaze ; and, if you cared to look closely enough at an old woman whose physical attractions had long gone the way of her youthful hopes, you might have found a touch or two of pathos beneath the harsher scribblings before mentioned. For the hard woman had in truth known soft moments. A love, sweet as the poet's \"rich spring breeze,\" had once upon a time wrapped her in a strange new atmosphere, swelling in her heart, and threatening to quicken all the barren parts of her character. For three full months this spring breeze of love grew richer, fuller, more dominant ; then her baby died, and soon grief undid all the hope and the promise ; and the flowers died before men could learn to see them. Perhaps every living creature with whom she came hi contact thereafter was an unconscious loser through her loss. Just at present Lady Wroughton's stock of amiability, which, at its best, had to be drawn upon with caution, chanced to be at its lowest level. She liked a man to keep his word ; and when his failure to do so involved a slight to her own consequence, a frost was apt to supervene. Now Mr. Brockenhart had promised, through his"], [102, "94 A PARSON AT BAY. wife, to meet her at Bavant station, but not even a servant had been there to represent him. And how was she to know that her old friend, Miss Crackanthorpe, had assaulted him in the Library on the question of weekday services, and that he had been forced to dip into a book or two in order to cool himself after the encounter ? Bob Keylock had, in fact, extracted his master from the Library just too late to meet the train, and they were now rattling along as fast as the cob would be driven in hopeless stern chase of the two flies. The little misadventure had spoilt everything for Aunt Mabel. She had sat brooding over the slight instead of admiring the richly wooded country about South Bavant, and now found the view from Marsh bridge quite void of charm, the village itself a mere collection of hovels, ancl the parsonage on the bleak hill beyond a dreary enough home for poor Maisie. As the fly slowly mounted the village street Aunt Mabel became aware of a young man, in a tweed suit, rolling awkwardly along with a large flat-fish dangling from his forefinger ; she also noticed with disgust that the fish was alive and quivering. The man was, in fact, Phil Brockenhart, who was, as usual, in a difficulty. Having failed in his errand to the Black House, Phil had remained behind the others to catch the first arrival among the fishing-fleet, and, having"], [103, "A PARSON AT BAY. 95 secured a fine turbot, was now on his way home, anticipating much kudos from the anxious house keeper when he got there. The fishermen had sold the turbot as a dead one, but it now appeared to come to life again ; where upon, being the most humane of men, he paused to give it the coup-de-gra.ee. But a vigorous flat-fish, with no neck to be broken, and no discoverable vital place, is harder to kill than a scandal \u2014 as Phil was soon to discover. Too much bent upon putting the creature out of its pain to notice the aj>proaching flies, he first stalked across the road to the post office, and slapped the turbot against the brick wall with all his force. \" Sickening ! \" muttered Aunt Mabel. The unhappy fish, with a gurgling gasp, and a quick fierce shudder of its whole frame, then ap peared to give up the ghost. Phil marched on, relieved, with the damp corpse flapping against his leg. Yet, before he had gone ten yards further, the poor turbot was wriggling' as hard as ever, and curling itself up like a wave about to break. \"D \u2014 n the fish ! \" cried Phil, angrily. Several youths were now collected round him, jeering and chuckling boisterously. \" Take he home and sleep on un, mister,\" said one, \" and he'll be most dead afore mornin' ! \" \" Put 'im in a bucket of water and fish for un with a rod and line \u2014 he'll give rare sport ! \" cried another. \"Use un for a cushion in church,\" suggested a"], [104, "A PARSON AT BAY. 96 third, \" and happen you'll keep awake through the sermon next Sunday ! \" Phil was by this time getting vicious. He looked round for some one big enough to spend his wrath upon, and, finding a strapping youth of eighteen in full guffaw, he brought the turbot down on the youth's bare head with a sounding slap, evoking a jet of shocking language which the roar of the others but partially drowned. Then, seeing that half the village was round him, and the approaching carriages blocked by the crowd, Phil cast his burden down in a fury, and battered out the poor remnant of life with a heavy stone. \" Come in and have a glass o' ale, Mr. Philip,\" said Mr. Tucker, the landlord of the Stone Curlew, as he stood on the inn doorstep, wrestling with his laughter, and Phil sneaked in at once, thankful to hide his head. \" Who was that gentleman ? \" asked Lady Wroughton of her driver, with a look of profound disgust at the vanishing figure. \"Mr. Phil Brockenhart, mum, the vicar's brother,\" said the man, with an appreciative chuckle, adding inwardly, \" Whoever seed the like o' them two brothers for getting iuto awk'ard corners ? \" \" Drive on at once ! \" the lady rejoined sharply, muttering in her turn. \" Cursing and swearing, brawling in the village street, and drinking in a common public-house ! A pretty sort of family the vicar's must be ! \" Five minutes afterwards, Maisie, seeing her aunt"], [105, "A PARSON AT BAY. 97 arrive alone, and with a lowering countenance, felt her heart sink ominously. Aunt Mabel, however, who was really fond of her little niece, greeted her not unkindly, and kept back the story of the turbot for the present. But, unfortunately, this reticence had the effect of establishing her husband as the sole offender in Maisie's eyes ; the whole weight of her just wrath, some of which should have been diverted Phil wards, began to pile itself up in readiness for the offending vicar. Claud drove hastily up just as the visitor, having finished the inevitable cup of tea, had withdrawn to change her travelling dress. He found Maisie alone in the dining-room, and before he could utter a word, she fell upon him \u2014 not loudly or crudely, but with quick stinging wasp-words, uttered in a low tone, which brought the blood to his face in a moment. His tongue retorted in kind before his will had time to check it. Then they fell back from each other in trembling silence. For this, their first interchange of downright angry words, was a little epoch to them both. It needs but a small quarrel to rub the bloom off a home idyll ; and to Claud, at least, their domestic life had as yet been idyllic, despite financial anxiety. To him Maisie was still a fairy bride, to be loved and worshipped, and revelled in as a sweet-breath ing romance. Her religious lightness might have caused him a private pang or two ; but much 7"], [106, "98 A PARSON AT BAY. reading had not lessened his charity, and his heart was an ever-ready counsellor for the defence of the young girl who had entrusted her life to his keeping. \" Maisie, dear,\" he said, quickly, \" I'm sorry ! \" He stood very well with her at this moment. He had shown to begin with, a spirit, for lack of which she would have despised him ; and now showed another kind of spirit, which she secretly admired. Her burst of discontented longing this afternoon, too, had issued in a healthier reaction ; and perhaps a lately dis covered weakness, or potential weakness, had induced compunctions leaning towards a sounder faithful ness. But if it takes two to make a quarrel, assuredly it takes them both to make it up again. Maisie had not the affection for which his eyes asked plainly, and whose warmth would have made kind feeling blossom into kind words. She hung back, with flushed cheeks and long lashes fluttering, while the keen hope of his glance was cooling to dull pain. \" Well, let us say no more,\" he muttered, dropping the hand which was reaching out for hers."], [107, "A PARSON AT BAY. 99 CHAPTER VIII. \" There babbles from chair to chair A little sweet face That's a gleam in the place With its little gold curls of hair.\" Bennett. WM HE hapless turbot was, after all, relegated aiiiil to the nourishment of the kitchen-folk, instead of being placed before the august visitor ; for when Maisie heard of the poor criminal's public execution before her aunt's very eyes, with all its indecorous accompaniments, she felt that its appear ance at table would be little short of an outrage upon her guest's feelings. Moreover, Phil declined to face the stranger at all if there were any danger of the fish's reappear ance, declaring roundly that, rather than face such an ordeal, he would dine in his bedroom or the back kitchen. He was much mortified at his signal failure to subserve the family interests. \" Claud neglects her, to begin with,\" he said ruefully to the little mistress of the house, \"and then I stamp in the bad inrpression by a slaughter house scene in the village street. We've killed your chance between us, for women are frightfully"], [108, "A PARSON AT BAY. 100 unforgiving. I shan't have the face, now, to dine in my mess-kit, which you thought might be an acceptable compliment to her mightiness. My face will be like a geranium ; no need for any scarlet on my back, I do assure you ! \" \" Well, we must make the best of it, Phil,\" \u2014 the little woman's mettle was, as usual, answering to the spur of difficulty ; \" and there's my trump card, Charmian, to be played yet.\" \" The child's looking pale to-day, and less pretty than usual ; and who can say what her mood will be ? She may flatly decline to look at the stranger.\" Charmian was certainly an unknown quantity, which Maisie, with some dim recollections of school room algebra, had lately been trying to equate with those two other doubtfully known quantities, Phil and her husband. But her algebraical attempts resulted only in a tangled mass of x's and y's, from which never a value could be deduced. And to further baffle all calculation, there was that utterly unknowable factor, the church. A single Sunday morning service, even a single glance into the sacred building, might undo all the good impressions producible by the combined efforts of the family. \" We'll face the enemy in black, then,\" she now rejoined recklessly, \" and I'll manipulate your tie for you. Courage, Phil ; and concentrate your mind upon Sir Brydges ! Don't appear until the gong sounds, however ; the bad quarter of an hour is not the time for a culprit's entry upon the stage. I shall"], [109, "A PARSON AT BAY. 101 bring you on with the soup, and perhaps my aunt's resentment against you will blunt her perceptions as to the badness of our sherry. Now I must go and see to Claud's dressing, lest haply he should come clown in a boating-coat.\" For the next half-hour, the lower part of the house was wrapt in silence ; then Aunt Mabel rustled solemnly into the drawing-room in black silk, followed by Maisie, ravishingly arrayed, and looking ready for all possible developments. Mr. Brockenhart made his appearance a moment or two afterwards. Maisie was rather inclined to feel proud of her husband as he entered. His fair complexion, flushed a little by excitement, looked well, and his thick chestnut hair made a good setting for his fine forehead ; ancl the old dress-coat sat well upon his tall, slight figure. \" Claud may not be actually handsome,\" she mused approvingly, \" but he certainly has the look of a scholar and a gentleman.\" Lady Wroughton's silent verdict was : \" Refined and thoughtful, if somewhat weak; the man will probably talk well, at least on his own subjects.\" The vicar's opening apology, too, had the grace which comes of genuine feeling. He spoke his reo-rets with the frank penitence of a generous schoolboy. The visitor accepted them in majestic silence, with the look of a queen whose gentleman-usher sues for pardon. It was part of her conception of"], [110, "A PARSON AT BAY. 102 herself, as a personage of importance, to preserve an artificiality of manner hardly suited to the nine teenth century. She liked people to realize at once that she was no mere Englishwoman of the period. Mr. Brockenhart's anxious politeness was some what dashed by the excessive dignity of its recep tion ; so far her success in making her host uncomfortable was satisfactorily complete. But he was not egotistical enough to look upon his failure as a tragedy, and humbly conceiving that Maisie would be found more acceptable, he handed the charge of the conversation over to her. Sometimes a modest man will thus escape with a small wound, where an egotist must needs suffer annihilation. Aunt Mabel, however, had no idea of letting him escape thus easily ; it was fitting that he should feel the full weight of her superiority, which, as a mere by-listener, he could hardly be made to do. Accordingly she begun to question him upon the fauna and flora of the district, guessing with intuitive shrewdness that he would know nothing whatever about bird, beast, or flower. Natural history was, in fact, almost the only subject into which Claud had never looked. Nor could Maisie do anything to assist him, for there are moments when the most consummate tact is more helpless than infantile simplicity. Yet, on the whole, the best policy was, not to divert the stream, but to encourage it. At any rate, Aunt Mabel's resentment appeared to melt"], [111, "A PARSON AT BAY. 103 with each fresh exhibition of her opponent's ignorance. \"It would appear,\" she remarked, after a time, in a voice touched with dry triumph, \"that you have not included these subjects in the course of your reading, Mr. Brockenhart ? \" \" I fear that is but too apparent,\" he answered, with a laugh, \" ancl, to tell the truth, I only care for the philosophy of science ; the dry bones never did interest me.\" This was a bad stroke, as faintly suggesting his contempt for those who give their lives to the investigation of the said bones. \"Yet I should have imagined that even the smallest detail of the Creator's handiwork might be considered worthy the serious attention of one of His ministers ? \" Now a hint of religious exhortation will sometimes act as an irritant even upon a humble ancl devout man \u2014 as it did upon Claud Brockenhart now. He was rasped and annoyed; vexed with himself for being so, and thereby the more annoyed. His adversary, on the other hand, was naturally gratified \u2014 the probe in her deft fingers had evidently touched upon spiritual pride. But Maisie knew that this success would make her aunt more aggressive, and that Claud, once seriously attacked, was likely enough to develop dangerous warmth. Nor could Aunt Mabel now be diverted from her prey by any conversational sally, and so the unknown quantity in the nursery,"], [112, "104 A PARSON AT BAY. which Maisie had proposed to hoard up for to morrow, must needs be utilized at once. The little hostess, indeed, felt rather like a general about to launch his cavalry against an unbroken enemy ; but, after a brief question to Aunt Mabel, she rang the bell firmly nevertheless. \" Tell nurse that Lady Wroughton would like to see Miss Charmian before she goes to bed.\" This brief order meant, of course, that Miss Charmian, primed with chocolate creams, straitly exhorted to be on her best behaviour, and faultlessly equipped from head to foot, was to be brought down at once. The nurse's knock was heard almost immediately, and a tiny white figure, sashed ancl trimmed with pale yellow, and crowned with hair of pale shining gold, became visible in the doorway. \"It is no use; she has a shy fit on. I've squandered my only reserve for nothing,\" thought Maisie ; adding aloud, \" Come in, Charmian dear.\" Charmian came in ; but instead of prettily ad vancing to offer her hand to the stranger \u2014 as she would always do when it didn't matter much \u2014 made a quick bolt to her father's chair, ancl clasped him tightly round the neck. The vicar began to mutter in her ear, ancl the pair seemed for a moment to have escaped into another world. \"There's another offence,\" thought Maisie, \"for she'll make no allowance for a father's weakness \u2014 the father being a vicious High Churchman.\" But, had she ventured to study her aunt's face"], [113, "A PARSON AT BAY. 105 just nowT, Maisie might have seen a slight spasm pass over it, and a twilight gleam flow into the hard eyes, and a faint movement shake the lips, like the stirring of a tired Hope in its sleep. Aunt Mabel watched the gold hair mingle with the chestnut ; then looked away, as though ashamed of some unconfessed weakness. Her baby had been a girl. \" How old is the child ? \" she asked, after a pause, in a perfectly commonplace tone. As the words were spoken, little Charmian, yield ing to the silent paternal will-pressure, wavered across the room, and stood before the visitor with uplifted face. Maisie expected to see the cheek coldly patted, ancl to hear further commonplaces ; but the stern head clipped, the tall figure bent slowly, and for a second or two Charmie half disappeared. On re emergence she was found to be seated on the tall figure's knee. \" Would you like to see daddie's photogass, and Maize's, and mine ? \" she then asked suddenly, with a bewildering plunge into her normal loquacity. Aunt Mabel smiled. It was the first smile of hers that Claud Brockenhart had witnessed, ancl had an oddly relieving effect upon him. He sighed pleasantly; and the pose of his limbs and whole figure was relaxed as though stiffening wires had been withdrawn by an invisible hand. Charmian, flushed by her conquest or by the smiles of \" Maize \" ancl her father, next proceeded"], [114, "106 A PARSON AT BAY to collect all the reachable photographs in the room, and came babbling back to stack them on Aunt Mabel's lap ; whereupon Maisie, casting a tactician's eye over the field, vanished for a moment or two. So much good complacence on the visitor's part, she concluded, must be neither wasted nor checked ; Phil must be \" brought on \" before the smiles waned, and Charmian must be kept up, for once, to prolong them \u2014 at least for the most difficult half of the dinner-hour. Phil, on receipt of a pre-arranged signal, entered accordingly, and felt his reception to be far above his deserts. Aunt Mabel accepted his opening platitudes so far graciously that the pressure of the turbot upon his heart began to lessen immediately. He really impressed the visitor rather favourably, as having a better gift of small talk than his brother. Indeed Phil could gossip like an old woman with or without a topic ; and his long face, if plain, was quaint ancl humorous, and his genial laugh contagious. Charmian, however, was the real heroine of the little play. She it was who saved the situation, giving the crushed family time to stiffen their courage ancl recollect their parts. Phil recaptured Sir Brydges Felton, lately chased from his mind by stress of circumstance, while Maisie carefully reviewed the district, ranging in order all the big puppets to be handled during the meal. Their gratitude to Charmie was in truth profound ; and could their respective feelings have found vent, the flood of"], [115, "A PARSON AT BAY. 107 encomium might well have served to spoil the child for a twelvemonth to come. WThen the gong sounded, ancl the vicar gave his arm to Lady Wroughton, they were no longer a mere forlorn hope, but a party braced by the prospect of a task that could be faced without serious dread of failure. Charmie was placed in a high chair near her father, flushed and excited, but sufficiently awed by the flower-trimmed table, the dresses, and general solemnity, to be easily kept in hand. It w as now Maisie's turn to show the menkind how a quick little woman can trim sail to a fair wind. She started with the advantage of having a definite objective ; to wit, a weak point in her adversary, well known and often previously explored. For Aunt Mabel possessed, as has been already hinted, the amiable surface weakness, or deep corroding defect (for some lean to this view, some to that), of excessive respect for Purse and Place ; sufferers from which trouble are vulnerable even by the least skilled hand. In this individual case, too, the weakness may have been amiable, but was certainly not superficial ; it was part of the bed rock of Aunt Mabel's character. Nor was the growth in any way connected with unsatisfied longing, for she had, during her husband's lifetime, seen a good deal of many kinds of great people. Sir Hastings Wroughton was a public man of distinction, who had done his country real service ; also a large-hearted, many-sided man, who liked to"], [116, "A PARSON AT BAY. 108 gather round him the great in science, art, and philosophy. Moreover, it was a known fact that, just before his death, a peerage had been actually hovering over his head, ready at any moment to perch upon his broad shoulders. In short, his wife had lived in a brilliant circle, ancl explored more than one stratum of society ; yet, after his death, her old friends had somehow fallen off \u2014 either through Fortune's ill-nature, or though her lack of some quality or other which, in the absence of great wealth or commanding position, has power to check the centrifugal forces of Society. At any rate Maisie shrewdly suspected that her aunt was now bending her eyes abroad for want of proper appreci ation at home ; in which case the problem was how to keep her anchored, at any rate for the present. Maisie now began to produce puppets from her invisible box with the deftness of a conjurer. Talk of scenery in geneial led to that of the Bavant neighbourhood : scenery without figures fails to interest ; so the figures came on quite naturally \u2014 the largest first. Mr. Brockenhart listened with a kind of wonder to this artful drugging of their guest, and with amazement at her thirsty acceptance of a medicine whose efficacy he had never, till now, fully realized. Aunt Mabel was refreshed and humanized by a treatment which his own stomach would have rejected with nausea. Even the fumes of the medicine were to him demoralizing ; insomuch that he presently found himself, in flat contradiction to the normal"], [117, "A PARSON AT BAY. 109 delicacy of his mind, bluntly thrusting upon his visitor certain lofty, though distant, connections of his own. Sinking in his owm respect, he rose in hers ; while Phil plunged after him, with Sir Brydges Felton and one or two other w-ealthy brother officers. Only once during this successful meal did Aunt Mabel refer to the local avi-fauna. \"Judging from the look of the country north wards,\" she remarked to Phil, \" I should imagine that goatsuckers would be found in your neigh bourhood ? \" Phil glanced at his brother, who did not know hawk from hernshaw, or mavis from merle ; but neither felt certain what a goatsucker might be \u2014 whether bird, beast, or fish. But once more little Charmian came to the rescue. \" Do you mean a nanny-goat, Aunt Mabel ? The coastguard has got a nanny-goat. You might come to see him with nurse and me some day, if you liked ? The coas'guard goes to milk him with a little tin can ; and when I'm a bigger girl he says I may milk him all by myself. I 'spect you'd like to milk him too, wouldn't you ? \" \"A goatsucker, otherwise known as Fern Owl, Night Jar, and by other names,\" explained Aunt Mabel, rather severely, \" is a bird.\" \" Is it a rare bird ? \" Maisie asked quickly, with an interested glance at the speaker. \" What are the special points of a goatsucker ? \""], [118, "110 A PARSON AT BAY. \" Oh, a nightjar ? Why, of course, \u2014 I remember killing one with a catapult when I was a boy,\" put in Phil, with the crass awkwardness of over-anxiety. \" I dare say you do, Mr. Brockenhart ; boys are the most odious and repulsive little slaughterers in existence.\" \" Certainly ; they are indeed. Why, I remember stoning a poor heron to death when I was a youngster, and it took nearly half an hour to do it!\" \" You appear to have the will to destroy, though not the skill,\" was the lady's icy comment ; \" and next time you purchase a fish, for example, I should recommend your first having it put to death by some competent person.\" Phil blushed vividly, answering only by a shattered sort of smile. But the delivery of a rebuke is to some people a soothing process, ancl Aunt Mabel showed no signs of relapsing into gloom. Indeed, the rest of the evening passed smoothly enough, with a little music from Maisie, some further parading of titled puppets, and much deferential listening. AVhen the visitor retired for the night, Phil drew a deep breath, and swung his shoulders as though just relieved from a yoke. \" It has been rather a tough ordeal, eh, Maisie ? Thank goodness the Dragon has gone to her lair at last. She hangs about my mind like a bad dream. I've been no better than a sneaking toady to-night, a fawning spaniel ready to crouch at a word; and"], [119, "A PARSON AT BAY. 111 were she to open the door again now, I should sink back to that level in a moment. Nothing but fresh air ancl strong tobacco will serve to rid me of your aunt, so I'm off for a stroll on the cliff. Good night, fellow sufferers ! \" Maisie, who had steered the difficult aunt through a long evening with so much address, was now preparing a bad move. Like many other people, she had a keen psychological vision for the lower phases of human nature, but was rather dim-sighted when reviewing the higher. With persons like Aunt Mabel, the smallest twitch of a facial muscle would serve to put her upon the right track ; while, in studying men like her husband, she often forgot to first raise her eyes to a higher level. Thus, presuming that Claud would now be sharing her own gratification at an honourable victory, she conceived it a good moment for wheedling a favour out of him. \" We have made a fair start, dear,\" she began, cheerfully, \"ancl have now some excuse for being hopeful. I shall drive Aunt Mabel to the Grange to-morrow, and, as Miss Crackanthorpe is an old friend, an invitation may come of the visit. When tired of us she might adjourn to the Grange, and, of course, it will be politic to keep her in the district as long as possible. And you will have little trouble with her now ; I shall relieve you of her during the day, and Charmie, to whom she has evidently taken a fancy, will be at hand to tide us over bad moments. The only thing I'm seriously"], [120, "112 A PARSON AT BAY. afraid of is the Sunday service. Now, couldn't you, just to oblige me, dear, do without some of the music on Sunday morning \u2014 say the anthem, at any rate? Remember, all church music is popish in her estimation.\" \" That's out of the question, Maisie, and you ought to have known it.\" The vicar was never weak on a point of con science; and he was even more sore than Phil at the part thrust upon him by circumstances this evening. It hurt him to be asked to lower himself still further. \"It's a bad thing to be poor,\" he muttered, striding restlessly about the room, \"one begins to realize how bad a thing. A competence is a kind of flower-garden, in which a man's finer feelings can grow and flourish ; while outside it you have nothing but such rank weeds as we have been wading through to-night.\" \" But we have not a competence, Claud ; and, following out your simile, you can't grow hothouse flowers in a wind-blown potato field. We must needs keep our finer feelings, I suppose, until we acquire a seed-ground of some sort. Meanwhile, we have bills to pay, and Charmian to educate. She will be wanting a governess soon. And she's not at all strong. I suspect Dr. Brading was right in saying that she ought to be away from the seaside for some months out of every year. Then change of air, like everything else, costs money.\""], [121, "A PARSON AT BAY. 113 \" The little thing ! \u2014 yes, yes, we are poor,\" he sighed. \" More so than I ever imagined when \" Maisie stopped abruptly as his eyes met hers. \" That was hardly generous, Maisie ; but I accept your blame. I wasn't careful enough to impress upon you the smallness of my means. You must forgive me, and \u2014 let us help each other to bear any trouble that comes, dear ? \" \" You know very well that I never could say gushy sentimental things, Claud ; and I can't pretend to feel other than sore and disappointed with you. I'm going up now ; you'll find a candle in your dressing-room.\" It was long, however, before any use for the candle was found. The parson lingered below stairs, pondering, perhaps, upon the flower-garden of his simile ; wondering how it should come to pass that a man's nearest and dearest may stride to and fro in it like an enemy, scorning its beauties, killing its peace, treading its blossoms underfoot. S"], [122, "A PARSON AT BAY. 114 CHAPTER IX. \" How might I do it, pat.\" \u2014 SfiAKsrEF.E. H'HJHE highest point of the vicarage ridge was Jalal the furzy crown of the headland in which it terminated; and this commanding spot had lately become a favourite look-out station with Old Keylock. He would lie for hours on the narrow chine of the headland, with the two wide bays beneath stretching away to his right and left, and the hoarse murmur of the grounds well in his ears. From this vantage-point he could survey the scenes which had made the setting of his own history, for, by a mere turn of the head, the harbour, the glistening estuary with its marshes, ancl a broad spread of the inland country were all brought into view. The wild scenes of his youth, the alarums ancl excursions of old smuggling days, had, until lately, grown somewhat dim in his memory. They formed a proud past, a fitting background for a strong man to stand up against ; but, middle age once left behind, there had been no serious longing for the old strenuous times, until just lately. This year,"], [123, "A PARSON AT BAY. 115 however, there had been a change : even in the few weeks since our first meeting with him on the sand hills the change had become more marked. The whole space of the man's mind and heart was darkened, and pain of soul had brought with it an itching desire for the antidote of bodily peril. Nevertheless, despite this odd half-youthful recoil, the man was conscious that now at last old age had him fast. Heart-ache had aged him ; had estab lished in his mind an idea that had hitherto been denied entrance, ancl taught him once for all that he was mortal. It had been his habit to put aside the question of death as unsuitable for the consideration of hale strong men, but with a private admission that a clay of reckoning would come for him, as for others ; ancl that, when the body failed, he would not disdain to make his peace with his Judge. Nor, until now, had he seen any special cause to dread that final casting up of accounts. He had been, at least according to his lights, perfectly honest ; just and straightforward ; no coward ; no robber of other men's honour. His smuggling exploits never had lain, and never would lie, heavy upon his conscience ; and his poaching was not less justifiable in his own sight. He held the not uncommon opinion that all really wild creatures, fish or fowl, were fair game for any man, if killed in a fair way ; yet, like many old-fashioned poachers, he would as soon have thought of touching one of Lord Bavant's corn-fed pheasants as of stealing a fowl from a farm yard ; wherefore the worst doings of the Quay lads"], [124, "116 A PARSON AT BAY. had to be kept dark from Old Keylock. Indeed, he had at times meted out sharp justice to some of the boldest offenders ; and one night, when a trout stream of his lordship's had been poisoned, there had to be a spell of fighting on the Quay before the chiefs authority could be fully asserted. Again, although in the pursuit of his old trade he had seen some sharp skirmishes, he had been fortunate enough to deal no fatal wounds. Once, ancl once only, had he taken life \u2014 ancl that under great provocation, and not in the course of his profession. Five and twenty years ago a certain coastguard had come hankering after his wife, ancl Keylock had shot the man dead. About that crime, which had gone unpunished all these years, he had never felt entirely easy in his mind ; but, on the whole, the old man was of opinion that he might face the eventful payment of nature's debt without womanish qualms \u2014 or, at any rate, such had been his verdict upon himself in rare moments of self arraignment. But, now that the adjustment of accounts was making a swift stride from distant horizon to near foreground, and the crowning improbability, old age, had become a present actuality, his confidence was shaken. He had done nothing as yet ; but what was he watching the harbour for day after day ? \u2014 a living target ? So it seemed ; yet even in this connection there were creepings of self-doubt. Brooding upon revenge, by sapping his strength, had forced him to"], [125, "A PARSON AT BAY. 117 realize his age, ancl that in its turn now appeared to be corroding his power of revenge. When he first read the story of his daughter's face, which, now that her mother was dead, no one else could have clone so readily, he had sworn to himself that, when suspicion became certainty, Nan's betrayer should die. The certainty had come, his hope had passed through the death-throe, and was gone ; yet his purpose was already half blunted. There were times, even, when he could have cried with the Prince of Denmark, whose weakness he would have scoffed at theoretically : \u2014 \" Yet I, A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak, Like Jolm-a-dreams, unpreguant of my cause, And can say nothing.\" Y'et assuredly a small thing wrould suffice to re establish his purpose. The discovery of Nan's f secret by her neighbours might cure his infirmity at a stroke. For the present it was a secret, thanks to her habits of proud aloofness from the Quay folk, ancl to the tide-channel which favoured this isolation. Or again, could he but satisfy his mind as to which of the suspects was the real culprit, his courage would return. Nothing was to be got out of Nan herself. Threats had no meaning for a girl upon whom despair was daily taking a firmer hold ; indeed, if overpressed, she was likely enough to throw herself some night into the deep tide-channel that swept past their door-step \u2014 ancl then what hope of finding the guilty party ?"], [126, "118 A PARSON AT BAY. Naturally his purpose grew feeble when its ap parent object changed half a dozen times a day. Captain Aubrey, he would argue, was most intimate with Nan ; in fact, there had been for many years a relation of a close and special kind between the ex-smuggler and the earl's brother. It was Old Keylock who had first taught Ulick Aubrey, the jolly schoolboy, to sail a boat and shoot a wild duck. The bold youngster had always been a lad after his own heart ; and nothing had ever occurred to unloose a friendship formed while the younger heart was fresh. Aubrey seldom, if ever, came home without making a cruise or two with Old Keylock ; for a night's sea-fishing would always be acceptable as a mild relaxation after town dissipations. Moreover, he had a taste for rough work with the wildfowl, and not one of The Towers' keepers could pretend Ho Keylock's consummate knowledge of mallard, teal, or widgeon. The arrogant old man had never dreamt of possible danger to his daughter from this intimacy. Nan was, like himself, strong, proud, immaculate. His girl was not like other men's ; she had been to school with the daughters of gentlemen ; she was a piece of himself, one of the incidents in the long tale of his superiority to the world at large. It cut his pride to the quick ever to suspect Aubrey, his pupil \u2014 almost his friend \u2014 of so wronging him. Now, the gentleman at Bavant Castle, where Nan had been domiciled in the early part of the year, was a stranger ancl a foreigner, the possibility of"], [127, "A PARSON AT BAY. 119 whose guilt could be dwelt upon with very different feelings. Ancl latterly the old man, trom his favourite post on the highland, had been closely studying the American's movements. He noted how frequently Otis came rowing clown the harbour, and loitering about with his painting-stuff anywhere between Marsh bridge and the tarred house. That was suspiciously hopeful ; but Keylock had never actually seen him in conference with Nan, and could get no definite evidence against him. In this manner the old man was mentally tossed to and fro day after day, battered now on this side, now on that, by suspicions which he could never resolve into certainty ; ancl, thus tormented, he was lying stretched on the furzy headland on the morning after Lady Wroughton's arrival at the vicarage. Sweeping the estuary and marshes as usual with his telescope, he descried, after a time, a figure advancing along the south bank of the river. \" Captain Aubrey,\" he muttered, after further scrutiny, \" and he has come about that dog again, I reckon. He shall hear news this time.\" Ulick Aubrey had more than once visited the village and Quay on this errand, but hitherto Key lock had kept out of his way, perhaps dreading to confirm painful suspicions. The old man now re solved to confront and accuse Aubrey, and so allay his miserable doubts once for all. When the approaching figure reached the verge of the marsh, Keylock stood up and waved his arm."], [128, "120 A PARSON AT BAY. Aubrey, who seemed to be making for the Black House, evidently saw him, and struck off southwards towards the bluff, soon afterwards disappearing in its hollow. Old Keylock then lay down again, breathing heavily. His strong hands shook like a frightened woman's ; his desire that Aubrey should clear him self grew intense enough, as the slow minutes passed, to rack him like a pain. At length Aubrey's broad shoulders rose above the crest of the ridge, and his first words fell jarring upon the old man's tense nerves. \" A cursed steep hill, Keylock, for a man out of training ! \" The speaker then flung himself down beside the old man, and drew out a flask. \" Have a chink, Keylock ? \" \" I can't drink with 'ee, Master Ulick \" \u2014 the old name slipped out suggestively ; Keylock had been living in the past during the quondam pupil's ascent to the hill. \" Not drink, man ? I suppose it goes against your conscience to touch unsmuggled liquor ? How ever, I don't know that I cared much for strono waters myself till I came to discover that life isn't worth having ; whereas now \u2014 I'm not quite a tee totaler.\" \" What's your grievance agen' life just now, sir ? \" \" I'm stone broke ; that's the main grievance.\" \"You was stone broke two years agone, Mr."], [129, "A PARSON AT BAY. 121 Ulick ; and once afore that, I mind : but his lord ship pulled you through fast enough.

Why, if I had lived in the days ot Wel lington, I might have made a fair show enough. I'm not a bad lot at bottom ; with a decent chance, ten years ago, I need never have become a curse to my people : whereas, I tell you, Keylock, that if my brother knew the total of my debts now, he'd only regret that I hadn't blown out my brains long ago. Yet he's such an awfully good chap,\" concluded the speaker, with a sigh, \" that he talks of whitewashing me once more, for the last time.\" \" Oh, o' course, o' course ! \" muttered Keylock, bitterly, \" the dirt'll be brushed off fast enough, just as I said.\" \"Don't be so sure of that. There's a condition attached to the whitewashing \u2014 an impossible one, too.\" \"What is it, Mr. Ulick?\" \" That of becoming engaged to a certain American heiress,\" answered Aubrey, with a rueful laugh, ancl another lift of the flask to his lips. \" I shall have to offer myself, just to satisfy him ; ancl she'll laugh in my face. Why, damme, she's got admirers enough to make up two cricket elevens, and the luck always was against me.\" \" ' No luck ' is the cuckoo-cry of every bungler,\" muttered the old man. \" I was within an ace of landing a pile at Kempton Park in March, but the tip came just too late.

'\u25a0 l'ou'd better mind yourself, sir ; a sharp puff from the north would topple you over ; and 'tis two hundred and fifty foot clear, with sharp rocks to fall on.\" \"Well, that should suffice to finish even me, though bad lots take a deal of killing, I believe. How do you expect to go out of the coach, Key lock ? \" \"Out on the reef yonder some dark night, I reckon.\" \" Ha-ha ! \" jeered Aubrey, who, after finish ing the whisky flask, felt the need of railing at another as well as himself, \" you consider Jeth Keylock too big a man to die tamely in his bed, of course ? \" The old man gazed seaward, musing silently. The breeze being off shore, and the air washed clear by late rains, the water in the bays was oil smooth, with its rich tones deepening towards the rigid bar of the horizon. On the sandy beaches it fell, soft as silk, in ripples soundless as those of a river reach ; yet the hidden ledge, jutting like a straight lean spur from the heel of the headland and now hidden by the flowing tide, just made its presence felt. For, far out from the shore, where"], [132, "A PARSON AT BAY. 124 but a bare half-fathom of water covered it, would come now and then a long slow heave of the blue plane, passing over it with a milky swirl, and thus allowing the fanged reef to give a hint of its might \u2014 like some strong creature half-roused from sleep. Keylock had a kind of superstitious veneration for this ledge, which had more than once, thanks to a narrow channel at its shoreward end through which no revenue cruiser would venture, saved the smugglers from capture. \" I've dreamt more'n a few times of being driven on them rocks, with every plank o' my craft splitting and grinding,\" he muttered after a long pause, \" and maybe 'tis written that I shall end my days there.\" \" Psha ! \u2014 as a wicked old smuggler, you'll live to a hundred and ten, and then die peacefully in your bed, with the parson praying over you.\" \" Maybe, sir ; maybe not.\" \" By-the-by, Keylock, I'm forgetting what I came for \u2014 I want to speak to you about that dog of mine.

I don't mind a bit of duck-poaching, \u2014 so far your society has corrupted my innocence, \u2014 but when it comes to killing my dog by way of a bit of sport, by the Lord some one shall smart for it ! I suppose you know who did it, though of course you're not likely to give up his name ? \" Old Keylock had been expecting this question, yet it now set his heart beating like a hunted"], [133, "A PARSON AT BAY. 125 animal's. The crucial moment had come too suddenly: he felt that the answer he intended to give, the simple words, \"I did it,\" would be a veritable application of the touchstone. Aubrey, if guilty, would guess in a moment that Keylock had found him out, and killed the dog in the first outbreak of his wrath ; and, thus taken off his guard, the culprit's eyes must needs betray him. And then ? \"Then,\" mused the old man, as he drew his labouring breath ancl tried to slow down the rush of his thoughts, \"I'll hug him close in my arms, and we'll plunge over cliff together ! \" Aubrey, wishing to give the old man a moment or two for consideration, stepped to the extreme cliff-edge again, and stood looking down the sheer wall at his feet. \"Of all the classical rubbish,\" he murmured, \" which helped me into a profession that was bound to ruin a man with my tastes and younger son's portion to back them, I remember but one thing \u2014 perhaps because it is the only thing worth remem bering ; it's the reply of Sophocles to the question, ' Is life worth living ? ' \u2014 ' It were better never to have been born, ancl next best to depart as soon as possible.' \u2014 Well, Keylock, your silence answers my question. I don't expect you to give me the man's name ; but recommend him to keep clear of me \u2014 I'm dangerous. Hullo ! are you going ? \" Without turning his head, Aubrey heard the old man rise and move towards him. He had not the"], [134, "126 A PARSON AT BAY. smallest conception that his life hung upon a thread. Old Keylock stumbled forward, with sea and sky heaving and swaying before him. \" I, too, want a culprit's name.\" The words, he thought, had been actually spoken aloud, whereas his dry lips had only muttered them inaudibly. But, just as he found himself within arm's length of Aubrey, a loud clear voice called out : \" I say, you two, aren't you dangerously near the cliff edge ? \" It was the voice of Parson Brockenhart, who was out for his usual constitutional after a long spell of sermon-writing. Keylock, with every nerve and muscle unloosed by sudden reaction, sank back on to the grass, whispering to himself \u2014 \" 'Tis the hand o' the Almighty ; I might have mistook astonishment for guilt, and so have done it too soon. I'm to have a respite, I see.\" The vicar came rapidly along, whirling his stick and wondering what he should say to these men. He disliked passing any one, gentle or simple, with out the exchange of a few civil words; and, with those who didn't care for him, such exchange was a difficulty. Men like Keylock and Captain Aubrey, who regarded a parson in much the same light as a crow or a gull \u2014 as a creature, that is, not worth spending a cartridge upon \u2014 made him more than usually conscious of the heaviness of his small talk. With them it seemed that his slight defect of"], [135, "A PARSON AT BAY. 127 shyness was as an impassable chasm between man ancl man ; and, having none of the arrogance of the godly, he put all the blame upon himself, not perceiving that it was arrogance of another kind \u2014 that of the ungodly \u2014 which made his tongue so stiff on these occasions. The vicar was thinking hard as he approached the difficult pair; but could evolve no topic of conversation between a metaphysical question that he had just been turning over in his mind, and the weather. Of course he had to fall back upon the latter. \" Nice breezy day, isn't it ? \" he began, with a shy man's anxious cordiality. \" Yes,\" muttered Aubrey, sullenly, while he twirled his moustache and wished the parson at Jericho. (\" The man must be a soft -headed fool,\" he was thinking, \" to be as friendly, as they say he is, with that d \u2014 cl American ! \") \"How are you, Keylock? Done any fishing lately?\" \" Not much, sir.\" (\" Confound his remarks ! Why must he lug me into the talk ? \" thought the old man.) \" It seems that I have no conversation, but only a special gift for boring people,\" mused the humble parson, who, if encouraged at all, had in truth more to talk about than most people. \" Well, good morning ; I must be going home to lunch.\" With this simple formula Ulick Aubrey departed, after giving the vicar a surly nod."], [136, "128 A PARSON AT BAY. The old man, though he made as though he were as anxious to go as Captain Aubrey himself, was yet restrained by a lurking desire to have a few more words with Mr. Brockenhart. He was weakened by w hat he had been through ; and for the moment had a feeling, such as would have been perfectly natural in one of his feebler neighbours, but which to him came so strangely that he hardly knew what to make of it, that he would like to share his trouble with another, to listen, for once in a way, to the voice of human sympathy. The secret would be safe with the parson \u2014 perfectly safe ; there was balm in that assurance. He would be proud to receive such a confidence, eager to right Nan's wrong, lenient in his judgment of her. His pity would not be like that of the rest of the world, which Keylock dreaded so. Indeed, the vicar was just the man to rush to some kindly, but utterly improbable, conclusion as to a secret marriage, or what not. And Xan liked him ; he might succeed in persuading her to break silence, and so might open up some possible way of escape from the miserable complication. Keylock stood thinking thus, with his broad frame swaying slightly, ancl his bushy eyebrows working. As he reflected, the desire to speak increased upon him ; but, for all his strength, he had not power enough to conquer the ingrained habits of a life time. He could not get the words out. Nor could the vicar supply the one touch needful for the unloosing of the stubborn tongue. Much"], [137, "A PARSON AT BAY. 129 reading of books had not taught him to read men. He could not see what was passing beneath the hard tanned mask that was facing him. And the consciousness of his inability to get at men's hearts made him the more diffident and helpless. One of his most sanguine hopes had been that his little bride would charm his parish into liking him a little better, but a brief experience had dispelled that, with some other anticipations of the kind. He half suspected now, that Keylock had something to say, but felt that the old barrier was insurmountable as ever. And so, after a brief pause, the two men drew apart, and the words which would certainly have spurred the parson to action, and might possibly have materially altered future events, were left unsaid. 9"], [138, "A PARSON AT BAY. 130 CHAPTER X. \" And when we look for crowns to fall We find the tug's to come \u2014 that's all.\" Browning. f|f||HE following week was. for all the sulks at the m\u00c6\\ vicarage, an idyllic one in point of smooth ness and quiet beatitude ; an atmosphere sunny as that of a fairy tale settled down upon and enveloped them all. And the special charm about these calm intervals is their power to cheat the mind with impressions of permanence. Life has been a struggle, as one perceives the more clearly now that the racketing has settled down for a moment : but Hope will have it that the worst is over, and the present the true sample of life's yield ; while past troubles are but grain blighted by troubles that will come no more. It seldom occurs to a man \u2014 save, perhaps, when reviewing the affairs of a neighbour \u2014 that the cunning playwright, Circumstance, is well acquainted with the use of \" carpenter-scenes,\" in which a comic publican soliloquizes, or a pair of young lovers entertain the audience with their cooings in front of the stage, while the hidden back parts are being set for weighty events to come."], [139, "A PARSON AT BAY. 131 Parson Brockenhart, at any rate, gave himself up with all his old optimism to the full enjoyment of this deceitful calm. He felt, somehow, that he had turned a corner, and that nothing would go amiss any more. Nor could he have desired the flow of peace to come from a purer source than it did ; for it was in truth to Charmian, the only real piece of innocence, the only one of the family into whose mind the question of Aunt Mabel's income never entered, that the household owed its returning quietude and power of hopeful anticipation. Among all their selfish schemings, inevitable hypocrisies, and secret prejudices glossed over by self-interest, the child shone forth, as her father thought, like a fair white blossom from a tangle of ugly weeds. Meanwhile, Aunt Mabel's interest in the parson's little daughter, so far from diminishing, grew and strengthened with a swiftness that amazed even the fond parent. It seemed that the child had taken sm Men, but complete, possession of the heart which had so long been empty. It was a state of things far transcending their expectation, strange to look upon, and with something in it of sacred mystery. In truth, after a few days, Maisie secretly con sidered the campaign as ended ; she could almost hear Aunt Mabel saying, \" My dear, I can't think of allowing that little thing to be straitened in any way ; she must have change of air whenever necessary, and a proper education, etc., etc., and I shall from this date allow you so-and-so.\""], [140, "132 A PARSON AT BAY. The precise figure increased in direct ratio with Aunt Mabel's demonstrativeness. One morning, however, there chanced to be a heavy fall of the barometer ; the fairy, Charmian. came clown to breakfast in a mood. The family at once recognized that an infantile storm was brewing. The child, ordinarily sweet tempered, was subject to these gusts of passion occasionally ; and a highly strung nervous system helped to make them pretty severe. On this occasion she declined to look at Aunt Mabel, or to speak to any one, but sat in her chair with a pink-edged handkerchief held up to her tiny nose ; apparently ruminating upon the flatness and staleness of the world, the \" inhuman dearth of noble natures,\" or something else equally abstruse and depressing. \" Will you take me to see the nanny-goat to day ? \" asked the aunt, coaxingly. \" No.\" \" I think you will, Charmie ? \" \" No, no ! \" \" Then you'll come for a drive instead, little pet?\" \" No ! I won't go for a drive ; I won't see the nanny-go' ; I won't do anythin' at all ! \" Maisie felt despondent, but perfectly helpless. She could not say to Aunt Mabel, \" Leave her alone ; \" yet knew that to be the only possible way of averting the storm. But storm or no, Maisie need not have been"], [141, "A PARSON AT BAY. 133 discouraged. The new-born love had a power the deeper for its strangeness. Charmian could do nothing, short of changing her whole nature, to check it. Presently the family was treated to a little piece of comedy ; which seemed, however, to awe rather than amuse it. The impressive visitor, whose stern dignity, even now that they were used to her, had a certain paralyzing effect, at least upon the men, drew from her pocket a small doll that had been purchased in Bavant the day before, and, rising solemnly from her chair, proffered it to the naughty child. Charmian, saying not a word, clasped the doll to her heart with one hand, and with the other pressed the handkerchief more closely to her nose. The transaction, at first, seemed a doubtful success, yet the storm was averted. Aunt Mabel was shrewd enough not to press the attack further, for the present, and so it befell that in a few minutes Charmie fell ababbling like a merry brooklet. Now, the miraculous softening of Aunt Mabel naturally affected her relations with each and all of the family. It is easy, for instance, to keep a modest man out in the cold \u2014 to snap down the lid of his knowledge, howsoever well-stored be the casket, and turn the key with a word or two, and up to the evening of Sunday she had practised this simple art upon her host ; whereas now she rather encouraged him to make the best of himself, ad mitting by her manner that he was worth listening"], [142, "A PARSON AT BAY. 134 to. Thus Mr. Brockenhart found himself enjoying the unwonted excitement of book talk with a fairly well-read woman, who had moreover mixed a good deal with men of erudition ; and he was glad to think that his wife might perhaps be a little proud of the important visitor's growing respect for him. The church question was never once touched upon ; the talkers, in fact, keeping clear of the dangerous topic as though it were some private park guarded by spiked palings ancl set with spring-guns. To Phil, also, Aunt Mabel was now tolerably com placent ; his light gossip doubtless making a suitable relaxation after intellectual rallies with the parson. Maisie was, in truth, the only member of the group not completely satisfied. For, howsoever anxious she might be to further her aunt's curious idolatry, she resented her complete domination by any one but herself; and, though she had never suffered much from jealousy through the affections, she was now made to smart through the more open channel of her vanity. Maisie loved power with a fervour as yet unsuspected by those around her. She objected to long dreary discussions which gave her no opportunity of shining ; for what is the use of being smart and clever when the conversation (dings doggedly to some book \u2014 say Aristotle's \" Ethics \"\u2014which you don't happen to have read ? And yet, were the child's sweet babble to make itself heard through the door, the erudite aunt would quit in a moment any subject, to fall amaundering like any tiresome child-worshipping old grandam."], [143, "A PARSON AT BAY. 135 She would decline even to drive out visiting without Charmian ; she loaded the child with presents of all kinds ; had her photographed in Bavant in half a dozen attitudes ; heard her say her prayers at night ; could hardly be coaxed from the cot-side when the little head was laid upon the pillow. In short, Aunt Mabel's character seemed literally to have collapsed, like some stern cliff subsiding in a landslip. Under these circumstances Maisie became more discontented; began to hanker the more after the lost painting-joys, and to be more drawn towards another person, whose character was also in danger of serious subsidence \u2014 especially as, in this case, the disintegrating force was supplied by her own charms. Aunt Mabel herself, moreover, was well pleased that her niece's portrait should be painted by Mr. Otis, whose growing reputation in the critical world was known to her. Nor was there anything to excite public attention in these sittings, for the artist was also painting Lady Bavant, as well as certain other ladies of the neighbourhood. Miss Otis, too, who painted a little herself, was always in the studio ; and Phil was present, also, as often as he could find an excuse for accompanying his sister in-law ; while, in public, the artist was always prudently inattentive to the popular beauty. In this manner the time glided along smoothly and auspiciously ; ancl it was not until several weeks had passed, that Aunt Mabel signified her intention"], [144, "136 A PARSON AT BAY. of adjourning for a visit to the Grange. Her friend, Miss Crackanthorpe, it appeared, talked of going abroad later in the summer, and, in the mean time, wished to make the most of her ; but the visit was to be a short one, and she would be quite free to return to Marsh at its conclusion. The vicar received this announcement with one or two conventional murmurs, though for the moment it made little impression upon his mind. For he had not given himself to the campaign with Maisie's strenuous abandon ; and, even admit ting that it was politic to earn the good will of the wealthy relative, sordid scheming went against the grain with him, while his sanguine habit of mind had as yet stood in the way of a full realization of his position. During the last day or two, indeed, he had rather forgotten the really important feature of Aunt Mabel's visit ; regarding her rather as a pleasant intellectual adversary, and being further attracted by her lavish affection for little Charmian. Upon Phil's ears, however, the news fell sweetly as the first breathings of springtide. The strain brought upon him, through his loyal endeavours to further the family interests by keeping in the good graces of a lady whom he secretly detested, was severe. He liked gentle human-hearted women (like Miss Otis, for example), and found this aunt of Maisie's but a stony creature. True, she had one soft place ; but where was the credit of falling in love with Charmie ? Every one did that ; the child had some bewitching quality too subtle for"], [145, "A PARSON AT BAY. 137 explanation. She was the pet of the village ; even Old Keylock would unbend to her ; and the riotous youngsters of the Quay would bring her presents of birds' eggs and rare seaweeds. No \u2014 Phil was not going to strike his colours to Aunt Mabel for the sake of her one amiable weakness ; and, moreover, was acute enough to perceive that even in this she was profoundly selfish \u2014 always trying to get Char mian to herself, to win her from others by constant presents and cajolements. To Maisie alone the news was no news. Aunt Mabel had discussed the question with her last night ; and the invitation was the fruit of her own diplomacy. Unable to quite grasp the breadth and depth of the new craze, she had, in fact, been hedging against the possibility of her aunt's getting bored at the vicarage. A visit to the Grange, while keeping her in the neighbourhood, would certainly lessen this danger ; and, as Maisie fully intended to let Aunt Mabel take the child with her, the craze would have further chances of develop ment. After a time the visitor might be expected to return a veritable slave, and all High Church alarms could then be put aside. Miss Crackanthorpe was manipulated without much difficulty. One had to be honest with her ; but Maisie, being quite aware of this, was honesty itself. \" Dear Miss Crackanthorpe,\" she said appealingly, \" you know how we are placed, and how important it is for us to keep my aunt amused. I do hope"], [146, "A PARSON AT BAY. 138 you will give us a helping hand, and so neutralize in some measure the possible effects of my husband's unfortunate views.\" \" Oh, your husband's dreadful, my dear, dreadful ! \" exclaimed the candid old maid. \" I sometimes fear that he's going straight to perdition. We may hear of his introduction of vestments and incense almost any day ; and I know well that Lord Bavant is growing fidgety about him. There's a very strong feeling in the town against your husband, as we all know ; and it is tempting Providence for a poor parson to so outrage public opinion. And pray, what good comes of it ? Does his High Churchmanship put any check upon those poaching rogues at the Quay ? Do they ever come to church ? \" No, indeed,\" murmured Maisie, who privately conceived that rankest Popery or blankest Evange licalism would fall with equal flatness upon the Keylock-Culmer mind \u2014 as upon her own. \" Well, my dear, suppose we ask your aunt over here for a week or two ? \" \" That would be most kind of you ; yet she is so wrapped up in little Charmian that I almost fear \" \" Tut, tut, then we must have the child over too. I almost fear that your aunt's a silly old woman. I don't like her half as well as I used ; she has grown too learned \u2014 in other words, priggish.

However, send your aunt over ; I'll try to put up with her for a couple of weeks, if you promise to fetch her home at the end of them.\" So it was settled ; and, furthermore, Maisie had already another plan hovering about her by no means dull brain, the accomplishment of which would, however, depend upon the course of events \u2014 and perhaps upon the state of her conscience. The unconscious vicar of Marsh-under-Cliff was, in fact, surrounded just now by a maze of little plots and conspiracies ; he was marching in the careless sanguine fashion of one who sees his horizon clearing, among the very scouts and spies of a powerful hidden enemy. Nor was there any seeing friend at hand to give him warning of the struggle to come. For the present, as it happened, there was nothing worse to be considered than a brief parting with his little daughter ; yet he found this small trial sharper than he would have thought possible. She went off in Miss Crackanthorpe's victoria, seated on Aunt Mabel's knee, radiantly happy, eagerly waving farewells to him. He tried to be glad that the soreness of parting was all on his side ; but prickings there were, of some kind, which spoiled the flavour of his morning's work, and sent him off along the cliff-path an hour before his usual time. Maisie was quite good-hearted enough to feel for him, and took genuine pains to brighten the midday meal. In the afternoon he plunged into the parish"], [148, "140 A PARSON AT BAY. as usual, visiting many cottages and farms where he was but half welcome, and from which he was apt to emerge with a depressing sense of failure. But he stuck to his duty the more doggedly to-day because of the blank time to follow \u2014 the evening hour, that is, which preceded the child's retirement for the night, when she was wont to pervade the house with her prattle, leading her daddy about by the hand, and forcing him to invent story after story with breathless haste. As he drew near home, his desire for the child grew acute enough to astonish even himself. He felt the absurdity of being so downcast : but the connection between him and Charmian was peculiar ; he had long been father and mother to the child, and the performance of the double function had perhaps given a double edge to parental fondness. In a day or two, however, he would doubtless regain his normal sanity. Yet sanity, when correlated with great tenderness, is often unstable as water. Will cannot hold it fast, nor can Reason stop the leaks through which it oozes away ; and Parson Brockenhart was presently forced to admit that he would not be quite himself until the little thing came back to him. A few days later Maisie happened to be dining at the Grange, and her return home that night was the signal for the first real skirmish of a campaign which she had looked upon as all but concluded. The parson was reading in his study, in the full glory of bachelor freedom and discomfort. He was seated on one hard chair, with his legs on another ;"], [149, "A PARSON AT BAY. 141 all around him were scattered open books of reference ; before him were manuscript sheets of a heavy work upon Agnosticism which had been engaging him for some years. His sight being good, and his zeal for economy most fervent, he had but one candle. His costume consisted of an old boating-coat and a pair of patched trousers, while the general dishevelment of the room was complete enough to shake the nerves of any right-minded woman. To him, about the hour of midnight, entered Maisie in black and gold, with her lovely arms and shoulders gleaming whitely forth from folds of caressing black lace. Every one had admired the dress, save only her hostess, who whispered, with her usual frankness, \" You'll ruin that husband of yours, my dear, even before he goes over to Rome \u2014 an event which may happen any day.\" But Maisie was not thinking of her gown at this moment. She was oppressed by disappointment, and a heavy sense of complications to come ; ancl, to do her full justice, she felt very pitifully towards the husband upon whom her tidings must needs fall heavily. The most liberal endowment of selfish ness will yet leave room, in a woman who is not dull brained as well as self-centered, for a good deal of human feeling, and Maisie, who had been galled throughout the drive by personal vexation, now felt a thrill of sympathy for the toiling occupant of the little study. \" You do work hard, Claud,\" she murmured,"], [150, "142 A PARSON AT BAY. glancing down at the heap of closely written pages. \" I wish you would take life more easily.\" \" Don't distress yourself, little woman,\" said Claud, eagerly, \" for this beloved labour of mine is of the kind that ' physics pain.'

Her husband, for all his humility, had a deep underlying pride which she had now roused effectually ; and she was now to see how quickly his mettle could answer to the spur of necessity. The parson seized pen and paper, and without pause or apparent reflection, wrote off several letters in rapid succession.

Yet, simple unspoiled flower as he thought her,"], [160, "152 A PARSON AT BAY. Miss Otis was capable of taking hearty dislikes at short notice, and her present tone of voice suggested that she had already been practising this gift upon Mr. Parr-Nugent himself. In truth, taking into consideration the wealth and advantages with which Dame Fortune had cushioned her life, and which should surely have issued in a charming girlish optimism, she was a thought too much given to violent prejudices at this period. Had the mother, who had been sum moned away so hastily just as Dorothy was budding into womanhood, been able to look into the daughter's mind just now, it might have been a disappointing experience for her. Mrs. Otis, like many over-anxious mothers, had always been a theorist ; and it was one of her firmest convictions that the lessons of the world should be learned in driblets ; that the impact of a mass of worldly experience poured suddenly upon young people on first emerging from youthhood, must needs shatter the half-formed character. Accord ingly, she had kept the brother and sister secluded as long as possible, proposing to further extend their novitiate until they should be old enough and strong enough to bear safely through the world their burden of dangerous wealth. But Hereward's craving for an art -life had, in his case, upset these plans ; and he had passed, not from school and college, but straight from the still seclusion of home tuition, into a world whose air proved too strong for him. He came back to her with all his"], [161, "A PARSON AT BAY. 153 home ideals replaced by a deep blank pessimism that fell upon the mother's heart like a blight. Thereafter she had concentrated herself the more closely upon her daughter Dorothy, educating her partly in the States, partly in France, and planning for her a slow emergence to be spread over many years. But death cut short this scheme, and, after a brief interregnum of hired duennas, Dorothy had come forth as suddenly as her brother, to find her self the cynosure of a popular English neigh bourhood. Her young beliefs had not collapsed suddenly, like Hereward's, but there was already going for ward a slow disintegrating process which she herself noted with misgiving. She could still resist strenu ously her brother's views as to the dead level of human depravity, yet was beginning to find the world a meaner place than she had expected. The many aspirants to her hand and fortune, especially as the greediest were naturally first and foremost in the attack, had helped to disillusion her; and she would lie awake of a night at times, reflecting bitterly that, so far from restoring to Harry the old happy ideals, as had been her girlish aspiration, she was more likely to sink by degrees into his own Slough of Despond. Thus harassed by indelicate loveless wooings, Dorothy was the readier to rise in arms against Mr. Parr-Nugent, the very latest soupirant ; and having now borne the brunt of his talk for a whole weary hour, she looked appealingly towards her brother,"], [162, "154 A PARSON AT BAY. who was working in moody silence in another corner of the studio. But Harry had himself taken a dislike to his visitor, and, being in a more sensitive and irritable mood than usual, was by no means to be draped into the conversation. In old Paris days, when Parr-Nugent was a poor devil in search of employment, Otis had befriended and rather liked him ; but later success had developed in the man a crude egotism which had a ravaging effect upon the nerves of the fastidious artist. \"Now look at me,\" continued the unconscious offender after a brief pause ; \" I'm a barrister by profession, the law is the ladder by which I shall eventually mount into Parliament : but do you suppose I can hope to make the ascent without self-advertisement? I say that notoriety is the very spinal marrow of success, as things go now. ' Know thyself,' says the Greek aphorism ; ' Be known,' I say ! I'm known myself as a sportsman, diner-out, art-critic, playwright, occasional jour nalist. I have even, in deference to the popular craze, taken to golf (which I like about as well as dominoes), and my ' putting ' has already brought me some kudos, as well as a host of new acquaint ances. I never throw away a chance : I have an eye on every one, a finger in every pie.\" \" Your energy is admirable, I am sure, but why not simplify your labours,\" Miss Otis suggested rather viciously, \" by inventing a new hair-dye, and so achieve fame at a stroke ? \" \" By invention, did you say ? \" the visitor snatched"], [163, "A PARSON AT BAY. 155 at the one word without heeding the rest of the sentence. \" I'm not an inventor, you see.

And I'm never idle, you know ; even down here, where I seem to be merely enjoying myself, I'm collecting materials for an article on ' Clerical Cramming,' a subject that occurred to me in the train the other day. There's Mr. Tomlinson, for instance, that Rector of Alderlands, whom several of your friends have spoken of \u2014 I have half a dozen notes of his case already. I shall make it hot for Tomlinson before I've done with him : our paper, the Butcher-Bird, has a sharp beak, let me tell you. \"The Butcher -Bird?

He makes a nice little fortune as a crammer, ancl is content to let his parish go to the dogs. He set himself deliberately to brave public opinion, and now that he has made money the neighbourhood begins to respect him.

The child would be brought up and educated without costing him a penny, and the living wage secured. Better throw up your brief, Miss Ottis; you've given away your case.\" \" Perhaps so\u2014 from the point of view of the Butcher-Bird. However, I still have hopes of softening the aunt. I have asked her to pay us a visit, and, as she professes to like me, something may yet be done.\""], [167, "A PARSON AT BAY. 159 \" Lady Wroughton coming here ? \" cried the artist, sharply. \" That's news to me, Dorothy.\" \"Ah,\" murmured the sister with a rueful little sigh, \"I only committed myself to the fatal invitation last night. It was a reckless act, for I'm terribly afraid of her. When her learned talk begins, I yearn for my native backwoods ; and am so acutely conscious of my ignorance that I dare not speak of so much as the weather \u2014 for even on that topic one may blunder egregiously. Last night, for instance, I said something as to the coming change of the moon promising well for us, and she proceeded at once to solemnly explain that the moon has nothing to do with the weather. Half an hour's meteorology followed, and I was too much crushed, almost, to get the invitation spoken. Yet it had to be done, for I had previously been talking it over with Maisie ; and I know that the Brockenharts are anxious to keep the difficult aunt in the neighbourhood, and that Miss Crackan thorpe is already tired of her guest. However, I must apologize to our friends for talking over their private affairs thus ; that is your fault, you know, Mr. Parr-Nugent, for of course I'm anxious to convert you to my point of view.\" Now, though Parr-Nugent showed no symptoms whatever of being thus converted, it happened that Dorothy had made a considerable, though uncon scious, impression in another quarter. Her warm, but futile defence of Mr. Brockenhart had the effect of leading off the current of her brother's thoughts"], [168, "160 A PARSON AT BAY. in a direction little to his liking, for his mind was nowadays too frequently harping upon this vicar of Marsh-under-Cliff. In truth, the artist had drifted latterly into a set of conditions well calculated to harass him to the utmost. He was, as Maisie had rightly conceived, a widely different person from that image of himself which he chose to offer for the inspection of his neighbours ; though neither Maisie, nor even his sister, knew him for what he really was \u2014 a wonder ing, deeply reflective man, for ever probing the world of mankind, in a puzzled hopeless fashion, for something he could not find. But for the sudden ness of his plunge from a home atmosphere into the whirl of the outer world, he might have learned to look steadily, as others do, upon that confusing amalgam of good and evil ; as it was, the first coup d'\u0153il of the struggle for existence had taken his breath away, and upset the poise of his mind. He had acquired a morbid knack of finding corruption everywhere. In the student-life of Paris he could see nothing but squalid striving, cynical self interest, sensual animalism. His wealth helped to put him out of touch with the stragglers ; he had never felt the beneficent pressure which makes for brotherhood among all those who have to work for their bread. Hence, perhaps, his first inclination to essay the more leisured life of au English country gentleman. But here, again, he had been disappointed ; the interested pursuit of himself and his sister, so far from rejuvenating him, had given"], [169, "A PARSON AT BAY. 161 a new edge to his pessimism ; he was still looking for the divine something in human nature which had come to be his secret life-quest. Nevertheless, but for his folly in establishing his home within such easy reach of Maisie's, Otis might justly have continued to sum himself up as \" per- plext in faith, but pure in deeds.\" But for her, it seemed, he might have maintained the high stoical standard that he had originally set up for himself, and have solved the problem of how to maintain a system of morality that was none the less strict for being founded only upon reason and a fastidious taste. The system had held good under ordinary circumstances ; but had at length, he was fain to confess, broken under his weight like a rotten crutch. Yet, it so happened that, though the pursuit of Maisie had injured him not a little in his own sight, it had also brought him under a new influence which promised to have quite another issue \u2014 the unconscious influence of the simple parson, whose unsuspecting friendship was a kind of homily in itself. Indeed, Otis might have likened himself to one who has gone astray from a planned route, to find himself on quaking ground, yet with fine; views threatening to reveal themselves, if his eyes could but clear the surrounding mists. For, after passing through a first natural hostility to the man who had forestalled him, Otis had pro ceeded to weigh and analyze this parson coolly, as he did every other human puppet with whom he came in contact. The increasing intimacy between 11"], [170, "A PARSON AT BAY. 162 the families had afterwards given him especial facilities for studying Claud Brockenhart ; and the man so weighed had not been found wanting. Otis seemed to have found for once in a way some one who, when tested, would show some, at least, of the fine metal which he sought. He was personally drawn to the man, too; and good points reveal themselves more readily to a critic so kindled. But, however this might be, it was certain that the humble parson, whose virtues fell rather flatly upon most people, was unconsciously winning a special ancl peculiar appreciation from the very person whom a shrewd observer would have pronounced his most dangerous enemy. Now, this growing liking for Maisie's husband was hardly calculated to act as a salve to the artist's conscience. The irony of the situation did, in fact. press heavily upon him at times ; and though he had until lately been supported by Maisie's seeming invulnerability, some symptoms of weakness on her part were now beginning to discover themselves. At any rate, Dorothy's announcement of Lady Wroughton's coming visit, which must certainly tend to increase the intimacy between the two families, rather scared than pleased him ; and fright is apt to drive out sophistry. His sister had suc ceeded in thoroughly disturbing his peace of mind for the time being. Meanwhile, Dorothy made no further effort to soften Parr-Nugent, but rather encouraged him to talk about himself\u2014 a topic which always called"], [171, "A PARSON AT BAY. 163 forth his best eloquence, while exacting from a listener nothing more than occasional, easily feigned attention. After some little indulgence of his ego, however, he brought the conversation neatly round to the river scenery, and suggested an hour's boating before lunch. \"You couldn't do better,\" said the artist, emerging at length from his silence. \"You'll find the cushions in the boat, and everything ready.\" \"Then let me persuade you to join me, Miss Otis ; a little fresh air will do you good after so much toil at the easel ? \" \"Thank you; but I must really finish these flowers before they fade : and there's the Grange tennis-party this afternoon, you know.\" \" You won't come ! that's hard on me ! \" \" I must really stick to my work, thanks. After one or two more persuasive efforts he began to depart, though a little sulkily. Trillings of many larks came floating in at the studio door as he opened it. \" Can you resist them ? \" he pleaded once more. \" What is it the poetess says \u2014 ' ' Millions of larks at their matins hang over, Thanking the Lord for a life so sweet.' Pretty rhythmic lines, eh? though the theistic touch is woefully out of date.\" \"By-the-by, you'll find Lady Bavant on the water with two of her nieces. They'll be delighted"], [172, "A PARSON AT BAY. 164 to have a chat with you. Don't let us keep you in this close room any longer.\" As the door closed, Otis threw down his brashes with a heart-easing sigh, exclaiming \u2014 \"How excellent and subtle a thing is woman's wit, to which even a bore must succumb ! \" \" It is indeed a relief to be rid of him. We're safe for an hour, at least.\" \" The gods be thanked ! \" \"Oh, Harry, I do wish you were not such a pagan,\" she cried fretfully, moving about the room as though unable to settle to anything. \" So do I, dear,\" he muttered, like one thinking aloud. Dorothy stopped dead in the midst of her peram bulation. This small admission of her brother's was the first of the kind she had ever heard him make ; and, coming from him, it amounted almost to a revelation of that inner self into which he allowed none to pry. She did not venture upon another word, lest her half-hope should be crushed by his next rejoinder. The artist continued to stand before his easel, silently ruminating, seemingly unregardful of her presence. His sister listened, with a quickening pulse, for his next words. \" Have you quite committed yourself to asking Lady Wroughton here ? \" Seeing no connection between this question and his previous statement, she was disappointed, and answered carelessly \u2014"], [173, "A PARSON AT BAY. 165 \" Yes, I have. But she will be my charge, Harry ; her visit need not affect you in any way.\" \" Well, I'm sorry she's coming, though it can't he helped now.\" \" I don't think you half understand what is going on at Marsh vicarage, Harry. I must see this aunt of Maisie's, and try to work upon her feelings. I will not have that poor man robbed of his child. I tell you, they are all plotting against him. Maisie thinks it will be for his good to give up the little thing ; her aunt has a kind of crazed affection for Charmian, and she is straining every nerve to get possession of her. Miss Crackanthorpe is quietly joining in the scheme. They want to break the man's heart \u2014 for his good \u2014 don't you see ? They pretend to have dropped the scheme ; they will get him over to the Grange, and soft-sawder him, and lull him into fancied security. And now he has struck a blow at them, without knowing it, by securing these pupils ; if he can earn a living by his exertions they will no longer have power to hurt him. I know exactly how they stand, because \u2014 his brother so often talks to me of Mr. Brocken hart. Isn't it pitiful to think how the money question can so dominate a man's life and happiness ? And to think that I should have all these thousands that I don't want, while a friend is struggling for the bare privilege of keeping his only child ! And I know you think well of him, Harry ? \" \" I should call him, to borrow from Cervantes, ' an honest man, if such an epithet may be applied"], [174, "A PARSON AT BAY. 166 to one that is poor.' That's a modest eulogy ; yet, as far as my experience goes, one couldn't apply it to more than one in a million. I certainly couldn't lay claim to it myself, for instance \u2014 though I'm not poor.\""], [175, "A PARSON AT BAY. 167 CHAPTER XII. \" To take advice of friends is ever honourable ; for lookers on see many times more than gamesters, and the vale best discovereth the hill.\" \u2014 Bacon. (TUP AKLY in the afternoon, Otis drove his sister iLsal and Parr-Nugent over to the tennis-party at the Grange. This proved to be a small gathering ; and Miss Crackanthorpe, according to her wont, left her guests pretty much to themselves. \" To try to entertain people,\" she would often remark, \"is the part of a fool \u2014 at least in this country. I never make any such attempt. Give them their game \u2014 tennis or what-not \u2014 and let them bore themselves in their own way. Perfect liberty of boredom, that is my principle. The Englishman is naturally a dull fellow, ancl the spur only makes him sulky. Leave the girls to hammer something out of him if they can \u2014 the exercise is their only pastime, and often does them good \u2014 and dose him with iced cup when he grows restive. Meanwhile, gather the elders about you, and throw down the first apple of discord that comes to hand ; for we're always happy when wrangling.\" During most of this afternoon, Miss Crackanthorpe"], [176, "168 A PARSON AT BAY. was seated under the verandah at the end of the big drawing-room, dispensing the frank remarks for which she was noted to all goers and comers ; the latter being usually indulged with caustic criticism of the former. Near her sat the countess, smiling alike upon charity and uncharity, upon genial trifle and cutting comment ; and good-naturedly shelter ing timid young people who had not spirit enough to bandy words with their hostess. \" You are idle to-day,\" said Miss Crackanthorpe, addressing Mr. Otis, who was standing beside her; \" you've been lounging about my chair here for the last hour.\" \" I am quite unable to \" Tear yourself away ? Don't talk nonsense. You ought to be with the young people.\" \" But you pride yourself upon allowing full liberty to us all, I believe ? \" \" Ah, you are the only person of my acquaintance who dares to retort upon me ; and that's why you're a favourite of mine, I suppose. But your motive in staying here ? No man bores himself deliberately without a motive.\" \" I am not boring myself ; but I confess to a motive.\" Otis looked expressively at Lady Bavant, who happened to be standing up, and for the moment to be out of earshot. \" On guard over Lady Bavant ; and why ? Come, have some mercy on an inquisitive old woman.\" \" I want to keep my friend Parr-Nugent clear of her ladyship.\""], [177, "A PARSON AT BAY. 169 \"Pray keep him clear of me also. How could you inflict that detestable young man upon me to day ? The very first time I met that up-to-date friend of yours, he poured himself out upon me for the best part of an hour, plunged me into a morass of confidences, spread out his hopes before me as a shopman his wares, could scarcely be hindered from forcing upon me every detail of his income, and ended by cross-examining me as to Mr. Brockenhart and certain parish affairs which \" \" Ah ! \" cried Otis, with a savage dig at the gravel with his heel. \"But don't imagine that I let out any secrets. Whatever be my failings, I'm staunch to my own set. The Brockenharts are of our set, and I'll have no prying into their affairs by strangers.

Think how she would feel for Mr. Parr- Nugent, the rising young barrister, so anxious and pushing, so athirst for reputation ! I guarantee that, if he secured ten minutes with Lady Bavant, his article on ' Clerical Cramming,' which he told me all about, is practically completed, and Mr. Brockenhart libelled with all the vigour of an up-to-date journalist. It is less dangerous to have a hard old woman like me for an enemy, than a good-natured weakling like the countess for a friend, as our High Church vicar will presently discover.\" Otis perceived the truth of this, and his vexation was the more acute by reason of his further knowledge. He was aware that his sister's defence of the parson might be even more dangerous to him than Lady Bavant's admissions; for Parr-Nugent was apparently on the verge of making an offer to Dorothy \u2014 might commit himself this very afternoon even \u2014 and would inevitably get severely snubbed for his pains. After wliich he would be returning to town, sore and spiteful, and with a neat little turn of revenge ready to his hand. He might seriously injure Claud Brockenhart ; and every one would know that the man who had struck the parson was the friend and guest of Hereward Otis. It was clearly advisable to see and warn Dorothy as soon as she could be disentangled from the tennis. As she was safely engaged for the present, however, he might probe Miss Crackanthorpe a little further. \" I suppose you have heard of Lady Wroughton's"], [179, "A PARSON AT BAY. 171 offer to adopt your vicar's little girl?\" he remarked. \" Oh dear, yes ; I'm a party to the plot in a way.\" \" Would you like the plot as well, may I ask, if his views were Evangelical ? \" This was a bad stroke, and quite unlike Otis in its crudity ; but his normal tact was in abeyance just now. The little old lady at once drew herself up, kindling and bridling. \" You do me gross injustice, Mr. Otis. It is quite true that I detest his churchmanship ; but, for all that, I'm far from being his personal enemy. He's not a shirker, like that wretch Mr. Tomlinson ; and never could be. But he can't live without pupils, and perhaps not with them ; and, moreover, he might lose them any day, and then what's to become of that delicate child ? What possible provision can he make for her, pray ? The man's not immortal : he'll die like other people, I suppose ? But of course, like the rest of you, he's lost in selfishness, and never gives a thought to the child's future ? \" \" To call a man ' selfish ' for clinging to his only child seems to me rather a misuse of terms ; and some people might apply a much stronger word to those who wish to rob him of his little treasure.\" \" I never had occasion to think you a hypocrite before ! \" was the sharp retort. \"If that is your impression of me, I have only"], [180, "A PARSON AT BAY. 172 to thank you for your former friendship, and to beg \" \" Wait a minute ! First hear me out ; then you shall be free to cut my acquaintance if you choose. I don't think you a hypocrite now, though, with a slighter knowledge of you, I might be tempted to do so. What is your position at this moment? You make an appeal to me in the interests of Mr. Brockenhart, you preach to me on the cruelty of my conduct, and all the time you are yourself the only real enemy to his happiness ! \" \" What do you mean ? \" \" Pray lower your voice, as I do mine. I don't want every one to hear what we are quarrelling about. You know perfectly well what I mean. The man has a wife as well as a child.\" Otis winced before he could control his muscles. \" Ah, you understand me. I see. You thought yourself clever enough to deceive me as well as other people, didn't you? You are shrewd and subtle, Mr. Otis, but not shrewd enough to hoodwink me. Now let me make a counter-appeal to you in this same parson's interest. You mean no harm, of course ; other people admire this fascinating little minx, and why shouldn't you ? That's how you put it, isn't it ? I pass over all that, nor will I waste time in preaching to a man of the world ; but this much I will say \u2014 ' Here is a vain, but captivating girl ; discontented with her lot, caring very little for her husband ; but not radically bad, \u2014 a girl with a certain quantum of fairly good stuff in her, who, if"], [181, "A PARSON AT BAY. 173 left alone, may do no great harm to any one. That's the verdict of one who has no great liking for her, mind. Now, it is open to you to flatter her vanity a little more, to go on painting pictures of her, and increasing the sentimental admiration that she already has for you, until some kind friend takes it into his or her head to warn the husband \u2014 our struggling parson. How much will that help him in his difficulties ? He's a hot man ; she's neither tame nor timid. There'll be anger and recrimination ; their home will be full of evil spirits of a hue darker than poverty's. There \u2014 my homily's ended ; and if I hadn't thought well of you, I shouldn't have troubled to deliver it. You are now free to set me down as an interfering old woman, and go off in a huff \u2014 or to show the magnanimity that one looks for from the better sort of men. Will you have another cup of tea, while you are making up your mind whether to cut me or not ? \" \" Mr. Brockenhart, madam ! \" announced a ser vant at this moment, ushering the parson himself through the open French window behind the speaker. Claud Brockenhart looked well and happy, indeed almost radiant. It takes but a small threat of kindness on Fortune's part to hearten the sanguine ; and, to the hopeful mind, two pupils in hand suggest a dozen more in the bush. The vicar's gloom had already vanished, and with it much of his resentment against Aunt Mabel. She meant well, and doubtless"], [182, "A PARSON AT BAY. 174 his indignation had been disproportioned to the case ; moreover, since the rejection of her offer, she had behaved far more graciously than could have been expected, taking pains, even, to assure Mr. Brocken hart that she bore no malice against him. At any rate he was so far repentant as to bring Charmian with him, and so to give to his visit this afternoon the colour of a peace-offering. Charmian was ravished at the prospect of coming to the Grange and seeing Aunt Mabel again ; but, on catching sight of the groups on the lawn, collapsed into sudden shyness. She clung tightly to her father's hand as they stepped out on to the gravel, and flatly declined to recognize her hostess. The sharp little woman, it is true, had a natural dislike of children and a power of suppressing them by a look. To her, every child was a creature designed by Providence for the smashing of one's china and the spoiling of one's temper. \" Well, won't you speak to me, child ? \" she cried. frowning severely ; then added, under her breath, \" I wonder how he can make so much fuss about the sullen little thing ! \" But the sullen child was admittedly worth looking at. She was dressed in a fascinating little smock of blue and silver, designed and purchased by her Aunt Mabel, and fashioned on the artistic side of the Channel. \" Oh, the little pet ! \" purred Lady Bavant. \" Will you come and sit on my knee, dear ? \""], [183, "A PARSON AT BAY. 175 Charmian held back for a moment, then advanced timidly. \" Ah, that's right, little Gold-hair \u2014 you haven't forgotten me, have you ? Dear me, what a little fairy thing it is, Mr. Brockenhart ! \" \"I detest this child- worship ! \" muttered Miss Crackanthorpe. But several other ladies were gravitating to wards the blue and silver figure, and she had to put up with a good deal more folly of the same kind. Lady Wroughton moved about the outskirts of the group, hungering after the child, but not daring to make any demonstration. Maisie had drilled her carefully, preaching caution insistently. Presently Miss Otis perceived the new arrival, and came swimming over the grass, racquet in hand. \" What ! is that my little Charmie ? \" she cried. \" Let no one venture to cut me out of my private property. Charmie, you're my little sweetheart, aren't you ? You like Dor'thy better than all the others put together, don't you ? \" \" Yes \u2014 perhaps,\" answered the child, slyly. \" Then come and race over the courts with me, you little deserter ! \" In a moment the little blue figure was scampering over the grass in hot chase of her admirer, with Aunt Mabel's hungry eyes following her hither and thither. Meanwhile, among those who held aloof from the"], [184, "176 A PARSON AT BAY. gathering in the verandah, was a group of three ; consisting of one of those plain good-natured women whom their neighbours find so useful as lay figures, and of two sick-hearted persons for whom she was patiently making conversation \u2014 to wit, Mr. Parr- Nugent and Mrs. Brockenhart. The former of these had, within the hour, been wounded in rather a vital part \u2014 his vanity. Parr- Nugent had offered his hand, and his excellent prospects, to the American heiress, and had been rejected with a contempt that stung none the less for its quietness. The neatness and delicacy of his declaration, too, made this treatment seem grossly unfeeling. He could not, of course, pretend to be overmastered by passion after so brief an acquaint ance, but his speech had been really artistic, perfect in expression as a well-turned paragraph. There was no vestige of excuse for her harshness. To relieve his smart Parr-Nugent had naturally turned to the prettiest woman available, parading her before Miss Otis, and talking brilliantly to demonstrate his unconcern. Yet Mrs. Brockenhart happened to be in a mood unsuitable for the reflection of this brilliancy, which obliged the humble lay figure to catch most of the sparks as best she might. In fact, of the two sick-hearted ones, Maisie was by far the deeper sufferer. Up till lately her task had been to ward off ancl restrain the admiration of a certain too-appreciative artist ; but on one or two occasions lately there had been symptoms of cooling"], [185, "A PARSON AT BAY. 177 on his part. This afternoon the coolness was more pronounced ; and, worse still, she seemed to lack the spirit necessary for meeting these altered con ditions. She felt deserted, almost love-lorn; and the feeling brought shame with it, as well as de pression. He had always, save just at first, been careful not to compromise her with the gossips ; but hitherto a glance or two in the course of a long afternoon had always sufficed to keep her heart alive. To-day, although no watchful Aubrey had been at hand to stimulate caution, he had not once looked at her. Maisie yearned to make him jealous ; to stir his pity ; to pose before him like a heroine, as on the occasion of their first meeting at the Castle ; to do something, or anything, to win a concerned glance from him. There were no men here worth men tioning this afternoon, however ; but just one or two youths from Oxford or Sandhurst, with Mr. Parr- Nugent, who, until the last half-hour, had been otherwise engaged, and the reason for whose present demonstrativeness Maisie could easily fathom. Even Claud, with his shyness lessened by ridiculous elation about the two pupils, was more conspicuous than she this afternoon ; he was listening eagerly to the praises of Charmian, and making quite an im pression \u2014 for him. In fact, Maisie felt for once in a way thoroughly ineffective ; and it was presently her fate to see the artist depart without having bestowed upon her the one look for which she craved. 12"], [186, "178 A PARSON AT BAY. Shortly before they left, Otis found an oppor tunity of whispering to his sister \u2014 \" Do be careful not to offend Nugent ; reject him as civilly as you can.\" \" Oh, that little incident is closed,\" she answered coolly enough. \" I've half forgotten it already.\""], [187, "A PARSON AT BAY. 179 CHAPTER XIII. \" There is another kind of fortune, called ill luck ; so ill, that you hope it will die,\u2014 but it don't.\" \u2014 Hood. ||||]]HE immediate results of what Dorothy was l_a__a| pleased to call the \" little incident \" of Mr. Parr-Nugent's rejection, were the clearing of the Castle's atmosphere and the restoration of its mistress's good temper ; for the unsuccessful suitor was summoned up to town next morning. Mr. Parr-Nugent departed in peace \u2014 even in good spirits, as it seemed, \u2014 leaving Dorothy to go carolling about the grounds and studio all the morning. His bland civility continued up to the last, and, plainly suggesting a good-natured accept ance of his fate, gave her a touch of compunction ; but delight at the removal of the incubus quickly swamped all symptoms of repentance. She managed to be kinder to him at breakfast than she had yet been ; and this complacence, she considered, was a set-off against any little pain she might have caused him. \" If that formidable aunt of Maisie's were not coming to-morrow, Harry,\" she cried, breaking in"], [188, "A PARSON AT BAY. 180 upon her brother, as he stood at work, \" I should be like a mad thing ; and even that anticipation but half sobers me. I want you now to give out that I will entertain no more proposals for at least a month, for why shouldn't I have the humble privilege of an overcrowded editor? These de mands upon one's purse are embittering ; and I begin to conceive of your noble sex as a set of highwaymen, who spring up at every turn in my path, crying, pistol in hand, \" Your money, miss, your money ! Throw in your heart if you please, but anyway hand over the dollars before I blow your brains out ! \" But the pleasantry fell flat upon Hereward, who was in no mood for fooling of any kind. His relation with the Brockenharts, which had caused him so much mental harassment lately, was threat ening to become more thorny and complicated. He distrusted Parr-Nugent 's seeming good nature, and had a strong suspicion that it would soon have an unpleasant issue ; and, supposing that he over rated the man's power to injure, even an abortive attack upon Parson Brockenhart would add con siderably to his present disquiet. And then, there was Parson Brockenhart 's wife. Maisie's evident distress )resterday had cut Otis sharply. He had already, it appeared, brought trouble upon her : and now Dorothy would be asking her over every day to meet her aunt, thus pushing things on from bad to worse. He might preserve, by force of will, his attitude of coldness"], [189, "A PARSON AT BAY. 181 towards her ; but could he trust himself to do this for any length of time ? He felt that, with Miss Crackanthorpe's frank warning, and Maisie's demon stration of weakness, the situation had entered upon a more acute stage \u2014 a stage expressly fitted to break down a defence that had already been severely shaken. Circumstances had proved him to be poorly equipped for a contest with temptation ; yet, on the other hand, the very staple of his nature unfitted him for the part of smooth-faced profligate : and so the only course open to him seemed to be that of declining the action altogether. Wealth gave him freedom, and, by consequence, the weather gauge of temptation ; he could fight or flee at will. For the first time since settling in England he was beginning to think seriously of breaking up his establishment and retiring to Florence or Rome for a space. Next day, Lady Wroughton arrived in due course ; and Dorothy, who had proved so restive under the male incubus, undertook the new burden with cheerful patience, braced by an unselfish resolution to leave her brother unhampered. Harry was thus left perfectly free to bury himself in his work all the morning, and to ride out alone all the afternoon. This went on for three days : on the fourth, Maisie came to dinner. There was no party to meet her, and the evening passed to all appearance in a humdrum ordinary fashion ; yet the artist felt more perplexed and dissatisfied at the end of it than he had yet done."], [190, "182 A PARSON AT BAY. On retiring to the smoking-room that night Otis even went so far as to write instructions to a London agent to sub-let the Castle for the remainder of his term. The composition of this letter eased his mind ; though, on reflection, he decided to leave it unposted for a day or two. Withdrawal was found to be, on closer inspection, a less simple man\u0153uvre than he had imagined. It might be prudent, wise, and righteous ; yet, now that he had committed to writing an actual order for retreat, the resultant glow of conscious virtue was but a feeble one. He certainly had pursued Maisie with quiet steadfast persistence, and to suddenly break away from her, harassed as she was by home worries, looked at askance by Miss Crackanthorpe, and possibly by others, would be the part of \u2014 an unheroic man ; he had almost said of a coward. It were cowardice, then, to run away ; treachery to his better self, and to the parson whom he liked, to stay on? By what possible course could he satisfy his own pricking conscience, relieve Maisie from the trouble he had brought upon her. and \u2014 and, in fact, solve all the tiresome interfused problems of the complication ? The morning found him still racked by doubts and perplexities, and it so happened that a fresh knot was already awaiting his manipulation. Upon opening the county newspaper which lay on his study table, the first heading that met his eye was the one he had been dreading \u2014 \" Clerical Cram ming.\""], [191, "A PARSON AT BAY. 183 A glance sufficed to show that the article was by no country-town hand. It was a pithy, eloquent appeal, full of righteous warmth, on behalf of certain poor parishioners of this neighbourhood ; toilers and fishermen neglected by their pastor \"just for a handful of silver ;\" left to slave on, ignorant and uncared for, by a clergyman who thought fit to give all his thought and pains to self-aggrandize ment through private pupils. The condition of a neighbouring parish, already become a spiritual desert under a similar regime, was sketched in a few telling phrases, and a moving forecast made of the gradual retrogression of the honest fishermen and labourers of Marsh-under-Cliff. Not the name of the parish was actually given, but a dozen skilful local touches left no doubt on this head. It was a telling article, such as might have been written by an able right-thinking man, profoundly solicitous for the well-being of his poorer neighbours, and bring ing all his trained intelligence to bear on their behalf. Otis's habitual self-control enabled him to lay the paper down quietly ; but even in this restrained gesture there was a hint of fury. The article must needs make a stir, and would probably be copied into London papers : he perceived that at once. It might very well spoil Mr. Brockenhart 's tutorial prospects for a long time to come, and even rob him of the pupils already secured \u2014 and how would this act upon Maisie's existing weakness and discontent ? And further, after the joint appeal they had made"], [192, "184 A PARSON AT BAY. to their guest, the article was a deliberate insult to himself and his sister, such an insult as, in another country, might be followed by a speedy retribution. While a student in Paris, Otis had had one duel forced upon him, and had borne himself in such a fashion that he was never challenged again ; for, disregarding all the unwritten laws of French duelling, he had put a bullet through his opponent's body at the first discharge. Into that affair he had been pressed against his will, but he felt just now that nothing would please him better than to repeat it, with Parr-Nugent in the place of his former adversary. While he was yet in the first flush of his wrath, a servant knocked at the study door, announcing that Mr. Brockenhart had called, and wished to see him. \" Some one has been telling tales,\" \u2014 the thought darted through his mind like lightning. \" He has come to attack me ; or else to make an appeal ad hominem, which would be far worse.\" But he at once dismissed the alternative possibility. Parson Brockenhart was the last man to come whining to his enemy. While his servant went to fetch the visitor, Otis mused for a moment upon the whimsicality of his position. Here he sat in his own sanctum, awaiting the assault of one whom he was heartily' anxious to befriend ; for whom he had a curious respect and liking that had come in spite of himself, yet whose home peace he had, perhaps, injured irreparably"], [193, "A PARSON AT BAY. 185 But at this point the parson's entry cut short further reflection. The artist rose, drawing up his slim figure, ready to obey the instinct of self-preservation, to fight if need be, but with a certain oppression at the heart. For the moment he was almost envying the struggling gentleman, the humble parson, who, among his poor possessions, had yet one thing, the value of which is most patent to him that has lost it \u2014 a conscience void of offence. Parson Brockenhart would have been amazed, indeed, to learn that this luxurious young prince could harbour a grudging thought about him. In fact, he had seldom felt less capable of evoking envy than he did this morning, for he had walked all the way from the vicarage, and was perturbed in mind as well as tired in body ; nor was the task that lay before him a pleasant one, though widely different from anything which Otis was looking for. The artist was at first puzzled by his visitor's manner. The parson's frank cordiality, which had oftentimes given a pang to the man who loved his wife, was altogether wanting. Yet there was nothing aggressive about him \u2014 self-doubt, if anything, being apparently the keynote of his mood, \u2014 and it was tolerably clear that Maisie had nothing to do with this unexpected visit. Indeed, Otis was now assured that the parson's errand was a friendly one, realizing which, he fell suddenly from his combative attitude into quite another state. Claud Brockenhart, he knew, had always liked him ; there had been, for"], [194, "186 A PARSON AT BAY. some time, a kind of invisible link between this man and himself, a hovering sympathy which, but for the one barrier, would quickly have fanned a tentative liking into a real friendship. It was painful to one who hated even small hypocrisies to have to play the friendly host to this unsuspecting husband ; and the conjunction brought not only a sense of acute discomfort, but a flash of self-illumi nation also. Otis perceived that he had been playing with himself \u2014 in fact, lying to himself. Maisie's fascinations, and perhaps the subtle depression of her manner last night, had again upset his good resolutions. He had no serious thought of flying from temptation, and had never intended to post that letter, by the composition of which he had sopped his conscience. He felt meaner in his own eyes at this moment than he cared to acknowledge even to himself. Mr. Brockenhart, after apologizing for the earliness of his visit, had some difficulty in proceeding further : but, with the hand of duty on his shoulder, he seldom hesitated long. After a brief pause he plunged, to the astonishment of his host, into the story of Old Keylock and his daughter. \" It is the old story,\" I see, \" and old tales are apt to be sad ones,\" Otis remarked, when the speaker paused again expectantly' ; \" but excuse my saying that I don't conceive why you should bring it to me. There is, of course, no question of poverty in Keylock's case.\" \" You cheer me ! \" cried the parson, warmly. \" I"], [195, "A PARSON AT BAY. 187 confess truly that, thanks to the old man, I partly suspected you ; but you'll forgive me for so mis judging you ? \" The speaker's hand was advanced shyly, but Otis would not see it ; he was not hypocrite enough to accept the hand with any satisfaction. \" Though a stranger and a foreigner, you have been so generous to my poor,\" continued Mr. Brockenhart, \" and, if you'll let me say so, I have so much personal liking for you, that it went against the grain even to suspect you. I've never half thanked you for your generosity to my parishioners ; and we all know that the rich have many friends, and so many claims upon them.\" \" Oh, for God's sake, don't praise me ! \" muttered the other, turning away. \" And, let me tell you, the rich have no real friends, and no open enemies ; they live outside the guild of struggling humanity, fenced off from the fellow-feeling of nine-tenths of the world.\" \" Well, truly,\" remarked the vicar, with a smile, \" I'm incapable of looking at the world from the standpoint of wealth ; imagination quite fails me there. But I'm sorry to say you have one bitter enemy, and one of my reasons for calling on you to-day was to warn you seriously against him.\" \" You mean this same Keylock ? \" \" Yes ; and though, of course, I shall tell him what you have said, and do my best to dissuade him from his folly, I fear I shall hardly prevail against the old smuggler's gnarled and knotted obstinacy.\""], [196, "188 A PARSON AT BAY. \" His daughter was here, assisting my housekeeper for a time, which, I suppose, has led him to suspect \" Doubtless ; but you share his suspicions with some one else, whose name he declines to give me. The poor old fellow is mortally wounded, I fear ; he is always brooding, brooding, and blackening his heart with thoughts of revenge. I can seldom get more than a word or two out of him ; and I Uve in daily dread of some outbreak. It is an awful responsibility, this cure of souls,\" continued the parson, speaking to himself, rather than his com panion. \"The secret, which I have but just discovered, must soon become common property, and then But I must not sit here foisting my difficulties upon you : only, before going, let me entreat you to keep out of the old smuggler's way ; he was always a lawless man, and is rapidly becoming a desperate one \u2014 and he never moves from his house without that hateful deadly weapon under his arm.\" \" You can't let the man start on his tramp without so much as offering him a glass of wine ! \" mused Otis ; but aloud he said nothing. \" I must really be going now. Good-byre.\" (\" Is it better to be an inhospitable churl, or a cursed hypocrite ? \") '\u2022 Must you be going ? \" \" I must, indeed. By-the-by, though, is my wife's portrait advanced enough for inspection yet ?

At this moment anything that tended to lower his visitor's opinion of him promised to be a relief; yet, at the next, his mind veered suddenly round, and he found himself explaining tersely, but effectually, the part played in the affair by his sister and himself. \" I should not have dreamt of blaming either of you ; you have always stood my friends,\" rejoined the parson, who had not been allowed to read a dozen lines of the article as yet. Then Otis threw himself into a chair, giving rein to his bitter thoughts in silence. Mr. Brockenhart read on, at first uncomprehend ingly. His churchmanship had before now been attacked in print, and, when so roused, he had generally contrived to give his assailants more than they bargained for ; but such an unlooked-for shock as this accusation of neglect was at first too aston ishing to be accepted as an actual fact. Slowly and"], [198, "A PARSON AT BAY. 190 steadily, however, the fact, with all its correlated possibilities, took on the colours of reality. After finishing the article he sat perfectly still, muttering only, \" It is well written.\" The artist watched him keenly, noting from sheer force of habit all the muscular changes that contract the face of a man when hard hit. \" This friend of yours, this Parr-Nugent \u2014 or Cur- Hypocrite \u2014 who has put his anonymous knife into me, had a most friendly conversation with me only the other day, Otis ! \" \" I dare say. I would gladly horsewhip the sneak.\" \" I \u2014 I don't understand the man. What has possessed him ? What motive can he have ? \" \" Man's leading motive \u2014 self-interest ; and that sharpened by spite against my sister.\" \" He can't injure me much,\" muttered the parson, doubtfully, again taking up the paper ; \" even my bitterest opponents have never yret accused me of neglecting my parish.\" But as he reperused the article, his contemptuous indignation gave place to alarm. \" As a poor man, one can't help being a bit of a coward,\" he sighed, \"and if my normal enemies \u2014 those who have a doctrinal hatred of me \u2014 make the most of this chance, they may succeed in robbing me of mv pupils.\" \u2022' That's what I fear,\" said Otis, anxiously. \" What \u2022i mnter-steps can you take ? \" \" I can only stand upon my character ; and"], [199, "A PARSON AT BAY. 191 prejudice blinds men so, as I've learned by bitter experience ! Yes, the thought of the pupils makes a coward of me.

Do not be deceived by Lady Wroughton's seeming change of front. She is still plotting ; she means to rob you, if she can. We lookers-on see more of the game than you.\" \" That makes the attack all the more alarming,\" muttered the parson, paling more than he had yet done, \" and somehow the dread of losing my child does haunt me. Y'ou'll hardly understand, until you have children of your own, how a little thing of four years old can get such a grip of the heart, and how \" \" Yes, but I do understand ; I haven't studied you without learning so much.\" \" Excuse me, Otis, but you're an odd fellow. You never seem to study any one, yet you see deeper into a man than most.\" \" Oh, I'm an artist ; and a figure-painter has to be a bit of a psychologist, always prying and peering into people.\" Once more Mr. Brockenhart re-read the article ;"], [200, "192 A PARSON AT BAY. weighing every line carefully, then putting it aside without comment. Otis had first been disappointed at his sameness, for purse-fear had quenched even honest indig nation. In truth, though the parson was naturally a trifle reckless on the money question, and in clined to be little troubled with that restless dread which commonly makes a poor man regard every incident in life from one standpoint, circum stances had latterly made good the omission of nature, causing the money question to flare up, like a smouldering fire draught -struck. The man's original carelessness had been frightened to death ere this ; and the brand of purse fear now showed clearly to what flock he belonged. Moreover, the five miles of sun-smitten road which he had traversed had taken the edge off his spirit this morning, especially as, between his parish, his pupils, and his book, he had been putting a rather severe strain upon himself lately. At any rate, as he leaned upon his elbow, revolving schemes of defence and counter-attack, there presently came over him a languor that seemed to unstring every nerve in his body. He leaned back for support, but the langour would not be gainsaid. As it deepened, he found himself tottering towards the sofa, upon which he fell heavily before Otis could come to his assist ance. But nervous collapse, from which the parson was suffering, is a shrewd opponent, attacking brain as well as muscle ; and though his bodv was at rest,"], [201, "A PARSON AT BAY. 193 a heart-shaking depression took possession of him. Thought crowded upou thought, until the bitterness of death seemed to be upon him. A host of enemies seemed to be arraying themselves against him. He had not, it appeared, one fibre of energy left. How could he make a fight of it, with neither health nor money to back him ? Life was nothing but a dreary plain strewed with crushed efforts. He had never had a chance, never a stroke of luck, never a hint of encouragement from Providence. He might go on, toiling and struggling, but sooner or later his precious child, the only possession to which he clung, the one thing but for which he would be glad enough to lay down the burden of existence, would be torn from him. \" Drink some of this.\" The voice sounded as from a distance, but a hand was raising his head, and a glass was being held to his lips. He drank, and slowly, very slowly, the mist of despair thinned ancl dispersed. \" Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow. Kaze out the written troubles of the brain.\" As he murmured the words a sense of returning peace hovered in his brain. \" Cheer up, now ! \" said an encouraging voice. \"You've been half fainting; which means going through the despair without the comforting ob livion. Cheer up, you're coming round ; fainting's like dying when you're not used to it. I expect 13"], [202, "194 A PARSON AT BAY. you have been overworking yourself every way, and so this knock on the head has been too much for you. How do you feel now ? \" \"Happy; ready to die \u2014 if I could take the little thing with me.\" \" Nonsense, don't talk about dying.

Who talks of caving in ? I've got lots of fight left in me. If I lose the pupils, there's the pen ; I'll squeeze an income out of the world in spite of all the libellous rogues it contains ! I must be starting homewards, Otis. Where's my hat ? \" \" You shall start home whenever you please, but not on foot. I'm going to drive you.\" \" No need of that, man ; I'm ready for anything.\" \" So yyou may be, but you shan't leave myT house on foot.\" \" You're an awfully good fellow, Otis ; and when my time comes to die in earnest, instead of rehearsing for it in this fashion, I hope I may have such a good fellow as yrou to stand by and befriend me.\""], [203, "A PARSON AT BAY. 195 CHAPTER XIV. \"For if a man engage himself by a manifest declaration, he must go through or take a fill.\" \u2014 Bacon. ffiWl HILE tlie bulk of Miss Otis's suitors were -aMal pressing the siege so vigorously as to give a meaner cast to her conceptions of human nature in general, and sometimes even to ruffle her naturally good temper, there were two members of the invest ing force whose backwardness and diffidence gave them the character rather of hospital orderlies than true combatants \u2014 and thus earned for them her respectful gratitude. Of this diffident pair, one was Phil Brockenhart \u2014 a man born to receive confidences, to be utilized by his neighbours, and pushed aside when done with ; hampered, in short, by that serviceable good nature which is apt to land its owner at the bottom of every list. Phil was, moreover, further clogged by scrupulosity, which, without quite rising to the pitch of those romance-heroes who will rather let an heiress pine away ancl die than relax the arrogance of their poverty, did certainly give him a leaning towards the background. Perhaps he might have"], [204, "196 A PARSON AT BAY. purged himself of this defect, had he thought it at all possible that Miss Otis could fall in love with him ; but he never could rise to such a fancy -flight. He never could, as far as he could see, be anything but a looker-on ; sighing furtively when out of hearing, and drawing what comfort he could from the heavy falls of his bolder rivals. But Phil's ambulance-fellow was of quite another order ; one born, not so much to assist his friends, as to mar all their efforts for his advancement ; to make sore the hearts of relations, and, without anyT malignancy of disposition, to spoil the happiness of a good many worthy people. To the head of the familyT, in particular, Ulick Aubreyr had been a ceaseless anxiety. As the youngest and most mettlesome of the whole bunch of brothers, this Benjamin had been the special care of the present Lord Bavant ever since the old earl's death. Ulick must be made to work, which was difficult ; must be put into a crack regiment, which unfortunately7 means a pursy one ; ancl then must be made to live on his income \u2014 which was impossible. In fact, the very next necessity on the list turned out to be that of paying his annual crop of debts. He had to be extricated from constantly7 recurring difficulties, to be set upon his legs every time he was bowled over \u2014 which happened to him more often than to the average human ninepin. All this Lord Bavant had put up with like a patient ancl generous brother, or, as Ulick himself put it, \" like the d \u2014 cl good fellow he was ; \" and now"], [205, "A PARSON AT BAY. 197 was the time for a little gratitude on Benjamin's part. It was surely no great hardship to be asked to marry a charming girl, whom half the county was running after! Not at all: Ulick freely owned that the punishment was all too light for his offences ; only he must not be hurried. He would do his honest best ; but let him proceed cautiously. It was of no use to grab too eagerly at the bunch of grapes. The above was, briefly, the point of view of his lordship, and of the aspirant himself; a highly natural one, no doubt ; an obvious point of view, such as the reasonable world must perforce commend. Yret, with the usual perversity of her sex, Miss Otis might be viewing the transaction from a different standpoint. She might even reflect that the task of gluing together the scattered fragments of a cha racter, of converting to respectability a gentleman whom the less charitable were already beginning to speak of as a \" worn-out roue,\" was a difficult one ; and the privilege of giving into the hands of this interesting penitent the spending of her large fortune, one not to be snatched at too hastily. But the possibility of her regarding the question in this distorted light did not once occur to Lord Bavant. He admired and respected Miss Otis, and took a special interest in her as the future renovator of that troublesome good-hearted scamp, his youngest brother. In a word, as Ulick's wife, she w-ould be precisely the right person in just the right place ;"], [206, "198 A PARSON AT BAY. and the gist of his reflections concerning this potentially happy pair might be given in simplest syllogistic form, such as the following, for in stance : \u2014 \" Ulick Aubrey is a bachelor, in want of money and a guiding hand ; Dorothy Otis is a spinster, with money7 and a hand fit for guiding : therefore Ulick Aubrey must marry Dorothy Otis.\" The dominant cast of his lordship's mind, too, as well as a tendency to regard obedience as the cardinal virtue of woman, made him the more assured of Ulick's success. The young people must needs fall in love (at least, the lady must do so, and the gentleman must make an effort in that direction) ancl be married in due course ; and then he, the father-brother, would not only7 put Ulick straight with the world again, but help his wife to keep him so. Now, among other excuses for remissness, Ulick had lately been urging want of opportunity. He never met Miss Otis save at big dinner-parties or crowded tennis-gatherings, where she was hedged in by a host of other suitors. This might be true : but the ground of this excuse was now to be cut from under his feet ; a small dance was about to be given expressly in honour of the brother and sister, ancl, the summer being now at its height, there would, of course, be much open-air strolling in the course of the evening. When this fiat went forth, Ulick perceived at once that he was \" cornered.\" Dorothy guessed it"], [207, "A PARSON AT BAY. 199 also, ancl smiled grimly to herself while accepting Lady Bavant's verbal invitation. Nothing could exceed the countess's kindness on the occasion ; she consulted Dorothy as to the date of the party, its size and construction, and, in short, as to every detail upon which the wit of woman could exercise itself. The heiress, entering into the thing in a spirit of bitter mischief, played the exacting young beauty with a mocking relish. The dance took place about ten days after Miss Crackanthorpe's garden-party, and from the moment of her entrance Dorothy found herself the object of the earl's almost paternal solicitude. Yet she was far less impressed by this than she would have been a few months back. The atmosphere of her life latterly^had been forcing as that of a hothouse ; she had been through something like a furnace of the adulation which, though it may swell common pride, under some circumstances may be as a canker to the deeper heart-pride of a self-respecting woman. She felt different now ; altogether changed and disillusioned. Even her simple woman's vanity had somehow lost its savour ; admiration sickened, instead of pleasing her. At times she even took a cynical pleasure in finding her attractions pale before another woman's ; ancl it so chanced that she had the pleasure, such as it was, to the full this evening. Maisie Brockenhart, the only woman of her circle who could completely efface her, was destined to have a notable triumph to-night. Maisie's preparations for the war-path had been"], [208, "200 A PARSON AT BAY. undertaken in a vastly different spirit. To her, also, the last few months had brought disillusion, but the resultant discontent was of a far more dangerous type than her friend Dorothy's. The latter's languor and \u2022 disappointment were as nothing beside the bitter spirit of rebellion that was daily getting firmer hold of the young wife. For it was clear that the luck was against Claud ancl herself, and always would be. She had never believed in his pupils, and already her scepticism was justifying itself. The agitation set on foot by Parr-Nugent's article was increasing, and spreading rapidly ; and she felt convinced that it would end in the collapse of the tutorial venture. In short, there was no sort of hope of Claud's ever bettering his position materially. Under some conditions, perhaps, Maisie might have faced the prospect of continued poverty like a heroine ; for she had in her the fioditino: stuff' ' O O which, spurred by affection, will work wonders, and at one time she had cared enough for Claud to make a bold effort on their joint behalf. But that time was past, ancl she was now working herself up into a state of sullen resentment that was full of danger. She was not merely ready to take arms against Fate, but to clutch at any weapon, legiti mate or other, that might come to hand. Not that she admitted as much, however, even to herself. Her intentions this evening, as privately7 reviewed at the dressing-hour, were quite legitimate and reasonable. She meant, in the first place, to be"], [209, "A PARSON AT BAY. 201 very winning to Lord Bavant \u2014 to propitiate, if possible, the great man who might yet do some thing for them ; and, further, she proposed to be the cynosure of the ball-room, to enjoy such a triumph as must complete the conquest of the only person who had real power to help her. Aunt Mabel must be more deeply impressed than she had yet been with her niece's brilliant social possibilities, must realize from what a height Maisie would have to fall were her husband allowed to drag her down at will. Put thus upon her mettle, Maisie looked excep tionally brilliant to-night ; so much so, indeed, that her ordinary critics were silenced, and her admirers more completely enraptured than they had yet been. Lord Bavant perceived with chagrin that the crowd were bent upon putting the crown upon the wrong head. His queen of love and beauty was rejected, relegated to the position of mere waiting gentlewoman ; yet he could not but admit that little Mrs. Brockenhart looked superb. While women merely prettily7 refined and graceful, like Miss Otis, gratified the eye, Maisie captured and dazzled it ; and after its withdrawal gave the observer no peace until he looked again. She was herself profoundly gratified by her reception, ancl the first breath of triumph gave fresh power to her witchery. \"The child's like a radiant little humming-bird,\" muttered Miss Crackanthorpe, \" but \u2014 she would be safer at home in a cage ! \""], [210, "202 A PARSON AT BAY. \"Ah,\" sighed Lady Wroughton to herself, \"to think of her being thrown away on a poor parson ! \" Ulick Aubrey, who was standing near enough to Miss Crackanthorpe to hear her muttered remark, considered the humming-bird simile a poor one. He could think of no living thing worthy to be compared with Maisie ; and as he watched the men gravitating towards her from all quarters, he quite forgot the existence of the lady selected for his miraculous conversion. The troublesome task im posed by his brother, the anticipation of which had been oppressing him all day7, was already sinking to the level of a minor incident \u2014 one of those odds and ends of duty which can be got through at the last minute, ancl forgotten the minute afterwards. For a time he watched the comings and goings of the group round Maisie complacently enough, but very soon there was added to their number a slim olive-skinned man, whose presence anywhere in her neighbourhood was alway7s an offence to him. He ha 1 watched Otis less assiduously lately, because there had been little to observe. His old conception of Maisie's simplicity and innocence was still intact ; and, judging from the American's obvious neglect of her latterly, he concluded that the man had been foiled by the proof armour of these same qualities. This ideal of Aubrey's was indestructible through its very isolation ; there were no other ideals to jostle against it, and by their collapse to suggest its fundamental frailty. He was like a man who, for once in his life, has raised a flower from seed of his"], [211, "A PARSON AT BAY. 203 own planting, ancl who can by no means be persuaded to see a fault in it. In fact, to an observer who happened to hold the master-key to these three persons at the present juncture, the differing influence of Maisie's beauty upon the tw7o men would have afforded matter for curious study7. Upon the more animal of the two, the man who had lived coarsely and found the world's tastes at least high enough for him, it had acted magically \u2014 melting the coarseness, and evolving a pure loyal reverence that seemed a thing apart from the man's nature. Upon the other, the one of subtle and refined mind, whose heart had always been yearning upwards from the clay-ruts of the world, it fell blightingly \u2014 withering his trust in that philosophy of fastidiousness which, in other relations, had stood him in such good stead, making nought of his upward striving, mocking at his higher desires, breaking through every barrier set up by his better self. Where was that late whole some resolution, for instance, which had grown to the firmness of a young sapling while he was ministering to his fainting visitor ? In truth, before the evening was out, Maisie had become aware that this man's late coldness might be accepted as the outward sign of his last struggle with himself. It was close upon midnight when Captain Aubrey found himself walking down a garden path near the eastern end of the terrace with Miss Otis at his side. His mind was quite made up, he meant to"], [212, "A PARSON AT BAY. 204 do his duty ; but he could hardly have been in a worse condition for making a proposal of marriage, especially to the sister of Hereward Otis. He had been observing the artist this evening with the stealthy keenness of a jealousy just aroused from slumber, strengthened and refreshed, as it seemed, by a period of rest. To the ordinary eye, Otis was not conspicuous among the throng which buzzed round Maisie ; yet Aubrey saw much to disturb him, and in particular one brief glance thrown across the shoulders of the crowd, which would keep him wide awake for a long time to come. There would be no more carelessness on his part ; for the glance had been returned, ancl that answering flash from Maisie's ey7es struck him with a kind of terror. Aubrey7 found himself compassionating the in nocent girl at his side, who would as soon think of suspecting any evil of her beloved brother as of doubting the stability of the stars in their courses ; ancl, meanwhile, the innocent Dorothy7 was wasting compassion upon him, for she was perfectly7 cog nizant of the state of affairs as between Captain Aubrey ancl his brother. \" Poor Captain Aubrey ! \" she was saying to her self, \" he looks very miserable about it. I suppose he'll begin after the next tug at his moustache ? I wish he would make the plunge and put himself out of his pain, poor fellow. Now he's looking at his watch, doubtless with some vague hope of reprieve. No use, sir, believe me : needs must"], [213, ".1 PARSON AT BAY. 205 when a brother drives ! Ah \u2014 that heavy sigh proclaims that he is at last on the brink ! \" The sigh was indeed like that of one who offers himself to the executioner, resolved to die like a man. It was followed immediately by a declara tion in due form \u2014 or at least in a form as nearly satisfying the demands of propriety as could be expected from a man with no natural eloquence and little grace of manner, ancl whose will was pulling him in another direction. The two faces, upon which the moonlight was falling whitely, offered a quaint contrast at this moment \u2014 the man's, somewhat coarse and full featured, bearing the stamp of dissipation and recklessness, yet withal a touch or two suggestive of thoughts and hopes that once upon a time must have been worth encouraging ; the girl's, singularly pure and gentle, with its delicate oval washed by the cold light, and a faint smile, half sad, half cynical, hovering over the curved lips. Miss Otis listened patiently ; and when he had finished, allowed the silence to continue long enough to give full point to his embarrassment. Then the hazel eyes were turned to him with a quick sly gleam, and she whispered softly \u2014 \" Thank you very much for your kind invitation \u2014 Amen ! \u2014 There, don't be angry with me, Captain Aubrey; you really mustn't be, for I'm only quoting the words of my little fairy Charmian.\" She waved her fan deprecatingly, and there came a low ripple of laughter which gave Aubrey a"], [214, "206 A PARSON AT BAY. sudden boyish desire to smash something. \"Let me tell you the story,\" she continued, \" and it may help you to forgive me. When I asked Charmie to tea one clay, she responded immediately, ' Yes, yes ; ' and this brought a rebuke from her father, who muttered, ' You should say, \" Thank you for your kind invitation, Miss Otis.\" Well, a week afterwards, the little thing solemnly responded to my next request for her company with those same words \u2014 ' Thank y7ou very much for your kind invita tion \u2014 Amen ! ' Wasn't it quaint ? \" \" Oh, deuced funny7,\" retorted Aubrey, his face flaming. \" You don't laugh as I did.\" But she evidently had such a genuine childlike desire to please, and not to hurt him, and his own position at this moment appeared so profoundly ridiculous, that Aubrey's gloom broke up sud denly, and a rough excited laugh burst from him. \" Come, that's better ! \" she exclaimed cheerfully. \" Now let me take your arm while we talk it over like good friends and comrades. Shall we discuss your declaration from an outside, calmly critical, point of view ? \" \" Anything you like ! \" rejoined the reckless captain. \" Well then, speaking quite impersonally, I thought the phraseology good\u2014 but perhaps your brother supplied that ? \" \" No, no ! \" cried the gentleman, wincing all"], [215, "A PARSON AT BAY. 207 through his large frame, and muttering \u2014 \" She can roast a man, confound her ! \" \" But the chief ingredient \u2014 from the conven tional point of view, I mean \u2014 was wanting : you said nothing about affection, I think. Didn't Lord Bavant mention that among his directions ? \" \" No,\" grunted Ulick, tugging viciously at his moustache. \" Supposing I were to say ' Yes,' wouldn't that alarm you rather seriously ? \" \" I'm afraid there's no chance of that.\" \" Don't be too sure ; you are not quite out of the wood yet. A mere foreigner, a backwoods American like myrself, you know, might like to become the Hon. Mrs. Aubrey ? \" \" If it pleases you to scoff at me, I suppose I must put up with it.\" \" Pray don't say that,\" she cried with a winning kindness which melted him again, \" for I really like you. Speaking, as we agreed, like a frank comrade, I have a friendship for you. Yrou are so perfectly free from hypocrisy \u2014 if you'll permit a simple girl to compliment you, \u2014 and, had you mentioned the word ' love,' I could hardly have respected yrou as I do. Yet I must confess to being angry with Lord Bavant.\" \"Then you're putting the saddle on the wrong horse, Miss Otis ; if you only7 knew what a persistent nuisance I have been to my brother ever since my Eton days, and what sheaves of debts he has paid for me \""], [216, "A PARSON AT BAY. 208 \" Yes, yes, Lord Bavant has been a good brother, I know, ancl you do well to be grateful to him ; but he is not my brother, so I am free to look at him from a different standpoint.

And every one spoke ( if him with respect ; there was some excuse for girlish hero-worship.

WM HE next few days passed rather roughly for WSSb Captain Aubrey. Lord Bavant, aware that Ulick had done his best, forebore to make com plaints ; but as he was naturally jarred and dis appointed by his brother's failure, they tacitly consented to see as little as possible of each other until the first soreness should have worn off. Nor did Ulick in his present mood gather any solace from the youthful optimism and perennial good nature of the countess. Her smiling con dolences rather galled him just at present, and her genial schemes for tracking down some other heiress in his interest cheered him not a whit. He was, in fact, giving more thought to the concerns of Maisie Brockenhart than his own. It was well known to him that things were not as they should be at Marsh vicarage ; for, now that his fears had been freshly aroused, he was making wary inquiries in one or two directions concerning the Brockenharts. On one occasion he had even gone over to Marsh-"], [220, "212 A PARSON AT BAY. under-Cliff to reconnoitre the situation for himself, and had discovered the vicar in his study, looking pale and careworn, and writing furiously. The newspaper article, about which every one was talking, doubtless accounted for his harassed con dition. Phil, who also seemed out of sorts, had welcomed the visitor, and taken him for a cruise in the Widgeon ; and though they had not spoken together of what was uppermost in their minds, there had been enough grumbling and swearing at things in general for Aubrey to gather, through chance by-words, ample confirmation of his fears. He learned, among other things, that Mrs. Brockenhart was seldom at home now, being engaged nearly every day with her aunt at Bavant Castle \u2014 a piece of news that perturbed him the more because he was conscious of his own helplessness where any scheming had to be done. He dared not mention his fears to any one, ancl could think of no possible way of setting a guard upon Otis, or of conveying to Maisie any warning of danger. One morning, having a whole blank day before him, ancl being heartily7 tired of his thoughts, Aubrey chartered one of the Bavant sailing-boats with a view to a little mild distraction. These up river boats were smart little fair-weather craft, <rood 7 O enough for a cruise in the bay, so long as the weather was smooth ; ancl, thanks to a Ions; course of practice under Old Keylock, Ulick was a skilled boat-sailer. He rather liked knocking about the coast single-handed in a risky little craft that"], [221, "A PARSON AT BAY. 213 needed constant watching, and trusting to luck for getting home again. If it came on to blow he would scud back through the reef passage, or run into the little harbour of Kimmersham, whence he could get home by train. Starting this morning from moorings about half way between Bavant and Marsh-under-Cliff, Aubrey drifted lazily down on the ebb, towing a miniature punt astern. The breeze being off shore, he hardly felt it until abreast of Old Keylock's sandhills, when it caught him smartly, and drove him foaming past the Quay, over the bar, and into the blue bay. The wind was fair for Kimmersham, and he decided to run down the coast, lunch at the little sea-port, and beat back in the afternoon if the breeze held. Accordingly he bore away round the red buoy that marked the bar shoal, and headed for the passage through the reef. But, with sheets eased off, and nothing save a slow-heaving ground swell to be negotiated, the conditions were too favourable to suit any but an analytical philosopher, or, say, a lady passenger ; and Ulick was minded to curse the bad luck that always clogged his steps. He might as well have been at home, knocking about the billiard-balls, as sliding over the swells in this tame fashion. He detested fair-weather sailing, which left a man nothing to do but to smoke and think. However, there would be a boil of surf on either side the reef channel, and that spice of excitement"], [222, "A PARSON AT BAY. 214 would enable him to support existence for another half-hour or so. His course towards the channel, which occurred near the heel of the reef, brought him near to the line of cliffs lying between the sandhills and the headland, and he had accomplished about two thirds of the distance when, running his eye warily over the rocks under his lee, he became aware of a solitary figure pacing along the narrow ribbon of sand that bordered them. \"The devil!\" he muttered. \"That is Nan's figure. I wonder whether she has seen me ? \" He crouched down, hugging his tiller, and devoutly hoping to escape notice. He had not seen Nan for months ; in fact, thanks no doubt to other distractions, had been strong enough to cut himself completely adrift from her. Which feat of self-denial being safely accomplished, it was desir able to have no further meetings with her. Peering over the coamings of his cock-pit, he perceived that she held straight on her course, paying no heed to the little white-winged craft that was skimming along just outside the rocks ; where upon he decided to haul his wind, fetch out into the open bay7, and weather the reef instead of threading its passage. But as he put his helm over, and began to flatten in his sheets, he saw Nan pause to lean against a rock, ancl an indefinable something in her attitude gave him a sharp twinge of uneasiness. Her face was turned away from him, but the droop of her"], [223, "A PARSON AT BAY. 215 figure, its languorous leaning, and sudden collapse against the unyielding rock oppressed him oddly. Poor old Nan ! She must needs be distressed at his desertion, and doubtless had been giving him hard names ; still, Nan was not a weak puling creature to give way like this, but a proud strong girl, likely to give back scorn for scorn, coldness for coldness. She must surely have had an illness, or have been indulging in an unusually fierce quarrel with her father. Ill or well, however, it would be better to keep away from her \u2014 unques tionably better; yet somewhat difficult, too, for Ulick was far from satisfied with his treatment of Old Keylock's daughter. When his passion cooled, Keylock's long friendship for him, and the hundred kindnesses which had passed between them since the old man and the lad first went a-cruising together, hung about his mind, ancl made him flush hotly at times. Y\"et a life of pleasure had so far developed his natural powers of selfishness that these morbid promptings to remorse \u2014 a kind of aftershine of his unspoiled youth \u2014 were usually suppressible enough. Nevertheless, it is one thing to master an emotion which has only memory to set it working, another to choke it off when the original irritant cause is close at your side. It seemed to him now a low thing to sail away without giving Nan a kind word, a hint as to the difficulties of his position ; also a hard thing to let her think more meanly of him than need be. There was a little vanity mixed up"], [224, "216 A PARSON AT BAY. with his kindness. When a man has got accus tomed to be the hero of a woman's worship, it is not so easy to drop into the role of cold-blooded deserter. If she would but rouse herself and move on, he could, and would, at once haul his wind, but \u2014 but, instead of this, the slight figure sank down lower, lower, until it lay upon the sand, the head pillowed upon the dank brown tresses of the rock. Whereupon feeling submerged judgment, and Aubrey cursed himself for a heartless brute. Then, after a hasty look round, he shot his boat into the wind, tossed over his anchor, and jumped into the little punt. In a couple of minutes he was ashore, and striding towards the recumbent figure."], [225, "A PARSON AT BAY. 217 CHAPTER XVI. \" I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient.\" Shakspere. fWNFOETUNATELY for ourselves, that pecu- ________ liar \" spleen \" which our foreign critics love to dilate upon, and which, like the cheek-pouches of certain monkeys, seems to differentiate us from other races, is a very real quality ; vigorous and full-blooded enough to seriously affect the relations between man and man. If life were a procession of individuals each in his own particular rut, the English spleen might be looked upon as a simple picturesque weakness over which we could afford to make merry ; but, since our way lies, for the most part, through a net-work of cross-lanes, and the turning of every corner involves contact with our fellows, the weakness is apt to ibreed tragedy, thinly veined with farce, in place of wholesome heart-easing comedy. It is an odd weakness, too ; compounded of as many simples as was the melan choly of Jacques. Arrogance is doubtless one of the chief ingredients, and this mingles well with the imperious individualism which teaches the English man to call his house his castle. Then there is"], [226, "A PARSON AT BAY. 218 heat of blood, which pride of self-control increases by attempted suppression, as well as a cynical tendency to assume ever that our neighbour yearns to get the better of us ; and other congenital humours. Be the true analysis what it may, how ever, there remains the fact that spleen rules us at times much to our detriment \u2014 as Parson Brocken hart happened to discover about this period. For it was to this pernicious national failing that he attributed his quarrel with Lord Bavant. They had foregathered, it is true, at an unfortunate moment, when both were in a mood well-fitted for the production of a misunderstanding ; yet, had either party possessed the easeful good-humour that makes a knotty point workable by average singers, the difference might never have tightened into a quarrel. His lordship had read Mr. Parr-Xugent's article, ancl, further, had been worked upon by several persons who professed to have the well-being of the town ancl neighbourhood at heart, yet were far from unwilling to clo the vicar of Marsh-under-Cliff an ill turn. In their anti-popish zeal they had suc ceeded in making a scandal of a question which, left to itself, would soon have dwindled to its proper proportions ; and the glaring case of Mr. Tomlinson, so close at hand, had naturally given point to their indignant protests. One black sheep among his lordship's nominees was surely enough ; one neg lected and murmuring parish, the state of which was a stumbling-block to every God-fearing man in"], [227, "A PARSON AT BAY. 219 the district, was verily more than enough; \u2014 ancl so on, ancl so on. Lord Bavant had to listen to a good deal of this, and, even allowing for the venom of the parson's accusers, he thought their grievance a colourable one. He was certainly responsible for starting Mr. Brockenhart as a crammer by sending to him his own nephew, and, as a conscientious ruler \u2014 who was, however, a thought too much given to looking at questions of right ancl wrong through public spectacles \u2014 he felt that perhaps something ought. to be done to ease the minds of these malcontents. But he also felt that it was very hard on himself to have these tiresome little squabblings thrust upon him ; ancl when he drove off to Marsh to talk the matter over quietly in the vicar's study, his own grievance had acquired bulk enough to put in some claim on its own account. He sympathized with Mr. Brockenhart, and meant to befriend him as he had always clone ; but the sympathy of a man wdio happens to think himself ill-used is apt to express itself in the form of querulous comment \u2014 if not of downright complaint. Now, to meet a potential giver of many livings when thus fretted, the judicious holder of one small one should have armed himself with the patient good humour that becomes a poor mau ; instead of which, circumstances brought it about that Claud Brockenhart was himself in a state bordering upon the rampant. For that very day, but a few hours before his lordship's arrival, a"], [228, "220 A PARSON AT BAY. foolish-kind friend had brought to the vicarage a report of the countess's seeming-treacherous con duct in the affair. Apparently, it was her ladyship, from whom the vicar might naturally7 have looked for help in such a juncture, who had informed against him, and provided all the local details which gave a false stamp of truth to the article. He certainly concluded, as soon as his first heat began to evaporate, that the countess's guilt went no deeper than foolish good nature ; but that good nature had cost him dear, and the subsequent descent upon him of the earl himself, evidently primed by his enemies, and in an imperiously critical mood, was more than flesh and blood \u2014 having the least tincture of English spleen \u2014 could well put up with. Thus, what should have been a quiet talk quickly melted into a warm disputa tion, in course of which the \" retort courteous \" was followed all too quickly by the ' countercheck quarrelsome.' The encounter was a short one, however, and the combatants just managed to separate without exchanging any of those sharp home-truths which must have converted the affair into a lifelong quarrel. But the incident which can thus be related in a few words was serious enough in its effect upon the parson's position. Lord Bavant's nephew was at once withdrawn, and, as soon as this became known the parents of both the other pupils gave notice ; whereupon the reckless vicar, seething with indignant pride, dispensed with the month's notice"], [229, "A PARSON AT BAY. 221 that was clue to him, and suddenly found himself free from all tutorial trammels. The news of which, spreading quickly, was heard with misgiving by certain tradesmen of Bavant. Thus was Parson Brockenhart thwarted in his endeavour to earn the bread and butter which his sacred calling failed to supply. It was an embitter ing experience, bringing with it a soreness of mind and heart that was new to him, and darkening his whole outlook upon life. Even to a devout and humble man, accustomed to accept all his task work as part of a beneficent scheme, it is staggering to find himself, despite the most rigid self-denial and ceaseless economical striving, unable to pay for the bare necessaries of life ; ancl to such an one the consequent rebellious feeling is, perhaps, the more irrepressible for its novelty7. Poverty he had always borne cheerfully, but the possibility of complete financial collapse was like a blank wall staring him in the face, ancl tending to block out all prospect of a divinely ordered universe. And beneath his other forebodings lay the cankering thought of his child's weak health ; and the un confessed dread of erelong having to choose between surrendering her to the hungry aunt, and letting her sink, for lack of needful change, ancl the care which love cannot give without money to back it, into some fatal illness. Yret the very extremity of his need helped the parson : he could not afford to despond. The sudden dose of hard luck seemed for a time even"], [230, "222 A PARSON AT BAY. to give him new powers, to toughen some of his weaker fibres. Unjust treatment, moreover, is apt to make a man look into himself, and to take a less modest view of what he finds there than he has been wont to do. He was accused of neglecting his parish, or proposing to do so, in the interest of his pocket ; and this gave him one of those justly self-appreciative moments in which the least arrogant of men may proudly give to himself the hard-earned praise which the world has denied to him. And even while the stroke of adversity7 robbed his humble unquestioning faith of its bloom, blurring it with dark touches of rebellion, he found himself drawing closer to the hearts of his people. He may have been living over their heads, breathing a spiritual atmosphere too fine for common men ; but from this time there came a change. Bitterness must needs bring with it earthliness, and hence forward probably no one would dismiss him with the common sneer \u2014 \" Too good for the like of us.\" He was now a man among men ; a sinning and suffering man like the rest of them, as they were quick to recognize. When Bob Keylock first informed his circle at the Stone Curlew that Lord Bavant had robbed the parson of his pupils owing to a lying article in the county newspaper, his frankly expressed opinion that it was a ' d \u2014 cl shame ' was echoed all round the room. The vicar at once became an interesting rebel. His difficulties were already well-known and frequently canvassed ; but they now perceived that"], [231, "A PARSON AT BAY. 223 the struggling gentleman, about whose harassments and economies they had so often waxed facetious, was, after all, a man and a brother. Ancl these tardy eulogies of their pastor were compensated for by some powerful anathemas against the great man who had wronged him. \"How sick we need be,\" exclaims the poetess, \" e'er we make men just ! \" Quite so ; and, even then we must needs take out the change of our virtuous expenditure in injustice to some one else. The sympathy thus kindled in the snug inn parlour quickly spread to the village, and thence to every hamlet and farmstead throughout the parish. Mr. Brockenhart's cause was taken up warmly by people who had hitherto looked upon him as an uninteresting bookworm, who could never talk easily, yet would never let you alone. Just as an unimportant figure in a stage crowd will start into sudden prominence under a single beam of limelight, so was our humble parson be-heroed by7 a single touch of adversity. At first he could hardly realize that it was so, but the reception which he met with everywhere soon opened his eyes to the truth. It was a strange experience, a state of things that might have puzzled and subdued him, had not his present temper been in itself a new equipment of confidence. Parish visiting, in place of being a tedious duty, was now becoming a pleasant excite ment. He found himself getting a grip of the very people whose cold indifference had so often pained him ; his shyness was quite forgotten ; the invisible"], [232, "224 A PARSON AT BAY. barrier that had railed him off from men's sym pathies seemed to have been removed by an unseen hand. Bob Keylock, who, in spite of a lurking affection for his master, had hitherto chosen to requite his shy kindness with nothing better than condescending service, seemed to develop on a sudden into a humble friend, a servant whose anxious loyalty sought to express itself through ceaseless little attentions; and in this connection Bob might have stood for the whole parish. The alteration of attitude was on all sides the same in kind, though various in quantity ; and the parson took further comfort from the reflection that adversity could not have raised such a crop of sympathy save from a good seed-bed. There must always have been respect, and a certain liking, for him, and upon these misfortune had acted as a warm April rain upon a tender young growth. The vicar's sermons also took some reflected light from the new mental phase through which he was passing. He had a fine natural gift of eloquence, when at all moved, ancl had always been rather a noted preacher in these parts ; but here, again, he had been found too spiritual and exalted by \" the general.\" Now, at length, the special human ring which had been awanting began somehow to find its way into his oratory, together with a confidence and power hitherto denied to him. His fame as a preacher was spreading fast. Thus, everywhere outside the walls of his own home, was Claud Brockenhart met bv a srowinsr * O O"], [233, "A PARSON AT BAY. 225 cordiality that marked his attainment of what a few weeks ago had seemed an idle dream. Striving vainly to evoke any heart-warmth from his neigh bours, he had always felt the hopelessness of attempting to touch their souls ; but his chance had come at last, and he fell to the work of arousing his flock with a feverish energy. But, unhappily, this wide reaction in his favour stopped short at his own hall-door ; from his wife he got no sympathy. When, upon returning from a visit to her aunt at the Castle, Maisie heard from Claud's own lips an account of his quarrel with the earl, she listened at first in perfect silence. Then, putting away as so much lumber his pleas of justification, poured forth with all the eloquence of wrath, she said quietly \u2014 \" I have been expecting something of this sort ; I knew you would never keep pupils, even if you got them. Your temper, it seems, has now ruined us effectually. You have contrived at a stroke to cut off the only source of income, outside this miserable living, that was open to you, and to offend your only powerful friend. Let me ask what your plans are now ? Would you like me to try for a post as governess or companion, as we cannot possibly afford to keep house respectably ? My aunt, of course, will do nothing \u2014 thanks to your unhappy want of reasonableness and self-control. There doesn't seem to be any one else worth offending ; but if there were, you would doubtless be equal to the task. Your rampant attitude has done all the harm there was to be done.\" 15"], [234, "226 A PARSON AT BAY. The parson's heat evaporated, as would often happen when Maisie took the scourge in hand, but his wrath deepened as he cooled. \" You consult my feelings without intending it,\" he rejoined in a tone of polite bitterness, which fell strangely upon his own ears as well as upon hers : \" you labour to wound me, yet heal the wounds even as you deal them. One sharp feature of my trials has always been the shrinking dislike of cutting off your Uttle comforts and luxuries. Hitherto, I have not touched them ; I've cut down my own food, and done without things that my poorest parishioner would scorn to forego, but have never pressed these mean economies upon you. It must now be part of ' my plans,' about which you inquire so scoffingly, to ask you to give up some small pleasures ; and that duty you have robbed of half its pain. I shall at once give a month's warning to both cook and housemaid, and look out for a common general servant. Some cheap country girl must be hired in place of the nurse also. And I shall look out for a purchaser of the pony and trap.\" \" K you sell the pony I shall hire traps at the Stone Curlew. I never bargained to immure myself in a paltry country village with a man who lives between the covers of a book, and neglects his wife for a spoiled child of four years.\" Maisie gave this forth, not by way of a sudden spurt of anger, but in a voice of cool resolute defiance, which her look and gesture further"], [235, "A PARSON AT BAY. 227 emphasized. Her husband's face as he listened to her was a complete illustration of the Shaksperian aphorism \u2014 \" Though little fire grows great with little wind. Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all.\" His fire was quite blown out for the nonce, and the gust that scattered it struck cold upon his heart. Angry words had passed between them before ; and, of late especially, Maisie had been moody and wayward, rasping and soothing him by turns : but he had never hitherto been met with words of flat rebellion, uttered in a tone of deliberate insult. \" It would almost seem,\" he said slowly, and with difficult steadiness, \" that you are seeking a pretext for quarrelling with me finally, for putting me out of your heart altogether ? You speak: as an enemy, anxious to strike home, but seeking vainly for something to excuse the blow.\" Maisie accepted the imputation without a word. Her eyes were hard and resolute ; she had the look of one who has thrown down a gage and hopes to see it taken up. But Claud had no heart to join battle with the wife whom he had sworn to love and to cherish. He felt as though he had fallen suddenly from some high cliff, and were lying half stunned at its foot, trying to piece together the scattered fragments of what had been, but a moment since, his chief hopes and aims. Maisie's figure, as she stood confronting him, grew dim to his gaze. He was the more crushed and bewildered because"], [236, "228 A PARSON AT BAY. he had latterly, through all her words, contrived to keep his own temper. Regret for the troubles he had brought upon her had led to greater patience and forbearance in his treatment of the young wife. He had worked through regretful reflection to the admission that he ought never to have asked her to marry him ; and probably would never have taken that step but for a misconception bred of his last wife's devotion. From poor Mary he had gathered an impression that a wife must needs be a veritable helpmeet, a skilful economiser, not a waster of substance. After her death the waste in his house hold had been prodigious, his income had seemed literally to shrink through her loss ; but he had latterly come to realize that the old peaceful time, with its blessed possibility of making both ends meet, was the result, not of ordinary care, but of profound devotion on Mary's part. She had given up every little pleasure, had consented to be put aside by society, to be hated by would-be extrava gant servants, to be a household drudge to whom such a thing as holiday was almost unknown ; her life with him had been a long self-sacrifice for his peace, the pathos of which had now come home to him. Aforetime he had accepted the results of a woman's devotion, after the manner of men, pretty much as matters of course ; but Time had now wrought out such a revenge as Mary would have fought against with all her strength ; that old blindness of his had made possible most of his late misfortunes. Yet, his eyesight being now restored"], [237, "A PARSON AT BAY. 229 to him, he had been moved to feel the more for the difficulties of Maisie's position, to look leniently upon her discontent ; and his conduct had kept pace with his feeling. But resentment may grow the faster when thus deprived of any outlet or excuse, as he was now about to discover. For when he raised his head, and his eyes met hers in a final mute appeal to save their married life from becoming a mockery, he saw that the case was hopeless. \" Let us forget and forgive, and love each other in spite of all,\" his eyes seemed to say, but his lips were not allowed to utter the words. The unspoken appeal had but inflamed her, and her smouldering resentment found vent in the harshest stroke that she had ever dealt him. \" I don't care for you,\" she burst forth suddenly, \" I care nothing for you. If we were to part to morrow I should be glad, most glad, to think that we were never to meet again ! \" He winced and shrank back at her words ; but his lips muttered \u2014 she thought he was praying for her. Then her anger was heightened, and all the goading of conscience that she had suffered of late, unknown to him, seemed to concentrate itself in one spasm. \" Don't pray for me,\" she said fiercely. \" I won't have your prayers. I don't believe in your religion. I don't believe your faith will long survive : it is shaken at the roots ; you'll soon be preaching what at heart you believe to be a miserable lie. You feel"], [238, "A PARSON AT BAY. 230 now that God has mocked you ; you'll soon come to know that there's no God to mock ! \" Then, with a dumb upraising of his hands, and a grey drawn face, Claud wavered to the door, and left her."], [239, "A PARSON AT BAY. 231 CHAPTER XVII. \" We are not ourselves When nature, being oppressed, commands the mind To suffer with the body.\" Shakspere. jjlplj FEW weeks later Parson Brockenhart might \\lmM have been found in his study, engaged in what had now come to be his principal occupation \u2014 that of brooding over his situation. In former days the only picture that hung on the walls of the little den \u2014 a portrait of his wife Mary \u2014 had been the silent spectator of many hours of strenuous labour, carried through in happy freedom, while the original of the picture was engaged in her more trivial tasks ; no echo of the latter being ever allowed to penetrate into the sanctum where the Great Work was proceed ing. Now the portrait looked down upon the same scene, with the same solitary figure engaged osten sibly upon the same task; yet all was changed. Hope, the invisible assistant and sweetener of toil, was no longer present at the worker's elbow. Everything was in its old place : the old semi orderly dishevelment prevailed : the reference volumes were stacked here and there in the old"], [240, "A PARSON AT BAY. 232 random-seeming fashion, and the pile of manu script, now grown to imposing dimensions, occupied its old position on the table. The only visible symptom of change was to be found in the attitude of the worker, who, instead of bending busily over the table, was huddled up in his armchair with his legs uncomfortably stretched upon a higher one. And, even so, it might be assumed at a first glance that he was thus resting the body with a view to giving the mind fuller play : in a moment or so the legs, now so much in evidence, might disappear, the huddled shape be thrown forward with a jerk, and the idle pen clutched by a swift hand. But the expectant onlooker might have waited long for such a demonstration, and waited in vain. The parson was regarding the Great Work with half-closed eyes. He had been looking through it for the last hour or so, reading a page here and a page there \u2014 an exercise that used formerly to bring unfailing cheer with it. He could feel a just satis faction in the work. Into it had been put the essence of a lifetime's reading and thinking, compacted into the most telling form by unwearied manipulation, pared and trimmed by7 nights of labour. His natural fairness, too, had given a kind of aroma to the book that would make it readable by all but the most bigoted opponents. He had often pictured the honest doubter, the man striving vainly to get within arm's length of faith and close with it, studying his work, and, finding some light thrown upon dark places, gathering comfort as he went"], [241, "A PARSON AT BAY. 233 deeper and deeper into it. That had been a favourite conception of his ; one full of consolation when his want of personal hold of men oppressed him. And now there remained but the last quarter of the book to be written, six months more of close toil would convert this idle heap of paper into a working engine for the relief and comfort of many a harassed doubter. But would that six months' work ever be accomplished ? That was now the great question with him ; for if there were no hope in the book, there was none in any other direction. Lord Bavant had gone abroad without holding further communi- cation with him, and evidently intended to let him fight out his battle alone. The lost pupils, it ap- peared, could not be replaced ; for the district would have none of him, and his advertisements had failed to tickle the palate of a single parent at a distance. The Great Work was his last entrenchment against the attacks of Fate, and he was growing doubtful of his power to hold it. His old pluck and energy were certainly failing, nor had he yet quite realized how much ill health had to do with this. He lacked experience which teaches the long-practised invalid to label despair, \"hypochondria,\" and to keep the eyes straining, even from the heart of a black mood, towards the possible brightness beyond. However, his increasing weakness had so far impressed him as to take him into Bavant this morning with a view to being \" set straight \" by Dr. Brading ; who promptly informed him that his heart was weak, and his"], [242, "234 A PARSON AT BAY. nervous system much overstrained, and that the desired \" straightness \" was only attainable through rest and freedom from worry. Peace of mind was all that he needed \u2014 that medicine so often and so easily prescribed, but dispensed, alas ! by no human chemist. He had also put the old questions as to Charmian, and received the old answers. Upon reaching home again early in the afternoon his strength had failed suddenly, as at the Castle on a former occasion ; and this time, the house being empty, he had been obliged to work through the subsequent bit of despair without assistance. When it passed he fell to dipping into his book for comfort, hoping perhaps to strengthen himself by arguments built up when his mental state was sounder. But the arguments fell strangely flat, and he presently sank back on the chairs in the attitude in which we found him. Maisie's hard saying as to his lessening faith were now rankling in his mind. She had since regretted them, but their sting remained. They were utterly false, he kept repeating to himself, yet \u2014 where was the old zest in his book ? Why could he no longer physic his pain by the old beloved labour? Why was it that a creeping sense of its utter futility kept stealing over him? He felt strangely solitary : the house was dead silent ; there was nothing to hinder the black thoughts that kept surging through his brain and singing in his ears. He was too tired to go out again ; incapable also of reading ; incapable of doing anything beyond"], [243, "A PARSON AT BAY. 235 listening to the miserable tune ground out by his restless thoughts. At length the leaden afternoon, during which he seemed to have grown so strangely older, wore itself away ; and the sunset light, pouring through an opening in the laurels to gild all the shabby furniture of the little den, found its occupant still alone. But while the golden fire still lingered, warming him like a touch of human sympathy, and sending a bright thread or two through the dun pattern of his musing, there came a sound, the sweetest known to him \u2014 the one sound that still had power to make a moment musical, despite the counter-clashing of a score of disappointed hopes ; there came a pattering of little feet in the passage, and a prattle of four-year-old laughter. Then the door was pushed open, and the last sun-rays found something better to rest upon than the furniture. \"Oh, daddy, daddy,\" cried the child, pattering swiftly across the room, \" I s'pect it must be my birthdy-day again 'cos Aunt Mabel has given me a lovely lace pocket-handerchuff : and I s'pect I shall have another birthdy-day soon, 'cos she has promised me a 'normous lot of other things ! \" Reaching the table, the child laid a dainty little square of laoe upon the Great Work, pulling at her father with both hands to quicken his admiration. But, for once, Charmian had struck a wrong note. These constantly recurring presents from Aunt Mabel were like doses of poison to the loving jealous father ; and truly he was just now in a mood fitted"], [244, "236 A PARSON AT BAY. rather for the receiving, than the giving, of sympathy. The profound egotism of a young child, moreover, has a certain crushing quality of its own when the mind is weary and heavy-laden. \"She only cares for herself,\" he mused, trying vainly to rouse himself sufficiently to meet the invitable four-y7ear-old demands and exactions ; \" she would be just as happy away from me : and she doesn't see that I'm a miserable broken-spirited dog, without a bit of fight left in me.\" This morbid verdict seemed to be a sound one ; for Charmian, finding her father unwilling to play with her, noticed him no more than if he had been a chair or a table, but proceeded to arrange a bed for her doll between some books, to cover it with the lace handkerchief, and hush it to sleep ; stopping only to peremptorily request ' old daddy ' not speak for fear of waking the precious thing of wax and tow. The parson watched these proceedings with a bitter glance, murmuring presently \u2014 \" You don't care a rap for your old daddy, do you?\" \" Hush, hush ! you're not to speak, 'cos Lily's nearly kite as'eep.\" \" If Aunt Mabel were to take you away alto gether, and show you shops and dolls enough, you'd never feel a pang of regret at leaving me, would 9\u00bb\u00bb \" Is Auntie Mabel goin' to take me away ?

I doubt whether you would give me that much thought ; you'd forget my existence in less than a week.\" \"When do you think she'll take me away, daddy ? \" \"I don't know \u2014 as soon as the breaking straw has been added to one's burden, I suppose.\" \" I couldn't go yet, 'cos Lily's got a bad cold, and I couldn't let her go away until she's kite better.\" \" She wouldn't care a rap ! I was a fool to refuse that hankering woman's offer. . . . Charmie, what would you say if your daddy were to throw himself into the river ? \" \" Oh, daddy, you'd get so wet \u2014 I'd dry you with my new handerchuff! No, I wouldn't, 'cos the lace might be spoilt.\" \" Not a rap, I say ! With a few gewgaws to console her, she'd take on a new parent as readily as a new doll \u2014 more so, more so ! Good Heavens, to think how we lavish our love upon these little breathing lumps of selfishness ! She cares for me just as much as my wife does, no more : woman child and woman-grown are one and the same thing ; a new dress is their heaven, the person who ministers most to their pleasure their god. . . . Charmian, why don't you go up to the nursery? You'd get a deal more pleasure up there.\" To his surprise, the child began to gather up"], [246, "238 A PARSON AT BAY. her doll and its belongings, carefully wrapping up the new handkerchief in an old duster which she found in the corner. With her arms full, she then began to move to and fro between the door and window, as though in doubt what to do next. \"Well, the door's open, child, and you've got your doll \u2014 what more do you want? \u2014 the cushion I'm sitting on, I suppose, or the coat off my back to make a bed for your waxen idol ? \" The child did not herself know what she wanted. Her father's words had fallen blankly upon her ears, but his strangely bitter tone had been gradually working its effect upon her feelings. She stood before him now, wide-eyed and wonder ing ; vaguely aware that something was wrong, but too much frightened by his coldness to offer the only form of consolation that was known to her. \" Run away, child ; let us have no affectation \u2014 frank selfishness is a kind of virtue in its way.\" She placed a tiny hand upon his arm, shyly and timidly, but he shook it roughly off. \"Come, be honest, Charmian. Honesty is the next best thing to the love which you haven't got to bestow.\" Then the small heart grew full, the Uttle head drooped until the gold curls fell loosely upon the dusty table, and the child sobbed miserably. \" Nonsense, Charmie ; don't be such a little humbug ! Why don't you go ? \""], [247, "A PARSON AT BAY. 239 More sobs, and a twitching of the father's pale face. Nothing else at present. The cool twilight was deepening into dusk, and with it the shadow that lay heavily upon the parson's mind; cool dews were falling upon the grass outside, but none fell upon his parched heart. He said to himself, \" She shall go, and I will lead a rational life \u2014 for self alone. I will drudge along, reckless and indifferent as the rest, and the hearts of my tradesmen shall be warm once more. My wife shall have the spending of the three hundred \u2014 the price put upon my child; and her heart will warm together with my butcher's and grocer's \u2014 even as it has grown chill with theirs. Three hundred a year will bring back the light to any woman's eyes, and smooth the frown of any tradesman ! \" \" Oh, daddy, I love you ! \" gasped the child between her sobs. The man's face twitched again ; but he turned aside to the window, and would have none of her. \" You don't speak to me, daddy ! \" It seemed that the siren-voice had lost its charm : the tall figure remained immovable at the window, while the small heart poured forth its load of desolation. For the first time in her life, perhaps, Charmie was allowed to weep unsoothed ; and, after a time, the weight of her anguish became more than she could bear. With a sharp cry, and a stretching forth of tiny hands, she tottered across the room"], [248, "240 A PARSON AT BAY. and flung herself upon the floor at his side, clutch ing at the shabby trousers which brushed against her head. \" Oh, my little thing, my only one, my blossom girl, my flower ! \" \u2014 in a moment she was snatched up and pressed to the obdurate-tender heart ; and the broken father, who in his strongest moments was less of a stoic than he could have wished, carried her away to his working-chair, pressing the wet cheek to his, and hiding his blurred eyes in the soft curls. So they remained for some time ; and so, could the father's inmost wish of the moment have been gratified, they would have passed to where no human hands could separate them. When at length there came a sound of voices in the passage, and the door was flung open, it was almost too dark to resolve the indistino-uishable O mass by the table into its component parts, and Phil Brockenhart, who was the first to enter, uttered a vague \" Hullo ! \" of surprise. Then the tall figure rose, with the small one still clinging to it, ancl Phil exclaimed, \"It is you, then, Claud ? I've brought y7ou two visitors. We've been tramping round the house in the dark, and, seeing no light in here, were about to give up the search for you.\" The visitors were Aunt Mabel and Miss Otis. Phil had rowed them down the river, and they were to have driven straight home from Marsh bridge ; but, on disembarking, Aunt Mabel had insisted"], [249, "A PARSON AT BAY. 241 upon coming up the hill to pay Charmian a visit. Dorothy's objections on the score of lateness, and so on, were quickly put aside; Phil, in spite of his glum looks, had to pilot them up to the vicarage. These two young people, Aunt Mabel was well aware, were the only serious opponents with whom she had now to reckon. They were as a pair of vigilant sentinels, always standing between her and Mr. Brockenhart, never allowing her to come to close quarters with him. Dorothy contrived to fill up almost every day with unavoidable engagements for her, utilizing Phil for the tiding over of any dangerous spare hours. If her guest suggested a casual call at the vicarage of Marsh-under-Cliff, it always happened that they had arranged something special and couldn't possibly do without her. If Charmian were safely captured and carried off to the Castle, the afternoon was sure to be marred or cut short on some pretext or other. In short, they were both so politely attentive to Lady Wroughton's comfort, so assiduously anxious for her pleasure, that she was constantly wishing the young people at the other end of the county. Nor did Maisie help much ; Maisie seemed to have grown indifferent, or else to have given up all hope of converting her husband to a common-sense view of his own interests. But this subtle opposition, though a temporary hindrance, did but whet Aunt Mabel's longing to capture the little fairy whose hold upon her had 16"], [250, "242 A PARSON AT BAY. strengthened so steadily. She meant to have Charmie for her own \u2014 her very own ; to carry her off to the West Indies, where she had decided to live out, with an elder brother who had been settled there for many years, the remainder of her days ; to surround the child with such luxury and happiness as the semi-bankrupt father could never hope to give her. To gain this end she was delaying her departure, for this she would go on doggedly waiting and working. Her heart was now wrapt up in this capture of Charmian ; all the patient strength of a strong woman was to be given to it : and every day that passed, not only added to her passionate desire, but made its attainment more probable. Claud Brockenhart was daily losing heart and hope : sooner or later his surrender would be an accomplished fact, and then \u2014 then she would revel all through the sunny autumn of her life in the happiness which had been denied to its spring and summer. The little tender thing would learn to twine round her, to love her utterly, to forget the dull old home in the foggy island. Charmie would grow hale and strong in the mountain air; or, if not, should be carried from clime to clime until the right one were found for the unfolding ancl development of the fair sweet bud. She should get strong : money7 and love together may command health, as well as every other blessing. The father must be sacrificed \u2014 for the present ; in the end, he would be the happier. She would loyally fulfil her contract ; he should want for nothing ; Maisie would learn to care for"], [251, "A PARSON AT BAY. 243 him again as soon as the pressure of poverty was removed, and in some larger environment his really creditable gifts might at length bring him fame and fortune. It was a sublime scheme \u2014 in a way ; a structure of love, true, tender, and thirsting for self sacrifice, founded upon a base of cruel and deadly selfishness. Lady Wroughton had started upon the boating expedition this afternoon with the full intention of breaking through her guards, for, thanks to Phil's affection for his brother and Dorothy's womanly wit, all attempts to elude them by stealth had proved fruitless. Happily, her unexpected decision on landing from the boat had quite nonplussed them ; and so it came about that Dorothy's horses, which by this time should have taken them halfway back to Bavant, were idly champing their bits by the bridge, while Aunt Mabel found herself confronting the foe in the heart of his own sanctum. As the rich woman and the poor man \u2014 the two whose dogged antagonism had abated no wit during the time they were kept asunder, whose strife had been none the less bitter latterly because hand-to hand combat had been denied them \u2014 at length found themselves thus face to face, the young people became for the nonce a pair of lay figures. Mr. Brockenhart forgot even to shake hands with Dorothy, or to offer her any verbal greeting. He saw only the firm upright figure, the deeply lined face, the stern forehead and hungry eyes of his powerful antagonist. Charmian was clinging to his"], [252, "A PARSON AT BAY. 244 knees with her face hidden : she had no company manners at command now, and nobody wanted them. Phil ancl Dorothy seated themselves, accepting instinctively the part of silent spectators of the little drama. Mr. Brockenhart struck a match and lighted his single candle, but made no attempt to open a conversation. Nor did Lady Wroughton resent his incivility ; they were paying each other an in voluntary compliment by an assumption of equal honesty. But it seemed to the spectators an unequal match. The lady, weaker by twenty years, was the stronger in all other respects. Strong in will, strong in health ; her rich attire proclaiming that the power of wealth was hers also ; her erect carriage contrasting with the droop of the slim figure before her. The man, pale and hollow-eyed ; dressed in an ancient boating coat ; planted in his shabby little study with its shabby furniture, with nothing of power or promise about him. Frightened, too : it was apparent that his courage was low. He had been going down the hill while his adversary steadfastly held her place on the summit. For all her fervent desire, moreover, she had not the heart-shaking issue at stake that he had. Nor had she any scruples to contend with. Her motives, as revised and edited by herself, were unimpeach able ; her conscience abetted her. Hers, too, was the inestimable advantage of having to think onlv of herself. There was no voice whispering to her, as"], [253, "A PARSON AT BAY. 245 to him, \" Your capital is nearly run out ; you are clogged with debt, and have quarrelled with the only man through whom promotion could have come ; your pupils have vanished and cannot be replaced; your Great Work has come to a Great Full-stop. You have neither health nor spirit left for much striving : the Little Thing is ailing, and you can do nothing for her ; you may keep her, if you please, but \" Dorothy had it in mind to exclaim, \" Don't be hard on him ! \" but the words would not come. Phil's honest long countenance clearly proclaimed his indignation against Aunt Mabel ; but he, too, looked hopeless. He could clo nothing ; they must fight it out between themselves. Either way, as it seemed, Claud must go to the wall. The loss of Charmian would take the sap from his life at a stroke ; if he retained her he must embrace poverty completely and finally \u2014 and then what of Maisie ? Phil was uneasy about her. She raged against Claud's determined economies, thwarting them whenever she could. And anxiety about his brother had quickened Phil's perception in another direction \u2014 he had begun to look askance upon the intimacy between Maisie and the artist ; and he thought \u2014 though he was not yet quite certain \u2014 that Dorothy was touched with a like creeping uneasiness. There might be further trouble, of a new and intolerable kind, in store for Claud. As he sat thinking thus, with his big chin"], [254, "A PARSON AT BAY. 246 grasped by both hands, Lady Wroughton made her opening remark. \" I have not seen you for some time, Mr. Broc kenhart, and you will naturally infer from my present visit that I am about to renew my old offer ? \" Mr. Brockenhart shivered slightly, clasping the child more closely to his knees. \"That, however,\" she resumed in a level voice, measuring him with a calm pitiless regard which affected him like a waft of chill air, \" would be a mistaken inference. I shall never renew that offer. I made the suggestion deliberately, after due thought, and the offer will remain as a permanent factor in the situation, which you can regard or not at will. You are free to accept it at any time by a word or a line, or to treat it as though it had never been made ; this present unavoidable allusion to it is the last that will pass my lips. Do you under stand me ? \" \" Yes, you are \" But the polite lie stuck in Claud Brockenhart's throat ; he could not achieve the \" very good \" that propriety seemed to demand. \" Well, that question being satisfactorily disposed of, I have a separate proposition to make. It has nothing to do with the other ; you are to consider the two quite separately, on their respective merits. I hear from Maisie that your pupils have left, and that your financial difficulties are increasing \" \u2014 here the speaker threw a glance at Miss Otis, as though she would say \u2014 \" You must listen to these"], [255, "A PARSON AT BAY. 247 family matters, whether you like it or no, since you have chosen to make yourself my watchdog.\" Dorothy rose at once, but was detained by a whispered word from Phil. \" You see, Mr. Brockenhart, I am compelled to consider your position from the point of view of Maisie's interests, which I fear have occupied too little of your attentions. It is hard for a young bride, a mere girl like my niece, to have to drudge almost like a servant. Her health is suffering, and no wonder. I look upon your marriage, if you will allow7 me to speak with perfect frankness, as the most reckless and fatuous proceeding of the kind that has ever come under my knowledge. The child had no one but a selfish indifferent father to watch over her, and has suffered accordingly.\" A faint bitter smile passed over Mr. Brockenhart's face, but he made no attempt to defend himself. \" I have no doubt,\" the candid critic continued, after pausing in apparent expectation of hearing something apologetic or regretful, \u2014 \"no doubt whatever, that my proposal will prove distasteful to you ; nor can I pretend that its acceptance will give any pleasure to myself. But it is my plain and positive duty to help Maisie in her strait, and I believe that, as a conscientious man, you will hardly refuse to second my efforts. My intention was to offer myself as your guest, your paying guest, for a period ; and during that time to allow my maid to work for Maisie, as well as to keep another servant for her at my own expense, and further to"], [256, "A PARSON AT BAY. 248 assist her with my counsel and advice. This appears to me to be the most feasible arrangement for procuring some rest and ease for my nieee, and, at the same time, giving you an opportunity for making a careful review of your position, and arranging some plan of campaign for the future.\" The speaker's tone was resolutely calm and judicial ; she believed herself to be making an honest effort to mend the fortunes of Maisie and her husband. But beneath her smooth delivery lay a tense eagerness which betrayed the source and motive of her scheme. Her unconfessed aim was to again establish herself under the vicarage roof, to wear away by daily and hourly friction the parson's opposition to her heart's desire, the energy of which had developed a power of hypocrisy that was quite foreign to her. Her self-deception was complete, and the man who confronted her, with twitching muscles and eyes bright with fear, knew that it was so. He was now leaning upon the table at his side for support, facing her instinctively, but with the look of one who has taken a mortal wound. The shaken father could not force his mind to attack the new problem presented to him ; his thoughts utterly refused to concentrate themselves upon the main issue. He knew that his child was the stake for which they were play7ing, but the game had suddenly become too complex for his shaken faculties. He durst not, in face of the present hopeless outlook, give her a flat refusal ;"], [257, "A PARSON AT BAY. 249 and, instead of turning his mind like a lightning flash upon the whole question, he kept groping among foolish little psychological items. \" How strange that a hard strong woman should have become thus possessed by a child's beauty ; an honest woman thus transformed into a cunning hypocrite ! \" \u2014 with such irrelevancies he was busying himself while his whole future hung in the balance. It was as though one threatened with a lightning stroke were stooping to pick flowers while the storm crashed and rumbled over his head. \" Why do you torture him so ? \" said Phil, breaking the silence with a fierce hissing whisper, which, in his present condition, seemed the only alternative to a shout. \"If you care to help Maisie, the road is open to you ; you are rich \u2014 give her money ! \" But Aunt Mabel never threw Phil a glance, nor acknowledged his presence with a gesture ; her hungry eyes were fastened upon her victim, her heart was swelling with hope. \" Mr. Brockenhart,\" muttered Dorothy, \" do let me help you \u2014 oh, do let me I You know I have more than I want \u2014 money is nothing to me. You could easily repay me, in time.\" \" If I had any hope of that,\" he answered, \" I would borrow of you ; but I have none. I can get no pupils ; I can't write ; I don't believe in my own book \u2014 it is nothing but a Petitio Principii from beginning to end \" Then he began, losing all consciousness of their presence for a moment, to"], [258, "A PARSON AT BAY. 250 repeat aloud, as though from his pulpit, the pitiful lament of Job : \u2014 \" Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul ; Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures?\" After that he paused, as though about to preach on the above text ; then fell away into low discordant laughter. But he returned to himself quickly, and mur mured, in his natural voice \u2014 \" I am rather out of health, and lose control of myself at times. Lady Wroughton, you must do just as you please \u2014 as you think right. I cannot trust my judgment now. You had better come and help Maisie, only \u2014 only,\" he concluded, rising suddenly to his height, and allowing his stricken heart to pom7 itself forth in one loud cry, \" O merciful God, don't take this Little Thing from me!\""], [259, "A PARSON AT BAY. 251 CHAPTER XVIII. \" Yea, but, Franion, conscience is a worm that ever biteth, but never ceaseth.\" \u2014 Robert Greene. [UlEKEWAKD OTIS was a true artist\u2014 one of !_____! the happy fraternity whose best moments are better than those of all other mortal men ; who know the deep ecstasy which flows from a concep- tion half-born, still trailing its clouds of glory, with the gorgeous colours of a whole eastern hemisphere still clinging round it, and all its magic possibilities still glowing and palpitating : but he was also, as we have seen, touched with something like the Comte de Charney's passion for T analyse philoso phique. His reflective faculties were constantly drawing him, in spite of himself, outside the art- groove, and some new and mordant experience would be needed to make him cease to be, even for a time, a contemplative animal. Such an experience did at length come to him in form of a personal passion, with nothing abstract or ideal about it \u2014 an earthy, soul-killing passion, such as can lay waste the better parts of a man, and give him just those powers for evil which Nature's"], [260, "A PARSON AT BAY. 252 kindly hand has never implanted in him. From the moment wThen, after his short sharp effort at self-conquest, he relapsed and gave himself the rein, his falling away was rapid. He took up a new mental attitude, reflected no more, troubled himself no more with the problems of life ; he had come to the point \u2014 which the baser soul is apt to start from, but the nobler one to reach only after many windings and backward strivings \u2014 where a man begins to call himself the plaything of Chance or Fate ; and to think, with hypocritical self-pity, of what he might have been if only circumstances had been kinder. This state had lasted with the artist for some weeks when, much to his astonishment, he met with a sudden abrupt check. Perhaps nothing so readily takes the gloss off wrong-doing, and makes such complete havoc of the fairy scene which has encompassed it, as to be found out : and this was just what happened to our dreaming artist. To be found out is to be supplied with new organs of vision ; to see with the eyes of the finder out ; to hate him, perhaps, for his coarse conception of one's ideal, but to realize that others will share it, and see as crudely as himself. Otis had been discovered by an inferior personage, one of those who jump, as a matter of course, to the worst possible conclusion, who cannot by any7 possi bility comprehend the emotional shades of finer souls ; yet he was forced to admit that the letter"], [261, "A PARSON AT BAY. 253 which announced the discovery affected him profoundly. The crudest and most commonplace phrases, if the facts they narrate be but hard and heavy enough, may serve to knock the breath out of a man pretty thoroughly ; and this epistle, for all its schoolboy simplicity, shivered the artist's fine dreams to pieces. The bubble burst none the less completely for being pricked by a clumsy hand, and the startled artist found himself standing once more upon the solid earth, a reflecting animal, able to think and see clearly, and to realize whither he was drifting. What had been discovered ? Merely that he had been meeting Maisie in the twilight by the river, strolling with her along the path through the reed-beds \u2014 yet that might, and probably would, suffice to compromise her fatally with a censorious world. How these meetings had been discovered Otis could not conceive. He had rowed down in the dusk to a solitary creek near the seaward end of the marshes, and, while he sat in his boat, Maisie had stood talking to him from the foot-bridge, which commanded a long stretch of the path both ways. No other boat had passed up the creek, not a soul had passed along the path; who could possibly have seen them together ? Yet this letter indicated that they had been watched more than once : so far it was clear enough, though certain dark hints and threats which it contained in addition were"], [262, "A PARSON AT BAY. 254 more or less obscure. Some course, however, was to be taken \u2014 and, whatever it might be, it would too probably lead to public scandal \u2014 if Otis failed to keep a certain appointment which the letter offered. The letter had arrived in the morning ; on the evening of the same day, after many hours of haggling with the question, he was traversing the cliff path, still in doubt as to what course he should take, and whether or not it would be advisable to keep the appointment. As he came in sight of the vicarage, which stood about a hundred yards from the cliff edge, he paused as though the sight of Maisie's home had given a finishing touch to the complication round which his thoughts were travelling. The safe guarding of that home was the problem he had to solve : he laid that down definitely for himself as he glanced at the wind-blown roof, w hich looked so much the worse for the storms of last winter. There might have been dreams of another kind lately, visions of flight to a distant country, of a twofold life among strangers who would know nothing and care nothing about the past of any7 young couple who might come to settle among them ; but with his new eyes he perceived the fatuity of these, and put them aside, as he thought, once for all. That small home, for all its poverty and seemingly hopeless future, yet contained some thing which no earthly combination of material enjoy7ments could give to her who should renounce"], [263, "A PARSON AT BAY. 255 it \u2014 the privilege of looking the world in the face, and laying just claim to the title of \"honest woman.\" And, for his own part, what sort of happiness could he look for in the new relation ? The vision, in its completeness, pre-supposed the drinking of some lethe-draught, and there runs no river of oblivion for him whose heart and conscience are yet alive. No \u2014 the affair must come to an abrupt end. So far, well ; but how to cut the thread safely in face of this new element in the situation, discovery? It was unlikely that Ulick Aubrey, the writer of the letter, had himself witnessed any of those meetings at the foot-bridge ; most likely some person in humble life, employed on the water or about the marshes, had been the successful spy. But, in that case, why should the report have been carried to Aubrey, rather than to the vicar, or at any rate some one intimately connected with Maisie ? The inference that the spy had been expressly employed by Aubrey seemed unavoidable ; espe cially when he reviewed Aubrey's persistent hostility to himself, his silent jealous guarding of Maisie during several months. Moreover, though he hated the man, Otis was too shrewd not to perceive how curiously and how purely Maisie's beauty had touched him. He had studied Aubrey with the curiosity of a psychologist, as well as with the close scrutiny of an enemy who had something to fear from him, and was perfectly well aware that the man's odd vein of Quixotism, though embedded in"], [264, "A PARSON AT BAY. 256 a piece of most ordinary human clay, made him really dangerous. Aubrey had peremptorily requested him to be in the old quarry on the landward slope of the headland at a certain hour this evening \u2014 and the artist was now slowly and doubtfully making his way in that direction. If he decided not to keep the appointment, what steps would his enemy take ? It might have been safe to put off some people with a vaguely soothing phrase or two, but Ulick Aubrey was one of those dogged, strike-hard men who scorn fine words, written or spoken ; and, if he had concluded, as he had almost certainly done, that Maisie was in extreme danger, he would stop at nothing to save her. Moreover, to refuse to meet him would be to confirm his worst suspicions ; and, to clinch the matter, it went dead against the grain with Otis to refuse to meet an enemy who had threatened him. He decided to keep the appoint ment ; to go through with an awkward business, come what might of it. As he quickened his pace, and took firmer hold of this decision, Otis looked wistfully over the Channel, across which heavy squalls from the land were sweeping darkly. \" Over there,\" he muttered viciously, \" where men still retain the sentiment of honour, Aubrey and I could settle our differences in a twinkling : we could quarrel over a game of cards and meet next morning like gentlemen, without her name being"], [265, "A PARSON AT BAY. 257 once mentioned in connection with the affair ; but here, in this law-ridden country, Lord knows what will come of it ! This hulking fool of a dragoon will never listen to reason ; he'll insult me till I'm half mad, and then \" After all, the decision brought with it but little relief. Otis was a cool brave man, apt with his weapon, as, in the one duel he had fought, his French antagonist had found to his cost ; but the prospect of meeting a deadly enemy7 of twice his size and weight, in a lonely quarry-pit, and with no one at hand to see fair play, was far from a pleas ing one. The danger of his situation cleared any remaining film from his eyes ; he now saw clearly that he had been playing the knave as well as the fool, and had probably done irreparable injury to the home that he was now so anxious to safe guard. He had so entangled himself that Ulick Aubrey, the spendthrift, the seducer of innocence \u2014 for Otis was now certain that Ulick was the man for whose misdeed he had himself been under suspicion \u2014 Aubrey, the black sheep of his family, had almost the right to regard him as a pernicious villain, whose punishment any man might take in hand with a clear conscience. It seemed to Otis that Nemesis was striking at him with the sneering laugh of some spiteful human foe, instead of delivering sentence with the stem calm of an avenging goddess. He was to be made ridiculous, it appeared, as well as punished. His very sur roundings heightened the aggravation. Across 17"], [266, "258 A PARSON AT BAY. the water, at least with the set he had been most thrown with in Paris, this affair would have been as a feather in his cap, or, at any rate, would have carried with it some aroma of gallantry and romance : but, here, in this rural nook of England\u2014 a country reeking of propriety and respectability \u2014 to be forced into a vulgar quarrel in a gravel-pit, to have to listen probably to coarse threats of violence \u2014 every sensitive fibre of him might well vibrate at the prospect. And whose fault had led him into this quandary ? upon whom could he expend the bitter exasperation that possessed him ? Surely upon none but him self. Nothing but his own fastidious whim, his proud shrinking from being just like other men, had prevented his winning Maisie ere ever the parson appeared on the scene ; and then no one had persuaded him to soothe his own well-earned disappointment by following her to England. Nor, after that, had there been any fettering of his freedom, any subtly- leading coquetry on Maisie's part. She had been, until lately, and after long pursuit, perfectly neutral \u2014 blind, as it seemed, to his weakness. There had been no jealous husband to titivate his vanity and spur him on to folly ; but only the simple, unsus- pecting parson, with his unconscious presentment of that very sincerity of effort and self-abandonment to duty which the artist had arrogantly declared to be an ideal preached, but never actually practised, by humankind."], [267, "A PARSON AT BAY. 259 This parson, it was true, had a faith which made virtue not only a desirable aim, but a positive necessity of existence. With this man's faith, now, would his own course have been straighter ?

Believe me, the ' Thou shalt-nots ' of philosophy are mere clay in the hands of human passion ; and those of the world are kept mainly for the poor \u2014 the rich hear them, but faintly and afar off. Without the ' Thou-shalt-not ' of the Almighty7, mortal man must fall sooner or later ; and the fall of one with conscience ancl honour, like yourself, is apt enough to end in desolation.\" Suppose, now, that ancient command, \" Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife,\" had been embedded in his brain while he was considering the question of his migration to England, stand ing, square and solid, in the way of his thoughts, and thrusting them into new channels ; might it not have altered his whole subsequent course of action ?"], [268, "260 A PARSON AT BAY. Thrown back upon himself by stress of circum stances, Otis went labouring round such old mill tracks as the above during his walk towards the headland ; but, as he neared his goal, the business that was actually before him swept his mind clear of all such speculations. He had to turn aside down the grassy7 upper slope of the headland, pass through a broad belt of gorse, then plunge downward through heather and brambles to where the old gravel-pit yawned above the level spread of the marsh lands. It was the loneliest spot in a lonely district \u2014 apart as well from the cliff path as from that which led through the low ground lying between village and quay ; surrounded, too, on three sides by thick bushes. No better spot could have been chosen for a secret meetinc;. \" It is a place fit for a murder,\" muttered Otis, as he strode down the hill waist-deep in gorse and heather, with the river mists rising before him, and the gathering dusk settling like a dun pall upon the long ridge at his back. The solitude oppressed him, adding its weight to his existing burden of painful anticipation ; as he got deeper into the brambly wilderness, he could no longer stave off the admission that his nerves were growing unsteady7. To one accustomed to find his coinage always ready to answer to a call, this was an embittering discovery. He felt scared \u2014 almost frightened ; a coward's longing to turn back instead of plunging into the gruesome hollow that was now so near, took"], [269, "A PARSON AT BAY. 261 hold of his mind and will. He raged at himself, yet still the unaccountable yearning towards the hill-top plucked at him like a strong sinewy hand. It was not surprising that a sensitive impressible artist should be thus worked upon by gloomy surroundings, but the fact of finding himself thus shaken, of knowing that his cheek was pale, his breathing short, was an anguish to him. It is hard for a proud man to realize that he is mortal, and \" subject to all the skiey influences.\" But Otis did not once stop in his course ; he could at least prove himself the possessor of that kind of courage which, though lacking the glitter of true romantic heroism, is a fine triumph of human will \u2014 the powrer, not of slaying Fear, but of disregarding its imperative commands, and scorning its might. Fear strode at his side, but was powerless to check him ; and so he came in due course to the marge of the pit, and, working round it to the only opening in the bushes \u2014 which lay at the lower side, where the drop was but a few feet, \u2014 found the gravelly hollow exposed to his gaze. At that moment, with an odd creeping of the skin, and a quick rush of blood to the face, his courage returned to him \u2014 he found himself confronted no longer by vague ghost like fears, but a living human foe. Ulick Aubrey was leaning his large frame tranquilly against the gravelly wall of the quarry ; his arms were folded; his attitude betokened that of a man who has taken his line \u2014 a definite and decisive one \u2014 and is satisfied with it. There was"], [270, "262 A PARSON AT BAY. no hint of coarse threatening or brawling to come, and under his arm, as though to complete and emphasize this promise of gentlemanlike foemanship, was a wooden box which the artist recognized at once as a pistol-case."], [271, "A PARSON AT BAY. 263 CHAPTER XIX. \" Unjust offences may for a time escape without danger, but never without revenge.\" \u2014 Eobert Greene. \\WM\\ HE reader will doubtless have guessed that wg.wll Aubrey had at length run down his quarry through no very subtle stratagem or deeply wrought scheme of his own. After the night of his rejection by Miss Otis, when his slumbering suspicions of her brother had been aroused to sudden fresh activity, he had given his mind to the question of how to set an efficient watch upon the dangerous American ; but at first without achieving anything like a plan of campaign. He had not, indeed, the smallest gift of scheming, as was shown by his reckless fashion of plunging into difficulties which a shrewder, or even a meaner, worldling than himself would easily have steered clear of; and so, when confronted by so difficult a problem as that of out rnancevring a man twice as clever as himself, Ulick had been thoroughly nonplussed. Nor, until his chance meeting with Nan Keylock by the seashore, had he been able to evolve any suitable plan for getting even with his man ; ancl then it was Nan's wit, not his own, that settled the difficulty."], [272, "264 A PARSON AT BAY. The meeting had been a sad one for Ulick. There was nothing of the heartless libertine about him ; he was at worst no more than a reckless, hot-headed, go-as-you-please kind of rake \u2014 one of those whom people pronounce, with simple-hearted fatuity, to be no one's enemy but their own ; and, in truth, he had never known a blacker moment than that which made him for the first time aware of Nan's trouble and her father's. Nan was in some measure comforted by his outburst of sorrow, but felt that, whatever he might say, he could do nothing to help them. His regret was poignant enough at the moment, but there remained the stubborn fact that she and her father must bear the shame alone. Ulick, she thought, woidd be more dissipated and reckless for a time, but it was part of the inevitable ness of things that she, the one sinned against, should bear the sinner's just punishment as well as her own. The interview- was a long one, and was followed by others, with the chief issue of which, however, we are not concerned at this moment ; suffice it that, as soon as Xan was informed of his difficulty7, she herself readily undertook the task of keeping a strict watch upon Otis whenever he should come down the river, his most convenient line of approach to the neighbourhood of the vicarage. Her own bedi'oom window commanded the river right up to Marsh bridge, ancl at dusk she could creep about the creeks and reed-beds in her own punt. She promised to be a most efficient watchdog."], [273, "A PARSON AT BAY. 265 Moreover, Nan's jealous hatred of the woman who had so strong an influence over him would, as was patent even to Aubrey's simplicity, give a special zest to the work that she was undertaking ; her bitter desire to catch Maisie tripping, and so to disillusion him completely, would insure a tireless activity on the part of his spy. And her thorough knowledge of the waters and marshes, and habits of prowling about after sunset, would all be in her favour. The event, as we have seen, had justified these expectations. Buried deep in reedy creeks, Nan had watched the path over the marshes evening after evening, faithfully reporting whatever she saw ; only, unhappily, the jealousy which had sharpened her skill in watching had also pricked her on to a too hasty conclusion. Her last report \u2014 and she fully believed it a true one \u2014 was to the effect that the American had definitely made up his mind to go off with the parson's wife. The meetings had become more frequent : he had bought one of the Bavant sailing-boats, and was constantly exploring in it the harbour channel and the rocky bay outside ; and there was every reason to believe that he meant to put the knowledge so acquired to some special use. He could, while cruising along the coast in fair weather, easily send his punt ashore to pick up the lady at any point of the bay. An hour's fair sailing would then suffice to land them at Kimmersham, whence the railway would take them whithersoever they pleased. Nothing could be easier than to"], [274, "A PARSON AT BAY. 266 safely manage an elopement in this way : there would not be a soul to hinder them, and it might be half a clay before their flight was discovered. All this was, as we know, somewhat premature ; yet the intentions of one about whose mind guilty possibilities are hovering are sometimes less patent to himself than to others, and these man\u0153uvrings of the artist's may have been the issue of underlying thoughts which, under some specious clothing or other, were affecting him without his own clear knowledge. Nor was he so constituted as to face the probability of a crudely guilty issue, until self committal to the same became inevitable. Aubrey, at any rate, fully accepted Nan's view of the case, and his letter had followed immediately upon that last report of hers. But before we are in a position to understand clearly7 what took place at the quarry, it is necessary to take a brief glance at another factor in the situa tion \u2014 one unknown as yet to any of the four other persons concerned. The watcher had been watched, there was a fifth possessor of the secret \u2014 to wit, Nan's father. Old Keylock and his daughter had latterly been living separate lives under one roof, sitting at the same table, passing many hours in the same room, but hardly ever exchanging a word. Whether the old man had given up the quest as hopeless, or whether his hope of revenge had been worn out by long brooding, Nan could not tell. Her father's mind was dark to her, his heart made no response"], [275, "A PARSON AT BAY. 267 to her mute appeals ; the pride of his hale strong old age seemed to have passed, together with his pride in her, and with all the other feelings and desires that had made up his once strenuous personality. The apathy which had come over the old man had a more blighting effect upon Nan than any fiercer form of grief could have done. He seemed to have no feeling towards her, one way or the other ; she was no more than a puppet to him, the medium through which his pride had been struck low. She felt numbed by the stony glance that never altered, ancl once only did she find courage to make the passionate appeal which was always forming itself in her mind. That was on the morning of her meeting with Ulick Aubrey, ancl all the gathered passion of that appeal, breaking like a sudden storm upon the old man, had moved him no more than wind and spray move rock. Nan had gone forth, shattered by her own futile passion, to be met by Ulick on the seashore just as reaction had brought extreme weakness. Later on a change came ; some new atmosphere enveloped Nan, a new spring of life marked all her movements. Her father, whose heart was yet alive, though the machinery of its expression had ceased working, wondered at the change. When, after a time, she asked leave to pay a visit to some relations at Hy7the, on Southampton Water, he was the more amazed ; but he asked no questions, put forward no"], [276, "268 A PARSON AT BAY. objections. She was free to go or to come as she pleased. After that visit, however, there was a change in the old man also, though outwardly he remained the same. The apathy7, which had been real, was now retained only as a mask to cover his close scrutiny of Nan's movements. She was so far lulled into security that he was enabled to follow her, unseen, in many of her twilight excursions ; and the discovery that she was spying upon the American brought with it a fresh impulse of hope and energy7. It was, in fact, the belief, growing to a certainty in spite of his intense desire to the contrary7, that Ulick Aubrey was his true victim, which had so dried up his faculties. His old affection for Aubrey7 had left a deposit of which he could not altogether rid his mind, and which seemed to check the outflow of his hatred ; yet his thoughts would never turn to any minor vengeance \u2014 he must either kill the man who had injured him so grievously, or hold his hand altogether. Nor was there any softening pity for Nan to humanize him ; his old stern prideful affection for his handsome lass had, seemingly, been crashed out by a weightier passion. The knowledge that her secret was now no secret, that his neigh bours ancl kinsfolk, who feared to come near him, were discussing his misfortune on the other side of the narrow channel, worked in him like a poison. He yearned to strike, but could not quite bring himself to strike \"Master Ulick.\""], [277, "A PARSON AT BAY. 269 This last discovery, however, opened a new vista, ancl gave a new edge to his purpose, a new sweetness to a revenge that had well-nigh lost its savour. Nan was secretly watching the American's meetings with another woman \u2014 what motive could she have but jealousy ? Let her continue to play the spy for a time, sooner or later her self-control would give out; she would confront ancl fall upon the traitor, and then her denunciation should be followed by a swifter sentence than she dreamed of. This afternoon the old man had noticed that she was especially agitated. As the evening drew on she could hardly contain her anxiety. He remained passive and silent as usual, and made for his post on the Head at his usual hour, knowing well that she would herself start as soon as she had watched him out of sight. Afterwards, he would creep down through the heather to a small knoll just below the quarry, whence he had lately been observing all that passed on the marsh. He carried out the plan which had served him so often during the last few weeks ; but, though he watched long and intently, there was this time no sign of life on or about the marshes. Soon after sunset he had been wont to see Nan's punt creeping about the creeks, presently to disappear in some deep reed-patch ; soon after which the American would come slowdy paddling down the river without apparent precaution, rowing to and fro in an objectless fashion for a time, and then suddenly disappearing as Nan had done."], [278, "270 A PARSON AT BAY. To-night the surface of the water was unbroken by any splash of oar, and the movements of certain wildfowl were, to the old man's trained instinct, sufficient proof that no human creature was loitering among the reedy thickets. The whole reach of the river was lashed by hardening squalls from the north-east, the crisp reed-stems swayed and rustled beneath the wind buffets as the sun sank, sending forth a fierce gush of orange light just before it clipped behind a cloud-bank. \" More wind comin', \" muttered the watcher, \u2014 \" too rough a night for 'em to meet, I reckon ; but where can Nan have got to ? \" He had not to wait more than a moment or two for an answer to the question. As he lay prone among the thick heather, keeping a steadfast watch upon marsh and river, he heard a rustling sound behind him, and, craning his head cautiously round, became aware that some one was makin ir his or her O way through the brambles near the lip of the gravel pit. He listened with thickening pulses, and succeeded, after a moment or two, in locating the sound more precisely. Then, staring eagerly through the dusk, he perceived Nan's figure, dun-mantled like her surroundings, emerge suddenly7, and as suddenly subside again into the bushy screen at the quarry edge. He waited in strained expectancy, but she moved no more. \" Watching some one below, is she ? \" he whispered, moistening his dry lips. \" Who the devil can be down in that hole ? \""], [279, "A PARSON AT BAY. 271 Presently a sharp snap of sound came from the dusky opening; Aubrey had struck a match, and was lighting a cigarette. He had no more suspicion of Nan's proximity than of Old Keylock's. Upon receiving her report he had made light of it, on purpose to avoid alarming her ; but his poor acting, so far from deceiving Nan, had given the spur to a fear that was always present with her. She had noticed the one brief glance he threw towards the quarry whilst talking to her last night, and in a flash of intuition guessed that he was thinking of it as a likely place in which to meet the American. Later on she had asked him carelessly what chance there would be of meeting him again next evening at the same hour, and his immediate assertion, that he would be engaged at a distance, told her at once what she wanted to know. Her eyes were yearning upon him now, as he stood silently awaiting his adversary. The old man could not see his daughter, though he knew the precise position of her hiding-place. The situation was a complete puzzle, to which such incoherent guessings as chased each other through his mind offered no key ; but every quiver ing nerve of him spoke to his belief that the longed-for crisis was at hand, that the right victim was either below in the pit or expected every moment. Great drops of sweat fell from his fore head ; the fingers which grasped the lean cold barrel at his side were moist and trembling. But his will was firm set, as he knew it would be when"], [280, "272 A PARSON AT BAY. the time came \u2014 as it had been when, on such a night as this, five and twenty years ago, he drew trigger on the treacherous coast guardsman. Had Otis known, as he made his way down the slope, that this deadly foe lay stretched here in ambush, convinced of his guilt and ready to blow the soul out of his body, his conception of himself, as the plaything of an ironically smiling Nemesis, would have taken a different colour. The face of this man, who was thinking neither of heathen goddesses, nor of the God who made him, looked as though it had never smiled ; the grey twilight fell upon fierce straining eyes and a forehead ridged with passion. The American became visible to neither watcher until he stood upon the upper edge of the quarry7. They saw him then, as he hesitated for a second or two before skirting round the brink to the lower side. As he leaped down the bank a rattle of falling gravel broke the tense silence which reigned be tween the wind blasts. The old man dragged himself slowly forward, keeping his eyes just above the level of the heather, never taking them off the low bush-clump in which he knew Nan to be concealed. When about twenty yards short of the bush, he paused again. Two men's voices were audible from the pit : they were not raised in anger, nor were the words distinguishable, but the sound had a peculiar arresting quality \u2014 the deep impressive ring which finds its way into human speech when it is about"], [281, "A PARSON AT BAY. 273 to merge into action. \" They're goin' to fight ! \" muttered the old man, amazedly. What followed happened in a flash, yet to Otis each second of the few pregnant moments was distinct ancl separate, with an emotion of its own that no passage of time could blurr. The tense feelings that lived through but a single heart-throb were scarred in upon his consciousness, as though by separate pricks of sharp steel. For one long moment he was facing his foe, pistol in hand, with no thought beyond the primitive savage instinct of killing the man who meant to kill him ; with every fibre of his will stretched in the endeavour to save himself ; with no sense of past or future, but only of the crushing grinding present, with its firm clutch of his every faculty. Then there was a crash among the overhanging bushes, the fall of a heavy body down the low bank, the upward spring of a fallen form \u2014 and in a moment a dark figure had thrown itself upon his opponent, and was covering the target at which his pistol was levelled. Aubrey staggered back with the girl clinging round his neck. Then, even as Otis lowered his pistol hand, there was an outleap of flame from the lip of the chasm, ancl a deafening report, and he saw the interlaced figures fall as though welded into one by the death-shot. Then there were blurred moments ; his knees shook under him, and he could see nothing. He was lying :prone upon the floor of the gravel-pit when he awoke to consciousness, and Old Keylock IS"], [282, "274 A PARSON AT BAY. was striding past him with the lust of revenge still burning in his ey7es. The old man stooped low- over his victims, then turned and mechanically thrust another cartridge into the breach of his rifle, whispering hoarsely \u2014 \" My turn now ! \" \" Stop \u2014 I saw her hand move.\" Otis thought to speak loudly, but the words came in a husky murmur. The girl's body had rolled apart from the man's, and she was still breathing. The fingers of one hand were clutching feebly at the collar of her dress. Otis reached her side in a few unsteady steps, and, as he stooped over her, a rush of hot tears came to his eyes, whether from pity7 or revulsion of feeling he could not tell. As he raised her head to place it on his knee, ancl loosened her dress, a paper slipped out and fell to the ground unnoticed. Then for a few seconds the girl's dark lashes fluttered, and there was a faint movement of her hands towards the dead man beside her. But no sound came from her lips ; and even as he bent his ear to catch any last whisper they might breathe, the feeble breath passed, and the poor flutter of life died out. Otis laid her clown pitifully, and turned to look at her destroyer. The old man was leaning, motionless, against a block of gravel. His passion had passed with his daughter's life. His face was now ashen in"], [283, "A PARSON AT BAY. 275 hue ; the first chill of remorse was creeping into his heart. The artist, now felt strong ancl capable. The horror of what he had witnessed still oppressed him heavily, but beneath it lay the subtle heart warmth of escape from danger. Life was sweet, and he was safe : he would not dwell upon the thought, yet it was helping to revive him. He took possession of the rifle which lay on the ground beside the old man, and placed it out of his reach. Then, finding that Keylock neither moved nor spoke, nor seemed to notice the removal of his weapon, he knelt to examine with a sudden piti fulness the lifeless Thing which a moment since had been a living foe. Ulick Aubrey was stone dead. His end seemed to have been instantaneous and painless. The body lay on its back ; the pistol, by the shock of its fall, had been hurled to some little distance. Otis laid his handkerchief over the dead face. This man had always been his enemy \u2014 an open honest enemy, whose hostility did him no dishonour. The artist felt a thrill of gratitude to \u2014 some vague Power or other \u2014 for permitting the man to fall by a hand other than his. In turning again to the dead girl, he noticed the fallen paper, and struck a match with a view to examining it. After a second or two he uttered so sharp an exclamation of surprise that the old man looked up involuntarily."], [284, "276 A PARSON AT BAY. \" Good God, Keylock,\" he cried amazedly, \" this is a marriage certificate \u2014 you have killed a husband and wife ! \" The old man leaned forward half-comprehendingly, and passed his hand vaguely across his forehead. \" Do you hear ? They were married at South ampton three weeks ago. I begin to see how it has all come about. It has been rumoured that he intended to colonize, to go off quietly as soon as his brother could be brought round. He meant to take his wife with him, keeping the secret of his marriage, doubtless, for the sake of his people, until they were safe out of the country. See, the poor thing's wedding-ring is fastened round her neck by this bit of silk. Keylock, that's the worst shot you ever fired \u2014 though God knows I've no right to preach to you. Do yrou understand what I am saying ? \" Yes, the old man understood him now, the iron was entering his soul. As he tried to rise, he fell back with a moan which shook the heart of the man who was watching him. \" I can't stay with y7ou : I'm going now,\" muttered Otis, in a harsh undertone. \" I \u2014 I am sorry for you. I must go to the Quay \u2014 to the nearest habitation \u2014 ancl get help. Y'ou must give yrourself up to justice unless I shall leave y7ou the rifle \u2014 yes, I shall leave it,\" he repeated ; adding, to himself, \" Who am I to judge the right and wrong of the case ? \" Otis meant to close his ears, ancl to look no more ;"], [285, "A PARSON AT BAY. 277 but after climbing the bank a terrible fascination held him, and he looked back, listening intently. The stern old man was lying in a huddled heap beside the still dark form of his daughter, and the voice of his low groaning seemed to fill the darkness of the hollow. \"Vengeance is Mine, saith the Lord \" \u2014 thrice the muttered words came up to the straining listener before he tore himself away and fled towards the sandhills."], [286, "A PARSON AT BAY. 278 CHAPTER XX. \" Omnes eodem cogimur ; omnium Versatur urna serius ocius Sors exitura, et nos in \u00e6ternum Exsilium impositura cymb\u0153.' Horace, \u00a7||j1T.UTYIXG at the Black House\u2014 the empty asi-lil shell of what had once been a home \u2014 Otis uttered a sigh of satisfaction at finding himself greeted by the twinkling lights on the Quay ; then, pausing but a moment for breath, he sent a lusty shout across the narrow tide-channel, and was further relieved by hearing it answered imme diately. Indeed the \" Hullo \" which came back so promptly set his nerves tingling pleasantly, helping to drown that anguished cry of the old man which still rang in his brain, and to dissipate the miserable sense of loneliness that possessed him. Any human talk would be welcome to him just now, and the hearth-blaze of the meanest shanty on the Quay would have attractions for this fastidious artist, who ordinarily shunned squalor as one of the worst forms of ugliness. His heart was so low, his whole system so much shaken by what he had gone through, that"], [287, "A PARSON AT BAY. 279 nothing having the least spice of human fellowship about it could come amiss to him. Even the voice of the youthful Culmer who rowed across to fetch him, greeting him in simple Quay fashion with the question, \" What the devil be you shoutin' for, ay ? \" was welcome as that of a friend. In a short space of time \u2014 startlingly short it seemed to the bewildered artist \u25a0 \u2014 the whole Keylock-Culmer colony was gathered round him on the open space in front of the Sheet Anchor. The shout from Old Keylock's side of the water had, in fact, startled the whole colony, for no signal had come over from the Black House for many a long day. They had been furtively watching the house, gazing through dingy windows at the old man's goings and comings ; talking in whispers about his trouble ; looking for a crisis, yet hardly daring to shape their fears and expectations in definite words. The old wholesome dread of the Chief who had kept them in some sort of order \u2014 only allowing the youngsters to break such parts of the law of the land as were obnoxious to his own feelings \u2014 had latterly been replaced by a kind of superstitious terror of the broken old fellow. Some mischief would come of his half-crazed condition : any night almost they might expect to hear Nan's shriek, or the splash of the old man's body as it fell into the tide-way. \" 'Twill be either her, or himself, look ; one or t'other's bound to go to Kingdom Come afore the next spring tides \" \u2014 such was the impression that"], [288, "280 A PARSON AT BAY. prevailed through every rickety old house on the Quay. \" What be wrong yonder, mister ? \" asked half a dozen voices the moment he clambered up the woodwork, and came under the glare of light which streamed from the Anchor's open door. \" Is there summat amiss with the old man ? \" The sound of the shot, so far to leeward of them, had not reached the Quay, and the usual single light was still burning in the Black House ; none knew what had happened, or even that Old Keylock was away7 from home. It was a rough and shaggy gang that surrounded Otis. Unkempt women were pressing in between hulking bearded fellows, who thrust them aside with curse or cuff, and behind these a crowd of ragged urchins skirmished and squabbled. The gush of dirty yellow light from the inn lighted up most of the figures, while upon the spars and rusty anchors, and all the litter of ropes and lobster-pots in the background, fell pure white gleams from the moon, as ever and anon the flying scud left her bare. From the fierce squalls that came out of the north-east the buildings sheltered them, and the dark channel at their feet ran sound less. The wind being off-shore, there was no crash of near surf to speak to its weight and strength ; even on the bar, over which the gusts were hurtling darkly, there was little sea ; no white water showed anywhere save on the reef outside, upon which the long slow swells were grinding savagely."], [289, "A PARSON AT BAY. 281 A dead silence fell upon the fisher-colony when they heard what Old Keylock had done, and how he had been left in the pit alone with the bodies of his two victims. Otis scanned the faces nearest him, but could make nothing of them. Would they give him up to justice if they found him alive ? or make futile attempts to aid his escape ? He could not tell. They seemed stunned by what had befallen. At length one old greybeard, an ancient comrade of Keylock's, muttered, half to himself \u2014 \" Captain Aubrey dead, you say ? Be you sure that Jeth Keylock has wiped out the right man, mister ? \" Then Otis perceived in a flash that Keylock's suspicion of himself had found an echo among the friends and kinsfolk on this side of the water ; and a sudden indefinable movement in the throng sug gested that things might go ill with him if the suspicion were allowed to deepen. If this rough crew, with whom Aubrey had always been popular, were allowed to assume that he had been done to death for the delinquency of another, it might be very bad for that other. Were they to press upon him now, a single thrust of the hand, accidental or other, would send him over the Quay edge into the strong smooth rush of the ebb \u2014 a horrible thought to one who was not a swimmer. He must clear himself at once and decisively. \"I tell you Keylock shot them together,\" he retorted quickly, turning to face his questioners."], [290, "282 A PARSON AT BAY. \" The girl was in Captain Aubrey's arms ; they fell together as one. Whether or not he intended to shoot them both, I don't know, and probably no one ever will know.\" \" And what was you after in the gravel -pit yourself, sir, if a man may arst ? \" This question was put by another voice, and rammed home by the corroborative murmurs of several more. \" I met Captain Aubrey in the quarry by appoint ment. We were \u2014 standing near each other, when Keylock's daughter broke suddenly7 from the bushes, half fell clown the bank, and, rushing upon Aubrey, was shot as I have told you.\" \" 'Twas a queer kind o' hole for! you and Cappen Aubrey to be colloguing in arter sundown, warn't it, mister ? \" The greybeard, having advanced a step or two, was now the admitted spokesman of the group. Otis went suddenly7 pale ; a new fear had sprung up to confront him. With the pressure of the witnessed tragedy lying heavily upon his mind, the probability of such a cross-questioning as this had not once occurred to him. He had been prudent enough to throw the pistols ancl their case into one qf the creeks across which he plunged in his flight from the quarry7, but the action had been almost mechanical ; his mind being concentrated upon Keylock ancl his victims, the difficulty7 of explain ing his presence on the spot had not presented itself until this moment."], [291, "A PARSON AT BAY. 283 Unhappily he had now made, in the hearing of the entire colony, an admission that contained ruinous possibilities. The least atom of foresight would have saved it ; he could easily, had a single calm moment come to him, have made up a story colourable enough to pass muster. Now it might be too late ; to-morrow the neighbourhood would be ringing with the affair, ancl every group of gossips would but too probably be discussing his extra ordinary meeting with Captain Aubrey, and making guesses as to its cause. He shuddered to think how Maisie's reputation now hung upon a thread. For the present, however, Otis was to have no opportunity of retrieving his blunder, or, on the other hand, of deepening the impression of it by over-hasty7 explanations. He ceased on a sudden to be the centre of the rough throng's interest ; they all rushed to the Quay edge, straining their eyres, with muttered exclamations, up the harbour. In one of the flying gleams some one had descried a dark blot on the wa,ter, which he at once guessed to be Old Keylock's dinghy drifting down on the ebb \u2014 whether tenanted or not the next gleam would decide. They waited in breathless silence while the flying cloud-rack thickened, and the wind lashed the lancl-locked water into a miniature sea. The upper reaches of the estuary, with their encircling reed beds, had disappeared again ; only the nearer sandhills made a pale gleam in the blackness. After a brief pause the moon leaped clear again"], [292, "A PARSON AT BAY. 284 into a belt of brightness, when the dark blot stood forth, plain to the eye of every eager gazer. On the thwart was a bent figure, and the sculls seemed to dip now and then with but just force enough to keep the boat's head straight. But the speck, swept along by7 the strong tide, was enlarging rapidly, and ere long would be abreast of the Quay7. They7 would then see in what fashion the old man was minded to make his final exit from among them ; for none doubted that the closing scene of his life was about to be enacted. The drifting boat did not again disappear, but came sweeping on with every pair of eyes on the Quay fast bound to it. As it continued stem-on to them they could not tell what the after part of the dinghy might contain, yet the figure that actually lay7 there was in the mind's eye of every gazer. At length, on nearing the spot, just above the Black House, where was moored the yawl which for years the old man had used as a pleasure craft, and in which Master Ulick had taken so many cruises with him, the sculler's bent figure was straightened, and his head turned as though to calculate his distance. This was done to a nicety, and the little cockle shell, brought round in a sweeping curve so as to stem the tide-rush, came quietly7 alongside the larger craft ; in doing which she exposed her burden to the whole group of watchers. Nan had the look of a sleeping woman, rather than of a dead one. The dark drapery was"], [293, "A PARSON AT BAY. 285 carefully arranged in the bottom of the dinghy. The moonlight faded at the moment of their catching sight of her, like a voice hushing itself in reve rence ; ancl the pale face, half hidden by loosened hair, was but faintly visible. It was a poet's dream of death that met their eyes, rather than death's stern reality ; with no hint of terror, no suggestion of past violence. There was no sound from the onlookers until the old man stooped and lifted his daughter gently into the stern sheets of the y7awl, when a low sobbing became audible among the women. The men, held hard by emotion, stood fixed and motionless as the piles that supported them ; even Otis was half dazed by the profound interest of the silent living drama that was being played out before his eyes. What would be the old man's next move ? They were not left long in doubt. Without once looking up to the row of pallid faces above him, he began methodically7, with machine-like regularity, to make preparations for getting the yawl under way. The dead girl was now hidden by the high coamings of the cockpit ; but the concentration of every gaze upon himself seemed to affect the old man no more than a child's idle stare would have done. He proceeded to unstop the mainsail, ship the tiller, and hoist away upon the halliards, neither hurrying nor resting. \"Goin' to sea, mates \u2014 for the last time,\" mur mured Keylock's old comrade ; and a deep breath, like a sigh, was all that the others cared to add."], [294, "286 A PARSON AT BAY. \" Never a reef neither ; whole mainsail and big jib\u2014 he's like enough to show his keel to the sky7 first squall that hits him t'other side o' the bar,\" continued the only speaker, in a low growling monotone. Old Keylock was moving to and fro, as has been said, with the steadiness of a machine \u2014 but a machine deprived of its motive power, and slowly running down as the small store of its remaining energy exhausts itself. After purchasing up the throat of the heavy mainsail, he leaned against the mast, swaying as though about to fall upon the deck. But the strong will again laid its grip upon the fainting frame, and the skill and judgment born of prolonged habit were ready to back it. He executed without a fault the difficult man\u0153uvre of getting under way from an awkward berth, with the wind coming in fierce narrow puffs between the houses ; slipped his mooring at precisely7 the right moment, and reached down the channel beneath them, standing at the helm with his white head bare to the night. Under the last group of houses he was for a second or two becalmed ; but just beyond them the ground fell, and the hard north-easter, coming over the low neck of land that joined mainland and Quay, struck the little craft so shrewd a buffet, that for a moment she was down on her beam ends. Many thought the end had come, but it was not so. The smitten boat recovered, and with the cale now on her quarter, ancl the full sweep of the ebb"], [295, "A PARSON AT BAY. 287 beneath her, ramped down the narrow seaward channel with a wake of hissing foam. There being no sea on the bar, Keydock was now certain to fetch into open water; and, thereafter, they thought to see him hold on, unless blown over by a squall, right away into the open Channel, until his sail became a speck in the moonlight. The greybeard, however, who seemed to know by instinct what was passing in his old shijimate's mind, said quietly7, as the yawl flashed past the last buoy \u2014 \" He'll gybe her as soon as he gets a lull, ancl head for the reef y7onder.\" This was what actually occurred. In the first brief lull the helmsman, whose hand nothing could rob of its cunning, wore the little ship deftly round, and put her across the bay on the star board tack, pressed down to the gunwale and drenched from stem to stern in sheets of spray. \" Makin' for the passage, d'ye think ? \" whispered a woman, glancing hopefully at the old man ; but the latter only shook his head\u2014 and once more he proved a true prophet. In the now brilliant moonlight they could see every pitch and send of the flying boat. After the gybe she had at first been headed for the narrow opening, and they soon perceived the reason for this. For, when abreast of the higher part of the reef where the turmoil of broken water was fiercest, Keylock bore away suddenly, bringing the wind right aft, and his course square on to the rocks."], [296, "A PARSON AT BAY. 288 There was no longer any doubt that he meant to crash stem on to the reef, and find his grave in its boiling surf. Nor could the end be delayed more than a few minutes, with the hard firm gale, now that she was clear away7 from the land-shelter, driving the doomed boat with her heavy7 press of canvas like a straw before it. Minutes ? surely7 rather seconds ; the little craft was leaping over the long smooth swells like a hunted thing. Otis felt an odd swelling of the heart as he watched this fierce rush into the embrace of Death : there was a wild intoxication about it that was robbing Death, not only of his terrors, but of all the appurtenances of pain that he loves so well, and knows so well how to use. Where were the sorrow and anguish that belong to him of right \u2014 the long nights of weariness, the final quiver of the enfeebled body as the wrung soul gives up its last faint hope ? The old smuggler was stripping him of all his privileges, grappling hand-to-hand with Death, forcing him to strike once and strike home, like an honest foe, \u2014 better still, robbing man of his cruel rights. No justice; no trial; no return to the prison cell with the fatal words ringing in the brain ; no ghastly stepping forth into the prison yard by the light of a last morning, but only the cleaving rush of the sharp-stemmed boat, the quick keen sting of flying spray, and \u2014 yes, it had come ! With a wild bound the driven craft had hurled herself upon the reef, smashing her bows to"], [297, "A PARSON AT BAY. 289 matchwood. For a second she was visible, mastless and sailless, lying broadside on to the rocks, then she was rolled over and over, crushed ancl buried by a roaring surge, with nothing but a welter of curdling foam to mark her grave. 19"], [298, "A PARSON AT BAY. 290 CHAPTER XXI. \" Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.\" Shakspeee. jjTjEB OME within reach o' my boot toe, and I'll s-ga-ll kick the life out o' your cowardly shakin' carcase, you sneaking cur ! \" This being Bob Keylock's fashion of greeting a friend \u2014 for Phil's dog Smutch was a friend in a way, though Bob's liking for him was at best but precarious \u2014 it might be inferred that Parson Brockenhart's factotum was in a bad temper this afternoon. Bob was seated on the edge of the pump-trough, which stood over against the stable wall, smokino- O ' o a dirty clay7 pipe, ancl looking down over the village to where the Widgeon lay at her mooring on the broad bosom of the estuary. Now and then he turned his gaze eastwards towards the Quay, and the harbour over which his uncle's y7awl had scudded on her last voyage four weeks ago. He only took his pipe out of his mouth to expectorate or to swear, and generally did both with some heartiness before putting it in again."], [299, "A PARSON AT BAY. 291 As he gripped the clay stem tightly, the odd curve in Bob's mouth, which, in conjunction with his little cocked-up nose, gave a lurking humour to his face, became more conspicuous. But his thoughts had no tincture of humour to-day. Even his normal impudence was in abeyance, he was too sick-hearted to be flippant with any one. He could be abusive, as Smutch discovered the moment he put his black nose through the shrubbery gate, but to throw hard words at a dog is a poor solace to a man who has reason to think highly of his vitupera tive powers. It is true, Bob had freely indulged himself this afternoon at the expense of Collins, Lady Wroughton's groom-coachman; but that was an hour ago, ancl Collins was at best but a poor creature, modest and timid, ready with soft answers, a milksop round wiiom the lash of a man's wrath curled without evoking a retort of pith enough even to draw a woman's tears. You might as well hope to win ease of mind by thrashing a sheep as by giving the rough of your tongue to this mouse hearted Collins. Moreover, Collins was by now pretty well case hardened. He knew how to take the parson's man ; had learned that the meek acceptance of obloquy, which was his natural mode of self-defence, was just the most punishing treatment that could possibly be meted out to his tormentor. It was, in fact, two whole months since Lady Wroughton had first hired him to drive the bay horse and victoria for which"], [300, "292 A PARSON AT BAY. she sent to town soon after her return to the vicarage. He was well paid, and had creditably performed his duties, which consisted of driving out my dady ancl Miss Charmian, relieving the ennui of my lady's maid by occasional modest flirtation, and that of Bob by supporting his sarcasm and abuse while about the stable. But for Bob's minis trations, he would have found the place an easy one. On this occasion, however, Collins was not avail able as a butt, for he had been sent into Bavant to make some purchases for his mistress, and would be pottering about the shops for some hours ; and so Bob had to find some other distraction for his melancholy, and rather wished he had not driven Smutch away so peremptorily. There were garden tools leaning against the stable o o o wall, but Bob had no heart for work. He eyed the tools rather sadly, for he found gardening more tolerable thaii any other kind of work on land, and in a few days' time was to bid a long farewell to it. He was, in fact, to leave the parson's service on Thursday next ; and somehow or other he found himself unwilling to handle spade under any other master. He had always liked Mr. Brockenhart, and latterly, since trouble had come to the vicarage, had condescended so far as to show his liking, to encourage and hearten his drooping master in all the small ways that were ojien to him. It had always been pleasant, when digging or weeding of a summer evening, to have the parson sauntering forth from the study, book in hand and"], [301, "A PARSON AT BAY. 293 lost in abstraction, but always ready with his \" Er, well, Robert, how are the \u2014 er \u2014 what-d'ye-call-'ems getting on ? We want a little more rain, I suppose, don't we ? \" The vicar never knew what was in season, or how things grew ; the culture of a cabbage or lettuce was to him as deep a mystery as the handling of a ship under sail. Had Bob offered to cut asparagus at Christmas time he would probably have answered readily, \" All right, Robert ; cut anything that's ready.\" But ignorance may be a very attractive quality. Bob, liking well to play7 the instructor, had ere now planted many7 good seeds of practical knowledge in his master's mind, though the rank growth of philo sophical speculation, which held possession of that good ground, was apt to choke any practical seedling all too quickly. Well, instructor and pupil were now about to part for good ; there would be no more seed-planting in future. Nor, indeed, had there been any for some considerable time ; for the parson's abstraction had of late been of a deeper and blacker kind than any induced by Kant or Schopenhauer. He would emerge from the study, as of old, to have a friendly word with Robert ; but nothing ever came of the talk, and, when he sauntered listlessly back again, Bob would mutter, with an angry drive of his spade into the soil, \" Ay, Parson Brokenheart, I've heard you called here and there, and I'm afeard the name fits like a glove ! \""], [302, "294 A PARSON AT BAY. Bob's thoughts turned naturally from the tools by the stable wall to the master in whose service he had wielded them so long. \" 'Tis that cursed woman that has broke him,\" he muttered ; \" but for her, things would have come right sooner or later.\" Then he swore at large for some two or three minutes ; then rapped his pipe so smartly7 upon the stone trough as to smash it to pieces, which called for further indulgence of the tongue. \" Hows'ever,\" he concluded, glancing at his watch, \" cussin's a sort of comfort, but it don't kill time much. There's more'n an hour yet afore I can get alongside the enemy, and so Ah, there's Mr. Phil at last ! \" Phil was, in fact, just emerging from the shrub bery, and was evidently fresh from the road. He carried a Gladstone bag, walked wearily, and was covered with dust. He had been away at Kimmer sham for a fortnight, ancl had just walked the five miles from Bavant station. '\u2022 Give me a draught from the pump, Bob,\" he said, lounging slowly forward. \" I'm too dry even to smoke ; ancl I don't care to go into the house until I've had a pipe and heard the news. How's your master ? \" Robert, answering only by a touch of his cap, began to pump into a glass which he fetched from the saddle-room. \" Got your flask handy, sir ? \" he asked abruptly, after swilling out the tumbler. \" Y'es ; why do you ask ? \""], [303, "A PARSON AT BAY. 295 \"Cold water an't the liquor to wash clown cold news with. Make it 'alf-and-'alf, sir; I would,\" he added, handing the glass only7 half filled. Phil poured some whiskey from his flask with rather a shaky hand, refraining for the present from asking the precise nature of the news. \" Have a drink y7ourself, Bob ? \" he said presently. \" No, thankee, sir ; I've tried drinkin', and I've tried swearin', but my heart's just as low as 'twas afore. Narves all saggin' about, too, like a watch buoy in a tide-race. I should come clown to doctor's stuff if I was to stay here much longer. That milksop Collins turns my stummick, I reckon.

I wouldn't have believed it of you, Bob. It's the old story, I suppose ; the ship's sinking, and so \" Ay, ay, sir ; 'tis the old story, if you like. The sea's the place for me ; I can't abide stickin' on land another whole winter. They got no room for me on any of the boats 'twixt this and Christ mas, but till then I'm to be took on tempor'y as a porter at Bavant station. I settled it all last night.\" \" I don't care a d \u2014 n what becomes of you ! I'm utterly disgusted with you ; y7ou promised to stick to your master, at least until \""], [304, "296 A PARSON AT BAY. \" Light up, sir, light up,\" put in Bob, quietly ; \" you won't see straight till yrou've got a pipe between your teeth.\" Phil's angry flush died away as he slowly drew out pipe and pouch. He perceived that Bob was only7 trying to get a rise out of him by way of lightening his own depression. The truth would come out soon enough, when Bob's conduct would appear in a different light. Meanwhile, curiosity was swamped by7 alarm ; Phil was in no hurry to learn what had happened. While away at Kimmer sham, he had heard once from his brother ; and the letter was so full of savage bitterness, in fact, alto gether so unlike Claud's handiwork, that he had cut short his wildfowling to come home a week sooner than he had intended. He now began to recount, in a hasty7 parenthetic sort of way, certain duck-shooting adventures with his late host, Captain James, R.N. But Bob made no pretence of being interested ; nor had Phil spirit enough either to start a new topic or to ask a plain question as to what had been going on in his absence. The talk soon died of inanition. Phil was now seated upon the pump-trough, smoking fiercely7. Robert Keylock had spread himself against the stable wall, with his arms crossed ancl his legs very wide asunder. After a silence of some minutes the latter began O abruptly : \u2014 \" She've took the box-seat since you left, and drove every one of her team up to the bit, look."], [305, "A PARSON AT BAY. 297 She've got a tight hand on the reins, sir, has my lady ; ancl she'm pretty7 free with the whip, too.\" The listener made no audible comment upon this statement, but relieved his feelings by kicking viciously at the wooden pump-shaft. \" She've took the lead, I say : the whole house hold's been under her thumb. She've reckoned to crush the master by throwing her whole weight upon him, and keeping it there. He han't breathed free since first he sat down to table along wi' her. She's been like a snake always coiled round him, squeezin' tighter every time as he moved. He flew out at her a night or two agone, but I reckon that was his last kick. He up ancl cursed her solemn, he did \u2014 I 'eared every word through the open study winder. He called her a torturer, said she'd broke he on a wheel, or suthin' ; had offered he a helpin' hand, and with the same hand had drove cold iron through his heart. She answered low, ancl I couldn't catch her words. I reckoned then as he'd keep all on fightin' ; but the very next mornin' he was hove down by a fresh squall \u2014 and I don't know as he'll ever stand upright again.\" \" What happened next morning ? \" He got a letter : I saw un open it. He told me all about it, with his face like chalk an' his breath comin' short. ' Robert,' he sez, ' I'm done now : that's the last straw, I tell you : my sun has set, Robert,' he sez. Then he 'xplained that the letter was one he'd been afeard on for some time"], [306, "298 A PARSON AT BAY. \u2014about the repairs of the vicarage. It came from a surveyor, the dios \u2014 something \" \" The diocesan surveyor ? \" \" Oh d\u2014 n the 'xact name, sir, axin' your pardon. Anyway the master's got to pay7 some hundreds \u2014 more'n he's got in the world, he said \u2014 for repairs o' the parsonage. It an't been repaired for a long time, and last winter's gales knocked it about a deal. He put the letter down with a sob a'most like a woman's : then he went mad-like for a bit. Y'ou've seed him baddish at times, but never like that. I looked round the study to see as there was no weapon handy, but there was nothin' more than a quill pen or two lyin' about. Arter that, he cried quiet for a spell, ancl axed for Miss Charmie. I wan't going to let any o' they see him in that state, so I fetched the littl'un myself, and left her with him. He took her out on the cliff later on \u2014 for about the last time maybe.\" \" Oh, surely he hasn't \" \" Yes, he have, sir I \" retorted Bob, in a low hoarse tone ; \" he've caved in. M'lady has got her cussed will at last \u2014 the littl'un's made over to her for good.\" Hearing this, Phil cleared his throat hastily, jumped clown from the trough, and disappeared round the corner of the stable. Robert planted himself afresh against the stable wall ancl awaited the gentleman's return with apparent unconcern : he had, it seemed, got at a kind of philosophy by the exhaustive method ; for,"], [307, "A PARSON AT BAY. 299 having vainly tried drinking, swearing, and quarrel ling, there was no other palliative resource open to him. Mr. Philip, who had a habit, when much per turbed or excited, of shooting out his arms and agitating his body in a manner peculiar to himself, returned shortly in a very jerky condition. Bob grinned from force of habit as he watched him, but with no heartiness ; Mr. Phil's muscular antics had little relish for him this afternoon. \" Good God ! \" cried Phil, wiping his flaming face as he strode to and fro, \"can nothing be done to stop this ? My brother doesn't know what he's giving up.\" \" He's about broke, sir ; that's where it is,\" said Bob, wagging his head mournfully. \"Parson Brokenheart '11 never hold up his head again, as they all say up and down the water.

Meanwhile she'll hurry on with her own fit-out, ancl sneak off to Jamaikey7 with the little un afore Parson Broken heart can pull hisself together enough for another slap at her. I've been a-watchin' her little game for ever so long.\" \" She's a God-forsaken woman ! \" cried Phil, with his kindly7 face half unrecognizable with passion. \" Ay7 \u2014 an' I hope to tell her so about five o'clock this evening, when she's comin' round the garden with me,\" retorted Bob, with quiet grimness. \" I give the master notice partly because I knew she was lookin' forward to givin' me the sack herself in a week or two, ancl partly7 to get the chance of a free tongue wi' her.

Arter that, I can die happy \u2014 or even go a-porterin' to Bavant station.\" \"Have you seen anything of the Quay folk lately ? \" Mr. Phil stopped in his perambulations to ask this simple-seeming question, as though by7 way of escaping from the painful subject that had been occupying them ; but Bob knew well that the question was in reality a feeler, a dropping of the plummet into another painful subject \u2014 one which"], [309, "A PARSON AT BAY. 301 could not be discussed between them, though their minds were full of it. \" Oh yes, sir,\" was the casual answer. \" I rowed down clay afore last to see if there was any room for me aboard any o' the boats.\" \"Er\u2014 were they still talking of the inquest? Did you hear anything new as to poor Nan's death ? \" \" Nothin' partic'lar.\" Bob spoke curtly enough, but the other gathered from his tone that the \" nothing particular \" might perhaps cover a good deal. Phil was painfully aware that the Quay and village had certain dark suspicions concerning that strange scene at the gravel-pit which must inevi tably make their way \u2014 if they had not already done so \u2014 into the upper strata of the neighbour hood's society. He had found conversations dropping suddenly at his approach, had caught detached words as he passed public-house windows, and, through one source and another, had pieced together the popular theory as to the American's presence in the quarry. He had hoped against hope that the malicious gossips were hunting a false trail ; ancl certainly Otis's evidence at the coroner's inquest had been clear enough. His presence on the spot had been quite simply explained. He had been strolling, it appeared, along the upper verge of the marsh, studying effects for a twilight picture of the estuary and harbour, and so had chanced to be close to the"], [310, "302 A FARSON AT BAY. quarry when the fatal shot was fired. Some of his friends had seen and admired several of his studies for the picture ; not one of them thought of suspect ing at the time the story told to the coroner's jury. But the Quay fishermen had a view of their own ; they believed the artist's first narrative, told to themselves under stress of strong emotion, and before the narrator's inventive faculty had a chance of exercising itself. Thus, not daring to ask a direct question of any7body, Phil had been much harassed by doubts and misgivings ; nor did a careful searching of his memory tend to allay these. He had always been aware of Aubrey's hatred of the American, and latterly had strongly suspected its true cause. And, supposing Aubrey to have been fearful of any7 real danger, he was just the man to take some such violent course as that of compelling Otis to meet him, ancl \u2014 yet surely he would not have taken such a step without some definite evidence to go upon ! What could have brought his suspicions to a climax ? Yet again, assuming that there were real danger, would not the spread of these river-side rumours tend to precipitate a crisis by making it impossible for Otis to draw back ? Phil was in the position of one holding certain clues and threads, but neither knowing how to use them, nor daring to call in the assistance of any extraneous person. He had never been quite so loth to face the vicarage household as he was this afternoon ; but, after some farther desultory talk with Bob, he"], [311, "A PARSON AT BAY. 303 gathered himself together and sauntered dejectedly away through the shrubbery gate. Bob then resumed his seat upon the trough, to await, with what patience he could muster, the advent of Lady Wroughton's maid. The latter arrived on the stroke of the named hour \u2014 her mistress being always as rigidly punctual as she expected other people to be \u2014 with orders for Robert to come round to the front lawn immediately. Proceeding whither, Bob found his enemy planted in the midst of the grass-plot, evidently considering the question of alterations. Upon his approach the lady began at once, in her firm decisive way \u2014 \" This lawn is far too public ; the shrubbery must be continued all round that side to cover it from the entrance-gate. The borders in front of the drawing-room windows are in a wretchedly unkempt state ; however, as you are not a regular gardener, there was not much to be expected of you, and I shall make no complaints.\" \" There's to be no complaints ? \" muttered Bob, to himself. \"We shall see about that, m'lady. I reckon there'll be some, from one side or t'other, afore we've done with each other ! \" The tall stern-featured lady, with her aquiline nose and proud carriage, would at any time have contrasted oddly with Robert Keylock, the ex fisherman, with his homely impudent face and shell-back figure, ancl on this occasion their differing moods made the juxtaposition of the pair"], [312, "A PARSON AT BAY. 304 especially striking. The lady's face was softened almost to gentleness by the magic finger of Happi ness. She had won her heart's desire : little Gold hair was her own, her very own, to be carried away over the sea, to nestle against her heart until the time should come to watch beside her dying pillow. Now, in the late afternoon of her life, the sun had burned his way through the clouds, and was half blinding her old eyes with his brilliance. Her heart was younger than it had been five and twentv years ago ; the touch of fairy Charmian's wand had made those years as though they had never been. She could only speak in her usual tone now by an effort of will ; even the task of discharging Keylock, which she meant to accomplish presently, would go against the grain in spite of her dislike of the man. True, there were specks of compunction in her happiness, but these she could remove by assiduous care for the future of Claud and Maisie. He was naturally upset just at present, but would soon recover his tone ; and Maisie had been kinder to him lately \u2014 they would yet be a united couple, thanks to Aunt Mabel's generosity; and, with, his load of anxiety removed, Claud's bitterness would in time merge into grateful appreciation of all that had been done for him. Into the fine shades of this beatific mood Bob Keydock could not enter ; he saw only a cruel woman elated by a mean triumph over the man whose happiness Fate had placed in her hands. Nevertheless, it was less easy7 to assail her than he"], [313, "A PARSON AT BAY. 305 had imagined. The opening sentences which had suggested themselves so readily when rehearsing this scene in the saddle-room, seemed less suitable as he conned them over now. In plain truth, he was more than half afraid to begin. Neither his courage nor his impudence were wont to fail him thus. Upon man or woman of his own class he would, with his master's injuries goading him as they now were, have fallen tooth and nail without a thought of hesitation ; but wealth and position must always have some share of the divinity that \" doth hedge a king.\" Bob had grown used to looking upon my lady as the arbitress of the vicarage destinies, to see the life of the household dwelling upon her will, swayed this way or that by her nod. In short, he was in need of a fresh stimulus : a harsh word from her ladyship would be a godsend just now. But the harsh word was not forthcoming. Instead of this, Bob's views were requested as to the laying down of turf, the planting of shrubs, and the like ; all which matters were discussed solely in relation to his master's probable wishes. The space of garden commanded by the study windows was especially considered : was Mr. Brockenhart fond of a blaze of flowers, or would he prefer a simple vista of grass and evergreen ? How would a gravel path leading from this point round to the front of the house suit him for strolling along with a book when the grass was too wet for the purpose ? At every stride, as they passed slowly round the little domain, Bob felt his revenge getting further from 20"], [314, "306 A PARSON AT BAY. him. The lady had Mr. Brockenhart on her mind, spoke of his wishes without ceasing ; the while her would-be assailant was passing through the bitter experience which comes, sooner or latter, to every sound hater \u2014 that of knocking his head against unexpected virtues, discovered in the hated one just at the wrong moment, and calculated to spoil a man's enjoyment of his just grudge. He listened as far as possible in sullen silence, but failed to draw a single bracing rebuke from her ; nor did he perceive that the great lady, being a little uneasy in conscience, as well as perfectly aware of his strong partisanship, was unconsciously trying to justify herself in his sight. Upon reaching the furthest corner of the walled enclosure, where a child's tools, scattered over a little banked-up piece of ground, proclaimed this to be Miss Charade's garden, Bob's enemy completed his discomfiture by turning the conversation to the subject of his uncle Keydock's career ; speaking with kindness, and even some admiration, of the old man's curious power over the rough colony at the Quay, his rigid adherence to his own scheme of right and wrong, and of the last pitiful madness which had ended so tragically. At this point Robert sullenly changed his plan, resolving to begin with an appeal rather than an attack. He knew that nothing he could say would do any good, but felt that his mind would be easier in the years to come for this last effort to save his master. Clutching the child's spade by the handle, and"], [315, "A PARSON AT BAY. 307 half leaning upon it, he began, almost falteringly, \u2014 \u25a0 \"Y\"ou see, mum, my uncle had but one child. Robbed of his pride in her, he went mad-like. If he had had others may7be he'd have bore the knock as other men bear sim'lar ones ; but the father of one child, if he cares for her, is like a target that's all bull's-eye\u2014 every shot that's let fly at un hits the black ! \" The words were spoken in so tense and peculiar a tone that Bob's listener knew at once what was coming. He was looking away from her, yet he felt that she was stringing herself up ; that she was furious with him for daring to speak at all, but meant to stand her ground, to fight and not to flee. They had the garden to themselves ; a leaden sky was brooding over them ; the crash of the ground swell on the beach came at long measured intervals over the low south wall. \" Now, I saw the master,\" Bob continued without further preface, \" goin' round this here bit o' garden with Miss Charmie t'other clay, and just here, where I stand, she stopped and give him a flower of her own accord \u2014 a bit of a Michaelmas daisy from her own patch. Well, he kissed it, ancl shoved it into his letter-case \u2014 I wish you'd seen un do it.\" \" I am perfectly aware that your master is fond of his child. Perhaps you are not aware that the doctors say she can never live to grow up in this climate ; that, by taking her abroad, I give her a chance of health which her father could never give her ? I only trouble myself to explain this out of"], [316, "308 A PARSON AT BAY. consideration to you as a faithful servant. You will now take those tools indoors, and inform your master that I am ready to discuss with him my plans for the improvement of his garden.\" \"Did the doctor say, m'lady, as Miss Charmie couldn't live outside o' the West Indies ? I don't reckon he'd have told such a big un as that, even t'oblige a lady ! We allays understood as she'd do very well with care, and change now and then, and the other things as money can give : it was a matter o' money7 in the main \u2014 that's what we heered.\" \" I told you to go indoors, Keylock ! \" \" I'm agoin', m'lady ; but as you was so t'explain about the doctor's verdick, I thought I might make so bold as to ax a question or two more.\" \" I gave you no permission to ask questions : go back to the house at once, sir ! \" \" Very good, mum ; but if I mustn't ax nothin', p'raps you'll let me tell you a thing or two ? It seems to me \u2014 if you'll let a common man speak free to 'ee for once in a way \u2014 as your conscience ain't quite easy, and maybe I might smooth un down a little for'ee ? \" \" You're an impudent pushing fellow, Keylock, and \" \" Ah, I allays was, mum, thank the Lord ! Hows'ever, I was a-goin' to tell you, 'cos it seems onfair that you shouldn't know it, that the village and the country-side is sayin' all manner o' hard things about 'ee. They say 'tis a cursed shame (savin' your presence, m'lady, but them was the"], [317, "A PARSON AT BAY. 309 words) to rob a pore gentleman of his only child. They say as you've schemed to do it all along ; that you've took advantage of his misforti'ns to do this cursed crule thing, and that some day the Lord'll smite you harder nor you've smitten Parson Brokenheart ! \" The lady, thus outraged, fell back swaying ancl quivering with wrath, yet with a crushing instinc tive sense that the fellow was reporting his neigh bours truly. Until now she had not given a thought to public opinion. Intense concentration upon her own point of view had brought veritable self-persuasion, but she had never thought of a public conscience while so busily engaged with her own. \" If you don't b'lieve me, mum,\" proceeded Bob, before she could recover herself enough to utter a word, \" you try a stroll down along, now that it's spread through the village as you've set your heel on the parson's neck ; though, if you do, 'tis like enough you'll be hooted. Fisher-folk and villagers have their feelin's, look ; and they've been running pretty strong hereabouts ever since the master's pupils was took away. I advise you solemn not to show your nose among 'em, m'lady ! \" \"I discharge you \u2014 I'll give you money to go now at once \u2014 and never to show your face here again ! \" \" Oh, for the matter o' that, mum, 'tis done a' ready. The master discharged me yes'day for speakin' disrespectful o' your ladyship.\""], [318, "A PARSON AT BAY. 310 \" That's a lie ! \" cried the lady, regaining her voice suddenly, and panting with passion. \" So 'tis ! \" retorted Bob, who had also reached the red-hot point, and was hurling his words forth like stones from a sling ; \" 'tis the biggest lie as ever I told ! I give notice myself a-purpose to have my fling agen' you, and to lose you the pleasure o' givin' me the sack with your own tongue. You can't hurt he now ; you can't fall upon he for not dischargin' of me. An' if you did, he wouldn't care a cuss now ; you've knocked the life clean out of un, and if you trampled on's face he wouldn't feel it now. You've scored, mum, you've scored heavy7 ; you've played a broken gentleman for what was left of his heart \u2014 and won ! But damme if I envy you ! I'd rather have a cart load of ordinary sins on my conscience than one such robbery as yours. 'Tis a base, low, mean piece o' thievin', the thought o' which will eat into y7our life like rust when you've got away over seas with your booty. You may soft-sawder the child into lovin' you, but the love'll never warm your heart. You'll never drive out o' y7our mind the face of the father as you've robbed. . . . And, lookee, mum, one word more afore we part \u2014 have an eye on your niece ! I tell you that while you've been givin' yrourself over to the business o' crushin' my7 master there's been mischief afoot as y7ou might have put a stopper on.

But every one knows that she's never cared for un ; that she's a selfish chit as has helped un down the hill with her extravgance, and that her ancl you together have been the ruin of un. There, m'lady, I've pretty well said all what I had to say, and, as I reckon you've had about enough o' this here garden, I needn't block the road to the house any longer.\" The lady cast a blighting glance upon Bob as she walked unsteadily past him, but he seemed to have quite beaten down her powers of speech. Her trembling lips refused to utter a word ; the gathered passion that had been piling itself up behind her silence, ready to pour itself through the first channel that opened, was dammed back and held fast by the pressure of a sudden fear \u2014 the dread lest this new calumny about her niece might contain a grain of truth."], [320, "312 A PARSON AT BAY. CHAPTER XXII. \" Flame trembles most when it doth highest rise.\" \u2014 Sir W. Davenant. ji^\u00a73UXI-AY evening at Bavant. A sombre jfisal autumn evening, brooding over misty meadow and fading woodland, with no strong flash from the west to give a touch of vigour to the day's ending, not a single gleam of gold to glorify decay. In the meadows below the Castle rookery a brother and sister, walking sombrely and in silence ; oppressed, perhaps, by the stillness around them, by a subtle sympathy with fading Nature, around whose sick-bed Night seemed to be mournfully drawing her curtains. Dorothy Otis ancl her brother were traversing in this depressed fashion an open valley that divided the Castle knoll from the spur upon which stood the old parish church of Bavant. The roofs of the town covered a low plateau to the right of them ; on their left the open fields, with their languid curving lines of willow and alder, stretched far away into the dim mist. The girl's face was clouded ; her eyelids drooped heavily7, save when"], [321, "A PARSON AT BAY. 313 she raised them now and then for a swift furtive glance at her brother. \" If Nature had a particle of the human feeling to which she lays claim through poets and others,\" said Dorothy, at length breaking a silence which threatened to last through the entire walk, \" she ought to be grateful for our sympathetic com panionship this evening : we seem to have fallen precisely into her mood; and our depression is a kind of delicate compliment to her dameship \u2014 don't you think so ? \" The artist gave a vague acquiescent mutter, as though just aware that she had spoken, and no more. \"I wish you would answer me, dear. Your silence oppresses me. I can't make you out nowa days, Harry ; you seem \u2014 you are never quite like your old self somehow.\" Even that was more than she had dared to say to her brother latterly. She trembled a little as she said it, for Harry had more than once sternly re pelled any such prying into the state of his feelings. \"Have y7ou lived with me all this time,\" he now retorted angrily, \" without discovering that the artist is necessarily a moody animal ? I've told you often enough that your painter is only one degree more livable with than your poet, and \" \" Oh, Harry, don't put me off with such stuff as that ! My7 dear brother, what is it that has come"], [322, "314 A PARSON AT BAY. between us? I care nothing about your moods \u2014 you are welcome to be as miserable as you please, and to make me the same, \u2014 but \u2014 but I can't bear to be put aside, to stand out of your life and thoughts like a stranger. We have been brother and sister together so long, why should we drift apart from one another now ? \" \" The mystery is easily solved, Dorothy ; you are beginning to find me out. It is the curse of good and gentle women like you,\" he continued, with something like passion, \"to idealize every person and thing that belongs to you. You can't take a man as he stands, accept him once for all for what he is \u2014 a poor creature. I've always told you that I'm no better than the rest, with an average quan tum of rectitude, just good enough for ordinary use, no more. Given the requisite pressure of tempta tion \u2014 an extra half-ounce to the square inch, if you like to put it that way \u2014 and I should go to the bad as certainly as any of them. What is the use of taking a man out of his proper sphere, which is the common ruck, ancl trying to make a hero of him ? I am one of the common ruck, I tell y7ou ; and years hence, when we meet again, you'll realize that I've told you the truth.\" \" Meet again ! What do you mean, Harry ? Who says we are to part ? \" He hastened to explain more quietly, though the face which he turned away as he spoke had the look of one who has let himself blunder egregiously. \" I mean if any ordinary circumstance,"], [323, "A PARSON AT BAY. 315 such as your marriage or mine, were to separate us for a space, and we were to meet again under changed conditions, time would have given you my true measure \u2014 which you have failed to take hitherto.\" \"Well, Harry, dear, I'll try to accept you for what you are \u2014 something between a stage villain ancl a savage Redskin. You must be that, as you insist upon it so strongly, and nothing but silly feminine obstinacy has prevented my acquiescing in your verdict before. Now do y7ou feel happier, dear ? \" Otis sighed impatiently7. He was aware of the fatuity, the hy7pocrisy, even, of thus tiying to break his coming fall, either for her sake or his own. He had been standing long enough on the perilous edge to estimate justly the depth of the fall to which he was committed. The crash must come, and no amount of talk could soften in the smallest degree the blow which was about to fall upon this worshipping sister of his. \" Harry, I feel stifled down here in the low ground, shall we climb up to the churchyard and so get above these marshy mists ? \" \" Yes ; anything you like.\" He knew exactly what was passing in Dorothy's mind. In her present state of vague alarm and anxiety about him there would be a sense of relief in getting him under the shadow of the church, even if she could not entice him into the building."], [324, "316 A PARSON AT BAY. Quickening their pace, they mounted the spur before them by a winding path, and entered the churchyard by a wicket on its southern side. \" Well, now we are up here,\" Dorothy suggested, as they paused just within the gate, \"we may as well stroll about a little. The air is less oppressive on this hill, and as the congregation won't be out for another half-hour we shall have the place to ourselves.\" \" All right ; just as you please.\" They fell to pacing up ancl down a broad path among the ancient gravestones, pausing now and then at its further end to lean over the low churchyard wall, and watch the stealthy creeping of river mists across the wide grey meadow-levels beneath. \" How long will she keep me here ? \" mused the artist, with a faint cynical smile. \" She wants to draw me into the church, with a dim hope of miraculous conversion though the medium of a silly hymn perhaps \u2014 a very woman truly7 ! If she did but know that I would do anything to please her, any mortal thing during these last few days that might tend to sweeten memory for her later on, she might pluck up courage and make the plunge.\" Presently, as they neared the church again, the last hymn before the sermon came floating through the open windows, its childish words made feebler by a feeble tune. \" That checks her again,\" thought the brother."], [325, "A PARSON AT BAY. 317 \" There's not much light and leading in such stuff as that, she fears ; y7et she's screwing herself up, or I'm much mistaken.\" Dorothy was screwing herself up, and presently broke forth abruptly \u2014 \" I should rather like to hear the sermon, Harry ; and the little door is still open ; we could steal in without disturbing them, couldn't we ? \" \"Just as you like, my dear. I would camp in the church all night if that would add anything to your happiness. Who is going to preach ? \" \" You'll see,\" she whispered, leading the way through the narrow doorway. They seated themselves at the extreme end of the church, and Otis cast a weary glance up the long nave to see which of the local geniuses had been chosen for his awakening ; for he felt certain now that Dorothy had practised a little fraud upon him, had planned this ending to the walk from the moment of setting forth. But the occupant of the pulpit, kneeling in prayer, was not distinguish able. Looking again, a second or two later, he saw the light of the pulpit candles falling upon the tall white-robed figure of Parson Brockenhart. This discovery struck so oddly upon Otis that he was almost minded to utter a loud reckless laugh. It seemed to him that Fortune, w7ho had so often made game of him, had thwarted his good resolu tions so invariably, ancl had ended by thrusting him into a position from which there was no exit save"], [326, "318 A PARSON AT BAY. through social crime, had reserved for this moment the most finished and delicate of her ironies. He was now, at the eleventh hour, when nothing could avert the crisis, to be solemnly preached to by \u2014 Maisie's husband ; by the man of whom, had circum stances permitted, he would gladly have made a friend, whom he could never get out of his thoughts, yet could never think of without a feeling of sickness and shame. He had never heard of Claud Brocken hart's preaching here before, and had not for a moment expected to be confronted by him. Yet there was no escape, for he could not leave the church now without bringing to a head his sister's suspicions, and perhaps those of other people. As to the latter he need not, as a matter of fact, have concerned himself. The honest townspeople who made up the bulk of the congregation had heard nothing as yet of the scandal that had been stealthily working its way from the shanties on Lobster Quay to the big houses of the neighbour hood. Indeed they knew nothing beyond a few bare facts about the preacher who was on the point of addressing them, since, to those who go on foot, a distance of five miles makes a zone considerable enough to swallow up the details of any country parson's life. They were pleased to have the chance of hearing this Vicar of Marsh-under-Cliff, as being a preacher of note, and, better still, as a man who had been attacked in the papers, had quarrelled with the earl, ancl was rumoured to be on the verge"], [327, "A PARSON AT BAY. 319 of bankruptcy ; under which circumstances even a dull fellow7 takes on some gloss of attractiveness. Moreover change is always agreeable, ancl Bavant was somewhat tired of the sound and fury of its deep chested rector, Mr. Fanshawe. Thus the present congregation were settling themselves down in a spirit of cheerful anticipation, rather than of strained interest. It happened to be some months since they had heard a sermon from Mr. Brockenhart. Their rector was a friend of his, and a good fellow in a general way ; but good fellowship is not incompa tible with human vanity, nor does the balm of friendship necessarily suffice to heal the smart of being outshone in one's own pulpit. Mr. Fanshawe had a fine phy7sique, and thought his sermons as powerful as the voice in which they were delivered, so there was a little natural soreness in finding that absent bookish fellow Brockenhart more talked of as a preacher than himself. To-night, however, the rector was away, and no one but Mr. Brockenhart, whose own pulpit was occupied by the curate of Bavant this evening, happened to be available as a stop-gap. \" Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thy integrity ? Curse God, and die.\" The text was given out with a half-suppressed energy that was in itself electrifying : it was clear that Mr. Brockenhart's nerves were highly strung, that there would be no lack of heart-flame in his eloquence to-night."], [328, "320 A PARSON AT BAY. \" From Job, of course,\" mused Otis : \" his mind may well be running upon that book just now.\" The preacher, however, though more highly wrought than was apparent \u2014 for he knew no medium nowadays, his mood being always cold as ashes or hot as the flame that has caused them \u2014 was too well practised in his art to tear a passion to tatters. Judging from his excited looks and his manner of giving out the text, Otis was looking for just that intemperate kind of eloquence which most offended his fastidiousness, but in a few sentences he recog nized, with a true artist's quick sensibility, that the preacher belonged, like himself, to the great brother hood, ancl was about to speak more as a fellow-man than a priest. The discourse, in fact, promised to be of human suffering in general, rather than of Job's in particular \u2014 of the groaning and travailing of all things that have life. It was the muffled cry of a stricken man, trying, as it were, to make* his own capital of suffering bear interest for the good of his fellows, and full of tense, though restrained, eloquence. Every sentence was smooth, and every word went crisp and clear through the silence to the furthest corner of the darkened aisles. The artist hung, fascinated, upon what was to him a revelation of the speaker's inmost self, a perfectly modulated, artistic exposition in general language of those private griefs to which he could give no more explicit outpouring."], [329, "A PARSON AT BAY. 321 The majority of the congregation did not consider the sermon in this light ; the preacher seemed only to be speaking of the heart-sinkings and despairs which every one of them had known at one time or another. Indeed Otis, with his naturally keen instinct sharpened to the utmost, seemed to himself to be listening, not to the words, but to the heart throbs of him who spoke them. He perceived one thing which even Dorothy, who leaned back with her veil drawn down, too much moved to notice whether her brother shared her feeling or not, had not the least inkling of \u2014 that the preacher who was urging upon them the sublimity of the faith at which Job's wife railed, was himself wavering. His closing sentences, as it seemed to Otis, were the last upward leap of a flame that had nearly burned itself out ; Dorothy had brought her brother to be con verted by one who would soon, very soon, be himself in need of conversion. And he, who had read the man so surely, whose heart had been beating in closer unison with the preacher's than had that of any other soul in this rapt congregation, was fated, it appeared, to give the final stroke to the waverer. Nothing could now avert the stroke. That fatal admission of his on the Quay had made it inevitable ; perhaps it had been almost inevitable from the first moment of his settling in Maisie's neighbourhood, the conditions being what they were, \u2014 with, on the one side, a vain woman oppressed by discontent and narrow means, and bound to her husband by nothing more than a conventional tie ; on the other, a man 21"], [330, "322 A PARSON AT BAY. smarting with disappointed love, and held fast by no stronger threads than those spun by a fastidious taste and some vague yearnings after the Good and the True. Inevitable, quite inevitable ; ancl yet \u2014 the pity of it, the pity of it !"], [331, "A PARSON AT BAY. 323 CHAPTER XXIII. \" What need to strive with a life awry? Had I said that, had I done this, So might I gain, so might I miss ? Brownins. ES73 F there chanced to be born into the world a tS-lS-l man gifted with the power, generally supposed to be so desirable, of seeing himself exactly as others saw him, his life would surely be one long bewilderment. For not only would he have to support the endless shocks of self-discovery brought about by his neighbour's shrewder insight, but the infinite puzzlements resulting from their differing standpoints. He would be forced indeed to realize, with a new and special clearness, the truth of the homely old adage to the effect that one man's meat is another's poison. He would perceive, perhaps, with some surprise, that the high moral sensibility which his friend A respected and admired so heartily was as a hopeless barrier set up between himself and B ; while, on the other hand, he might find the latter drawn to him at odd moments, in spite of his exasperating virtues, by some little vicious tendency over which A had often mourned in"], [332, "324 A PARSON AT BAY. secret. Such a man might be tempted in cy7nical moments to define the popular man as \" the one whose virtues are found least intolerable by his neighbours.\" The definition would doubtless be unsound ; but your neighbours' inability to bear up against one another's good qualities tempts you at times to fall back upon something of the sort, something sounder perhaps, but hardly7 more amiable. Certainly7, if Claud Brockenhart had been able to view himself through his wife's ey7es, and, say, those of one other person, he would have been as much bewildered as this imaginary seer. His old casual optimism in money matters, for instance, which most people would have called a weakness, had served to attract Maisie ; while the worldly7 simplicity ancl conscientiousness, which had won for him Hereward Otis's respect, had only tended to alienate her. She was vexed with him for not smoothing out such of his principles as stood in his way with Aunt Mabel ; and, as pressure increased, his new strictness in money relations, and consequent rigid economies, were a growing offence to her. The more meekly ancl patiently he accepted his fate, the less tolerable did she find him ; and yet the very virtues which had been feeding her discontent had affected Otis so differently7 that, at one time, as we have seen, he had been within measurable distance of a notable self-conquest. But at length a change had come ; Claud's meek ness had given place to something quite different ;"], [333, "A PARSON AT BAY. 325 and, just at a time when it would have been desirable to maintain a full head of resentment against him, Maisie found herself being drawn towards her husband. He had been put upon his trial \u2014 the trial by Adversity \u2014 and been found wanting. He had risen to no hero -height of resignation, but had succumbed to troubles which, if many in number, were in kind only such as fall to the lot of hundreds of poor gentlemen. He had not, it appeared, innate strength enough to walk firmly under the imposed yoke, nor, on the other hand, enough of old-martyr spirit to bow beneath it in humble resignation. His sermon at Bavant church appeared, in fact, to be, as the artist had predicted, the last leap of a wavering flame ; he could not have preached it again next day without a crashing sense of hypocrisy. He was no longer a humble striver against difficulty, but a sullen embittered rebel. It was a strange party that met together in the vicarage dining-room at this period. They only did so at meal times, the vicar living entirely apart from the others during the rest of the day. Nor, when the gong sounded, and his study door opened, could they tell in what mood he would appear, whether he would sit through the meal in stony silence, or pour forth a continuous stream of fierce, half-wild talk. Aunt Mabel had actually grown afraid of the quiet parson : when he addressed her at all, it was with a bitter scorching politeness that subdued and frightened her, and her answers were always gently propitiatory. There seemed to be"], [334, "326 A PARSON AT BAY. an outburst of invective always hovering upon his lips, ready to fall upon her were she to cross him by a single word. Maisie heartily wished that her aunt would utter the word. She was now more in sympathy with Claud than she had been for months. She would have been glad enough to see his smouldering fury break forth \u2014 a state of things which would certainly have ended in his throwing his contract with Aunt Mabel back in her face, and her final dismissal from the house. But Aunt Mabel was far too shrewd to play into his hands thus; having won the prize, she could afford to be meek, and even cowardly. She was blind and deaf to all his challenges, and bore him down by a persistent yielding, as she had formerly done by continuous pressure. His savage desire to pick a quarrel with her was, in fact, of material assistance to her ; an exhibition of martyr-like resignation might have inflamed her sore conscience seriously. As it was, her triumph was giving her but a precarious, fearful kind of joy, and her one desire was to get away7 with the child as soon as possible. Dreading some out break, she durst not even see Charmian in her father's presence ; and, in truth, she got little chance of doing so, since he hardly ever allowed the little thing out of his sight. Phil found the home so miserable, and the change iii his brother so painful to look upon, that he slipped away to his naval friend at Kimmersham, arranging to come back at a moment's notice on receipt of any message from Maisie."], [335, "A PARSON AT BAY. 327 This escape of Phil's fired Lady Wroughton with desire to make a similar flitting, but, in her case, it was not to be managed quite so easily. She was really afraid of some hostile demonstration on the part of the villagers if she were to make a public departure ; for Bob Keylock, she found, had exagge rated but little their resentful hostility towards her. She settled the matter at length by driving off to the station one morning, without previous warning to any one, and then and there departing for Southampton, in the neighbourhood of which she was to stay while making final preparations for the westward voy7age. It was an oddly ignominious flight for a personage of her importance ; she could not, of course, venture to say good-bye to Claud, but started in stealthy haste while he was out on the cliffs with the child, leaving Maisie to despatch her maid and luggage next day7. As regards her niece, at any rate, Lady Wroughton went away quite easy in her mind. After Robert Keylock's departure, which occurred the morning after her scene with him in the garden, she had cross-questioned Maisie pretty sharply as to those supposed calumnious rumours ; and Maisie's nerve and wit by no means failing her, she had laughed her aunt's fears down the wind with perfectly acted naturalness. Nor had Aunt Mabel seen any society lately except that of Miss Crackanthorpe, who had a certain reason for not enlightening her. And further, Mr. Otis had just left for town, whither his sister was to follow him shortly ; and it was generally"], [336, "328 A PARSON AT BAY. understood that they were to spend the late autumn and winter in Italy7. He was safe out of the way for another six months at least. Her aunt's departure left Maisie alone with her husband, as on the whole she desired to be. He was still perfectly unsuspicious of her, and, thanks to his present seclusion from the outer world, was likely7 to remain so until the time for suspicion had gone by. Meanwhile, she could make a last effort to compensate him, at least in such poor measure as the case would admit of, for \u2014 what was coming. The feeling which had been prompting the American to yield to every slight wish of his sister's, and scheme out little futile plans of enjoyment for her, had its counterpart in Maisie's attitude towards her husband ; but in her case the feeling was pro portioned to the deeper remorse that prompted it. She used to have much power over Claud ; and her present hope was so far to revive this as to press him into freeing himself, before it was too late, from his contract with Aunt Mabel. That closing week of her life with Claud was the strangest Maisie had ever known. There was some thing abnormal and strange about every hour of those miserable seven days. For the first time since their marriage, she had become profoundly7 solicitous about him ; for the first time, she was making an earnest appeal to him, renewed hour by horn, and backed by all the will and the wit she possessed, in his own interest. But the old influence had gone, to return no"], [337, "A PARSON AT BAY. 329 more; Claud was stone cold to her entreaties. It seemed that there was nothing of his old kindness left to respond to this strange new kindness of his wife's. He would go over wearily and mechanically the old points of the case, the steps down which he had been compelled to descend. It was clear that he was a beaten man, with no courage left to answer to the spur. After the departure of his enemy, whose presence had served to keep his blood hot, he sank quickly into a state of apathy7. Yet Maisie persisted resolutely, goaded by the thought that she had herself brought him low, ancl that without one grain of advantage to herself. She had herself begun the assault upon him, had played into Aunt Mabel's hands for the sake of ends which, now that they were gained, had no meaning for her. The man had been sacrificed for nothing. As the day7s passed by, her desire merged into an intense hysterical longing ; but still her words went by the passive dead-hearted man like the idle wind. And so the last day came. This was a Tuesday. All next day Claud was to be away at Southampton, whither he was going to inspect the ship in which Charmian ancl her aunt were to sail in a fortnight's time. When he said good-bye to Maisie on Wednesday morning he would be bidding her a longer farewell than he dreamed of. On Tuesday morning a telegram arrived from Aunt Mabel, stating that her preparations were complete sooner than she had expected, and, if the"], [338, "330 A PARSON AT BAY. child could possibly be got ready, she would be glad to sail, after all, by to-morrow night's boat, the Kestrel, a finer vessel than that starting a fortnight later. But they must not put themselves to serious inconvenience ; she could wait until the date originally named if necessary.

The boy's waiting for the reply-message. Give me a pencil, Claud, at once ; there's no need to think about it.\" \" I'm not so sure about that,\" he muttered hoarsely ; \" it may be better on the whole to \u2014 to You see, the child's ready ; there's no doubt of that.

Fourteen day7s hence I shall have sunk so many degrees lower. It may be better to agree. I'll think about it for half an hour before wiring back.\" \" Don't yrou see that she has been playing with you ? \" cried Maisie, vehemently7 ; \" that she has intended all along to sail by this boat in order to reduce y7our chance of turning upon her ? It is a"], [339, "A PARSON AT BAY. 331 piece of bluff, I tell you\u2014 a bold attempt to catch you breathless and unprepared, to cut the last plank from under your feet at a stroke.\" \" What is that to me ? \" he retorted, trying to steady the bitter working of his lips. \"What does it matter whether this woman has beaten me by fair means or foul? If the little thing had grown stronger instead of weaker, or the doctor hadn't shaken my heart with his forebodings ; if I myself had been allowed to supplement by the only means in my power the pittance which is thought good enough for God's minister ; if I weren't hard and fast in debt ; if I had any earthly prospect of making both ends meet without this woman's money ; if I weren't a hopeless, broken-spirited coward, I would go back on my word now at the eleventh hour \u2014 ay, or break a solemn oath, had I taken one \u2014 rather than give up my child. Tush ! I rave like a fool, Maisie. You must see, as well as I, that I've decided rightly for her. She will at least have a chance of health and strength with your aunt ; and the woman loves her, idolizes her, or I would never have consented. Besides, I owe some thing to you \" \" You owe nothing to me, nothing whatever ! \" broke in Maisie, more vehemently than before. \" I tell you it is I who have sunk you so low.

I was bitter against you, and so \u2014 but I can't explain ; things have gone against you, and there's an end of it. But, for God's sake, don't give up little Charmian ; there's no need, I say, no need whatever. I solemnly7 protest that you will be punishing your self for nothing ! \" \" Why, Maisie,\" said the parson, gently, \" what has come to you? We seem to have changed places, somehow ; you are usurping my part when you break out in this fashion. However, now that we are talking things over freely, I had better tell you all that is in my mind. I have decided to give up the living, and shall write to the bishop on the subject in a day or two. I feel that I have no right to perform the functions of a clergyman any longer \u2014 or, at least, until I have worked clear of present perplexities. We must leave this, and go to live in some town where I can get teaching work ; then, with my earnings and your aunt's money7, you'll be better off than you have been yet ; and, perhaps, even, now that you're changing towards me, we may yTet know a kind of happiness together.

She was thinking intensely, yet hardly thinking her own thoughts : for her personality seemed well nigh submerged in her husband's this morning ; she seemed to be seeing things with his eyes, feeling them with his heart and mind. She had heard him, about the time of dawn, when he thought her sound asleep, pouring out his love for the last time in low-muttered syllables beside his sleeping child's cot ; and as the light strengthened, she had watched him, with an anguish of sympathy that perhaps affected her the more for its strangeness, holding the tiny hand of the sleeper to his face as he wept over it for the last time. Her own conduct to the"], [343, "A PARSON AT BAY. 335 man had seemed, by the light of that solemn farewell, inexplicable ; she had felt then that, could the last few months be sponged out, ancl could she begin once more from the beginning her relations with Claud, she could learn quite easily to love him, to cleave to him through worse things than poverty7, as nobler women have done to worse men. There had seemed to be possibilities in herself that she was only just discovering ; the exaltation of profound pity raised her for the moment quite above herself. But the feeling was in flat contradiction to her whole course of conduct to Claud, and what soever might be its significance, it came too late. This morning Claud was evidently strung up, and doggedly resolved to show a bold face to his public. The pride ancl pluck which had deserted him of late had come back to meet his urgent need, bringing with them the power of self-command, between which and complete collapse there would be no middle course for him to-day. The parson was able to talk kindly to his wife, and she did her best to help in the manufacture of a sort of conversation, which, though, in truth, a solemn mockery, was a thing more manageable than silence ; but at first he did not venture to touch, or to speak to, his little daughter. He only looked at her now and then, when, as Maisie knew, he was trying to print deep on his memory the picture of the child sitting on her high chair with the thin autumn sunshine sprinkled through white curtains upon her dainty head ancl shoulders."], [344, "A PARSON AT BAY. 336 Charmian was herself pale and perfectly silent ; her father's artificial cheerfulness made no impres sion upon the gloom which had settled down on her. Up till quite lately she had been full of excitement at the thought of leaving, but at length had somehow come to realize that going away in a great ship with Aunt Mabel, and having a heap of new clothes, meant leaving her daddy for a long time \u2014 ever such a long time ; and all the crying that had been got through upstairs seemed to have eased her heart but little. She was placed further than usual from her father this morning, ancl her little silent appeals to him fell all unheeded. But, as the time passed, they gravitated towards one another, and in the end her hand found its way into his. That was the only caress Claud could venture to allow himself. When the mock meal was over Maisie offered to leave the pair together, for the pony-cart which was to take them to Bavant station might be expected from the inn at any moment. But Claud peremptorily requested her to stay. \" You must back me up,\" he exclaimed half angrily ; \" there are the partings to be got through yet, ancl I'm afraid some of the good people from the village will be at the door. And, look here, Maisie, when I come home to-night I shan't be fit company for any one, and you had better be out of the house.

I haven't done you justice, child ! \" \" Don't go, Claud,\" she cried wildly, \"don't leave me out of your sight for a single hour : if you must go, take me with you ! \" \" Go ancl kiss her,\" muttered Claud to the child. \" Poor Maize can't bear to see our parting, and I'm not fit to comfort any one myself.\" \" Don't leave me alone, I entreat you to take me with you ! \" \" I don't know what has come to you ? \" he cried distractedly. \" I can't take you with me : there's no room in the little two-wheeler, and no time to order anything else \" \"Please, sir,\" said Lizzie, the general servant, precipitating herself into the room at this juncture, \" Mr. Tucker from the Curlew, he's 'ere, and he sez the trap's waitin', and a lot o' folk wants to say good-bye to Miss Charmie ; an' he :sez you must please to look slippy if you wants to catch that there train, an' you gen'ally doesn't catch 'em, he sez. Claud set his teeth, took Charmie by the hand, 22"], [346, "A PARSON AT BAY. 338 and strode away firmly to the door; but quailed for a moment upon finding himself face to face with the crowd which surrounded the hall-porch. He had expected to see half a dozen or so of women and children, but the front lawn ancl small gravelled sweep could hardly contain the throng that had assembled. The whole village, it appeared, as well as a considerable sprinkling of country folks from across the river, had come up the hill to say good bye to the parson's little daughter. Mr. Tucker was standing, watch in hand, ordering people about, and making himself as disagreeable as possible with the evident kindly intention of cutting short a scene which must needs be a severe ordeal for the vicar. \" Now look sharp ancl make a lane for the pony,\" he cried peremptorily, \" or Mr. Brockenhart will miss his train. There's no time for speechifying, look, nor blubbering neither,\" \u2014 with which he pushed aside some tearful women who were pressing upon Miss Charmie, thus making way for the children who had been promised a farewell kiss of the little favourite. These small creatures advanced, solemn-eyed and apparently quite unmoved, delivering each a little present, which Mr. Tucker forthwith appropriated and hastily tossed into the trap. The last child threw a chain of late autumn roses round the weep ing Charade's neck, ancl the moment this was clone Mr. Tucker hoisted her into the trap, out of reach of the womenkind, old or young."], [347, "A PARSON AT BAY. 339 The vicar climbed, half dazed, up to the driver's seat, but could make no acknowledgment of the blessings and kind wishes that were showered upon him. Mr. Tucker, who was more moved than he liked, and hardly knew what he was saying, called out to the man at the pony's head, \" Let 'un go, you d \u2014 d fool, can't you ? \" \u2014 and the pony trotted un concernedly off. In the village there was further waving of hand kerchiefs, mixed with confused shouting of farewells, and at the heel of the bridge they had to face a friendly demonstration from the whole fishing-colony. But, once over the bridge, the parson felt that the worst was over. He was now alone with the little thing for the very last time, with Lord Bavant's woods encompassing the road and, in places, arching it completely over. Charmie was leaning limply against his side ; not a soul was visible along the lonely road ; save Wilkins's cottage, there was not a habitation of any sort to be passed between this and the outskirts of the town. There was in reality7 plenty of time, too ; he could afford to let the pony jog along without troubling about it. He was free to clasp the child close, to let the full tide of his grief bear him away for a space, ancl his y7earning love to pour itself out unchecked; while around him the solemn woodlands seemed to be mourning in silence over the dead and gone summer, as their russet and gold leaves, that had drunk their last of breeze ancl sun, fluttered wearily down to their final rest upon the lap of Mother Earth."], [348, "340 A PARSON AT BAY. By the time they came upon the outlying houses of the town Claud Brockenhart had again taken firm hold of himself, and felt ready to face his task as a man should ; and when, upon turning into the high street, Mr. Tomlinson drove up alongside the pony-trap, he was able to greet his brother parson in ordinary friendly fashion. Mr. Tomlinson was also bound for the station. He was driving a handsome, high-stepping mare, and seemed to be in the highest of spirits ; nor did he notice anything unusual in Brockenhart's looks. The latter was even surprised to find how easily he could impose upon friend Tomlinson. It was one of those moments which demonstrate to a man in how deep an inner solitude he moves ; when he perceives with a kind of astonishment that all the beat and whirl of his own concerns may write nothing upon his face large enough for the friend who greets him in the street to read. They drove side by side for some little distance \u2014 the man who had opened the world's oyster with the first tool that came to hand, and was in full enjoyment of its toothsome contents, and the other, whose moral consciousness had so restricted his choice of tools that the cunning oyster had baffled him. The contrast between them was a grim kind of commentary upon the value of strict honesty as an everyday working policy. Tomlinson's honesty was of a judicious, rather than strict order, and so had enabled him, while drawing an official income which he did nothing"], [349, "A PARSON AT BAY. 341 to earn, to treble the same by work done purely in his own interests. As they drove along he was telling Brockenhart what a fine time he was going to have with some friends in the Highlands. His \"young cubs,\" as he called them, had all de parted for a certain Line Examination, leaving him a free unfettered man. He was going straight up north without wasting an hour in town. Yet, thanks to those wretched \" young cubs,\" he had missed the cream of the autumn salmon-fishing. That was hard, wasn't it ? That was a real griev ance, and he was grateful to Brockenhart for allowing him to spread it out, to expose the full depth and breadth of it. And where was Brocken hart going ? \u2014 to Southampton with his little girl ? Ah, in that case they might travel so far together, ancl he could tell Brockenhart all about the fishing prospects en route. And how was the little woman, eh ? She looked a bit pale ancl peaky, Tomlinson thought \u2014 was in need of change perhaps ? Oh, going a voyage with her aunt, was she ? \u2014 that was capital; that would end in her coming back with cheeks full of roses. Was Brockenhart a fisherman ? No? \u2014 then perhaps he could hardly enter the feelings of a man who had been grinding with pupils through all the glorious spates of October. Brockenhart, however, should himself take to some healthy outdoor pastime or other; for he also looked a bit pale and peaky. Too much midnight oil, no doubt. Ah, there was the station already ; how short the drive seemed on the first day of the"], [350, "342 A PARSON AT BAY. holidays, and what a pleasant aspect could that ugly building assume when you considered it as the starting-place for the Highlands! Tomlinson had never caught himself admiring this long squat piece of brickwork before \u2014 how quaintly subjective man's perceptions are, to be sure ! \" Subjective indeed ! \" mused the other parson, whose sick gaze found quite a different meaning in that same piece of brickwork, and the long roofs that covered the two platforms. The porters naturally crowded round Mr. Tomlinson's dog-cart as he drew up at the station entrance. He insisted, like a genuine sportsman, in clinging to his rod-case : but all his other things were taken up, with a tenderness due to the belongings of so prosperous a man, and carried to the up-platform by a squad of willing lads in fustian. The other parson, as \" a fellow of no mark nor likelihood,\" was no less naturally left to shift for himself. However, as Mr. Brockenhart peered absently about, being a little dazed by the rattle of talk that he had just undergone, a man emerged suddenly from the porter's room, and came to the side of the pony-trap. With a sigh of relief he recognized Robert Keylock, the latest addition to the company's staff of porters. \" Goin' to S'thampton, sir, to inspect the vessel ? \" asked Bob, in his ofl'hand way. \" Yes, to inspect the ship \u2014 and leave Miss Will you take an armful of these small things,"], [351, "A PARSON AT BAY. 343 Robert ? The village children loaded us with them just before we started. We can hardly take them all, I fear?\" Bob understood at once that the little drama was played out, ancl the final act of surrender about to be accomplished. He lifted Miss Charmie to the ground without a word, and found it not so very easy to let her go again ; then collected the nose gays ancl other trifles, and led the way to the waiting room. Upon emerging, with all their odds and ends tied into one parcel, they again encountered Mr. Tomlinson, to whom, in the mean time, a suggestion had evidently occurred. For, goodnaturedly button-holing his friend Brockenhart, he said \u2014 \" By-the-by, it has occurred to me that, as you're looking rather seedy, and as train journeys probably bore yrou as much as they do me, you may be glad to get off this one to Southampton ? I could perfectly well convey your little daughter for you, and deliver her up to the aunt before the train goes on again. They give us five minutes there, I know.\" \" Oh thanks,\" said the other, hastily ; \" but \" Y7ou think her aunt may not be there to meet her?\" \" She'll be there without fail, I don't doubt that ; but I rather wanted to \u2014 see the last of the little thing.\" \" All right, then, let us travel together. Our train is about due, I think.\""], [352, "344 A PARSON AT BAY. But Robert Keylock, who was hovering about his old master, saw at once that he was throwing away a chance by this refusal. He was evidently much shaken by what he had gone through already, and would be likely enough to break down completely before the day was over, especially7 as its worst moment \u2014 that of handing over the child to his enemy \u2014 was y7et to come. The master was not fit to go through with it. No good could possibly come of this last interview with Lady Wroughton ; nor would the parting wrench be one bit less keen for being deferred a few hours longer. He drew Mr. Brockenhart aside a pace or two, and opened upon him at once. \"Beg your pardon, sir, but I reckon you'd do better to let Mr. Tomlinson take her ? \" \" I couldn't, Robert, I couldn't ! \" whispered the parson, hoarsely, laying a trembling hand on the child's shoulder. \" You an't fit to face m'lady ; it'll only7 be a torture to you. She won't leave you a minute alone wi' Miss Charmie. You could do the partin' a deal better here, sir \u2014 in the waitin'-room yonder; and I would see as you wan't interrupted. 'Twould be better for the littl'un, too, sir: your strength's goin', I can see, and it won't do her any good, look, to be along wi' you all day in that state. Or let her go now, ancl you follow arter her by a later train \u2014 how'd that do?

He found himself led insensibly towards the waiting-room, holding fast to his child's hand, yet somehow moving whither he was urged. In a moment or two Robert had shut the door upon them. Almost immediately afterwards the thunder of the up-express became audible. As the train drew up, Bob approached Mr. Tomlinson and exchanged a word or two with him ; then put him hastily into a carriage, thrusting in after him the child's small luggage. Without a moment's delay, Bob strode rapidly back to the waiting-room, wiping his forehead, and huskily muttering, \" It makes one feel like a cussed executioner \u2014 but 'twill save he a deal in the end.\" He flung open the door with the set will and stern countenance of a veritable executioner ; but he could never describe afterwards, either with or with out oaths, what he went through in the second or two which followed upon his entrance. There was no sound from within ; but a man's heart was breaking in the quiet little room while the platform clanged with life and bustle. Just before the train started, Bob strode back with a limp little figure in his arms to the compartment from which Mr. Tomlinson was looking forth \u2014 some what anxiously, for Bob's manner had impressed him."], [354, "346 A PARSON AT BAY. Then there was a clapping-to of many doors, a warn ing shriek of the whistle, and little Charmie was borne away \u2014 to win health and strength, let us hope, in some sunny land or other, for Aunt Mabel was bent upon achieving that end, but nevermore to make sunshine in her father's heart."], [355, "A PARSON AT BAY. 347 CHAPTER XXV. \" Strong and free, strong and free, The floodgates are open, away to the sea.

To Claud Brockenhart it might have seemed that there was no such borderland, for, after the parting scene at the station, he fell away at once into a state of lethargy. For some time he knew nothing of what was happening around him ; Robert Key lock was with him, and they were in the fields \u2014 that was all the description he could have given of the time which elapsed between his leaving the station and subsequent arrival at the familiar landing-stage, where the Bavant people were wont to hire their boats and canoes. It was there that he found himself, upon first emerging from the stunned condition which had held him for some time \u2014 whether a short or long time he could not tell, \u2014 and from thence he was to travel through the strange border-country of quick-dissolving views, of fitful gleam and gloom, and many-changing skies. He found himself stretched upon the greensward by the river, with the external world, which, ever since leaving home this morning had been more or less a blank to him, emerging as from a mist to greet him with the face of a friend. The day must have changed latterly, for he remembered how the breeze had lifted the chdd's hair as they drove across Marsh bridge, and now the air was breathless. The river flowed gently with a surface of gleaming satin ; the reed-beds, over against which the little fleet of boats was moored, uttered not a whisper. The pale amber stems with their dark tressy heads hung motionless"], [357, "A PARSON AT BAY. 349 over the blue mirror that reflected them ; the meadows swam in misty sunshine ; in the gravelly shallow under the opposite bank cows were standing idly as though the sultry noontide were that of veritable midsummer. \" Be you better now, sir ? \" asked Robert Key lock, who was standing at his side, eying him anxiously. \"Yres, I'm recovering, Robert. I don't quite know how we have got here, bnt my mind is clear ing now. I don't think there's any need to keep you longer.\" \" Well, sir, I means to stick by you till I've got you safe back to your moorin's.

I'm per fectly capable of that now, and the gentle exercise will help to steady me.\" \"I'm not agoin' to leave you,\" retorted Bob, doggedly. But the parson's will was returning, and he meant to have his way. \" I shan't move till you go,\" was his only reply to Bob's successive efforts at persuasion. At length the latter moved sullenly off a few paces. \" Stop a minute, Robert ; we may as well shake hands, for who knows when we shall meet again r"], [358, "A PARSON AT BAY. 350 \"Why, lookee, sir \u2014 if that's the state of your mind \"Don't be alarmed.

Be you sure as you're fit to take care o' yourself ? \" \" Yes, yes ; cut along, man ! \" Then Bob went slowly away along the meadow path, ancl his old master turned his mind to the question of hiring a boat. But, though his eyes had cleared, his mind was growing dim again: he hesitated about taking a boat at all, though he had come hither with the express intention of rowing himself down the river. Presently it dawned upon him that it was nothing but the spell of an old habit that restrained him \u2014 the dread of spending a sixpence unnecessarily. That was why he found himself foolishly7 reiterating the old formula \u2014 \" Shilling first hour, sixpence second.\" He smiled dimly at the discovery, recol lecting that from this date the new era of wealth was to begin. The whole weight of the future \u2014 a rather considerable burden to all who combine"], [359, "A PARSON AT BAY. 351 shallowness of purse with depth of imagination \u2014 ought now to be lifting itself from his mind. The fear of leaving a child unprovided for need cloud his brain and shake his heart no longer. Charmian was now- an heiress : he himself was, comparatively speaking, a kind of Dives. He might take a boat for half a day now, if he pleased, though not \u2014 until the new way of looking at things had become in its turn a habit \u2014 without a qualm or two. \" Was you wanting the skiff, sir ? \" inquired an old boatman, presently approaching the reclining figure, ancl rather wondering what to make of Parson Brockenhart to-day. \" Yes \u2014 oh yes, Narraway ; I want the skiff.\" \" The same what you had last week, sir, when you took little missie along with you ? \" \"Yes \u2014 the same boat, with the same sculls and cushions ; don't alter anything. Put on the rudder, too, though I shan't use it.\" \" Then what the doose should I ship it for ! \" grunted Narraway, under his breath ; \" has the man gone daft ? . . . There y'are, sir ! \" he added aloud a minute or two afterwards, \" the Water Sprite's all read for 'ee. And how is little miss? She were looking rather porely t'other day ; I heerd a lady say as the chahld looked fragile as a flower, and was like enough to fade off one of these days if she wan't took care on.\" Mr. Brockenhart, who was doubtless well accus tomed to the kind of Job's comfort which humble folks love to bestow, answered readily."], [360, "A PARSON AT BAY. 352 \" She's on the road to health ancl strength again now, Narraway, \u2014 gone on a sea voyage.\" \" Glad to 'eer it, sir ; them pale little things is apt to rot off like flies when the winter cold comes, ain't they ? \" The parson stripped off his coat and waistcoat, and stepped into the skiff; but, before starting, he arranged the yoke-lines on the cushion aft as though in readiness for a coxswain's hands. \" Going to pick up the missus lower down, for to steer 'ee, I suppose ? \" suggested the boatman affably. \" Sit quite still, dear ! \" whispered the gentleman, just loudly7 enough for the other to hear. \" Good Lord ! he has gone daft, then ! \" muttered Narraway7. The occupant of the skiff, however, was only indulging his fancy ; for the reasoning parts of his mental machinery, he found, had for the present struck work, while on the imaginative side the whirr of wheels was almost deafening. The pictures turned off by Fancy, acting in conjunction with Memory, followed each other in such quick succession that he had, as it were, to clutch at one in order to keep it by him for a moment. Cumber land lake-scenes, ancl other haunts of old reading party days ; street-scenes in Paris ; churches packed with crowded congregations \u2014 all these came unasked. But he would have none of them ; he wanted only a small single-figure piece, and when this came he held it fast, shutting his eyes to all else. The"], [361, "A PARSON AT BAY. 353 picture, thus snatched from the crowd and isolated, grew strangely real, so real that, as he stepped into the boat, he heard his child's laugh ring through him. Like most 'Varsity-trained men, the parson could row a clean stroke ; but he was none the less a poor waterman, and in his present confused state found it difficult to clear himself of the fleet of boats and skiffs that half covered the reed-fringed bay. As he stood up to punt himself over the shallows, Narraway watched him blunder against one boat after another, growling amazedly at his clumsiness. Once clear into the main stream, however, he settled down to his stroke, and shot away steadily enough. For a long time the rhythmic play of the sculls never varied ; curve after curve of the sinuous river lapsed away behind him, group after group of lace-mantled willows, or sombre heavy alders, glided by, and still he worked like a machine. And the dream picture remained with him the while, the gleam of the child's hair was before his eyes, her smile was still answering his. But, upon reaching a point a long way down, where a backwater ran up between walls of bulrush, the oarsman ceased abruptly. This was Charmie's favourite corner, where in early summer the finest forget-me-nots grew, and massed water-lilies made of each little bay a pavement more dazzling than whitest marble. He had been looking forward for the last mile or more to a long rest in this 23"], [362, "354 A PARSON AT BAY. backwater \u2014 with her ; and now, at the very moment of reaching it, lo ! his little companion had vanished. The stream of imagination had run itself dry, leaving bare its bed of hard blank reality. Bitter thoughts came pouring through his brain so thickly that his will could make no head against them. He dashed his sculls savagely into the water ; but his powers were failing, and after half a dozen strokes he stopped abruptly as before. It seemed that, if he still hoped to regain peace of mind at all, he must now come to close quarters with himself, and once for all lay down the lines along which his Hfe was to move in the future. At present, his inner life w as a chaos : he could not go on as he had clone latterly, at one moment a humble remorseful sinner grieving over his own weakness, at the next, a bitter rebel, raving against the scourgings of Fate. It would be well now to O O balance up the havoc which the last few weeks had made in his old faiths and ideals, to decide finally whether to shape his life on the assumption that he was a mere human automaton, the plaything of blind Chance, or on that older assumption which had supported him through the fever and the fret of forty years. Abreast of him, at the opening of the backwater, was a narrow reedy channel, up which he proceeded to thrust his skiff until he found himself buried in the forest of tall brittle stems ; then he slid from his seat, stretched himself at full length upon the foot-boards, and closed his eyes."], [363, "A PARSON AT BAY. 355 He was now completely shut off both from land ancl water ; if solitude could promote clear thinking, he could hardly have been better placed in the heart of a primeval forest, or on the lonely summit, of an alp. Now surely was the time for him to muster his faculties, and regain by one stern effort that mental balance without which a man is no better than a wind-tossed straw. But the solitude seemed to help him not a whit ; his sluggish brain would not answer to the spur, all his faculties seemed to be numbed by the leaden pressure of his heart. For long he lay in a half-stupor, and, but for a trifling incident that befell, might have continued to do so for an indefinite time. Upon reaching out a hand for his coat, however, he touched the letter case that lay in its breast pocket, thus reminding himself of the little coil of hair which the case contained. Drawing out the soft gold coil, he raised himself into a sitting posture, and began to smooth it between his hands. Then, upon raising it to his lips, his lethargic fit broke up suddenly, and he burst into a passion of tears. Such an out pouring of grief had not come to him even when saying farewell to his child under the friendly cover of the Bavant woods. It swept the leaden weight from his heart and the stupor from his brain, and, passing quickly, left him strangely softened \u2014 possessed by that kind of weary half-happiness which is the aftermath of vehement grief. He felt himself drawn along, as by a persuasive human"], [364, "A PARSON AT BAY. 356 voice, towards \" that serene and blessed mood \" of which the poet sings : \u2014 \" That blessed mood, In which the burden of the mystery, In which the heavy and the weary weight Of all this unintelligible world Is lightened.\" Presently he reached it ; the strange deep peace of the mood enfolded him, bringing with it that rush of almost prophetic vision which is its peculiar gift. It was as though a curtain, hitherto concealing a vast canvas \u2014 the picture of his life \u2014 were for a moment drawn aside, to show him how pitifully small was the corner which up till now had been open to his criticism. He now saw an infinite space of glowing colour stretching upward into unknown sky7-depths ; he felt himself caught up amongst its noble harmonies, looking back upon past grief-laden hours as upon a vanishing speck which the eye retains only by an effort. Even when the colours had faded and the moment of ecstasy passed, there remained a sense of abiding tranquillity. It seemed that he had passed through the worst that could befall, and had yet retained his integrity ; that, come what might, he had once and for all made his peace with God. His subdued exultation was akin to that which follows upon a narrow escape from death \u2014 sober of hue, with the shadow of a late despair resting upon it, yet none the less heart-easing, and trustable for its very sobrietv."], [365, "A PARSON AT BAY. 357 In this quiet mood, which had neither the fear fulness of great joy nor the restlessness of great expectation, he pushed forth into the open water, surrendering himself once more to the stream. A short spell of rapid drifting now brought him in sight of his own vicarage and church, and of the higher parts of Marsh village. He had been dreading the first sight of what would seem little better than a mock-home, but now found himself able to face it with calmness. Here, as he reflected, was the scene of labours which had not been all in vain. For years he had been, from his own point of view, a failure as a parish clergyman, his life had been \" as idle ore \" in his own sight ; but those late storms that had shaken him so sharply had somehow opened men's hearts to him. He had latterly made an impression which he hoped would not die quickly. Even if he held to his plans, which now seemed doubtful, he would be leaving the place at least one degree better than he had found it \u2014 a moderate record of achievement for a decade's work, truly, but enough to satisfy a man humbled by misfortune. The day seemed now to be changing once more, and the autumn season, after its brief relapse into seeming summer, to be reasserting itself. The air was still windless, but the shoulder of a dark nimbus was slowly pushing upwards behind the spire of Marsh church, cutting it out sharply, as though drawn in white chalk upon black paper. The banks on either side of him were changing also, willow trimmed meadows giving place to sombre marshy"], [366, "358 A PARSON AT BAY. levels, and bays of ooze around which redshanks and dotterel were strutting and pattering. The sound of the sea was in the air, though its breath was still unfelt. Presently he found himself paddling slowly under Marsh bridge and among the moorings of the fishing-boats, all of which had gone to sea, and which, if the present stagnant atmosphere held good, were likely to remain becalmed all night. It was here that he should have landed ; but the smooth sweep of the ebbing tide, and the peaceful gliding-by of famdiar objects, upon which his gaze seemed somehow to linger as though he were saying farewell to them, fitted his mood so well that he decided to row on to the Quay. Perhaps, too, he was disinclined to face the empty home yet awhile ; Maisie would be spending the day on the other side of Bavant, and the one servant had been given a holiday, so the house would be quite deserted and silent, though scarcely silent enough \u2014 too full, per chance, of sweet-voiced echoes. Rowing on a little faster, just to confirm his decision, he was soon abreast of the principal marsh creek, with its little foot-bridge, and with the quarry's mouth just visible in the heathery slope above. This space of marsh had no sinister meaning for him as yet ; it was a blank page, upon which his friends had as yet written no tale for him to read. Fate had dealt him some hard knocks, but, for the present, had spared him one sharp stroke. But had"], [367, "A PARSON AT BAY. 359 he not been so cut off from all the goings and comings of his neighbours latterly, this state of happy ignorance could not have lasted for long. It had been decided to tell him the truth as to that meeting between Aubrey and the American; he must be told, as they all insisted ; but Miss Crackan thorpe, who cared more for his welfare than many of those whose speech was softer, had laid her strict commands upon them all. Hers, she had resolved, should be the task, and a painful one it must cer tainly prove, of opening the simple parson's eyes. She intended, however, to await Aunt Mabel's de parture before stirring up such unpleasant matters ; nor would there be any danger in a little delay, for Mr. Otis, as was supposed, was away in town, and Miss Crackanthorpe meant to attack him the moment he returned, and by some means or other to get him out of the district, and thus to put a final stopper upon the unhappy scandal. Some thing must, of course, be said to the vicar, if only by way of warning for the future, but not all that certain kind friends deemed advisable, and that not until the wealthy aunt should be too far off to quarrel with Maisie, and Mr. Brockenhart should have had time to recover his balance after parting with the child. All unconscious of what was hanging over his head, Claud Brockenhart went steadily on past the marsh and the sandhills. The tide which bore him along was lessening fast, the ebb having nearly run itself out, and the roar of the bar was in his ears."], [368, "360 A PARSON AT BAY. The sound struck oddly upon him, for with this still air and feeble tide there should have been but a crisp murmur from the sandbanks outside. The deep hoarse boom seemed unaccountable. When he turned the corner of the sandhills, how ever, the mystery explained itself. A sea-fog was coming up, and, with it, as often happened in these parts, a heavy groundswell, which, upon ap proaching the shallows, rose in glittering ridges to crash sullenly down upon the sandy barriers on either side of the narrow channel's mouth. Passing from the wide shallow harbour into the narrows, he landed close to Old Keydock's house, sighing as he passed the empty black shell, and furtively peering through its open windows ; then climbed the last of the sandhills, and stood gazing seaward. A single sailing boat was rocking gently a httle distance beyond the bar ; further out, a topsail schooner lay becalmed in the glass-smooth bay. The bay was an old friend of his, and its present peculiar mood was the only one in which he found it really companionable. When swept by a winter storm, he found this sea no better than a roaring tyrant, having no kinship with the wind-blown human atoms who might be cringing about its margin ; whUe, in a gentle summer breeze, the blue bay would prattle to the pebbles in a feeble lisping way that soon palled on the hearer. But when, as now, the slow heaves of its breast came stealthily creeping shoreward out of the mist, the massive"], [369, "A PARSON AT BAY. 361 quietude, broken only by the measured thunder-roll of the surf, seemed to soothe, and awe, and satisfy. He watched the solemn gathering of each glassy ridge, the steepening of it, the marbling of its hollow by the white fragments of the last roller, the breathless pause as the shadow deepened, and then the tense nerves would tingle with its splitting crash, followed by the hissing rush of wrinkled shuddering foam. In such a mood Nature seems to have weight enough to impose herself upon a troubled mind ; she becomes something better than a mere listener, to whom a man may unbosom himself, without fear of check, perhaps, but also without hope of consolation. The solemnity and peace of the scene seemed especially to favour retrospection. As he gazed, the parson's thoughts went sliding back through his ten years' sojourn in the parish. Here, on this very sandhill, the newly appointed vicar had had his fiiist interview with Old Keylock. As the new parson came up the old smuggler was chuckling over Nan's attempts to look through an ancient telescope, while hard by stood Master Ulick, a bright-faced lad just free from Eton, chaffing the child and the old man by turns. The interview was a failure \u2014 the shy vicar, who had no child of his own then, failing even to make friends with the little girl. Claud Brockenhart was a different man now ; he could speak to a child-maiden in these latter days without frightening her into"], [370, "362 A PARSON AT BAY. silence ; and there was a lifelong hunger in his heart that might haply serve as a passport to the friendship of most parents. Well, the ten years had swallowed up the hale old man, as well as the bright lad and the prattling child ; and he, the looker-on who had envied their friendship and affection, was left to play out his part on a stage whose lights had gone out. He would face his allotted task, and gather up the fragments of his life ; but its mainspring had run down, and, the materials for passion being all used up, there could be no more drama. So it seemed : yet the very quietude of the scene, emphasized rather than broken by the slow recurrent surf-thunder, contained a fiercely throb bing heart. There was a drama being enacted before his eyes at this moment, and one in which he was destined soon to take a part. Far away on the gazer's right, on the level sand beneath the cliffs, was a solitary figure \u2014 a mere grey speck in the distance to his eyes, but none the less a living, trembling woman, \u2014 one who was watching the bay with a gaze very different from his, whose straining eyes had never left it for a moment since the dainty little sloop that was now just beyond the bar had come round the eastern horn of the bay. The little craft had brought a breeze with her then ; but this had died away soon afterwards, leaving her to drift helplessly, on different veins of tide. The two men who formed her crew \u2014 the one, a"], [371, "A PARSON AT BAY. 363 paid hand, the other, a gentleman whose name the reader will not need to be told, were at present out in their punt, trying to tow the craft westward ; though, as the last of the channel ebb, striking upon the outer half of the reef, caused a strong backwater alongshore, they could make no appreciable way. \" No use, sir,\" the paid hand observed, when they had been striving fruitlessly for some time ; \" I told 'ee 'twould be of no use : and anyway we couldn't get ashore, even in the sheltered bight under the cliffs, now the groundswell has got so heavy.\" \" There'll be a puff of wind out of that big cloud soon, I suppose ? \" muttered Otis, sullenly resting upon his oar. \" Ay, but that'll be a puff from the west'ard \u2014 a dead head wind for us\u2014 an' not like to last neather, wi' them thunder-clouds about ; we shan't fetch Kimmersham for hours, if we do afore dark. When we was gettin' under way this mornin', you'll mind, I sez, ' The wind'll fall light long afore noon,' I sez, ' and happen we shall fetch into a glass calm \" Oh, d \u2014 n your talk ! \" put in the gentleman, savagely ; \" put me aboard again : then, if a puff comes, we can run the Snowdrop up the channel, and I can go ashore anywhere I please.\" Mr. Otis, who, as we have seen, was understood to be in London, had lately been putting up at a seaside hamlet a few miles to the east of the Quay. He had several times during the last week or two"], [372, "A PARSON AT BAY. 364 made the passage to Kimmersham without a hitch of any kind. All the rehearsals had gone smoothly, yet now the play seemed likely to prove a fiasco. Instead of gliding quietly off with Maisie to the tiny seaport, he would have to make some fresh, crudely hasty arrangement. It would be necessary somehow or other to extract her from the heart of a district where every soul knew her and not a few would be watching her movements suspiciously. At any rate there should be no more delay : he was heartdy sick of the slinking life that he had been obliged to lead lately. Moreover, Maisie's husband was to be back to-night, and might not be leaving home again for some time. While these thoughts were passing through the artist's mind, Maisie's husband was, in fact, watching his movements. Otis was not recognizable at this distance, but the parson, stretched at full length upon the sandy ridge, and following the impulse by which human eyes inevitably turn from inanimate nature to anything that lives and moves, was dreamily regarding the man\u0153uvres of the sloop's two hands. He saw the two figures climb on board, and one of them throw himself impatiently7 down by the helm, and wondered idly what step they would take next. There was not a breath of air as yet ; the creamy canvas rippled slightly, and a shimmer of white reflections came gliding like oil over the slow heaves of water as the shallow craft gently rose and"], [373, "A PARSON AT BAY. 365 fell. The rhythmic motion was pleasant to look upon, and it was difficult to realize that those smooth breasts of water should, as they came shore ward, and met the resistance of the sandbanks, rise into threatening walls and line the coast with their foam. Out in the offing the schooner was still becalmed ; all the eastward half of the bay towards the lean brown headland that made its boundary was of a deep soft blue, while towards the reef and beyond it cliff and sand and water had taken the leaden hue of the coming storm. The distant speck under the cliffs was enlarging itself as the figure moved east ward with the sloop, which was now drifting slowly back along its former course. Presently the looker on felt a cool shadow creep over him, and, raising his eyes, perceived that the western cloud-bank had risen high enough to obscure the sun. A moment later, the first puff from the west filled the sloop's canvas and sent her slipping quickly along with the boom off her quarter. She was soon abreast of the red buoy, when they at once bore up and headed her for the bar. The parson now rose to his feet, and began to watch her with increased interest. He saw that she was a shallow-hulled little craft, probably one of the local centre-boarders that were built mainly for speed and lightness ; and it needed but little sea-instinct to realize that, should she attempt to cross the bar without plenty of way on, a following swell might easily overtake and swamp her."], [374, "366 A PARSON AT BAY. Apparently, too, there was a difference of opinion on board : one of the figures seemed by his attitude and gesticulations to be remonstrating with the other. But nothing came of this ; she held on her course with sheets flattened in and bowsprit pointed for the channel. Feeling vaguely uneasy about the craft, Claud Brockenhart walked down to Keylock's landing place, where he had left his skiff. He would have been glad to consult one of the fishermen as to the situation of the approaching sloop, but the boats, like those of his own village, were all at sea, and not a creature visible upon the Quay, save two lads who were fishing with hand lines, though not too deeply engaged to bawl out impertinent remarks upon his watermanship, as he stepped into the skiff and shoved off. He decided, at any rate, to row some way down the channel, and see how the strangers fared. The ebb having now run itself out, the water in the channel was slack and unruffled. At the bend, however, where it turned south-eastward, he found himself, though still in smooth water, within a stone's throw of the white turmoil on the seaward banks. There he paused, to take a glance over his shoulder at the sailing-boat. She was making good way7 at this moment, and bending a little to the light breeze ; but, even as he looked, she came suddenly upright, the treacherous puff had already blown itself out. \" Get your oars out and pull,\" he shouted ; \" you"], [375, "A PARSON AT BAY. 367 must get way on her ! \" But the noise of the surf would have drowned a louder shout than he was capable of. As the craft drifted helplessly, a long smooth swell came stealthily chasing her : then, shortened by the banks, its form altered ; it rose high and steep, curled over, and broke just short of the boat, drenching her crew with spray. Now, at any rate, their danger was obvious : the helmsman started to his feet, and some hasty attempt was made to get oars out. But, when another short puff came, both men returned to pull confusedly at the sheets. \" The oars, the oars ! \" shouted the parson again, as he dipped his own sculls and shot down to the very verge of the smooth water. The breaking seas were thundering on either side of him now : one of them, striking the bank slantwise, sent a swirl of foam-clots over it and into the quiet channel. The tide was turning. He could not hope to maintain his present position more than a few moments. Meanwhile the great cloud-bank had mounted to the zenith, and from out the west came a low rumble of thunder. But the approaching storm seemed only to cheer and energize the occupant of the skiff. After the many moods he had gone through, he was now passing into one of almost mad exultation : before he had time even to wonder at his state, a fever of excitement seemed to have got possession of him. Hastily snatching the clothes from his back, he sat"], [376, "368 A PARSON AT BAY. waiting, with breast and shoulders bare to the chill squall which now came out of the belly of the thunder-cloud. As this squall struck the sailing-boat, she bent low to it, though both sheets were slack ; then gathered way, and promised to be in smooth water immediately. But a heavy surge was close at her heels, and, curling up over the helmsman's head in a gleaming arch, it crashed down full upon the doomed craft. She staggered for a moment before settling down ; then threw up her head like a hving thing in the death-throe, and disappeared under a sheet of foam. The parson drove his skiff forward with vehement strokes, so that, in a few seconds, her sharp stem was cleaving the sheet of foam into which the green roller had settled. But, half-smooth though it was, this was too much for the cockleshell : she drove her stem under it, and sank like a stone. Claud Brockenhart was a practised swimmer, and full of the vigour which excitement lends. He struck out strongly, with his head well up, peering eagerly round for the shipwrecked pair. Both men had got clear of the sinking sloop, and were being driven forward by the now-rising tide. One looked like keeping his head above water, though his struggles showed him to be an in different swimmer ; the other was evidently sinking, and but just able to send forth a gasping cry for help. To the latter the parson swam with all his ruio-ht \u2022"], [377, "A PARSON AT BAY. 369 and, getting behind him to avoid the wild grasping hands, seized the drowning man by the head, after a fashion learnt in old school days. Then, throwing himself upon his back and swimming strongly, he towed him steadily up the channel, helped by the growing flood. Edging away to one side of the channel, he was soon able to touch bottom ; where upon, thrusting his burden through the shallow water until the man was half lying upon the sandbank, he started again immediately. But the swimmer had this time to battle against the eager pressure of the flood. The strain began to tell heavily upon him ; the vigour of his stroke was failing, his breath came shorter and shorter. He had swallowed hardly a mouthful of food since yesterday, and was worn out by the stress of prolonged emotion ; it was clear that his short spurt of energy had well-nigh run itself out. There was little hope of saving the other man ; still be kept stubbornly on. The swimmer was still struggling feebly ; but the advancing sea was breaking well into the channel now, and, when the next wall of water uprose but a fathom or two from him, the man's courage broke up. With a scream of agony he threw up his arms, and sank to rise no more. The intending rescuer, with the cry of despair ringing loudly in his ears, turned on his back again, and allowed himself to drift up with the tide. He had saved a life, but all the spirit had gone from him. As he was borne along, the great clouds hung 24"], [378, "370 A PARSON AT BAY. sullenly above his upturned face, and the crash of thunder filled the western half of the sky from horizon to zenith. As he neared the bank, the man whom he had borne into safety stepped hastUy into the shallow, took the exhausted swimmer in his arms, and laid him gently upon the dry sand. \" Lie there quietly a bit,\" said a familiar voice in his ear, \" and you'll soon recover.\" \" I fear so,\" murmured the parson, faintly, \" I fear so. Otis looked with a kind of terror at the limp figure, which lay, still as death, exactly as he had placed it, the shoulders and arms gleaming whitely against the brown sand. If this man, after saving the life of one who so little deserved any boon at his hands, were to die, Otis felt that it would be more than he could bear. What could he do? \u2014 how could he revive the sinking man ? He would have given half his wealth at this moment for a small quantum of medical knowledge. He threw himself upon the sand, supporting the weak frame upon his knees, and vigorously rubbing the chilled breast and shoulders. While so engaged he heard the splash of oars, ancl a muttered \" Thank God ! \" escaped him. But it was only the two lads who had been fishing from the Quay, and, upon witnessing the disaster, had jumped into the nearest boat and rowed swiftly down the channel. They now landed upon the"], [379, "A PARSON AT BAY. 371 sandbank, and stood staring stupidly at the American and his burden. \" Don't stand there,\" cried Otis, hurriedly. \" Row back \u2014 row back, lads, as hard as you can lay blade to water, and fetch brandy, and a blanket to wrap him in. It's Mr. Brockenhart, and I fear he's dying of exhaustiou or collapse. Strip off your guernseys first, and lay them over him ; my soaked clothes are of no use. . . . There, now go \u2014 and bring the first man you can find back with you \u2014 and tell the women to send up to the village for a doctor.\" \" The men be all away fishin', sir ; there be only old Tom Culmer to home, and he'm in bed with the rheumatiz.\" With this the lads made off, and in a trice were driving their boat quay-wards. Otis felt that his burden was alive, but hardly more than alive. He threw open his clothes, and held the cold frame to his own warm body. The head fell forward upon his shoulder: it seemed that the fluttering life might pass at any moment. \" Oh, for God's sake, make an effort ! \" he whispered ; \" don't let yourself sink away for want of an effort of will ! You've given me my life, Brockenhart \u2014 don't leave me to groan through it burdened with shame. I've been a false, treacherous friend to you : but my treachery has been a torture to me. I've always cared for you. We might have been as brothers, but for \u2014 for my accursed wrong-doing. Try to live, if only to forgive me for that \" But the voice of his yearning appeal was unheard,"], [380, "372 A PARSON AT BAY. The limp figure lay in his arms, motionless \u2014 almost pulseless. The lads returned quickly with brandy and warm clothes ; and, as they could be of no use on the spot, Otis ordered them off to the village, telling them to go straight to Mr. Tucker at the Stone Curlew, who would himself gallop off for a doctor. Before they left, Otis managed with their help to get the sinking man to swallow a little brandy. His heart fluttered with hope at the faint signs of revival which then showed themselves. In a few moments the parson's lips were moving, and a hint of colour was stealing back to his face. Otis thanked God aloud, renewing his instructions to the lads with fresh hopefulness. The intensity of his desire had so kindled them that they made off over the sandhills as swiftly and eagerly as he could have wished. Presently the parson's lips moved, and Otis bent to catch his feeble whisper. \" The Little Thing must be with her aunt by now \u2014 on board, I expect ? \" \" You haven't let her go yet ? \u2014 she was to be with you another fortnight ! \" \"Yes \u2014 I've said good-bye to the Little Thing. Robert took her from me at the station. It was better so. Bob always stood my friend.\" \" 0 God, that we should have chosen this day of all others ! \" muttered the other, with a bursting sigh. \" Listen, Brockenhart, you must drink a little more brandy. . . . There, you're getting stronger."], [381, "A PARSON AT BAY. 373 you see. Do you remember how I restored you that morning at the Castle, when you came to warn me about Keylock ? \" \" Yes, I remember ; and I wished you might be standing by me when my time came to \" \" Hush, man, hush !

And listen, your brother and my sister care for each other ; my treachery to you has kept them apart \u2014 nothing else. You shall see them happily married ; and Phil will be rich enough to help you. You shall keep little Charmie, do you hear ? It shall be in no one's power to rob you again.

From afar off she had seen the sail ing-boat go down, and the skiff shooting forward to meet it ; and, until the last few moments, when she drew near enough to recognize Otis, had not known whether he was alive or dead. \" Are you saved ? \" she gasped, as she tottered forward, with great staring eyes and dead-white cheeks. \"It were better if I had been drowned,\" he muttered hoarsely. \" Who is that ? \u2014 whom are you holding ? \" \"No one,\" whispered the artist, brokenly, while his tears fell upon the face that lay peacefully against his heart. \" He has escaped us ; we have no power to hurt him any more, or to make any amends to him, or win his forgiveness ! \" It was even so. The rain-storm, which seemed to have waited until this moment to descend, came hurtling down upon a Tenement of Clay, from which the weary spirit had passed into a land whither no human message could follow it.
