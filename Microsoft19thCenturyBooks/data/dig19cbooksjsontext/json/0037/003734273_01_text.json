Fifty years have passed since the emanci pation of the United States. This lapse of time has solved two great questions. It has exposed the fallacy of human calcu lations, which anticipated only present anarchy and ultimate dissolution for the new Republics, and it has established the possibility of a people governing them selves, and being prosperous and happy. Their political infancy is over, they have approached to manhood ; and fully sensible of their strength, their first magistrate has ventured to utter the important words in his message of 1823, \" That notwithstanding their neutrality they would consider any attempt on the part of European powers to extend their system to any portion of the transatlantic hemisphere as dangerous to"], [12, "VI PREFACE. its peace and safety, and that they could not admit of any attempt at colonisation on the part of Europe.\" Thus for the first time they have advanced, taking a part de facto in the great political transactions of Europe, and pronouncing their declara tion in a tone which has certainly contri buted to the abandonment of most of those intentions which were fast ripening into execution. Great has been the influence of American liberty throughout the civilized world. The French, and more recently the South Ame rican revolutions, and the commotions in Spain, Portugal, Naples, and in Piedmont, owe their origin not to any instigation on the part of the United States, but to the influence of their example in raising the standard of freedom, and more than all, to the success which crowned their efforts. On the other hand, great has been the influence of European politics on the Ame rican nation. A party existing since the revolution, and extending its ramifications"], [13, "PREFACE. VII over the whole United States, is now grow ing into importance, and guided by the principles of European diplomacy, is root ing itself deeper and deeper, drawing with in its circle the wealthy, the dissatisfied, and thus adding every day to its strength. We see, in short, the principle of monarch ism developing itself in the United States ; and though it is not attempted to establish it by means of a revolution which would assuredly fail, there is a design to bring it about by that cunning, cautious, and I may add, American way, which must eventually succeed, unless the spirit of freedom be sufficiently powerful to overrule these sub tle preparations. There have been many changes in the United States within the last ten years. The present rulers have succeeded in so amalgamating opinions, that whatever may be said to the contrary, only two parties are now existing there\u2014 the Monarchists or the Governors, and the Republicans who are the governed."], [14, "PREFACE.

INTRODUCTORY REVIEW OF THE POLITICAL, PHYSICAL, AND MORAL STATE OF THE UNION OF NORTH AMERICA The progress of the United States, during the fifty years of their political existence, is unpa- ralleled in the history of nations. Thirteen states have increased to twenty-four, two millions and a half of inhabitants to eleven millions. The public revenues, which in 1784 were scarcely six millions of dollars, are now twenty-five millions. The navy, from the very lowest beginning, com mands the respect, and excites the jealousy of the power which has hitherto been the ruler of the ocean. Upwards of a thousand steam and merchant vessels, surpassing in velocity those of every other nation, are daily importing the pro ducts of the most distant countries, and diffusing B"], [20, "2 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. I. them through the interior of the Union, by means of rivers, navigable for thousands of miles*. A single state (New York) has com pleted what is unexampled in the Old World, China alone excepted, a canal, three hundred and sixty miles in length. Another state (Ohio) will have finished, in the course of next year, a second canal, three hundred miles long, thus establishing an artificial water communication of nearly three thousand miles, beyond all com parison the most extensive on the face of the earth. Above thirty other canals are in pro gress, among them the Pennsylvania and the Che sapeake, the former partly finished, and scarcely yielding in length to that of New York. To crown the whole, the national debt amounts * About twelve years ago there arrived at Leghorn, a ship, built at Pittsburgh, and cleared out from that place. The master presented his papers to the Custom-house officers, who would not give credit to them, insisting that the papers must have been forged, as there was no such a port as Pittsburgh, and accordingly the vessel was to be confiscated. The captain laid before the officer a map of the United States, directed his attention to the Gulf of Mexico, pointed out the mouth of the Mississippi, led him a thousand miles up the mouth of the Ohio, and from thence another thousand miles up to Pittsburgh : \" This, Sir, is the port from whence my vessel has cleared out.\" The astonished officer would as soon have believed that it had been navigated from the moon."], [21, "3 Chap. I.] OF NORTH AMERICA. to no more than seventy-four millions of dollars, and is rapidly diminishing. The clergy is with out tithes, and peace and tranquillity prevail without a secret police and without an army. It would not be difficult to trace the causes which have contributed to raise the Union of North America to this astonishing height of prosperity. A sea-coast of three thousand miles, excellent harbours, important rivers, rising and emptying themselves in its territory, a rich virgin soil, a temperate climate, a population composed of the descendants of the first nation in the world, the sciences of the ancient, the experience of modern times transplanted into a new and sus ceptible soil, and both united to the most liberal constitution that ever existed, were certainly ele ments which, well-employed and well-directed, afforded reason to anticipate future greatness. The Union happily found a genius fully com petent to give it this direction in \u2014 Washington. Ever the same at home, in the field and in the cabinet, he imperceptibly gave to the nation the impress of his character and his politics. A character more firm, more composed, and, not withstanding its simplicity, more dignified, than this statesman's can scarcely be imagined. There B"], [22, "4 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. I. never existed a man who knew the true interest of his country better than Washington, or sought it in a simpler or wiser way. His farewell address bears ample testimony to his unbounded patriotism, and will ever be the noblest document of his great and enlightened mind. The experience of his long and splendid career is, as it were, compressed into a few words, and recommended with a warmth of feeling, of which many thought him incapable, and which may be attributed to the thorough conviction, that through the adoption of those principles alone his country could be happy. So true are the principles he lays down in this celebrated document, so wise the maxims he recommends, that the Union and their President cannot desert those counsels, without risking their welfare, and even their political existence. To the adoption of Washington's maxims, the United States are undoubtedly, in a great mea sure, indebted for their present unexampled pros perity. \" The great rule of conduct for us,\" says this great statesman, \" in regard to foreign nations, is, in extending our commercial rela tions, to have with them as little political con nexion as possible. So far as we have already"], [23, "Chap. I.] OF NORTH AMERICA. 5 formed engagements, let them be fulfilled. Here let us stop. It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world. The inducements of interests for observing that conduct will best be referred to your own reflections and experience. With me a predominant motive has been to endeavour to gain time to our country to settle and mature its recent institutions, and to progress without in terruption to that degree of strength and con sistency, which is necessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own fortune. This was the road recommended by him as the only one by which they and their young republic could attain that degree of power and wealth which now furnishes so interesting a spectacle to mankind. Washington's successor (Adams), having dif ferent views, pursued a different track. His party (the Tories), his distinguished family-connexions, and important public services, elevated him to the post which Washington had occupied. Having manifested extraordinary zeal against Great Bri tain during the revolutionary war, these effer vescences of a callous and ambitious mind were mistaken by the republican party (the Federalists"], [24, "6 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. 1. and Democrats) for signs of genuine republican ism. The nation, however, had very soon an opportunity of convincing itself that the hatred he bore to England had no other source than his being under its government a mere colonist, and his zeal no other aim than to make his party the rulers of the people, and himself and his family the head of that party. It is not without horror that the American Democrats dwell on the scenes of 1798\u20141801, when the tyranny of the black cockades rendered the difference between them and the Spartan Helots only a name. Happily for the United States, his government was not of long duration. Mr. Adams followed rather too closely the example of the First Consul, and de clared, in too unequivocal a manner, his intention of domineering. The oppression and the insults which the Democrats had to endure at this time became so intolerable, and the infringement of their rights so daring, as to excite general dis content. Sedition-laws, arrests, imprisonments, and gibbets, only augmented the evil. Pennsyl vania gave the signal for general revolt, which was prevented only by the dismissal of the Pre sident. The Johns have never furnished high specimens of a prudent government. The Eng-"], [25, "7 Chap. I.J OF NORTH AMERICA. lish John lost his dominions, the French his liberty, the Bohemian his life, and the American his second election. Jefferson, Madison, Mon roe, whatever any of their opponents may object against their party principles, were men whose memory ought to be cherished by the people of the United States. What Monroe was \u2014 the so roughly treated Monroe \u2014 they have already felt, and are likely to feel still more, in the present dearth of statesmen. John Bull has now the satisfaction of knowing that brother Jonathan, who prided himself not a little in having, as he fancied, servants in lieu of Magistrates, has already become the dupe of his second-hand honourables, and is moreover in a pretty fair way of being put, by their well-meant endea vours, on an equal footing with the rest of the world."], [26, "8 [S hap. I THE UNITED STATES Chapter II. Election of the President, 1824, Among the four candidates for the Presidency in 1824, the Caucus candidate, as he was called, Mr. Crawford, was the only one fit, in every respect, to succeed to the chair once filled by Washington. Less splendid than solid in his political career, as a member of Congress, a senator, an ambassador, and Secretary of the Treasury, he expressed himself unequivocally in behalf of the system hitherto pursued, and gave the fairest expectation of his persevering in the principles of Washington. Unhappily, however, under the last three Presidents enormous abuses had crept into the administration ; creatures of the reigning party were appointed to all offices, almost to the exclusion of the rest of the nation. Re sponsibility was wholly out of the question. The arrears in the post-department alone amounted to many hundred thousand dollars. It was deemed expedient to deviate from the existing mode of accepting the Presidents from the hands of Con gress, and high time to annul a privilege which"], [27, "Chap. 1.) OF NORTH AMERICA. 9 that assembly seemed already to claim as a right. The Democrats formed an opposition, in conser quence, against Mr. Crawford, the candidate of the democratic party, which was joined by most of the democratic states. Virginia, so much fa voured by the present state of things, together with Georgia, the native state of Crawford, adhered to the Secretary of the Treasury, not choosing to desert .him, even when his prospects became hopeless. The second democratic candidate was Mr. Jack son, Senator of the United States, and Major- General. He was considered as the head of the Radicals, who expected from his powerful hand a thorough reform of the administration \u2014 that is to say, a change of the magistrates and officers, the chastisement of the Tories, correction of abuses ; among the rest, of the enormous army of 5,800 men, and of the navy, then consisting of seven ships of the line ; a reduction of tbe public expenditure for fortification, &c. The Pennsyl vanians, so fond of the saving principles, joined the General, as did their neighbours, the people of Ohio. The Southern States conceived themselves indebted to Jackson for his gallant defence at New Orleans, and therefore considered it their duty to"], [28, "10 [Chap. II. THE UNITED STATES adhere to him. All the place-hunters in the Union formed the rear-guard of the second candidate. The Secretaryship was regarded as the usual road to the Presidency. Mr. John Quincy Adams was then Secretary of State : his party consisted of the six New England States. A finished edu cation, an intimate acquaintance with the belles lettres, a high character as a diplomatist, an ele gant style as an author, and the important office of Secretary of State, attracted to his party the fashionables throughout the Union; and New York, for this reason, gave up Crawford and Jack son, and joined Adams's party, which might be considered as the very antipodes of Jackson's, wishing for a more respectable navy and army, a higher tone towards foreign powers, and the like. Mr. Henry Clay, Speaker of the House of Re presentatives, had also announced himself as a candidate : his party consisted of the people of Kentucky, Missouri, &c; at the time, however, he cared less about securing the Presidency for himself than obtaining the election of a President who was most likely to serve his interests, and those of his party : to carry every measure by his party, and to ensure his own elevation at the next election, was his object. The States of Kentucky"], [29, "11 Chap. IL] OF NORTH AMERICA. and Missouri had expressed their desire to their constituents, to have their votes given to Andrew Jackson, in case Clay should not have any chance of succeeding to the Presidency ; for they had every reason to expect a more ready concurrence in their views and interests from Jackson, as se nator for Tennessee, than from any other of the candidates. Clay promised obedience to the order of his constituents. Of these four candidates, Crawford obtained from Virginia and Georgia forty-two votes ; Jack son from Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and the Southern States, ninety-nine ; Adams, from the New England States, New York, &c, eighty four ; and Clay, from Kentucky, Missouri, &c, thirty-six votes *. None of these four candidates having the con stitutional majority of votes, the election devolved on the House of Representatives, before whom the three former candidates, Crawford, Jackson, and Adams, were brought, agreeably to the law of election, Clay being excluded. * In the case where no candidate has two- thirds of the whole votes viz. (261), the Constitution declares that the election de volves upon the House of Representatives, before which the three candidates are to be brought who have the most votes in the gene ral election. Each State has then one vote, and the absolute majority, i. e. 13, makes the election valid."], [30, "12 [Chap. II. THE UNITED STATES The will of the people was manifested in^too clear a manner to admit of any doubt, or to afford cause for any uneasiness respecting the issue of the election. A disappointment was thought the less probable, as the rivalship, or rather enmity of Clay and Adams, since the Treaty of Ghent, was notorious, and the severe attacks of the former in the House of Representatives were still in remem brance. What added to this security \"was, that the majority of votes was for Jackson : expec tation was, however, disappointed, and the pride of the sovereign people of the United States could scarcely be more humbled than by the use made by their representatives of their delegated power. Similar views and principles made Adams and his party a compact body, who understood each other perfectly, and acted on the same principles. Besides being united, this party, consisting chiefly of Yankees *, had the advantage of supe rior information and talents, with what is always the case with the Yankee \u2014 a proportionate addi tion of trick and artifice. Great cunning was, however, not requisite to outwit Jackson's party ; for the honest, but phlegmatic Germans thought * In order to obviate misunderstandings, we think proper to state that, under the appellation Yankees, we mean the inhabi tants of the six New England States."], [31, "13 Chap. II. ] OF NORTH AMERICA. it sufficient to cling to their leader, as their an cestors did in days of old to their chieftains. The States whose votes were divided between Adams and Jackson were induced, without great effort, to join the party of Adams, who, in consequence, obtained an equality of votes with Jackson, but no majority. The party of Crawford kept themselves in the background, without listening either to the insi nuations of Jackson's or Adams's party. Clay, who at first chose likewise to stand neuter, now deemed it the proper time to step forward, and to assume the part of mediator ; his adherents, as we mentioned, were Kehtuckians : the credit of the Kentuckians is not very firm. A certain fashion able way of life, gambling, races, state bankrupt cies, land speculations, an inveterate propensity to the bottle, have caused much disorder in the financial circumstances of these gentlemen : even the honourable Speaker, Mr. Clay, was not thought quite exempt from the general diseases of his State. There was but one remedy \u2014 to get Mr. Clay into the office of Secretary of State, and thus afford his faithful friends the means of retrieving their for tune and credit, by the gift of important offices. Accordingly, his supporters thought it necessary to reconnoitre the parties : a beginning was made"], [32, "14 [Chap. II. THE UNITED STATES with Mr. Jackson, who was asked what their master had to expect from the General, in case he should be elected by their co-operation. Either Jackson did not choose to deliver himself into the hands of Mr. Clay, or having no particular fancy for Mr. Clay, as Secretary of State, he declined making any offers. The Representatives of Ken tucky had been directed by their respective States to give their votes, in the present case, without any condition, to Jackson. To ensure their fidelity, they were obliged to act in accordance with the Speaker, whose enmity to Adams seemed to them the surest means of securing his election. Political enmities and friendships have this much in common, that their duration is just so long as the parties find it to suit their purposes. If the nation has no other guarantee for the fidelity of its servants, its interests are in bad hands : unfortunately there was none. The very circumstance which separated the po litical antagonists was the cause of their union \u2014 ambition. Mr. Adams and Mr. Clay found out and understood one another. The very men who but a week before bated each other most cordially, and never met except on public and unavoidable occasions, now spent whole nights together in a clandestine manner. In what light the nation"], [33, "Chap. IL] 15 OF NORTH AMERICA. would view these proceedings, on the part of men of their character, there could be no question : Adams and Clay had succeeded in dispelling the prejudices about the rights of the people. A formal bargain was concluded, which gave the nation for the term of four years into the hands of Mr. Adams. The stipulated price for which the Speaker bound himself to join Mr. Adams was the Secretaryship of State. This being agreed to, Mr. Clay, with his friends, went over to Mr. Adams and his party. In order to prepare the minds of his consti tuents, and to exculpate himself for his accession to the party of Adams, Clay addressed a letter to Colonel W , in Kentucky, desiring it to be published, expressing his scruples in regard to Jackson, and the necessity of declaring for Adams. The subsequent election gave to Crawford four votes, to Jackson seven, and to Adams thirteen votes, and, of course, the Presidency. To describe the temper of the nation after these events is scarcely in my power. The suppressed malicious smile of the Tories, who dared not ma nifest their mischievous joy at their victory ; the republican Federalist doubtfully shaking his head at the triumph of a party which not many years"], [34, "[Chap. IL 16 THE UNITED STATES hefore actually intended to sell their country ; the simple Democrat who had but an obscure idea of the whole proceedings, and was unable to comprehend how the great gentlemen could have been so blind as to prefer a Tory to the second Washington (Jackson) ; the Radicals, finally, who had conceived, from Jackson's elevation, very sanguine hopes respecting offices, and now saw themselves so cruelly disappointed, loudly de nouncing treachery, and crying out for civil war \u2014 such were the scenes that might everywhere be witnessed. The power which the law certainly exercises upon the citizen of the United States (at least the northern) was, on this occasion, seen to advantage. Notwithstanding the disappoint ment of his fondest hopes, he attempted not the least opposition to the object of his hatred, who was now elected his first magistrate. There were several exhibitions and illuminations, at which Mr. Clay was hung, and afterwards burnt in effigy, while John Adams was mentioned in rather less honourable terms ; but that was all. Tbe nation expected further light, and ob tained it. The first glimpse of the proceedings between Messrs. Adams and Clay was obtained through a"], [35, "17 Chap. IL] OF NORTH AMERICA. letter written by Mr. Cramer, member of Con gress from the state of Pennsylvania, which ap peared in the Colombian Observer, and alluded to nightly interviews held at Washington, between Messrs. Adams, Clay, and their parties. Clay, to whom a printed copy of this letter was sent, answered in a truly Kentuckian style, in the most abusive language and with a challenge, at the same time citing Cramer before the House of Representatives. Cramer declined appearing before this as sembly. He was not, however, a man calcu lated to unravel the intricacies of this plot, or to make head against the two gentlemen (Adams and Clay), and the whole proceeding terminated in a manner puerile and discreditable to the Penn sylvanian members of Congress. Clay, however, notwithstanding the superior talents which cannot be denied him, was little sensible of the inconsistency of which he was guilty in publishing his circular to his constitu ents, or he would have known that the very tone of mind in which he composed this letter, was his strongest accuser. Nothing but the Kentuc kian arrogance, with which he looks down upon the military chieftain, Jackson, and the ineffable c"], [36, "[Chap. II- 18 THE UNITED STATES contempt with which he treats the effusions of popular discontent in the smaller towns, could equal the treachery to the people, of which he was accused. The correspondence occasioned by this letter of Mr. Clay, and the reminis cences which it now revived in the minds of the honourable members, needed nothing more than confirmation on the part of Mr. Adams himself, who was not backward in giving it, and in thus stating the price for which the first magistracy was obtained."], [37, "19 Chip III] OF NORTH AMERICA. Chapter III. John Quincy Adams, President of the United States \u2014 The Nation. John Quincy Adams was already unpopular on his father's account. Introduced at an early period into the most important public offices, he became accustomed to look down upon the peo ple. A Tory by birth and by education, he is as staunch as his father ; but with less mental capacity he is infinitely more dangerous. His father's political errors and the embassies of London, St. Petersburgh, and Paris, were the schools in which he was trained ; cold, circum spect, and free from passion, he disregards the censures as well as the approbation of the peo ple, above whom he considers himself elevated. This pride or rather arrogance, is a family fail ing, and so little is he able to suppress it, that previously to his elevation, and while yet but a candidate, he so far forgot himself as to threaten an officer of the Bank, who presumed to con sider his indorsement as no better than that of another citizen, with the full weight of his dis- C 2"], [38, "20 [Chap. III- THE UNITED STATES pleasure. In private life he seems anxious to conceal this passion under the mask of repub lican carelessness, and a certain nonchalance. His countenance betrays a cold ambitious mind, his dark eye exhibits the heartless diplomatist. As a politician, he adopts the axiom that the means are justified by the end. Neither a Democrat nor a Federalist, he joined both parties, and left them as he found it best suited to bis interest. When Secretary of State he uttered the follow ing memorable words : \" The United States will not be ranked among nations till the Presidency becomes hereditary.\" When one of the repre sentatives was introduced to a nightly interview with him, and expressed his scruples respecting the manner of the election, the characteristic reply of Adams was, \" Sir, the time will come, even with the United States, when the govern ment, and not a prejudiced populace destitute of character, will determine the public opinion. The question is, whether you, Sir, are sensible of the importance and the advantages which must ne cessarily accrue to you from the present course, or whether you prefer the old system. \u2014 Your determination in regard to the election is deci sive.\""], [39, "21 Chap. III.] OF NORTH AMERICA. Adams is reputed by his party and the majority of the people, to possess a great mind : this is far from being the case. His talents are rather of an ordinary kind, but they are not the less dangerous on that account ; for it is not the greatest, but the coldest and most persevering statesman, alike in sensible to contempt and to praise, who is most obnoxious to the freedom of a nation. His style, a mixture of the elegant and the diplomatic, is admired, because it is new to the United States. It cannot be denied, that it is the most fit to disguise his political opinions and his deep-laid schemes. This motive and his predilection for everything coming from the eastern courts, may sufficiently account for his adoption of and fond ness for it. If taken upon the whole, he may be considered a most dangerous man to the freedom of the Union, and if he had been sent by Metternich himself, he could not pursue more closely the principles of the Holy Alliance*. It was to be presumed that the temper of the * This will, I hope, sufficiently account for the circumstance, that the editor of the Austrian Observer, who is private secretary to Prince Metternich, espouses on every occasion the party of Mr. Adams against the attacks of his political adversaries.

HI- 22 THE UNITED STATES nation towards the new President would be some what different from that which was manifested to wards his predecessors (his father excepted) ; not that the people expect to have a President chosen without the ordinary intrigues incident to elec tioneering. To these they are accustomed, and there will hardly be found a constable in the United States who obtains his petty office with out intrigues. But the manner in which the new President had obtruded himself upon the nation, bespoke such an utter disregard for the established and funda mental principle of the constitution \u2014 the sove reignty of the people, to whose will, its organs, the representatives, are bound to conform, was, through the price with which Adams purchased their treachery, so trampled upon, and so strongly attacked in its foundations, that the nation could not but be wholly alienated from him. The innate arrogance of Mr. Adams, always kept him aloof from the people. He never mingled with his fel low-citizens on equal terms. Pretty much in the manner of European grandees, who effect through their dependents what they think beneath their own sphere, he endeavoured to work upon them by his public journals. But as brother Jonathan is"], [41, "23 Chap. III.] OF NORTH AMERICA. not yet so happy as to have Washington grandees, and as he appreciates the heavy burden of sove reignty too well not to keep it on his own shoulders, the coup-de-main by which Adams endeavoured to ease him of this trouble, and, by the assistance of his followers and the honourable Speaker in his own cabinet, to settle his fate, was far from be ing looked upon with that deference and respect to which he was accustomed in his diplomatic career. The citizen of the United States is habituated to scrutinize with an innate distrust the measures of his administration, even when enjoying his con fidence. The Opposition generally take upon themselves this interested attention. Adams had no republican party in his favour ; his election was the work of the Monarchists and of his own genius. The nation, as was to be expected, has shrunk from such an union, and the better part is waiting with impatience for the moment which shall deliver it from an administration, from whose hostile tendency it cannot look for any measures but such as are both dangerous to its political freedom and to its general welfare.

Previously to his election, he caused the calumnies of Mr. Edwards, who accused Mr. Crawford of mismanagement in the treasury-department, to be inserted in the public papers then at his command. This was done in terms full of suspicion in regard to Craw ford. At the same time he endeavoured, by all possible means, to prevent the recall of the calum niator, who was on his way to Mexico. The new President had the magnanimity, as it was called by his party, to offer the Secretaryship of the Treasury to the very person whom he had not long before represented as an object of public suspicion, and in whose broken state of health and ruined hopes he had the greatest share. Crawford, in cold and dignified terms, declined the intended honour of serving under him in his former capa city, intimating in a rather unequivocal manner, that he would not have any connexion with the administration of Adams. The same office was subsequently offered to Mr. Clinton, Governor of New York, who refused it in a still colder and almost contemptuous man ner, quite in that lofty and cutting tone which Adams himself is so fond of employing. \" He values too highly the confidence of the people"], [43, "Chap.

The only public paper which encouraged re volutionary movements (the Columbian Observer J, was in a short time silenced, and discontinued by the most ardent friends of Jackson. The American citizen has inherited from his English ancestors, the respect due to the existing authorities and to himself.

But this does not hinder him from venting the feelings of his aversion on every op portunity. Last year a steam-boat was launched from the wharfs at Pittsburgh ; she was des tined to run between that place and New Orleans, and was to start immediately on her first trip. Thousands of people were collecting on the bank of the Ohio (Monongehela) ; trunks, barrels, and bales, lay ready for embarkation ; the passengers"], [44, "26 [Chap.

At length the veil was removed from the bust placed at the head of the vessel, and the name of the steam boat appeared in letters of gold a yard long. In less than five minutes, not a spectator, not a pas senger, not a trunk, not a barrel, not a bale, was to be seen : without uttering a word, the silent multitude had disappeared. The name of the steam-boat was Lady Adams, her bust, an ele gant piece of carving in princely costume with a diadem, was proudly displayed at the head of the vessel. The owner, who had a few days pre viously arrived from the south-west, and thought to give the good people of Pittsburgh an agree able surprise, found himself wofully disappointed, and he replaced the elegant figure by that of the martial- whiskered General Caffee ; and then only did passengers, bales, and barrels return, though not in half the number they had before presented themselves."], [45, "27 Chap.

The first measures of a new President are, his message to the Senate, the House of Representa tives and the nation, \u2014 the next the composition of his Cabinet. The nation had now little doubt respecting the proceedings at Washington, and spoke freely its sentiments, intimating, that it would regard the nomination of Mr. Clay to the office of Secretary of State, as an unquestionable proof of the truth of the accusations to which we have alluded, more especially as the character of Clay was so diametrically opposite to that of Adams, their enmity, till the week previously to the election, so notorious, and Clay, notwithstanding his talents, the last person upon whom Adams, if unfettered, would have fixed his choice. Regard for public opinion, and the offended feelings of"], [46, "[Chap- IV. 28 THE UNITED STATES the people, must necessarily have instigated Mr. Adams to another choice, if he had been at liberty ; but the Secretaryship of State was the price stipulated for the Presidency, and Mr. Clay thus became first minister. In his earlier life this gentleman was a lawyer in Kentucky, and he was afterwards chosen for his oratorical talents as representative for that State in Congress. In this capacity he distin guished himself by a nervous, a natural, and a practical eloquence \u2014 ad hominem. A quick pene tration, and a self-possession which scarcely any thing could disturb, procured him influence, and a daring presumption common to the Kentuc kians, gave him preponderance. Without clas sical education, he knows how to assail the weak part of human nature in a truly singular way. At an early period of his public life he voted against the interest of his constituents. After his return from Washington, he met everywhere with a cold reception. As if nothing had hap pened, he mingled with his neighbours : no one spoke to him ; he was shunned by all. Ap proaching an old friend of his, a respectable Kentucky farmer, he wished him a good day \" I thank you,\" was the reply. \" How d'ye you"], [47, "29 Chap.

In less than one hour the apropos allegory was in every one's mouth; \" Clay for ever!\" was voci ferated on every side, and he was again unani mously elected representative. As Plenipotentiary at the Treaty of Ghent he played rather an indifferent part, and quarrelled with Adams. The explanations promised by him to the nation, respecting Adams's conduct at Ghent, we are still waiting for. His influence became overbearing, and so much power did he possess over the minds of his fellow-representa tives, that there was little doubt of his being elected President, in case of his return to the house as one of the three candidates. His pecu liar talent consists in making himself popular with his State. In order to win his countrymen over to his interests, he plays as easily the part of the drunkard and the gambler, as in good com pany he can put on the gentleman. The Ken tuckian, however, is apparent, and his coarse im petuosity breaks forth on every occasion. This latter circumstance, so far from affecting his popu larity, renders him the idol of his countrymen. \" That is a mighty great man ! That is a wonder-"], [49, "Chap. IV.] OF NORTH AMERICA. 31 fully eminent man !\" That is the very first man in the Union, you may hear from every Kentuckian, and be knocked down if you should not be precisely of the same opinion. Clay has in his person very little that is attrac tive ; a disagreeable face, gray piercing eyes, full of a wild and malicious fire, distinguish the shrewd and impetuous politician, who knows no delicacy in the choice of his means. No other State but Kentucky would have forgiven Clay's breach of trust. The Kentuckians were angry only so long as they were unacquainted with the price of this job en gros \u2022 as soon as they had the opening prospect of offices from their coun tryman, the present Secretary of State, he again became their favourite. It is no small honour to the other States that they deeply feel the wound inflicted on the moral principle of the Republic, and accordingly hold its author in abomination. None of the twenty-two States would choose him under the present circum stances for a constable. His private life is far from being exemplary : a duellist and a gam bler, he has neither principle nor a sense of what is due to decorum. It is certainly shocking to see the Speaker of"], [50, "32 [Chap. IV. THE UNITED STATES the House of Representatives of the United States forget himself and his dignity, so far as to reply to an anonymous attack in a newspaper in the vilest terms, and with a challenge such as might have been given by a coachman. This, however, is his way of silencing his antagonists : for this reason Randolph had to fight him. I saw him in Cincinnati (Ohio) when a small number of friends gave him a public dinner against the sense of the majority of the people. Though he was perfectly aware of the utter abomination in which he was held by the inha bitants, his conduct was such as if nothing had happened. To shake hands with every one who offered, and to affect a cordiality, which, looking into his face, appeared rather to be a satire, gave him, in the eyes of the prudent Ohian, more the air of an impudent stage player. This hunting after popularity, these smiles and false hoods to no purpose, formed a scene more dis gusting than I should have expected from a man of Clay's standing and intellect. The post of Secretary of the Navy was filled by Mr. Southard, a man of a narrow mind, and so completely the tool of Mr. Adams, that he is certainly not a worthy subject of biography."], [51, "33 Chap. IV.] OF NORTH AMERICA. We shall confine ourselves to a short notice of this gentleman. Formerly a schoolmaster, then a lawyer, he performs the duties of his present office, in a manner which clearly shews that he has preserved only the very worst traits of his former professions. In whatever he does, an unaccountable odium attaches to his measures. The reappointment of the man who slew the noble-minded Decatur, of the man who disho nourably struck his flag to the enemy, and, though he consulted his personal safety, and retired to a foreign country during the war, was called to fill a post of honour in the United States' Navy, at once convinced the American nation, that shoot ing an adversary in cold blood and fidelity to wards Mr. Adams, were sufficient qualifications for advancement. This appointment was intended to effect the hu miliation of Commodore Porter. Whatever may have been the fault of this gentleman in feeling the affront done to the flag of the United States, and in releasing by force of arms his lieutenant, who had been put in prison by the Mayor of Porto rico, then a place of shelter for pirates, he was punished with more than ordinary severity, by being compelled to appear before a judge, D"], [52, "34 [Chap. IV. THE UNITED STATES who was prejudiced against him, and who an noyed him in a manner which must have been truly galling to the feelings of the open-hearted seaman. There is, in the naval Secretary, a striking peculiarity of character, which is very often to be found in low-minded men when raised to elevated stations. Their peevish souls delight in the infliction of every kind of torture they can devise against their betters. Porter felt so much humbled by questions calculated to lower him in the public opinion, and in his own, that he quitted the service in disgust. Rush, the Secretary of the Treasury, is a harm less man. Grateful for his promotion to an office which was declined by Crawford and Clin ton, he serves Mr. Adams with fidelity and zeal. He is a mere cipher in all respects, if we except the framing of the annual reports transmitted by him to the House of Representatives. Mr. Adams's object in making him Secretary of the Treasury, was merely to gratify the good people of Philadelphia, with whom, or rather with its Tories, Mr. Rush possesses great influence. Barbour, the Secretary of War, and Marshall, the Chief Justice, are men of exalted character, whatever may be their party principles. Of the"], [53, "35 Chap. IV.] OF NORTH AMERICA. five gentlemen I have named, Messrs. Clay and Southard may be considered as the instruments of the President, Rush as his faithful servant, and Barbour and Marshall as his ministers. The choice of Mr. Adams was such, that he silenced Federalists, Democrats, and Tories, and secured to himself all the power necessary for the execu tion of his schemes. This amalgamation of parties if continued, will produce more serious consequences than the United States are aware of. The President's Message. The nation was accustomed to find in the mes sage of its former Presidents, a solid and suc cinct account of its relations. The navy, the army, the roads, the posts, the resources, the wants of the State, every subject that interested and concerned the nation, was brought into re view, and the political measures to be adopted were represented in clear and distinct features. Such were the messages of former Presidents, such was that of Monroe ; and when the latter declared in his message of 1823, \" that the United States, notwithstanding their system of par tiality, would consider any attempt on the part of European powers to extend their views to any D 2"], [54, "36 [Chap. IV. THE UNITED STATES portion of this hemisphere, as dangerous to the peace and safety of the Union,\" Ssc\u2014 we see in this declaration the manly and dignified language of the chief of a Republic, who, sensible of its importance, abstains alike from raising premature pretensions, and from holding out empty threats ; we also see in it the free magistrate of a free country speaking his mind in plain terms, without art or cunning. Mr. Adams's message presents a striking contrast. We see a highly ornamented rhetorical production, which labours to disguise the ambitious schemes that are to be carried into effect. Instead of taking a review of the politi cal and economical state of the Union, it tells us that the executive must not be obstructed in its endeavours to carry into effect the plans and schemes which it considers to be expedient for the welfare of the nation. We hear of an observatory, desired by no one, and voyages of discovery which are impracticable. The minis ters of Napoleon or of Russia might have pro posed to their sovereigns such enterprises ; a candidate of the Parisian academy might have delivered a similar speech. A President of the United States should not be satisfied with pro ducing fine-sounding phrases, he has other ob-"], [55, "37 Chap. IV.] OF NORTH AMERICA. jects to attend to of a more important and press ing nature. In a new Republic, one half of whose territory is without bridges and without roads, where the most essential means of social intercourse are wanting, we can afford but little attention to the erection of an academy of fine arts and belles-lettres. I speak the language of experience ; for none can entertain greater esteem than I do for the arts and sciences, as well as for their protectors. But the Parisian academy, transplanted to Constantinople, would but vege tate like orange-trees confined to greenhouses. In the course of time America will have its sciences and arts as well as Europe ; - but it evinces an unpardonable short-sightedness in the chief of a commonwealth to dwell upon such topics, where so many other things are to be done, and where two-thirds of the Sovereigns of the United States (as they please to call them selves), have no glass in their window frames, and are obliged to transport the produce of their lands to the towns or mills on beasts of burden, for a space of from ten to twenty miles, through pathless woods and forests.

IV. 38 THE UNITED STATES their names, to attain a high rank among the great ones of the earth, and to be greeted by its monarchs as brothers \u2014 these were the failings of the father ; those of the son seem in their ten dency, to be still more ruinous to the Union. The father (John Adams) in his character of Vice President, brought a motion before the Senate, for changing the President's style and title from that of Excellency to that of Highness and Pro tector of our Liberties. The son is of opinion, that the United States will not dare to aspire to the rank of a nation of the first order, so long as the Presidency is not established for life, and of course hereditary in his family ; and he thinks it high time to organize an important army and navy, and to assume a more exalted tone in his intercourse with foreign powers. It was prin cipally with this object in view that Mr. Clay was directed to address a note to Mr. Middleton, the ambassador from the United States to the Court of St. Petersburgb, by which this gentleman was instructed to urge, in the most earnest terms, the interposition of the Russian Government, in order to bring about a termination of the war between Spain and its former colonies. This conduct on the part of Mr. Adams, reminds me"], [57, "39 Chap. IV.] OF NORTH AMERICA. of a newly-created baronet waiting with impa- tience the moment when his new coat-of-arms and his recently-acquired splendour are to be dis- played to the admiring world in the gorgeous pomp of a state carriage. What in the name of common sense could induce Mr. Adams and his new friend to take upon themselves the part of a second-hand mediator, and to send forth a heavy, tedious, and after all insignificant memo- rial to the Russian Cabinet ? Was it not more consistent with the status quo of the United States, to observe a prudent silence about affairs in which Messrs. Adams and Clay had no con- cern ? Was it not in the highest degree presump- tuous in them to assure the Russian Government of their being satisfied with the present posses- sors of Cuba and Portorico, and that they could not on the other hand remain passive spectators of their occupation by a foreign power? We forbear mentioning that this undiplomatic man- ner of determining with a third party, with re- spect to the possession of a second, savours a little of Buonaparte, and we shall only ask the simple question, What could the administration of the United States effect with their twelve ships of the line, and twice as many frigates, if"], [58, "[Chap. IV. 40 THE UNITED STATES Great Britain were to resolve upon occupying Cuba ? If Adams, instead of acting with humble arrogance through his organ Mr. Middleton, on the Court of Russia, had declared in his message, that the situation of the Southern States does not admit of the forcible occupation and revolution izing of Cuba on the part of the South American Republics, such a declaration would have borne at least a dignified character. The Russian minister further replies in his note, \" That justice, the law of nations, and the general interest in having the indisputable titles of sovereignty respected, could not allow the de terminations of the mother-country, in this im portant case, to be prejudged or anticipated, and that it will not, therefore, be possible for his Im perial Majesty to change principles in this nego tiation, nor to institute it separately ; and until positive information has been received of the ulterior views of Spain in regard to her American possessions, of her decision upon the proposition of the United States, and of the opinion of her allies in relation to the same subject, that, there fore, Russia cannot give a definitive answer.\" We hope that Adams will take the hint from this courteous but sufficiently intelligible lesson, that"], [59, "41 Chap. IV.] OF NORTH AMERICA. he may in future spare himself the assuming of the part of mediator, and he had better attend to his own affairs. As for Mr. Clay, the author of this specimen of Backwood diplomacy, the hint is lost upon him ; any insinuation in order to make an impression upon him, must be of a coarse nature, and then Mr. Nesselrode would incur the danger of being treated in a Kentuc kian, or, which is nearly the same thing, in a Cossack style. The conclusion of the Russian answer is, \" She (Russia) is however in the mean while, pleased to hope, that the United States (becoming every day more convinced of the evils and dangers that would result to Cuba and Por torico from a change of government, and being satisfied, as Mr. Clay has said in his despatch, with the present commercial legislation of these two islands) will use their influence in defeating, as far as may be in their power, every enterprise against those islands, and in securing to the rights of his Catholic Majesty, constant and proper respect.\" It shews how quickly the artful statesman (Nes selrode) understands the mode of directing these two inconsiderate statesmen in the course which they are expected to pursue.

The South American Republics are now in full possession of their liberty: their governments are acknowledged by the United States, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and to a certain extent by France. Spain does not possess a square mile of ground on the American Continent. Ex hausted by a long war, distracted by party spirit, impoverished beyond description, she sees the im possibility of continuing the contest any longer. She has no hope left but in the assistance of her allies, and in the counter-revolution of her former colonies.

V. case of civil commotions in the new Republics, of directing its operations accordingly. On the other hand, the republican form of the new States, is so little adapted to their popu lation, as to preclude all hope of its becoming permanent. When the United States of North America resolved to shake of the yoke of Great Britain, the population of these thirteen States were ripe for political emancipation. Descended from the freest nation of Europe, they fled to the wilderness in order to enjoy, unrestrained, their religious and political liberty. The mere shadow of oppression was to them insupportable ; and measures which in South America, or on the European Continent, would have been deemed rather a benefit than a grievance, occasioned in the United States a revolt at first, and afterwards a complete revolution. After six years' warfare, two millions and a half of people succeeded in obtaining, not so much by their physical as by their moral strength, perfect freedom and inde pendence from the control of the wealthiest and most powerful nation in the world. Quite dif ferent is the case with the new Republics of the South. The Spaniards came to America in quest of wealth, not of freedom : as soon as"], [63, "45 Chap. V.] OF NORTH AMERICA. they had attained their aim, they returned to the mother-country. Comparatively few respectable families re mained in the colonies. The majority of the Spaniards who emigrated to America, were adven turers and idlers, attracted and detained by the facility of earning a livelihood, and having no thing to lose in their own country. They mostly mixed with Negroes and Indians, and from this intercourse originated a motley population, half red, half -black, and half-yellow, whose mental accomplishments go pari passu with their faces. Religion and priests, or rather superstition and monks, are not fit instruments to nourish liberal and republican ideas ! The necessity of emanci pation, therefore, being only felt by the Creoles of the better class, very few at first joined the cry of independence ; few provinces took up arms, and even in these, only the minority of the population. It was not until the mother-country drove the colonists to despair by its impolitic measures and unprincipled cruelties, that revolt became more general. From the year 1808 to the year 1825, a population exceeding twenty millions of inhabi tants, favoured by their natural allies, climate, and disease, has been contending, with doubtful sue-"], [64, "[Chap. V. 46 THE UNITED STATES cess, against an enemy whose strength was daily diminishing, and who had to derive its scanty resources from a distance of four thousand miles ; and it was not until 1825, that the issue of the battle at the Ayacucho decided the contest in favour of South American independence. The new Republics are no doubt emancipated from the yoke of the mother-country, but there is yet wanting the first principles requisite to the formation and maintenance of a free common- wealth \u2014 a population whose elements are such as to admit of its being virtually represented, and thereby to ensure durability to their republican institutions. At present the power is in the hands of the Generals who secured the Repub- lican Independence, Bolivar, Paez, &c, some of whom wield the powers intrusted to them with sovereign sway, and want nothing to complete the character but the title. The Congresses of the different new States are composed of Creoles of the better class, and of priests and Spaniards who declared themselves for the new order of things \u2014 all creatures of these despots. The proportion of the white to the yellow, red, and black population, in most of the new Republics, is as one to ten, and of this tenth not"], [65, "47 Chap. V.] OF NORTH AMERICA. more than half can be considered as capable of taking part in the political affairs of the State. The rest of the community are sunk in indolence, poverty, ignorance, and sloth, little differing from the negroes, by whom indeed they are excelled in point of industry. To expect a representation taken from all the elements of which the popula tion is composed, and thereby to diffuse a propor tionate jurisdiction among all classes of society, would be an idle chimera. The Mestizo, Mulatto, Negro, and Indian, may indeed be called free, but nothing more. Superstition, bigotry, and igno rance, render them the dupes of their priests, who, with one eye turned towards Rome and Spain, the other towards their new rulers, have already shewn the extent of their dominion, by the es tablishment of the Roman Catholic faith, as the religion to which every inhabitant is bound to pay homage, and by allowing nothing more than an insecure toleration to other creeds. The dissensions, and even civil wars that are spring ing up in the Republics, are a clear indication of the fate which sooner or later awaits them. Sanguinary and violent in character, the Spanish race is not born for freedom : they must either subdue or be subdued. Whether the Mulattoes,"], [66, "48 [Chap. V. THE UNITED STATES Mestizoes, Indians, or Negroes, will eventually submit to the yoke of their masters, time alone will reveal. Where, however, the latter race constitute the majority, it is to be feared that we may witness a crisis which will terminate the power of the Spanish descendants, by a ca tastrophe that will be a signal revenge for all the horrors committed by their ancestors. That the present dictators, in the plenitude of their power, are not without apprehension for the future, is sufficiently obvious. To these fears, or to the desire and necessity of uniting together for the maintenance of the present order of things, the Congress of Panama, now the Con gress of Mexico, is indebted for its convocation. Spain is erroneously supposed to be the occasion of this Congress, just in the same manner as ten years ago France was said to have occasioned the Holy Alliance, though the one as well as the other had ceased to be in an attitude to excite alarm. The point of view in which the United States have to consider this Congress, is so simple and so manifest, that it does not require the intellect of a statesman, but a mere common understand ing to comprehend it. That the new Republic would not be backward"], [67, "Chap. V.] OF NORTH AMERICA. 49 in their endeavours to engage the United States in their interest, was to be foreseen, so it was not less natural, that their invitation should be attended to, and that directions should be given to their accredited ministers already sent to the new Re publics, to repair to the appointed place of meet ing. Great Britain had done the same in regard to European Congresses. If, however, the Presi dent of the United States has the intention of forming an alliance with, or of putting himself at the head of the new States, a measure for the accomplishment of which preliminary steps have undoubtedly been taken (as still more forcibly appear from his message, from the tone in which he fancies himself to soar above Washington's policy, and from the enthusiastic sympathy which he seems to feel in the fate and fortunes of South America), nothing but the circumstance of having future sovereignty in view, can account for such an infatuation in a statesman, who is fully conscious, that, by pursuing it, he endan gers the very Union. When Monroe, in his message of 1823, de clared \"that the United States would consider any attempt on the part of the European powers to extend their system to any portion of this hemi- E"], [68, "50 [Chap. V. THE UNITED STATES sphere as dangerous to our peace and safety\" there was then every reason to apprehend an armed interference of the Holy Alliance in South American affairs. Spain, at the time alluded to, still possessed armies and strong holds on the American Continent : a timely and powerful succour on the part of the Holy Alliance, and especially of France, would have been likely to decide the contest in her favour. This is not the case at the present time. The Spanish armies are no more ; they have been annihilated or taken prisoners ; their fortresses are in the hands of the new States. The manly and well timed declaration of Mr. Monroe, combined with that of England, had the desired effect of ope rating as a salutary check against the intentions of the Holy Alliance. The re-conquest of the South American States by Spain, even with the assistance of the Holy Alliance, is an event no longer to be apprehended. The independence of South America is secured against Europe. The same position which was assumed by England with respect to the Holy Alliance and their Congresses, is the proper position of the United States against their antipodes, the military Republics of the"], [69, "Chap. V.] 51 OF NORTH AMERICA. south, composed of the elements of the Spanish character. As the King of England -could not have made common cause with the Powers of Europe after the fall of Napoleon, without dis regarding the fundamental principles of the English constitution, so the administration of the United States cannot form closer engage ments with the Republics of the south, with out violating the foundation of the principle of North American liberty, \u2014 the Sovereignty of the people. The form of these Republics, as they call them- selves, is a military oligarchy. The sovereignty is not in the people, but in the government, or rather in the dictator. Sooner or later they will become monarchical: religion, education, character, all conduce to this end. The establish- ment of such a form of government, has only been prevented by the hatred in which the mo- narchical system has been hitherto held. Time and the influence of the priests will soften that hatred, and prepare the way ; and if Mr. Adams, who is notorious for never having acknowledged the sovereignty of the people, is permitted to join this confederacy, the United States are most likely to reap the same effects from this E 2"], [70, "[Chap. V. 52 THE UNITED STATES unholy compact, as the nations of Europe have experienced from their Holy Alliance. The position of the United States, in regard to foreign powers, becomes no less critical. They place themselves at the head of a union, in direct op position to the Old World, taking part against it, and even against Great Britain, which maintains a strict neutrality. When a country embarks in a new measure of so much delicacy and hazard, it is not in its power to say how far it may or may not justly provoke a third nation to acts of hostility. How long the good understanding of these powers will continue, is uncertain ; and it is very questionable whether this demonstration of arrogance, in putting themselves at the head of South American affairs, will not provoke the jealousy of Great Britain. If the United States came out of the last war with honour, they may thank their Perrys, their Bainbridges, and their Jacksons, though the miniature victories of these leaders were but a small compensation for the blows inflicted by their opponents. That the Union was not dissolved, may be ascribed to Madison. The same success cannot be expected from an administration raised by the assistance of the very party, which in the last war thought"], [71, "Chap. V.] 53 OF NORTH AMERICA. it more to their interest to join the New England States to Canada, and to sell themselves to Great Britain, in order to save their commerce. It is quite incomprehensible why the nation should be exposed to such dangers for the sake of an alliance with States, which were as much under the control of Monroe, as the Holy Alliance is under that of Great Britain. The United States have at no time assumed a higher station, nor spoken in a more dignified tone, than under Monroe, whose well-timed moderation was blended with a due regard to the nation's charac- ter and honour. This commanding elevation has been abandoned by the present, administra- tion for an unnatural alliance with Republics, which, from their religion, manners, and situa- tion, must ever hate the superiority and detest the principles of the United States, and are des- tined by nature to become their antagonists. That the Spanish character will never harmonize with that of the descendants of the English, may be seen from the conduct of the Mexican Go vernment. At the time when the Government of Mexico called upon the administration of the United States to fulfil the memorable pledge given by the President in his message to Con-"], [72, "[Chap. V. 54 THE UNITED STATES gress (1823), they declined to ratify a commercial treaty formed on the basis of reciprocity, be cause, as they candidly confessed, this treaty would prevent them from assisting their brethren of the south in case of a war. This treaty has since been concluded ; but we may infer from these, and from several other vexatious proceed ings of the Mexican authorities towards mer chant vessels, what the United States, have to expect. A war may take place with all these new Republics ; with Mexico it is inevitable, and will happen perhaps sooner than may be imagined. The present administration, by its parental care, has the merit of instructing these Republics in the secret of their strength, and of furnishing them with a pretext for exert ing it. The reason why Great Britain is so highly interested in the welfare of these coun tries, is quite obvious ; they are her natural allies against the United States, and it is con sistent with her policy to foster them. But when we see the United States' Government, who are not unacquainted with the character of these people, cherishing these gigantic military Re publics with so much affection, this appears to us a degree of inconsistency absolutely unpar-"], [73, "Chap.

Nothing can be less solid, nothing can offer less security for the future, than the bond of the Union itself. A vast unwieldy body, held together only by motives of self-interest and of egotism. \u2014 One of the most important ques tions which attacks the foundation of this very egotism in its vital parts, and widens every hour more and more the distance between the South ern and the Northern States, is the possession of slaves. It is not a mere party-question ; the whole population are opposed to each other, and the steps taken by the government in regard to this essential point, are watched by the southern people with a jealousy which is almost incredible. Happily for the Union four of the Presidents were citizens of Slave States, and, therefore, treated the point in question with corresponding delicacy, leaving it to time to remedy the evil. It was for this reason that the Republic of Hayti has not been acknowledged, notwithstanding the clamour of the north, which was afraid of suffer ing in its commercial interests by the refusal. It was argued, and not without reason, that such an acknowledgment could not but create in the"], [74, "[Chap. V. 56 THE UNITED STATES southern black population, a tendency to renew their sanguinary attempts. From the same cause, the Southern States of the Union are so adverse to an alliance with the Southern Re publics, which latter are about to place all races and colours upon the same footing, for the pur pose of effecting a combination of so many con flicting elements. If Mr. Adams would have listened to the voice of the people, and acted according to their interest, he would not have produced so much excite ment by his message. The minister to Mexico or Columbia could have repaired to the Isthmus, have conveyed to the assembled plenipotentiaries the assurance of friendship, and have received such communications in return, as they were pleased to make. They might also have gone charged with a solemn protest against the invasion of Cuba: these were the steps which a sound policy dic tated. In this manner Spain would not have been unnecessarily offended, nor the jealousy of Great Britain excited, in a manner which is now manifesting itself: thus the system of neutrality, hitherto pursued for the welfare of the Union would not have been infringed. If, on the contrary, the President declares in his message, \" that the"], [75, "Chap. V.] 57 OF NORTH AMERICA. policy of Washington could not be applied to the present circumstances,\" this evasive declara tion leaves but little doubt as to his deep-laid schemes. Time will prove that it is particularly to the South of America that Washington's policy ought to be applied without reserve. Those new Republics are destined to give the United States, sooner or later, more trouble than all the rest of the world put together. A wise policy would keep them at a proper distance, as long and as effectually as possible. This would have been the system dictated by wisdom, and founded on the status quo of the Union, on the neutrality and on the delicate situation of the Southern States. \u2014 One reflection forces itself upon the thinking observer. \u2014 When a man suc ceeds, as Mr. Adams has done, in placing him self at the head of affairs, it ought certainly to be expected, that he would take such conciliatory measures as were likely to heal the deep wounds inflicted upon the feelings of the nation, and by no means to proclaim sentiments which must necessarily confirm the idea that he inclined to wards monarchy. This was the course naturally to be expected from a man so well versed in diplomacy, who, moreover, has the warning ex-"], [76, "58 [Chap. V. THE UNITED STATES ample of his late father before his eyes. If the new President on the contrary, avows without disguise, in his first as well as in his last message, the intention of stretching his power to the ut most; if he does what even the Sovereign of Great Britain would not venture to do, appoint a Secretary of State, and support a man so wholly unpopular as Mr. Clay ; if he dare not only to de clare his intention to recede from the system hitherto pursued, but to maintain that declara tion in opposition to the manifest feeling and interest of the nation; if he constitute himself the sole umpire of its internal and foreign rela tions, without even condescending to consult its opinion ; if he assume toward the Senators and Representatives of a sovereign state, a tone be fitting a monarch* only; then arises the ques tion, whether such a man is not, de facto, a * Last year a postmaster was to be appointed at Nashville.

It would be under-rating Mr. Adams's talents, to presume that he is not sufficiently aware of his own strength to enforce the sugges tions of a fanciful and an ambitious mind. He is now again at the head of the party which so evidently proved to the Union in 1812, that they were tired of the Republican Constitution. He renounced them at that time, because they wanted to range themselves, not under his ban ners, but under those of Great Britain. At pre sent he is again in union with them ; they are lite rally his phalanx, himself their chief. By means of this party, he has all the New England States, and part of New York and New Jersey on his side. In both these latter States, as well as in Vir ginia, public opinion amongst the higher classes declares itself almost openly for monarchical go vernment. To what extent corruption and de pravity have arrived in the west, the Presi dent's election has made manifest. Daily expe rience tells us how patiently the nation submits. What are we not to expect from a man who is endowed with a sufficient stock of calculating"], [78, "60 [Chap. V. THE UNITED STATES prudence to wait for time and tide? The United States are approaching to a crisis which will decide whether the republican or the monarchi cal government is eventually to prevail. If Mr. Adams should be capable of maintaining his ground at the next election for the President's chair in 1828, then the nation may be justly said to have lost all sense of honour and of liberty, and to be sufficiently tamed for the yoke. It will then be as ripe for the blow, as the Romans were with their expiring liberty, and without any violent convulsion, Mr. Adams may pursue the measures which he and his party have prepared for his usurpation and his eventual accession to a throne. No doubt then remains about the fate of the northern divisions. Its separation from the Southern and Western States with an hereditary President, perhaps a crowned head to govern it, will be the natural consequence. The veil will be then removed, and we shall be able to discover why the same Mr. Adams, who opposed so strenuously, when Secretary of State, the ac knowledgement of the South American Repub lics, is become at once their most enthusiastic defender at the risk of incurring the irreconci lable hatred of the Southern States of the Union."], [79, "Chap.

It would be injustice to the nation to assert that it is an indifferent spectator of these proceedings. It is fully sensible of the injury done, and the most distinguished men of the south and west, have combined to avenge it, directing their attacks against the present administration. But they have not succeeded in giving the nation a clear idea of its real situation, and of the views entertained by its present leaders : they only discover in the last election of the President, the corruption of Mr. Clay. He is the object of all their hatred, and he is treated by the members of the Opposi tion like the stone which the dog is eager to seize, forgetting the hand which set it in motion. \u2014 In their opinion, for the breach of trust committed by the Speaker and some of the representatives, the whole House is to be punished, and the election of President is in no case to be left to its deci sion.

It is with constitutions as with paper-money, the more that is added, the more it becomes depreciated in value and in credit. Whether this paper bulwark would be strong enough to resist the combined attacks of Mr. Adams and his party, is very doubtful. It is not from the form of the law of election, neither is it from the Speaker, were he even a Clay, nor from the House of Representatives, that the United States can have grounds for future fear. Clay, with all his depravity, and that of his Kentuckians, would not have effected anything with Crawford, nor even with Jackson, because they respect public opinion. The coup d'eclat of Mr. Clay, bears so much the character of depravity on the face of it, that it is certainly doing him too much honour to change the law of election on his account, and to make him the only object of attack. The man who answers such attacks, no matter whether made in the Senate or in the newspaper, in language both scurrilous and abusive, will have influence only in Kentucky.

But to observe most rigorously the laws of de corum, and to be a strict economist, though at the expense of a poor mantua-maker ; to keep the statutes inviolate, neither to ride nor to play, nor to indulge in the least pastime on a Sabbath, but to study in silent meditation how on Monday to deprive a neighbour and fellow-citizen of his pro perty or his liberty ; to be liberal towards ministers; to have no religion ; not to be put out of coun tenance by the most sarcastic attacks of an adver sary, but to wait with Christian patience, until the opportunity offers for revenge in a diplo matic style \u2014 this is what we must do if we desire to obtain a character for steadiness with brother Jonathan. Our prototype in the north is Jacob, who robbed Esau of bis birthright : and in this similarity of character with the descendants of Jacob, we may find the key to the rare and sincere attachment of the northern people to so consummate a leader as Mr. Adams. The south does not admire this half-monkish, half-hebrew turn of mind ; but to complete the parallel, resembles old Isaac, who in his blindness directed his whole attention to the goat-skin, if it be not improper to call Mr."], [82, "64 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. VI. Clay by so soft a name. Thus as Jacob of yore conspired with his mother against Esau and Isaac, so Adams with his party pursue their road un molested, and establish their empire while the spectators are thinking him a cipher or the crea ture of Mr. Clay. \u2014 The best and most intelligent men of the Union, and even the shrewd Ran dolph, have fallen into this unpardonable and dangerous error. It cannot be reconciled with sound reason to suppose, that Mr. Adams, who is superior to Mr. Clay, if not in point of talents, certainly in firmness, political foresight, and discretion, should yield to this gentleman and become his tool. How little he cared for this person, he sufficiently proved at Ghent, and when Secretary of State, by his indifference to the most sarcastic attacks upon him by Clay, then Speaker of the House. Mr. Adams, con sistent as he has always been, has not changed since, and if he seems to retire for some time to the back ground, he has certainly his reasons, amongst which may be considered his endeavour to work underhand with his party, and throw most of the public odium on his Secretary.

The transaction being thus concluded, the dele gates were at liberty to return to their homes. But they considered that so fair an opportunity of declaring their opinion of the present ad ministration ought not to be lost ; they framed two resolutions, which passed by a majority of ninety-eight votes to seven : the first expressing their disapprobation of the election of Adams, and of the present administration of the United States ; the second was a virtual nomination of General Andrew Jackson for the next Presi dency (in 1828). To the administration these proceedings were a blow as severe as it had been unforeseen, the more so as Tennessee, scarcely four months after Mr. Adams's election, had also nominated Mr. Jackson for the ensuing Pre sidency. The question is now, whether the State of Virginia has sufficient republican strength left to induce it to sacrifice the monopoly which it has hitherto exercised. From this State, and from the family of Adams, the six Presidents have been chosen. The ordinary road to this office was considered to be through that of the Secre-"], [87, "Chap. VI] 69 OF NORTH AMERICA. tary of State, as the road to the latter is the embassy to London, Paris, or St. Petersburgh, all of which were obtained through relationship or a close connexion with the President. Thus the first magistracy has become in a certain degree a family fief, and through the family of Adams, is likely to change into a monarchy, and through Virginia, into an oligarchy. The offices depend ing upon the administration, were beset either with the friends of the Adams's family, or by the followers of the Virginia party. This was and is the case with supreme judges, with post-masters, collectors of sea-ports, &c. The rest of the States, though not entirely excluded, had but little share in the administration : this is now on the eve of alteration. Mr. Jackson is neither Secretary of State, nor a friend to either party ; he is, as it were, a novus homo, who, to speak the truth, has neither pleased the Virginians nor the Tories. Whether Virginia will be so magnani mous as to give up her hitherto exercised privi lege for the sake of the general liberty, and to join a party through which her influence over the administration is likely to suffer, is the great question, upon the determination of which the freedom of the people most unquestionably de-"], [88, "70 [Chap VI.

If Virginia, to preserve her presidental monopoly, should try again to form a party of her own at the next election, then Mr. Adams will certainly succeed, and the foundation of a monarchical government will thus be laid. If Virginia and Georgia should unite with Pennsyl vania, not only the republican party may be con sidered as triumphant, but the preponderance of their principles, under the guidance of Jackson, will necessarily produce a reform, and a salutary riddance of that evil, which, during the course of fifty years, has eaten into the very heart of the Union."], [89, "71 Chap. VII.] OF NORTH AMERICA. Chapter VII. Major-General Andrew Jackson. Never, perhaps, has public opinion been so di vided about any man as it is about General Jackson. Whilst the one party (Adams's) de scribes him as a tyrant, a military chieftain, a lawless soldier, the other represents him as a hero surpassing Washington himself. He is at the head of the Opposition, and the ruling power has, therefore, as much reason to depreciate him, as his own party has to extol him to the skies. The first view of Andrew Jackson is imposing, but the impression he leaves is not an agreeable one. A stature above the common size ; a body which fatigues and hardships have cleared of all superfluous flesh ; a physiognomy indicating violent passions ; a face furrowed by deep lines ; a grayish piercing eye bespeaking less of shrewd ness than of impetuosity, and which age has not robbed of its fire ; these, with a tincture of Irish cunning, are the peculiarities that distinguish the present hero of the Opposition. He lost his"], [90, "72 [Chap. VII. THE UNITED STATES father in early life, and was thrown, when an orphan of fourteen, into the vortex of the re volutionary war. Having been taken prisoner, he rescued himself with a firmness of purpose, seldom to be met with at his age. His predilec tion for a military life may be dated from this .early period. Shortly afterwards he gave himself up to the study of the law : a curious incident laid the foundation of his fame. On a journey from his residence to a distant county-town, where the quarter sessions of the court were to be held, he met a farmer, whose sorrowful countenance seemed to indicate that his affairs bore a no less sorrowful aspect. By his natural power of per suasion, he soon learned the cause of the farmer's grief \u2014 a hopeless lawsuit \u2014 Jackson inquired more particularly into the matter, and asked his companion if he would permit him to plead his cause. The farmer, casting a side glance at Jackson's wretched pony, and at the still more wretched rider, expressed his disbelief of his power to be useful in this case, adding, that the first-rate lawyers could not give him any hope : but at last he consented. The issue of the trial was at hand ; the farmer's counsel was pleading ; the counsel of the opposite party as well as the"], [91, "Chap. VII.] 73 OF NORTH AMERICA. jury were about to retire. \" Stop gentlemen,\" ex claimed our young lawyer presenting himself at the bar in front of the presiding judge, and exhibiting his license : he was allowed to plead accordingly. In less than fifteen minutes he succeeded in rivet tingthe attention of the judges,jury,and assembly, all equally astonished at the forcible address of a peasant, who made his first appearance dressed in a home-made coat, with a linen bag thrown over his shoulders containing provisions for him self and his horse. The jury retired, the verdict was pronounced, the farmer recovered his pro perty, and the young lawyer gained a name and clients. He was afterwards appointed President- Judge of the Quarter Sessions, which station he filled with honour to himself, though he resigned it at a later period, as well as other offices which he then held. His military passion led him to take the command of a body of militia destined against the Indians. The character of a war with these tribes is well known, and though, perhaps, insignificant in the eye of an European general, it is so full of dangers and hardships, that none but those who have travelled through the backwoods, the scenes of such wars, can form any competent idea of their nature. Only"], [92, "74 [Chap. VII. THE UNITED STATES an American can bear these fatigues, and fol low an enemy through swamps and trackless woods, who is seen and disappears at the same moment, and is close at the heels of his foe when supposed to be far distant. The Indian never attacks in the open field, thinking it the greatest folly to expose himself. To do this, even should he vanquish his enemy face to face, would rather subject him to degradation in the eyes of his brethren, than be productive of glory to him. Concealed behind trees, or under cover of bushes and rocks, these people send forth their deadly weapons, or fire at their foes. If they have not the shelter of a cavern, they throw them selves down in the grass, and are thus hidden from view. Their food consists of the Calabash and a bundle of maize flour ; their weapons are the tomahawk, and now generally a gun. They travel with surprising swiftness through forty or fifty miles of country ; they prefer making nightly attacks, and in this kind of warfare they are exceedingly expert. It is a well-known fact, that in one of the recent wars, the nation of the Sioux travelled above three hundred miles in order to surprise their enemies, who, fancying themselves secure, were off their guard: few"], [93, "75 Chap. VII.] OF NORTH AMERICA. escaped the tomahawk. Jackson knew the cha racter of his opponents, and fought them in their own way. After an unwearied pursuit from one lurking place to another, he found them at last, and forced them to a stand. During one of these pursuits the brigadier and his corps fell short of provisions ; most of the troops murmured, not excepting the officers, and all desired to return home. Jackson, informed of this discontent, sent his officers an invitation to breakfast with him on the following day. Surprised at such an invitation, the officers made their appearance at the hour appointed, their curiosity much excited by the projected entertainment. A great quan tity of acorns were spread on the floor of the hut, which was formed of branches ; the general was seated on the ground. When his guests en tered, he rose, and pointing to the acorns, civilly said to them, \" Gentlemen, as long as we have these we have no reason to complain of want of food : let us sit down.\" Without further cere mony he resumed his place, and began to eat this strange repast. The officers made many wry faces, but were obliged to munch the acorns as no roast beef was to be had. Jackson's perseverance was crowned with sue-"], [94, "76 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. VII. cess : he charged the Indians, and put them to flight. On another occasion, part of his troops made serious preparations to return home. Jack son instantly summoned his officers, and selected such troops as he could rely upon; he then ordered a line to be formed, declaring, at the same time, that those who would attempt to desert him should be summarily shot. His arbitrary con duct on this and other occasions, is severely cen sured, not only by his enemies, but even by his impartial friends. If General Jackson compelled his men to remain with him after their term of service had expired, this act can by no means be justified. Deficient as the militia regulations may be, so long as they are not altered by a legal enact ment, no general whatever has a right to strain the military duty of any citizen beyond its bounds. The serious mischief resulting to the common wealth from such a violation of the liberty of a citizen, cannot be counterbalanced by the most splendid victories. There is as little excuse for his conduct towards Governor Troup of Georgia: but if in this instance he abused his power, and that he did is beyond a doubt, why was he not arraigned? Why vindicate him publicly from the accusation, thereby approving of his conduct ?"], [95, "Chap. VII.] 77 OF NORTH AMERICA. In this case, the circumstance that since the time of the revolutionary war, he had been almost the only one who eventually humbled the Indians and inspired them with greater respect for the United States, even this should not have pleaded in his favour. On the breaking out of the last war with Great Britain, we find Jackson holding the rank of Major-general at the military station of New Orleans, the capital of Louisiana. Before the British effected a landing in Louisiana, he had chastised the Seminola Indians, who were insti gated to hostilities against the United States. He had taken Pensacola, and, after a feeble re sistance, put the Spanish troops to flight, toge ther with the civil and military authorities of the the place, and returned with the rapidity of an eagle to New Orleans. The war against Great Britain was carried on as might have been expected from so discordant a body, whose unwieldy mass was directed by nineteen different heads. Washington was burnt ; the Tories declared against the war, and even against the government, and the Union was on the brink of dissolution. In a city mostly inha bited by foreigners of a doubtful character, Jack-"], [96, "78 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. VII. son fancied himself surrounded by traitors, and thought it incumbent upon him to secure his post. He proclaimed martial law as soon as the British landed in the State of Louisiana. The inhabitants of this State are not considered by the rest of the Union in the most favourable light. Louisiana is looked upon as a property acquired by purchase, in regard to which every- thing is allowable : the conduct of Jackson was in accordance with this notion. The Creoles, eager to prove themselves worthy their newly- acquired citizenship, freely made Jackson an offer of their own services, of their slaves, and of their property for the defence of their country. Jack- son accepted these offers with the indiscreet hauteur of a man in power. As long as the legislature was sitting, he allowed the inhabitants to pur- sue their business without molestation, but no sooner had the Assembly adjourned, than he civilly requested those subject to military duty either to form a corps, or to take officers' com missions. When they protested against this, he sent a company of soldiers as the shortest way of putting an end to all resistance. Towards foreigners he acted in a still more summary manner. There were about fifty French-"], [97, "Chap. VII.] OF NORTH AMERICA. 79 men of distinction at this time in New Orleans, who were invited to take up arms against the invader. They declined the invitation, alleging in excuse, the peace concluded and ratified be tween Great Britain and France, and called his attention to the fate which would await them if they should be taken prisoners. \" Well, Gen tlemen, you must either fight or quit the city, for we have no occupation for such as you ; it is not the time for courting and making love now.\" This was Jackson's reply ; and without further ceremony they were conveyed to Natchez, three hundred miles above New Orleans. One of the most respectable foreigners refused to quit the town, or even to fight, giving as a reason that he had no landed property. \" But you have cotton,\" replied Jackson. \" Yes Sir.\" \" How many bales ?\" \" About three thousand.\" \" Well, Sir, if you will not help us to kill our enemies, you will not refuse to assist in protecting us.\" The mer chant not understanding the meaning of these aphorisms, Jackson explained them by taking a thousand bales. Hesitation was of no avail. The thousand bales were afterwards returned to the owner. The bashful Creole was astounded at this conduct, which did not savour much of republi-"], [98, "80 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. VII. canistn, and the foreigner had no remedy. But these arbitrary proceedings did not succeed with his fellow-citizens. Jackson caused one of them who refused to comply with his orders to be ar rested without a warrant. Judge N set him at liberty. Jackson, in return, had them both ar rested and imprisoned. At the restoration of peace he was arraigned before the court, tried and sentenced to a fine of two thousand dollars. The inhabitants of New Orleans generously offered to pay it for him. \"Gentlemen, I have sinned, and must bear the punishment,\" was Jackson's reply. There is in him a strange as sociation of arbitrary violence united to repub lican equality. The same person who could act in a manner approaching to tyranny against Tories, and persons whose patriotism admits of doubt, treats the poorest militia-man as his equal. \u2014 One of his neighbours, a Tennesee farmer, who came with the troops from that State, wished to speak to him. He was introduced, and Jackson walking up to him, desired him to sit down, and ordered two glasses of brandy. They drank to each other's health, and of course destruction to the invaders. \" Well, Joe, what brings you to me ?\" \u2014 \" General, I wish you would let me go"], [99, "\u00abhap VII.] 81 OF NORTH AMERICA. home again.\" \" And why dear boy ?\"\u2014 \" Why, they always call me Nasty Joe, and you know I cannot bear nicknames ; but to tell you the truth I want to see what my wife and my family are doing.\" \" Well, Joe, then we will go together.\" \" Why, General, what do you mean ?\" \" You know, Joe, they used to call me Hickory *, and like you, I am tired of nicknames, and to tell you the truth, I want also to see how things are going on in old Tennessee.\" \" Why, General you cannot leave your station you know.\" \" Yes, that is true ; but can you Joe ?\" Joe scratching his head was for a moment silent. \" Well, Joe,\" concluded Jackson, \" I will tell you what we will do, we will stay here awhile, and after we have done our duty we will return together, and let them have the satisfaction of calling us what names they please.\" Joe seemed satisfied, and went away.

A company of militia-men wanted to return home two days before the attack, their time of service having expired. Jackson was apprized of their intention, and ordered them to form in line of battle. \" Gentlemen,\" said he, \" you are not going to leave us now ?\" \" Yes, General, our"], [101, "Chap. VII.] OF NORTH AMERICA. 83 time of service has expired.\" \" Well,\" exclaimed the General, advancing a few steps, \" Attention ! Shoulder ! March !\" A company of riflemen posted with fixed bayonets and loaded muskets in their rear, left them no choice of the road they were to take, and they moved on in silence to wards the batteries. The result of the attack on the 8th of January, is well known, but it is to be hoped that two nations equally united by the common ties of blood and interest, will never more be engaged against each other in a destructive war. The more unexpected the fortunate result of this con test, the greater was the joy of the inhabitants and of the whole nation. From this day Jackson became the man of the people. He afterwards repeatedly fought and routed the Indians, and compelled them to agree to the terms prescribed. His quarrel with Governor Troup of Georgia, and the atrocious execution of Arbuthnot and of his companion occurred about this time. The legislature of his own State, Tennessee, appointed him a senator of Congress, and afterwards in 1827, he was nomi nated by that State a candidate for the Presi- G 2"], [102, "[Chap.

During the contest and election, he behaved in an upright and dignified manner, taking no particular steps to secure his election and bearing his subse quent disappointment and the success of Adams, with a calmness of mind Jittle expected of him. He returned with his lady to his plantation, two miles from Nashville, where he is respected by his fellow-citizens, and leads an independent life upon an annual income of ten thousand dollars : he has since resigned the senatorial chair. According to the assurance of well-informed and impartial persons, the prospect he had at first en tertained of being elected President of the Union, and his subsequent disappointment, have wrought a change in this man which almost exceeds belief. The lawless and rude soldier is metamorphosed into the cheerful, dignified, and hospitable veteran. His soul is elevated by the consciousness that he is the champion of the liberties of his country. There is no doubt, that the unsparing attacks of political opponents, have contributed not a little to his present forbearance and dignified compo sure. That a man of so determined a character as"], [103, "Chap. VII.] OF NORTH AMERICA. 85 Jackson, must necessarily have many enemies is natural ; the assertion that, had it been in his power, he would have caused all the members of the Hartford convention to be hanged, was alone sufficient to justify the animosity of his ene mies. His most ardent friends have many rea sons for wishing to obliterate the recollection of his conduct at New Orleans towards Arbuth not, and on several other occasions : these are stains upon his character, which no subsequent efforts for his country can remove ; and they prevented not only the most distinguished men, but even whole States from joining him in the year 1824. Whether this political delicacy will again prevail, or whether the Federalists and Demo crats will be convinced that Jackson, though violent in his youth and in his maturer years, can not be dangerous to their peace and safety when upwards of seventy, the year 1828 will teach us. The people of the United States can never have anything to fear from men of Jackson's character. This Republic is not French, and an 18th Bru maire, would fail of success. If Jackson should ever lend himself to anv acts of violence, he"], [104, "[Chap. VII. 86 THE UNITED STATES would assuredly be punished for it. The republi can principles which the citizen of the United States has inherited from his father \u2014 his free constitution and his own good sword \u2014 secure him alike from the sudden attempts of ambitious revo lutionists. These barriers cannot, however, secure him from the pernicious fruits of European diplo macy, which, fostered and ripened at St. Peters burgh and Paris, those hot-beds of Machiavelism, infect his principles with their poison, seduce his representatives to crimes approaching to high treason, and, by extinguishing party-spirit, bear down all opposition. If the springs of that diplo macy can be continued in operation, the nation will be forced into a dilemma, out of which it will be unable to extricate itself, and will then consider an hereditary ruler a public benefit. \u2014 It is neither the hero of New Orleans, nor his personal cha racter that ought to influence the republican parties in the election of 1828: political prin ciples alone should be the sine qua non in their future President. If these are such in Jackson as to qualify him for a leader and organ, they ought to choose him, so long as he is faithful to them. That he never will abuse his power"], [105, "87 Chap. VII.] OF NORTH AMERICA. nor plunge the Union into a war with Great Britain, his age is a security ; what the nation on the contrary has to fear from Adams, its present situation with respect to Great Britain teaches.

The ascendency will not be with him, but with the two republican par ties, the Democrats and the Federalists, and the extent of influence he may enjoy, must depend entirely upon them : without the aid of both parties, were he even President, he would be powerless. Adams himself would not be dan gerous without the aid of his Tories. Against this man, Jackson is and must be the counter poise, and we are firmly convinced, that he is at present the only individual in the Union who can apply a remedy to the existing evils.

This Congress is composed of so many States, vary ing in degrees of civilization, that an infinite diversity and contradiction in the views of the honourable members must be the necessary con sequence when assembled in Congress. The cunning literate Yankee, the adventurous New Yorker, the simple and honest Pennsylvanian, the aristocratic Virginian, the proud Carolinian and Georgian, have the same language with the unfeeling and presumptuous Kentuckian, but not the same views. Their manner of speak ing, the course they pursue to attain their ends, are, toto c\u00e6lo, different. The first interest with every member of the Congress is of course his own ; the station of a representative is to be the stepping-stone to a permanent office. His second object is to promote the views of his party ; the next, the interest of his county, then"], [108, "90 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. VIII. of the particular State to which he belongs, and, finally, that of the nation. A central point of union could hardly be expected amidst so many conflicting objects. The interests of the different States clash in such a manner as not to admit of a steady aim, such as is exhibited by the British Parliament. The latter consists of Whigs and Tories, whereas the Congress of the United States, is an assembly of brokers, sent by their respective States not to promote the welfare of the Union, but of their 6wn mean and sordid in terests. One is expected to bring the turnpike through his county, another a canal, a third is to procure a lighthouse, a fourth an academy, or a deaf and dumb asylum. These are the impor tant affairs committed to the representatives : if they succeed, messenger-like, in the execution of their errands, they are called \" excellent fellows.\" The administration of course avails itself of these opportunities, does all in its power to meet the wishes of its \" honourables\" in matters of such vital interest, and is rewarded by corresponding good offices in return. The Congress has precisely the appearance of an exchange, where every one manages his own business to the best of his understanding, without troubling himself much"], [109, "Chap. VIII.] OF NORTH AMERICA. 91 about the affairs of his neighbours, until his own are terminated. \u2014 Men of talents are not wanting in the Senate as well as in the House of Repre sentatives, who might vie with the very first members even of the British Parliament, cer tainly not in point of education and learning, but unquestionably in shrewdness. Webster, Everett, Hamilton, M'Duffie, Liv ingston, Sergeant, Randolph, are deservedly cele brated names ; but as a set-off to such men of genius, there are such men as Vance from Ohio, Mr. Trimble from Kentucky, and most of his western brethren. The well-informed mem bers of Congress are generally from the New England States and the sea-ports ; the most im pudent and presumptuous the Kentuckians: these are now hand in glove with the party of the administration. In opposition to this party are the Virginians and Georgians, both Caro linas, Pennsylvania, part of New York, Ohio, Indiana, &c.

As soon as his name appears in the newspapers, followed by an address to his fellow-citizens, and an explana- tion of his merits and his principles, the notes of the counter-party are at hand, generally worded in well-meant letters to the editor, subscribed by the popular signatures of a Democrat, a friend to his country, or the more classic names of Cimon, Aristides, &c. If a candidate happen to have lived in another State, his well-meaning friends of the opposite party are not slow in drawing from thence all the information which they may think worthy of public notice. If his family connexions be not very extensive, then, after having had his transgressions sounded through- out the Union, he is defeated ; this however does not disturb his peace of mind. The election expenses cannot be compared with those of a member of the British House of Commons; for the sum of five thousand pounds, one might easily purchase the representative seats of a whole State ! Instead of squandering money, of which we are too fond to throw it away for the ambitious purpose of corrupting our honest fel low-citizens, we indulge in a little slander. We have our negotiators as in Great Britain, but"], [111, "93 Chap. VIII.] OF NORTH AMERICA. they are not so much trusted, because we trust nobody. All they have in their power to give, is a pair of shoes, an imitation beaver hat, or the like. The extravagancies in which the English are said to indulge, such as the payment of five guineas for a canary-bird, or ten for a dish of greens to the wife of a freeholder, would be deemed shameful in our honest country ! We are indeed much too steady to imitate so bad an example ! The utmost we give are dinners, with plenty of whisky and brandy for gentlemen and those we think worthy, and a treat, as we usually call it, for the other \" Sovereig?is,\" at some tavern ; this consists of genuine whisky, in the proportion of two barrels for a county, at the rate of three pounds for both barrels. The highest expenses we incur, are with our news papers, and these are said to be enormous ; for two inches square we have to pay a dollar : of course a column often amounts to four or five dollars. True it is, that the honest editors make ample compensation to us for this expense, by laying open and explaining our adversary's faults in such a way, that Hogarth, had he lived amongst us, would not have found it necessary to visit ginshops and the haunts of vice, our"], [112, "THE UNITED STATES [Chap. VIII. 94 newspapers would have furnished sufficient mat ter whereupon to establish his name. Brother Jonathan is known to carry his inquiries very far, and even into the privacy of families ; and if the lady of a would-be honourable, in some States, does not happen to wash her husband's and chil dren's linen, and make their clothes, he is as suredly undone ; he has no claim to popularity ; he is a proud man, a Federalist, a Tory, and heaven knows what besides. This is pretty much our mode from the Alleghany Mountains to St. Louis, north of the Ohio. In cities the case is rather different. In general the Americans of German descent suffer most \u2014 the negotia tors sent to them, have their hands most un fettered. The majority of these honest people, though living and amongst Anglo-Americans, for the second and third generation, can neither read nor write the English language. Passive un der a kind of self-satisfied ignorance which never consents to learn more than their forefathers, and adhering to their axiom never to become Irish (thus they designate the Anglo-Americans who take the revenge by nicknaming them the Dutch), they are contented with their own Ger man idiom. This they know sufficiently to"], [113, "95 Chap. VIII.] OF NORTH AMERICA. enable them to spell one chapter of the Bible on a Sabbath-day : this book and the Baltimore Almanac constitute their library. If any of them take a newspaper, it is a German one. These German productions are the poorest things ima ginable ; the style, the diction, the printing, the paper, are all beneath censure. The negotiators have an easy game to play with these simple people, and accordingly mislead them from their true interest. Respected as they deservedly are for their industry and perseverance (for there is not the least distinction made between Anglo and German Americans), they never seek the com pany of their American fellow-citizens, and can have no opportunity of making acquaintance with those who are best calculated to promote their welfare. The last election for Alleghany, County Penn sylvania sufficiently shewed how far these good people were behind their fellow-citizens in this respect. The united Counties of Alleghany, Buttler, Armstrong, and Beaver, are entitled to send two members to the House of Represen tatives : one of these gentlemen, Mr. S , had resigned. Of the two persons who an nounced themselves as candidates, Colonel O"], [114, "[Chap. VIII. 96 THE UNITED STATES was the most popular, General S \u25a0 the most intelligent. The former, a young man of from thirty-six to thirty-eight years of age, had served as a captain of militia in the last campaign, and by means of aunts and uncles, and no small portion of artifice, he succeeded in rendering himself so popular, that he was chosen member of the Assembly at Harrisburgh, Colonel of the Militia, and Senator of the State of Pennsylvania. In this capacity he was thought so passive, as not to startle at any contradiction, and he was therefore justly beloved by his fellow members, because he never interfered with their interests or their views. His rival, General S , on the contrary, was a man of talents, connected with some of the leading men at Washington and Philadelphia ; he was well acquainted with the interests of Western Pennsylvania, and of fered himself with the full conviction, that, under the present circumstances, he alone should be chosen, if the voters understood what was for their own good : the result ought certainly to have been in his favour. The neighbouring Sister States, animated by the friendliest inten tions, are endeavouring each one according to its means, New York by her Great Canal, Virginia"], [115, "Chap. VIII.] 97 OF NORTH AMERICA. by the Chesapeak and Ohio Canal, and Ohio by the Cleveland Canal, to cut off the trade of Penn- sylvania in an indirect way. The moment is urgent, and nothing but a canal, uniting the Susquehanah with the Ohio, or a rail-road from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, will protect its trade from ruin. These were certainly important reasons why these counties should choose such a member of Congress as would be likely to promote their interests. Unfortunately, General S was proud, in the German sense of the word ; he did not like to dress in worn-out or home-made clothes, or to stop at every tavern and drink bad whisky to the health of every peasant: he accordingly failed in each of the four counties. On an electioneering excursion to the county town of Beaver, he stopped at the house of one of the most influential free- holders. This old farmer was very near being brought to the gallows under old Adams, owing to the sedition laws then in operation, and he had since this time sworn deadly enmity to every Federalist. After having alighted from his gig, the General entered the house, seated himself of course with his hat on, according to the true republican style, without speaking a word or H"], [116, "[Chap. VIII. 98 THE UNITED STATES waiting for permission. This was all very well, and the farmer seemed pleased with his new guest. General S , after a pause, inquired \" How far do you call it to B ?\" \" Twenty miles,\" was the reply. \" That is too far for me to-night, don't you know where I could stop and get a night's lodging ?\" \" Your manner of ask ing,\" replied the gloomy farmer sullenly, \" is rather short and in an imperious tone. I guess you are one of these G \u2014 d d \u2014 d Federalists?' \" Why d \u2014 d ?\" gently replied General S ? \" Then you are certainly one of them !\" vocife rated the old man, opening the door at the same time, and leaving him no other choice than to get back to his gig and return home. In a few hours the story was spread all over the county, the General was laughed at, and Colonel O was elected almost unanimously, without doing anything more than treating the German pea sants with whisky, and speaking to them of their horses, their cattle, or their corn, and dressing in clothes that had been worn by his grandfather. The German population of the two other counties were gained over by a promise to this effect : \" If you help us this time, we shall give you the next chance.\" It availed the General nothing that he"], [117, "Chap. VIII.] 99 OF NORTH AMERICA. obtained the majority in Pittsburgh and Alleghany county. The result was such as may be antici pated ; the counties have no canal \u2014 but the House of Representatives has one drowsy member more. This is very much the way in which the honour ables are elected, particularly in those counties peopled by descendants from Germans, or where these people constitute the majority of voters. They never fail to select among the candidates the man of the meanest understanding, and thus the term of honest German is almost become synonymous with stupid German. This prevalent spirit of democracy no doubt does very well in an enlightened State ; but if a person is to be elected for no better reason than that he is a potter or a carpenter, or for his hav ing the manners of a journeyman, it shows a poverty of understanding which provokes our contempt. These very errors in the mode of electing their representatives, are the causes why the State of Pennsylvania is so much ne glected, and its interests so little attended to. It possesses neither the influence of the New England nor of the Western and Southern States, which, although democratic, are not so far ad vanced in their predilection for these principles, H 2"], [118, "100 THE UNITED STATES [Chap.

No wonder then that some worthies are to be found among the representatives of the middle States, who, to the no small scandal of the more fashion able imitators of the British House of Commons, are economical enough to send home, in a truly republican manner, their dirty linen and worn out pantaloons franked by the mail ; the linen to be returned to Washington by the same con veyance, the clothes to be altered by their ho nourable ladies into second-hand trowsers for the offspring of the parsimonious representative. As soon as one of the members of Congress opens his mouth, you may tell to what part of the Union he belongs.

Men of learning, natives as well as foreign ers, are not wanting amongst them, but they are generally too impatient, too egotistical, to apply the necessary time to study the specula tive sciences. If the American visit a college, he does it not to improve his talents, but to make money as speedily as possible : he wants to learn quickly, and only to acquire what is abso lutely necessary. Satisfied with the elements of science, he supplies the rest by private reading, by experience, and by natural shrewdness. This may explain the reason why there is even in their men of superior genius, so strange a mixture of learning and home-breeding, if I may so express myself, so much light thrown upon still more shadow, so much wit and shrewdness with such little logic and philosophy. The American sel dom gives his attention to any science that is not likely to be conducive to a livelihood : to \"make money\" is the object, to which every other is subservient. Philosophy he leaves to the clergy, poetry to the ladies, and if any unfor tunate should happen to wander into these fanci ful regions, he is very likely to starve, unless he expatriates himself, or is provided with a suffi cient income. The Boston bard was actually"], [122, "104 THE united states [Chap. IX. exposed to this danger, had he not very lately been relieved by subscriptions. These occupa tions are looked upon as idle pursuits. The American takes an interest only in politics, law, mathematics, and, perhaps, in medical science. His progress in the three former is well known, and these sciences have become popular; an Ameri can being generally more or less versed in politics, in the law, and in mathematics. Here his talents are truly astonishing, and men who would be reckoned an ornament to any country, are prin cipally indebted, for what they are, to their own exertions. As long as the United States remain free, and we hope they may long continue so, they will doubtless produce great men in these sciences. In modern times, music, poetry, and philosophy, have been more especially fostered in monarchies, and are not likely to flourish in the United States, amidst the bustle of mercantile and public life, as they were wont to do in the delightful regions of Greece and of Italy.

Among the northern colleges, those of Dart mouth and Bowdoin in the New England States, Carlisle and Meadville in Pennsylvania, and Beardstown in Kentucky, &c, deserve to be mentioned. The elementary books in these colleges, are extracts from English works and literary magazines, in which, for the sake of economy, the most heterogeneous subjects are huddled together : sometimes not less than twenty different studies in literature, belles lettres, phi losophy, astronomy, mathematics, navigation, physic, &c. It would be in vain to seek for profound knowledge in these works. Academies, at which grammatical reading and writing, mathematics, geography, history, and Latin are taught, are now established throughout New England, New Jersey, New York, and Penn sylvania, in the different county-towns of these States ; and these may be considered, with the free-schools, as the chief resorts of the great body of American youths. Universities, colleges, and academies, have their presidents, vice-presi-"], [125, "107 Chap.

The temporal affairs of these insti tutions are carried on and inspected gratuitously by a board of trustees with a president at their head. Their funds are raised either from grants of lands, from donations, or from assignments made by the government, and from private sub scriptions. In the new States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, &c, the central government has taken care to provide for public instruction ; the thirty-sixth part of every township being as signed for public schools, and a whole township of twenty-three thousand acres for the university of each State. These appropriations, being wood lands, yield as yet little or nothing, there being no settlers to improve them. Free-schools are now established in the New England States, New York, New Jersey, and partly in the other States. The children of the poor and the wealthy, here receive alike a gra tuitous education. They are instructed in read ing, writing, arithmetic, geography, and the his tory of the Union.

It is to these schools that the Northern States are so much indebted for their mental improvement, andfor a diffusion of knowledge, superior, perhaps, to that of any other people. In the year 1825, an attempt was made to introduce similar schools into the State of Pennsylvania, to enable her to keep pace with her more advanced Sister States. The executive moved the question, which being seconded by the legislature, the plan was commu- nicated to the counties, but failed in those where the German population constitute the majority. Every endeavour to bring these honest people to reason proved unavailing. \" Why,\" exclaimed they in their own idiom, \" our gentlemen would have us again pay a tax for the purpose of esta- blishing offices, which we would then have the further expense of maintaining, and our own mother tongue would go for nothing ; we won't do that : and we see the effects of learning in the Yankee tricks, the forging of bank-notes, and in the natural consequence, the gallows !\" Who does not observe in the tenor of this language, the filial ties which, notwithstanding a distance of four thousand miles, and their American birth"], [127, "Chap.

The instruction given in Sunday-schools is well meant but inefficient. These institutions are, however, highly creditable to the feelings of the Americans, who display in splendid colours, on this as well as on other occasions, their hu manity and their respect for their poor fellow citizens. The unremitting zeal and patience which the most respectable ladies and gentlemen be stow on the instruction of the poorest children, deserve the highest praise. It may be presumed that in a country where so much attention is paid to the fair sex, and where it must be allowed that, generally speak ing, they are so well entitled to it, proper at tention is paid to their education.

The wealthy families usually send their daughters to boarding-schools at Boston, New York, Philadelphia, or Balti- more. The price of the first class, is from four to six hundred dollars a year, for board and lodging, independently of tuition, which amounts (every item included) to two hundred dollars more. The instruction comprehends, writing, reading, mathematics, drawing, painting, geogra- phy, astronomy, history, the French and Italian languages, singing, the pianoforte, and the harp. The prevailing custom of introducing the pupils once or twice a week into the society of good families, essentially contributes to the improve ment of their manners. Paintings and drawings are executed by these fair scholars which would often do honour to a master ; and there is a map of the State of New York, drawn by Miss R., which is deemed superior to the best extant. The distance from which these young ladies come, is sometimes above two thou sand miles, being sent from Louisiana, and Missi sipi. As there is, however, no light without shade, these schools have their drawbacks. The assem-"], [129, "111 Chap.

From this short sketch it may be seen that there are more ample means provided for po pular than for literary information. The free schools are, throughout, better adapted to their objects than the universities and scientific insti tutions, Westpoint excepted. This ought, how ever, to be the case in a free country. Wherever, the mass of the people constitute the sovereign power, light ought to be diffused through the whole body. The universities can only be at tended by a few wealthy youths, whose fortune sufficiently elevates them above their fellow citizens, and whose learning contributes still more to widen the distance. The free-schools, on the contrary, are intended for all : the ut most attention ought, therefore, to be bestowed upon them.

IX THE UNITED STATES he sets upon this dignity, is proved by the exist ence of innumerable institutions, all springing from the people. Even the Western States are not so much behindhand as is generally supposed. I have visited those countries several times, spoken with thousands of their inhabitants, and have not met with a single Anglo-American wholly destitute of learning. The art of reading and writing is widely diffused, and the assertions of English travellers respecting the stupid igno rance of these backwoodsmen, are mere sallies of wit, and should be so understood. If I found a man entirely unlettered, I could be sure of his being an emigrant Irishman, or a descendant from the French. Libraries are now to be found in almost every county-town. The more respectable inhabitants, such as Lawyers, Physicians, Ministers, and Mer chants, frequently put their libraries together, and deposit them in a room of the court-house for the use of every inhabitant in the county. Those who borrow books from these libraries, pay a small annual or monthly sum for the use of them. The money thus raised is applied to the purchase of new works, or to repay the proprietors for the in juries done to the old ones. These small collec-"], [131, "113 Chap. IX.] OF NORTH AMERICA. tions, seldom exceeding five hundred volumes, contain generally the British Classics, Shakspeare, Milton, Thompson, Pope, Johnson, Hume, Ro bertson, Sterne, Byron, Moore, and Burke, toge ther with Franklin, Jefferson, Marshall's Life of Washington, Botta's History of the Revolution, Washington Irving, Cooper, &c. In large towns the libraries are proportionably more extensive, and those of Philadelphia, New York, Boston, &c, if not very numerous, are certainly select, mostly consisting of English works, except the New Orleans library of eight thousand volumes, which is chiefly composed of French authors. Of the most important bulwark of a nation's liberty, the freedom of the press, no people make a more extensive use than the Ameri cans. Their newspapers are justly considered as the principal sources of public information. The American attends to his newspaper not like the Germans or the French, for the pur pose of deriving a topic of conversation upon politics in which they have no concern, but for the regulation of his public and private life. A rigid inquiry into the measures of government, which would in some countries be deemed arro gance, in others a crime, is with him a point of I"], [132, "114 [Chap. IX. THE UNITED STATES duty. He is a member of the sovereign body which elects its own representatives, who be come responsible to him for their acts ; he, there fore, is obliged to manifest his opinion as to their proceedings. With him the measures of his own immediate State, the acts of Congress, of his Assembly, and his county, and the contests of parties, are points of primary importance: the affairs of foreign countries, Great Britain alone excepted, are to him of less moment. No other nation dares to express its sentiments on politi cal, financial, military, judicial, and mercantile affairs like the Americans, because no other government can take so much interest in en lightening their fellow-citizens upon matters which may more or less concern them. The newspapers, therefore, comprehend the whole life, public and private, of the Union. The complaints of any particular State, against grievances inflicted by the central government, the grievances of the traveller whose landlord or captain has ill-used him, are alike inserted in these journals.

What is your profession ? What is your business ?\" He asks such questions, in short, as you are required to write down for the police at every inn in France, Prussia, and Austria ; an unsatisfactory answer would expose you to criticisms and suspicions. It is almost impossible for a suspected person to escape ; his shrewdness seldom fails to find out his man. Endowed as he is with a capacity for retaining in his memory the dress, the look, the physiognomy, and a thousand other circum stances, it will excite no wonder that out of one hundred persons advertised in the public papers, scarcely ten escape apprehension, owing to the scrutinizing eyes of this popular and gratuitous police. The advertisements before mentioned, and others relative to ships, goods, discoveries, &c, &c, sufficiently account for the astonishing num ber of American newspapers in circulation. Up wards of one thousand are now printed in the Union : Pennsylvania alone has one hundred and fifty. There is hardly a county as far as the falls of Ohio, which has not at least one public paper, 1 2"], [134, "116 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. IX. some of them meagre enough, but they answer the purpose. The poorest man is thus enabled to keep a newspaper, the cost of which does not exceed three dollars (thirteen shillings) a year, as there is no stamp duty attached, which he is permitted to pay in produce. The central go vernment has taken every care to facilitate the circulation of these papers, the postage of each amounting to only one cent in the State, and one and a half if sent out of it. Unrestrained in language and comment as John Bull may be, Jonathan goes beyond him ; and I am sure that if some of the members of the Holy Alliance could read these papers in their original language, they would operate like physic, and re lieve many an oppressed country, by visiting the readers with a bilious fever. The best public papers are reckoned to be The Richmond Enquirer, Neale's Weekly Register, Noah's Advocate, and the newspaper of Mr. Walsh, formerly a Jesuit.

The scientific or critical journals cannot be compared with their patterns the British, though they begin to be rather more than repetitions of the Edinburgh and London Reviews.

These, with a number of academies for arts and sciences, societies for the improvement of agri culture and commerce, with medical, philoso phical, and physical institutions, certainly consti tute a fund of popular information, which though in some instances defective, may fairly be con sidered as superior to that of any country of equal proportion and similar means."], [136, "[Chap.

The American conducts himself towards his wife and his children, with very little more familiarity than towards his neighbours : this formality seems not quite in accordance with republican manners, but, when closely consi dered, will not be deemed out of place. To this reserve it is principally owing, that in American families so few instances are found of that bru tality which too often disgraces the lower classes of other nations.

He is, therefore, on his guard, and rather inclined to hypocrisy, always demeaning himself with more outward correctness amongst his friends and neighbours than amongst stran gers, who are of course indifferent to him. With principles we have nothing to do in this case : where waltzes and cards are in vogue, they are seen waltzing and playing whist ; whereas at home and in county-towns, they would not ven ture to name cards without a shudder. It may be thought that this kind of cunning is pushed too far, but in America we are not liable to be deceived by cunning, which, though current like depreciated paper-money, only imposes upon the ignorant. The wealthier families live in a style which, in New York especially, exceeds all due bounds. The ladies of New York, imitating the fashion of the British metropolis, seem to forget that to assume the character of Peeresses, something more is re quisite than a Cachmere shawl, bonnets trimmed"], [138, "[Chap.

After having gone through the Chronique Scandaleuse of the last twenty-four hours, they make the round of the fashionable shops until three ; at three, dinner is served ; this is followed by a ride, after which they go to the Italian opera or to the theatre, and then to supper. A ball changes the order of things, and supersedes opera or theatre. It is certainly not the fault of the ladies if they do not attract attention ; their attractive powers are great, and they are not wanting in endeavours to set them off, especially if a stranger or a foreigner of supposed rank should make his appearance. Nothing can be more entertaining than to watch them on such occasions ; all the springs of female vanity and espiotnuige are put in motion, and the adventurous spirit of the female fortune-hunter has reached its highest pitch, if"], [139, "121 Chap.

In a few days the diamond will often change into a glass- stone, and the lord, count, or baron, into a runaway adventurer, and our embarrassed Miss resorts again to her virtuous pride, which is ready at hand until another sub ject is found. A number of stories are weekly related on this interesting topic, and though half of them prove mere fabrications, it requires no very acute penetration to discover that the American ladies, in point of prudence, are still superior to their British cousins, whose love is said to be in exact proportion to their marriage settlements. Some years ago a young British merchant came introduced to Mr.P , and was invited to dinner ; he came \u2014 he saw \u2014 he con quered. A few days were sufficient to ripen the affair, and the young man was requested to give a more explicit account of himself; he did so, and being young, handsome, and though not rich, still being possessed of sufficient property to begin business, he was accepted. The wedding-day was fixed, when unhappily arrived Mr. S , a wealthy Virginia bachelor, who was forty years of age, and possessed of thrice as many slaves, with two plantations. This"], [140, "122 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. X. gentleman, or rather his plantations, were too respectable not to claim every attention on the part of Miss P , and of course the company of the planter was preferred to that of John Bull, who for a while was put aside. He withdrew, and immediately returned the gages d' amour which he had received, expecting the lady would do the same. In a fortnight the old bachelor, who, as might be supposed, was too well versed in affairs of this kind to exhaust himself in such tokens, took his departure, and access was again per- mitted to the discarded Englishman. John Bull, however, despised the hint, and even threatened to publish the affair if the presents were not re- turned. They were in consequence sent back, and Miss P , like many of her fair sisters, had the threefold mortification of losing iu a fortnight, two lovers, a diamond-ring, a breast- pin, and ear-rings. Other examples of the kind might be adduced, but, as we are afraid of offend- ing the fair candidates by dwelling too long upon this matter, we forbear. Anyone to whose lot a lady of this description falls, may be sure of not getting the very worst of her sex. One little objection I should myself feel to a union with one of these prudent ladies,"], [141, "123 Chap. X.] OF NORTH AMERICA. is, that they always live much longer than their husbands. What they want in feeling, however, they supply in prudence, and they become cau tious, well versed in human affairs, and extremely circumspect ; moreover, they behave with great decency in company. In elucidation of such characters, who are less rare than might perhaps be imagined, the following, touching one of the most respectable ladies in P a, may be added. Her son, a young lawyer, came to practise at K n ; being rather too much of a gentleman, he was soon disgusted with the dry study of Blackstone, and returned to his bibacious habit of drinking brandy in Mr. M 's tavern : the rest of his time was spent in bed. Notwith standing his trembling hand, this hopeful son met with an object who seemed likely to return his addresses ; his mother was informed of it, and ordered her son home, to the great dis pleasure of the tavern-keeper. \" William, are you married ?\" was his mother's address to him, when he entered her room on his return from his late residence, at a distance of upwards of three hundred miles. \" No, Madam !\" \" Well, go to your room and wait my orders.\" These were, that he should set out the next day to a"], [142, "[Chap. X. 124 THE UNITED STATES distance of three hundred miles, in a direction opposite to K n. Some weeks afterwards, Mr. and Mrs. P arrived at Philadelphia, and paid a visit to this lady. The conversation hav ing turned upon her son, \" Why,\" said the tender mother, \" I am very glad that it has been in my power to prevent this unequal match ; I should then perhaps have had to provide for his children as well as himself. I do not know indeed what to do with this young man ; he drinks so terribly, and smokes so incessantly, that I shall be forced to send him next summer to New Orleans : there the yellow fever I hope will cure him.\" Although the majority of fashionable ladies are by no means of this way of thinking, yet boarding-schools, and boarding-houses, dashing foreigners, and especially the absence of all dis tinctions of ranks in society, give them a certain degree of assurance, which seems to be founded on the idea that they are necessarily the central point of man's attention. If you happen to meet with them in company, on a journey, on board a vessel or a steam-boat, they will not expect the attendance of the gentlemen like their European sisters, and be grateful for such gallantry, but they will claim it as their right, and a lady is"], [143, "125 Chap. X.] OF NORTH AMERICA. even capable of sending word to any gentleman who has not shaved himself clean, that \" he is expected to dress himself properly.\" Want of delicacy, or rather want of feeling, is never more apparent than on the occasion of parting from their children. In several States the father is entitled to the service of his son till he has attained the age of twenty-one. This state of vassalage has ceased in the wealthier families and in cities, but a feeling of indifference still prevails. It is a salutary custom in a country like Ame rica, where ready means of existence and of ac quiring a property are open to all, that children should have nothing to expect from their parents before their decease ; but I should be happy to find a corrective applied to that shocking want of feeling so often exhibited in the separation of parents and their children. One son is going to Buenos Ayres, the other to Carraccas, and a third to New Orleans, and yet the mother is no more affected than if they were starting upon an excursion from New York to Philadelphia. There are many honourable exceptions to this rule, sufficient, I flatter myself, to invalidate it, but this does not render the existing examples less revolting."], [144, "126 [Chap. X, THE UNITED STATES If you wish to see Jonathan with all his pecu liarities and those peculiar shades which constitute the national character, you must visit him in county-towns or in the country. There, his mode of living, though of course less fashionable is more unfettered, and he appears in his original and real character, the free member of an inde pendent and extensive commonwealth. The most distinguished statesmen retire to the country or to county-towns. The would-be fashionables and imitators of bon ton on a petty scale, who are to be met with in every village of Europe, you would seek in vain in America. The poorest renter having the same vote as the wealthiest in habitant of New York, his deportment and con duct are the same. Their morals, if we except a greedy pursuit of money, are pure, and the living in any of the county-towns is extremely cheap. A person possessed of seven or eight hundred dollars a year (from one hundred and sixty to one hundred and eighty pounds sterling), may live on quails, pheasants, turkeys, and keep three horses and two servants, especially if he lives rent free. The same style of living would cost in Philadelphia three thousand, in New York four thousand, and in New Orleans six thousand"], [145, "127 Chap. X.] OF NORTH AMERICA. dollars a year. In Great Britain, the principal attention in furniture is directed to the drawing room ; here it is the parlour \u2014 this is adorned with chimney-pieces, looking-glasses, carpets, a pianoforte, and a sideboard stored with abun dance of decanters, filled with gin, brandy, whisky, and Madeira. For six hundred dollars a country parlour may be furnished tolerably well. Amusements in the country chiefly consist of eating and drinking. The hour of breakfast, we might say dinner, is eight o'clock : this meal consists of coffee or tea, chickens, beefsteaks, mutton, veal, fish, cakes of corn, wheat, or buck wheat cakes, aud jellies. Another dinner is taken at one o'clock, with a glass of brandy, gin, or whisky, the ladies drinking cider, milk, or water. At seven a third dinner, here called supper, is served, and a regular tea-party of course increases the stock of provisions, with all accessible dain ties, such as turkeys, venison, hams, tongues, jellies of every description. \" We help our selves,\" says the American, and \" thank God, just as John Bull is accustomed to do \u2014 but un like him, we attend only to one occupation, that of eating in silence, aware as we are, that the teeth and the tongue cannot obey two masters at"], [146, "128 [Chap. X. THE UNITED STATES the same time.\" The tea-table being removed, the party retire to the fire-side, and, quietly seated round it, discuss the various talents as they occur. If two lovers are present, they are permitted to converse with each other in the same steady manner, and to form those tender connexions which finally end in matrimony. They do not look so closely here as in mari time cities after wealthy matches. A young man of good figure and of some profession or trade, no matter whether he be an American or a Russian, has a fair chance of success with the ladies. Their affections prevail even if the decision of the inquisitorial tribunal should not prove satisfactory, and the hymeneal ties prove generally more happy when contracted with asteady youth, who, though at present not rich, has the means by his talents of becoming so. A very proper feeling exists upon this point. They have quiet tea-parties, balls given either on public occasions, such as the declaration of the Independence, the anniversary of the birth day of Washington, or the like. Supper and refreshments, as rum, whisky, brandy, gin, are amply provided, much too amply indeed for the convenience of the ladies, who have often to"], [147, "129 Chap. X.] OF NORTH AMERICA. dance after midnight witht heir tottering partners. The dances are cotillons, country-dances, and at private balls, waltzes. On these occasions much awkwardness is often displayed, a fault springing from our country ladies and country gentlemen, who, unless they are educated in Philadelphia, or in any other fashionable city, are seen heavily stamping about, not very unlike bears, to the music of an orchestra, consisting of one or at most two violins. These are played by old Ger man revolutionary soldiers, who know but one tune, which they perform with corresponding dex terity, so long as whisky and brandy have not quite overpowered senses and nerves. But as no such abhorrence of discordant sounds exists here, the dance is continued until four o'clock, when the company retire exceedingly delighted with the superb entertainment. Of this an ac count is immediately inserted in the newspaper, to give the county an idea of the finished tone which their fashionables have acquired. Entertainments have here sometimes a poli tical tendency. I remember a ball given in R . The lawyers of this town had a certain pique against their presiding judge, occasioned by an anxious desire of getting into his place. K"], [148, "130 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. X. The wily S was, however, too well aware of their friendly disposition, and too conscious of his foibles, to indulge in deep potations : he re- fused all invitations. At this particular time he unfortunately arrived at R with his daughter, and, unable to resist her solicitations, he went to the ball. She was well received, but no further attention seemed to be paid to him ; not so, how- ever, with respect to his daughter, who, upon her entrance, was immediately surrounded by a crowd of fashionable country beaux. The poor President Judge debated within himself the ques- tion to drink or not to drink, for nearly two hours. Feeling at last secure from the little attention which seemed to be shown to him, he ventured to take one glass of the delicious brandy, then another, and after having taken the third glass, he was unable to resist the tempting seducer. Indian like, he poured in as much as he could. The gentleman of the house, with his lady, met him half way, by substituting mead instead of brandy. At one o'clock his honour was so over- powered with the good things of which he had so copiously partaken, that it was found necessary to carry him home in a country litter. Care was taken to expose him as much as possible to"], [149, "131 Chap. X.] OF NORTH AMERICA. public view, and upwards of fifty persons saw the honourable judge carried home in this degraded state. On the next day the very person who gave the ball, had an address drawn up, signed, printed, and circulated, which petitioned the As sembly for the deposition of his drunken wor ship. The House of Assembly, however, inquired more particularly into the affair, and having seen through the conspiracy, Judge S \u2014 escaped with a severe reprimand, and Mr. B failed in his ingenious attempt to succeed to the office. It is difficult to form an idea of the simple and industrious habits of the American farmers ; the whole family are in motion from morning till evening. Children from six to eight years of age have their allotted tasks. As soon as the school has ended, about the middle of February, the sugar-boiling engages their time, the young ones are seen carrying wood, emptying the small troughs filled with maple-water into the barrels, and the adults are chopping wood, or boiling sugar. The labours of the field succeed ; while the lads are ploughing and sowing, the daughters are breaking flax, or spinning, weaving, or making dresses for themselves and the family. The sons until they have reached their sixteenth year, and K a"], [150, "132 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. X. the daughters until the age of fourteen, are sent to school during the three winter months. After having been confirmed, their parents gene rally permit them to work and so to provide for themselves. Isa lad has thus worked for the space of two, three, or four years, and if his finances have accrued to a sum deemed sufficient for his establishment (though rarely exceeding one hundred dollars), he thinks of marriage. The object of his affections he knows from the meet ings, or the maize huskings. He repairs to her house before supper, which being ended, he ap proaches the beloved object with his hat on. The preliminaries of the treaty are short, and generally in the same terms : \" Do you like my company ?\" If the reply be \"No,\" the matrimonial candidate moves off with a \" very well ;\" if the reply be \" I don't, know,\" then there is hope ; if it be \" perhaps I could,\" this is a half consent ; and \" yes I do,\" is decisive. In the latter case they sit up during the night by the kitchen fire entertaining one another in the best mode they can. The pa rents care little about the proceedings of their children in this point, unless the match should appear too unequal : but even in this case the lad prevails. The clergyman is summoned, or,"], [151, "133 Chap. X.] OF NORTH AMERICA. in default of one, the justice of the peace is ap plied to, and it frequently happens that hymen joins the couple on the following day. If the parents are wealthy and satisfied with the match, a dinner is provided ; if otherwise, then whisky must suffice. The long and tedious courtships of towns and cities are here unknown ; if the youth be of age, and the girl likewise, they marry with out asking leave of any one, and if not, they fre quently do the same. If the justice of the peace or the minister refuse to marry them, they go into another township, and should the esquire be here equally unwilling to expose himself to the penalty of three hundred dollars for the sake of the matrimonial fee of a dollar and a half, then they go into another State, where at last the romantic scene is concluded. These cases, how ever, seldom occur : these youths, though adven turous in the highest degree, being far from romantic, for in tbat case they would forfeit their portion. The portion of the farmer's son consists of a horse, some agricultural implements, and seeds, but, for a very obvious reason, no money. The dowry of the girl, is her bedding, a cow, kitchen utensils, and, if the parents are rich, a bureau,"], [152, "134 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. X, a table, and six chairs : with these moveables and sixty or seventy dollars, to which the wife adds fifteen or twenty out of her savings, the couple begin their husbandry by purchasing one hundred acres of woodland, at one dollar an acre. With the assistance of neighbours they build a cabin, with a stable and a barn, and in the course of two years they are free from debt, as they are both accustomed to work hard and lead a plain life. Their pastimes are welshcorn huskings, and cabin-blockings, and such frolics, besides the singing school. Generally they meet for this purpose during the night preceding the Sabbath from a distance of from three to five miles."], [153, "135 Chap. XI4 OF NORTH AMERICA. Chapter XI. Religion \u2014 Clergy\u2014 Synods \u2014 Sects \u2014 Roman Catholics \u2014 Unitarians. One of the wisest resolutions ever taken by a legislative body, was unquestionably that of al lowing perfect freedom of conscience, and of ample religious toleration, or rather of placing all religions on equal terms. Whether this reso lution be the result of philosophical inquiry, or of the simultaneous principles and opinions of the first leading characters of the Union, is of little consequence. Whatever may have been their views on that measure, the effects are no less beneficial to the State.

XI. in Europe, became the property of the people, and even when apparently deserted, its absolute necessity became the more visible, and its domi nion was the more firmly established. Although the dogmatic system of the different Christian forms of worship may have suffered from this adaptation of them to the popular opinion, and though many an inquiry may have taken place, at which an orthodox believer would have shud dered, the true Christian religion cannot but have gained by the change. The most unbelieving sceptic must surely feel inclined to serious reflec tions, when, in a country so perfectly free to choose whether he will believe in religion or not, he sees that religion, which was less than twenty-five years ago an object of derision and contempt on the continent of Europe, and is only just reviving, displaying in America a multi tude of churches erected to its honour, and fre quented with an eagerness that affords the clear est evidence of the truth of Christianity, and of its natural and necessary operation upon the human mind. The American is religiously in clined, and if not so in reality, in appearance at least, he is more sincere than the European. In Philadelphia there are at present above"], [155, "Chap. XI.] 137 OF NORTH AMERICA. eighty churches and meeting-houses, all of which are much more frequented on the Sabbath than those on the continent of Europe. If we take into consideration that the American has to pro vide for the support of the church and its minis ter, and that these expenses frequently amount to more than the public taxes he has to pay, the religious character of the people will appear in a more striking light. In Philadelphia, New York, Boston, and the larger commercial towns, the style of buildings is splendid, and exhibit a taste and liberality equally conspicuous. These are visible in their elegant carpets, splendid lustres, richly decorated pulpits and communion-tables, together with a gilded organ and tasteful pews. I allow that vanity may have had some share in these embellish ments, but the display of it on these occasions is entitled to indulgence. In the flat country from Philadelphia to Harrisburgh, a distance of one hundred miles in length and breadth, there are many churches iu a style of architec tural beauty, which would not disgrace any Eu ropean city, and these are erected by country congregations at their own expense. It is not unusual to see a farmer in but moderate circum-"], [156, "138 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XI. stances, subscribe from two to three hundred dollars. Pittsburgh, which is not more than fifty years in existence, has now ten churches, amongst which is the Trinity church, completed in 1825, in a style of Gothic elegance, worthy an European metropolis. Several members of its congregation subscribed five hundred dollars; and yet this city though, perhaps, wealthy, is far from being very opulent. Greensburgh, on the Philadelphia road, thirty miles on this side of Pittsburgh, has, for a population not exceed ing eighteen hundred souls, no less than four churches, and the country congregation which is without at least a wooden meeting-house, is either very small, or a very poor one indeed. About Greensburgh there are seven German congregations, who have elegant brick churches, each consisting of from fifty to sixty families. Not long ago one of these was finished at the expense of six thousand dollars. If we consider that amongst the number of the congregation, ten families may be said to possess some wealth, fifteen or twenty with a bare sufficiency to live upon, and the rest absolutely poor, who, under the existing pressure and the low prices of produce, can hardly contribute anything, it will"], [157, "139 Chap. XI.] OF NORTH AMERICA. appear beyond a doubt, that to be religious in the United States is very expensive. To these expenses for the building of churches must be added the minister's salary, from one to a hundred dollars for each family ; unquestionably the heaviest tax an American has to pay, and which he is only brought to submit to, from the circumstance of the tax being self-imposed, and his having the power of selecting his own minister. In most of the States which were formerly subject to British government, Synods were instituted, such as existed in New England; in other States the congregations appointed such ministers as they found in their way. Nu merous dissensions and difficulties arose from these selections; frequently when the preacher, who was sometimes neither more nor less than a Yankee schoolmaster, or pedlar, or a suspicious character, was accepted by the one party, he was infallibly rejected by the other. After every diffi culty was removed, and the preacher was in full exercise of his functions, reports were circulated of his former life and character, through the me dium of the newspapers, which obliged the reve rend gentleman to disappear abruptly from the scene of his ministerial labours. To obviate this"], [158, "140 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XI evil, the ministers of almost all sects, after the ex ample of the Presbyterians, resorted to the insti tution of Synods, which are assemblies of or dained ministers, into which none were received who either could not prove their being ordained, or who did not subject themselves to an exami nation. Though neither these Synods nor the management of ecclesiastical affairs in general, are to be considered as connected with the go vernment, or as supported by its authority, these institutions enjoyed universal approbation, inas much as that, without at all infringing by their ex istence upon the liberty claimed by the congrega tions to choose their own preachers, they pre vented for the future, the appointment of any who had not been examined and approved of. At first these Synods were not numerously attended ; there were at most, ten or twelve ministers with as many deputies. In the course of time new members joined them in whose ad mission every precaution was used. The Synod was nothing more nor less than what it is at present, a private assembly of the clergy, who with the consent and approbation of their con gregations gave to themselves a kind of hierar chical constitution. They were not authorized by"], [159, "141 Chap. XI.] OF NORTH AMERICA. any particular class, and no person was obliged to join them ; but the very order of their pro ceedings, and the great esteem which was paid to the individual minister, as well as to the whole convocation, contributed to increase their num ber, and established a distinction between their body and the various reverend vagrants dispersed throughout the Union. Wherever a numerous congregation was formed, they of course pre ferred preachers approved by the Synods, who could give some security for their good conduct, and subject themselves to proper responsibility. If they were found to lead an irregular life, or to contravene the regulations of the Synod, they were excluded : even then, however, it rested wholly with the congregation to retain or to dis miss them. The decrees as well as the regula tions of the Synods are private acts; and although the congregations should refuse to submit to them, the government never interferes except ing when they have publicly engaged to main tain their ministers, and have signed deeds deposited in the county or state office. Then the congregation as well as the subscribers may be compelled by law to adhere to such articles as they have bound themselves to observe."], [160, "[Chap. XI. 142 THE UNITED STATES However loose may be the ties of this hierar chical Union, the best security for its perma nency, and the confidence reposed in it, may be found in the free will of the congregations, and the publicity of its proceedings. These Synods are now established in the Presbyterian, German, Lutheran, and Reformed churches throughout the United States, and comprehend all the ordained ministers. They meet every year at a place previously determined upon, where they hold their sessions during four or five days. All the affairs of the congregations under the spiritual care of the members are considered and revised : the President and Secretary are chosen by the votes of the ministers and of the deputies from the congregations. It is by means of these Synods, instituted in the simple evan gelical spirit of primitive times, that the hier archical system of the United States has been brought to a condition which does not yield to that of any other country. If there be at present a congregation without a minister, application is made to the Synod, which either sends one, or incorporates the congregation into a neighbour ing flock. If several congregations are without spiritual aid, they are visited by a minister, who"], [161, "143 Chap. XI.] OF NORTH AMERICA. performs divine service, and uses his best exer tions to become popular with the leading mem bers. If the majority of the congregation be in his favour, and the subscription such as to an swer his expectations, the Synod is informed of his election, and its approval invests him in his spiritual office. The present penury and scarcity of money have had great influence over the churches and their pastors, and they must now be satisfied with diminished incomes : in the western countries they are often paid in produce. This is particu larly the case with those resident in the country, of whose salaries of between four and eight hun dred dollars, four-fifths at least are paid in this way. The payment of ministers whose sub scription is raised by the wardens or deacons of the congregation, varies in amount, though never exceeding five thousand dollars. Those of the Episcopalian church are considered as the best paid ; those of the Presbyterian, on the contrary, have the lowest income. They, however, de serve well their salaries, especially in the country, their different congregations being often at a distance of more than twenty miles from each other. Still this is trifling compared with the"], [162, "144 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XI. hardships those of the western parts have to endure. They often have to travel five or six thousand miles in the year in the regular dis- charge of their ministry. The situation of these preachers is certainly not enviable. Every Sun- day they have to preach two, and even three ser- mons, and to perform a journey of twenty and more miles from one meeting-house to the other. Creeks or rivers, snow or rain, heat or cold, must not prevent their avocations, as the mem- bers of the congregation are never deterred by such difficulties, They have to perform their journeys through woods on horseback, for to ride in a carriage is quite impossible, owing to the impracticability of the roads, and their own slender incomes. Of the four churches belonging to the Epis copalian, the Presbyterian, the Lutheran, and the Catholic forms of worship, the former have regularly established theological institutions, though in order to become a teacher of any sect, it is by no means necessary to have studied divinity. The Lawyers Hopkins, Jenkins, &c, have turned preachers without having ac quired any other information than from their own private studies. Such examples are nume-"], [163, "145 Chap. XI.] OF NORTH AMERICA. rous, and the most admired preachers are gene rally those who left other professions for the pulpit. The ministers of the Episcopalian church, from their principles of toleration and freedom of conscience, are more popular among the better classes of society than the gloomy Presbyterians, who present many specimens that would remind us of the Mucklewraths of old, though there may be found amongst them many distinguished and respectable men. Their best theological semi naries are in the New England States, which are the very nursery of preachers, and supply the western and south-western States with \" multi tudes\" of them. The German ministers, amongst whom are many very distinguished men, are instructed by one of their pastors, with whom they reside for one or two years. The preparation being finished, the candidate is introduced to the Synod, ex amined, and then either approved or rejected : if admitted, congregations are assigned to him, to which he repairs, and immediately enters upon his functions. The Lutheran ministers, German as well as English, eminently distinguish them selves above their Reformed and Presbyterian L"], [164, "146 THE UNITED STATES [Chap XI, brethren. The preachers of these three churches, as well as the Catholic priests, are considered in the light of regular ministers, and live in perfect harmony. Disputes are seldom heard of, and they often unite their efforts to procure the erec tion of a church. Families are known to sub scribe in the same manner to the support of three or four different preachers. The Episcopalian clergy are beginning to grow rather more zealous in their calling, owing to the numerous desertions of their flocks, but particu larly of the younger part of their congregations. In the north of the United States the Sunday is well known to be exclusively dedicated to the performance of religious duties. A good Chris tian family is seldom contented with one sermon; generally they hear two or three. To hear none, would, in the Northern States, and especially in New England, New York, and Philadelphia, be deemed unfashionable ; and a repetition of this neglect, would subject the absentee to exclusion from society. If they belong to the Episcopalian congregation, they hear in the forenoon their own minister ; in the afternoon they go to the Presbyterian meeting, and as on the Sabbath every species of entertainments would be thought, even"], [165, "147 Chap. XI ] OF NORTH AMERICA. by the more liberal part of the community, highly indecorous, and even subject to a penalty in some of the States, the female has no other alter native than to go a third time to the Methodist meeting, where they often become converts. \u2014 The Methodist preachers, by the warmth of their enthusiasm, and by the zeal which they display in their calling, are found to attract many pious women, to the no small uneasiness of the established church, thereby necessarily curtailed in its spiritual and temporal interests. As, however, there is no remedy for this loss, and the minister who would presume to raise his voice against the evil, would be sure to loose all popularity, as endeavouring to restrain the liberty of conscience, he is forced into liberal ity by the common example. This liberality ex tends so far, that it would be thought highly improper by the very members of his own con gregation, if their minister should dare to in veigh against other forms of religions. \" In every church we may be pious, and we are all of us Christians,\" are expressions frequently heard on these occasions, and they act accord ingly. The child under the paternal roof, will choose its religion without the smallest inter- L 2"], [166, "148 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XI ference of its parents, unless it should evince a preference for the Catholic faith. There are families in which the father is an Episcopalian, the mother a Presbyterian, one of the children a Baptist, another a Methodist, all living peaceably and quietly together, in the sedate and quiet manner which marks the American character. They never grow warm in debate ; every man maintains his opinion, without regarding that of his neighbour. Some time ago, Miss B from G , was desirous of being confirmed by Bishop W , then on a tour through Pennsylvania. She had no friends among the candidates for confirmation, and requested a friend of hers to keep her company and partake of the rite. Her friend who was a Presbyterian, consented without the least hesita tion, thereby deserting the religion of her parents, who did not seem to notice it. On being asked how she could so readily give way, she replied, \" Why, I could not let her go alone, and to tell the truth, I like Mr. B better than this old snuffy T .\" This is not only the case with Miss B , but with many steadier persons. It de pends entirely on the minister, whether the Epis copalian or Presbyterian, or any other church is"], [167, "149 Chap. XI.] OF NORTH AMERICA. to be the most fashionable in town. If he should succeed in rendering himself popular with the majority of the inhabitants, which attempt, and to deliver a good sermon, are the chief points to be attended to, then he may reckon upon a full meeting-house, and, consequently, upon a large list of subscriptions. If he does not know how to win popularity, or how to preserve it, his spiri tual authority will assuredly cease before the year is at an end, and he will have to place his travel ling staff at a greater distance. The congrega tion of the Episcopalian at P was not very numerous, although, as is generally the case, it consisted of the most respectable and wealthy in habitants of the place. The rector, who had quitted the bar and turned preacher, was at no loss to discover the mode of increasing his con gregation. He persuaded them to sell the old church and to build a new one, of which he drew out the plan. A majestic yet simple building of Gothic form, was erected in a style of magnifi cence far surpassing the other nine churches. No fashionable family of the place could resist the temptation of taking seats in the new church, so splendidly decorated. The pews were rapidly sold, and the subscription list was filled up in a"], [168, "150 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XI. manner that left the reverend gentleman no rea son to regret his change. These pious stratagems are, generally speaking, unattended with bad consequences, as it is deemed in reality a very indifferent question, which of the reverend com petitors has the most auditors, or the most in come, provided his conduct be in accordance with his profession. On the other hand, the bad conduct of ministers has often been attended with pernicious consequences ; and cases could be cited, where a single deviation has induced a congregation to abstain for years from any in tercourse with the teachers of religion . The other sects have no regularly educated ministers, and they are permitted to ascend the pulpit without being previously examined. They speak, to use their own words, \" when they are prompted by the spirit.\" This spirit seems often to deceive these good people, at least they are heard to utter gross absurdities. The religion of the people in general, as well as that of a certain class amongst them, is everywhere in exact proportion to their understandings. The enlightened and better classes in the United States, are to be found mostly among the Epis copalians ; the middling classes, with numerous"], [169, "151 Chap. XI.] OF NORTH AMERICA. exceptions, are Presbyterians ; the zealous and enthusiasts of all classes are Methodists ; while the poor and simple Backwoodsmen are among the Ammonists, Mennonists Christians*, New Men, Tunkers, &c. If the latter are questioned about their religious principles, they look stead- fastly with open eyes, and reply, \" We keep our- selves according to the Bible.\" They celebrate the Lord's Supper at midnight, they wash each other's feet, wear long beards, and are baptized in the rivers, where they wade to the chin either in- winter or in summer. One of them being asked the reason of allowing his beard to grow, went to his chest, took out an immense Bible with woodcuts, and pointed to the beards of our Saviour and the Apostles. There is no disput- ing such authority. The poorer classes join these and similar sects, which in the Western States are very numerous. Their preachers are honest peasants, who explain the Bible as well as they are able, and will discourse four or five hours in a continued strain of simple eloquence, without any apparent fatigue. Happening to pass on a Sabbath-day through Beaver, and being obliged to stay there, I was * A new sect so designated."], [170, "152 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XI amused at hearing one of their sermons, in which the preacher discussed the question of Noah's Ark, how it was pitched within and without ; he calculated the quantity of pitch and tar which the builder must have consumed. This honest man, as he further explained, had examined rather too minutely a keelboat at Pittsburgh, on its way down the Ohio and the Mississippi, and having seen the caulking of these vessels, he edified his auditors with a description of Noah's proceeding in rather a colloquial manner, doubt less to their no small spiritual comfort. \" Jona than has made an extremely fine speech,\" the good people would be heard to say, \" I am of the notion that he beats all those learned longheads, and all is God's word \u2014 all is in the Bible, I have read it myself.\" And with ejaculations corre sponding with their capacities, they left the barn which was their place of meeting ; the more wealthy to seek their horses and ride home two or three astride each animal, the poor returning on foot. These Tunkers have highly attractive powers for the poor, and were it not for their long beards, which as they learned from their grandfathers are only worn by the Jews, their numbers would be still greater. Considered in"], [171, "153 OF NORTH AMERICA. Chap. XI.] the proper light, these sects are far from being contemptible ; they are, on the contrary, in many respects very beneficial, as the connecting ties of poor families, which would otherwise be left to themselves in these Backwoods. They hold strongly together, mutually relieving and sup porting each other, and in time of need or of sickness, their indigent brother , may rely upon their aid. They keep up an exemplary discipline. A member guilty of drunkenness or any other vice, \" is thrown over the fence,\" or, in unfigurative language, he is excommunicated. The families are under mutual inspection, and have a regular divine service. It would, however, be desirable, if they took somewhat more care of the educa tion of their children, who, as the parents think learning a sinful thing, remain grossly ignorant. Another reason for the great numbers of these sectarians, and especially the Methodists, is the quickly ripened hierarchy of the established forms, with all the appendages of pious ambition, egotism, hypocrisy, and supercilious humility, as circumstances call them into operation. The American of the Western States, who is anything but over-religious, holds such conduct in abhor rence, and prefers, therefore, the Methodists or"], [172, "154 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XI. Baptists, whose enthusiastic zeal appears to him more appropriate, and less expensive. The Epis- copalian on the contrary, and especially the Presbyterian ministers, dwell more upon moral and political topics, enlarging upon the merits of their favourites, and forgetting the Bible and its contents. They seem particularly fond of Mr. Adams ; and the influence which he exercises over a vast proportion of his countrymen, through these devoted spiritual emissaries, can hardly be exceeded by the French Jesuits. This is certainly the case with the Yankee ministers who are spread over a vast portion of the Union. The ministers from other parts of the United States conduct themselves in a be- coming manner. But to return to the Me- thodists. These, and especially the Methodists of the Episcopalian church, have indeed done much to propagate the Christian religion; and whatever may be said of them, the western parts, where they sent missionaries, and distributed thousands of Bibles, are standing records of their usefulness. The western settlers, especially on the extremities of the different States, had lost almost every trace of Christianity ; the majority were not even christened. Being in a state of"], [173, "155 Chap. XI.] OF NORTH AMERICA. continual warfare with beasts and Indians, they became so barbarous, that they scarcely exhibited the remains of civilization ; and were it not for their dress, and the lighter hue of their skin, many of them could hardly be recognised from native Indians. In order to appreciate the labours of the mis sionaries, it is but fair to speak of the hardships and privations to which they were exposed. To ride several hundred and even thousand miles, through uninhabited and pathless wilds, in quest of petty settlements of from five to ten cabins, to deliver a sermon to very unwilling ears, and to encounter a rough and unfriendly reception, was too often the lot of these devoted men. I am acquainted with a young man, now the pos sessor of a beautiful farm on the banks of the Miami, in the State of Ohio, who was appointed Missionary to the territory of Arkansas ; he went three hundred miles beyond the town of Little Rock, to find out a settlement of Kentuckians, which was represented to him as established there. After incredible hardships he arrived, and found eight cabins inhabited by seven white, and twice as many negro families. In five houses, each distant from the other about half a mile,"], [174, "156 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XI. lodgings for the night were absolutely refused: he was about to seek refuge in the woods, when the intercession of an old negro-woman procured him a shelter, and some ears of corn for his supper. Divine service was announced for the next even- ing, none appeared but the negress, her master, and a negro. Regardless of this want of atten tion he preached a sermon ; \u2014 the next evening his auditors increased to ten, the following to twenty, and the fourth night all the settlers came with their children and their negroes, the latter to be baptized. He continued his instruc tions during several days, and promised to pro vide them with Bibles, which were sent accord ingly to Little Rock, from whence they were to be fetched. The good seed, however, had fallen on stony places. Though they afterwards came to Little Rock, they did not think proper to trouble themselves with the tokens of remem brance which had been sent to them. On the other hand it cannot be denied, that the religious exercise of the Methodists, their camp meetings in particular, are of a nature offensive to religion and to morality. I had heard of so many circumstances respecting these meetings, that I resolved some years ago to convince myself of their"], [175, "157 Chap. XI.] OF NORTH AMERICA. truth or falsehood. Accordingly I made an excur sion to Meadville, forty miles from my residence, where a camp-meeting was about to be held. The next day I rode, accompanied by several acquaint ances, to the place of the meeting. We arrived at a wood with an open free ground, on the left of which was a farm-house. About four thousand people with twenty preachers were present ; part of them were at work erecting huts, with trees and branches. At ten o'clock the religious exercises began, which only differed from other forms of worship, by the ranting of the preacher, and the deep groanings of his audience. We returned to Meadville, to revisit the place in the afternoon. The scene was now changed ; one of their most violent enthusiasts was in the pulpit, and his theme was the love of Christ, and the hatred of sin : the stream of his eloquence overflowed with love. At the words \" You are to love Christ fervently, you are to hold him in your arms,\" the whole assembly sighed deeply, and such ejaculations were now heard, as almost to bereave me of every sense. The preacher growing warmer and more violent, exclaimed at last, \" There I see Christ \u2014 there he is sitting'\u2014 nodding to me. \u2014 \" There is Christ,\" exclaimed one of the auditors."], [176, "158 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XI. \" I have him in my arms,\" cried another. A third and a fourth joined in the exclamation, and such a scene of sighing, jumping, leaping, and beating their breasts ensued, as became only a company of madmen ; this, however, was only the prelude to what was to follow. The preacher after a short pause began to speak of sin ; how Christ and sin were incompatible, how sin was the work of the devil, and brought us or would bring us to hell. The sighing now changed into groanings, reminding the hearer of a field of battle. The more the preacher enlarged upon the torments of hell, the deeper was the groan ing. On a sudden one of the women was seized with violent convulsions, her face became livid, her eyes were distorted, a cold perspiration ran down her forehead ; she was raised, as if by a supernatural power, and fell senseless to the ground. A howling ensued which was heard at the distance of two miles : many of the women threw themselves down beating their breasts, and tearing their garments ; others jumped like Bac chantes, their hair flying in disorder, their breasts thrown open, until exhausted with shrieks they sank down by the side of their sisters. Life seemed to have fled with decency from these"], [177, "159 Chap. XI.] OF NORTH AMERICA. fanatics: half naked they lay senseless on the ground, until removed by the preachers and elders. I observed with shuddering and dismay, to what an extraordinary degree of madness re ligious fanaticism may lead. The evening ser vice was held immediately after supper (a meal which every one had brought with him), and lasted till half-past ten ; it differed but little from the former scene : at eleven the pious fanatics retired to their huts. When the reader is informed that these four thousand sectarians were, almost without exception, of the lower orders, unedu cated and uninformed, and mostly young people of both sexes, who having waited for this oppor tunity with the utmost impatience, arrived from a distance of from ten to twenty miles, he will not be surprised to hear it stated, that scenes of illicit intercourse followed, over which, though delicacy draws the veil, truth commands us to pronounce to be the natural effects of the previous unholy excitement. The next day the same scenes were acted ; on the third day both preachers and auditors were so exhausted that they returned home. Though the existence of these Methodists in the United States, is but the growth of the last"], [178, "[Chap. XI. 160 THE UNITED STATES thirty-six years, they are already separated into several sects, who have either the Episcopalian or Presbyterian form of church government, and their hatred of each other is inveterate. This enthusiasm, however, appears to be rather on the decline ; and it is to be expected, that in a coun try where enthusiasm is permitted to have such free course, and to ferment unimpeded, it will, like its predecessors, soon evaporate. It cannot be denied, that whatever good there may be in these sects, they have also their dark side. They are invariably marked by a certain narrow mindedness, which can only rejoice in the welfare of their sectarian brethren, and is indif ferent to the rest of their fellow-creatures. And whatever may be said in favour of the Quakers, their peaceable demeanour, their industry and fru gality, their principle of mutual assistance, still the true patriot has many objections against a society which disclaims one of the most import ant public duties, the defence of their country, and whose cares are confined within the limits of a sect, to the no small disadvantage of the general weal. They would not even contribute, by a pecuniary assistance, towards the defence of the State of which they are members;"], [179, "Chap. XI.] 161 OF NORTH AMERICA. and the forbearance and delicacy exhibited at their refusal, by the State of Pennsylvania in the last war, is a brilliant proof of the liberal principles displayed by the American govern ment. The regard which the American bears to free- dom of religion and of thought, is founded on the nature of his situation. Thousands of his fellow-citizens live in the Backwoods, and are de- prived of every opportunity of visiting churches. The Bible is their teacher; by constant perusal they become well versed in its contents. It re- quires no great sagacity to discover much dis- cordance between the doctrines it contains, and the various creeds which man has established ; common sense and solitude teach them to rely less on fallible authority, and to distinguish be- tween divine and human precepts. Conscious of their liberty they pursue their own way : they find supporters as well as opponents among their neighbours ; ambition is awakened, each party defends its opinions with corresponding warmth, the question excites interest, and a sect is esta- blished. The government could not prevent this without appointing a minister, a course not easily to be effected in these Backwoods, independently .Ai"], [180, "162 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XI. of its being at variance with the fundamental principles of the Constitution: for although the Americans submit to receive ministers sent to them by their bishops and Synods, they would not acknowledge them if the government were to interfere. This is the cause which alienates the American from the Catholic church, whose priests he knows are in the interest of the Court of Rome. Not that there are any restraints laid upon Catholics, they are, in the exercise of the forms of their re ligious worship, as free as any other church ; they would, however, attempt in vain to render their creed popular, being considered as not having at tained to freedom of opinion, but to be still in mental fetters. The simplest sectarian is re garded, in respect to his religion, with a more kindly feeling than the Catholic : this may be at tributed to the different point of view in which this church stands to the nation. The Protes tant minister acknowledges the sovereignty of the people, the Catholic that of the Pope ; the Protestant feels every interest in enlightening his congregation, the Catholic priests keep them in darkness ; the latter, who are commonly Irish and French, are monarchical in principles, the"], [181, "Chap. XI.] OF NORTH AMERICA. 163 Protestant are Republicans : in several States, therefore, the road to public offices, though not altogether closed against Catholics, is certainly made very difficult to them. They seem particu- larly obnoxious to the Presbyterians, and a Ca- tholic and a Heathen are with them almost syno- nymous terms. The number of Roman Catholics is, however, great, amounting to upwards of a million. Of late years the Roman Court seems to have paid great attention to its transatlantic flock. Numerous priests were sent over from Ireland, Italy, and France, and there is not a moderate- sized town in which one or more do not officiate. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, New Orleans, &c, have their bishops, among whom several are men of profound learning. The number, how- ever, of this church falls off considerably ; and if not increased by emigrations from Ireland, there would, with the exception of Louisiana, soon be little necessity for a bishop. The seeds of the \" true church,\" will hardly grow in this here tical soil ; and powerful as are the exertions of the Jesuits everywhere else, in the United States this community is but little noticed, and it would have died away, if it had not been recruited from France and Italy. The Court of Rome, we hope, M 2"], [182, "164 |Ch.ip. XI. THE UNITED STATES will be satisfied with exercising its spiritual do minion over the southern part of the transatlantic hemisphere. A particular mention ought to be made of a sect which is daily becoming more numerous in the Union, and is greatly adding to its numbers from the higher orders of society, I mean the Deists, or, as they call themselves, Unitarians *, who at present have their meeting-houses in almost every considerable town. There may be persons who find in their peculiar views and in the power of their minds, a compensation for the comforts which they reject by refusing their belief in revelation. We are far from interfering with them, only adding, that all their philosophical researches taken together, have not yet made a single iota of the New Testament superfluous. Whole congregations of male and female philo sophers diffused throughout a continent, ex hibit, however, too absurd a picture, to leave any doubt of their ultimate and even early extinction. That this may be the case, is devoutly to be wished by every friend of society, and by every reflecting man. There can be no doubt, that the * Unitarianism in the United States, especially the Western, is pure Deism, and not as in England a partial belief iu revelation."], [183, "Chap.

Where the barriers erected for the security of the individual are so few, and so easily to be overcome, \u2014 where none of those general ties called national habits, love of country, or vene ration for the Constitution are to be found, \u2014 where the citizen parts with his house and removes to a foreign country, just as he would part with a bank note, \u2014 where he is perpetually amending and altering his Constitution *, there ought to be at least one tie to bind him, which is placed beyond * The mania for improving (as they have it) the Constitutions of the single States, and even that of the Union itself, is carried to such an extent, that during the last years (1825-1826) the question was seriously agitated in Kentucky and some of the South-western States, whether it would not be better for their greater independence to have no Constitution. Even the steady Pennsylvania begins to be infected with this mania for change, thinking it derogatory to its dignity, to be fettered by a Constitu tion framed by others, even were it the great legacy of Franklin himself. \" We have the same right,\" exclaim these Backwood politicians, \" nay, considering our advanced intellect and civiliza tion, a greater right to frame laws for ourselves, than our ances tors in their ignorance of existing circumstances had to impose laws upon us.\" Whether to apply our pity or our contempt to such absurdities, is hardly worth the inquiry. We are certainly not unfavourable to political reforms rendered necessary by the progress of events, or by the spirit of the times ; but we may be allowed to ask, What rank would Great Britain now hold among nations, had her Constitution been changed every year?"], [184, "166 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XI. the reach of all contingencies, and which will not be affected by the workings of his fancy or by an overruling power, a tie to which, under every cir cumstance, he will shew proper respect and defer ence. Religion alone can be that tie, and no other than the Christian religion. The Union is well secured against the danger of religion becoming a political engine, as is the case in Europe. Uni tarians may do in rotten monarchies where the Sovereign is the deity, and his will the law ; but in a young and a free country, deistical congre gations are a phenomenon from which our hearts and minds must recoil. Neither Rome, Greece, nor Switzerland, knew anything of them in the days of their splendour, and the wisest of all Greeks forfeited his life by poison, for having dared to confess these doctrines : Great Britain holds them in abhorrence. What guarantee can a Christian nation have that Unitarians chosen for magistrates will pay respect to its rights and its laws, which are both founded on Christian principles? Assuredly none! Whoever disre gards the most respectable constitution of an tiquity (if I may be allowed so to speak of Revelation), will not pay any respect to one of a more modern date ; whosoever fancies him-"], [185, "Chap. XL] 167 OF NORTH AMERICA. self raised above the common standard of in tellect in these most important concerns, will not on any occasion defer to the opinions of others ! I am well aware that some of the very first men of the Union, were Deists or Unita rians, and yet they were men whose intellectual powers ar.d moral principles were firm enough to direct them in their course of life. But they are exceptions, and do not invalidate the truth of what has been urged: and if the great Franklin was a Deist, the still greater Washington was a Christian. That this philosophizing habit of mind, if it should extend further, must necessa rily corrode the Constitution of the State, and be the source of the greatest evils, we are taught to apprehend from the example of a Western State, where the doctrine of Deism, as being the most convenient, is generally found to prevail. For this reason the majority of its citizens are devoid of honesty*, the State is without credit, its laws * In the summer of 1825, four Kentuckians crossed the Ohio on their way from Cincinnati to their own State, with a negro whom they claimed as a runaway slave, and who was secured to the tail of one of their horses.

The second assistant-judge walked behind them, supported by two gentlemen of the bar, as he was unable to bear up under the effect of the copious libations of spirits in which he had just indulged. It was on a Tuesday, and the court, which was opened on the preceding afternoon, was now about to commence business. When they arrived at the court-house, the judges took their seats in the tribune, below them was the prothonotary as clerk of the court, on his right on a bench sat the county officers, the coroner, the sheriff, the commissioners, and the jury. The lawyers arriv- ing by degrees, to the number of twenty-five, from the several inns where they had been engaged in the important affair of making themselves popu lar, were placed in chairs round the rostrum. The customary preliminaries of administering the oaths to the jury being gone through, the trial began. In the year 1823, a couple of oxen belonging to a man named Shara, were publicly sold iu Indiana county for a debt due to a neigh bouring farmer. Shara, enraged at the loss of his cattle, declared he would revenge himself,"], [189, "Chap. XII.] 171 OF NORTH AMERICA. and ran with full speed to the house of his pro secutor. On arriving there, he knocked the old man down, dragged him out, and despatched him with a club. The son of the victim, who, upon the entrance of Shara, had fled for assistance, met him on his return home. \" Well, well,\" says Shara, \" you may go home, your father has done for this life, he will not sell any more oxen.\" The murder was of so shocking a nature, that no one doubted of his being executed. A thousand dollars, however, which were collected by the Irish Catholic countrymen of the prisoner, engaged the powerful lungs of Mr. F in his service, and accordingly the prisoner was only found guilty of manslaughter, and thus escaped with three years imprisonment, perhaps with only one year, as it is an object of economy to save board and lodging in the Penitentiaries. The next court, twenty-five miles distance, was held in Armstrong county in the succeeding week. One of the trials was as follows : \u2014 Two men came down the Alleghany River in a raft. Part of the raft having got loose, was carried for several miles down the river. A young farmer coining out of his house, and seeing it floating, got into his skiff, and when in the act of secur-"], [190, "172 [Chap. XII THE UNITED STATES ing the timber, was met by the two fellows. One of them, without saying a word, levelled a blow at his head, and the unfortunate man dropped from his skiff into the water. His wife seeing the atrocious act, hastened to the county-town eighteen miles distant. The two men were arrested ; they were tried, acquitted, and libe rated. The previous permission of giving bail enabled them to dispose of their raft, and to raise one hundred dollars ; for this sum Lawyer B undertook their defence, which ended in the re sult we have stated. The next court held on the following week at Buttler county, twenty-five miles distant from the county-town of Armstrong, exhibited a scene of another description. A young man owed to a Mr. M ten dollars ; having absconded without payment, the constable was desired to arrest him. This officer being prevented from doing so in person, requested a young man to act for him. The latter accordingly went in pursuit of the debtor, met him at a place two miles distant, and desired he would go along with him, but as he was not provided with a warrant, the debtor was in the act of going away : the young man, on seeing this, levelled"], [191, "173 Chap. Xll] OF NORTH AMERICA. his gun, and shot him through the body. The murderer was committed to gaol, and at the present court was discharged by the aid of five hundred dollars paid to three lawyers for under taking his defence. In this manner were three murderers acquitted in the space of three weeks. I am far from maintaining that the people of the United States are a lawless or a blood-thirsty race of savages. They yield in point of morality to no other people in the world ; but should they in future have less moral feeling, it will be justly attributable to the lawyers. Provided you can hire them, there is scarcely any crime of which they would not undertake to save you from the penalty. Exempla sunt odiosa. He who would have a true idea of the nature and extent of civil lawsuits, has only to refer to land titles for information. We shall confine ourselves to a few specimens. Pennsylvania was the property of the heirs of William Penn ; the government, after having rescinded the grant by wliich it was held, indemnified them by tracts of land and a sum of money. To have the country surveyed, and to divide it into sections, as is the present practice in the New States, was not then thought of, and indeed could not have been"], [192, "174 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XII effected at a time when settlers and money were equally scarce. The Dutch and other foreign companies took immense sections of land for their pecuniary advances ; private citizens were also purchasers, but the greatest part remained in the possession of the State. The question is not how the government should have acted, but that they acted injudiciously, is beyond all doubt. In order to accelerate the settlements, a law was enacted, securing to each bond fide settler four hundred and twenty acres of land. To have built a cabin on this estate, and to have slept in it three successive nights, were sufficient acts of possession to obtain the fee-simple from the land- office. This would have been well enough ; there were however speculators, generally law- yers, who knew what lands were vacant, and endeavoured to establish settlers upon them; they then took out the necessary deeds from the office, and thus got possession of vast tracts, appertaining by right to the poor ignorant occu- piers. Thousands of acres passed in this manner into the hands of these legal swindlers. Others got tracts of from fifteen to twenty thousand acres of regularly surveyed land, on the promise of forming settlements upon it, but the whole of"], [193, "175 Chap. XII.] OF NORTH AMERICA. which grants were subject to forfeiture, in case of the non-performance of the contract within a stipulated time. During the period allowed them, they sold off many thousands of acres, but being unable to settle the whole, the land re verted to the State, and hundreds of poor families who had purchased from these intermediate pro prietors, lost all their purchase money. \u25a0 Others were even less scrupulous, and sold tracts of land to which they had not the least claim, the proprietors of which were residing in distant countries, and the deluded purchasers were compelled to buy the estates again. There are many farmers who purchased their lands two and three times. Some of these gentlemen of the law went even a step further. In G h there is a Judge Pre sident of the Quarter Sessions, a Mr. Y g, a Scotchman by birth, who had come to the United States in rags and wretchedness ; his desolate situation procured him friends, and amongst others, a lawyer who instructed him in the mysteries of his profession. After he had been examined, and had received hrS license, he moved to G h, where he applied himself to the study of the German language, in order to"], [194, "176 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XII make himself understood by the objects of his speculation. To acquire popularity, he went to the houses of his acquaintance with the farmer's daughters when they brought provisions, and by his agency, assisted them in selling their pigs, chickens, and other marketable commodities. The consequences exceeded his most sanguine hopes, and he became very popular with the un suspecting descendants of the Germans. But the shrewd Scotchman wanted something more sub stantial than popularity. In A and W counties \" there were several highly improved farms, originally vacant lands. These were un questionably the property of the farmers who had acquired them by the legal service, and who had only to procure their deeds from the land-office at Reading (now Harrisburgh), or to wait a few years longer until they had completed a settle ment of twenty-one years. The poor people were ignorant of this last right. The Scotch man persuaded them that the land was his, as he had taken the titles from the land-office, but he would not disturb them if they would acknow ledge themselves his tenants. The Germans fell into the snare, and thus from having been real proprietors of the soil, they became mere renters"], [195, "Chap. XII.] OF NORTH AMERICA. 177 of plantations, which, after immense labours and hardships, they had succeeded in clearing and improving. Houses, barns, everything is now the property of this \"Honourable\" impostor. Of the many poor dupes he thus entrapped, one alone applied for assistance, but of course in vain. This was the manner in which the Ho nourable President Judge Y g came into the possession of more than eighteen thousand acres of land, with at least thirty farms, two-thirds of which are stolen property. These spoliations were at one time so frequent, that they consti tuted the principal source of wealth of the north ern lawyers. The lawsuits to which they con tinue to give rise, are also an inexhaustible mine of treasure to them. The commission sales are another. The pro prietors of lands have to pay their county-taxes, whether the property be forest or improved. If the payment of this tax should fall into arrear for two years, the lands are sold by commission ers. As many of these proprietors live either in other States or in foreign countries, and are of ten without agents, these sales frequently occur. Speculators buy and resell them as their undis puted property. The real proprietors, notwith- N"], [196, "178 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XII. standing the public sale of their lands, are en titled at any time within twenty-one years to re claim possession, and to redeem their estates, by defraying all the expenses incurred in the sale and purchase. Numerous suits are the necessary results of such laws, and the expenses are often two and three times greater than the actual value of the soil. I am particularly alluding to Penn sylvania and the Northern States. In some of the western, on the other side of the river Ohio, these proceedings are worse, especially in Ken tucky, and thousands of families are there robbed of their property under the sanction of the ex isting laws. The foreign emigrant is recom mended to be on his guard in those States where the lands are not sold by the central government, or by the land-office, and wherever the smallest doubt exists as to the soundness of the title, the safest way is always to apply to the land-office. From Mr. Noah *, the right worshipful self created taxer of his Hebrew brethren, down to * That the uninformed reader may not suppose that I allude to the antediluvian Patriarch of this name, I beg to state for his information, that Mr. Noah is an American Jew who has recently published a manifesto constituting himself \" Judge of Israel,\" and in this ancient character, is about to levy taxes on his Hebrew subjects throughout the world."], [197, "Chap. XII.] OF NORTH AMERICA. 179 the rude country lawyer who became initiated in the mysteries of Themis and of Blackstone in the Backwoods, all enjoy themselves at the expense of others, uncontrolled and absolute in their dominion. This was not the case fifteen years ago ; it was then next to impossible for a gentleman of the bar (in the country at least) to get elected member of Congress. There is no doubt that a revolution in America will never be effected by the bayonet, but by the artifices of the bar : this new political catastrophe is in slow but steady progress. As may be supposed, nineteen out of twenty of their lawyers are under the influence of Adams, and in possession of every office of distinction. Their profession is the high road to the Presidency, the Bureaux of the Secretaries of the Departments of the sena torial seats, and of the bench of representatives. They are in exclusive possession of the depart ments of justice in all their branches, and in the absence of an aristocracy they now consti tute the gentry of the country, and inspire that sort of respect which is due to men who have life and property under their almost unbounded control.

It must have been a curious spectacle for the people of Kingston and of Jamaica in general, some years ago, immediately before the opening of their ports, to have seen American vessels waiting at the entrance of the harbour, just as the mob is seen crowding the entrance of a thea tre to secure the best shilling place, and when the port was opened, to have beheld these vessels rushing in, laden with every article of Yankee husbandry, in the true old republican way, garlics and onions hanging from the sides, and having on deck potatoes, cider, apples, peaches, and well-beloved whisky, just in the order in which you find them in the green market. There is not indeed a place too distant, too deso late, or too dangerous, to deter Jonathan, if by the voyage he can make a little money.

XIII.] OF NORTH AMERICA. 181 harbours, and a corresponding mercantile govern ment, whose every measure is directed to encou rage adventurous habits, the balance is still against them ; they are falling off every year, the population becomes poorer, and the commerce is rather an evil than a blessing. They have not yet arrived at the point which has been attained, we need not say by Great Britain, but even by the less sagacious Dutchman, that of enjoying a trade and a credit beneficial to the community, as it is to the individuals, and which possesses the confidence of their fellow-citizens, and of foreigners. One might at first be inclined to ascribe this want of confidence to the swarms of foreigners who have settled in the United States, and who, in their progress from extreme poverty to wealth, might be supposed to have been guilty of such practices as would destroy or endanger the commercial credit. No such thing : they are generally very circumspect, and are among the steadiest people (in the American sense of the word), in so far that they would rather sell their country than hazard the object for which they came to the Union \u2014 Money. The cause of the discredit into which Ame-"], [200, "182 [Chap. XIII. THE UNITED STATES rica has fallen, may be found in our Yankees themselves, and in that Hebrew spirit which is unfortunately fostered and encouraged by the government. It is a curious fact, which fully justifies the little confidence placed in the Ame rican mercantile character, that they are actually apprehensive of passing a bill which might have the effect of curtailing the facility afforded to bankruptcies, leaving these regulations to our well-known honesty. Though a motion was made during the last session of Congress, for in troducing such a law, and has been repeated this session, yet it was not proceeded in, but was again laid on the table, and we must of course indulge a hope that it will lay there for several years, either until their credit is entirely gone, or they begin to love themselves less. There are gentlemen, especially in the highly fashionable city of New York, who do not hesi tate to begin a business with a capital of ten thousand dollars, which would require at least ten times the sum ; but as something more is requisite for a merchant than mere Yankee tricks, the re sult is a failure. This, however, does not put his enterprising spirit out of countenance, and he next tries his fortune in Charlestown, establishes"], [201, "Chap. XIII.] OF NORTH AMERICA. 183 himself with the assistance of friends who are his securities, and with the wreck of his property, and again fails in the following year. On he goes to New Orleans, and meeting there with a similar fate, he moves back to Mobile. Some time ago a Mr. H having failed in New- Orleans, he was asked why he did not go to the North : \" Where should I go\" he replied inge nuously, \" I have failed in Boston and in Charles town, I might still go to Savannah, but I will try my luck in Mobile.\" A number of the first-rate houses in New York, Philadelphia, and New Orleans, have failed several times. This is consi dered as a mere trifle, they take another partner and begin again. However hazardous may be the speculation, the wholesale merchants are not deterred from em barking in it. An adherence to one line of busi ness, as was formerly the case with the English or with the Dutch, and even with the Germans, is quite out of the question with this commercial people : they would \" make haste to be rich.\" In Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, the merchants are acquiring a better character for steadiness. New York, however, still takes the lead among the adventurous. They will yet have"], [202, "184 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XIII. to endure many a shock before they are brought to comprehend that bank-notes are not eagles *, and that a fictitious capital is not real. To a merchant possessed of a moderate capi tal, the United States no doubt present a flatter ing prospect. Perfect security for property, a firmly established government, unlimited com merce with almost every nation in the world, moderate taxes, the certainty of a fair profit in steady commercial speculations, are considera tions and inducements sufficiently attractive for the honest and enterprising young merchant, and such prospects are not held out by any other country. The foreigners I am acquainted with here, with very few exceptions, have succeeded beyond their most sanguine hopes. New Orleans in particular may be recommended to wholesale and commission merchants on their first esta blishment in business. Of the state of commerce in this city we intend to speak more at length. What the wholesale merchant is in the maritime cities, the storekeeper is in the country, a re spected and influential member of the common wealth. The storekeeper generally begins with very scanty means, not exceeding one thousand * A gold coin of ten dollars."], [203, "Chap. XIII.] 185 OF NORTH AMERICA. dollars : as soon as he is provided with a license, he repairs to Philadelphia, Baltimore, or New York, where auctions afford him an opportunity of obtaining whatever is adapted to his wants. His goods are loaded and sent home, a store has been previously taken, the goods are put in order, and he commences his establishment as a second-rate merchant, or, as he is designated, a storekeeper. His store should contain gro ceries, such as brown and loaf sugar, tea, spices ; pottery and glass, as plates, pots, tumblers, glasses, bottles ; cutlery, knives, forks, scissors, &c. ; locks and ironmongery of every description \u2014 hats, bonnets, boots, shoes, tin-wares, drugs, paintings, dyeing stuffs ; all the appendages of a country toilette, shawls, ribands, linen, muslins, imitation Leghorn hats, brushes, all in peaceable company with hams, butter, cheese, whisky, brandy, gin, home-distilled wines, and a thousand other things, qu\u0153 nunc prescribere longum est. The country people have of course to pay twice the price demanded for the same article in Phila delphia. The storekeeper, however, cannot ex pect to be paid for his goods in cash, and is obliged to barter, if he wishes to have business. Flour, rye, wheat, whisky, maple-sugar, venison,"], [204, "186 [Chap. XIII. THE UNITED STATES hams, pork, beef, eggs, butter, cheese, &c, are the articles he takes in return. His object is to sell these on the most advantageous terms, either in the town or in a sea-port. When his goods are sold, he again repairs to New York, Phila delphia, or any other convenient city, to renew his purchases. It is quite common with this class of people to amass, in the space of four or five years, a fortune of from ten to fifteen thousand dollars, without having any other no tion of business than that of buying cheaply and selling to a profit : they never hazard any thing, provided they give no credit. Their ex penses are trifling ; the license is fifteen dollars, the charges of conveyance from Baltimore to Wheeling, a distance of upwards of three hun dred miles, amounts to three dollars for every hundred weight, tolls included. If, however, brother Jonathan is not possessed of adequate means, he begins business as a pedlar, with a bundle under his arm of the value of from one to four pounds : these industrious people are seen moving about with neckerchiefs, penknives, and such articles for sale. Their mode of prais ing their ware is so unique, that it is really to be lamented that this eloquence should be thrown"], [205, "187 Chap. XIII.] OF NORTH AMERICA. away on such trifling objects. Brother Jona than exhibits on these occasions, a patience truly singular ; he will listen for half an hour to the oratory of his vagrant fellow-sovereign, will ex amine the goods, put them carefully back again in their former places, and turn his back without uttering a syllable. Our pedlar, however, is by no means discouraged ; with the same ready elo quence he makes a second attack. One of these peripatetic Yankee merchants once offered to sell me a nutmeg ; I was about to pay him, when it occurred to me to try it with my penknife. It was made of walnut-wood in so good an imitation, as to baffle detection unless tried with a knife. \" Stop, Sir, there is another one,\" interrupted the Yankee, afraid of a further trial. I took it in order not to discompose the fellow, who in such cases was provided with one genuine amongst several imitations. When the itinerant dealer has sold his goods, he procures a new stock, and in this way he goes on until industry transforms the pedlar with a bundle at his back, into the owner of a cart writh a pony. He continues in this way, till he is able to settle himself in a county-town as a store keeper, or to take up another mode of living."], [206, "188 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XIII.

His industrious ha bits have become natural, and though in the pos session of two or four hundred acres of land, and perhaps more, he undergoes the same fatigues and toils as at his first outset. Many of these people came twenty or twenty-five years ago to America, and were sold as redemptionists ; in a few years they earned their freedom, and their first business was to marry, and in the company of their buxom wives to travel to the western part of Pennsylvania. There, perhaps, they found an unsettled tract of land, became naturalized, and after a few years they took out the fee-simple from the land-office, and thus grew into inde pendent freeholders.

His descent from four or five ancestors who before him were possessed of this plantation, and having a certain number of tenants to whom he leases small parcels of poor lands which he cannot turn to any account, and who always appear before him with hat in hand, are circum stances which have contributed to give him an idea of self-importance, have tended to disturb his notions of republican freedom, and to establish in his mind the firm conviction, that his own will is to be the supreme law to all who are so happy as to come into contact with so consequential a personage. There is nothing repugnant to his feelings in the thought of transforming his plantation into a lordship. He declares, without disguise, that Virginia and its appendages, the other twTenty three States, will never be happy unless the con stitution of Great Britain be introduced, at least so far as relates to Lords and Commons.

However great has been the progress of agri- culture in New England, New York, Pennsyl- vania, in many points, Ohio and Illinois have got the start of them. Nowhere will the energy and enterprising spirit of the American farmer be seen to such advantage as in the latter States. Nature has destined Pennsylvania rather for a manufacturing country, owing to its inexhausti- ble mines of coal, iron-ore, and perhaps precious metals. New York and the New England States are invited to commercial pursuits by the vicinity of the Atlantic shores, whereas the inhabitants of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, must of necessity be farmers. And if we are to judge from what has been done in the thirty-six years of the set tlement of these States, farming will obtain in it the highest degree of perfection. It is truly astonishing what the labour of a few years, and, comparatively speaking, of a few hands, has performed in these countries. He who traverses the colossal maple, and beech forests of Ohio, will often unexpectedly enter a lane which runs deep into the woods and indi-"], [211, "Chap. XIV.] 193 OF NORTH AMERICA. cates a farm. The fences are quite new ; the fields bear a striking resemblance to a decaying forest, the immense trees had been killed in the preceding spring by means of a wide ring cut into the bark to prevent tbe rising of the sap. Between these withered trees Welshcorn is planted, which, notwithstanding the branches that are strewed upon the ground, and the luxu riant growth of underwood and weeds of every de scription, springs up with astonishing rapidity. A second lane brings you to the humble mansion of the farmer; and judging from the grayish aspect of the fences, and of the barkless trees, whose feebler branches having disappeared, stretch their giant arms into the air in proud memorial of their former grandeur, you will conclude this land has been under improvement for two years. The finest wheat grows between the trees, and rises to the height of a man. As you advance, the ridge declines into bottom lands, and the mea dows appear. Here the trees are partly killed, partly verdant, to protect the grass from the rays of the sun. On the other side are the orchard newly laid out, parcels of land for hemp and flax, and close to the house the kitchen-garden. The dwelling house is built with logs, having the o"], [212, "[Chap. XIV 194 THE UNITED STATES intervals filled up with loam and gravel inter mixed with lime, and generally contains no more than one room. The chimney on the outside is either built of stone or of wood, in which latter case the interstices are also filled up so as to resist the fire. The inside of the house, or rather of the room, shows the cleanliness and economy of the in cipient settler, who has for the present renounced all idea of comfort. On the walls of this room, which also serves for a kitchen, close to the chimney the culinary utensils are suspended ; these are followed by horse-whips, one or two rifles, and the wardrobe of the farmer and his wife. The walls are covered with old news papers in lieu of tapestry, and they may help to pass away your time for an hour or two. The huge connubial bed is placed in the background, and below that, one of smaller dimensions for the younger members of the family. Round the house runs a fence, outside of which, at some distance, is the double log-barn for threshing, with a large aperture, instead of a door, for taking in the grain. Under this barn are the stables for cattle and horses, and on each side are smaller receptacles for corn, with two or three pigsties ;"], [213, "Chap.

The possessor of this farm is a German or an Anglo-American, Yankee, New Yorkian, or Pennsylvanian. After the decease of his father he inherited a fifth part of the farm lands, his brothers having each an equal share, the daugh- ters receiving theirs in money. He improved his inheritance by erecting, with the assistance of his neighbours and relations, the necessary farm buildings, and by turning his inheritance to the best possible account. By-and-by, how- ever, his family increased, as he, like his Yankee brethren, had lost no time in marrying. He re- solves, therefore, upon settling in the west. A purchaser for his property being found, and the necessary money provided, he mounts a good horse, and starts for the Western States. The journey there and back may be between fifteen hundred and two thousand miles, but this is no obstacle to him. If relations have settled before him in the west, he takes care to call upon them, in order to obtain information about the quality of land. If he has no connexions there, he is O 2"], [214, "196 [Chap. XIV.

He may rely on meeting everywhere the warm est encouragement to settle. Distrustful, how ever, of the sincerity of his informants, who generally praise their lands in the most extra vagant manner in order to attract settlers, he examines everything himself, preferring to sleep for some nights under the canopy of heaven, rather than trust their interested praise. If an Anglo-American, he will be determined in the selection of the spot he is in search of, not only by its fertility, but by the vicinity of a river, or at least of a creek, which affords him the prospect of erecting future mills or manufac tories ; coal mines are equally objects of his search. If he be of German descent, he will probably seek only for good land, without con sidering that, though he may be likely to raise more produce, he will sell to less profit than his more prudent neighbour. Having at last found the desired tract, and which has not yet been bought by a land specu-"], [215, "197 Chap. XIV.] OF NORTH AMERICA. lator or by another settler (a circumstance he ascertains from the next farmer), he repairs to the land-office, and pays two hundred and sixty six dollars, one-third of the price for a section of six hundred and forty acres \u2014 if he purchases two sections, then double that sum. Having settled this business, he returns, and having sold his farm of fifty acres at the rate of thirty dollars per acre, the common price for middle land in the Eastern States, he has a capital of fifteen hundred dollars. His grain, his cattle, his fur niture, are disposed of at an auction held in his house, and produce him a thousand dollars more. Out of the sale of his property, thus amounting to two thousand five hundred dollars, he may expect at least one half in ready money. His most necessary domestic or kitchen utensils, his furniture, bedding, together with flax, hemp, and wool, for the employment of the women during the winter evenings, and some dozens of hams, with cheeses, the necessary supply of tea, coffee, and sugar, half a barrel of whisky, dried apples and peaches, are all loaded on two waggons, having each two or more horses. With this equipage he starts for his new settlement. The passengers consist of himself, his wife, probably"], [216, "198 [Chap. XIV. THE UNITED STATES two or three grown daughters, as many sturdy lads, and two or three children, generally form ing together a family of from nine to ten mem bers. The expenses of the journey are comparatively trifling. The provisions, such as meat, bread, Indian corn for the horses, are sold to them in taverns, always at the market price. They pre pare their own meals, and use their own bedding on the journey. These emigrations are so nu merous, that the tavern-keepers seldom dare to take advantage of the travellers, impatient as the landladies may sometimes be at the girls running about their premises. When they start, the sons carry their rifles, and kill such game as they may find by the way ; the daughters are knitting on the waggons, or walking by the side of them, dressed in a clean, and often in an elegant, attire. After a journey of from three to four weeks, they arrive at the land of promise. They usually set out in the beginning of autumn, the finest season in North America. On their arrival, accommodations for the first week are found at the next farm. The farmers with their sons, for the distance of from four to five miles, are invited to the frolic (as it is"], [217, "Chap. XIV.] OF NORTH AMERICA. 199 termed) of cutting down timber, an invitation they never decline. From forty to fifty axes resound in the woods ; the timber is prepared in a few days, and the log-cabin is erected at the place determined upon, which is always, if pos sible, near a spring. The neighbouring farmers and their sons who assist, are treated with plenty of whisky and provisions. The roofing and the building of the chimney are left to the new settler. Boards for the floor and the ceiling are procured from the next saw-mill, and in a few weeks the house is ready to receive its new inmates. The windows and doors are finished after they have taken possession of the house. In the mean time, the bed-linen and the under garments of the female part of the family serve for windows, until the carpenters (who are now to be found everywhere) have finished their work. The next principal care of the settler, is to clear as many acres as are thought necessary to satisfy the demands of the ensuing year. Having at least one thousand two hundred and fifty dollars out of the sale of his property, of which he applies five hundred and thirty-three dollars in payment of the first-third of his two sections, he has now six hundred dollars after deducting his travelling expenses : with this sum he will"], [218, "200 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XIV. be able to perform much in the way of improve ment. For the clearing of one acre, which is effected, as we have stated, by ringing the trees to destroy vegetation, he pays from three to four dollars \u2014 for a hundred fencing rails, twenty-five cents \u2014 and to a journeyman for a day's work a similar sum. With one hundred dollars he may clear before the next spring about twenty or thirty acres, and surround them with fences. This is sufficient for the first year. Generally he divides the cleared lands into three parts ; the first is allotted to Indian corn, the principal object with an American farmer, the second to summer wheat, the third is appro priated partly to meadows, and the rest is planted with potatoes, hemp, and flax. The laying out of an orchard is reserved for the following year. He procures cattle without delay, and is enabled to keep them at little expense during the winter ; in the spring, summer, and fall, they find suffi cient food in the woods. The neighbours, four weeks after his arrival, are again invited to assist him in the erection of a barn, and from fifty to sixty youths join in this \"frolic,\" in return for which act of complaisance he is likewise to ap pear with his sons if called upon. The expenses of his household arc not very"], [219, "Chap. XIV.] OF NORTH AMERICA. 201 great, though he has to buy almost everything, a circumstance which is always a great drawback to a farmer. With a hundred bushels of corn, he will be able to keep four horses till the next harvest, and with one hundred dollars more he provides for the necessities of his household. Want of occupation is what neither he nor his family can have to complain of. During the winter the upper room is put in order, if a snow falls they go out hunting, and seldom return without having killed a deer, or at least some wild turkeys. The females remain spinning, weaving, and knitting for the family, who, for the subsequent two years, wear only home-made clothes \u2014 the winter passes on with these and similar occupations. Their peace is seldom inter rupted, unless the cows, which they have bought from a neighbouring farmer, have strayed, or re turned to their former home. This is generally an occasion of trouble twice in every week. As spring approaches, they proceed to clear the lands. When this is done they commence sowing corn, wheat, and grass seeds. The inter mediate time between sowing and harvest, is employed in eradicating underwood, which is done by ploughing with a single horse between"], [220, "202 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XIV the rows of maize. The harvest yields the farmer at least sixty times his seed, and he has raised upwards of four hundred bushels of wheat, six hundred bushels of Indian corn, and sufficient hay for his horses. The first and most difficult year is over. Before the next autumn he can with ease clear, at least, from fifty to sixty acres, which are again divided and improved in the manner we have stated. He now thinks of laying out his or chard, for which he reserves from three to four acres. His capital is already doubled, and his lands, two sections of which cost him one thou sand six hundred dollars, he would not part with for less than three thousand. In this way he improves his estate, and increases his wealth the more rapidly, as his enterprising industry is nei ther checked by the prejudice of established usage, repressed by timidity, nor over-ruled by arbitrary power. If we proceed three or four miles further on, the next farm will exhibit, in the clearest light, a proof of what the estate we have just described will be in the course of six or seven years. The underwood and huge barkless trees are gone from the fields adjoining the house, though in the"], [221, "Chap. XIV.] 203 OF NORTH AMERICA. more distant part of the farm they are still seen. Two hundred acres of the best lands are cleared and covered with beautiful wheat, corn, grass, tobacco, and other products of a more southern climate. For oats and rye the soil is too strong, they grow too rapidly, and even the potatoes are not mealy. The original rude fences have been replaced by a more elegant and solid enclosure of the fields next to the farm-house and the orchard. The house is surrounded with a light railing, which encloses aneat kitchen and peach-garden, through which a wide avenue from thirty to forty feet long leads to the double steps which terminate in a staircase : the entrance is frequently sup ported by pillars. The American farmer is never deterred by that modesty in his building plans, which distinguishes those of other countries. He will build his house in the same style as the Pre sident, who is like himself a farmer. There are farm-houses erected in the Gothic, Italian, or Greek styles, just as the taste or fancy of their possessors may dictate. The inside of the house shows wealth and comfort, without any strict adherence to the rules of fashion. The parlour is carpeted: in-"], [222, "204 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XIV, stead of the rude chimney, where wood formerly was consumed, you observe the elegant iron coal grate, the sine qua non of an American fire side. A sofa, a dozen of imitation Windsor chairs, a sideboard covered with four or five bottles containing rum, whisky, brandy, gin, ingredients for the much-beloved doddy, and a looking-glass above the mantel-piece, constitute the furniture of the parlour : the rest of the house is fitted up in an equal style of comfort. The same man who eight years ago was hardly worth three thousand dollars, has now a property of twenty thousand, for which he is indebted to an enterprising industry, and to a magnanimous renunciation of most of the comforts of life for six months. This is the mode pursued by thou sands, and aided by a sound understanding and an active and persevering spirit, it will always lead to the same results \u2014 wealth and independence. The Englishman reproaches the American far mer for his wandering, or rather his adventu rous, disposition. That the Yankee merchant, the lawyer, the physician, the speculating board ing-schoolmistress, with her niece or daughter on her hands, should emigrate to the land of promise, the cities of New Orleans and Natchez, in spite"], [223, "Chap. XIV.] 205 OF NORTH AMERICA. of the yellow fever, which not unfrequently car ries off some thousands of these vagrants, does not excite his wonder; but when he sees the steady and respectable farmer, quitting, without hesitation, his native place, his relations, all the dearest social ties, and removing to a dis tance \u2014 not of fifty or a hundred, but of six or eight hundred miles \u2014 this he conceives argues an adventurous, restless, and erratic disposition, which only looks to self-advantage. The cor rectness of this opinion, I think, will have been disproved, by the specimen the reader has just had of difficulties overcome, and comfort esta blished. Did the American yield to excessive sensibility, either in personal or local attach ments, the beautiful plains of the west would remain unoccupied and deserted. That John Bull does not quite relish brother Jonathan's establishment in the western and south-western parts of the Union, especially toward the Pacific Ocean, is well known, though his declamatory vituperations may be less owing to his moral sensibilities, than to a certain patriotic aversion not yet entirely subdued. This, however, is un generous ; for in spite of all trifling discussions and bickerings, John Bull is now a greater fa-"], [224, "206 THE UNITED STATES [lhap.

To return to our farmer. His taxes are trifling ; the two most important are the county and the road-tax. The first is destined to defray the judicial and other expenses of the county, and its amount is from a half, to one and two cents per acre, most of which tax is paid in county bills which the farmer receives as a recompense for his attendance as juryman and for other ser- vices. The road-tax is only paid in case he should refuse to work in person, or by means of his servants on the public roads. The only serious difficulty to which the American farmer has been exposed during the last six years, and which rendered his situation less favourable, is the want of a market for his produce. As long as wars continued, America, from its neutrality, became to a certain extent the granary of Europe. As the exportations of flour amounted in the year 1817, to nearly twenty millions of dollars, the farmer found a ready demand, and by means of the vast water communications, his produce"], [225, "207 Chip. XIV J OF NORTH AMERICA. could be easily transported to a maritime town. These times are past, and the change has been for the worse, the export of flour declining from twenty to four millions. The sea-ports are ac cordingly over-stocked with pork, beef, and flour, to an immense amount. In New Orleans the farmer of Ohio and Kentucky, Indiana or Illi nois, may have a better chance of a market, but even in the spring of the year 1826, flour was to be had in abundance at two and a half and three dollars a barrel. However great may be the in crease of population in cities, it is not in propor tion to the supply. Notwithstanding these disadvantages, how ever, the farmers have still considerable re sources, of which they make but an indifferent use. The breeding of cattle and sheep will always secure a considerable return. These latter, even in the Northern States, have been too much neglected, though an improvement is commenc ing in their sheep, by crossing them with the Saxon breed, purchased at a very high price, from two to four hundred dollars a head.

What principally distinguishes the American farmer from the farmers of other countries, is the circumstance that his agricultural pursuits never make him lose sight of the citizen and republican. Three objects engage his particular attention : his country and its offices \u2014 the State which he inhabits with its representatives, sena tors, and governor \u2014 and, finally, the Congress of the Union. The other States are only of interest to him, as he may be connected with them in any occurrence, or as they come in collision with his own. The affairs of foreign countries, with the exception of England, are indifferent to him. He claims not only the right to elect his own officers and magistrates, but to prescribe to them (in meetings convened for the occasion) the mea sures they are expected to adopt, watching their proceedings with the distrustful eye of a true republican. His deficiency of knowledge in poli tical affairs, he supplies by a due portion of sus picion: this is especially directed against lawyers; and whatever character and forms they may"], [227, "Chap. XIV.] 209 OF NORTH AMERICA. assume for a time, his common sense never fails to detect and to see things in their true light. He obliges the member of the Assembly and Congress to lay before him, in particular cases, the questions to be decided upon. From the constable up to the President, he is accustomed to consider his magistrate as the public servant, who is bound to act according to the public will. If a functionary fail in his duty, meetings are convened, proceedings are organized, and reso lutions passed either in approval or disapproba tion of his conduct. All this is done in a style of perspicuity, the very reverse of diplomatical. These resolutions pass from country papers to numberless others. His independence is greatly nourished by his solitary mode of living in the woods, (his residence being at a distance of from one to two miles from his nearest neighbour,) a course of life which originated in necessity and at last became familiar to him. A more populous neighbourhood would be painful to his love of independence, and he would rather re nounce all intercourse with his neighbours, than alter his unsocial habits. Villages are inhabited by journeymen, trades-people, tavern-keepers, blacksmiths, &c, who hold small parcels of land, P"], [228, "210 THE UNITED STATES [Chap.XlV, but from whom the farmer, properly so called, lives at some distance. After the lawyers, the farmers and planters are the most numerous in the Congress of the United States. It is much to be wished, however, that their knowledge would keep pace with their independence and industrious habits, as the distance between them and their co-senators the lawyers, is much too dispropor tioned. They maintain the same spirit of independ ence in respect to all other professions, and firmly adhere to their own mode of life, drinking, if necessary, tea raised on their own lands, and speedily adjusting disputes with their neighbours, thus baffling storekeepers and lawyers. Even the ties which unite him to his preacher are not very binding, to whose support, if he be not pleased, he refuses to subscribe ; he will read his Bible at home, or choose another meeting-house. In short, he may be considered as an independent man ; than whom, no one enjoys more liberty in its widest sense, or is more conscious of his self importance."], [229, "Chap. XV] 211 OF NORTH AMERICA. Chapter XV. The Militia. Little as the American cares about titles and distinctions unless they are connected with the main-spring of all his actions, money-making, he is not indifferent to the title of captain, major, or colonel of the militia, and he seldom refuses these honours when offered to him, although his years might excuse him from military service. Every citizen, from the age of twenty-one to forty-five, is obliged to serve in the militia: none are ex empt but magistrates, the clergy, physicians, and teachers. The opulent join volunteer compa nies, the less wealthy attach themselves to rifle corps, while the poor, and those less fond of military parade, are enrolled in the militia of their country. The volunteers in their appearance differ very little from the regulars, and are con sidered to have a very martial air. They wear blue uniforms, a ci-devant hat transformed into a czacko with a cockade, and home-made sashes; these, and epaulettes made of a piece of sheep- P 2"], [230, "212 [Chap. XV. THE UNITED STATES skin, pantaloons, and Monroe boots, a musket, and a sabre, complete the equipment of a volun- teer. The officers are rather better dressed, with sashes and silver epaulettes; the serjeant has the latter of an immense size, of tinsel. The rifleman wears a cotton dress, with white or red lace, a fur cap, pantaloons and shoes, a hunting- pouch instead of the cartridge-box, an immense powder-horn, and a poignard by his side. The officers wear the same dress, but of finer mate- rials. The militia-men appear in their common dress, with their rifles, and frequently with a stick. The standard is procured at the expense of the county, the ladies supplying the ribands. When the officers are chosen, a time and place are appointed, the latter generally a tavern, at which the militia are to meet. The subalterns and captains are chosen by their companies, the majors by the battalion, the colonels by the regiments, and the brigadier-generals by the brigade. The election of the staff officers is confirmed by the governor, as Commander-in-chief of the State militia. At the election of officers, the vote of the common soldier is equivalent to that of the major, who at the next election may happen to be in the ranks as a private."], [231, "Chap. XV.] 213 OF NORTH AMERICA. The officer elected never fails to show his gra- titude for the honour done to him, by treating the voters with a quantity of whisky or brandy, suf- ficient to make many of them miss both horse and road, and take up a night's lodging in a turn- pike ditch. Every captain has the right to call out his men for field exercise. It would not, however, be advisable in him to make too fre- quent a use of his privilege, unless he wishes to be turned again into a militia-man in the following year. Two fifes and as many drums constitute the whole of the military band. Bri- gade reviews are held twice a year, and every militia-man has to appear on these occasions, unless he chooses to pay a fine. The Washing- ton guards, the county volunteers and guards, riflemen, and the rest of the militia, all appear together at these reviews. The staff-officers ar- rive on horseback, and are dressed in blue, with immense scarfs not unlike the grand cordon of a military order, large epaulettes, and a sword left behind by some English dragoon, and either round or three-cornered hats, according to the taste of the wearers. The brigade being assembled, they put them selves in motion, first parading through the town,"], [232, "214 [Chap. XV. THE UNITED STATES and if there is but one street, they march three or four times up and down, and then on an open space, where they exhibit their progress in mili tary evolutions. If one or two companies hap pen to keep in something like military order, the rest do all they can to bring the whole again into confusion, in spite of every remonstrance from the officers. Brother Jonathan is too fond of his liberty not to avail himself even of this op portunity to manifest it. The defects of military science are supplied by dexterity in shooting at a mark, and among two thousand riflemen in the interior of the country, there are hardly five hundred who are not capable of shooting a squirrel at the distance of eighty yards. Some years ago a Frenchman from N , accompanied by his lady, came to see me. He had served as an officer under Buonaparte. We went in a carriage to the review of N county. The Frenchman thought the evolutions abomina ble, and indeed the men were all stumbling and marching in the utmost disorder and confusion, talking, smoking cigars, and even taking drams from the bottles they carried about them, without the least attention from the officers to such unmili tary practices ; which were truly disgusting to the"], [233, "Chap. XV.] 215 OF NORTH AMERICA. eye of our Frenchman. An hour's rest to the troops gave him an opportunity of opening his mind to the brigadier. \" Well, well,\" replied the American, \" still we could beat you Frenchmen, and I will show you how.\" The riflemen came for ward and began shooting at a mark. After twenty five had discharged their rifles, the Frenchman, who at first indignantly shook his head, expressed his opinion that in such a Backwood country as Pennsylvania, riflemen, though they were no soldiers, could be of some use. Captain B , a young lawyer, desirous of showing to his lady the extent of the authority with which he was invested, commanded his troops to march at a time when the guards were regaling themselves with twelve bottles of porter ; he ordered them immediately to be taken away. \" D \u2014 n,\" exclaimed his men, \" he shan't take our porter from us again.\" Accordingly Cap tain B turned out next year as a com mon militia-man, and so general was his unpopu larity in consequence of the act, that he also failed in his electioneering campaign for the Assembly of the State. It is much to be wished, however, that the higher ranks in the militia were- filled by"], [234, "216 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XV. men, who, besides other qualifications, had at least some notion of the military science. At present the Union can place very little reliance on the one million eight hundred thousand militia-men, as is sufficiently proved by the war of 1812, and the numerous reverses during its continuance. As Jacksons and cotton bales are not to be found everywhere, it would be but just, as well as politic, to place the flower of the American population on such a footing, as to inspire other nations with some respect, and prevent the militia from being any longer a laughing-stock to foreigners who visit the coun- try. If the mob of Philadelphia have shown of what they are capable, by choosing the hostler Pluck for a colonel of a regiment, and by com pelling Governor Shulze to approve their choice, we do not quarrel with them for the absurdity ; but if the better classes of society can find the broom and corn sticks of the militia-men, and the periwigs and mock dresses of their colonel, so very entertaining, we must be permitted to judge of their understanding accordingly. That the militia system must be reformed, is beyond all doubt ; but if it is proper to effect this refor mation by turning military rank, already sus-"], [235, "217 Chap.

XVI. Chapter XVI. Physicians. I am aware that the Americans will take offence at many things which I have mentioned in the progress of these pages, but the fault is not mine. They would fain persuade the world that their physicians are of the very first order, and that their medical institutions are even superior to those of Europe. We know this proneness to ex aggeration, and it is but fair to correct it. Their best medical institutions, the Harward, New York, and Philadelphia Universities, the Bowdoin and Dartmouth Colleges, are in no respect to be compared with those of London, Edinburgh, Vienna, Paris, and Berlin. Several branches, such as anatomy, materia medica, theoretic and practical medicine, chemistry, are well taught, and in these the American physicians have made some progress ; but this is all that can be said. Botany, physiology, and the higher branches of medical science are considered to be superfluous ; and although these medical or rather surgical"], [237, "219 Chap. XVI. 1 OF NORTH AMERICA. institutions are regularly resorted to, the number of students bears no comparison to the increasing population ; at the most they but supply the wants of the larger cities. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, &c, have experienced physicians. Several of them have studied in London or Paris, the greater number in the American Universities ; and though these latter might be rather called surgeons than physicians, yet many of them have acquired by private study that information which the universities are not able to afford them. But the number of physi cians is wholly inadequate to the demands of the country, and even in the cities, only the wealth iest people can apply to physicians, who are paid for their visits at an enormous price. Persons of less fortune must therefore resort to family medicines or to druggists. In the country, however, there is an evil beyond all bounds, every quack being freely allowed to practice. The generality of \" doctors,\" as they call themselves, are Irishmen or Germans, who have served in some foreign troops, and who begin their career either with false testimonials, or with none. They usually announce them selves as coming from London, Edinburgh, or"], [238, "220 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XVI Paris, to offer the benefit of their experience to the inhabitants of the county. If the medical vagrant happens to be questioned about his cre- dentials, he regrets having lost them during a stormy passage at sea, but he will write imme- diately for duplicates to the medical faculty in Paris or Edinburgh, the members of which are all on most intimate terms with him, and will not fail to give ample testimonials of his great abilities. Whatever may be the complaints of his patients, he never fails to administer his sovereign remedy \u2014 mercury. The mischief which these quacks are doing in the country is incredible. An amiable young couple in A g county, lost, by the ignorance of a would-be doctor of this kind, two of their children in four weeks; the third and last was at the point of death, when the parents sent for a physician to Pittsburgh, who restored the child to health in less than twenty-four hours. I shall abstain from mentioning any other victims of these empirics ; suffice it to say that the evil exceeds all bounds, and that there is assuredly no civilized nation where the life and health of its citizens are less secure than in the United States of North America. In the Western States, Ohio, Kentucky, &c."], [239, "Chap. XVL] 221 OF NORTH AMERICA. the physicians, or rather surgeons, have formed societies after the manner of the clergy, into which none are received until duly examined and approved of. Although the knowledge of these soi disant doctors is confined to a little surgery and the administering of drugs, this measure has already been attended with salutary effects to the States. In the legislature of Pennsylvania, a motion which had been made on the subject, of not being allowed to practise without proper tes timonials, was thrown out. The foregoing is a short but a true sketch of a profession so respectable in itself, and so im portant to the welfare of the human race. To the scarcity of well-educated medical men, may be at tributed that mortality which is far greater in the Union than in any portion of the European con tinent, Holland excepted. Much of it may be owing to the variations of climate, manner of living, &c. The want of proper physicians how ever, may be another cause ; but the principal reason may be found in the ignorance of these quacks, who, administering nothing but calomel, destroy a great part of the younger population when yet in its infancy. Very few Americans are found to retain their teeth to the age of"], [240, "222 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XVI thirty.

His life has been exposed to so many hardships, dangers, and hair-breadth escapes, that he looks with a certain degree of resignation, or rather apathy, on its termination ; and even when it has not been so adventurous, his cold and indifferent nature never forsakes him in his last moments."], [241, "Chap. XVII. ] 223 OF NORTH AMERICA. Chapter XVII. Manufacturers \u2014 Tradesmen. Nothing can exceed the admiration with which everything from England is regarded by the Americans. From a pin, to the splendid dress, all is universally sought for ; and an American lady would think herself exceedingly unfashionable, if she could not sport even a second-hand reticule from England, and display it to public gaze. However Jonathan may pride himself upon his own unlimited freedom, and despise the rest of mankind whom he deems slaves, to England he pays the utmost deference, though much against his inclination, and English manners and (in fashionable houses) English furniture and dress prevail to the absolute exclusion of those of every other nation. In this he differs widely from the English ladies, who think themselves quite out of fashion, unless France has contri buted to their embellishment. That the supe riority of England is shewn by this predilection"], [242, "224 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XVII. for her manufactures, there can be no doubt ; and while this predilection exists (and it will exist so long as American merchants persist in being the mere brokers of England), her manufactures will always, have a decided advantage over do mestic ones. But there is another observation to be made, however unpalatable. Though they may hap pen to get a tailor for their next P 1, there is in the southern and south-western States, a secret pride which scorns every kind of handy craft work. To buy every article from other countries, and to have, as it were, foreign nations for workmen, is so gratifying to republican pride, that although money is in the estimation of the Americans the only object worth living for, they disregard the advantages resulting from manu factures, they sell the raw material, and buy the manufactured articles at three times the value. To this pride we are indebted for those specimens of eloquence and sound judgment delivered some ten years ago in Congress, to the effect that \" the increase of manufactures is not to be encouraged, because the population would crowd to manu factories and produce all the evils attendant upon them, such as debility, sickness, or an enervated"], [243, "Chap. XVI L] 225 OF NORTH AMERICA. generation.\" Jonathan is aware that being with out money he can no longer sustain the part of a gentleman, and have his tradesmen in Europe ; he therefore sends a number of Yankee spies into the manufacturing districts of England, who acquire as much of the manufacturing system as they are permitted to do, and having thus ob tained sufficient information, he is beginning to establish manufactories after these models. Massachusets and Pennsylvania may be con sidered as taking the lead. The cotton and cloth manufactures of the former, already rival those of other nations. This latter State has now one hundred and thirty-six manufactories of different kinds : New York has nearly the same number. Pennsylvania excels in iron, cloth, and glass, al though the iron wares of this State, cannot yet vie with those of Great Britain. Of the glass and cloth manufactories, however, some are found, such as Bakewell and Co., in Pittsburgh, with others in Philadelphia and Lancaster, which are assuredly not inferior to the most improved esta blishments of the kind. American cloth and cotton goods are now worn even by fashionables, and the latter are beginning to be much in vogue. The advantage which the American commis- 9"], [244, "226 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XVII. sion merchant derives from the commerce with Great Britain, outweighs the interest he would otherwise take in patronising his own manu factures. He is mostly inclined to lay out his capital in mercantile undertakings, or in ship ping business, leaving internal improvement to foreigners. The government evince a great desire to pro mote the manufacturing establishments, and the tariff of 1824, has already contributed, in a great measure, to rouse a spirit of enterprise, and to direct it to that object. To foreign manufac turers possessing some capital, the United States can at no time offer so many inducements as at the present moment. The cheapness of every article of food, the low rate of wages, and the ready market presented by the Western States, will in fallibly secure success to such an undertaking. Two years ago Mr. B arrived in New York, from Great Britain. Wanting a new suit of clothes he was directed to a tailor in Water Street ; he goes there and has his measure taken, and in two days his dress is to be sent home. On the following morning he accompanies one of his friends, a respectable merchant in the city, to"], [245, "227 Chap. XVII.] OF NORTH AMERICA. visit the Mechanics Bank, where he meets his tailor, with whom his friend enters into close conversation, and who promises to send him next morning ten thousand dollars. \" What, for heaven's sake, has my tailor to do with the Bank ?\" asked Mr. B , who had listened to the colloquy. \" Very much indeed ! he is the president of it !\" A tailor, president of a bank, having a capital amounting to more than a mil lion of dollars, was a financial anomaly to the Englishman ; however, not a word of astonish ment escaped him. On the next day they went to the parade of a militia regiment, in which his friend held the rank of captain. The staff makes its appearance ; the young Englishman beholds his tailor dressed as a General, and commanding with such an air of authority, that on his return he exclaimed, \" I would rather go to the devil than to this tailor : I should not know how to address him.\" \" Well,\" replied Mr. C \" you address him as plain Mr. N and nothing more. To these functions our tailor adds another of no less importance, that of a member of the city council. He still carries on his business, and has lately taken a partner. Q 2"], [246, "228 [Chap. XVII. THE UNITED STATES Mr. W a tailor in the same city, was colonel of a militia regiment. When on the parade, and at the head of his regiment, he was asked by one of his officers \" whether his coat was ready ?\" \" You may ask me that question when I am in my workshop, now I am a General. You will give up your sword, and put yourself under ar rest.\" He did so to the no small satisfaction of his brother officers. Thus it is all over the Northern States ; and a coppersmith or a confectioner may keep one of the most fashionable houses, and receive the best company in the State, be elected a member of the Assembly, of the Senate, or of Congress, and in fact many of the legislative Solons are carpenters, potters, and masons. There is much sound judgment in all this. The American will always be found to proportion his esteem to the talents, the enterprise, and the success of an in dividual without distinction, although at first he may be distrustful and suspicious of the foreigner. The exemplary pastor will enjoy universal popu larity ; the eloquent speaker at the bar may be called his oracle ; while he looks at the mere lawyer, or preacher, with perfect indifference. Whosoever combines talents with industry,"], [247, "229 Chap. XVII. ] OF NORTH AMERICA. may be sure of meeting with patronage, and even with occasional pecuniary assistance. There is certainly not a nation whose citizens are less prejudiced against emigrants or foreign artists. The enterprising, active, and wealthy mechanic, ranks with the eminent lawyer in the Northern States, and may aspire to the most distinguished stations. In the Southern States the case is rather dif ferent, and lawyers, planters, and merchants, are treated with a decided preference. As however, fewer opportunities are afforded for mechanics to evince very high talents, the less so as their mental improvement is generally not of the high est order, they are kept (even in the north) in that class which is most suited to their situation in life. This is also the case in other countries, with this difference, that talents and persever ing industry may lead in the United States to wealth, and distinction, and offices ; whereas elsewhere the mechanic must always remain as he began.

Dis tillers, confectioners, cabinet-makers, and hatters, acquire an independence in a very few years, and an enterprising brewer, with a moderate capital of three thousand dollars, may depend upon being eventually successful, the more so, as the bever age called beer in the Union, is generally dele terious in the highest degree. Even tailors and shoemakers will frequently make a fortune ; the former assume commonly the more genteel name of merchant-tailors. Most of these people, es pecially if English, become rich in a few years, change their trade and turn speculators, buying and selling parcels of lands and houses. On the other hand, there are in Europe certain trades which are either unknown or would be very un successful in America. It may be taken as a rule, that trades and handicrafts connected with the immediate wants, will meet in every part of the Union with encou ragement and success ; but artists who are sub servient to the luxuries of life, are only in request"], [249, "231 Chap.

XVII I Chapter XVIII. Conclusion. Although there are in the United States no regular orders of society, yet as wealth is the standard by which the worth of every one is estimated, a higher respect is paid to those pro fessions which are most likely to attain it. These are the lawyer and the merchant. There is not a country where the influence of the former is greater, for as he is the sole expounder of the law, he will be often found to wrest it to his own selfish purposes, there being no supreme power to control his expositions. In the east, the clergy, notwithstanding their being entirely dependant on the people, have much influence, which shews that wherever wealth is accumulated, the esprit du corps is invariably the same. Though the United States exhibit a greater uniformity of manners than any other nation, yet there is still found a striking difference amongst them. In the eastern sea-ports you will find the manners of an European metropolis,"], [251, "Chap. XVIII. OF NORTH AMERICA. 233 alloyed by the pride of wealth, which, as it is the only mark of distinction, is not calculated to en courage courteous and social habits. In the central parts, from the Alleghany Mountains down to Cincinnati, a truly republican character is more than anywhere conspicuous. It is liberal, unassuming, hospitable, and independent. Fur ther on we find the half-cultivated indigence of a rising population. The different States themselves, vary not less in their characteristic features ; and a Yankee of Massachusets is in many respects as dissimilar to a Kentuckian, as the Irishman differs from a Scotch highlander. Situation, climate, and oc cupation, gradually lend a distinct feature to each separate State ; contending interests also contribute to establish a character which differs more or less with that of its neighbour. The ruling passion of the American is the love of money. Vain indeed would be the attempt to vindicate his character on this point ; with him, worldly prosperity and merit are in dissolubly connected. Something, however, may be conceded to this feeling, when it is considered as springing from the very nature of his public institutions ; for in the absence of artificial distinc-"], [252, "234 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XVIII. tions, wealth is the grand passport to public and private importance. Though this cupidity is certainly too far ex- tended, and a sordid love of money is every- where prevalent, yet it is but fair to state, that there is not a people on earth, who, when in pos- session of wealth, make a more beneficial and liberal use of it. An American, it its true, will consult his own interest ; he will not hesitate to sacrifice health and everything dear to him, and will even not be over-scrupulous in the se- lection of means to accomplish his purpose. But wealth obtained, he will not only contribute to the comfort of his family, but to that of the people in general ; he will not only advance the improvement of his immediate locality, and en- courage the institutions of his county or state, but with the same eagerness he will give his sub- scriptions to colleges and churches five hundred miles distant from his residence, and often in preference to those around him, if productive of more beneficial consequences. Thus, as we have stated, sprung up most of the literary institutions and churches in the north. There are a thou sand examples of this liberality. The liberality of the American, and, what is"], [253, "Chap. XVHL] 235 OF NORTH AMERICA. still better, his sound sense, is nowhere more striking than in the cities, and the public and private buildings of the United States. It is not the mere regularity, the rectangular main-streets, from sixty to one hundred and twenty feet wide, the straight lines of elegant brick buildings in the cities, of brick and frame houses in the towns and villages, which deserve admiration ; it is the strict regard, which, even in the most remote villages of the Union, is generally paid to the public health and comfort. The site of the town is either near a river, or in some other advantageous position : even a vil lage of one hundred houses has its market place. The elegant, though mostly simple court houses, the side-walks, and the general neatness which, notwithstanding a still visible insufficiency of means, is everywhere apparent, evince the soundest views, and the most correct judgment. It would be worse than narrowness of mind to expect from a country, only of a political ex istence of fifty years, the same splendour and comfort which the English capital and cities display, and which is the result of a liberal appli cation of a wealth accumulated during centuries. In this respect, English cities only are superior"], [254, "236 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XVIII. to the American. As you may discover the mo narch in the splendid palaces of the Tuilleries, Versailles, the Louvre, and in the magnificent royal squares and gardens of Paris, so the small est American village will serve to indicate that the sovereignty is in the people. The gorgeous and often whimsical palaces of royalty you would seek in vain in the United States ; but even Paris suffers in comparison with the airy, light, com fortable, and elegant American cities. Of these, New York is the most splendid. The Broadway, commanding on the one side a perspective view of the State House, and the vast expanse of waters, with the various islands on the other, is unrivalled for beauty, perhaps, in the whole world. It is not yet so imposing as Regent Street, or Rue de la Paix, but it is certainly more elegant. Boston is the most solid, as it is the most literary and refined city of the Union ; Philadelphia is the plainest and most aristocratic. Washington is laid out in the grandest style, though its comple tion will, perhaps, never be effected ; but even Baltimore, Richmond, New Albany, New Or leans, Cincinnati, are handsome cities. In these, as everywhere else, the enterprising spirit of the people is immense."], [255, "Chap. XVHL] 237 OF NORTH AMERICA. On my first tour to the grandest sight in na ture, the falls of Niagara, the road from Albany to the Cataract was nearly a wilderness. When I passed three years afterwards (1825), the whole line of the New York Canal teemed with an industrious population ; one spot was especially remarkable. In the space of three years, from a native forest it became an elegant little town, inhabited by eighteen hundred people*. The energy of the American, in this respect, is truly astonishing ; he will leave farm-house, home, friends, and everything, and seek a better abode. For this he will surmount every obstacle, face every danger, and no difficulty nor hardship deters him from attaining his ends. If he is not able to sell his property, he will let it lie waste, and eagerly repair to the better spot which pro mises more advantage and profit. Notwithstanding his adventurous enterprise, there is an economical spirit visible throughout, of which experience only can form an adequate idea. The American, in all his undertakings, goes at once to the main point ; he looks at the * I have forgotten the name of this place. It may, however, easily be discovered, as even in America it has excited a lively and very general interest."], [256, "238 THE UNITED STATES [Chap. XV11I principal end, and endeavours to obtain it in the cheapest way. This prudent economy is not only the result of a popular government, where its functionaries are strictly responsible for the public expenditure, it is in a greater degree the conse- quence of their origin. They were (as every nation is in the beginning) poor, and even com- paratively poorer than other nations. They brought with them when they emigrated to America, only the most necessary utensils of common life, and even of these an insufficient supply. Most of them had to wander into the interior of the trackless forests destitute of almost every requisite, and to live with their children without the most necessary articles of comfort. Thus they were accustomed to look at things which even much less enlightened nations cannot dispense with, as mere trifles, and that axiom of philosophy, \" The fewer the wants the greater the independence,\" was the practical result. The United States will never present the world with an Escurial, a Versailles, or a Winter Palace, but their improvements are of a more solid and of a more beneficial nature. On the Mississippi alone there are upwards of a hundred steam boats, more (with the exception of England)"], [257, "239 Chap. XV1IL] OF NORTH AMERICA. than the whole continent of Europe can boast of. They have begun the great national road from Washington to New Orleans, a distance of more than thirteen hundred miles, and which, when continued to Mexico, will be nearly three thousand. The canals of the Susquchannah, of Ohio, Delaware, &c, are in progress. The Lehigh coal mines alone are a work which would be creditable to England. These, and other public improvements, are carried on here in a spirit of liberal economy (if I may so speak) truly praise worthy. Instead of such immense fortresses as Ehrenbreitstein, Strasburgh, Cologne, Mentz, which consumed the income of a whole country for a series of years, there will be found the small forts in Louisiana, in the Delaware, in the Poto mack, for scarcely one thousand, and some for not more than five hundred men. But these forts are laid out on a plan, which proves, that though the Americans have not been brought up under a Vaughan, or in the military school at Brienne, that they know how to build fortresses suited to their purpose. This intelligence is still more strikingly dis played in the naval establishment of the Union, both mercantile and public. One must have"], [258, "240 [Chap. XV III. THE UNITED STATES seen an American man-of-war, have seen the elegant compactness of these vessels, the extreme order and alertness of their seamen, to judge of them accurately. Taken on the whole, the American national character is certainly aspiring, energetic, shrewd, and intelligent ; but this character, though re- spectable, is not altogether amiable. It is neither that of the steady, noble, and generous English, nor has it the sincerity nor the intense feeling of the German, nor the lively, and even in its levity, the still amiable disposition of the French. It exhibits the unnatural picture of a cold phi- losophical youth, united with the worst vice of age \u2014 avarice. There is not a nation, which, ab- stracted from its political institutions, has less friends, or whose intrinsic powers and excellent qualities have been more slighted and ridiculed by English writers. There is but one voice re- specting these insults from Boston down to New Orleans, from Washington to St. Louis, and it is that of bitter complaint. The fault is on both sides. It would be in vain to shelter the Ame- ricans from those faults and vices which we have already mentioned, and many of which we should not have expected from English descendants."], [259, "Chap. XVHL] OF NORTH AMERICA. 241 So it would be unreasonable to expect a very friendly disposition from two nations, the one of which is in possession of the commerce of the world, and of the dominion of the ocean, and the other which aspires to wrest this superiority from the grasp of Great Britain. But it must not be disguised that those Eng lish writers of travels, who speak of the United States, were generally prejudiced, and always not qualified to form a correct opinion of this rising and powerful nation. These writings exhibit, if not a total want of information, such an absence of that philosophical research so necessary to give Englishmen a correct idea of their shrewd and intelligent rival, that it is not to be wondered at that so much error and prejudice exist. The re sult has been highly injurious to the cause of truth and to the interests of Great Britain. Her leading Journals, adopting these opinions, have contributed by their systematic attacks to elevate and strengthen the national character of the Ame ricans, and to concentrate its energies against a country, whose most distinguished literary talents they see arrayed against their advancement. The national honour and the national feeling, which would for a while have slumbered, have awakened R"], [260, "242 [Chap. XV111 THE UNITED STATES to prove that such sarcasms are unmerited. He must personally have witnessed through a series of years, the exasperation, the rankling animosity, which these attacks, repeated in numberless news papers, have spread through millions of freemen, to be a fair judge of their powerful operation on the American character. They see themselves slighted by the only nation for whom they have a real esteem.
