Before the following pages were sent to the Press, a critic, who had been kind enough to read the manuscript, told me that under the disguise of a novel I had written, what he was pleased to term, an elaborate sneer at humanity. He also said that none of the characters had any sense of right or wrong, and that I suggested that nobody cared for such things now-a-days. This criticism astounded me. It was not my intention either to be satirical, or to hold up for the admiration of my readers the worse side of human nature. On the contrary, it had rather been my endeavour to show the great power of maternal affection as portrayed in the character of Geramis, and also to point out how all good qualities, not even excepting honour, are cap able of being destroyed by jealousy. Beyond this, I was not vain enough to attempt to teach any lesson. In regard to those chapters which relate to sport, I have done my best to prove that fox-hunting is the sovereign cure for all troubles and cares. In the November of 1886, I wrote an article which appeared in Land and Water on \" The History of Hunting,\" in which I pointed out not only the pleasures, but the political utility of field sports."], [10, "PREFACE. VI I feel sure that I cannot conclude this preface better than by quoting the last sentences in that article. \"Consider the social intercourse of the hunting field, and what it means ! The most aristocratic peers, the noblest ladies, are brought into equal companionship with the sporting farmer, even with the country peasant. It is one of the chief causes of the popularity of the upper classes, of the very existence of the class of country gentlemen. In these days of Socialism, when men desirous of cheap notoriety ignore patriotism in order to gain their own private advancement \u2014 when to set class against class is termed Radical policy instead of incitement to rebellion, no means by which good fellowship and genial friendship between the rich and the poor can be secured should be neglected. That fox-hunting helps to secure this end, I feel no doubt. I even do not hesi tate to assert that so long as fox-hunting endures, so long will all the classes of English society be safe together : the high from the blights of envy and the spoliation of rapacity, the low from the iron hand of oppression and the insolent spurn of con tempt.

The dessert had been cleared away, aud the cards and the spirits had made their appearance in Mr. Massinger's private apartment at the Hotel British, at San Francisco. Besides Mr. Massinger and his wife, there were three guests \u2014 two Americans, and one young Englishman travelling to see the coun try; these five were the occupants of the room. They had divided into two groups : one consisting of Mrs. Massinger and the Englishman, the other of Mr. Massinger and the two Americans. \" So you leave here to-morrow ? \" asked the lady, in a semi-audible tone. \"I am afraid I must, Jess,\" replied the other. \" I need not say how sorry I am, for you at all"], [14, "THE GREY DAWN AT SAN FRANCISCO. 2 events know the happy time I have had. Would that the end were not so near ! \" \" You will soon forget me.\" \"Never. How could I ? But we shall meet again, for you will write to me and tell me your movements, won't you, darling ? \" \"Yes.\" After a pause. \"Don't play to-night; there is no necessity; you can play ecarte with me.\" \" All right.\" This tete-a-tete, which, as far as the countenances of the speakers were concerned, might have been about the weather or some equally interesting sub ject, was put a stop to by Mr. Massinger. \" How shall we play ? Will you join us, Jess ? \" \" No, thanks. Mr. Lionel has challenged me to ecarte.\" \" You will have to play your best, then, Lionel. My wife can beat me easily.\" And Hugh Massin ger turned round towards the table, where the two Americans were already shuffling the cards. He was a tall, well-built, handsome man, with dark- blue eyes and coal-black hair. But his features were spoiled by a supercilious expression"], [15, "THE GREY DAWN AT SAN FRANCISCO. 3 of sarcasm, which was all the more remarkable, as he could not have been more than twenty-one or twenty-two years of age. He is a man without passions, would have been the verdict of a male observer ; he has no heart, a woman would have said. As a matter of fact, neither opinion would have beeu correct. Hugh Massinger had both passions and a heart ; but, although not twenty two, he had seen much of the world, of that world where a word said in the heat of the moment was only too often followed by a revolver bullet, and he had learnt to keep both his passions and his heart under the control of his reason. To be cool was his motto, and he had found it to his interest to act up to that motto. Insult him, and he would shoot you as calmly as he would gather up his winnings, or bear the reverses of the card-table. And yet he was somehow genial. Meanwhile his wife and young Lionel had com menced their game. Although the latter might be in love, it was evidently not the intention of his opponent that they should play for love. Gold soon was seen on the little table in the corner where they were playing ; and tho pile by the side"], [16, "THE GREY DAWN AT SAN FRANCISCO. 4 of the lady grew large, while that by the side of the man grew proportionately small. Perhaps the young Englishman found some compensation in the glances which fell from her eyes, in the occasional touches of their hands, and the soft words with which she favoured him whenever the conversation at the other table was loud enough to permit of her doing so. She was a woman for the sake of whose love many men would have consented to be duped ; but no woman ever yet loved the man whom she was robbing of his money. Walter Lionel never dreamt that the voluptuous creature, for whom he had been professing a violent passion for the last week, had merely been decoying him into gambling. In the inexperience of his youth he fancied she loved him, and did not consider that a gambler's wife is ne cessarily the partner of her husband. So the world wags on. Love makes fools of all of us, and youth has to buy its experience. Pity that it should so often be bought too late. \" Good gracious ! it is past twelve. I must be retiring. You will come and see me in the morning before you go, Walter ? \""], [17, "THE GREY DAWN AT SAN FRANCISCO. 5 And Mrs. Massinger left the room. \" Will you play a rubber, Lionel ? It is not too late,\" inquired his host. Walter Lionel had been playing cards at the Massingers' every night for the past week. He had been staying in the same hotel, and had at first ac cepted the invitation in order to make the acquaint ance of the beautiful woman he had seen in the public rooms ; but he had paid dearly for it. To Mrs. Massinger alone he had lost over two thousand dollars, to her husband considerably more ; and he knew that the next day he must return to England, because he had not sufficient funds to continue his journey.. With the blind hope of a gambler, he ventured his remaining money on the luck of the cards that night, and after three rubbers got up from the table absolutely without a dollar. \" Won't you go on and have your revenge ? \" \" Not to-night, thanks. I am cleaned out com pletely. Not a dollar left,\" he replied half-angi-ily. \"Oh! I am very sorry,\" said Massinger; aud leaving the table where the other two were still sitting, he added in a low tone, \" If you are in a mess, don't hesitate to come to me in the morning.\""], [18, "THE GREY DAWN AT SAN FRANCISCO. 6 Unfortunately Lionel saw at that moment a contemptuous smile on the face of one of the two Americans, both of whom were regarding him stead fastly, and the whole truth flashed across him on the instant. Massinger and his wife had merely used him as a pigeon. A hasty conclusion, but a true one. \" You are very kind,\" he replied coolly. \" I wished to buy the love of your wife, and so expected to be obliged to pay her husband a big price.\" Massinger only smiled as he took up a tumbler from the table, and dashed the contents into the face of the speaker. The two Americans looked on half-interested, half-amused; they were perfectly accustomed to these scenes, and perfectly ready to act as seconds in the one which must ensue. Life is not considei*ed of much value in San Fran- cisco. There were few preliminaries to settle. The time was the immediate one, the place within a mile of the hotel. Thither they walked, Massinger and his second going first. The signal was given; both men fired at the same moment, and without a cry Lionel fell down dead."], [19, "THE GREY DAWN AT SAN FRANCISCO. 7 A small round hole in the forehead was all that showed the cause. \" You are my witnesses, of course,\" said Massin ger, \" though it is not very likely that anything will come of it.\" And the three men walked back to the hotel. Such was the death of Walter Lionel, shot on ac count of his passion for gambling, and his love for a gambler's wife. Left dead on the plain outside San Francisco, thousands of miles from his native home. Such was the fruit of his folly. In his blind conceit he had thought himself a man of the world, because in his pursuit of pleasure he had forgotten the love of his mother, whose idol he had been, the love of his father whose heir he was, and the affectionate worship of his sisters, and that fair curly-headed little brother, whom in days gone by he had been used to pet. What would be their feel ings when they leai*nt that he, their pride and hope, had been shot for making love to another man's wife ? Had he thought of them when he stood up in the grey dawn of that early morning to meet death in the vigour of his early manhood ? Perhaps so. He is dead; pity him, but take warning."], [20, "THE GREY DAWN AT SAN FRANCISCO. 8 When Hugh MassiDger got back to his hotel, he did not go to bed, but went into his sitting-room, and, lighting a cigar, settled down to think over the adventures of the night. It was not the first duel in which he had taken a principal part, and if the truth must be told, he felt little, if any, remorse. He could not have acted otherwise than he had done ; when in Rome one must do as Rome does, and the customs of San Francisco demanded that he should shoot a man who at once impliedly ac cused him of dishonesty and his wife of infidelity. AVhat troubled him was that he might gain an unen viable notoriety from the affair. There is no smoke without fire, is an old but a very true proverb ; and Massinger wisely thought that if it were known that he had been accused of cheating at cards, and using his wife as a deco}*, he might not find life so pleasant as it might be. He must decamp, aud go in search of other hunting-grounds. It never struck him that his wife might have grown fond of the man he had killed. He had just arrived at the determination to leave San Francisco that same day, when the door opened and Jessie Massinger entered the room. Although"], [21, "THE GREY DAWN AT SAN FRANCISCO. 9 hardly more than a girl in years, she was a superbly beautiful woman, of that dashing style which has so often been compared to a full-blown rose. She had a peculiarly graceful movement when she walked, such as is only found in women who have lived a free open-air life in their childhood and girlhood ; a movement which clearly shows that there is no exertion to the limbs. Her figure was fiuely de- veloped, of which, from the care she took to display it, she was evidently aware. In a word, she was one of those women who are aptly described as sensually voluptuous. Hugh Massinger had met her some six months before at a Mexican store, where he had stayed for a week. He was enchanted with her bare brown legs, as she ran about doing her daily work; and she fell in love with him because he had a handsome face, and was kinder in his manners to her than the rough planters to whom she had been accustomed. He liked to pass the sunny afternoons lying by her side in the long grass, and kissing her soft cheeks and lips, and she liked to be kissed. When the time came for him to leave, he had little difficulty in persuading her to accompany him. He could not afford, however, to keep her in idleness ;"], [22, "THE GREY DAWN AT SAN FRANCISCO. 10 she must work as he did; and so they became partners in gambling, for he was a professional gambler. All went well for a month, when one day, to his surprise, she insisted on his marrying her. She was too useful for him to leave her, and, as she herself did not hesitate to say, knew too much about him for him to offend her with impunity. So they were legally married, and after five months of in cessant travel from place to place, and varied suc cess in regard to their industry, they had found themselves at San Francisco, with a rich young Englishman ready at hand to pluck. How they had availed themselves of the opportunity is known. \" Oh, Jess ! \" said the man, taking his cigar from between his lips, \" we must pack up our luggage and leave here to-day.\" \" Why, Hugh ? What is the matter now ? \" \" Well, the long and short of it is, that that young fool Lionel saw through our little game. Unfortunately for him he was ass enough to tell me so.\" \" You don't mean to say you have shot him ? \" \" Why all this interest ? Of course I did. It was a fair duel, though ; I didn't shoot him like a"], [23, "THE GREY DAWN AT SAN FRANCISCO. 11 dog on the spot, as I should have had a perfect right to do, according to San Francisco law.\" \" Oh ! vei-y fair, I've no doubt. What odds did it make whether you shot him in this room or in the open air ? You knew what chance he would have against you. Something like a thousand to one, I should guess. You cheated him at cards, and then murdered him for telling you so. That is the truth of the matter. We need not deceive one another, at all events. But look here, Hugh Mas singer, when I married you, I was willing to become your partner in business as far as the cards were concerned, but if you make murder your business, I shan't join you.\" \" You use hard words, my fine lady. But, if a man tells me to my face that he has consented to be duped by me, as a means of paying me for the love of my wife, he must bear the consequences.\" \" You lie; Walter Lionel never told you so.\" \"Yes, he did,\" said Massinger; and turning quietly round to his companion, he added : \" Did he lie ? \" \" Oh ! you suspect me, do you ? Well, I have finned pretty considerably for your sake, so if I sin"], [24, "THE GREY DAWN AT SAN FRANCISCO. 12 occasionally for my own it is not for you to call ms to account.\" '- By G , it is though. You refused to remain my servant, and forced me to marry you, so you must fulfil your part ofthe bargain.\" Jessie Massinger threw herself back iu the arm chair, and laughed immoderately. \" Indeed ! And suppose I don't fulfil my part of the bargain, what then, my virtuous lord and husband ? \" \" I shall either leave you, or compel you to do so ; whichever best suits my convenience.\" \" Will you ? We shall see about that. You tell me to flirt with a man, and then are angry because you think I carried the flirtation too far. If I am to make love at your bidding, I shall please myself how I do it. And what is more, I won't allow you to shoot my lovers. AValter Lionel, let me tell you, was an infinitely better man than you. He was a gentleman, at all events.\" \" And I am not. You might just as well have finished the speech. AVhat a pity I did shoot him; he was going to-day, and might have taken you with him. Let me see, it is about six months"], [25, "THE GREY DAWN AT SAN FRANCISCO. 13 since I found you serving liquors to your father's customers. You have soon learnt to discriminate in regard to gentlemen. Very soon, I must say.\" \" Yes ; and I distinguish between an honest man and a thief and a murderer.\" \" I am sorry you couldn't do so six months ago. However it is not too late now.\" \" I am perfectly aware of that. I shall please myself, you may be sure. Your system of education is not likely to make a fool of any woman.\" \"Well, I am getting tired of this little scene; and as I am master for the present, perhaps you will go and pack, as I told you to at first.\" \" Master ! are you ? I advise you not to try that tack with me. You had better go and pack up the things yourself. It is owing to you that we have got to go.\" \" Are you goiDg to do as I told you, or not ? For I am not going to have this folly any longer.\" And he got up from the chair and walked towards her. \"No more am I. By Heaven, if you touch me, I'll make you repent it.\" He took her by the arm, and dragged her out of"], [26, "THE GREY DAWN AT SAN FRANCISCO. 14 the chair. \" When you are another man's mistress you can please yourself; but so long as you're mine I'll make you obey me.\" And he pushed her towards the door. But he had roused the hot Mexican blood which flowed in her veins. \" You coward,\" she hissed out ; \" take that,\" and she struck him across the face with all her strength. It was the work of a moment. He did not strike her. To do him justice he was too much of a man ever to strike a woman in cold blood. And he had the sense still to remain cool even under the provocation she had just given him. He took her in his arms and carried her into her bedroom, where he placed her on the bed. Then, standing over her, he made her, trembling now with fear of his superior strength, listen to what he had to say. They were the stern words of a man whose will was of cast iron ; words the sarcasm of which cut through the mind of the woman ; words which she was never likely to forget, or to forgive. After he had finished he locked the door, which opened on to the passage of the hotel, and went into the sitting-room to smoke another cigar."], [27, "THE GREY DAWN AT SAN FRANCISCO. 15 \"Damn her,\" he muttered to himself; \"she loved me once and her love made her obey me; now she hates me and will no longer do what I want her. Fool that I was to fall in love with her ; it serves me right. Doubly fool ever to give her the hold of marriage over me. AVell, if I can't bend her to my love, she must bend to my will.\" He would have doubted the power of his will, if he had heard the words she used when he had left her room. But she packed up his things. Three weeks later Hugh Massinger was sitting1 in a drinking saloon in a remote part of California, talking to a Britisher. To judge by their conversa tion they were old acquaintances. \" I heard you had been spliced since I saw you last.\" \" Yes, I was. But I am carrying on business on mv own account now.\""], [28, "16 CHAPTER II. \"FORTY MINUTES ON THE GRASS W1TH0DT A CHECK.\" If a southerly wind and a cloudy sky proclaim it a hunting morning, the followers of the South Grass-shire fox-hounds had nothing to complain of on the score of weather, when they met one Feb ruary morning at the White Court finger-post, the surest find in the country. It was a large field, and, as the huntsman remarked to the first whip, one which would require a lot of weeding. All the well-known faces in the hunt seemed to be out ; and the eye of a keen sportsman would not have found much difficulty in discerning who were most likely to be well up at the death. There were some half-dozen who looked as if they were certain to bo iu it. First of all there is a group of three, two men chatting to a girl ; they all look like business. The girl in her well-fitting habit, \u2014 why is it that there"], [29, "\" FORTY MINUTES ON THE GRASS.\" 17 are hardly three meu in the country who can make a habit to fit? \u2014 sits that bay thoroughbred as if she were used to him, which indeed she is ; and if he can go as well as he looks, they will be hard to beat. Certainly if a girl be a good horsewoman she never looks so well as when in the saddle ; and Aura Belgart was a good horsewoman. Yet there are donkeys, who are continually braying asinine hee haws against the appearance of ladies in the hunting field ; what a blessing that we can afford to treat them with contemptuous silence, only advising them to ride the animals they resemble. Both the men have good hunting seats, and appear well mounted; but there is a look of vice in the grey which the slighter of the two is on, and which prophesies to give his rider some little trouble ; still, Captain Stanhope has the reputation of having as good hands as any man who ever rode between the flags. When he can get leave in the hunting season, he comes down into Grass-shire to stay with his elder brother, who mounts him on the horses which he can't ride himself. At the present moment he seems to wish the dark-moustached man on the big chestnut at Jericho, or Jupiter, or the moon, or any- c"], [30, "\"FORTY MINUTES ON THE GRASS.\" 18 where but at the side of the auburn-haired girl on the bay. Who is the fair, curly-headed boy in mufti, chatting to an old, benevolent-looking gentleman on foot ? He can't be more than eighteen, yet he looks as if he had been born in the saddle. Many an older man envied the firm seat and delicate hands of little Chippy Lionel as he was always called. He is a cousin of the girl with the auburn hair, and is supposed to be reading with a private tutor at Haysey in Grass-shire. But as his uncle, Sir Henry Belgart, lives within three miles of that town, Chippy does him the favour of riding his horses as often as he conveniently can. His walk ing weight is just over nine stone, so unless Chippy comes hopelessly to grief, he is generally to be found near to the hounds. The little old benevolent-looking gentleman is the walking prodigy of the hunt. Nearly every hunt has a walking prodigy of some sort, a man who walks to the meet and follows the hounds for miles on foot. Mr. Timothy Pipkin was the prodigy of the South Grass-shire. He lived in a little house in Haysey, was known to be a great naturalist and"], [31, "\" FORTY MINUTES ON THE GRASS.\" 19 somewhat of an antiquarian, walked to every meet within walking distance, and was a gentleman. Everybody liked him, and everybody invited him to their houses. There are several others who seem as if they could go. There are four or five sporting farmers, who combine horse-dealing with farming ; they will ride at anything, and always manage to get over somehow : then the people who buy their horses from them wonder why they can't do the same, for getting that these men are in the saddle riding over their farms every day* of the week, almost every hour of the day. There is the wife of the master, the most popular person in the hunt, she has three hundred guineas beneath her, and will require catching. Last of all, there is the master himself. He looks the perfect picture of what he is \u2014 a country English gentleman on horseback. And what better picture could one have ? Mark him as he stands there in the midst of his hounds, giving final directions to his huntsman, and own with pride that no country in Europe can show a finer sight. But the hounds are moving off to a covert on the"], [32, "\"FORTY MINUTES ON THE GRASS.\" 20 left, a field from the road, where everybody but the hunt servants remain in eager expectation. Hush ! was that a whimper? Yes; no false alarm. One blow of the horn, two or three more whimpers\u2014 the sweetest of all music, the hounds are out of covert. Forrad ! Away ! See how the best men go immediately to the front. The dark-moustached man on the big chest nut is first over the fence out of the road. Miss Belgart and Chippy, who generally sticks pretty close to his cousin, take it side by side. The grey* follows, and then, laying down his head, does his best to bolt. The road is already more than half deserted, and for the first three fields it is a race for a place with nearly a hundred and fifty starters. The big chestnut is not caught, nor has his rider any intention that he should be, as, bending slightly forward in the saddle, he gallops him across the fields, letting him take his fences in his stride. \"By Jove 1 he is making straight for Bradley gorse. Seven miles, with hardly au earth, even,\" says Chippy, as he negotiates a bullfinch, half a length ahead of his cousin."], [33, "\"FORTY MINUTES ON THE GRASS.\" 21 \"No! Is he?\" And her cheeks are already flushed with excitement. They are in the same field with the hounds now, but only for a moment; there is timber to be negotiated. Watch that wiry little whip, the per fection of a rider. How he pulls iu his bony horse within twenty yards of the place. Till then ha seemed as if he were going to charge it like a steam engine. Whoa, gently ; and the bony horse hops over like a cat. Rap, rap. Chippy looks round. Captain Stan hope and the grey are alongside; the latter with his head down and the bit well between his teeth. \" Knocked it with every leg he has. I can only sit down and let him go.\" \" You won't pass the hounds, old man, so it don't make much odds. Ye gods, what a scent ! This pace will thin them a bit, I bet.\" And Chippy turned round in his saddle to review the field. \" Put the pace on. There is a tremendously wide ditch ou the other side. I told you so. Arthur has just come to grief.\" Aura Belgart touched the bay with her spur, and landed well into the other field, where she saw the"], [34, "\"FORTY MINUTES ON THE GRASS.\" 22 unfortunate huntsman trying to get his horse out of the ditch. No need to put the pace on with the grey. He had only to rise, and he could have cleared a river. \" By Jove ! we are in the river meadows. Do you see the willows ? They are making straight for the brook. We shall either have to jump it or swim it,\" said Stanhope. \" AArill is putting that bony brute at it. He can never get him over. AAratch Bertie Muirsom. It is a race which of them will take it first. Doesn't Bertie go well ? See how he increases the pace as he comes down to the water. A good dig of the spurs that. He's over \u2014 no, he isn't \u2014 yes, he is.\" There had not been a foot to spare ; hardly an inch, for the matter of that. The chestnut had been. obliged to make two or three efforts with his hind legs, and it took him some yards before he re covered his stride. \" I say, Aura, are you sure that bay can do it ? \" But eighteen feet of water did not stop Aura Belgart. Poor Chippy did not fare so well, however. Anxiety to spe how his cousin got over prevented"], [35, "\"FORTY MINUTES ON THE GRASS.\" 23 him putting on the pace till he was within thirty yards, when he put it on too suddenly. The horse half refused, and then jumped short, with the result that Chippy found himself over head in water. \" All right ; go on ! No bones broken,\" he shouted to his cousin, who was pulling up to see if he were hurt. Then, left to himself and dripping from head to foot, it is to be feared that he used some very unparliamentary language as he tried to help his horse out. He had lost his place in the best run of the season, so it was pardonable. His horse was lame, and he had to ride to Belgart Towers, where he was going to dine, and where his dress clothes had been sent from his tutor's. His only consolation was that he saw two farmers in the same plight as himself. The grey had got over, but his fall was only delayed. They were going up a hill, at the top of which was a huge bullfinch, too big for any horse to negotiate. The only place was a stile. But stiles could hardly be called the grey's strong point. In spite of all his rider could do in his half-blown condition, he wouldn't rise, and, knocking the top bar heavily just below his knees, came sprawling"], [36, "\"FORTY MINUTES ON THE GRASS.\" 24 on to his head, nearly rolling over Captain Stan hope. No use going on. AArith that off fore leg, there was only one place to go to, and that was home. But what enraged the captain the most was that there was now no chance for him of a tete-a-tete with Aura Belgart, while there was a very strong chance for Bertie Muirsom. Still, he was going to dine at Belgart Towers that evening. So was Bertie Muirsom ; but the captain was happily ignorant of the fact. The wiry whip, the big chestnut, Aura Belgart, and a farmer, were the only four in the same field. The brook had proved too big au obstacle for those who had managed to remain on anything like good terms with hounds. The pace had been terrific \u2014 equal to a steeplechase. Oh, for a welcome check, if only for a minute. On and off, over a bank with a ditch on either side, and hounds are making straight towards a flock of sheep. Two more minutes, and, for the first time during the run, they are at fault. \" Twenty minutes without a check,\" said Aura looking at her watch."], [37, "\"FORTY MINUTES ON THE GRASS.\" 25 \" And I for one am glad of it now it's come. I think we've managed to thin the field, Miss Bel gart.\" \" Yes ; poor Chippy got half-drowned in the brook,\" she replied, patting her horse's neck. \"And Captain Stanhope got a nasty fall at the stile.\" \" Thank goodness for that,\" muttered Muirsom under his breath. \" No need for a cast, sir. Daisy has it. Whoap, my beauty. That's right. Forrad ! forrad ! \" No time for the field to come up ; hardly more than breathing time for the first flight. But Bradley gorse gets nearer and nearer ! once inside there and Mr. Reynard is safe. He knows it, cunning creature; and he knows it is those sheep he will have to thank if he saves his life. They are only four fields from the gorse now ; but Will views him in the next field, and presses on his hounds. \"He looks dead beat; but he is running pluckily. Forrader ! forrader ! \" They are in the same field. Poor Reynard ! It"], [38, "\"FORTY MINUTES ON THE GRASS.\" 26 is with difficulty he can drag himself through the next fence. But he does, and only a hundred yards separate him from his goal. Fifty, twenty, ten \u2014 he must be able to feel the breath of his pursuers. It is no good ; he can't get over the bank. \" AVhoap ! \" He gnashes his little white teeth, and determines to sell his life dearly. He dies as pluckily as he has run, without a cry. \" Thirty-five minutes from find to kill.\" \" And over seven miles from point to point.\" '\u25a0\u25a0 Splendid ! \" But where does this crowd of horsemen spring from so suddenly ? They could not have been within ten fields of hounds during the run. Cer tainly not ; but they could judge the line the fox was taking, and make for Bradley gorse accordingly. Or if one man alone knew it, it would be sufficient ; he would be sure to have a host of followers. I remember once a man, w*ell known in the Mid lands, who always took his own line and detested being followed, relating a trick he once played on his pursuers. Directly he heard the horn, he cantered off home, followed by a fairly large crowd,"], [39, "\"FORTY MINUTES ON THE GRASS.\" 27 whose dismay when he told them he was absolutely ignorant of the whereabouts of the hounds, was so great as to rid him of the nuisance of their company for ever. To-day they effectually prevented any tete-a-tete between Aura Belgart and Bertie Muirsom. Those who were fortunate enough to possess second horses, now tried to find them. Flasks and sandwich-cases made their appearance, and there was the usual medley of conversation which always takes place after a kill. \" AVhere did you get to, old fellow ? I never saw you after that third bullfinch with the ditch on the taking-off side.\" \"Didn't you? I looked back and saw you, as we were going down towards the brook.\" Doubtless hunting is, as Burke described it, one of the balances of the constitution, and has an extremely exhilarating and healthy effect on the mind. But it provokes a fair amount of jealousy for all that. Who is not fond of boasting of that marvellous place he negotiated in such and such a run, or how on such a day he was absolutely lead ing the field ? Nobody believes him ; but what"], [40, "\"FORTY MINUTES ON THE GRASS.\" 28 does he care ? Is not the recollection of a good run nearly, if not quite as enjoyable as the run itself? Neither Sir Henry Belgart nor his daughter had second horses out ; and the bay for one had cer tainly had quite enough of it. So they were forced to turn home with some few others who were in the same situation as themselves ; but not till Aura's bridle was decorated with the brush. \" I must get a bit of him, if it is only because we were about the only two well in it.\" Aud Muirsom went up to the whip to endeavour to secure the head, which he subsequently got mounted in its death agony. Then, although he had a second horse ready at hand for him, he trotted on to over take Sir Henry Belgart and his daughter. Yes; there could be no doubt about it. Bertie Muirsom, the hardest rider and the keenest sports man in the South Grass-shire, was in love ; pretty deeply too, since he could give up the chance of a second run in the afternoon, in order to ride part of the way home by the side of his mistress. But was his love returned ? AVho can tell ? The feminine heart has always beeu a mystery to man"], [41, "\" FORTY MINUTES ON THE GRASS.\" 29 since the days of Helen in spite of the multitude of Parises who pretend to a knowledge of it. At all events, Aura confined her conversation during that ride home to hunting matters, and her com panion had not a chance of getting on more delicate topics. \" Good-bye, Miss Belgart; good-bye, Sir Henry.\" \"Good-bye; or rather au revoir, for we shall see you at dinner, shan't we?\" \"Certainly; thanks.\" And Bertie Muirsom trotted on by himself. Sir Henry Belgart and his daughter tui'ned off the main road, and jogged up a small bye-lane at that slow trot which a hunting man, or rather his horse, invariably adopts after a long run. He was unusually silent to-day, nor did Aura break the silence. If any one had seen his fine athletic form, as he rode along on this February afternoon, with his firm seat, which few horses could disturb, they would have considered him a man to be envied; more especially when they regarded the beautiful girl by his side whom it was his lot to protect. But Sir Henry's state of mind at the present moment was far from enviable ; it was the same old"], [42, "\"FORTY MINUTES ON THE GRASS.\" 30 reason, money, or rather the want of it, which was causing him anxiety. His father had died when he was but a boy of some eighteen or nineteen summers, and he had suddenly found himself heir to an ancient baronetcy, and a rent-roll of fifteen thousand a year. Having been brought up to look on sport as his chief occupation iu life, with nobody to advise him, it was only natural that he should go on to the turf; so he kept a large racing stud for three or four years, till he was persuaded that a certain splendid-looking silly of his would win the Oaks, and that a filly belonging to a friend wouldn't. Unfortunately the friend's filly did win, and Sir Henry's losses in consequence were so great, that he was obliged to mortgage his estates heavily, in order to meet his debts of honour. Shortly after this he fell in love with the daughter of a country clergyman, whose face was her only fortune. He married her, and she persuaded him to sell his racehorses and retire from the turf. He might even then have spent the rest of his life in ease and happiness as a country gentleman, but that two years after the marriage Lady Belgart died,"], [43, "\"FORTY MINUTES ON THE GRASS.' 31 giving birth to a daughter. This daughter, Aura, was the only being on earth for whom Sir Henry had now the least affection. But in her childhood days his affection for her had not been strong enough to prevent him resuming his old racing habits : and in his second venture as in his first he found but ill-success. So he had gone on borrowing money, till his estates were mortgaged up to the hilt. Besides, he had always kept up a big establishment at his country seat at Belgart Towers; always had his stables full of the best hunters money could buy, and the spare bedrooms occupied by any of his friends who cared to enjoy his hospitality. In short, he had been living far beyond his income. He could not go on as he had been, that was certain ; he had only that morning received a letter from his solicitor, in reply to one of his own, saying it was impossible for him to think of raising auy more money on mortgage ; in fact, that the arrears of interest on the mortgages already in existence were very heavy, and that he was afraid Sir Henry would have to sell. This last course was the very one Sir Henry was most averse to, for he was a proud"], [44, "\"FORTY MINUTES ON THE GRASS.\" 32 man, whose chief source of pride lay in his inherit- ance. He knitted his brows more deeply as they entered the park, and Belgart Towers became visible, where it lay amongst the old elms with which it was surrounded ; and with an oath which, if it could have been realized, would have saved him all further annoyance from his creditors, muttered below his breath, \" Sell the Towers ! Never in this life.\" Sir Henry's ruminations were, however, cut short by their arrival at the stables, where they found Chippy ridiculously attired in an old suit of the baronet's."], [45, "CHAPTER III. A DINNER-PARTY AT BELGART TOWERS. Chippy Lionel and Aura were firm pals, and always thoroughly enjoyed each other's company. She had his entire confidence : he told her all his peccadillos, and they were many, and all his boyish schemes. He told her the last tradesman's daughter in the town of Haysey he had been spooning, and the last lecture he had had from his tutor. For Chippy was far from being what fond mothers would call a model boy : however, as yet, he was free from vice. If he did like to go up every evening to that green hill outside Haysey to kiss and flirt with Polly Marjar or Annie Leymed, what harm was there ? They were innocent flirtations enough, and what boy who has been at a private tutor's has not gone through them, and enjoyed them with infinitely keener pleasure than those less innocent ones with choristers, divorcees, and grass widows, with which in his manhood he has amused himself? Low tastes, o3 D"], [46, "A DINNER-PARTY AT BELGART TOWERS. 34 savouring of immorality ; perhaps so, but essentially human. At all events, Chippy Lionel had them, and did not hesitate to make a confidante of his cousin in regard to them. Boys always love to have some girl to whom they can tell all their doings, with whom they can have a confidential platonic friend ship ; and Chippy was no exception to the rule. He had two sisters, certainly; but they were both married women, much older than he was. Aura was only a year older, just old enough to give him advice, which he loved to hear, but never followed. But on this particular afternoon Aura had all the various duties of a hostess to perform, those hun dred and one little things which must be seen to before a dinner-party. Not that dinner-parties were few and far between at Belgart Towers; on the contrary ; but that only made Aura's duties more numerous, even if she was accustomed to them. So after lunch, Chippy was left to his own devices ; for Sir Henry had shut himself up in his study. He might have walked back to his tutor's and worked all the afternoon; but he was not fond of work at any time, and he was going up to London after Easter to read for the bar, so he had come to the conclusion"], [47, "A DINNER-PARTY AT BELGART TOWERS. 35 that all other reading was mere waste of time ; besides, he would probably meet one of his rustic loves on the way, and the baronet's clothes made him look slightly ridiculous; so he contented him self with smoking innumerable cigarettes and strumming operatic airs on the morning-room piano. In the meanwhile Sir Henry is endeavouring to calculate how he can avoid selling Belgart Towers. It was a difficult problem to solve, or rather it would only be solved in one way ; aud that way was that Aui'a should marry a man with money. She would have all he possessed when he died, including the Towers, so his son-in-law would see they were not sold. But although Sir Henry was undeniably a selfish man, he was fully determined that his daughter should not be sacrificed at the altar of mammon. At the present time there could be no doubt that both Captain Stanhope and Bertie Muirsom were paying her a good deal of attention. The one was a younger son, and poor in proportion, the other had the reputation of possessing twenty thousand a year. But the Baronet was wise enough to know that any influence of his might have a"], [48, "A DINNER-PARTY AT BELGART TOWERS. 36 contrary effect to what he desired, unless exercised with extreme caution. They were both coming to dinner that night ; he \"would wait and see if any thing happened which might give him a clue to act upon. Dinner-parties at the Towers always went off well. They were neither too formal nor too big. Twelve is quite sufficient for any dinner, Sir Henry used to say, and he never would exceed that number. He always used a round dining-table, because it was more sociable ; whether it was King Arthur or anybody else' who invented the round table, the thanks of society are due to the inventor : for it prevents conversation being confined, which, al though in some instances it may be pleasant, be comes exceedingly irksome if the lady whom you have been told off to take in to dinner is not a congenial spirit. An epicure of the most discrimi nating taste, it need hardly be said that Sir Henry's cook was an artiste, and the contents of his cellar the choice of a connoisseur. \"If a man asks you to take pot luck,\" he used to say, \" you should be content with whatever he gives you to eat ; but there is no excuse for him if he gives you a bottle of bad"], [49, "A DINNER-PARTY AT BELGART TOWERS. 37 wine, for he ought not to have such a thing in his house.\" To-night it was a regular sporting dinner. During the season Sir Henry used to dine in hunt dress, an example which such of his guests as were hunting men used to follow. For why should a man never wear the dress which becomes him most except on one or two gala occasions, such as hunt balls ? The run of the morning formed the chief subject of talk; fences were jumped over again, and Chippy shivered as he related his accident at the brook. The gentlemen had rejoined the ladies after coffee and the much-prized cigarette ; four devotees had settled down to a rubber, some lady was making Chippy turn over the leaves of a sentimental song, which she was singing in the ordinary drawing-room fashion, that is to say very feebly, with an expression resembling a dying duck in a thunderstorm ; and Wilson Stanhope had so far got the better of Bertie Muirsom, that he was enjoying a tete-a-tete with Aura on the sofa. Apart from love to the superficial observer it would be a good match for Stanhope if he were to marry Miss Belgart; for by those who were ignorant"], [50, "A DINNER-PARTY AT BELGART TOWERS. 38 of the real financial state of her father's affairs, she was looked upon as an heiress. Amongst the ignorant was Stanhope. He was not a fortune hunter, but he was a younger son with all the ex travagant tastes of the army, and knew full well the wisdom of the old advice, Don't marry for money, but marry where money is. He was very much in love, much deeper than he himself thought. He had argued the whole matter over in his own mind, and had come to the conclusion that if Aura would have him she should; but then, like most men, he did not care about proposing till he was sure of being accepted, forgetting \" nothing venture, nothing win.\" There is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune ; put \" love \" in the place of the word \" men,\" and the proverb would exactly meet Wilson Stanhope's case. If he had had the courage to propose that evening, he would probably have been accepted, and saved himself much subsequent trouble. As it was he only showed his passion to Sir Henry, who mentally de termined that he should not have an opportunity of declaring it ; to Aura, who wondered perhaps why"], [51, "A DINNER-PARTY AT BELGART TOWERS. 39 he didn't ; aud to Bertie Muirsom, who inwardly swore that he never should if he could help it. Oh ! thou chubby winged boy, whom we all worship, some of us too well, but, alas ! not too wisely*, what jealousy, what falsehood hast thou brought into the world ! So before Aura Belgart went to sleep that night she had made up her mind that Wilson Stanhope was only a male flirt. \" He is fooling you passer le temps,\" said consci ence. But conscience for once was wrong. The moral, male reader, is this ; in love, as in everything else in this life, it is best to strike while the iron is hot."], [52, "40 CHAPTER IV. A SUNDAY AFTERNOON. The end os the hunting season was rapidly ap proaching, and it would soon be time to put away the buckskins and pink coat till the arrival of an other November. Oh, bitter farewell, though it only be for six months. Bitter even to those men whose sole occupation in life is pleasure, who go through a round of dissipation for three months in London, and then shoot grouse in August, part ridges iu September, and pheasants in October; doubly bitter to those men who of necessity are buried alive in the country during the summer months. Their favourite amusement gene, they are certainly deserving of pity. In South Grass -shire the grand^n-ifo always came iu the shape of the Haysey Hunt steeplechases. Lovers of racing, who never miss the Grand National, and are always to be seen at Sandown"], [53, "A SUNDAY AFTERNOON. 41 Park, might laugh at the meeting ; but lovers of sport always found plenty to satisfy them. The South Grass-shire Hunt Cup, restricted to horses who had followed the South Grass-shire hounds, was the event of the day. Although \" owners up \" was not a rule of the meeting, it was very seldom that anybody took the trouble to engage a professional rider. What was the good ? There were plenty ot men iu South Grass-shire who could ride between the flags as well as across a country. On the afternoon of the Sunday preceding the races, there was a large party collected at Bertie Muirsom 's bachelor's hunting box, to talk over the various contingencies in reference to the races. Sir Henry Belgart and his daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Stanhope and the Captain, Chippy Lionel, and a fellow-pupil of his, were all there. Bertie Muir som's was just the house to drop into on a Sunday afternoon. An excellent bottle of claret, a good cigar, and a turn round the stables, with a cup of tea or a brandy-and-soda to finish up with \u2014 such was the usual programme. Sir Henry and Aura often came ; it was hardly more than a mile across the fields, and lately Muirsom had generally walked"], [54, "A SUNDAY AFTERNOON. 42 back with them to that most delightful of meals, a Sunday evening supper. \" As far as I can see, Muirsom, the race lies between your black mare and Stanhope's grey*. Are you going to ride her yourself ? \" \" No ; I can't get down to the weight, so I have enlisted Chippy as my jockey; it is to be his maiden appearance in silk.\" \" What ! Chippy, you're beginning early.\" \" Yes, aud hadn't I a bother with old Stick-in the-mud about it.\" Such was the respectful way in which Chippy designated his reverend tutor. \" I underwent a long lecture about the follies of the turf, and my future success in life ; besides, he said it did not redound to his credit for his pupils to attend and take part in races. I expect the old boy had been welched in his younger days. How ever, I made use of your name, uncle, and told him you approved strongly of my riding.\" \"And I never heard of it till this moment. You will get on at the bar, Chippy; there is no doubt about that.\" \" I think I could give Auauias two stone and a *rood beating.\" _ _"], [55, "A SUNDAY AFTERNOON. 43 \" Tho question is whether you can beat Stan hope.\" \"That depends on what sort of a temper the grey is in on the day,\" replied the Captain. \" I think he can win if he chooses, but it is even money he is left kicking at the post, or bolts out of the course. I can't say I particularly fancy my mount, but he is the best one in the stable.\" \" Would you like to come round before tea and have a look at the black ? \" asked Muirsom ; and the whole party moved off towards the stables. Aura had been very cool in her manner towards Captain Stanhope since the night of the dinner party. She believed he was amusing himself with an empty flirtation to while away the time, and was angry with him accordingly ; which proves that she really liked him, else she would not have taken the trouble to be angry. As for him, he had racked his brains fruitlessly to account for the change in her behaviour. As luck would have it, he found himself alone with her, some few yards behind the others. \" I am afraid after these races I shall have to go back to London to rejoin my regiment.\""], [56, "A SUNDAY AFTERNOON. 44 \" Indeed ! How fortunate\" for you to be in London during the season ! \" \"Unfortunate, I call it. You don't know how awfully sorry I am to leave here.\" \" I suppose we are all sorry the hunting has come to an end.\" \" Oh, I don't mean that. I mean how sorry I am to leave the people, and all that, don't you know ? \" \"Really, Captain Stanhope, you might be going to the end of the world, from the way y*ou talk. You will come down and stay with your brother again some time, I suppose ? \" \"I suppose so. But people and things change so. You may be married by that time.\" \" So may you, as far as that goes. But why this low, sentimental tone ? \" \" Me ? Nobody marries a beggarly younger son,\" he said, disregarding her last question. Aura looked up suddenly. Perhaps after all she had wronged him. \" AVhat nonsense ! \" she answered. \" AVomen are not all such miserly creatures.\" \" Do you think so ? \""], [57, "A SUNDAY AFTERNOON. 45 Their eyes met. They were in a little shrubbery walk between high laurels. \" Aura, my darling, you know I love you ! \" His arm was half round her waist. \"Aura! Aura!\" She gave him one glance \u2014 a glance full of love \u2014 as they went to her father, who was calling her. AVilson Stanhope had no opportunity of speaking to her again till the Tuesday, the day of the races. He called at Belgart Towers the next day, but both she and her father were out. Still he was happy; she had not spoken, but she had looked her love. Yet the scene in the shrubbery hardly constituted a proposal and an acceptance. Chippy's mount was being criticised, and under went the ordeal with advantage and honour to her self. She was perfect at her fences, and her staying powers were satisfactory. But she did not possess the speed of the grey. Such was the verdict of the company. But then there was the temper of tho grey. \" You stand a bigger chance of getting a purler than of winning, I am afraid, Wilson,\" his brother"], [58, "A SUNDAY AFTERNOON. 46 said to him, after a careful survey of the black mare. \" AVeU, if I do, I don't suppose that it will kill me,\" laughed the other. \" You may be sure of one thing : the grey will win unless he tumbles.\" \" The event will show, I suppose.\" Bertie Muirsom did not accept Sir Henry's invi tation to come back to supper that evening. He had partially guessed what had taken place between Aura and Stanhope in the walk from the house to the stables, though he did not imagine that things had gone as far as they had, and he wisely came to the conclusion that his presence at supper would not tend to improve his chance. He had made up his mind to marry Aura Belgart, and he was a determined man, who generally managed in the long run to gaiu what he desired. Like most people who are confident of their own powers, he was too apt to underrate the difficulties which might happen to come in his path. His present difficulty was AVilson Stanhope, whom he hardly considered worthy of the name of a rival. Cer tainly he thought he was sincere in his admiration, and was not merely carrying on a strong flirtation ;"], [59, "A SUNDAY AFTERNOON. 47 but that, in his opinion, only made matters easier, for it would be preposterous that Stanhope should think of becoming Aura's husband. Muirsom, at all events, knew the financial position of Sir Henry Belgart. He had made it his business to find it out ; and he was convinced Sir Henry would never accept a penniless captain for his son-in-law. \" I have only to sit tight, and I must win the game,\" he said to himself. And perhaps he was right."], [60, "CHAPTER V. HAYSEY STEEFLECHASES. Tuesday, the day of the races, had come. The little agricultural town of Haysey seemed as if it had suddenly woke up out of its usual somnolent condition, though only to go to sleep on the next day for another twelve months, till the Haysey races, the great event of the year, again came round. However, to-day at all events, there was life in the place. Everybody seemed busy. The hotel yard, which in days of yore had sheltered the mail coach, and the various town yards were crowded with vehicles of every sort, kind, and description, while their respective bars were crowded with all sorts of customers. The honest burly farmer, who had come for pleasure, and the slim Jewish-looking man, who had come for business, were both taking their morning drink before going on to the course. The little market-place was full of an heterogeneous multitude of ragged-looking men, shouting \" c'rect 4S"], [61, "HAYSEY STEEPLECHASES. 49 card,\" men with black faces and striped trousers ; men who for the consideration of one shilling will guarantee to tell you the names of five winners out of six by an infallible method of their own inven tion ; men who are ready for anything, from pitch and-toss to manslaughter. AVhere does this motley crowd of hangers-on of the turf come from ? How do they make their livelihood? They are thc successors of the habitues of the silver hells, which we have destroyed, they are the outcome of jail deliveries, and they live on the folly of their fellow creatm*es, who are perfectly willing to believe them when they profess to give three half-crowns for one, or to bet five-pound notes with them, although they look as if they had hardly a shilling to bless them selves with in the world. If you wish to study humanity, go to a race< meeting. So far as rascality was concerned, Haysey cer tainly presented a pleasing contrast to some of those suburban meetings, which apparently only exist for the benefit of swindlers. Although small, it was eminently sportsmanlike. Those agricultural people have not come to win money, they have come E"], [62, "HAYSEY STEEPLECHASES. 50 to see their favourite animal the horse, and to criti cise the manner in which he is ridden. They are not often far out in their judgment either, much less seldom than those members of the press who call themselves sporting journalists, many of whom would find great difficulty in sitting a horse over a sheep-hurdle, let alone over a steeplechase course. The first race was over, and luncheon had been discussed, at which meal Chippy had been limited to one glass of champagne, with a proviso that he might make up for lost time after his work was finished. The bell had rung, and all eyes were turned towards the competing horses, as they took their preliminary canter down to the starting-post. The South Grass-shire Hunt Cup always commanded a fair field of starters, though three miles of stiff country, with obstacles that required negotiating, and could not be rushed through like furze on the top of a swinging bar, prevented a fair percentage of those who were present when the flag dropped from jumping tho course. Muirsom's black mare had been made first favourite. She certainly looked as handsome as a picture, as Chippy, with"], [63, "HAYSEY STEEPLECHASES. 51 his stirrups perhaps one hole shorter than was in accordance with a perfect racing seat, cantered her past the grand stand. A little thoroughbred chestnut ridden by his owner, a well-known farmer in South Grass- shire, who had won more than one race at Haysey, found a good many supporters. '\"' He looks a more dangerous rival than the grey, Muirsom,\" said Sir Henry. The last-named animal was making his way to the post by a series of side movements, which cer tainly were averse to fast progress, and showed Stanhope that he would have his work cut out if he meant to win. Two false starts, owing to the fractiousness of the grey, and there was a cry of \" They're off\" ; the line of horses, fourteen in all, was seen as they crossed the first field, and went over the fence at the end, led by an outsider, who seemed as if he were doing his best to bolt. Over this field and a stiffish post and rails into the plough, Chippy waiting last according to his instructions. The plough steadies them down to their work, but the outsider who was still leading, rushes at the blackthorn at the end, and comes down all in a heap on to his head; two"], [64, "HAYSEY STEEPLECHASES. 52 other horses cannoning in a vain attempt to prevent jumping on the top of him, and three out of the fourteen starters are already out of it. The open ditch disposed of a fourth, who galloped straight into it, and broke his leg, having to be shot on the spot ; and now the remaining ten can be seen galloping hard down the next field towards the brook : no artificial water jump this, but a deep natural one, which if you are un fortunate enough to get into, you may give up all chance of the race, for it will take you some time to get out. Stanhope now sends the grey to the front, who is first over the water with a good two feet to spare, but is pulled up almost immediately afterwards. Splash ! splash ! an attempt to refuse, followed by an awkward cannon in mid-air, and a cold bath for two more unlucky animals with their jockeys. The black mare and the farmer's chest nut take it together. A stiff rail with some furze on the top and a nasty drop on the other side, and they enter the straight and pass the grand stand for the first time round. \" The chestnut looks most like winning now ; what's his name ? Oh ! Buccaneer. Muirsom, if"], [65, "HAYSEY STEEPLECHASES. 53 your mare is to do justice to her name of Flyaway, she will have to race all she knows.\" \" If Chippy keeps to his instructions, I think sho will win even now.\" \" Evens, Buccaneer ! Two to one against Fly away ! \" \" What a noise all those men make ! \" said Aura, with her glasses up to her eyes, as she intently followed the horses over every field. She had only seen AVilson Stanhope for a minute since the Sun day afternoon, and that was only when he came up to say good-morning before a crowd of people. There was nobody on the course, not even except ing his rider, who took a keener interest iu tho temper of the grey horse than Aura Belgart. The brook is negotiated the second time round, where it is hardly more than two yards in width, with a fence on the taking-off side, and they approach the rail with the furze, and the nasty drop. There are only three left in it \u2014 Buccaneer, Fly away, and the grey. The latter is ten lengths ahead ; while five lengths separate Flyaway from Buccaneer, Chippy still keeping behind. Of the"], [66, "nAYSEY STEEPLECHASES. 54 other five, two may get a good view of the finish, but that is all. \" The grey is bolting \u2022 he has worn out Stanhope at last. He would never be so mad as to ride at the drop at that pace,\" shouted Sir Henry. Aura turned pale, as she looked towards tho horses. There was no doubt about it : the grey had bolted. On ho came, his rider sitting well back, deter mined to do his best to keep him on his legs, thou\u201eh he could no lono-er hold him. Let him only rise and they will yet win Avith ease. But ho has got his head iu the air, and rushes madly at it. Rap ! One could hear it in the stand \u2022 but the rail is stout, aud the grey turns a half-somer sault, luckily shooting his rider clear. Buccaneer is in the straight first, with the black mare, Flyaway, three lengths behind. Both the farmer and Chippy sit down, and the whips begin to move. Buccaneer wins ! Only a hundred yai'ds more. Flyaway is on his girths, now she is on his shoulder ! they are neck and neck ! '\u2022' Scott, the young 'un 'ill lift her in now,\" shouts a lusty farmer."], [67, "HAYSEY STEEPLECHASES. 55 Buccaneer wins ! Flyaway wins ! Flyaway ! Fly away ! One last effort with whip, spurs, and hands all together, and the race is over. For a moment no one can tell who has won ; it was impossible to separate them unless one was close to the judge's box. There is a rush to find out the verdict. Flyaway. Buccaneer. Lady Winnie. Won by a short head. Bad third. So Chippy Lionel Avon his first steeplechase. Meanwhile a small crowd had collected round Stanhope. His brother had hurried down directly he saw the fall, and with the assistance of some few others moved him to a place a little distance off the course, where the doctor was already examining him. Muirsom had heard Aura's short cry and seen her face turn pale directly the casualty occurred. \" I will go down and see if Stanhope is seriously hurt. He fell clear, so I don't expect there is much harm done.\" Aura Belgart probably liked Muirsom better at that moment than she had ever done before. \" Collar bone broken and shoulder dislocated,\""], [68, "56 HAYSEY STEEPLECHASES. he said on his return. \" He will be all right again in a week or two. Lucky for him it happened at the end of the season and not at the beginning. Halloa, Chippy ! here you are. You rode admirably, old chap. Come, have some lunch now, since you denied yourself before. How do you feel ? \" \"Awfully fagged out. I never dreamt the exer tion would be so great ; hunting is nothing to it.\" \"No, you're quite right; the pace is so much faster, and you have to be riding the whole time.\" \" Still I think Stanhope would have won if it had not been for that fall.\" \" Yes \u2022 that fall did him harm,\" replied As uirsom musingly, \"in more ways than one,\" he muttered to himself. But then Muirsom did not know all that happened in the shrubbery."], [69, "57 CHAPTER VI. NIPPED in the bud. As Muirsom had predicted, in three weeks Captain Stanhope was sufficiently convalescent to be able to rejoin his regiment. To Aura those three weeks had been weeks of doubtful anxiety. What had passed between her and Stanhope could hardly be said to constitute an engagement, so as to allow of her speaking to Sir Henry on the subject. If they had had five more minutes without interruption on that eventful Sunday afternoon, matters would have been brought to a crisis one way or the other* but, as it was, although the usual messages of inquiry had been sent from the Towers, they had had no private communication with one another. The shoulder prevented the captain from using a pen, while feminine pride forbade Aura to write to him.

From the absent way iu which Aura sipped her tea"], [70, "NIPPED IN THE BUD. 58 without touching her food, it was evident that her correspondence was of a more than usually inter esting character. At last, Avhen Sir Henry was about to leave the room, she said, \u2014 \" Oh ! by the bye, papa, there is a note from Captain Stanhope to say he is coming over to lunch, to wish us good-bye before he rejoins his regiment.\" \" Very kind of him, I am sure,\" answered the baronet in a slightly sarcastic manner. As a matter of fact the note contained much more j it contained ardent protests of undying love \u2014 the usual phrases which men worry their brains to invent when they are writing to the girl they intend to marry. It is certainly foolish waste of time for them to take so much trouble, for there are plenty of sensational novels with letters ready written and correctly spelt which they need only copy.

As nobody ever does their duty, we might consign the word itself to oblivion. Wilson Stanhope drove over in a dog-cart, or rather was driven over by one of his brother's grooms, for he was still unable to use his arm. The groom drove fast, so he said, with the result that he found Aura in the park ; for that young lady generally professed to take a constitutional before lunch. The meetings and conversations of lovers are extremely wearisome to anybody but the lovers themselves, except perhaps to those who wish to gain experience how to act under similar circum stances; therefore let us leave Captain Stanhope and Aura to the privacy Avhich they enjoyed. If any of my readers be amongst the inexperienced, I can only say that I have been credibly informed \u2014 but my credible information has nothing to do with this story. The sequel of the morning was that, luncheon"], [72, "NIPPED IN THE BUD. 60 being over, Captain Stanhope asked Sir Henry if he could spare him a few minutes in the study. Probably the most difficult conversation for a man to go through in this life is when he has to ask the consent of his would-be father-in-law to his mar- riage with his daughter. The difficulty is more than doubled if the man happens to be poor, and will have to subsist on the bounty of his future relative. The wisest course to pursue undoubtedly is to marry first and to ask the consent afterwards, a course which Stanhope would not have been ad verse to if he could only have persuaded Aura to fall in Avith his views. Directly the request was asked, Sir Henry guessed the nature of what would follow, and immediately determined what his answer should be. There was no beating about the bush ; Stanhope soon came to the point. He told Sir Henry briefly that he loved Aura, that he firmly believed Aura loved him, and that, in short, he Avished to know if there were any objections to their marriage. \" But how do you mean to live ? Your pay and your private income, even if they provided you with the necessaries of life, will hardly supply you"], [73, "NIPPED IN THE BUD. 61 with those luxuries which both you and my daughter are at present accustomed to enjoy.\" \" Of course we shouldn't expect to live at first in the same fashion as we do now; still \" And Stanhope hesitated for a moment, for he did not like to suggest that Sir Henry was rich, and Aura was his only child. \" Still I might help you. Captain Stanhope, it would be foolish on my part to keep you in sus pense ; but this match is impossible. I need not trouble you with my affairs, except that, however much I might wish, it, it is altogether beyond my power to make any settlement on my daughter. If you marry, it means poverty for both of you ; so that once for all I must decline to give my consent, and shall persuade my daughter that I am right in doing so. I feel sure that as a gentleman and an officer you will not do anything after this to cause her to disobey my wishes.\" \" And why not, Sir Henry ? I love Aura too well to give her up, merely because you say you will not make any settlement. If I am a younger son, I am not a fortune-hunter, as you appear to think. For my own part I can dispense with your"], [74, "62 NIPPED IN THE BUD. consent, and I give you fair notice I shall do my best to persuade your daughter to dispense with it as well.\" \" All right, Captain Stanhope ; since you are unable to do credit to my motives, I think we had better say good-morning,\" and Sir Henry rang the bell. \" Captain Stanhope's carriage,\" he said, when the footman appeared. \"Am I not even to be allowed to say good-bye to Miss Belgart?\" \" I do not consider it desirable.\" He only caught a glimpse of her at the window, as he drove past; that was the only farewell he had. \" Selfish old brute ! \" he muttered angrily to him self. When he got home he sat down and wrote a long letter to Aura : it was a foolish epistle, \u2014 he asked her to elope Avith him; he wanted her love, and not her money, and so on for three sheets. Meanwhile Aura in her turn Avas undergoing the painful ordeal of an interview in the study. I have before said that his daughter was probably the only creature on earth that Sir Henry had the"], [75, "NIPPED IN THE BUD. 63 least affection for ; but for her at all events his love was strong. It was for her sake much more than his own, that he had so summarily dismissed Wilson Stanhope. His voice was kind when she came into the study. \"Don't cry, Aura, my darling. I know exactly how it all is ; but you will try and bear up for my sake, won't you ? \" \" For your sake, papa ? \" \" Yes, dear, for mine as well as yours ; for it is impossible for you ever to marry Stanhope ; so it is better to face the difficulty at once, and get over it.\" \" But, papa, why impossible ? I know he is poor, but what of that ? I am sure you think him none the worse for his poverty.\" \" Not at all, dear. I am not given to putting much value on money, as you know ; but there are other reasons. Some day I will tell you ; but you will obey my wishes for the present ? \" \" Tell me now ; I am not a school-girl.\" And she Avent up caressingly to her father, for it was evident that he was very troubled. \" Papa, tell me !

Had he not been father, mother, brother, and companion to her ? Her playfellow as a little girl, and the staunchest of friends to her as a Avoman ? \"Tell me, what is it?\" she asked again. \"I can bear anything, even ruin ; or worse still, dis grace. We will fight against it together. But tell me, what is it ? \" There are moments Avhen the most hardened men of the world break down beneath the keenness of their feelings; when the flood of past recollections comes pouring in upon the mind with its deluge of lost opportunities; when human passions become strung to such a pitch of excitement, that the whole ner vous system collapses, and the thoughts which have been pent up for years culminate in a torrent Avhich bursts upon the heart, till it seems fit to break."], [77, "NIPPED IN THE BUD. 65 In the same way as there are times when the sea Avail yields to the strength of the ocean, and the Avaves Avith irresistible force sweep over the land Avhich has been reclaimed, or Avhen the inert volcano showers forth its avalanche, carrying de struction all around, so do the various affections to which man has been subjected by nature overpoAver the restraints of modern artificiality, and in their unaccustomed liberty shake the human frame in which they have been so long confined. So it Avas with Sir Henry Belgart. For months he had been brooding over his misfortunes \u2014 mis fortunes caused by the folly of his early life. How bitterly, and how often in the solitude of his study, after the rest of his household were fast asleep, had he cursed his extravagance ! Yet he had never had the moral courage to retrench. Now as his daughter hung round his neck, re calling to him the image of her mother, and re minding him of the strongest love it is possible for a man to have, he felt that she was all he had left to him in this life, and he must tell her that her happiness was ruined. He was a strong man, not yet past the meridian F"], [78, "NIPPED IN THE BUD. 66 of manhood; and for the first time since, twenty years ago, he stood by the family vault one winter morning, his breast Avas shaken Avith sobs and the tears rolled down his cheeks. Let us draw the veil ! To Englishmen, family affections aud family griefs are sacred. When Aura Belgart left the study she knew everything. Wilson Stanhope had received Aura's answer to the extravagant letter he had written to her on his return from Belgart Towers. That he considered it unsatisfactory might be judged from his moody look, as he strode up and down the lawn in front of his brother's house, smoking his morning pipe. There Avas no room for doubt ; he had been jilted, that Avas the plain truth. One moment he abused Aura : \" Frailty, thy name is woman,\" he repeated to himself ; and swore he would never forgive her. Then he excused her, and determined it was all the fault of her father, with his selfish love of money. \" It is over now : the sooner you forget her tho better,\" said common sense. \" You can't forget,\" said love. \" Be revenged,\" said masculine pride."], [79, "NIPPED IN THE BUD. 67 \" There is somebody else,\" said jealousy.

He had threatened Sir Henry that he would persuade his daughter to dispense with his consent; but he was obliged to own to himself that he Avas absolutely powerless to carry out the threat. He had to return to London, Avhere his regiment was stationed : letters would be worse thau useless, so what could he do ? His passion for the present was nipped in the bud : Avould it ever revive and flourish ?"], [80, "68 CHAPTER VII. SUEE TO AVIN. Easter had come and gone, and spring was chang ing into summer. Chippy had migrated to the heated atmosphere of London, under the pretext of reading for the bar, which meant getting as much fun out of life as an allowance of five hundred a year would permit of his doing ; and the fair de moiselles of Haysey were left to fiud consolation in succeeding pupils, and eventually to marry bag men or grocers' assistants. Meanwhile, an intimacy approaching to a firm friendship had sprung up between Sir Henry Bel gart and Bertie Muirsom. With the exception of Mr. Timothy Pipkin, the walking prodigy of thc South Grass-shire Hunt, Bertie Muirsom was the only person Avithin easy walking distance of the Towers with whom Sir Henry could form any sort of companionship. He had come down into South"], [81, "SURE TO WIN. 69 Grass-shire about five years ago, ostensibly for the hunting, and generally used to spend the season in London. Although he brought no introductions with him, his genial manners and bold riding soon won him acquaintances ; and at the end of his first hunting season, Muirsom was a firmly established member of the county society. This year, however, the end of May had arrived, and Muirsom was still residing in the country. He ran up to town for a night or two occasionally, to see his tailor or get his hair cut, but he seemed to have no idea of going up to stay permanently. He was far too judicious to press his suit with Aura ; he knew that she must have time if she were to forget Stanhope, and he determined not to ruin his schemes by haste. It was Sunday afternoon, and Muirsom had been lunching* at the Towers; no uncommon thing, for it was extraordinary how he had got into the habit of spending his Sundays there. Aura was amusing herself with a book as she lay in a garden chair, under one of the old elms, while her father and Muirsom walked up and down the lawn smoking their cigars."], [82, "SURE TO WIN. 70 \" Muirsom, did you ever have any dealings with lawyers and money-lenders ? \" asked Sir Henry. \"Not on my own account,\" the other replied. \"I was born under a lucky star, coming into a fortune, sufficient to amply supply all my needs, when I was twenty-one.\" \" But on anybody else's account ? \" \" I once helped a friend to negotiate the sale of a mortgage ; but that is all the experience I have ever had.\" \"Well, that is much the same thing as I wanted to ask your advice about.

I forgot to tell you. He has become quite the London masher.\" \" More the London masher than the lawyer, I expect,\" said Sir Henry. \" I don't suppose he will ever practise, for he is heir to a large estate.\" \" Yet he has two sisters, much older ? \" \" Yes. It is rather a curious family history, is that of the Lionels ; or rather, there is a tragedy connected with it. There was an eldest son, Walter, who was always rather inclined to go the pace. When he left school, they did the most foolish thing Avith him they could possibly do; namely, they let him go by himself on a voyage round the world. To cut a long story short, he got into a scrape at San Francisco with some gambler or other, whose wife he had been making love to. The gambler objected, and consequently shot him.

But how did they get the news ? \" \" The wife of the gambler, who signed herself ' Jessie Massinger,' wrote and told them the account, and, moreover, caused the body to be sent home.\" \" Massinger ! Massinger ! \" repeated Muirsom to himself. \" I have heard that name before. Ah ! I recollect now. It was when I was travelling in America, I once met a certain Hugh Massinger, somewhere in California, and he was pointed out to me as one of the most successful gamblers out there. It would probably be the same man, but he had no wife with him.\" \" Very possibly. The world is very small. Aura, I think we might have our tea on the lawn this afternoon, it is such a lovely day.\" \" Very well, Papa.\" There is something peculiarly piquant in a woman pouring out tea. Then, at all events, she rules, and men have to become her slaA'es, and do her bidding in the shape of drowning the tea with hot water, and handing her bread-and-butter or bonbons. They enjoy the submission, and hence the popularity of the institution.

He certainly did not resemble those productions of South Kensington, who are a sort of cross between a tailor's dummy and a harmless inhabitant of Hanwell, the Dun drearies of the present day. He was eA*ery inch a man ; yet there could be no doubt that he had developed a great taste for afternoon tea, with the proviso that it was poured out by Aura Belgart. He was no bad judge, either. Aura was a fair example of a pretty English girl, such as no other country iu Europe can produce. The habits and manners of London society, with the false artifici- ality and loose ideas of morality which they en- gender, are doing their best to render the species obsolete. But as yet there are many girls like Aura Belgart ; girls bred in the country, who are sportswomen, braced up by constant healthy ex- ercise, with sufficient experience of the world to prevent their lapsing into that intolerable thing which Byron describes as a bread-and-butter miss, with fresh complexions and well-developed limbs, and with minds so pure that it were sacrilege by even a word, a look, or a suggestion, to rob them"], [86, "74 SURE TO WIN. of a particle of their purity.

To the first class of women did Aura Belgart belong. The critical reader will say that it was to her Chippy confided those boyhood flirtations in which he used to indulge. To a guilty mind they may be contaminating, but to an innocent mind they are only humorous. It was no surprising event, therefore, that she should already have won the love of two men. She knew perfectly well that Muirsom loved her; she knew that he was to a certain extent aware that there had been a mutual liking, if not love, between herself and Stanhope, and she respected him for his delay in urging his own suit. She liked him very much, partly for his own sake, and partly because he was such a friend of her father's."], [87, "SURE TO WIN. 75 \" I am sure to win,\" Muirsom said to himself, as he smoked his last solitary pipe that night. Dinner was over, and Sir Henry Belgart and his host sat over their claret discussing the best way for the former to meet his difficulties. They were more involved than Muirsom had thought. Fifty thousand pounds, and considerable retrenchment, would be needed to place matters on a satisfactory basis. Muirsom turned the situation over in his own mind. He could afford to lend the sum ; he would have, in any case, Belgart Towers as a security ; and it might serve to promote his matri monial projects in regard to Aura. Still, he knew that the sense of obligation often has the effect of destroying friendship; how*ever, he must guard against that danger. Yes, he would do it. So the result was that an appointment was made between Sir Henry Belgart's solicitor and Muir som's solicitor, and for the present the Baronet was relieved from his anxieties. Of course he told Aura of the liberality of Muirsom, and she had no diffi culty in guessing the true cause of that liberality. His ideas of the proper conduct of a gentleman were, she knew, too lofty for him to unduly use his"], [88, "76 SURE TO WIN. pecuniary advantage ; but she also knew that before long she would have to decide whether or not she would become his wife."], [89, "77 CHAPTER VIII.

Muirsom still remained in Grass-shire, having (much to the surprise of his friends) refused two or three yachting invitations; and Chippy, who after his exertions in town needed the holiday of the long vacation, had come down to stay with him fur a few days. Three months in London had done much to alter the character of the boy. He had gained experi ence in many things ; in some of which, perhaps, it might have been just as well for him if he had re mained in his former state of blissful ignorance. Not that he had yielded to the snares of dissipation. If he had wasted a fair slice of his income on \" the frail doves, who flutter about the sacred groves of the Evangelist,\" he had not sunk into debauchery."], [90, "MR. TIMOTHY PIPKIN'S PICNIC. 78 Still there could be no doubt that a short visit to the country would have a most beneficial effect both on his moral and physical health. He had not stayed with Muirsom long, before he clearly perceived how the land lay between him and Aura j that is to say, so far as the former was con cerned, for he could not form an idea in regard to the state of his cousin's feelings. She did not ap pear to give Muirsom the slightest encouragement, nor ou the other hand did she show him the cold shoulder, as a woman invariably does to the man who admires her, but whose feelings she does not reciprocate. He had not, however, long to wait before doubt became certainty. Mr. Timothy Pipkin, the walk ing prodigy of the South Grass-shire Hunt, had re solved to give a picnic. It may be said that it had taken Mr. Pipkin several days to make up his mind on tho point of this said picuic; but whether from the fact that that mind of his was, like Mark Twain's, so large that a loug time must necessarily elapse before it could be made up, or that its dimen sions were so small that a powerful microscope would have to be brought into requisition in order that it"], [91, "MR. TIMOTHY PIPKIN'S PICNIC. 79 might be discovered, was a question to which Mr. Pipkin's circle of friends and acquaintances could never give a unanimous answer. The truth Avas, that he was rather a bashful man at all times, but more especially so when in the presence of the softer sex, and the idea of attempting to play the host to something like a score of females was sufficiently appalling to make him go through all the various stas-es of indecision before he had sent the much-thought-of invitations to the post ; and even then the little man went to bed in a state of profound astonishment and intense wonder at his own temerity. The day arrived, and, as a curious coincidence, happened to be fine. It had been arranged that everybody was to drive over to an old abbey some fifteen to twenty miles away, Avhere they were to be entertained by Mr. Pipkin at lunch. Sir Henry Belgart, Aura, Muirsom, and Chippy had driven over together ; aud, arriving rather late, found everybody making suggestions as to which Avas the most suitable place for lunch, while the servants were already busily engaged in unpacking hampers. The usual casualties Avhich always attend a"], [92, "MR. TIMOTHY PIPKIN'S PICNIC. 80 picnic, and Avithout Avhich that form of entertain ment would be intolerable, were not wanting. Thus a conventional High Church curate with the cog nomen of Dreary, who was troubled with the phy sical disadvantage of his legs being too long for his body, sat down in the middle of a lobster salad, thereby varying the sober hue of his nether garments, and, to make bad worse, in his futile endeavours to right himself, upset a glass of cham pagne into the lap of an old lady ; so that his con versation for the rest of the day was confined to a sort of perpetual apology, but whether for spoiling the salad or the dress was a matter of doubt. But the most greedy mortals cannot eat lunch all day : somebody asked for leave to smoke, aud there was a general inclination for a move. The dessert of a picnic nearly always means stroll ing off iu pairs, Avith mild flirtation as the result ; and Mr. Pipkin's guests evidently intended that to day should be no exception to the rule. The old people talk scandal, and lay claim to a taste for the picturesque by commonplace admiration of the scenery; while old trees, bracken fern, and an after noon sun are apt to make the young think that"], [93, "MR. TIMOTHY PIPKIN'S PICNIC. 81 sentiment does exist in this modern world of reality, housekeeping bills, and never-ending rates and taxes. Aura Belgart and Muirsom strolled amongst the old abbey ruins, where once generations of monks had dined and made merry. The rooms were roof less now, and the walls were covered with ivy with roots as thick as the trunks of young trees. Coarse grass and daisies grew on the floors, where devout ascetics had once knelt. Yet the ruin seemed grand in its old age, defying the onslaughts of time. Proud relic of the middle ages, when might was right, and men won the love of women by deeds of chivalry* ! Then science had not destroyed religious faith, and the fancies of superstition peopled the Avoods with elfins holding their midnight revels, or fairies gliding to their trysting place. Poetry and romance were not then mere names, for the world was younger, and men were the children of nature and not the offspring of a dull artificiality. The influence of old-world recollections made it self felt in the mind of Muirsom ; perhaps also in that of his companion. Men loved fiercely then, and did not hesitate to confess their passions ; now G"], [94, "82 MR.

We haggle over deeds of settlement, and wonder whether we shall be obliged to reduce our private expenditure.

He de termined that the time had arrived when he should tell his love, and discover Avhether there was any chance of its being returned ; for he was a man of strong passions and strong intellect, to whom delay was irksome, and he knew that it would be better fcr him to know the worst than to remain in doubt. He gazed down upon her where she sat, and she intuitively guessed his thoughts ; and her heart beat tremulously while she looked absently before her.

The birds warbled overhead, and the whole of nature was gay, and everything around seemed full of gladness, as if in welcome of the advent of lovo. The cynic may sneer, and deny that human hearts can beat with unselfish passion, and the man of the world may be unable to tear himself away from the stern reality of life, yet nature will sometimes even noAv assert her sway, and giA'e birth to the emotions of harmonious joy.

The news of Aura Belgart's engagement to Muir som soon became public property, and, so far as could be judged by gossip, met with the public approval. In fact, it appeared to be what is com monly called a suitable match. It was true, cer tainly, that when Muirsom had first come down into Grass-shire, the county people had taken him as it were on credit, without troubling themselves about his antecedents \u2014 a course of conduct which they had had no reason to regret. He was rich and a gentleman, genial in bis manner, and undeniably one of the best men across country with the South Grass-shire hounds. Now he was going to marry the daughter of one of the oldest families in the county. Nothing could be better. Society had not been rash in its judgment. Nobody ventured to doubt that Sir Henry did not know who he was and Avhence he came."], [97, "THE LOVE OF WOMEN. 85 There Avas one person, howeA*er, who, to judge by his manner when he first heard of the engagement, seemed indisposed to give it his approval. That person was Captain Stanhope. Regimental duties obliged him to remain in town during August, which, to say the least, was inconvenient; so that when one morning he received a letter from his sister-in-law, telling him that his \"old flame, Miss Belgart,\" was going to marry Bertie Muirsom, the Captain's state of mind was the decided reverse of pleasant. His first feeling was one of incredulous astonishment ; but when he had read all the current gossip in regard to the engagement, which his sister had thought fit to retail to him, he got up from his hardly tasted breakfast, and, lighting a pipe, determined to think the matter well over. To do Stanhope justice, he was not one of those men, so common in the army, who, because they are entitled to wear a showy uniform, think them selves irresistible in the eyes of the fairer sex. Vanity was not one of his characteristics. But he was unable to conceive how a girl like Aura Bel gart could confess that she loved him in the spring, and before the autumn become engaged to another"], [98, "THE LOVE OF WOMEN. 86 man. She was no bread-and-butter miss fresh from the schoolroom, and unable to know her own mind ; nor, on the contrary, was she a heart- less woman of the world, scheming to make the best marriage Avhich lay in her power. He had always thought her the most perfect type of a thoroughbred English girl, a combination of beauty, purity, and truth ; and so he thought her still, even in the first moments of his disappointment. Yet how could she, within a few months, forget him, and give to another the love which had once been his ! That was the question, and Wilson Stanhope was not the first man who has discovered that the love of woman is a problem difficult to solve. He had loved her deeply, more deeply than any body knowing his character would have thought ; and till this morning he had dreamt that she loved him. No wonder that the sudden disenchantment Avas painful. Although love with him did not mean, as it is supposed to mean in the case of women, the whole of existence, he had taken Aura Belgart as his standard of Avomanhood, and it Avas hard to find that standard so low. Till he had heard of her engagement, he had not given up all"], [99, "THE LOVE OF WOMEN. 87 hope of making her his wife ; now it was an impos sibility. With such an experience the majority of men Avould have become confirmed women-haters, cynical misogynists ; but Stanhope was not the man to jump at a hasty conclusion. The more he thought over the unwelcome news, the more he was convinced that there must be something in the background, of which he Avas in ignorance. He knew that Sir Henry Belgart had forbidden his suit simply on account of money, and Aura had yielded passive obedience to her father's wishes. But why did she yield such passive obedience ? For she Avas a girl Avith spirit ; while, although not rich, he Avas still far from penniless. He had from eight hundred to a thousand a year, besides his pay, and Sir Henry had the reputation of being rich. As Stanhope pondered over these things, it suddenly struck him that he had heard Sir Henry had lost money on the turf in his younger days. If that Avere true, of course his property might be heavily mortgaged, and he himself, although living at Belgart Towers, be in reality extremely poor. He knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and resolved to find out the extent of the Baronet's early losses."], [100, "THE LOVE OF WOMEN. 88 With his number of racing acquaintances it would not be very difficult. He filled another pipe and pursued his present train of thought. In the foreground was a selfish father, heavily encumbered with debts, a beautiful daughter, and a rich suitor ; in the background a pauper captain in the character of lover. The old, old story which has served plots for hundreds of novels. But then in the novels all ends happily, and, to use a hackneyed phrase, love is triumphant. In real life the girl marries the rich man, and either settles down to a comfortable existence or figures in the Divorce Court. Meanwhile the father, in stead of being called selfish, is praised as a man careful for the welfare of his daughter; for modern society, being nothing more nor less than a matri monial market in which parents are the auctioneers and fools the bidders, is bound to applaud the many sacrifices at the altar of Mammon Avhich it causes. So we all dance round in the whirligig of hypocrisy*. Chivalry is gone, and lovo becomes degraded into sensuality. Marriage is perverted into an outrage upon Nature \u2014 an outrage not to be committed with impunity; and men aud women are wrecked on a"], [101, "THE LOVE OF WOMEN. 89 strand of lifelong misery, and lead an existence of silent anguish. As these thoughts hustled one another together in Stanhope's brain, he determined that at all events he would do his utmost to prevent this marriage of Aura's. Who was Muirsom ? To him ho was a mystery, which it must be his first effort to clear away. He began to look upon himself in the light of a detective, not an enviable character to a man who has been brought up to detest any thing approaching to underhand conduct. But if ever the end can justify the means, in the eyes of an honourable man, it is Avhen the heart is con cerned. Nevertheless, Stanhope felt a guilty twinge of conscience as he strolled towards his club, intent on gaining any information which might be useful to his present purpose. It is a source of great wonder that the students of mental physiology \u2014 that science which has christened itself by a high-sounding name and attained A'ery little in the shape of results \u2014 have not devoted themselves . more carefully to the analysis of love. As it is, novelists have been obliged to draw upon their imaginations in a way"], [102, "90 THE LOVE OF WOMEN. Avhich speaks more for their ingenuity than their truth. In attempting to solve the problem of Aura's conduct, Stanhope had omitted two im portant factors. He had forgotten that when a womau has once known what love means, she is naturally more prepared to indulge in that passion, than a girl to whom, the so-called affairs of the heart are an enigma. Few widows are averse to a second marriage, unfortunately for the happiness of the sterner sex. Thus when Aura Belgart recognised that her engagement to Stanhope was an impossi bility, and that Muirsom, whom she had no reason to dislike, was in love with her, she was not so dis inclined to transfer her affection as her former lover had imagined. She had always liked Muir som, and he was a man to be proud of, for other men admired him : two facts which go far towards promoting a more tender feeling. Then, again, Aura was grateful to him for helping her father out of his difficulties. A girl canuot love two meu; and, if Aura now could have chosen of her own free will whom she Avould marry, she Avould not improbably have given the preference to Muirsom. This was the first factor that the Captaiu had"], [103, "THE LOVE OF WOMEN. 91 omitted. The second was perhaps of still more importance. He had not estimated at its proper value the love of an only child for her only parent. He had assumed that Aura's love for him ought to be stronger than her love for Sir Henry. He had ignored the primary rule of logic, that where there is no similarity, there can be no comparison ; and it never occurred to him that, Avhen two feelings absolutely different in their quality happen to con flict, the result cannot be calculated beforehand. Aura Avould have considered it the height of selfish ness to ruin her father by marrying Stanhope. It Avas uot her own welfare alone that she had to think about, and nobody could blame her for the course she had taken, except a man like Stanhope, who was so infatuated as to let his passion get the better of his judgment. The Greeks with their mythological fancies made love blind. However glaring a satire this may be on the majority of young ladies and adventurous bachelors of modern time, there was no doubt that love had made Captain Stanhope as blind as it ever made any romantic Greek, since Helen fled with Paris. Love may be commonly represented as a"], [104, "92 THE LOVE OF WOMEN. beautiful cherub, but Le Sage was nearer the truth Avhen he represented it as a hideous devil on two sticks. Cupid may be more pleasant to gaze at, but Asmodeus has more power. We may dream of romance, and write odes to Aphrodite, but if we worship her she repays us, only too often with the coin of folly. Yet folly sometimes brings us happiness."], [105, "93 CHAPTER X. CHIPrY FORMS A NEW ACQUAINTANCE. While Captain Stanhope was alternately pursuing the work of an amateur detective, and cursing his fate in being obliged to remain in London, Avhile the streets were being repaved and the clubs redecorated, Chippy had betaken himself to his father's house iu the country. What there was in common between Mr. Lionel and his son, it would have been difficult for anybody* to discover, yet Chippy had remained at The Grange since his visit to Muirsom, and apparently had every intention of stopping some time longer. Mr. Lionel's life was a mystery to his neighbours. After the death of his wife and the marriage of his daughters, he had gone abroad, and after wandering about Europe for some six months had eventually rented a villa and settled down on the coast of Italy. There he remained for five years ; but of the life he led, his friends, and even his"], [106, "94 CHIPPY FORMS A NEW ACQUAINTANCE. family, could form but a very remote idea. Vague rumours there were of dark-eyed, olive-skinned, Italian beauties being seen on the terraces, who bestowed their languishing caresses on the owner, who drank his wine and ate his fruit, and were dismissed as soon as they failed to please. One fine morning, however, the housekeeper at The Grange received a letter to say her master would be home in a week, and everything Avas got iu readiness to receive him. Mr. Lionel accordingly arrived, bringing with him a large collection of books, a few choice pictures, and some pieces of statuary, which the housekeeper was heard to say she considered extremely indecent. But whether or not the reports about his dissipation were true, he brought no bewitching nymphs with him, which was a slight disappointment to the country people Avith their love of scandal. He had brought a French cook, certainly, which led his neighbours to anticipate sundry dinner parties at The Grange. In this, however, they were disappointed, for Mr. Lionel shut himself out from all social intercourse, as far as they Avere concerned. Occasionally there were gentlemen visitors, but uobody Avas asked to"], [107, "CHIPPY FORMS A NEW ACQUAINTANCE. 95 meet them. So the consequence was that he was first abused, and finally looked upon as a social recluse. In reality he was a disappointed man, with sufficient wisdom to prevent his disappointments making him unhappy. During his wife's lifetime he had sat in the House of Commons, where he had displayed sufficient ability to make men think he would one day become a prominent statesman. But when she died, all ambition to succeed in the world had left him. His only object was to be happy ; and when the summer of his life was past, he returned home from the Continent, and buried himself amongst his books and works of art, a strict disciple of Epicurus, holding that peace and calm constitute the supreme happiness of man. After the bustle and gaiety of town, Chippy had found the hot days pass very pleasantly amongst the lawns and groves round The Grange. Mr. Lionel might be a hermit, but he considered the most refined luxury essential to his hermitage. If he passed his days basking in the sun, reading Horace or Petrarch, his dinner was fit for a prince, and his cellar was full of the choicest wines. So"], [108, "CHIPPY FORMS A NEW ACQUAINTANCE. 96 lone as he did not interfere with his father's tastes, O Chippy was free to do as he pleased. Sometimes he would join Mr. Lionel, and they would spend the day reading aloud Byron or Shelley. Wine, fruit, and delicately scented cigarettes would be by their side, and father and son would revel in the lazy enjoyment of the dolce far niente. At other times he would drive over to luncheon at one of the many country houses to which he had the entree, and remain the whole afternoon playing lawn-tennis. Perfectly untrammelled, he had nothing to do but consult his own pleasure. From one of those unaccountable impulses Avhich often have such an effect upon our lives, Chippy one afternoon strolled into the little village church yard, to visit his brother's grave. In this age of artificial civilization, romance is rare; and the death of his elder brother, and the subsequent curious manner in Avhich the body had been sent home by the woman calling herself Mrs. Massinger, had always struck Chippy as peculiarly strange. Per haps, too, the event served in a small way as a warning to him not to plunge Avildly in dissipation. It's an ill wind that blows nobody any good; may-"], [109, "CHIPPY FORMS A NEW ACQUAINTANCE. 97 be, Walter Lionel did more good by his death than he ever did in his life. Now he lies in the calm churchyard, dead to this world of joy and revelry, of black care and never ceasing misery ; he died, and his brother reigns in his stead. Let his sins die with him.

Standing Avith her back towards him was a tall woman dressed in black, while on the mound of earth was placed a wreath of white flowers. His first thought was to return in silence ; but curiosity made him doubt, and before he had made up his mind, the lady turned round and caught sight of him. She might have been any age between thirty and forty-five, and must have been wonderfully beauti ful in her younger years. She was handsome now, as she stood there, with a melancholy look in her dark eyes, surprised at seeing the fair, curly-headed boy. \" Excuse me ; I am afraid I disturbed you.\" He raised his hat, and turned round to leave the church yard. ii"], [110, "98 CHIPPY FORMS A NEW ACQUAINTANCE. _r \" I have done all I came to do,\" she replied, as if to call him to her. \" You are Mr. Lionel's brother, are you not ? Or rather, I should say, Mr. Lionel ?\" Chippy bowed in acknowledgment. \" You knew my brother ? \" \"Very well. I met him in Chicago many years ago ; in fact, he stayed at my mother's house for over a week, and we all were very fond of him. Then the next thing we heard of him,\" and her voice slightly faltered, \" was his unfortunate death. You will forgive me the liberty of au old friend in placing a wreath here ? \" \" Forgive ! I thank you most sincerely.\" They walked down the path leading out of the churchyard iu silence, a silence Avhich the boy found awkward. \" You knew my name,\" he said, as he opened the gate for her ; \"excuse me if I ask whom I have had the pleasure of thanking.\" \" Certainly.\" She took out a card-case, and giving him a card, said, \" If you care to call ou me in London, I shall be very pleased to see you. I am generally at home on Sunday and Tuesday afternoons.\""], [111, "CHIPPY F0R2IS A NEW ACQUAINTANCE. 99 Chippy thanked her as he took the card, \u2014 \" Mrs. Saxondale, Hamilton Terrace, Maida Vale. I won der who on earth she eau be ? \" he thought to himself. \" Have you far to go ? \" he asked. \" I shall catch the four forty-five back to Lon don.\" Then, noticing his look of surprise, she went on : \" We Americans don't think so much of travelling as you do, you know.\" \" No, I suppose not. You will let me escort you to the station, however, Mrs. Saxondale, and see you into the train ? \" \" By all means, if you like.\" They walked across the fields together; he won dering who she could be, and thinking her more aud more handsome every time she turned her large dark eyes towards him; Avhile the object of his wonder and admiration seemed perfectly calm and collected, as if it was the most ordinary thing in the world to make a journey of a hundred miles in order to lay a wreath of white flowers on a young man's grave. \"You have been in this part of the country before ? \" ventured Chippy."], [112, "100 CHIPPY FORMS A NEW ACQUAINTANCE. \" No. Why should you think so ? \" \" I don't know, except that you knew who I was.\" \" And you are not such a well-known character anywhere else?\" she said, smiling at him. \"The sexton told me you were at home ; so Avhen I saw you, I took it for granted you were Mr. Lionel. And I guessed right, you see.\" Chippy was not sufficiently a man of the world to make conversation flow easily when he was puzzling his brains as to who his companion could be. He saw too that she could read his thoughts, which made it the more embarrassing. Neither of them had spoken a word for over a hundred yards, when she looked round, and said archly, \u2014 \" Come, Mr. Lionel, you are wondering who I am, and why I should come all these miles to visit your brother's grave, \u2014 now aren't you ? \" \" Well, really, you know, \u2014 yes, candidly, I Avas.

Your brother and I carried on what you would call a pretty strong flirtation; and when I heard of his death, I found out that I had cared for him more than I supposed.

How long are you going to remain down here ? \" \"I can't say. It depends on the weather, and heaps of things.

Don't forget.\" \" You are not going back to America yet awhile ? \" asked Chippy. \" Oh ! goodness, no. Since my husband died, I have settled altogether in London. I have had the education of my daughter to see to, which made me come to England in the first place. Now that is"], [114, "CHIPPY FORMS A NEW ACQUAINTANCE. 102 nearly finished ; yet all her friends, and most of mine, live in London, so we shall remain.\" A widoAV, with a daughter whose education is nearly finished ! If the daughter is as good-looking as the mother, the house should be well worth visit ing, thought Chippy. Besides, all American girls are supposed to have beauty and money. Certainly his companion was a lady whose acquaintance he ought to cultivate. \" By the bye, we shall be out of London till the last week in September, Mr. Lionel. But I suppose you Avill be ditto ; so there is no fear of your trudg ing up to Maida Vale to find that we are out when you get there. What a number of stiles you have in this part of the world ! \" \" There are only two more for you to surmount, and then you're close to the station, I am sorry to say, for I've enjoyed the walk immensely. I am so glad I met yon.\" \"Well, it will be your own fault, if you let the acquaintanceship end here,\" she said, as he helped her over the stile, and in doing so, caught a glimpse of a tiny shoe and a tapering ankle. \" You must look upon me as a sort of friend of the family.\""], [115, "CHIPPY FORMS A NEW ACQUAINTANCE. 103 \" Thanks, awfully. Here we are at the station, and there's your train coming in.\" He saAV her into a carriage, and they shook hands cordially. Nobody who saw her smiling good-bye would have taken them for acquaintances of only half an hour's standing. \" A deuced curious adventure,\" was Chippy's in ward remark as he strolled homewards in the late autumn afternoon. \" What a beauty she must have been ! And she fell in love with my brother, and came all the way from London to see his grave. Women are funny things.\" The funny qualities of the opposite sex afforded him sufficient grounds for conjecture till he reached The Grange ; but as the feelings of the feminine heart are not to be explained by any system of logic known to man, Chippy's conjectures were of little value. A sympathy which never jars ; a loyalty which is always true and knows no forgetfulness ; a generosity which accounts no gift too valuable but that it should be given \u2014 these are the qualities of the loving woman. But then loving Avomen are so rare."], [116, "101 CHIPPY FORMS A NEW ACQUAINTANCE. Love is au article of commerce now. The duchess, rolling along iu her carriage, calls herself virtuous, and sneers at foolish frailty. Her love was bought by a marriage settlement, a house in Park Lane, and a moor in the Highlands; but foolish frailty could only obtain a sealskin jacket, or at the best a few diamonds. Sneer on, my virtuous hypocrite! Every woman has her price; and you were fortunate enough to find a bidder sufficient fool to offer more for you thau you were worth. Fortune is blind, and we are all the slaves of fate. Life is but a lottery in which you draw a ticket for the grand-monde or the demi-monde, if you are ambitious ; if humble, then you must be content to exist, and not complain if you fiud existence somewhat dull and monotonous. It was Mr. Lionel's habit always to take his wine and fruit, and smoke his cigarette in a different room from the one in which he had dined. The odour of departed cookery was too strong for his delicate sense of smell ; besides, a dining-room forty feet long is too big to be a cheerful place for two people to spend the evening in. The smoking-room, on the contrary, was all that could be desired. A"], [117, "CHIPPY FORMS A NEW ACQUAINTANCE. 105 Turkish divan stretched aloug the whole length of one Avail ; in the centre Avas an octagon table of black oak, on which Avere placed decanters and all the paraphernalia of an elaborate dessert ; easy chairs were scattered about in an orderly disorder ; and bright-coloured drapery of various hues com- pleted the Eastern character of the room. Works of art testified to the owner's qualities as a con- noisseur. There, hanging in the most perfect light, was a genuine Greuze ; in one corner stood a marble Aphrodite, a masterpiece from the studios of Italy; in another a Bacchus from the Salon of Paris. Between them, as if courting the union of wine and love, was a life-size painting of the modern French school : a woman Avhose face is the embodi- ment of beauty and voluptuous sensualism, Avhile all the details of her surroundings \u2014 the delicate net- work of the stocking, and the end of the cigarette carelessly tossed away, the half-emptied wine-glass and the barely tasted fruit \u2014 show the minute study which has been expended on them.

Statuary, pictures"], [118, "106 CHIPPY FORMS A NEW ACQUAINTANCE. and china abounded in every place ; the very cigar cabinet was of the choicest marqueterie ; the oriental rugs, as they lay on the polished oak floor, were like moss beneath the feet; the tout ensemble was a perfect combination of luxury and comfort. The dinner had passed off more silently than usual, for Chippy was lost in thought about his adventure of the afternoon, and the two men had adjourned to the smoking-room. Since he had parted Avith her at the railway station, it had struck Chippy that Mrs. Saxondale's face was not wholly unfamiliar to him ; and now that he stood looking absently at the water-colours over the mantel-shelf, it suddenly dawned upon him where he had seen her. There was her face staring at him now from one of the frames. \" Whose portrait is this, father ? Or is it supposed to be anybody's ? \" Mr. Lionel took his cigarette from his mouth, and gazed languidly at the picture. \" That, Chippy, is a portrait of the once cele brated Geramis; and a very good likeness it is, too.\" \" And who was Geramis ? \""], [119, "CHIPPY FORMS A NEW ACQUAINTANCE. 107 \" Ah ! she Avas before your day, or else such a question would have astonished me. Not that any body ever knew who she really was before she became such a star. It must be fifteen years since she took Paris by storm.\" \"An actress, I suppose?\" \"Yes, but it was her beauty more than her act ing that the world raved about. She came from New York, where she had made a great hit, and Paris went mad over her. I heard she had tempt ing offers to come to London, but she refused them. Anyhow, after two seasons in Paris she retired altogether.\" \" Did you ever know her ? \" \" No. I have seen her on the stage, that's all. \" But Geramis could not have been her real name ? \" \" Of course not ; but it was the name she appeared by ou the bills.\" \" And you never heard her real name ? \" \" No !

But she repulsed all Avould-be lovers, not even excepting royalty, so it was said."], [120, "103 CHIPPY FORMS A NEW ACQUAINTANCE. Iufact, her virtue was talked about almost as much as her beauty. It is not often that such an anomaly is met with as a virtuous actress on the Parisian stage. But why do you take all this interest about her?\" \" The portrait here reminded me of a woman I had met, only this is the portrait of a much younger woman.\" \" Then it is more likely to be the same. Geramis grown old; \" and Mr. Lionel sighed, as if the fact reminded him that he too was growing old. \" A chance acquaintance in London, I suppose ? \" \" Yes,\" replied the other. Nothing more was said of Geramis that evening ; but Chippy made an inward resolution to find out as soon as he could whether his new acquaintance was the professional beauty or not."], [121, "109 CHAPTER XI. MR. LIONEL MAKES A DISCOVERY. On the day following Chippy's adventure in the churchyard, Mr. Lionel was sitting in his study, looking over some papers Avhich required his atten- tion. Although his life almost bordered on the eccentric, he was scrupulously regular in his habits. Accustomed to the continental fashion of a late breakfast, he rarely sat down to that meal till after ten ; but by that time he had always done Avhat he considered the disagreeable part of his day's work. Although he seldom went outside his garden, he did not neglect his duties as a landlord \u2014 that is to say, he did not allow his property to fall into a state of dilapidation. Besides, even a literary hermit must not be forgetful of ways and means. Mr. Lionel detested what he called the prosaic character of money matters, but he recognised their im portance, and generally devoted his time before breakfast to business."], [122, "110 MR. LIONEL MAKES A DISCOVERY. \" If you please, sir, Joseph Denrow wishes to see >3 you. \" Show Denrow in here.\" What Mr. Lionel's relations were Avith the afore said Joseph Denrow, nobody exactly knew. Cer tainly Mr. Lionel himself could not have explained them. In fact, it would have been extremely hard for any one to say who Joseph Denrow was, and what was his vocation iu life. He could only be summed up as a very remarkable and very important per sonage, though his importance was confined to the limits of his native village. Beyond these limits he never even went, except for one day every year, when he walked to a church yard some six or seven miles away, where he re mained till evening, and then Avalked home again. That was his annual holiday. There was uo ap parent reason for his visit except professional zeal, for he fulfilled the post of sexton, a post of which he was exceedingly proud. For one thing, it was an hereditary office. His father had held it before him, and young Joe Avould in all probability be succeeded by his son. He was still called young Joe, in spite of being on the wrong side of fifty,"], [123, "MR. LIONEL MAKES A DISCOVERY. Ill because old Joe was alive. Certaiuly old Joe did nothing, except to hobble round and inquire after the health of the gentry, a touching attention on his part which the gentry appreciated by the be stowal of sundry half-crowns. Old Joe held the insignia and most of the emoluments of office, and young Joe did the work \u2014 a state of things not con fined to the family of Denrow. One of the duties which had descended from father to son was the duty of looking after Mr. Lionel's property and his affairs generally. There was a bailiff for that purpose ; but without the Den row help, the bailiff would have been useless. How could that functionary tell whether it was right that Mr. Lionel should give five shillings towards buying a new cow for old Mother Bunchet ? Old Joe would like to see the man who could answer that question. As nobody ever did answer it, old Joe's authority remained undisputed. He also collected some small accounts for Mr. Lionel, which he in variably made out as money due to \" Messrs. Den row and Lionel.\" This method of procedure, how ever, had been altered on the accession of young Joe to office; for young Joe had the bump of"], [124, "112 MR. LIONEL MAKES A DISCOVERY. respectful obedience more largely developed than his father, and looked upon Mr. Lionel as his master, which meant a sort of being altogether superior to himself. \" Good- morning, Joe,\" said Mr. Lionel plea santly. \" Well, what's the news to-day ? \" Joe looked round nervously; then, twitching at his hat, he answered, \" Please, sir, she came again yesterday, sir.\" \"Ah, yes ; it's about a year since she was here before. She came just in the same way, I suppose \u2014 left a wreath, and then went away ? \" \" No, sir ; not quite the same, sir. She saw the young master, and he went back with her to the station.\" \" The devil she did ! \" exclaimed Mr. Lionel. \" Tell me more exactly how it happened.\" \" Well, sir, it be's this way, sir,\" replied Joe, in his native dialect, which it would be vain to repro duce, especially as it was rendered all the more unintelligible by his being somewhat frightened at the master's surprise. \"You see, sir, she laid the wreath on the grave just as usual, and was about to call at the cottage for me, sir; but I'd seen 'er, so"], [125, "MR.

And then he comes out with her, opening the gate for her as if she were a queen, and she's 'andsome enough for one too ; and they Avent across the fields to the station ; and that be's all I knows about it, sir,\" said Joe, to whom such a lengthy speech was evidently a matter of great exertion. Mr. Lionel seemed lost in thought for some moments. Then, as if struck by a sudden idea, he got up from his chair and walked towards the door. \" Come with me, Joe.\" Mr. Lionel led the Avay into the smoking-room, Joe following in a state of great bewilderment, Avhich increased almost to lunacy when he looked at the luxuries around him. \" Is this picture anything like her ? \" asked Mr. i"], [126, "Ill MR.

Joe had nothing else to communicate that morn ing, so he pocketed his douceur and took his depar ture, not forgetting to call for his morning glass at the kitchen on his way. Mr. Lionel leant back in his chair with the air of a man to whom thought is painful. For many years he had been striving to forget all that was bitter in the past, and he had partially succeeded. But there were times Avhen recollections forced themselves upon him, and the present was one of these times. He had never been the same man since the death of his eldest son \u2014 the son of Avhom he had been so proud, on whom he had lavished all the fond affec tion of a father, iu whose young life he had seen himself live again. Then came the blow \u2014 the bloAv which broke his Avife's heart and made his own future a dreary blank. Yet to his nature that bloAv had beeu to a small extent softened by the"], [127, "MR.

It was true that, if it had not been for her, his son might be still alive ; yet she had loved him, and Mr. Lionel, in remodelling his will after the death of his wife, had bequeathed a large legacy to her. On his return from Italy, he learnt that a lady had been in the habit of coming every summer to Bourne churchyard, and leaving a wreath of white flowers on his son's grave. This lady he immedi ately concluded could be no other than Mrs. Mas singer. Still, he had purposely abstained from making himself known to her, or even from look^ ing at her. She reverenced the memory of his son, and the father reverenced her feelings \u2014 let her remain ignorant that he was aware of her existence. And now his younger sou knew her ; nay, he might even know that she was Mrs. Massinger. Better, perhaps, that he should know it, if she had thought fit to tell him. If not, then he would keep her secret. For had they not both mourned for the same person ? And this Avoman who had haunted his memory,"], [128, "116 MR.

She had been the idol of Paris ; princes, even emperors had worshipped her, and sued in vain for her love. For two years she had had the most brilliant career that ever fell to the lot of au actress ; and then came the report that she had retired into private life. And Geramis and Mrs. Massinger were the same person \u2014 the person who never missed paying an an nual pilgrimage to the little churchyard at Bourne. The actress, the gambler, thc woman faithful to her dead lover, were one and the same. Dramatic pretence, vicious excitement, and life long loyalty, \u2014 what a trinity of qualities ! Or can a woman change her character as easily as she can change her dress ? Is she only the crea ture of caprice ? \"Yes,\" replies the misogynist Avitli a sneer; and the fool avIio apes the man of the Avorld echoes the reply. But, in spite of cynicism and in spite of folly, chivalry is not yet dead."], [129, "MR. LIONEL MAKES A DISCOVERY. 117 As if to dispel these freaks of scepticism, Mr. Lionel smoothed back the hair from his forehead, and rose from his chair. \" At all events, I will see this woman,\" he said to himself as he went into the breakfast-room, where he found Chippy waiting for him. In this instance there was never much confi dence between father and son ; they saw so little of one another that it was well-nigh impossible. Mr. Lionel was not the man to force his son to make any revelations against his own free will; yet at the present time he wished to know the name and address of Geramis. After the usual morning salutations, they both ate their breakfast in silence. They were both thinking of the same person, unknown to themselves. At last Mr. Lionel got up, and lighting a cigarette, said, \u2014 \" I have been wondering, Chippy, whether this acquaintance of yours is really Geramis.\" Chippy was completely taken by surprise. \" How curious, sir !

August, September, and October \u2014 those three months of the year so wearisome to men who don't shoot \u2014 had made great alterations, in more way*s than one, to the affairs of Captain Stanhope. In the first place, he had retired with the rank of major \u2014 a rare thing for a man so young. Why he had thus chosen to become an unattached idler about town, nobody knew. He w*as not a man prone to take people much into his confidence ; and if he had been, his reasons were of too vague a nature to be put into words. That he wanted more time for hunting and riding steeplechases was the ostensible cause. Perhaps the unfortunate issue of his love matters had something to do with it ; last, but not least, perhaps he had a longing for in dependence, to be perfectly free to act on his own impulses, to be untrammelled by any restraint ; in 1:0"], [133, "ON THE TRACK. 121 short, to do Avhatever he liked \u2014 a pernicious desire, no doubt, but which, if attained, is popularly sup posed to be fraught with great enjoyment. It is half-past eleven, and the Major, as he must henceforth be called, is standing in his sitting room in Dover Street, surveying a luxurious break fast table laid for three people. Not that it is his first appearance, by any means. The Major con sidered that if a man stayed up till three o'clock iu the morning, dancing in a bad atmosphere, or smoking and playing cards in one still more intoler able, a pick-me-up AA'as not sufficient to restore him to the normal condition of health, unless he was ambitious to have his constitution ruined before he Avas forty ; therefore, if he had indulged in more dissipation than was good for him overnight, it was his habit to take a good walk round the park before breakfast in the morning : it cooled the brain and stimulated the appetite. He looks now as if the frosty November air had made him satisfied Avith himself, and as if he meant to enjoy the morning meal. He has not long to wait before his two guests put in an appearance. \" Bring up breakfast, Hamp,\" he says to his ser-"], [134, "122 ON THE TRACK. vant, and that perfectly trained functionary does not take two minutes before he appears again with tea, coffee, kidneys, eggs, and all the etcetera of a substantial morning repast. \" What time did you get home last night ? \" \" After five. I played Owen ecarte after you left, and felt precious chippy this morning. A brandy-and-soda too much, I suppose.\" The speaker, Mr. John A. Goldmore, of New York, railroad man, Avas a fair example of a well-bred American \u2014 that is to say, he did not indulge in a nasal twang, had piles of shekels, and did not talk of them. His companion, Lord Owen, was an Irish peer, a great authority in clubland and on the race course, a bachelor, good-looking, though fifty years had told their tale on his face, and rather popular in society. Such Avere the Major's two guests, \" And Goldmore had the luck of the old gentle man himself,\" replied his lordship, as he commenced operations on the kidneys. \" He always has.

Why, that's the country where Sir Henry Belgart lives, whom you were asking me about the other day.\" \" Yes, he's got a country seat, Belgart Towers, down there.\" The Major had, in fact, lost no time in prosecuting his inquiries both about Sir Henry and Muirsom, and, as far as they Avent, the results had been satis- factory. He had ascertained, partly from Lord Owen and partly from others whose recollections of the turf went back to the time when Sir Henry Belgart kept racehorses, that the Baronet, without plunging heavily enough to make himself in any way conspicuous, must nevertheless have lost very considerable sums of money. He had also heard rumours that he had been obliged to mortgage his estates. In regard to Muirsom, he meaut to hear more this morning. He had heard Goldmore casually mention that he had known a man named Muirsom once when the name had been brought up in an after-dinner conversation at the club, and he thought he might glean some useful information."], [136, "124 ON THE TRACK. \"Ah! Belgart Towers,\" continued Lord Owen. \" That was the place they said he mortgaged to pay off his racing debts. He's got a daughter, hasn't he?\" \" Yes : she's engaged to be married to a fellow with lots of tin \u2014 a man named Muirsom : a coun- tryman of yours, I believe, Goldmore.\" \" Muirsom ! I once knew a Muirsom, years ago, in New York \u2014 Bertie Muirsom.\" \" Well, that's the name of this man.\" \" What's he like to look at ? \" i \" Oh ! tall, dark, good-looking, and about forty. Good man on a horse, and keeps a very snug little hunting-box. They say he's rather clever \u2014 literary tastes, and all that sort of thing. But I don't know him well enough to say myself. Seems to have seen a lot of the world, but otherwise a bit of a mystery.\" \" Well, if it's the Bertie Muirsom I mean, I can tolerably well clear up the mystery.\" \" Go on. I take an interest in all mysteries,\" chimed iu his lordship. \"All right. Not that there is anything par ticularly interesting, though. This Muirsom had a"], [137, "ON THE TRACK. 125 father \u2014 most people have, you will say. But Muir som senior was peculiar. He was a philosopher in his small way, and, like most philosophers, never took any trouble to pile up the shekels, and con sequently died poor. Muirsom junior, however, had an uncle, as well as a philosophical father, Avho was Avilliug to adopt him, and would have done so but for some family quarrel or other. After his father's death, young Muirsom suddenly disappears from New York, and doesn't turn up again for eighteen months or so, Avhen he walks into the club as cool as a cucumber, as if he hadn't been away more than a week. Soon afterwards, the avuncular relative kicks up his heels, aud to the surprise of everybody, in spite of the old quarrel, leaves all his tin to our mutual friend.\" \" Jolly for him ; and shows the old gentleman had a proper family disposition,\" remarked his lordship, with his mouth full of toast. \" But where does the mystery come in ? \" \" The only mysterious part was his long absence. They said he had been about Texas, and all that part of the world.\" \" What the deuce was he doing ? \""], [138, "126 ON THE TRACK. \"Gambling, so it Avas said; and he never took the trouble to contradict it. It was rather a com mon thing for fellows who had a taste for adven ture to go down San Francisco Avay and risk their dollars aud their lives; for there were plenty of stray bullets knocking about.\" \"The law was not held iu that proper respect Avhich it should have been.\" \" As far as I can make out, the only law was a six-shooter.\" \" I don't think I shall give San Francisco the honour of my company. I was always of a peaceful disposition.\" And, to give extra truth to his statement, Lord Owen lit a cigar, and tumbled into an armchair. \" At all events, there is some excitement in the life,\" resumed Goldmore ; \" and if all that you did was known in the drawing-rooms of civilized society, Mephistopheles would not be in the betting. Most fellows take an assumed name for fear of any ugly scandal.\" \"And did our friend Muirsom belong to this Avild brigade of free-lances ? \" asked the Major. \" I suppose so. But he retired honourably, as"], [139, "ON THE TRACK. 127 they say. After all, it's very like you London fellows going for a short sojourn to the South of Europe. The New York Johnnies make tracks for Texas. San Francisco and Boulogne : the one stands in much the same position to New York as the other does to London.\" \" But Muirsom came over to England very soon after this honourable retirement,\" said the Major, with a slight sneer on the last two words. \"Yes. I believe his mother was English, or something ; at all events, he always had a hankering to settle doAvn on this side of the water.\" \"And apparently has attained his object, since you say he is going to marry Belgart's only daughter, eh, Stanhope ? \" \" Looks like it, doesn't it ? He pays off the mortgages, and eventually gets Belgart Towers. That seems to be his plan of campaign.\" \" Which don't meet with your approval, my fine friend,\" muttered Lord Oweu to himself. His lord ship was no bad hand at guessing, and could put two and two together as well as most men. \" The Major either is, or has been, in love with this Bel gart girl, and Muirsom has cut him out,\" thought"], [140, "128 ON THE TRACK. his lordship; but he kept his thoughts to him self. \" He was a good sort, was Bertie Muirsom,\" said Goldmore in a ruminating tone. \" I should like to see him again.

He would make a good husband, and he's a fellow to be proud of.\" \" On the principle that au ex-poacher makes a good gamekeeper.\" \" Don't see how the principle applies,\" replied Goldmore, looking inquiringly at the Major. \" Why, because he was a Avild, gambling free-lance, aud therefore all the more inclined to settle down aud become domesticated, and all that sort of thing.\" \" You speak as if spending eighteen months iu Texas damned a man for life.\" \" Not likely to add to his social reputation, I should say.\" The Major was becoming slightly nettled, and, moreover, felt that he was betraying his hatred for Muirsom ; two things which he particularly desired not to do. His last remark was brusque, aud he"], [141, "ON THE TRACK. 129 knew it directly he had spoken. He added some what hastily, \" I mean, you know, suppose a London man had been knocking about Boulogne for a couple of years, Clubland would not be over-anxious to give him a hearty welcome on his return.\" \" Depends on the man,\" said Lord Owen, atten tively regarding the ash of his cigar. \" Well, I don't think a bottle of the sparkling will do us any harm at this stage of the day,\" said the Major, ringing the bell. His innuendoes against his rival had fallen flat, and champagne was the best thing to remedy the mistake. After all, he had gained some information, which might be turned to account. The champagne was brought and drunk ; and his second cigar being finished, Lord Owen rose to go. Goldmore followed his example, and tho two left together. \" That fellow has got a grudge against Muirsom,\" remarked the American, as they turned into Pic cadilly. \" Fancy he was sweet on the Belgart girl,\" said his lordship. \" And would cut out Muirsom if he could.

Our friend the Major isn't in the running, I should say, judging from my recollec tions of old Sir Henry Belgart.\" Meanwhile, Major Stanhope Avas summing up in his own mind the results of his morning's hospi tality. The first point which seemed clear to him Avas that Sir Henry Avas selling his daughter in order to pay off some mortgages ; but, if the daughter was Avilling to be sold, it would be im possible for him to interfere. Therefore his infor mation so far counted as nothing. In regard to Muirsom, the results were far from satisfactory. Goldmore was a friend of his, aud spoke well of him, and he had shown his hand to Goldmore. Except that eighteen months' absence from New York, there Avas absolutely nothing from which anything useful might be extracted. Besides, if he was by any means to prevent this marriage, he must act immediately ; there was uo time to lose, for Sir Henry* would uot be likely to delay an event which could prove so advantageous to himself."], [143, "ON THE TRACK. 131 For a moment the fact of Walter Lionel's death flashed across his mind. He had been killed iu San Francisco by one of these gambling free-lances. Was it not barely possible that Muirsom might be in some way connected with that affair ? It was a hundred-to-one chance, but the Major clutched at it like the drowning man clutches at a straw. Revenge is sweet, but it is often doubtful whether its sweetness compensates for all the trouble spent in gaining it. Here was the Major prosecuting his inquiries like an amateur detective, and expending an infinite amount of time, trouble, and thought, because he had been jilted by a girl he loved. Probably the two feelings of the human heart most closely akin to one another are the feelings of love and hatred. Major Stanhope Avas not different from the majority of men, who, when their love has been refused, are unable to quietly accept the situation by changing their passion into a platonic friendship, nor did he pause to reflect on Avhat would be the result if his hatred for Muirsom was satisfied. So do most of us act in accordance with impulse, instead of with mature reflection."], [144, "CHAPTER XIII. AFTERNOON TEA. The next day Major Stanhope went down to Haysey. Now that he had retired, he found it more con venient to keep his stud, and take small lodgings in the little agricultural town, than billeting himself on his brother. For one thing, like most good riders with limited incomes, he knew hoAv to buy a young horse cheap, and sell him at a profit ; or, in other words, how to carry on the business of a gentleman horse-dealer \u2014 a business which could hardly be satisfactorily transacted at the stables of his brother. Then Haysey was a central point in the South Grass-shire country, and a favourite resort of many hunting men of the rapid kind. In short, it suited the Major, so there the Major weut, and kept his hunters, not forgetting a high dog-cart and a fast-trotting mare ; for the Stan hopes Avere an old county family, and dinner parties and afternoon calls on non-hunting days 1\"3"], [145, "AFTERNOON TEA. 133 had to be attended to; so in the country roads and lanes the high dog-cart soon became a familiar sight. For gossip and mild flirtation, there is nothing equal to country society. There is so little to do, and that little so often left undone, that the doings of one's neighbours form a welcome subject to talk about. Afternoon tea, especially with its many opportunities for tete-a-tetes, is responsible for more scandal than any other social institution. If Sheri dan were alive now, Lady Teazle would be presiding at her tea-table at Sir Peter's country seat, and the screen scene would take place in the conservatory. Grass-shire was far from being an exception to the rule. The most popular house for these defamatory and amatory visits was Scankennel Hall, the seat of the Earl of Scankennel. When hounds did not meet, the Countess was generally to be found seated in her drawing-room, dressed in an unapproachable tea-gown, surrounded by all the paraphernalia of tea, including her two pretty daughters, Lady Constance and Lady Florence. If one felt inclined for tropical ferns, low garden seats, a cigarette, and a tete-a tete, one only had to step through a window into"], [146, "134 AFTERNOON TEA. tho conservatory ; so that it need hardly be said the Countess, as a rule, had plenty of callers of both sexes. Thither the Major found himself driving one wintry afternoon, soon after he had come dowu from town. Not that he particularly cared about the Countess, or that she particularly cared about him ; but he thought he should hear Aura Belgart's engagement freely discussed, and that he himself might have the opportunity of dropping some carefully worded innuendoes in regard to Muirsom's antecedents. Nor was he mistaken; for he had not been in the drawing-room five minutes before Lady Constance, who had some suspicion that the Major had been more than a little in love with Aura, said to him,\u2014 \" Oh ! by the bye, Major, you have heard, of course, of Miss Belgart's engagement to Mr. Muirsom. What do you think of it ? \"' \" Well, Lady Constance, really, you kuow, I think the best person to answer that question is Sir Henry Belgart himself. I know next to nothing of the happy bridegroom that is to be.\" \" Don't you ? \" chimed in the Countess. \" How"], [147, "AFTERNOON TEA. 135 provoking ! Nobody does seem to know anything about him. Don't you even know where he comes from, Major Stanhope ? \" \"America \u2014 at least, so I have been told; but that is rather vague, isn't it ? \" \" Yes, except that all Americans are supposed to have money, and I suppose this Mr. Muirsom is no expection to the rule.

I believe Muirsom has spent a good portion of his life in San Francisco.\" \" What, that horrid place where everybody shoots one another ! \" \" Well, life is held cheap there, I've been told.\" \" Why, it Avas at San Francisco that Sir Henry Belgart's nephew, young Walter Lionel, got shot,\" remai-ked the Countess. \" I wonder Sir Henry does not hate everybody who comes from the place, for his sister died in consequence.

What do you mean, Major Stanhope ? Please don't speak in riddles. You rouse my curiosity without satisfying it.\" \" Oh ! I mean, supposing I had to fly from my creditors, or got into some scrape or other, I should go down to the South of Europe ; be at home abroad, you know. Well, if I lived in New York, I should go to San Francisco \u2014 not that I mean to suggest that Muirsom got into any scrape, for upon my Avord I am as ignorant as you are upon the subject.\" \"Everybody who goes to the South of Europe, Major Stanhope, has not gone to avoid his debts, or because he thinks that the time has come for him for disappearing.\" \" Don't misinterpret my meaning, Lady Florence. I don't for a moment mean to suggest that there is anything about Muirsom which is not quite above-board.\" Lady Florence always took an especial delight in"], [149, "AFTERNOON TEA. 137 tormenting the Major whenever she could. His imperturbable sang-froid prevented her getting very many opportunities of gratifying this inclination ; but at the present time she saw it was the Major's object to make people question Muirsom's character: not that she minded the object in the least, but the spirit of contradiction, strong in all women, was particularly strong Avith Lady Florence. So she determined to make the Major commit himself to something more definite, by taking up the cudgels on behalf of Muirsom ; for she made certain that he knew more than he chose to tell about that gentleman. \"But Mr. Muirsom could hardly have gone to San Francisco to avoid his creditors, could he ? For he is supposed to be very rich.\" \" Perhaps not. I know that he did not get his money, though, till after his visit to San Francisco, when a relative of his died and left him all his money.

For instance, there AYas the death of young Lionel out there.\" \" But that has got nothiug to do with Mr. Muir- \u25a0; som. \"Certainly not; it only proves the character of the place.

I wonder how long it took you to compose it. But seriously, then, you and Mr. Muirsom are not friends ? \" \"We are not enemies, at all events.\" If anybody had called the Major a liar at that moment, he Avould have considered it an insult. \"I don't know him sufficiently Avell to call him my friend. We are only acquaintances.\" \" A distinction Avithout much difference.\" \" So far as modern society is concerned, I per fectly agree with you.\""], [152, "140 AFTERNOON TEA. \" Now you're sarcastic ; and I always think it is awfully rude to be satirical.\" \" Then I won't offend again.

However, I hope your criticism will be favourable ; \" aud the Major rose to go. \" Now if you find out anything about the dark horse, you must let me know,\" said the Countess, as sho shook hands with him. \" If I do, I will ; \" and tho Major went. Directly the door was closed, Lady Constance said, \u2014 \" Well, Florence, you were hard on the poor man, telling him he had tastes in common with Mr."], [153, "AFTERNOON TEA. 141 Muirsom. I believe he really was seriously in love with Aura Belgart, and must feel the blow of her engagement. It is very clear that he doesn't love Mr. Muirsom.\" \"Therefore, if there is anything against him, he will be sure to tell us,\" remarked the Countess. \" I wonder if he ever proposed; but Sir Henry Belgart is not the man to embrace a younger son as a son in-law.\" Both Lady Florence and Lady Constance were silent. Younger sons, or rather, the defamation of younger sons, was the Countess's favourite hobby. She considered, like many dowagers, that they formed the most numerous species of the genus ad venturer ; and with that absence of logical argument which is the peculiar trait of the feminine mind, made the whole class suffer for the sins of some few members. Owing to the modern system of educa tion in Avhich younger sons are brought up, there is little doubt that many of them eventually develop into social hawks, though they are far from forming the majority. Briefly, that system is precisely simi lar to the system used with their elder brothers. They arc sent to the same school, the same univer-"], [154, "142 AFTERNOON TEA. sity ; and at home are indulged with the same lux uries, and allowed to contract the same expensive habits. The inevitable result is that these younger sons find themselves launched into life with tastes which it would require an income five times as large as they possess to satisfy. They have only two alternatives \u2014 either to renounce the pleasures which have become second nature to them, or to discover some means, legitimate or otherwise, to enable them to continue to enjoy these pleasures. The latter alternative is the one more generally chosen ; so that we have a crowd of youug members of society living at five times the rate they ought to live at, with the consequence that they are ob liged to look out for themselves to gain from society in some way or other the wherewithal to do it. It can hardly be fair to say that they are altogether to blame, if in the mixed society of men and women the successful speculations of these young but knowing adventurers iu the matrimonial market sometimes cause much misery and suffering. They have studied the art of flirtation till it has become with them a science, Avhich they know hoAv to make remunerative. Many of them consider it to be al-"], [155, "AFTERNOON TEA. 143 most a matter of necessity that they should marry an heiress, or, at all events, a girl with sufficient money to keep the two. Such is the course which their pecuniary embarrassments force them to take. Love is left out of their calculations altogether, ex cept so far as they may find it useful to simulate it ; and then, when too late, the young wife finds that she has married a man whom affection for her money has caused to pretend affection for herself. The parents are angry that their daughter has been foolish enough to fall in love with a man Avhose banking account is phenomenal; and the young adventurer himself will hardly prove to be a model husband. So on all sides is there unhappiness ; though the person who suffers most and is the most deserving of pity is the wife. For, experienced as society girls are, or rather, to speak more correctb*, think themselves, they are very often not mistresses of their own hearts, and so fall a prey to the first hawk greedy after their money.

Yet those people who love to throw a stone at the already much-abused class of younger sons may take some comfort from the fact that the Countess of Scankennel and her sisters, the auctioneers in the matrimonial market, do their best to destroy the social claims of these aspirants to the favours of their daughters.

The hat, the pink coat, buckskins, and boots were all of the correct make, and correctly put on. There was nothing which even a Melton Mowbray swell could have found fault with. His seat, firm and easy, made him look as if he were part aud parcel of his horse.

The Major was a profi cient master in the science of conditioning hunters, and Daisy looked as if nothing could pass her.

Daisy was a pure thoroughbred, one of the sort that will gallop till they drop, Avith hardly an ounce of superfluous flesh on her : hard as nails, in fact \u2014 just the mount one would like to have in a good thing. \" Well, here we are ! \" said the Honourable"], [159, "A FALSE MOVE. 147 Jack Fulton to Stanhope, as, turning a corner, they came in full sight of the hounds. \" Deuce of a lot of people out on wheels !

Arthur, the huntsman, very quietly but none the less quickly, has his hounds out of covert ; and then, after one burst of music which Orpheus would have envied, up go their sterns, and there seems every prospect of a good thing. \" Whoa ! No hurry, little woman. Thank the stars we're on the right side to-day, Stanhope.\" They were in a thirty-acre grass field, bounded on all sides by an impracticable bull-finch, except in one corner, where there was a stiff post and rails, exposing to view a yawning ditch on the further side. The Major's practised eye took in the situa tion at a glance, and he sat down to race Daisy for the corner, and secure his advantage by being first over \u2014 no small advantage when the place to be negotiated requires the pace to be put on ; and there is only one spot where it is negotiable. \" Nasty place for your first jump, my lady."], [162, "150 A FALSE MOVE. That's right, get your legs well under you. Bravo ! Good enough for the Grand National,\" muttered the Major, as he lauded in the next field ten lengths ahead of any rival, and saw the hounds streaming across in front of him, while, spread out before his gaze, were fields after fields of open country, without a bush sufficient to shelter a fox. Crash, crash ! somebody come a purler at the rails, which will cause a little delay to his followers, and give the Major a longer lead. No hurry now : as near to the hounds as he dare ride without pressing on them, he could sit down and enjoy the dearest of all sights to a hunting man \u2014 the sight of a thoroughly efficient pack in full cry over an open country. Four, five more fields are crossed before others, by dint of hard galloping, mauage to come up. But they do manage it, aud to the annoyance of the Major, the first flight consists of some dozen or so. There is a habit, too \u2014 Miss Belgart's, of course \u2014 and Sir Henry himself, who, Avheu he gets a good start, can ride with the best of them : Muirsom looking as cool as if he were cantering up the Row, and the Honourable Jack looking as hot as only a"], [163, "A FALSE MOVE. 151 wild young puller could make him. Over a stiffish binder, and they are on the plough. Now is the time for the thoroughbreds, who skim lightly over it, while their less well-bred companions show signs of rolling heavily. A drop fence at the end, and again they are on the turf. \" Muirsom's down ; deuced nearly jumped on the top of him. Can't stop this beast at the fences \u2014 she rushes as if she Avere mad.\" Stanhope glanced round. \" His horse has got off, too. He will have to finish this run on foot.\" The fields now were beginning to get smaller and the obstacles more frequent. The little red rover, too, was not running as straight as at first. The Major once more, after cleverly negotiating a double, found himself alone Avith hounds. His capital eye to a country now came to his help, for even Daisy was beginning to show signs of being done. She did not pull herself together at her fences as gamely as at the start, and hung a bit on the bridle. Well, she has gone as well as any of them, he thought, as he encouragingly patted her neck and looked around. \" By Jove ! only Aura Belgart in the same field"], [164, "152 A FALSE MOVE. with me. She does ride \u2014 no mistake about it. Women are curious creatures. I should have thought a girl like that would have been too straight to be a jilt. And yet, how I love her still ! Whoa ! gently does it, my beauty. There's a nasty drop. Hold up ! You nearly kissed mother-earth that time.\" The Major turned round in his saddle to see how Aura got over; but her horse was tired, and failed to rise. The fence partially gave way, but Avas too strong to yield altogether, with the result that the animal came down on his knees and head, and, after one ineffectual attempt to recover himself, rolled over. Turning his horse round as quickly as he could, Stanhope rode up and dismounted. Luckily Aura had fallen clear, but she was lying on the ground apparently insensible. Hurriedly tying the two horses to a stake, Stanhope's next action Avas to gentl}' raise her head, and fan her face with his pocket-handkerchief. Still she showed no sign of consciousness ; so returning to his horse to get his saddle-flask, he tried to pour some brandy be tween her lips. To haA*e a pretty girl's head resting on one's"], [165, "A FALSE MOVE. 153 knee is a trying position for any man, whoever the lady may be. But when that lady happens to be the only girl one ever loved, and has been the chief subject of one's thoughts for months past, the temptation becomes exceedingly great. At least, it proved too strong for Major Stanhope, as he sat on the grass leaning over Aura. He had taken off her hat, and the fresh wind was playing with her auburn hair as she lay there on her back with upturned face. \" Oh ! my darling, I can never cease to love you,\" he murmured ; and he pressed his lips against her forehead. Either the words or the action restored Aura to consciousness. She opened her eyes, only to meet those of Stanhope, which showed but too plainly the passion of his love. Yes, he had kissed her ; she knew it, and blushed deeply with anger as she tried to raise herself. With difficulty she got on to her feet ; then, look ing Stanhope straight in the face, she said, \u2014 \" I always thought you were a gentleman, Major Stanhope ; but I see I have been labouring under a mistake.\" \" You are hard on me, Miss Belgart. Aura, I"], [166, "154 A FALSE MOVE. love you, and I always shall love you, whatever happens. I can't help myself. I am sorry if I have offended you, and ask your forgiveness for forgetting myself. But, come, are you hurt ? \" \" Not much, thanks \u2014 only a little shaken ; but I don't think I could ride home \u2014 I feel giddy.\" \" There's a lane within fifty yards ; if you could walk as far, there may be a chance of getting a con veyance of some sort to take you home.\" They walked silently to the gate leading into the lane before the girl said, \u2014 \"Don't think me ungrateful for your kindness. 1 have robbed you of a splendid run, and given you a lot of trouble.\" \" Don't mention it ; as it was, my horse had had almost if not quite enough, and I should have been obliged to stop, or else come a cropper myself. I hear the sound of wheels. How lucky ! The Scan kennels' carriage. They will drive you home, and I will see to your horse.\" \" Thank you ; but I am ashamed to give you so much trouble.\" \" No trouble. And you will forgive me ? \" he added, after a pause."], [167, "A FALSE MOVE. 155 \" This once. But please remember in future that I am engaged to be married to Mr. Muirsom.\" The Major bit his lips, and bowed. Not only the words, but the tone of her voice, told him plainly that there Avas no hope left. That kiss had been a false move on his part. He hailed the carriage, and told the Countess the accident which Aura had met with. \" My dear Miss Belgart, I am so sorry. I do hope you are not seriously hurt. How very fortunate that we happened to be passing ! Don't say any thing; I am only too delighted to be of any service. Besides, it is hardly at all out of our way to drive round by Belgart Towers.\" So Aura was carried off, and the Major was left to console himself with an empty flask, and the un pleasant prospect of having to lead Aura's horse home, a distance of at least a dozen miles. \" Ugh ! you brute,\" he muttered at the innocent cause of his misfortunes. Then, remounting Daisy, he turned into the lane, and made for the nearest inn, where he managed to secure a boy, who, for a slight consideration, was perfectly ready to take Aura's horse home."], [168, "156 A FALSE MOVE. \"Thank goodness for that; and now for Haysey myself, I suppose, for there is no chance of seeing hounds again to-day,\" he said to himself. The Major's reflections during his afternoon ride home were hardly as pleasant as they had been in the morning on his ride to covert. In the first place, he had a conscience, and his conscience told him that he had not only been guilty of committing an ungentlemanly act, but what was worse had been found out. That last speech of Aura's, when she told him to remember that she was engaged to Muirsom, seemed to be the funeral knell to any hopes he might entertain of robbing his rival of her love. The only straw left to him to catch at was that something might happen to bring utter dis grace on Muirsom before the marriage took place; and even then he would be in the somewhat humi liating position of having to play second fiddle. \"After all, what is the good of my playing out a game which is already a foregone conclusion ? \" he asked himself. \" Yet, on the other hand, a game is never lost until it's won ; and this game could only bo finished by marriage. Yes, I Avill play it out now to the bitter end ; all is fair in love and war,"], [169, "A FALSE MO VE. 157 and if by any means I can get Mr. Muirsom in my poAver \u2014 AveU, I'll let him know it.\" Whatever his friendship might be worth, there Avas no doubt the Major was a good hater ; and he had good cause for hating Muirsom. To do him justice, he had never played a Avoman false ; Aura Belgart was the only girl to whom he had ever pro fessed love, and she had iu plain words jilted him. It had been a severe blow ; but what angered him most was that she had preferred another. Another had taken his place, that was the galliug part. The Major, like most men, had had many little flir tations with sin, but his honour had always been spotless. Now his passionate craving after revenge was making him do acts which were mean and almost dishonourable; it was warping his mind and totally changing his character. And he knew it, and that was the bitterest pill. He knew it, and despised himself accordingly; but had not the power to subdue his passion. He felt that he was no longer a free agent, but must act in accordance with his fate. He was a slave, governed by a master who accepted no denial, and whose commands must be obeyed. He was only one out of"], [170, "158 A FALSE MOVE. many, who suddenly discover the irresistible force of human impulses and human passions. So it is ; and so it ever will be as long as the nature of man is adulterated with the alloy of evil. When after countless generations the human race in the on ward movement of its mental development has attained to the standard of absolute perfection, and by the annihilation of evil rendered all the prompt ings of passion abortive, then will fatalism die a natural death. But while the great mystery of evil still continues to penetrate the minds of men, and with ceaseless vibration sweeps o'er them, as it Avere, like a poisonous breeze, so long will the human heart be bound down under the dominion of the conflicting forces of good and evil, exciting the body to action according to the dictates of fate. Neither comprehending nor comprehensible, such is humanity on the face of the earth."], [171, "159 CHAPTER XV. THE WATCHER. To that class of men of which Major Stanhope may be taken as a fair type, exercise and plenty of it is essential. Nowhere, except in those novels which are the offspring of feminine imagination, can men sit up half the night drinking brandy and soda, and smoking large cigars, and the next day win steeplechases, and perform feats worthy of the heroes of Olympus. For a man to ride well across country, Avhether it be after hounds or between the flags, he must be in good condition, and \"as hard as nails.\" Nobody knew this better than the Major. Not only Avas he in the habit of constantly exercising his own horses, instead of leaving that necessary duty to the groom, but he would take long constitutional walks, often getting over several miles of country in a single afternoon. It was about a week after Aura's accident when the Major, after a substantial lunch, to which a"], [172, "THE WATCHER. 160 morning on horseback had given an extra relish, strolled out of Haysey, with the intention of taking one of his usual long rambles. By chance he happened to choose an old bridle path Avhich went by Muirsom's house, and skirting the woods round Belgart Towers, led into the turnpike road some two miles beyond. He had not gone far, before his notice was attracted by a woman walking in the same direction some little distance in front of him. Certainly there was nothing extraordinary in the sight of a petticoat on this particular path ; on the contrary, it Avas rather a favourite walk with the fair ones of Haysey, and the Major had reached that time of life when rustic amours lose their piquancy. Chippy in his pupil days might have derived the keenest enjoyment from flirting with the pretty daughter of the local grocer or candlestick maker, but to the mature man of the world these flirtations savoured somewhat of bread and butter. Yet now the Major slackened his pace, and regarded with critical admiration the figure before him. \" She's a deuced good mover. Wonder who on earth she is, for I'll bet she's not one of the natives,\" he muttered to himself."], [173, "THE WATCHER. 161 In these days of cheap locomotion, it is astonish ing how few Avomen there are who know how to Avalk. The majority of them waddle, Avhich, coupled with the present fashion in dress, renders the back view absurd in the extreme ; or else their tight boots make them step as gingerly as if they Avere walking between eggs. Modern society demands that our women should be brought up as hot-house plants, and that their only two duties should be to look pretty and dress becomingly. And even these two duties are seldom performed. But the object of the Major's admiration was evidently an exception to the rule. Regulating his pace so as to overtake her at a convenient stile, he unobtrusively proffered his assistance, and was rewarded by a smile of thanks from one of the handsomest faces he had ever seen, and a glimpse of an ankle which a premiere danseuse would have been proud to possess. \" I am a stranger in these parts. Could you tell me if that house belongs to Mr. Muirsom ? \" \" It does. You know him ? \" \" I used to know him some years ago, but only slightly,\" she replied with an air of indifference^ H"], [174, "162 THE WATCHER. \"and heard that he lived somewhere down here. Don't let me delay you.\" The tone of her last words was such as to leave the Major no other alternative but to raise his hat and walk on. But his curiosity was aroused. She appeared to be a lady, and she had asked Avhere Muirsom lived; anything which concerned -luirsom, concerned the Major, so the latter stifling any compunction which his conscience might cause him, determined to act the part of spy. With this object he quickened his pace, and making a short detour round a small spinny, overgrown with underwood, he mauaged again to get behind her without being observed. He then hurried towards a lane which ran alongside the field through which the bridle path went, and jumping lightly over the hedge, was able to keep her in sight without being seeu himself. She did not turn off to go up to the house, as he had first suspected she would do, but after standing still for a moment or so, as if doubtful in her mind as to Avhat course she should take, Avalked slowly on to the next stile where thc path crossed the lane. At this moment there was a sound of horses'"], [175, "THE WATCHER. 163 hoofs, and turning round the Major perceived Aura and Muirsom. What luck, he thought, we shall all four reach that stile at the same time, and then, if there is anything to know, I suppose I shall know it. With admirable precision the Major managed that the tAvo riders should overtake him at the stile, but to his surprise he could not see his new acquaint ance. A tall thick-set hedge divided the field from the lane ; was she hiding behind that ? he wondered. Aura and Muirsom pulled up their horses. \" I am glad to see you on horseback again, Miss Belgart. I trust you are none the worse for your fall.\" \"Not a bit, thanks. I was a little shaken at the time, that was all. I must thank you again for the gallaut way in which you came to my rescue.\" The slight stress she laid on the word \" gallant,\" irritated Stanhope. \" I was only too glad to be of any use,\" he said coldly. \" I had unfortunately had a spill myself,\" Muirsom casually remarked, \"and was miles away at the time. It must have been a capital run, though, for the few who were in it.\" \"The few consisted of Miss Belgart and myself,"], [176, "164 THE WATCHER. and neither of us Avere up at the finish. Your horse got away from you, didn't he ? \" Thc Major was not given to boasting of his prowess in thc field \u2014 few good riders are; but the sight of Muirsom and Aura together always made him angry, and he wished to show his superiority to his rival. \" AVe must be jogging on ; we are late already. Good afternoon, Major Stanhope.\" And touching her horse Avith her whip, she rode on. She had caught sight of the face of a woman Avatching them from the other side of the hedge as they stood chatting, and with the feminine habit of jumping immediately at conclusions, she had made up her mind that the Major was there to keep an appointment in some affaire d'amour. The horrid hypocrite, she thought to herself, Avhile she said aloud, \" Bertie, I should think the Major could have beaten Ananias ! \" \" Indeed ! I dare say he has found out that the truth is generally rude. But Avhat makes you say that ? Was he in reality very irritable when he assisted you the other day ? \" \" Oh, no.\" Aura was too much of a woman to have told Muirsom how Stanhope had kissed her;"], [177, "THE WATCHER. 165 perhaps at the time she had pitied him, although she had told him his conduct Avas ungentlemanly. ' I don't think he is a man to be trusted, that is all.\" To abuse a man, means to think about him. Muirsom would have preferred that Aura should be perfectly indifferent to Stanhope. He was silent for a moment, and then began to talk about some thing utterly different. Meanwhile the Major, happily unconscious of the fresh feelings which Aura held towards him, looked into the field to see if he could find his mysterious stranger, who seemed to be able to disappear at pleasure. Yes ; there she was, walking by the side of the hedge towards the stile. Two of us playing the part of spy, was his inward comment. \" Mr. Muirsom has just ridden by,\" he added aloud. \"I didn't know y*ou were there, or else I Avould have told him.\" \" I am very glad you did no such thing. If I had wanted to speak to him, I could have done so ; but I didn't come here this afternoon either to speak to or to see Mr. Muirsom.\" That's a lie, he thought. \" You know he is going to marry Miss Belgart, the lady who was with him ?\""], [178, "166 THE WATCHER. \" I know he is engaged to be married to her.\" For once in his life the Major felt at a loss how to act. His companion Avas evidently a lady, and as she gave him no encouragement to remain, he knew that as a gentleman he ought to go. But curiosity prevailed, and he determined to run the risk of either getting the snub direct, or of gaining some further information. \" AVe seem to have a mutual acquaintance in Mr. Muirsom ; may I waive ceremony and intro duce myself? I am Major Stanhope.\" She bowed distantly, as if it were a matter of the most absolute indifference to her whether he was Major Stanhope or anybody else. Slightly discourag ing even to a man of his social experience; but he was too blase to be much at a loss, so affected to con sider her distant bow a sign of extreme cordiality. \" Did you make Mr. Muirsom's acquaintance in America ? He came from there originally, I believe.\" \" Yes ; I met him in Chicago.\" The Major asked her many leading questions about Muirsom, but her answers were short and curt, like those of a hostile witness undergoing cross-examination."], [179, "THE WATCHER. 167 \" Are you staying long in Haysey ? I am afraid you regard all my feeble attempts at conversation as an impertinence, for you have not even favoured me with your name.\" \" I return to town by the evening train. No; I don't consider you impertinent; if I did, I should have told you so. Still it is hardly Avhat your society would call the proper way of making one another's acquaintance, is it ? \" \"Perhaps not; but after all, etiquette is a very foolish thing, invented to throw restraint over all social intercourse.\" \" I should have thought the fault of modern society was that there was too little restraint. In public you conform to the most elaborate rules of etiquette, but you make up for it by a pretty free licence in private. Ou the one hand, you find hypocrisy useful, and on the other you find morality decidedly inconvenient. I prefer a little less of the one and a little more of the other. You consider it ' bad form ' to be a prude, but if a woman appears in the divorce court, society not only cuts her, but won ders why they ever received such a naughty person.\" \"And yet the naughty person is always tho nicest.\""], [180, "168 THE WATCHER. \" Rather men do all they can to make nice women naughty. And now, Major Stanhope, I insist on your not accompanying me any further.\" \" But it is nearly two hours before the train starts for London.\" \" So I shall have plenty of time to get a cup of tea at the hotel before starting. Good-bye.\" \" You mustn't ask me to desert you in this way. I know that I ought to be awfully obliged to you for letting me escort you all this way, but \" \" But Avhat ? \" \"I wish you would increase the obligation by letting me offer you some tea. I live in Haysey for the sake of the hunting, and if you Avill only accept my bachelor hospitality \" \"I should be guilty of very improper conduct.\" \" Propriety is only a conventional term, consist ing in not being found out; besides \" \" Besides, I am old enough to take care of myself; that is what you wanted to say, only you thought it would sound rude.\" \" Then you Avill come ? \" \" Certainly not ; thanks very much all the same.\" \" Then let me come with you to the hotel. That won't be improper, at all events.\""], [181, "THE WATCHER. 169 \" Very well ; you may if you like. But why are you so persistent in your attentions towards a woman whose name you don't know even? \" \" Won't you tell me your name ? \" \"Mrs. Saxondale. But you don't answer my question.\" \" Because I don't know what answer to give. You interested me, I suppose.\" \" Indeed ! \" \" It sounds cool to say so, but it's the truth.\" So the Major went with her to the hotel, and afterwards escorted her to the station ; but in spite of one or two further attempts to draw her out in regard to Muirsom, he remained in perfect ignorance of what her relations might be with that gentleman. \" That man hates Muirsom,\" said Mrs. Saxon dale to herself, as she leant back in the railway carriage. \"I must ask Chippy about him.\" \"That woman knows more of Muirsom than she chose to tell me,\" thought the Major as he strolled back to his diggings. And they were both right in their conjectures."], [182, "170 CHAPTER XVI. TO BE, OR NOT TO BE. On the afternoon of the day following Mrs. Saxon dale's visit to Haysey, that lady was to be found sitting in her small but extremely pretty boudoir at her house iu Hamilton Terrace. She had given orders that she was not at home if anybody should happen to call, for she wished to be alone and quiet, so as to think over the discovei*y she had made only the day before, and, if possible, to resolve ou some plau of campaign. Chippy had inadvertently been the cause of her first suspecting that Herbert Muirsom and Hugh Massinger might be one and the same person. She had always thought that Massinger was iu England, aud had half wished, half dreaded to meet him ; but Chippy, Avho had lost no time in calling upon Mrs. Saxondale, and was on terms of considerable intimacy with her considering the short time they had been acquainted, had directed her ideas into"], [183, "TO BE, OR NOT TO BE. 171 a definite channel. In the confidence engendered by that platonic friendship which so often exists between a young man and a woman some fifteen years his senior, Chippy had told her all about Belgart Towers and his cousin Aura : from the lady to her fiance was but a short and natural step, and he had given her a detailed account about Muirsom, with the final consequence that Mrs. Saxondale determined to turn doubt into certainty, and to go down to Haysey to see for herself whether her vague suspicion was true. And it was true. Herbert Muirsom, the affianced husband of Sir Henry Belgart's daughter, was no other than Hugh Massinger, the gambling free lance. Although Mrs. Saxondale was perfectly prepared to find out that it was so, yet now she did know it, she was startled, and uncertain how to act. Should she silently acquiesce in a crime by allowing him to commit bigamy, or should she expose him ? It was no easy matter to decide, and Mrs. Saxondale leant back in her arm-chair before the fire to quietly review the situation. Her whole life passed before her like a dream as she sat there in the semi-darkness of a December"], [184, "TO BE, OR NOT TO BE. 172 afternoon in London. A life full of adventure and of thrilling incidents amounting almost to romance ; a life such as few women have led. Born and reared in the wildnesses of Texas, she had grown up like one of the native plants untrammelled by any of the artificiality of what the world calls education, and had blossomed forth into Avomanhood with beauty seldom surpassed. Then came Massinger : she had never seen any men before, but those who were the roughest of the rough ; no wonder that she loved him ; in her sight he was a sort of god, superior to other men. But, the first flush of passion over, her mother-wit had come to her aid. As his pupil, she soon began to know his world, and he played tho part of Mentor only too well. She forced him to marry her, though the flame of his love Avas Avcll-nigh extinguished ; matrimony was the only thing needful to make it die out altogether. Of physical cruelty he was incapable, but\"the silent torture to Avhich he subjected her was infinitely worse than mere bodily pain ; it was more than she could bear. So one day, although far on the road towards becoming a mother, she fled from him."], [185, "TO BE OR NOT TO BE. 173 How well she remembered it all now ! How with only her jewellery and a small sum of money she made her way to New York, and in a third-rate hotel gave birth to her daughter ! How, when she had recovered from her travail, and her money was nearly gone, she had sought out a theatrical agent, in order to obtain some employment, which might enable her to gain bread for herself and her child ! How he had offered her a trifling engagement, and how she worked at her profession, till, struck by her appearance, an enterprising manager determined to bring her out as a prima donna ! And then the nervous excitement of the first night ! How vividly did the whole scene come before her. Endowed by nature with a voice such as has seldom been heard, she had spent what money she could afford in taking lessons so as to render her delivery more perfect. Nothing could be added to make the movement of her limbs more graceful. Such was she, Avhen she first ventured to sing and dance to a New York audience. From that time her fortune was made. Under the pseudonym of Geramis she was for over two years the star of the theatrical world, courted,"], [186, "174 TO BE, OR NOT TO BE. Avorshipped, and idolized wherever she went. Her fame went throughout all lands ; her name Avas on all lips ; and all the more Avas she raved about because she appeared to be surrounded by a halo of mystery. AVho she was and whence she came, this beautiful creature who danced and sang so as to throw those who listened and gazed at her into a trance of delight, nobody seemed to be able to tell. She smiled now as she thought over that life with its constant travel and incessant work, the flattery of the multitude, and the importunate ad dresses of the few. The recollection of it all might be pleasant, but the reality had been somewhat stern, in spite of the applause which greeted her appearance nightly ou the boards, and in spite of the manner in which she was pointed at by the finger of fame whenever she was seen in public. Yes, she had liked both the applause and the fame, though she was clever enough to see through the hollowness of both; but she had made men under stand that the importunate addresses were far from pleasing to her taste. That had been the great mystery which sur rounded Geramis. She was not only hard to knoAV,"], [187, "TO BE, OR NOT TO BE. 175 but there had never been a breath of scandal against her virtue. At first people had thought it Avas her artfulness, and that she only meant to simulate virtue in order to make a good match ; for the world ever regards womanly virtue as a market able commodity. But the world wondered when it became known that she had refused more thau ono coronet, and that even a crowned head had sued in vain for her favours ; and the world tried to find a reason for her conduct, and found many, all more or less distant from the truth. She smiled as she thought of the reports that had been circulated about her iu those days of her world-wide popularity. Nobody had suggested that she Avas already married and Avas acting to gain the means to educate her child ; nobody Avould have believed it if it had been suggested. How could a Avoman Avith limbs so exquisitely shaped that they were considered the model of perfection, Avith a face faultless iu feature and voluptuous in expression, with eyes which seemed to be but a reflection of love \u2014 how could she find any pleasure in a virtuous life of domestic dulness ? So asked the world with its smile of derisive scarcasm ; and people shrugged"], [188, "176 TO BE, OR NOT TO BE. their shoulders and went their way, satisfied that there must be something in the background of which they were ignorant. Then came her retirement from the stage, and practically her retirement from the world. Perhaps not too soon : virtue is apt to pall in this world. If she had led a life of glorious vice, preying upon men until they were ruined, society would always have thronged to see her and to listen to her. But morality is considered inconvenient now-a-days, and an insult to those Avho do not possess it. So Geramis retired ; and for nine days her retirement was a subject of universal talk, till a new star ap peared, who swore openly, drank champagne, and smoked cigarettes. Geramis was forgotten. Old-fashioned men occa sionally quoted her name at the clubs, but failed to arouse any interest in their listeners. She had gained from the Avorld all that she wanted, suffi cient money to live comfortably, even luxuriously, and to educate her child. For some few years she had lived in an out-of-the-Avay village on the French coast, then as her child grew up she came to reside in London for the benefit of her education. She"], [189, "TO BE, OR NOT TO BE. 177 called herself Mrs. Saxondale, and was supposed to be an American widow ; nobody had recognised her as the once famous Geramis. At least only Chippy, who had guessed it from the sketch in his father's smoking room. A chance remark of his had shown her this, and she had made a virtue of necessity by telling him the truth, or rather, the partial truth, for as yet he did not suspect her identity with Mrs. Massinger. Old Mr. Lionel certainly knew Avho she was, but he had never seen her, and she had never seen him. At all events she had come to London as Mrs. Saxon dale, without either friends or acquaintances, and had virtually succeeded in accomplishing the two most important things she desired. Firstly, she had preserved her incognito ; and, secondly, she had by dint of great tact managed to get received into society. Not the society of the upper ten, certainly, but still the society of ladies and gentle men. Such briefly had been her life; and now, after all these years, she had discovered her husband. She had expected this crisis to arrive some day; but now that it had come, she was at a loss how to act. N"], [190, "TO BE, OR NOT TO BE. 178 For one thing, she had never dreamt of finding him rich, and occupying a high social position, with every appearance of having thrown into oblivion the whole of his gambling life. Again, was his real name Muirsom or Massinger ? Probably Muirsom, she thought, for he must have brought some cre dentials Avith him in order to get into English society. She could ruin his schemes if she Avere to claim him, and gain her revenge for his cruelty in the past. But beyond that, what good would it do her ? None ; positively none. The key to the whole of Mrs. Saxondale's life, since the day she first went on to the stage, had been her love for her daughter Vida. It was this love which had caused her to keep her virtue when the whole world seemed to have combined to make her lose it. For Vida's sake had she toiled to gain money and social position.

A STROKE OF LUCK, Major Stanhope was not the man to let the grass grow under his feet. Having come to the con clusion that Mrs. Saxondale might be able to give him some valuable information in regard to Muirsom, he determined to improve the acquaint ance, and find out what she had to tell him. The Directory told him that there was a Mrs. Saxondale living at Hamilton Terrace, so with this clue to work upon the Major came up to the little village. Fortune favoured him more than he had expected. The same afternoon he arrived in town, strolling down Piccadilly, he happened to run across Chippy. As a rule the Major regarded very young men as rather a nuisance, but Chippy had always been au exception. He was a good rider and he was Aura's cousin, two strong reasons why the Major should take to him; so he stopped and shook hands. \"You seem to be a man of elegant leisure;"], [193, "A STROKE OF LUCK. 181 come Avith me as far as my club, and we will exchange the news OA*er a brandy-and-soda.\" To sit in an easy chair in a club smoking-room, Avith a cigar in the mouth, and a large tumbler of brandy-and-soda at one's elbow, is certainly not the most disagreeable way of killing an hour in the afternoon, while if you have a friend to talk to, the conversation is not apt to flag. Chippy listened with interest to all the news about Haysey and the hunting, and in chattering about himself happened accidentally to mention the name of Mrs. Saxondale, not a very extraordinary circumstance, considering that lady's daughter was generally uppermost in his thoughts. \" Saxondale ! what Saxondale ? \" instantly in quired the Major. \"My dear fellow, how interested you have sud denly become ! I don't suppose you have ever met her. She is an American widow, living in London for the sake of her daughter's education. Tall, dark, and handsome, age about thirty-five. There you have her in a short but accurate description. \" By Jove ! then I will bet it's the same.\" \" What same ? \""], [194, "182 A STROKE OF LUCK. \" I mean I am almost sure I have met her before AVhere did you get introduced to her ? \" \" Oh ! it was rather a romantic affair altogether. Sho introduced herself really,\" and Chippy pro ceeded to tell his listener the story of the church yard incident. He did not say that she was Geramis, for he respected her secret too much ; but Stanhope was an old friend of the Belgarts, and had known his brother, so he thought there could be no harm in telling him about Mrs. Saxondale's relations with that brother. \" She is coming to tea to-morrow afternoon at my diggings : if you care to drop in, do so by all means.\" \" Thanks very much, I will. AVhat ! are you off ? Have another split ? \" \" No ; thanks all the same. I must be going. Good-bye : see you to-morrow then ? \" \"Yes.\" \" Good business that,\" muttered Chippy to himself, as he turned into the street. \" I shall be able to devote myself entirely to Arida. By the bye, the Major did not say where he met Mrs. Saxon dale.\""], [195, "A STROKE OF LUCK. 183 Stanhope of course knew perfectly well the history of Walter Lionel's death ; and, although apparently it had not occurred to Chippy, it struck him at once that Mrs. Saxondale Avas in reality no other than Mrs. Massinger. And she knew Muir som. Muirsom had been gambling or doing something of the sort at San Fraucisco, probably under an assumed name. Mr. John A. Goldmore had told him that. Might uot Muirsom be Hugh Massinger ? And then The Major got up to leave the club. He wanted to think quietly over the joy of his sudden dis cover}'. AVhat a stroke of luck, he thought, that I happened to meet that young Lionel. I only hope it will all prove true. I shall have to be cautious with the Saxondale woman though, for I should think she has got a will of her own. I must first of all find out what her plan of campaign is, and then see if Ave can work together. It was a very pleasant pipe of contemplation that the Major smoked that night. Meanwhile Mrs. Saxondale, having come to the conclusion that Major Stanhope had some cause for disliking Muirsom, had made up her mind to"], [196, "184 A STROKE OF LUCK. take the first opportunity of asking Chippy the reason. She was a clever woman, and thoroughly realized how useful such a man as the Major might be to her, if the exposure of her husband should become a matter of expediency. Her surprise therefore was great when, on entering Chippy's rooms, she found the man she had intended to inquire about, lounging there evidently on terms of intimacy with the proprietor. She was neither pleased nor displeased; she was puzzled and inwardly determined to act exactly as the Major himself had determined ; namely, to wait and see how the land lay before committing herself. \" Now, Mrs. Saxondale, you must pour out tea for me, if you will.\" Chippy soon became engrossed in showing Vida some photographs, and Stanhope and Mrs. Saxon dale were virtually left to a tete-a-tete. \" I did not think I should have the pleasure of meeting you again so soon.\" \"No?\" she replied, dallying with her cup. \"Did you tell Chippy where you had met me ? \" \"No; I did not know for certain whether there"], [197, "A STROKE OF LUCK. 185 might not be two Mrs. Saxondales.

You are an old friend of his ? \" She glanced at Chippy as she asked the question. \" Yes ; I've known him ever since he was a mere child. The Belgarts, who are near relations of his, aud with whom he often stays, are old friends of my family. In days gone by I knew his brother very well ; the one who was shot in San Francisco. By the bye, Chippy told me you had met him in America.\" \" Yes ; I met him in Chicago. He stayed there, poor fellow, with some friends of mine, and I saw him constantly.\" \" So Chippy told me,\" replied the Major. Mrs. Saxondale gave him a sharp look. There was something incredulous in the tone of his reply*, which made her wonder whether he suspected who"], [198, "186 A STROKE OF LUCK. sho Avas. But his face told her nothing ; he Avas glancing indifferently into the fire. \"It seems my destiny to make acquaintauces under curious circumstances. Did you give Chippy such a detailed account as he appears to have given you about the way you first met me ? \" \" No ; do you wish me not to do so ? \" She shrugged her shoulders. \" I hate mystery, and you seem to think there is something mysteri ous about me.\" \" Not at all. Chippy told me that you were an American widow residing in London for the sake of your daughter's education, and he also told mo of your pilgrimage to his brother's grave.

I shall be up in town till the beginning of next week. You must look me up. I am generally in between five and seven.\" \" Thanks ; I will.

He felt like a detective who has suddenly hit upon an important clue, for he had now no doubt in his own mind but that Mrs. Saxondale and Mrs. Massinger were one and the same person. He must find out, he thought, what she intended to do.

Still she might not wish to co-operate"], [202, "190 A STROKE OF LUCK. with him, and without her aid he would be almost helpless to stir in the matter. She could hardly stand quietly by, and see her husband commit bigamy, for she had no reason to hate Aura Bel gart, and exposure before marriage would give her just as ample revenge as exposure afterwards. He supposed that it was revenge she wanted ; well, in that case he would help her to get it ; but still it was essential that he should learn her plans. That reminded him, might it not be part of her purpose to marry her daughter to Chippy ? He could see for himself that afternoon, that, as it was, there was a strong flirtation going on between the two young people; and her evident encouragement to Chippy to come to her house, looked as if she Avould like him to marry her daughter ; therefore, till she had hooked him, she might not like him to know who she really was. There was no need for him to decide to-night ; he would sleep upon it, and determine on his course of action in the morn- ing."], [203, "191 CHAPTER XVIII. VIDA. The Major had been fairly correct in his conjec tures, Avhen he thought that Chippy was in lovo Avith Vida Saxondale. It was a new element in the plot, and it troubled him ; for Chippy was cer tainly what is commonly called an eligible bachelor, and, if he wanted to marry Vida, it would probably have some considerable influence over the conduct of Mrs. Saxondale. He might make love to the girl himself, but that would involve him in great difficulties in regard to Aura ; however, he decided to sleep upon it, and see what his ideas were in the morning. Meanwhile, as Vida Saxondale is destined to play a conspicuous part in this story, it might be of some interest to give a short description of her. She Avas beautiful, certainly ; the most fastidious taste could not have denied that she possessed great beauty, though she was far from being as"], [204, "192 VIDA attractive as her mother had been at her age. Even if she had had the opportunity, she would never have been a second Geramis. Still, she was a girl to look at twice, and a girl who, when she entered into society, would be likely to be the centre of much admiration. She looked essentially distingiu'e ; and those dark eyes, which Avere so fas cinating when she smiled, could flash forth anger and scorn in a way which showed that beneath her laughing countenance there was a haughty temper, difficult to subdue when once aroused. She was now at one of the most trying periods of life for a girl to go through. She was just budding into womanhood. At that age most girls are gawky and ill-shaped in figure, and, from want of experience, foolish in mind. It is the same with the opposite sex; indeed, with boys perhaps it is more exaggerated than with girls ; for, although both grow out of it in time, the process is much longer in the case of the obstinate male. Vida, of course, had this fault, the fault of being young; but it was hardly noticeable, cer tainly not disagreeably so. There was the inno cence and freshness of girlhood, without the savour"], [205, "VIDA 193 of schoolroom bread and butter. She was too young to be blase', but she was old enough to be trusted not to make a fool of herself. She could judge exactly to what limits she could carry out a flirtation without losing either her head or her heart ; aud woe to the man who might think she was faster than she really was, for he would have met with as withering a snub as any mature woman of the world could have given him. In some ways, no doubt, she was precocious ; and her mother rather encouraged her in her precocity than other- Avise, in case people might think her social position ambiguous : then it would be just as well for Vida to know how to hold her own. Besides, she was a girl likely to have many admirers, not impro bably many lovers : surely it would be best for her to be able to judge her own heart accurately, and not to give herself away for the sake of flattery and adulation. Did she love Chippy Lionel ? It Avas a question she was trying to answer in her own mind as she sat in a low chair in front of her bedroom fire, before retiring for the night. She had not known him long, she told herself, hardly more than two months, but she had liked him ever o"], [206, "VIDA 194 since the first day they met. That afternoon, however, as they sat talking and looking at photo graphs, doing more ofthe former thau of the latter it is to be feared, she had suddenly become con scious of a new feeling towards him. Although she had had the good sense not to show it out wardly, she had felt nervous in his company, and had not been so friendly and unreserved towards him as usual. \"Is this love?\" she asked herself; and the question was difficult to answer. It was the birth of love at all events, but who can tell at its birth Avhether love will ripeu and bear fruit? Individual fancy may cause it first to grow; but whether it shall attain maturity, or whether it shall be nipped in the bud, lies in the hands of an inexorable fate. Love is a passion, which lies peut up and hidden, till some slight chance or mere accident comes, and then it bursts forth and blossoms in full colour. Pity, that so fair a flower should often be destined so soon to wither. Yet such is the perverse folly of human ity, that it can seldom last a lifetime, and generally lapses into decay before the baneful influence of satiety."], [207, "VIDA 195 Yes ; in love, as in most other things, we poor mortals are the slaves of chance. There is a tide in the affairs of man, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune : cui bono, when Ave don't know when the tide is at the flood ? An accidental touch, a chance expression, a mere glance from a pair of eyes, and we suddenly become aware of a love given and returned, and that the tide of love is at the flood. But how often is the opportunity wanting, and the two people who ought to have been united in a life-long union of body and soul, drift hopelessly apart, never to meet again, or, worse still, to meet when it is too late. So, Vida, you, leaving girlhood behind you, and entering the stage of womanhood, with all its sor rows and its joys, you have already discovered the birth of love within your heart. So be it ; it is but the experience of all the sex, otherwise they Avould not be women. Even now the discovery makes you blush, as you sit in the privacy of your room. Proud, with the hot blood of the Mexican race flowing in your veins, love with you will mean a pas sion that knoAvs no bounds ; but it will be a passion that neglect will change into undying hatred."], [208, "VIDA 196 She rose at length with a sigh. The night be fore she had been a mere girl, now she was a Avoman. Startling discovery; startling, because she was afraid lest she should unconsciously be tray herself. Before sleep came to her that night, she made a solemn vow that she would place such a guard over her feelings that he should never know her love till \u2014 he should confess his own. Sleep on, proud with the pride of pure woman hood. If there be any truth in that mystic belief of spiritualism, Avhich asserts that during the un consciousness of the body the soul may hold communion with a kindred soul, so that together they may wander throughout dreamland, then surely did that communion take place this night. For he, too, has become aware of the power of love and of its dominion. So it is ; the dawn of love has taken place, will it rise till it attains its midday heat, or will it be hidden by the clouds which deny it the opportunity of displaying its burning force, and then set in the darkness of oblivion ?"], [209, "197 CHAPTER XIX. THE MAJOR IS AGAIN BAFFLED. The drawing-room at Mrs. Saxondale's house in Hamilton Terrace was a curiously shaped room. A large alcove, hung Avith heavy plush curtains, at one end formed an entrance into an inner and smaller room, though it also had a door opening into the passage outside. In the larger of these two apartments the lady of the house was accus tomed to receive formal callers, while the smaller served as a sort of boudoir, to which only her in timate friends had the entre. Amongst the latter was Chippy, who was in the habit of being regu larly shown into this sanctum, a privilege which, from the frequent use he made of it, he might fairly be judged to fully appreciate. It was extra ordinary how the bond of union, which had its foundation in the death of AValter Lionel, had become cemented between Chippy and the Saxon-"], [210, "THE MAJOR IS AGAIN BAFFLED. 198 dales. At first both mother and daughter had liked him, and the liking had been mutual, so that the boy was constantly to be seen wending his way towards Maida Vale. But, as has already been disclosed, a deeper and more potent feeling than mere liking had suddenly sprung up. Chippy had fallen in love with A7ida, and there was no doubt that she returned his love. As yet of course no thing had been said between the two from which either could gather what was the real state of their thoughts. But it was only a matter of time and opportunity. Even Mrs. Saxondale, foreseeing the possibility of such an event, did not suspect that the pleasure which they evidently found in each other's company had ripened into any sentiment of a more serious nature. She was uneasy in her own mind as to Avhether it would be good for their mutual happiness that such a sentiment should so ripen. Yet she did not attempt to discourage the boy in his visits. So the two Avere thrown much together, with the inevitable consequence that they fell in love while hardly realizing what they felt. On the afternoon following that night, when Vida had first discovered that she Avas in love,"], [211, "THE MAJOR IS AGAIN BAFFLED. 199 Chippy strolled up into Maida Vale, and learning that Mrs. Saxondale was at home, went up into the boudoir, dispensing with the formality of being announced. The boudoir was empty, but he heard Mrs. Saxondale's voice in the adjoining room, and was about to push aside the curtains and enter, when another voice, which he recognised as be longing to Major Stanhope, made him pause on the threshold. He would have considered it mean and dishonourable to play the part of eaves-dropper under most circumstances; but the Major's words made him stop to listen. The result of the Major's review of the situation after his night's rest was that he determined to go at once to see Mrs. Saxondale, and tax her Avith being Mrs. Massinger and the wife of Muirsom. If it was true, the sudden accusation Avould throw her off her guard, and she Avould betray herself; Avhile, if false, Avell, he should offend her no doubt, but in that case her friendship would be of little value to him, so the risk of losing it was not a very important matter. She received him in the drawing-room Avith her usual gracious manner. \" I am flattered that you"], [212, "THE MAJOR IS AGAIN BAFFLED. 200 have beeu so speedy in coming to call ou me, Major Stanhope.\" \" It's very kind of you to say so,\" said the Major, as he took the chair to which she had motioned him. \" The truth is, I wanted to see you on some very urgent matters.

Mrs. Saxondale was not the woman to faint, but the afternoon had been too much for her, and, putting her hands before her face, she burst into tears.

Chippy lost no time in fulfilling the promise he had made to Mrs. Saxondale, to go down and see Muirsom. The next day he took the early train down to Haysey, and walked across the fields from the station to Muirsom's house. So long as he had been employed in acting, it had all seemed clear sailing to him ; but when he turned into the drive, the difficult nature of his errand forced itself upon his mind. He knew that he ought to hate Muirsom; and yet, as a matter of truth, he liked him, and felt heartily sorry for him. Besides, he was Vida's father. He Avondered what his people would say when he told them he was going to marry the daughter of the man who had killed his brother. Would his father be angry ? He should have to go down and see him, that was evident. Then there was Aura, and Sir Henry Belgart, to take into consideration.

Yes, he Avould Avait; so he went iuto the study to sit down and try and think over the matter. AVhen one sits down with the intention of de liberately thinking over a certain subject, it is astonishing how difficult it is to concentrate the thoughts. Other things seem to force themselves upou the mind, and one gets up again without having arrived at any definite conclusion. So it Avas now. Chippy tried to think how he should break the news to Muirsom ; but when that gentle man made his appearance, he Avas as much at a loss how to begiu as Avhen he first entered the study. \" AVhy, Chippy, this is a pleasant surprise, AYhat on earth has brought you down here ?

The fact of his having shot a man in San Francisco was not much of itself; but it is awkward to be brought to book for it by the brother, more especially when you are going to marry one of the family. He had often wondered what he should do if that little episode in his life were to become known. He had tried to forget it himself, ever since he had turned over a new leaf. But the recollection could not always be banished. Now Nemesis was at hand. \" AVhat do you mean ? \" was all he dare ask \"AVell, it appears you travelled under the assumed name of Massinger in San Francisco some fifteen or sixteen years ago.\" \"0 God!\" he interrupted, \"and it has come to light at last.

He had often thought since that he had wronged her, and had wondered what had become of her when his harsh sarcasm made her run away from him. So she had developed into Geramis, and had taken the world by storm with her beauty, and her voice ; and she had brought up his daughter, and educated her by dint of her own hard work.

THE VIRTUE OF ADVERSITY IS FORTITUDE. It is said that the present is an undemonstrative age ; but in all times the proud mau has been careful not to display his inner feelings to the eyes of the world. So Muirsom, while talking with Chippy, had been able not to betray the depth of the grief Avhich had thus suddenly come upon him. Although all his hopes had been shattered at a blow, he had appeared outwardly calm. He would have con sidered it cowardly to parade his sorrow before the eyes of others. If he had suffered a defeat in the great battle of life, it was not for him to publish it. But when he was left alone to grapple with his misfortunes, then the weight of them seemed to be heavier than he could bear. Nemesis had come at last ; the follies of his boyhood had found him out.

For fifteen years had he held the reputation of a man of honour, and by his own talents had won a high social position; he had gained the love of a woman for whom he would have sacrificed his life ; in every way he had met Avith success. Now all was lost. He unfastened the window, which opened down to the floor, and stepped out on to the lawn. The short December afternoon Avas already merging into dusk, and the wind was whistling amongst the black trunks of the trees, driving before it a cold drizzling rain. But he noticed neither the cold nor the wet as he strode along in the impatience of his thoughts. So he had sown his wild oats, and the time for the harvest had come. He remembered the day when, hardly more than a boy, he had found himself alone in the world, through what he then considered the harsh injustice of his uncle; and how, having been used to wealth, he was turned adrift as a pauper.

But its lessons sickened him. As a boy, he had shown great promise of intellectual power; and after the novelty of his new life had Avorn away, aud he had become satiated with adventure, his vices disgusted him, and he pined for the quietness of civilization. Fortunately for him, at that time the death of the uncle, whom he had taught himself to hate, caused him to become the possessor of great wealth; so he put the ocean between the scenes of his youth and himself, and came to England, where he trained his mind to forget his former life. And now, after fifteen years, an avenging pro vidence had forced recollection upon him, and demanded of him the punishment Avhich, sooner or later, it never fails to demand from mortals. Bare-headed and wet to the skin, he paced through the woods, hardly conscious of what he was doing, or whither he was going.

More probably so. I alone am the cause of this trouble. Why should I blame an abstract idea? Pshaw ! I have studied philosophy, and thought over all the systems of religious doctriue that the world has ever seen ; and now that the test of adversity has come, I find no comfort in any of them, but have only myself to rely upon.

Muirsom and Chippy went up to town by the first train on the Friday morning, as they had arranged. They spoke but little on the journey, for each was unwilling to encroach on the privacy of the other's thoughts. So the train whirled them up to the London terminus, together with hundreds of others, going on various errands, some on business and some on pleasure, but all careful only of themselves and utterly careless of their neighbours ; such is the selfishness of human nature. \" I shall go home to my diggings. You knoAV my address, in case you want to see me.\" \"Yes; thanks.\" And Muirsom hailed a hansom, and drove off to Maida Vale. He was going to see his wife for the first time for over fifteen years.

Yes, he confessed to himself, he had treated her badly, very badly ; it was a mercy of Providence that he had not now to reproach himself with her ruin, instead of being the unconscious instrument of having made her celebrated. He had often heard of Geramis iu the days when her fame was at its summit, and he had heard of the virtue which was on all hands attributed to her. She might have been a countess if she had liked, O ** or she might have been the mistress of royalty ; but in the midst of all her triumphs she had never permitted herself to enjoy love or any semblance of love. So much he had heard at the time, and now he could not help but feel pleased at it. She had a daughter, too, his daughter ; and he had been a father so long without knowing it ! Why, he asked himself, had he never taken the trouble to make any inquiries about her ? She must loathe him, he thought, if ever a wife had the right to hate her husband."], [242, "MORS, FALCE OMNIA STERNENS. 230 Thus ruminating, he found himself at her house in Hamilton Terrace, and rang the bell. \"Is Mrs. Saxondale at home? \" he asked. \" Yes, sir ! but she is very seriously ill ; the doctor is with her now, sir,\" said the servant, standing at the door as if to bar his passage. He walked hastily into the hall without ceremony. \" Take that card to your mistress immediately, and say I am Avaiting below. Do you hear me ? \" \" Yes, sir ; but I am afraid Mrs. Saxondale won't be able to see you.\" \"Be as good as to do what you're told.

Is that you come at last ? \" \" Don't you know me, Jessie ? \" \" Yes ; I am glad you have come. Are you angry with me for sending for you ? \" And this was her reproach to him \u2014 to him who had done his best to ruin her, and then neglected her.

He bent softly over her, and touched her lips with his in the kiss of peace. \" Hugh, I should never have disturbed you in your new life; but others found out all about our relations, so I sent for you, that you might hear the story from me.

Her daughter would not be left amongst strangers, as had ever been her dread. \" Shall I send for her ? \" he asked. Her face brightened ; he had guessed the great longing in her mind, namely, to see the union of father and daughter. He rang the bell ; and Vida herself came in answer to it. She stopped, astonished at seeing a stranger; but her mother motioned her to her bedside. \" Vida, my darling, this is my husband and your father,\" she said in broken words, which showed but too plainly the effort it was for her to speak."], [247, "MORS, FALCE OMNIA STERNENS. 235 \" My father ! \" she stood still for a moment, looking steadfastly at Muirsom ; then, as if by the sudden prompting of her instinct, nature seemed to assert herself, and the girl threw her arms round his neck and kissed him. He held her in his embrace for a few seconds, then, kissing her on the forehead, and still keeping his hand on her shoulder, he turned towards the bed. \" May my love and care for her be my atone ment to you ! \" An expression of infinite bliss came over her wan countenance. In her life she had toiled for her daughter, she had been the only thing she loved; for her sake she had renounced all the power, which, as Geramis, she might have wielded ; and her chief care had been, what would become of her Avhen she, her mother, was taken away. She saw her now in the arms of her father, and she would die happy. \" Hugh, raise me up in your arms.\" He did as she asked him. \" Vida, you will lose a mother, but you have gained a father; love him for my sake.

There was a smile of joy on her face, as if she were satisfied Avith the end of her earthly labours. So was death merciful, and her spirit passed calmly away, floating into those mysterious realms where there is neither toil nor sorrow. One more soul had gone to join the great majority. Of the minority left behind, two only would mourn for her, though she had won the applause and admira tion of millions.

They had remembered her for a week, and then they found a new favourite, and she was forgotten.

The two predominant feelings in his mind were to do his duty as a father towards Vida, and at once to unreservedly confess the whole truth to Aura. He determined to lose no time before going down to Belgart Towers, for he knew that every moment was of value, if, as he wished to happen, Aura should hear the story first of all from his lips. He could easily go to Haysey and back in a day ; so on the Sunday morning he told Vida that business connected with her mother's death obliged him to leave town for the day, but that he should return in the evening, and that in the meantime Mrs. Goodfield had promised to come round and sit Avith her. He had a difficult task to perform, for he Avas going to humble himself in the eyes of the girl he"], [252, "THE MAJOR FINDS HIS M AS TER. 240 loved, and who had promised to become his wife. But it Avas a task he would not allow himself to shrink from performing. She might loathe him for his deceit, but that would even be preferable to again deceiving her. She should know the whole truth, and then he would throw himself upon her mercy, and she could either reject him or accept him. He walked from Haysey across the fields towards Belgart Towers. It was a bright December morn ing, and all around there reigned the peaceful calm and quietness of an English Sabbath. There Avas no living soul about to disturb his thoughts and jar upon his feelings. In front of him, rising out of the surrounding woods, as if proud of their mas sive strength, he could see the tAvin keeps, from which the country seat of the Belgarts had taken its name, rearing their towers high above the trees, and keeping guard over the neighbouring lands. In the middle ages they had served as citadels, from Avhich archers had shot their arrows ; now they served but as a token of the ancient grandeur of the family who owned them. And it was the daughter of that family he was on his way to see."], [253, "THE MAJOR FINDS HIS MASTER, 241 AVhat would she think of him ? Would she be lieve that he had never intended to deceive her ? Or would she believe him to be a liar and a traitor ? He should soon know. Fortitude is ever the virtue of adversity, and he would be brave, even though she might think he had been a coAvard. He had reached the Avoods now, and was wend ing his way along the grass rides doAvn which he had so often cantered, with her cantering by bis side. Ah ! would those happy rides ever be re peated ? In them he thought he had realized the highest bliss which could come to him on earth. Was that bliss only to be a dream of the past ? or would it be a reality of the future ? He had hither to been accustomed to meet with success in the struggle of life, he thought; he would not now contemplate failure. The road along which he was walking terminated at a five-bar gate which led into a small paddock, which in its turn was only divided from the gar dens by a sunk fence. AVhen he came in sight of the gate he was surprised to see a man sitting on it, with his back towards him. Was it? Yes; there could be no doubt it was Major Stanhope. K"], [254, "THE MAJOR FINDS HIS MASTER. 242 For a moment Muirsom hesitated, for Stanhope was the last man in the Avorld that he wished to meet at that moment. But it was not in his nature to turn back. Besides, might not Stanhope be going on the same errand that he himself was ? If so, it Avas above all things necessary that he should be beforehand with him. He knew the Major hated him as a man can only hate his successful rival in love, and he would not be likely to be over scrupulous in regard to the truth. There was one comfort, however, if Aura did dismiss him, it was not probable uoav that the Major Avould ever stand in his shoes. At the sound of his footsteps Stanhope turned round, and Muirsom saw a look of anger come into his face when he recognised him. He seemed dis concerted too, as if he were surprised to see him, besides beiug evidently displeased. \"Good morning,\" he said, in reply to Muirsom's salutation. \" Are you on your way to the Towers ? \" \" Yes.\" \" Et moi aussi. Shall we go together ? \" \" Only just in time,\" thought Muirsom, as he replied, \u2014"], [255, "THE MAJOR FINDS HIS MASTER. 243 \" They will hardly be out of church yet. Are you stopping to lunch ? \" \" I don't know. I want to see Sir Henry on a matter of business.\" \" Business ? I always thought you were a man of pleasure, except so far as horses were con cerned.\" The Major did not like anybody suggesting that he made money out of horseflesh, and he was irri tated at the other's answer. \"I am not a professional horse-dealer,\" he re plied, \" nor a professional gambler either.\" \" You consider it more gentlemanly to be an amateur, Major. Perhaps you are right. At any rate, it is more profitable to treat with friends than with strangers.\" \" Do you mean to insult me ? \" Muirsom shrugged his shoulders. \" If so, allow me to inform you I may prove more dangerous than you found young Lionel to be at San Francisco.\" He looked at Muirsom as he spoke, as if he expected him to show signs of fear. But he was disappointed. Muirsom looked utterly indifferent."], [256, "THE MAJOR FINDS niS MASTER. 244 \"Hardly as dangerous, I think,\" he said; \"for you fight with words only. AValter Lionel had the courage of action.\" \"Which is not always commendable when the action takes the form of bigamy. At least, I shouldn't think either Sir Henry or Miss Belgart would think so. I dare say they will tell you their opinion this afternoon though, for I give you fair warning that I am on my way to expose you, and show them what a scoundrel you are.\" \"And I give you fair warning that you are going to do nothing of the sort. Thanks to your under hand detective conduct, I found out this Aveek that I had a wife alive. I am now going to tell Miss Belgart of that discovery. I will also tell her, if you like, how you had to leave my wife's house for fear of being thrashed, like the cur that you are.\" The Major was no coward. He sprang at Muirsom, and struck a blow at his face with all his might, which it required all the other's agility to avoid. He had been a proficient in the noble art of holding up the hands, aud, his blood now thoroughly- aroused, he determined to make use of"], [257, "THE MAJOR FINDS HIS MASTER. 245 all his skill aud science ; so the two men were soon engaged in the midst of blows. Stanhope had lost all mastery over his feelings ; he only knew that he was fighting the man he hated more than anybody else in the Avorld, and he would have liked to have killed him. So on that quiet Sabbath morning these two men fought. The tit-mice aud the wrens chirped amongst the boughs overhead, and all nature seemed in harmony. Everywhere arouud there was peace, except where the two men were in dulging their angry passions. Yet men are supposed to have reason, and are considered the lords of creation. For some moments did they fight Avithout either gaining the advantage, till at last, Stanhope iu striking over-reached himself, aud, dropping his guard arm for a second, received Muirsom's blow straight iu the face. He reeled for an instant, and then fell backwards, the blood spouting out of his nose and mouth. And the birds still chirped amongst the trees, indifferent to the strife of mau Dazed and giddy from his fall, the Major slowly"], [258, "246 THE MAJOR FINDS HIS MASTER. managed to get up, while Muirsom leant against the gate with folded arms. \" You've beaten me now, but I hate you, aud I always shall hate you. You robbed me of the only girl I loved, that's why I hate you. Damn you ! Go to her and tell her your story.\" And the Major walked off in the direction of Haysey. \" Well, perhaps it is for the best,\" muttered Muirsom to himself; \" and now to see Aura.\" And he Avalked across the paddock and thence to the house."], [259, "CHAPTER XXIV. THE COUNTERVAIL OF JOY. Muirsom was shown upstairs into the boudoir, which formed Aura's sanctum ; nor did the girl herself keep him long waiting. \" AVhy, Bertie, I expected you yesterday. AVhy didn't you come ? \" She came up to him and kissed him, as she asked the question. \" But what is the matter? You don't look a bit like yourself.\" \" Aura, I have got something very important to tell you.\" She looked up at him in amazement, startled at the serious tone of his voice. \" There are certain things iu my past life Avhich you must know before you marry me. God knows, perhaps, when you know them, you will spurn me from you.\" \"Don't talk in that way, Bert. You know I love you too much to spurn you, as you call it. 217"], [260, "THE COUNTERVAIL OF JOY. 248 I am not a fool. I know all men sow their Avild oats when they are young.\" She was sitting beside him on the sofa, and her presence seemed to give him courage even more than her words. She put her hand on his shoulder and went on speaking to reassure him. \" Whatever y*ou have done, I feel sure that you never did anything dishonourable. Don't be afraid to tell me.\" \" No, Aura, I am not afraid for myself; I am only afraid that I may give you pain. You know that my father died a poor man, and that what money I've got I had from an uncle.\" \" Yes.\" \" From the time my father died till I succeeded to my uncle's property I was very poor, far too poor to live an idle life in New York ; so I went off in quest of adventure into Mexico and Texas, under an assumed name. That assumed name was Massinger.\" \" Massinger ? Oh, Bert ! Then you aro the man who shot my cousin AValter. Oh, Heaven ! Avhat will my father say ? \" \" The question is, What do you say ? Aura, I"], [261, "THE COUNTERVAIL OF JOY. 249 swear to you that I killed him iu a fair duel. It Avas no murder.\" \" I believe you ! I believe you ! It would have been coAvardice to murder him, and I am sure you were never a coward. But \" \" But what, my darling ? \" \" You had a wife,\" she murmured half iuaudibly. \" I had ; but Ave were separated soon after our marriage, and I came over to England Avithin a very short time after that.\" \" But you have heard of her since.\" \" I never heard of her till last Thursday.\" \" Till last Thursday ! AVhat ! is she alive ?\" She had got up from the sofa by his side as she asked the question, and stood before him in her anxiety to learn the truth. \" No ; she is dead.\" She sank down again on to the sofa, relieved by his answer. She never thought that he had de ceived her ; she only knew that she loved him. \" Yes ; she is dead. She died on Friday. Directly I heard she was alive I went up to town, and Avas just in time to see her before her death. In fact, she died in my arms.\""], [262, "THE COUNTERVAIL OF JOY. 250 Then he told her the whole of his story. Hoav his wife had toiled for the sake of her daughter, till she had become the once famous Geramis. How she had then retired from the splendour of the stago in order that she might the better educate that daughter ; and how, now that the girl over whom she had watched with more than a mother's care Was blossoming into Avomanhood, death had seized her for its prey. \"And, Aura, I have come to you to tell you everything. Can you forgive me for having deceived you, and for having so shamefully ne glected my first wife ? Cau you forgive me, and still love me?\" \" Forgive you ? I can't help forgiving you Avhen I love you as I do.\" He pressed her to him, and kissed her lips in thanks. A mighty Aveight had been taken from his mind. An hour before, and he was in all the agony of doubt ; now he was in the happiness of certainty. \" I thank you, darling, from the bottom of my heart.\" For some moments they neither of them spoke"], [263, "THE COUNTERVAIL OF JOY. 251 a word. They were enjoying in silence the joy of mutual confidence. There had been a secret between them, and now that secret had been de stroyed ; and they Avere happy in the destruction. The girl was the first to speak. \" Bert, I must know your daughter. Poor Vida, she must feel very sad and lonely. She must come down here; for in the future our home AviU be her home.\" \" I am afraid not, my darling.\" \"AVhy not?\" \" AVell, the truth is, Chippy wants to marry her ; and from Avhat I can see, she is not at all averse to marrying him.\" \"No ; not really ! Tell me all about it.\" So he told her how Chippy had made Mrs. Saxondale's acquaintance, and how he had been a constant visitor at her house, till he had fallen in love with Vida, and told him that he meant to ask her to be his wife. \" But he has not done so at present ; she may refuse him.\" \" She may, but I don't think she will. I men tioned his name casually to her yesterday, and, if the expression of the face can betray the state of"], [264, "252 THE COUNTERVAIL OF JOY. the mind, Chippy's name Avas of more thau usual interest to her.\" \" AVell, I shall go up to London and bring her back with me after the funeral.\" \" Sir Henry may not like it.\" \" Sir Henry- will like what I like.\" \" Aura, I can never thank you sufficiently for Avhat you've said to me to-day. I can ouly give you my love in exchange for all your goodness.\" \"And that will be more than enough. But now I've got a revelation to make to you, though I candidly confess, that, if it hadn't been for what you have told me this morning, I should never have made it.\" \" I can guess what it is before you speak. You mean Stanhope. There, now, dou't tell me any more.\" \" Yes, I Avill. Oh, Bert ! do you know he had the insolence to kiss me that day of the fall, when I was unconscious.\" \" The cad ! I am glad I gave him what he deserved.\" Aud he told her of the incident in the Avood. \"If I had known of this, though,\" he added, \"he should not have got off so cheaply.\""], [265, "THE COUNTERVAIL OF JOY. 253 \" Well, I don't think he will repeat his insults again, you may be sure.\" Sir Henry Belgart had gone out, and would not be expected home till dinner-time. So the two lunched alone, and sat through the Sunday after noon, happier in each other's company than they had ever been before. They talked of their plans for the future, and of Vida. It was strange that, although women are popularly supposed to be tho victims of jealousy in a stronger degree than men, Aura had no such feeling. She was too proud to be suspicious. Her heart told her that Muirsom loved her and that she loved him ; what more did she want ? What did it matter to her if in years gone by he had loved another with a passing passion ? Now he was no longer held in bondage ; ho Avas free, and he made her a present of his freedom. If he had treated his former wife with neglect, Avould not she help him to atone for his fault by extending her love to his daughter? She Avould be his wife, and all that Avas his would be hers. Is not the love of woman, sympathy ? And perfect sympathy allows no thought of self. He was obliged to leave her at last, for he had to catch the evening train back to London."], [266, "254 THE COUNTERVAIL OF JOY. \"I will Avrite to-morrow, when I have seen father, and will either come up to London myself to bring back Vida, or ask you to bring her. Tell her that I am her friend. Good-bye ! AVe shall meet again soon.\" She watched him till he disappeared in the gloom of the evening ; then she went back iuto the house. \" How could I refuse to forgive him, when the woman he wronged forgave him,\" she said to her self. And she felt supremely happy in her love. But the screech-owls, dire prophets of disasters, uttered their shrill cries as they wended their flight on their nocturnal journeys. As she shut the door behind her, a figure slunk from out of the shadow of the building and rapidly crossed the gardeus into the paddock beyond. Dense darkness had succeeded the twilight of the evening as Muirsom went on his way towards Haysey; but he knew Avell the path through the woods and across the fields, and did not hesitate to take it. He walked down the grass ride, plunged in deep thought, for the sense of t\\\\e great happi ness which had come to him well-nigh overwhelmed him. Hark! Was that a footstep ? He paused to"], [267, "THE COUNTERVAIL OF JOY. 255 listen, but everything around seemed bathed in the pitchy darkness of night. It must have been a trick of fancy. But, no, he heard it again, and this time more distinctly. Somebody was following him, some rustic yokel probably on his way to the town, or perhaps a poacher. But the steps came nearer. He stopped. \" Who's that ? \" te T >> There was a sudden flash, and, after one convul sive movement of his hand to his heart, he fell forwards on the ground. And the screech-owls screeched forth their dole ful cries in mournful chorus. That evening Major Stanhope went by train up to London."], [268, "256 CHAPTER XXV. THE MAJOR'S FATE. Spain, lovely Spain, the land of all that is beautiful, who can do justice to thee ? Famed for thy be witching women, thy luxuriant verdure, and thy celestial climate, no wonder that all who have visited thee adore thee ever afterwards, and cherish thy memory as the happiest recollection of their lives. Land of romance and poetry, whose every field teems with legends of heroic deeds, or chivalrous gallantry. Thou, who once madest Europe shake with fear at thy arrogance, hast indeed sunk to feed the fancies of poets with themes for their songs. On the north coast, far from the regions of civilization, lies a little hamlet. It has but few inhabitants, and these earn a scanty livelihood from the produce of the sea. All is fish which comes into their nets, and they seize with greedy joy the offspring of the tempest, which is often-"], [269, "THE MAJOR'S FATE. 257 times hurled on to the beach. They are rude, almost to barbarity, having no sense of God in their souls. But they are hardy, and they try their best to enjoy life. They are the children of Spain, and Spain is the land of love. They have their dark-eyed maidens, who make one think they must have been born of fairies, so lightly do they glide in sylph-like movements; and when they have sufficient food to keep body and soul together, they dance and sing and make love. Yes, they enjoy life, though they sometimes find it hard. The night was closing in and black clouds had gathered in the sky. Already a strong breeze, which threatened soon to become a gale, was blow ing towards the shore. Two men were standing on the beach looking out towards the sea. They were fishermen, fishers of wrecks as well as of fish, and beside them, clad in short, bright coloured petticoats, were their sweethearts, hand some women, uniting strength and grace in their round limbs. \" 'Twill be a dark night and a rough one.\" \" Ay ! and probably good Avork for us to do. You must keep the kettle boiling to-night, lass; s"], [270, "THE MAJOR'S FATE. 258 for the water will be cold, and we shall need a dram if there be any work to do.\" \" We'll do our part, never fear,\" answered the girl. \"And you shall have your share of the spoil.\" \" Come in now and get a warm.\" \" For maybe ye'll have cold work to do before 33 morning. And the four walked towards a small hut, sheltered between two large rocks. A wood fire was smouldering in the room as they entered, and one of the women stirred it up, and heaped more logs upon it, while the other hastened to get the men their evening drams. Outside, the gale was blowing hard, and the waves beat furiously against the shore ; and, driven before the wind, a small sailing vessel was career ing madly along at the mercy of the tempest. \" Hark ! I heard a gun ! there it goes again : 'tis the signal of distress.\" The two men jumped to their feet from where they had been reclining before the fire, and went to the door. \" I see her lights ; she can't be more than three hundred yards from the rocks.\""], [271, "THE MAJOR'S FATE. 259 No beacon fire was ever lit upon those rocks to warn the seamen of their presence. Swiftly was the vessel borne along by the fury of the hurricane. There was no hope of safety; destruction and death were before her and all her crew, for who could live in that angry sea with its waves beating against the sharp rocks ? On she came towards her doom ; then there was a crash, a few helpless plunges, and she sank. The two fishermen ran rapidly to the beach below the rocks, to be ready to seize the prey which would be washed up by the waves. Others soon joined them ; and before long all th e men of the village were gathered on the shore. \"No chance of any lives being saved in a sea like this,\" said one. They were not murderers, these wreckers. On the contrary, they had often shown great bravery in saving life. It was the cargo, not the crew, that they wanted. The ship had broken in pieces, and the waves washed up the debris of the wreck or dashed it against the rocks, where it got jammed. The wreckers busied themselves in moving all that"], [272, "260 THE MAJOR'S FATE. could be of any use beyond high-water mark, and the beach soon presented an animated scene. Occasionally a corpse would be dashed on to the shore ; then they would rapidly examine it, to see if life had become extinct ; if there was any hope, the body was carried immediately to one of the huts and left to the care of the women, to whose simple remedies more than one shipwrecked pas senger had owed his or her life. On this night, however, the gale had done its murderous work only too speedily and surely. The sea, lashed to fury by the hurricane, tossed corpse after corpse on to the beach, but it had first robbed them all of life. The fishermen moved quickly amongst them, for they lost no time in doing their work. The sea had given them up its dead, and they were not loath to accept the present. One of the two men who had foretold the storm in the evening, was bending over a body which the waves had just washed up. The features still retained the stern expression which showed how fiercely the man had battled with death before he was overcome. To the fishermen he was a rich"], [273, "THE MAJOR'S FATE. 261 prize, for he was dressed well, and there was a considerable sum of money in his pocket. \" I wonder who he is,\" muttered the man. \" He don't seem like one of the crew, and yet it was not a passenger ship. Ha ! here's a note-book. I'll take it to the girl, she can read.\" The night's work was nearly over, and the fishermen soon went back to their homes. \" Just give a glance at this note-book, lass. I got it from one of the bodies.\" The girl took the book and opened it. \" It has got ' Wilson Stanhope ' written on the first page,\" she said after a moment. So the Major met his doom."], [274, "262 CHAPTER XXVI. PEACE AT LAST. The early summer had come, and nature had again clothed the country in its garb of bright green foliage. Fortunate are the people who can with stand the folly of fashion, and remain in the country during the months of May and June, instead of plunging into the whirl of the London season, with all its heat and hurry, and incessant round of dissipation. We live now on the principle that life is short, and we therefore strive to crowd as much pleasure into the day as we possibly can, and forget that there is joy to be found in calm as Avell as in bustle. Sir Henry Belgart and Aura had not gone up to town for the season. Muirsom's death had of course created a tremendous sensation in Grass shire and had supplied the county with gossip, which lasted till some fresh scandal arose ; but to the household at Belgart Towers it had caused great grief. The blow seemed to have robbed"], [275, "PEACE AT LAST. 263 Aura's life of all its joy. The expression on her countenance had completely changed, and become one of permanent sorrow. She had tasted the sweet ness of love and she mourned for the loss of it. She kept the promise she had made to her dead lover, and had lost no time in going to see Vida ; she had brought the orphan girl back with her, and had insisted on her making Belgart Towers her home. The two girls in the sympathy of grief soon became inseparable, and loved each other like sisters. They led a quiet life with but few incidents to disturb the repose they seemed to seek. Occasionally Chippy would come down from London for a day or two, but he was almost their only visitor. Aura had ample opportunities of noticing for herself the feelings which he and Vida felt for each other, and wondered when the boy would confess his love. It was a bright June afternoon, and all around was quiet, save for the gentle breeze of the wind as it rustled the foliage, and wafted through the air the scent from the lilac blossoms. Chippy had come down from town in time for lunch ; and he and Aura and Vida were sitting on the lawn"], [276, "PEACE AT LAST. 264 in the shade of the old elm-trees. He had come down determined to tell Vida of his love, and ask her to give him his answer. He might be young, but is not youth the time for joy and love ? Suddenly Aura rose to go into the house to fetch a book, aud he was left alone with Vida. They were both silent now, though but a moment before the conversation had been brisk. He moved closer towards her, and put his arm gently round her. \" Vida, my darling, do you love me ? \" She did not answer him in words, but her head rested on his shoulder, and he knew that she was his. \" Come what sorrow may, It caDnot countervail this interchange of joy. As Aura came back on to the lawn she saw that the confession had been made, and that Chippy had got his answer ; and she prayed that their love might not be like hers. And there came a look into her eyes as if she were yearning after that which was ever denied her, for the countervail of joy had come to her heart. FINIS.
